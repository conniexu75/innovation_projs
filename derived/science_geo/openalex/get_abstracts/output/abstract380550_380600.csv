Despite impressive initial clinical responses, the majority of patients eventually develop some degree of resistance to Taxol-based therapy. The mechanisms underlying cancer cells resistance to Taxol are not fully understood. MicroRNA (miRNA) has emerged to play important roles in tumorigenesis and drug resistance. However, the interaction between the development of Taxol resistance and miRNA has not been previously explored. In this study we utilized a miRNA array to compare the differentially expressed miRNAs in Taxol-resistant and their Taxol-sensitive parental cells. We verified that miR-125b, miR-221, miR-222, and miR-923 were up-regulated in Taxol-resistant cancer cells by real-time PCR. We further investigated the role and mechanisms of miR-125b in Taxol resistance. We found that miR-125b was up-regulated in Taxol-resistant cells, causing a marked inhibition of Taxol-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis and a subsequent increase in the resistance to Taxol in cancer cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 antagonist killer 1 (Bak1) is a direct target of miR-125b. Down-regulation of Bak1 suppressed Taxol-induced apoptosis and led to an increased resistance to Taxol. Restoring Bak1 expression by either miR-125b inhibitor or re-expression of Bak1 in miR-125b-overexpressing cells recovered Taxol sensitivity, overcoming miR-125-mediated Taxol resistance. Taken together, our data strongly support a central role for miR-125b in conferring Taxol resistance through the suppression of Bak1 expression. This finding has important implications in the development of targeted therapeutics for overcoming Taxol resistance in a number of different tumor histologies.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in American women. Paclitaxel (Taxol) has recently emerged as an important chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of breast cancer as well as other tumor histologies, such as ovarian, prostate, and non-small cell lung cancers (1Henley D.

Biol. 2007; 608: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The resistance of cancer cells to Taxol and other chemotherapeutic agents frequently results in the subsequent recurrence and metastasis of cancer (3Chen L.P. Cai S.M. Fan J.X. Li Z.T. Gynecol.

One known mechanism involved with cancer cell resistance to Taxol is the high expression of the membrane P-glycoprotein that functions as a drug-efflux pump (4Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 385-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (3567) Google Scholar). Other mechanisms include the alterations of tubulin structure (5Panda D. Miller H.P. Banerjee A. Ludueña R.F. Wilson L. Proc.

However, the detailed molecular mechanisms that may contribute to Taxol resistance of cancer cells are still not fully understood.

Mature miRNA molecules are partially complementary to one or more messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules and translationally down-regulate gene expression (11Reinhart B.J. Slack F.J. Basson M.

Among hundreds of miRNAs, some have been shown to play a role in a variety of biological processes including proliferation, differentiation, migration, cell cycle, and apoptosis (14Kobayashi T. Lu J. Cobb B.S. Rodda S.J. McMahon A.P. Schipani E. Merkenschlager M. Kronenberg H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 1949-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 15Huang Q. Gumireddy K.

In recent years, some miRNAs have been reported to be involved in drug-resistance, acting as potential oncogenes or tumor suppressors (16Sorrentino A. Liu C.G. Addario A. Peschle C. Scambia G.

The “knockdown” and inhibition of miR-221 or miR-222 expression has been shown to sensitize MDA-MB-468 cells to tamoxifen-induced cell growth arrest and apoptosis (17Zhao J.J. Lin J. Yang H. Kong W.

We aimed to examine the role of miRNAs in Taxol resistance in breast cancer cells through the screening of differentially expressed miRNAs between Taxol-resistant and Taxol-sensitive cancer cells. We found that miR-125b is up-regulated in Taxol-resistant cancer cells, with its overexpression inhibiting Taxol-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis, subsequently increasing the resistance of cancer cells to Taxol. Moreover, we demonstrate that Bak1 is a direct target of miR-125b in breast cancer cells. Restoring the expression of Bak1 recovered Taxol sensitivity in counteracting miR-125b-mediated Taxol resistance. Taken together, miR-125b plays a critical role in Taxol resistance through suppression of Bak1 expression, and it may serve as a potential target for overcoming Taxol resistance in human breast cancer. Human breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-435 (MDA-435), MDA-MB-231 (MDA-231), MDA-MB-436 (MDA-436), MCF7, SKBr3, and BT474 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Taxol-resistant 435TR1 (single clone) and 435TRP (pooled clones) cells were developed from MDA-435 cells by treatment with gradually increasing concentrations of Taxol in cell culture medium. Cell viability assay showed that 435TR1 and 435TRP cells could tolerate much higher concentrations of Taxol compared with MDA-435 cells, with their IC50 concentrations found to be more than 30-fold higher than those of parental MDA-435 cells (19Zhou M. Zhao Y. Ding Y. Liu H. Liu Z. Fodstad O. Riker A.I. Kamarajugadda S. Lu J. Owen L.B. Ledoux S.P. Tan M. Mol. Cancer. 2010; 9: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Two more Taxol-resistant cell variants, 436TRP and SKBr3-TRP (both are pooled clones), were developed from MDA-436 and SKBr3 cell lines, respectively, using the same methods as for 435TRP. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Mediatech, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Total RNA was extracted from MDA-435, 435TR1, and 435TRP cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and the total RNA was labeled with Hy3 and Hy5 fluorescent dyes. Pairs of labeled samples were hybridized to miRCURY LNATM microRNA array slides with coverage of 428 unique human microRNAs (Exiqon, 208201-A) by using miRCURY LNATM Power labeling kit and miRCURY LNATM microRNA array kit (Exiqon) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A miRNA detection signal threshold was defined as twice the maximum background signal. Normalization was done using a cyclic LOWESS (locally weighted regression) method to remove the system-related variations. Data adjustments included data filtering, log2 transformation, and gene centering and normalization. Student's t test analysis was conducted between MDA-435 and 435TR1 and MDA-435 and 435TRP samples, and miRNAs with p values < 0.05 were selected for cluster analysis. The clustering analysis was done using a hierarchical method and average linkage and Euclidean distance metrics. miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) and miRNAs antisense RNAs (anti-miRNAs) were purchased from Applied Biosystems. Pre-miR-negative and anti-miR-negative were used as negative controls. Oligofectamine transfection reagent or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for the transfection of pre-miRNAs or anti-miRNAs. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the expression of miR-125b was detected by real-time PCR, and the expression of Bak1, a target of miR-125b, was tested by real-time PCR and/or Western blotting. Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). For miRNA expression analysis, qRT-PCR was done by using the TaqMan® microRNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) and TaqMan® microRNA assays kit (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's protocols. RNU6B served as an internal control. End-point PCR was performed to analyze the expression of miR-125b by using a mirVana qRT-PCR miRNA detection kit and mirVana qRT-PCR Primer Sets (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Human U6 served as an internal control. For the expression of Bak1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, cDNAs were synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using Cloned AMV First-Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). For quantitative PCR, cDNA was mixed with 2× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and various sets of gene-specific primers and then subjected to RT-PCR quantification by using the iQ5 real time PCR system (Bio-Rad). The sequences of the primers used were as follows: Bak1, 5′ primer (5′-GCTCCCAACCCATTCACTAC-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-TCCCTACTCCTTTTCCCTGA-3′); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′ primer (5′-ATCCCATCACCATCTTCCAG-3′) and 3′ primer (5′-ATGAGTCCTTCCACGATACC-3′). For semiquantitative PCR, the cDNA was mixed with PCR SuperMix (Invitrogen) and gene-specific primers. The PCR conditions were 25–30 cycles at 95 °C for 30s, 56 °C for 30s, and 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel. All reactions were performed in triplicate. The relative amounts of mRNA were calculated by using the comparative CT method. The results are presented as –fold change of each miRNA or mRNA in the 435TR1 and 435TRP cells relative to the parental MDA-435 cells. siRNA oligonucleotides for Bak1 were purchased from Sigma, with a scrambled siRNA (Sigma) used as a control. Transfection was performed using the Oligofectamine Transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cell lysates were prepared for further analysis by Western blotting. MDA-435 cells were transfected with 100 nm pre-miR-125b or pre-miR-negative. After 12 h, cells were treated with actinomycin (5 μg/ml). The stability of endogenous Bak1 mRNA was examined with real-time RT-PCR by measuring Bak1 mRNA levels at the indicated time. MDA-435 cells were transfected with 100 nm pre-miR-125b or pre-miR-negative and seeded into 96-well plates at 8 × 103 cells per well in triplicates. After 8 h, cells were treated with or without 20 nm Taxol for 24 h. Caspase 3 activity was measured by Caspase-Glo® 3/7 assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were transfected with 100 nm miR-125b precursor (pre-miR-125b), 100 nm pre-miR-125b in combination with 100 nm miR-125b inhibitor (anti-miR-125b), or 4 μg of Bak1-expressing vector, respectively, and 24 h after transfection the cells were followed with the indicated concentrations of Taxol treatment for 48 h and then were subjected to an apoptosis assay. Apoptosis was determined by annexin V/propidium iodide staining with the apoptosis detection kit (BD Pharmingen). Briefly, 1 × 105 treated cells were incubated with annexin V/propidium iodide for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry using two-color fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (BD LSR II). The pMIR-reporter luciferase vector containing the 3′-UTR of Bak1 and the empty vector were generous gifts from Dr. deVere White (20Shi X.B. Xue L. Yang J. Ma A.H. Zhao J. Xu M. Tepper C.G.

For the luciferase assay, cells at the density of 1.2 × 105 per well in 24-well plates were cotransfected with pMIR-REPORT luciferase reporters with or without 3′-UTR of Bak1, pre-miR-125b, or pre-miR-negative using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Twenty-four hours later, cells were harvested and lysed with passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured by using a dual luciferase reporter assay (Promega). The pRL-TK vector (Promega) was used as an internal control. The results were expressed as relative luciferase activity (firefly Luc/Renilla Luc). Cells were harvested and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 20 min on ice. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The proteins were then separated with a SDS/polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking in phosphate-buffered saline with 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4–8 °C with the primary antibodies in phosphate-buffered saline with 5% nonfat dry milk. The following antibodies were utilized: anti-Bak1 monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling), anti-cleaved PARP monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling), and anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (1:2000, Sigma). Membranes were extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-mouse antibody or anti-rabbit antibody (dilution 1:2000, Bio-Rad). After additional washes with phosphate-buffered saline, antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). A total of 5 × 103∼1 × 104 cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates. Twenty-four hours later, the medium was replaced with fresh medium with or without Taxol and incubated for 48 h. Cell viability was determined using CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega) as previously reported (21Zhao Y.H. Zhou M. Liu H. Ding Y. Khong H.T. Yu D. Fodstad O. Tan M. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 3689-3701Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Statistical evaluation for data analysis was determined by unpaired Student's t test. All data were shown as the means ± S.E.. A statistical difference of p < 0.05 was considered significant. To search for the critical miRNAs involved in Taxol resistance, the total RNA extracted from Taxol-resistant 435TR1 and 435TRP cells and their Taxol-sensitive parental MDA-435 cells were hybridized with miRNA array chips. Eight miRNAs were up-regulated in Taxol-resistant cells by more than 1.5-fold, and 13 miRNAs were down-regulated in Taxol-resistant cells by more than 1.5-fold (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table S1). Notably, the profiling results are correlative with the reported functions of miRNAs. For example, miRNAs with oncogenic function, such as miR-100 (22Henson B.J. Bhattacharjee S. O'Dee D.M.

Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 1279-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), were down-regulated in Taxol-resistant cells. To further validate the miRNA array results, we randomly selected four miRNAs, miR-923, miR-125b, miR-221m, and miR-222, from the up-regulated miRNAs and measured their expression levels by real-time PCR. The results of real-time PCR for all of the four selected miRNAs were consistent with the miRNA array results (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we examined the expression of miR-125b in two more Taxol-resistant cancer cell variants, 436TRP and SKBr3-TRP, that were derived from MD-MB-436 and SKBr3 breast cancer cell lines, respectively. More than 2-fold higher expression of miR-125b was found in Taxol-resistant 436TRP and SKBr3-TRP cells compared with their parental MDA-436 and SKBr3 cells, respectively (Fig. 1C), indicating that the correlation between miR-125b and Taxol resistance is not a single cell line-specific effect. These results suggested that the differential expression profiles screened by the miRNA array are reliable, and some of them may play a role in Taxol resistance. We investigated the role of miR-221, miR-222, and miR-125b in Taxol-induced cytotoxicity. Compared with negative control, overexpression of miR-221 and miR-125b markedly inhibited Taxol-induced cell cytotoxicity in MDA-435 cells (Fig. 2A). Because miR-125b showed a stronger inhibition to Taxol-induced cytotoxicity, we first focused on miR-125b and further investigated its role and mechanism in Taxol resistance. To confirm and extend our findings, two more breast cancer cell lines, MDA-231 and BT474, were used to investigate the effect of overexpression of miR-125b on Taxol resistance. Overexpression of miR-125b markedly inhibited Taxol-induced cytotoxicity in all of the cell lines tested (Fig. 2B). Moreover, overexpression of miR-125b dramatically decreased Taxol-induced cytotoxicity and increased Taxol resistance in a miR-125b dose-dependent manner in MDA-435 cells (Fig. 2C, top). Furthermore, the expression of miR-125b (Fig. 2C, bottom inset) decreased Taxol-induced cytotoxicity and increased Taxol resistance under various concentrations of Taxol treatment in MDA435 cells (Fig. 2C, bottom). Similar experiments were performed in MDA-231 cells with similar results obtained (Fig. 2D). Although overexpression of miR-125b confers Taxol resistance to cells, we asked whether down-regulation of miR-125b may increase Taxol sensitivity. miR-125b antisense (anti-miR-125b) was expressed in Taxol-resistant 435TR1 cells followed by treatment with increasing concentrations of Taxol for 48 h. We found that the knockdown of miR-125b by anti-miR-125b increased Taxol-induced cytotoxicity in these cells known to be highly resistant to Taxol (supplemental Fig. S1). These results clearly demonstrate that miR-125b plays an important role in Taxol resistance in breast cancer cells. Taxol is known to exert its cancer cell killing effect through induction of apoptosis (36Ofir R. Seidman R. Rabinski T. Krup M. Yavelsky V. Weinstein Y. Wolfson M. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 636-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Next, we examined whether overexpression of miR-125b was capable of inhibiting Taxol-induced apoptosis. MDA-435 cells were transfected with pre-miR-negative or pre-miR-125b and then treated with increasing concentrations of Taxol. Cell morphological change was observed with a microscope, showing markedly less cellular debris and non-viable cells in miR-125b-transfected cells compared with negative controls (Fig. 3A). Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) is an important marker of apoptosis, and it is cleaved downstream of caspases when cellular apoptosis happens (37Wu W. Hodges E. Höög C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: e13Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 38Boulares A.H. Yakovlev A.G. Ivanova V. Stoica B.A. Wang G. Iyer S. Smulson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22932-22940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). We next detected the protein levels of the cleaved PARP and total PARP by Western blotting in pre-miR-125b transfected MDA-435 and control cells after Taxol treatment. Compared with the negative control, the protein level of cleaved PARP was dramatically reduced in pre-miR-125b-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). The activity of caspase 3 was further detected using the Caspase-Glo® 3/7 assay system in pre-miR-125b-transfected MDA-435 cells after Taxol treatment for 24 h. Lower caspase 3 activity was found in miR-125b-transfected cells compared with the control cells (Fig. 3C). Moreover, apoptosis assays with annexin V staining revealed that significantly less apoptotic cells were detected in pre-miR-125b-transfected MDA-435 and MDA-231 cells compared with negative controls (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous miR-125b enhanced Taxol-induced apoptosis in Taxol-resistant 435TRP cells (supplemental Fig. S2). These results indicated that miR-125b confers Taxol resistance in cancer cells by blocking Taxol-induced apoptosis. Because miR-125b is capable of suppressing Taxol-induced apoptosis and increasing the resistance of cancer cells to Taxol, we searched miRNA databases for potential miR-125b targets that may possibly contribute to Taxol resistance. The three public miRNA databases (TargetScan, Pictar, and MicroRNA) all predicted that Bak1 might be a target for miR-125b, and the 3′-UTR of Bak1 contains a highly conserved binding site from position 629 to 635 for miR-125b (supplemental Fig. S3). To determine whether miR-125b could target Bak1 in breast cancer cells, we transfected the pre-miR-125b into MDA-435, MDA-231, MCF7, and SKBr3 cells. The expression of miR-125b significantly down-regulated Bak1 protein in a dose-dependent manner in all tested cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Moreover, knockdown of miR-125b up-regulated the expression of Bak1 in both MDA-231 and 435TRP cells with high expression of endogenous miR-125b (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrate that Bak1 is a target of miR-125b in breast cancer cells. We, therefore, investigated whether miR-125b directly targets the 3′-UTR of Bak1 mRNA, and we performed luciferase reporter analysis by co-transfecting a vector containing pMIR reporter-luciferase fused with or without the 3′-UTR of Bak1 mRNA and pre-miR-125b or pre-miR-negative. Overexpression of miR-125b decreased the luciferase activity of the reporter with 3′-UTR of Bak1 by about 60% in both MDA-435 and MDA-231 cells (Fig. 4D, left). However, no inhibitory effect of miR-125b on the activity of the reporter without 3′-UTR of Bak1 was detected (Fig. 4D, right), indicating that Bak1 mRNA is a direct target of miR-125b. miR-125b was examined for its capacity to suppress the expression of Bak1 at the mRNA level. Quantitative PCR was performed to detect Bak1 mRNA expression in MDA-435 and MDA-231 cells after transfection with pre-miR-125b or pre-miR-negative. We found that miR-125b decreased the expression of Bak1 mRNA with a similar inhibitory efficiency to the Bak1-specific siRNA in both cell lines, indicating that miR-125b inhibits the expression level of Bak1 mRNA (Fig. 4E). To explore the possibility that miR-125b decreases the stability of Bak1 mRNA, MDA-435 cells were tran"

Here, we provide evidence for a function of the two-component signaling system in cold stress response in Arabidopsis. Cold significantly induced the expression of a subset of A-type ARR genes and of GUS in ProARR7:GUS transgenic Arabidopsis. AHK2 and AHK3 were found to be primarily involved in mediating cold to express A-type ARRs despite cytokinin deficiency. Cold neither significantly induced AHK2 and AHK3 expression nor altered the cytokinin contents of wild type within the 4 h during which the A-type ARR genes exhibited peak expression in response to cold, indicating that cold might induce ARR expression via the AHK2 and AHK3 proteins without alterations in cytokinin levels. The ahk2 ahk3 and ahk3 ahk4 mutants exhibited enhanced freezing tolerance compared with wild type. These ahk double mutants acclimated as efficiently to cold as did wild type. The overexpression of the cold-inducible ARR7 in Arabidopsis resulted in a hypersensitivity response to freezing temperatures under cold-acclimated conditions. The expression of C-repeat/dehydration-responsive element target genes was not affected by ARR7 overexpression as well as in ahk double mutants. By contrast, the arr7 mutants showed increased freezing tolerance. The ahk2 ahk3 and arr7 mutants showed hypersensitive response to abscisic acid (ABA) for germination, whereas ARR7 overexpression lines exhibited insensitive response to ABA. These results suggest that AHK2 and AHK3 and the cold-inducible A-type ARRs play a negative regulatory role in cold stress signaling via inhibition of ABA response, occurring independently of the cold acclimation pathway.

Cytokinins are plant hormones that regulate a variety of developmental and physiological processes, including cell division, cell proliferation, root and leaf differentiation, chloroplast biogenesis, and the inhibition of leaf senescence (1.Davies P.J.

A hybrid-type histidine kinase referred to as CYTOKININ INDEPENDENT1 (CKI1) is essential for megagametogenesis (3.Pischke M.S. Jones L.G. Otsuga D. Fernandez D.E. Drews G.N. Sussman M.R. Proc. Natl.

CYTOKININ RESPONSE1 (CRE1)/WOODEN LEG1 (WOL1)/ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE KINASE4 (AHK4) were shown to bind directly to a variety of natural and synthetic cytokinins in vitro with high specificity as well as in a yeast system and thus to be a primary receptor for cytokinins (4.Inoue T.

The experiments conducted using a heterologous phospho-relay system demonstrated that AHK2 and AHK3 are also cytokinin receptors. The primary functions of these Arabidopsis histidine kinase (AHK) genes involve the triggering of cell division and the maintenance of the meristematic competence of cells to prevent subsequent differentiation (9.Higuchi M. Pischke M.S. Mähönen A.P. Miyawaki K. Hashimoto Y. Seki M. Kobayashi M. Shinozaki K. Kato T. Tabata S. Helariutta Y. Sussman M.R. Kakimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Partially redundant functions of cytokinin receptors have also been revealed in shoot growth, root development, leaf senescence, seed size, germination, and cytokinin metabolism (11.Riefler M. Novak O. Strnad M. Schmülling T. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 40-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). The AHK2 and AHK3 receptors play prominent roles in the control of leaf development, whereas AHK4 functions in the roots (10.Nishimura C. Ohashi Y. Sato S. Kato T. Tabata S. Ueguchi C. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1365-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). AHK3 is also involved in the cytokinin-mediated control of leaf longevity (12.Kim H.J. Ryu H. Hong S.H. Woo H.R. Lim P.O.

AHK1 has been shown to function as an osmosensor in yeasts in a cytokinin-independent manner (13.Urao T. Yakubov B. Satoh R. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Seki M. Hirayama T. Shinozaki K. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 1743-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), and it has recently been demonstrated to be a positive regulator of drought and salt stress response and ABA signaling (14.Tran L.S. Urao T. Qin F. Maruyama K. Kakimoto T. Shinozaki K. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20623-20628Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). AHK5 (CKI2) has histidine kinase activity independent of cytokinins and functions as a negative regulator for root elongation via an ETR1-dependent ABA and ethylene signaling pathway (15.Iwama A.

AHK5 was found to integrate endogenous and environmental signals that generate H2O2 in guard cells (16.Desikan R. Horák J. Chaban C. Mira-Rodado V. Witthöft J. Elgass K. Grefen C. Cheung M.K.

The Arabidopsis genome harbors six genes encoding histidine phosphotransfer proteins (AHPs) that mediate the transfer of the phosphoryl group from the histidine protein kinases to the response regulators (18.Hwang I. Chen H.C. Sheen J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 500-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Most of the Arabidopsis histidine phosphotransfer proteins act as redundant, positive regulators of cytokinin signaling, except for AHP4 and AHP6, and affect many aspects of plant development (19.Hutchison C.E.

Science. 2006; 311: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). There are 32 genes encoding 23 putative response regulators and 9 pseudo-response regulators in Arabidopsis. The typical response regulators are classified into either type A or B (18.Hwang I. Chen H.C. Sheen J. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 500-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 21.Lohrmann J. Harter K. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 363-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The type B Arabidopsis response regulators (ARRs) are transcription factors that contain a receiver domain and a large C-terminal region harboring a Myb-like DNA-binding domain and a glutamine-rich domain and are not cytokinin-inducible. The middle segments of ARR1 and ARR2, the B-type ARRs, can bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner in vitro, and their C-terminal halves function as transactivation domains in plant cells (22.Sakai H. Aoyama T. Oka A. Plant J. 2000; 24: 703-711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ARR1, ARR2, and ARR10 have been demonstrated to function as transcriptional activators for the ARR6 promoter in Arabidopsis mesophyll cell protoplasts (23.Hwang I. Sheen J. Nature. 2001; 413: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Type B ARRs function as positive regulators of cytokinin signaling and also play a role in plant development (24.Argyros R.D. Mathews D.E. Chiang Y.H. Palmer C.M. Thibault D.M. Etheridge N. Argyros D.A. Mason M.G. Kieber J.J. Schaller G.E.

Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 3007-3018Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). By contrast, the typical type A ARRs are composed of a receiver domain and a divergent C-terminal extension. The mRNAs of A-type ARRs accumulate rapidly and transiently after cytokinin treatment. The A-type ARRs function as transcriptional repressors in Arabidopsis protoplasts (23.Hwang I. Sheen J. Nature. 2001; 413: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). In transgenic Arabidopsis, ARR8 or ARR15 overexpression resulted in reduced cytokinin sensitivity, whereas ARR4 overexpression induced increased sensitivity to exogenous cytokinins (26.Kiba T. Yamada H. Sato S. Kato T. Tabata S. Yamashino T. Mizuno T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2003; 44: 868-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 27.Osakabe Y. Miyata S. Urao T. Seki M. Shinozaki K. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 806-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The majority of A-type ARRs are partially redundant negative regulators of cytokinin signaling (28.To J.P. Haberer G. Ferreira F.J. Deruère J. Mason M.G. Schaller G.E. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Kieber J.J. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 658-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The genome-wide expression profiling analysis of cytokinin response in the ARR7 overexpressor compared with the wild type demonstrated that ARR7 acts principally as a transcriptional repressor of a variety of early cytokinin-regulated genes encoding transcription factors, signal transmitters, plant development, and cellular metabolism (29.Lee D.J.

The Asp-85 mutation of ARR7 into the Asp residue blocked the phosphorylation of ARR7 by the Arabidopsis protein extracts in vitro and abolished the ability of ARR7 to suppress cytokinin-mediated responses in transgenic Arabidopsis (30.Lee D.J. Kim S. Ha Y.M. Kim J. Planta. 2008; 227: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting that the phosphorylation of ARR7 is essential to its function as a negative regulator of cytokinin signaling in Arabidopsis. Recent studies have shown that AHK1 is a positive regulator of drought and salt stress responses, as well as ABA signaling (14.Tran L.S. Urao T. Qin F. Maruyama K. Kakimoto T. Shinozaki K. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20623-20628Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), and is involved in water stress response during the early vegetative stages of plant growth, but it also performs a unique role in the regulation of desiccation processes during seed maturation (31.Wohlbach D.J. Quirino B.F. Sussman M.R. Plant Cell. 2008; 20: 1101-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). AHK2, AHK3, and CRE1 have all been implicated as negative regulators in ABA signaling and osmotic stress responses (14.Tran L.S. Urao T. Qin F. Maruyama K. Kakimoto T. Shinozaki K. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20623-20628Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Cold temperatures exert adverse effects on plant growth and development and limit the geographic distribution of plants. Plants respond and adapt to cold via alterations in various aspects of physiological processes, including gene expression (32.Shinozaki K. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Seki M. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2003; 6: 410-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar, 33.Thomashow M.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 571-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2571) Google Scholar). Abiotic stresses, including cold, induce a number of genes that encode the proteins that promote stress tolerance, mediated primarily by an ABA-dependent and/or ABA-independent pathway. Cold temperatures transcriptionally activate C-REPEAT-BINDING FACTOR/DRE-BINDING FACTORs (CBF/DREBs) that bind to the C-repeat/dehydration-responsive element in the ABA-independent pathway, inducing the expression of cold-responsive genes. Genetic and reverse genetic approaches have revealed a number of components that are involved in the cold signaling pathway (32.Shinozaki K. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Seki M. Curr. Opin.

In this study, we analyzed ahk and A-type arr Arabidopsis mutants as well as ARR7-overexpressing lines under freezing temperatures and A-type ARR expression in response to cold, and we demonstrated that the TCS, which is known best as a mediator of cytokinin signal transduction, is employed as a negative regulator in the process of adaptation to cold temperatures in plants. We found that the cold-inducible expression of A-type ARR genes was severely reduced by ahk2 and ahk3 double mutations. Analyses of A-type ARR expression in ahk mutants and in cytokinin-deficient or -overproducing transgenic Arabidopsis indicate that AHK2 and AHK3 might be involved in mediating cold to express A-type ARRs independently of the influence of endogenous cytokinin levels. Moreover, the cytokinin contents were not altered significantly by cold treatment within the 4 h during which the peak expression of cold-inducible ARRs occurs. Cold did not significantly induce AHK2 and AHK3 expression, indicating that the AHK2 and AHK3 proteins may mediate cold temperatures for A-type ARR expression. The ahk2, ahk3, and cre1 (ahk4) single mutants displayed tolerance to freezing temperatures when preincubated with cytokinin prior to freezing, as compared with the wild-type plants treated with cytokinin, as well as the untreated ahk single mutants. The ahk2 ahk3 and ahk3 ahk4 double mutants exhibited enhanced freezing tolerance without cytokinin preincubation. The overexpression of the cold-inducible ARR7 in Arabidopsis caused a hypersensitivity response to freezing temperatures when cold-acclimated, whereas the arr7 mutants exhibited increased freezing tolerance prior to and after cold acclimation. The expression of CBF/DREB target genes was not affected by ARR7 overexpression as well as in ahk double mutants. In both root elongation and germination assays, ahk2 ahk3 showed hypersensitivity response to ABA. arr7 showed hypersensitive response to ABA for germination, whereas Pro35S:ARR7 lines exhibited insensitive response to ABA. These results suggest that a normal function of a part of cytokinin TCS might be to negatively regulate the cold stress adaptation response through inhibition of ABA response, independently of the CBF/DREB pathway. Our results reveal a new versatile function of the plant two-component signaling system in cold stress response. The promoter region of ARR7 encompassing −1651 bp relative to the AUG initiation codon was isolated by PCR from the genomic DNA of Arabidopsis Col-0 and subcloned into pBI121 (Clontech) in place of the CaMV 35S promoter, and transgenic Arabidopsis containing this construct (ProARR7:GUS) was made by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (37.Bechtold N.

For treatment with cytokinin benzyladenine (BA), the seedlings were grown on sterile filter papers on MS agar plates and then immersed in MS medium containing 5 μm BA. For the freezing tolerance assays, the plants were germinated on MS agar plates, grown for the indicated periods, and then treated with freezing temperatures in a temperature-controlled chamber. For the DEX treatments, the plants were grown on sterile filter paper on MS plates for 10 days and then transferred to MS plates containing 10 μm DEX. The plants were then incubated for a given period. Freezing-induced electrolyte leakage (41.Ishitani M. Xiong L. Lee H. Stevenson B. Zhu J.K.

The percentage of electrolyte leakage was calculated as the percentage of the conductivity prior to autoclaving over that noted after autoclaving the leaflets. At least 8–10 assays were conducted for each sample.

Wilson K.J. Plant Mol. Biol. Manual B. 1991; 14: 1-33Google Scholar). The procedure utilized for cytokinin purification herein was a modified version of the method described previously (43.Faiss M. Zalubìlová J. Strnad M. Schmülling T. Plant J. 1997; 12: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Deuterium-labeled cytokinin internal standards (Olchemim Ltd., Czech Republic) were added, each at 1 pmol per sample, to assess the recovery during purification and to validate the determination (44.Novák O. Hauserová E. Amakorová P. Dolezal K. Strnad M. Phytochemistry. 2008; 69: 2214-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The samples were purified with a combined cation (SCX cartridge) and anion (DEAE-Sephadex C18 cartridge) exchanger and immunoaffinity chromatography based on wide range-specific monoclonal antibodies against cytokinins (45.Novák O. Tarkowski P. Lenobel R. Dolezal K. Strnad M. Anal. Chim. Acta. 2003; 480: 207-218Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The metabolic eluates from the immunoaffinity chromatography columns were evaporated to dryness and dissolved in 20 μl of the mobile phase utilized for quantitative analysis. The samples were analyzed by an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (Acquity UPLCTM; Waters, Milford, MA) coupled to a Quatro microTM atmospheric pressure ionization (Waters, Milford, MA) triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray interface. The purified samples were then injected into a C18 reversed-phase column (BEH C18; 1.7 μm; 2.1 × 50 mm; Waters). The column was eluted with a linear gradient (0 min, 10% B; 0–8 min, 50% B; flow-rate of 0.25 ml/min; column temperature of 40 °C) of 15 mm ammonium formate, pH 4.0 (solvent A), and methanol (solvent B). Quantification was conducted by the multiple reaction monitoring of [M + H]+ and the appropriate product ion. For the selective multiple reaction monitoring experiments, the optimal conditions, dwell time, cone voltage, and collision energy in the collision cell corresponding to exact diagnostic transition were optimized for each cytokinin (44.Novák O. Hauserová E. Amakorová P. Dolezal K. Strnad M. Phytochemistry. 2008; 69: 2214-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Quantification was conducted using Masslynx software using a standard isotope dilution method. The ratio of endogenous cytokinin to the appropriate labeled standard was determined and further used to quantify the level of endogenous compounds in the original extract, according to a known quantity of an added internal standard (45.Novák O. Tarkowski P. Lenobel R. Dolezal K. Strnad M. Anal. Chim. Acta. 2003; 480: 207-218Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Following treatment, the Arabidopsis plants were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Total RNA was isolated from frozen Arabidopsis samples using TRI Reagent® (Molecular Research Center, Inc.). Total RNA was separated on 1.2% agarose gel, transferred to nylon membranes, hybridized with 32P-labeled DNA probes at 68 °C for 3 h using 10 ml of QuikHyb solution (Stratagene), and then washed. The blot was subsequently exposed to x-ray film. For RT-PCR analysis, total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen) and subjected to RT-PCR analysis with an Access RT-PCR System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR conditions and primer sequences are provided in supplemental Table 1. Real time RT-PCR was conducted using a QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen) in a Rotor-Gene 2000 real time thermal cycling system (Corbett Research). PCR conditions and primers are available upon request. To determine the copy numbers of the transcripts in the treated samples, real time PCR was conducted for each sample with a known quantity of the in vitro transcribed RNA (Promega), yielding specific threshold values (Ct). A standard curve was generated to show the linear correlation between the log (copy numbers of the RNA) and the Ct. The copy numbers of the transcripts of unknown samples subjected to real time RT-PCR were then calculated from this standard curve. Real time RT-PCR conditions and primer sequences are provided in supplemental Table 1. Many of the upstream components of signaling pathways are expressed quickly and primarily in response to stimuli (46.Abel S. Theologis A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 47.Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). We previously isolated ARR7, a cytokinin-inducible A-type ARR gene (48.D'Agostino I.B. Deruère J. Kieber J.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1706-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar), as an immediate response mRNA from Arabidopsis by cold temperature at 1 °C using differential display PCR. 3M.-O. Oh and J. Kim, unpublished observations. We thus investigated the ARR7 gene as a starting point to understand the potential cross-talk occurring between cold response and cytokinin signaling and the role of TCS in cold response. We initially performed a time course analysis of the expression of ARR7 mRNA in response to cold via RNA-gel blot analysis (Fig. 1A). The ARR7 mRNA began to accumulate within 10 min at 1 °C, reached a peak level at 2–4 h, and then declined, displaying an early and transient expression pattern similar to that observed with cytokinin-mediated ARR7 expression. ARR7 also responds to other abiotic stresses, such as drought (Fig. 1B) or significantly high salinity (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 2), but only slightly and in a transient manner, with an earlier peak. In this study, we have focused on the role of TCS in cold response. To determine whether ARR7 expression is modulated at the transcriptional level in response to cold as well as cytokinins, we fused the 1.65-kbp promoter region of the ARR7 gene to GUS and generated six transgenic Arabidopsis lines harboring the corresponding construct (ProARR7:GUS). We conducted histochemical GUS assays to assess the patterns of tissue expression. As shown in supplemental Fig. 3, A–G, we detected strong GUS expression in the meristem regions of the flowers, shoots, and roots (supplemental Fig. 3, A–C). The vascular tissues of the leaves and roots displayed strong GUS staining (supplemental Fig. 3, D, E, and G). The valves of the silique (supplemental Fig. 3F) and the pistil tip (supplemental Fig. 3A) were also strongly stained with GUS. Increasing concentrations of cytokinin benzyladenine (BA) enhanced GUS staining throughout the whole leaves (Fig. 1, D–F) and the GUS mRNA level, as demonstrated by RNA-gel blot analysis (Fig. 1G). Cold temperature significantly enhanced GUS expression (Fig. 1, H and I). The RNA-gel blot analysis also demonstrated that cold temperature transiently ind"

CD69 is a disulfide-linked dimer, and crystal structure analysis established the ectodomain has a C-type lectin fold, though whether it retained a sugar-binding site was unclear (10.Natarajan K.

In contrast to other members of the NK C-type lectin cluster, CD69 has not been established to have a role in NK cell recognition of target cells. In transgenic overexpression studies, CD69 inhibited T cell egress from the thymus (12.Feng C. Woodside K.J. Vance B.A. El-Khoury D. Canelles M. Lee J. Gress R. Fowlkes B.J. Shores E.W. Love P.E.

Lanier L.L. Cyster J.G. Matloubian M. Nature. 2006; 440: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). When CD69 was overexpressed in cells, it caused down-modulation of S1P1 (4.Shiow L.R. Rosen D.B. Brdicková N. Xu Y. An J. Lanier L.L. Cyster J.G. Matloubian M. Nature. 2006; 440: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Reciprocally, when cells lacked expression of S1P1 because of targeted gene deletion, CD69 was detected on the cell surface (1.Matloubian M. Lo C.G. Cinamon G. Lesneski M.J. Xu Y. Brinkmann V. Allende M.L. Proia R.L. Cyster J.G. Nature. 2004; 427: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar). These data suggested that the presence of S1P1 keeps the low amounts of CD69 produced in naïve T cells from reaching the cell surface. Further evidence that S1P1 can antagonize CD69 expression came from the identification of S1P1 in a genetic screen for molecules that suppress surface CD69 expression in Jurkat T cells (14.Chu P. Pardo J. Zhao H. Li C.C. Pali E. Shen M.M. Qu K. Yu S.X. Huang B.C. Yu P. Masuda E.S. Molineaux S.M. Kolbinger F. Aversa G. de Vries J. Payan D.G. Liao X.C. J. Biol. 2003; 2: 21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These combined observations have suggested that CD69 and S1P1 interact in a variety of lymphocyte cell types and that an overabundance of either molecule can suppress the expression of the other. Evidence for a biochemical interaction between these molecules came from co-immunoprecipitation experiments of epitope-tagged receptors, and from a reporter assay showing that cell surface cross-linking of S1P1 led to co-crosslinking of CD69 (4.Shiow L.R. Rosen D.B. Brdicková N. Xu Y. An J. Lanier L.L. Cyster J.G. Matloubian M. Nature. 2006; 440: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). However, the properties of this interaction have not been defined. Here we perform mutagenesis and domain swapping experiments to map regions of CD69 and S1P1 required for complex formation and receptor down-modulation. We use binding studies to show that the complex has an increased binding strength for S1P, and we show that S1P1 protein amounts are reduced in the presence of abundant CD69. Finally, we demonstrate that an S1P1 non-binding mutant of CD69 is ineffective in blocking T cell egress from lymph nodes. WEHI-231 cells maintained in RPMI complete (10% fetal bovine serum, supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, l-glutamine, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Cells were split before reaching confluence, but were used for co-IP experiments when the concentration of cells was over 106/ml and >95% viable. Construction of the MSCV2.2 retroviral vector expressing a Flag-tagged full-length mouse S1P1, upstream of a IRES and a cytoplasmic domain-truncated human CD4, has been described (15.Lo C.G. Xu Y. Proia R.L. Cyster J.G. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Full-length mouse S1P3 was also cloned into this vector. Mouse CD23, CD69, and human NKRp1A were cloned from splenic cDNA into MSCV2.2 upstream of an IRES and GFP reporter element. Chimeric constructs were produced by PCR with primers overlapping the junctions. All constructs were sequenced. The protein sequences of each mutant or chimeric construct are described in supplemental data. Cultures of Phoenix-E packaging cell line were transfected with these transfer vectors, and supernatants containing retrovirus were collected, and WEHI-231 cells were transduced as described. Immunoprecipitation was done as previously described (4.Shiow L.R. Rosen D.B. Brdicková N. Xu Y. An J. Lanier L.L. Cyster J.G. Matloubian M. Nature. 2006; 440: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell pellets were lysed in 0.875% Brij97, 0.125% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 0.02% NaN3 buffer containing protease inhibitors (Sigma). Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE, Invitrogen) and transferred to Immobilon-FL membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with LI-COR buffer and stained with rabbit anti-actin (Sigma), anti-Flag M1 (Sigma), anti-HA biotin 3F10 (Roche). Products were detected with goat-anti-mouse IRDye 680, IRDye 800CW (LI-COR Biosciences), or donkey-anti-rabbit IRDye 700DX (Rockland) and imaged on an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). Data were acquired on a FACSCalibur or LSRII (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed with FlowJo software (Treestar). Fluorochrome- or biotin-conjugated antibodies were from BD Pharmingen or eBioscience. Flag M2 bio (Sigma) was used for staining the S1P receptor-tagged cells. All constructs, except N6N-DS, N6N-stalk, and 69ISNKE, which were not recognized by any available antibodies, were tested for surface expression (supplemental Fig. S1). Labeled sphingosine d-erythro-1-phosphate [33P] (S1P, American radiolabeled chemicals) was resuspended in binding reaction buffer (20 mm Tris pH 7.4, 0.5% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin, 100 mm NaCl, 15 mm NaF, 2 mm 4-dexypyridoxine, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× protease inhibitor mixture). WEHI-231 cells were washed 2× with phosphate-buffered saline, and 2 × 105 cells were added to each binding reaction tube. The 33P-labeled S1P was added at a final concentration of 200 pm and allowed to bind on ice for 30′. Unlabeled S1P was then added at 2 μm, and the cells collected on 1.3 cm GF/F filters (Whatman) by vacuum filtration at the indicated times and immediately washed two times with 0.5 ml of binding buffer. The filters were collected into scintillation vials and 1 ml of Ecolume (MP Biomedicals) was added to each tube and mixed before reading on a LS6500 scintillation counter (Beckman). Chemotaxis was across bare 5-μm transwell filters (Corning Costar Corp.) over 3 h in response to S1P (Sigma) or SDF1α (Peprotech) as described (1.Matloubian M. Lo C.G. Cinamon G. Lesneski M.J. Xu Y. Brinkmann V. Allende M.L. Proia R.L. Cyster J.G. Nature. 2004; 427: 355-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar). Spleens from donor mice were mechanically dissociated on 70-μm nylon cell strainers. Cells were washed and resuspended at 5 × 106/ml, and 1 ml was added per well of a 24-well plate coated with anti-CD3 (3 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (0.5 μg/ml) antibody in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 3 h. Cells were activated for 24 h and then transduced by spinfection with fresh Phoenix E supernatant as described (16.Swift S. Lorens J. Achacoso P. Nolan G.P. Curr. Prot. Imm. 1999; : 10.17.14-10.17.29Google Scholar). Cells were then rested for 48 h, collected, and checked for transduction efficiency. Transduced cells were labeled with 5 μm CMTMR (Invitrogen) for 20′ at a 37 °C and washed 2× before combining. 5 × 107 cells were transferred per mouse and cells were analyzed at 24-h post-transfer. At that time, half of the recipients were treated i.v. with 100 μg of both anti-α4 and anti-αL antibody to block LN entry and analyzed 18 h post-injection. Structural models were generated by modeler (17.Eswar N. Marti-Renom M.A. Webb B. Madhusudhan M.S. Eramian D. Shen M. Pieper U. Sali A. Curr. Prot.

Henderson R. Leslie A.G. Tate C.G. Schertler G.F. Nature. 2008; 454: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Figures were generated with Pymol (19.DeLano W. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2006Google Scholar). To test whether immune-specific molecules were required for the CD69-S1P1 interaction we transduced 3T3 fibroblasts with retroviruses expressing HA-tagged CD69 or the related type II transmembrane protein, human NKRp1A, and Flag-tagged S1P1 or S1P3. Immunoprecipitation experiments with lysates from cotransduced cells revealed that S1P1 co-immunoprecipitated CD69 but not NKRp1A, whereas S1P3 co-immunoprecipitated little of either lectin molecule (Fig. 1). These results suggest a lack of immune-specific molecule requirement for the CD69-S1P1 interaction. To map the sites on CD69 involved in the interaction, we used a domain swapping approach in WEHI-231 B lymphoma cells with NKRp1A. A construct containing the transmembrane and intracellular domains of CD69 (69ITNKE) retained the ability to interact with S1P1, though with reduced efficiency compared with wild type (Fig. 2A) whereas the converse construct where CD69 regions were replaced with the NKRp1A sequence (NKIT69E) disrupted the interaction (Fig. 2A). All these constructs were expressed at similar levels on the surface of cells lacking FLAG-S1P1 as assessed by flow cytometry (supplemental Fig. S1). In the Western blot analysis for these HA-tagged constructs, the amount of CD69 and 69ITNKE was lower in the lysates from S1P1 than S1P3 expressing cells, perhaps because interaction with S1P1 promotes degradation of some of the complex (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the loss being due to complexing, NKIT69E was present in similar amounts in the S1P1- and S1P3-expressing cells (Fig. 2A). This correlation between interaction with S1P1 and reduction in the total HA-tagged construct detected in cell lysates was noted for many of the subsequently tested constructs. Selective transfer to NKRp1A of the CD69 transmembrane region alone (N6N) was insufficient to transfer the interaction (Fig. 2A), but inclusion of the membrane proximal intracellular sequence, HEGSI, (N6N-Δ31; Δ31 designating a six amino acid expansion of the minimal transmembrane domain achieved by beginning the CD69 sequence 31 amino acids from the N terminus) conferred an ability to interact with S1P1 (Fig. 2B). This may partly have reflected enhanced expression as the N6N construct showed poor surface expression compared with N6N-Δ31 (supplemental Fig. S1). However, analysis of constructs selectively lacking the HEGSI motif (described below) further suggested a role for this region in the interaction with S1P1. Unexpectedly, the N6N-Δ31 construct also interacted with S1P3 (Fig. 2B). On the extracellular side, inclusion of the membrane proximal stalk region (N6N-stalk) was not sufficient to confer an ability to interact (Fig. 2B). However, the stalk conferred interaction specificity when it was added to the construct containing the CD69 transmembrane and HEGSI motif (converting N6N-Δ31 to N6N-DS; Fig. 2B). The altered molecular weight of some constructs likely reflects altered glycosylation states of the chimeric proteins. Although constructs containing the CD69 ectodomain (NKIT69E) or the entire CD69 intracellular region (69INKTE) did not show interaction (Fig. 2A), when these domains were transferred into NKRp1A together (6N6 and 6N6-stalk) they conferred some ability to interact (Fig. 2, A and B). This might reflect a weak interaction conferred by both the ectodomain and intracellular domain that only achieves sufficient strength to be detectable in co-immunoprecipitation when both domains are present together. Further mapping of the CD69 stalk segment showed that the membrane proximal half was needed for conferring interaction specificity; when this region of CD69 was replaced with the corresponding region from hNKRp1A (69NKS1 and 69NKS12), the chimeric molecule now interacted with S1P3 as well as with S1P1 (Fig. 3A). By contrast, the membrane distal half did not affect interaction specificity (69NKS2, Fig. 3A). Further subdividing the membrane proximal half into two segments identified the most membrane proximal QKSSIEK sequence as conferring S1P receptor interaction specificity (69NKS1N, Fig. 3B). On the intracellular side, the conserved membrane proximal HEGSI motif was necessary for the wild-type interaction strength of construct NKD69TE (Fig. 4A). When starting from the wild-type CD69, deletion of this motif (HEGSI delete) or replacement by the corresponding PWHQFA motif of NKRp1A (HEGSI replace) led to reduced binding, while simply shifting the motif away from the membrane by inserting the NKRp1A sequence (PWHQFA insert) had little effect (Fig. 4B). Moreover, deletion of the HEGSI motif from the swap construct containing the CD69 ecto- and intracellular domains (6N6-stalk) in construct 6N6-DS led to a loss of binding (Fig. 2B). All of these constructs showed strong surface expression by flow cytometry (supplemental Fig. S1). Alanine scanning of this sequence did not identify a particular residue that was responsible for a significant portion of the binding (supplemental Fig. S2). These findings suggest CD69 has a multipartite interaction surface that includes the transmembrane, membrane proximal, and ectodomains and mediates a specific interaction with S1P1. Because CD69 is a member of the C-type lectin family, we initially tested the impact on complex formation of mutating the single surface-exposed consensus N-glycosylation (N30D) site (20.Kohno T. Wada A. Igarashi Y. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 983-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) as well as the tyrosine sulfation sites (Y-sulfo) of S1P1 (21.Fieger C.B. Huang M.C. Van Brocklyn J.R. Goetzl E.J. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1926-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Mutation of these sites or replacement of the entire N terminus with the corresponding region of S1P3 (S1P3 + 1) had little or no effect on S1P1 interaction with CD69 and the S1P1 N terminus alone was not sufficient to confer binding (S1P1 + 3) (Fig. 5A). We also determined that the human sequence of S1P1 was able to interact with CD69 normally (huS1P1). We next generated a series of swap mutants between S1P1 and S1P3. Exchanging all the intracellular loops of S1P3 with those in S1P1 (S1P31313) was not sufficient to confer binding (Fig. 5A).

In addition, S1P binding was not required for the formation of a S1P1-CD69 complex because the S1P non-binding construct R120A (24.Parrill A.L. Wang D. Bautista D.L. Van Brocklyn J.R. Lorincz Z.

Replacement of transmembrane helix 4 and associated membrane flanking loop regions of S1P1 by the corresponding region in S1P3 caused a marked reduction in CD69 binding in construct S1P13D (Fig. 6), an effect that was not seen following individual swapping of the other membrane helices and flanking regions (Fig. 6). All of the swap mutant constructs, with the exception of S1P13B, showed robust surface expression by flow cytometry (supplemental Fig. S1). Further mutagenesis revealed that transmembrane helix 4 (S1P13D2) is necessary for most of the interaction with CD69 when compared with the flanking intracellular and extracellular regions (S1P13D1 and S1P13D3, respectively) (Fig. 7A). Replacement of helix 4 in S1P3 with the corresponding region of S1P1 (S1P31D) was sufficient to confer an ability to interact with CD69 but not NKRp1A (Fig. 7B). Analogous with the CD69 HEGSI motif, no single position was responsible for a majority of the binding when each of the eight differences between the S1P1 transmembrane domains were mutated to the corresponding S1P3 residue (supplemental Fig. S3).FIGURE 7The S1P1 helix 4 is necessary and sufficient for most of the interaction with CD69. A, co-IP of S1P13D1–3 constructs where the intracellular loop (D1), minimal predicted transmembrane domain (D2), or extracellular loop (D3) of the S1P1D (membrane helix 4) construct have been swapped with the corresponding region of S1P3. B, co-IP of the S1P31D is the converse construct from the S1P13D with all regions from S1P3 except helix 4. Schematics showing helix 4 of the construct used designate the S1P1 regions of the construct with solid lines and filled rectangles, whereas the S1P3 regions are designated by dashed lines and unfilled rectangles. These data are representative of two experiments with similar results.

Rosen D.B. Brdicková N. Xu Y. An J. Lanier L.L. Cyster J.G. Matloubian M. Nature. 2006; 440: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). To test the fate of S1P1 that has complexed with CD69 we compared Flag-S1P1-expressing cells that had been transduced with intermediate (+) or high (++) amounts of CD69. In the CD69 intermediate samples, the cells fall mostly into two mutually exclusive populations: cells with surface Flag-S1P1 staining and little CD69, and cells with CD69 surface expression and no Flag-S1P1 (Fig. 8A, HA-CD69+). Examination of reporter gene expression in these exclusive populations shows that the Flag-S1P1 surface-negative cells have higher amounts of the CD69 reporter (GFP) than the Flag-S1P1 surface-positive cells, whereas both have similar amounts of the Flag-S1P1 reporter (hCD4) (Fig. 8A, histogram plots) in agreement with previous findings (4.Shiow L.R. Rosen D.B. Brdicková N. Xu Y. An J. Lanier L.L. Cyster J.G. Matloubian M. Nature. 2006; 440: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). In cells transduced to express very high amounts of CD69 (Fig. 8A, HA-CD692+) the surface exposure of Flag-S1P1 was almost completely suppressed. By contrast, in Flag-S1P3-expressing cells, the intensity of Flag and CD69 staining was minimally affected by the presence of even very high amounts of CD69. High expression of CD69 not only reduces surface S1P1 abundance but leads to a reduction in total S1P1 protein within the cell (Fig. 8B), suggesting the protein is targeted for degradation. By contrast, although S1P3 was less abundantly expressed, the total amount was unaffected by high CD69 expression (Fig. 8B). Previously we found that pertussis toxin treatment led to recovery of CD69 expression in S1P1 dominated cells, while not allowing recovery of S1P1 expression in CD69-dominated cells (4.Shiow L.R. Rosen D.B. Brdicková N. Xu Y. An J. Lanier L.L. Cyster J.G. Matloubian M. Nature. 2006; 440: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar), suggesting different requirements for down-modulation of the complex depending on which partner is more abundantly expressed. By mutating the ERY motif of S1P1 (to EAY or ENY), we found that an intact G-protein-coupling motif (25.Rovati G.E. Capra V. Neubig R.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 959-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) is needed for down-modulation of the complex, irrespective of whether CD69 or S1P1 is dominant (Fig. 9A). That is, rather than observing evidence for mutually exclusive surface expression of Flag-S1P1 and CD69 (as seen with wild-type S1P1 in Fig. 9A) the molecules were coexpressed on the cell surface (Fig. 9A, EAY and ENY). As expected, cells expressing NKRp1A as a control showed no evidence of Flag-S1P1 modulation (Fig. 9A, NKRp1A-stained plots). Despite the effect of the EAY and ENY mutations on modulation, these mutations did not disrupt the ability of CD69 and S1P1 to interact in the co-immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. 9B). Disruption of a desensitization motif in the C terminus of S1P1 by mutating 5 serines to alanines (S5A) (22.Oo M.L. Thangada S. Wu M.T. Liu C.H. Macdonald T.L. Lynch K.R. Lin C.Y. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9082-9089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) prevented S1P1 from mediating efficient down-modulation of CD69 without blocking CD69 down-modulation of S1P1 (Fig. 9C). That is, the cells expressing high amounts of mutant Flag-S1P1 were mostly co-expressing surface CD69 (Fig. 9C, S5A) in contrast to the suppression of CD69 expression on the cells expressing high amounts of wild-type Flag-S1P1 (Fig. 9C). This suggests a requirement for this serine-rich motif in S1P1-mediated modulation of CD69, but not in CD69-mediated modulation of S1P1. Deletion of the last 12 amino acids from the S1P1 C terminus, a region that contains further residues involved in ligand-mediated desensitization (23.Watterson K.R. Johnston E. Chalmers C. Pronin A. Cook S.J. Benovic J.L. Palmer T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5767-5777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) did not affect down-modulation of the CD69-S1P1 complex (Fig. 9C, Δ12). Notably, mutation of S1P1 residue Arg-120 to Ala, a mutation that disrupts S1P binding (24.Parrill A.L. Wang D. Bautista D.L. Van Brocklyn J.R. Lorincz Z. Fischer D.J. Baker D.L. Liliom K. Spiegel S. Tigyi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39379-39384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), prevented efficient down-modulation of the CD69-S1P1 complex (Fig. 9C, R120A). This suggests that acquisition of a ligand-bound conformation might be necessary for efficient modulation of the CD69-S1P1 complex, both in cells dominated by CD69 and in cells dominated by S1P1. To determine whether CD69 altered the ligand binding properties of S1P1, we used a radiolabeled ligand binding assay to test the half-life of S1P binding to S1P1 or the S1P1-CD69 complex in transduced WEHI-231 cells. Compared with WEHI-231 cells expressing S1P1 alone, the cells expressing both S1P1 and CD69 had about 10-fold lower amounts of surface S1P1 as detected by flow cytometry (supplemental Fig. S1). Unexpectedly, the co-transduced WEHI-231 cells bound 2-fold greater amounts of [33P]S1P than cells transduced with S1P1 alone, and the decay of cell-associated labeled-S1P when competed with an excess of unlabeled S1P was ∼10-fold slower (Fig. 10). Because the increased binding cannot be explained by an increased number of surface S1P1 receptors, these findings fit best with the interpretation that CD69 stabilizes a high affinity ligand binding conformation of S1P1. Previous work established that CD69 is necessary for inhibition of lymphocyte egress following IFNα/β exposure and correlated this requirement with the ability of CD69 to inhibit S1P1 function (4.Shiow L.R. Rosen D.B. Brdicková N. Xu Y. An J. Lanier L.L. Cyster J.G. Matloubian M. Nature. 2006; 440: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). To further test whether CD69 inhibition of egress depends on its ability to interact with and inhibit S1P1, we tested the activity of wild type and an S1P1 non-binding mutant of CD69 (6N6-Δ31, Fig. 2B) at inhibiting T cell migration to S1P and egress from lymph nodes (Fig. 11). Consistent with the inability to interact with S1P1, 6N6-Δ31 had no inhibitory activity on S1P1-mediated cell migration to S1P (Fig. 11A). The reciprocal construct, N6N-Δ31 that has some ability to interact with S1P1 (Fig. 2B) showed partial inhibition of migration (Fig. 11A). Interestingly, construct 6N6-stalk that contains the CD69 ectodomain and scores positive in the interact"

We have developed two nanoparticle formulations, cationic liposome-polycation-DNA (LPD) and anionic liposome-polycation-DNA (LPD-II), for systemic co-delivery of doxorubicin (Dox) and a therapeutic small interfering RNA (siRNA) to multiple drug resistance (MDR) tumors. In this study, we have provided four strategies to overcome drug resistance. First, we formed the LPD nanoparticles with a guanidinium-containing cationic lipid, i.e. N,N-distearyl-N-methyl-N-2-(N′-arginyl) aminoethyl ammonium chloride, which can induce reactive oxygen species, down-regulate MDR transporter expression, and increase Dox uptake. Second, to block angiogenesis and increase drug penetration, we have further formulated LPD nanoparticles to co-deliver vascular endothelial growth factor siRNA and Dox. An enhanced Dox uptake and a therapeutic effect were observed when combined with vascular endothelial growth factor siRNA in the nanoparticles. Third, to avoid P-glycoprotein-mediated drug efflux, we further designed another delivery vehicle, LPD-II, which showed much higher entrapment efficiency of Dox than LPD. Finally, we delivered a therapeutic siRNA to inhibit MDR transporter. We demonstrated the first evidence of c-Myc siRNA delivered by the LPD-II nanoparticles down-regulating MDR expression and increasing Dox uptake in vivo. Three daily intravenous injections of therapeutic siRNA and Dox (1.2 mg/kg) co-formulated in either LPD or LPD-II nanoparticles showed a significant improvement in tumor growth inhibition. This study highlights a potential clinical use for the multifunctional nanoparticles with an effective delivery property and a function to overcome drug resistance in cancer.

Development of strategies to down-regulate the expression of P-gp or inhibit P-gp function has been the major subject of cancer research. For example, one of the strategies to overcome MDR is to use carriers like nanoparticles to avoid P-gp-mediated drug efflux. Only the drug presenting in the cell membrane can be effluxed out of the cancer cell. The drug delivered by nanoparticles is internalized in the cytoplasm or the lysosome and not pumped out by P-gp (1.Shah N. Chaudhari K. Dantuluri P. Murthy R.S. Das S. J. Drug Target. 2009; 17: 533-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Dox-loaded liposomes are able to overcome MDR by increasing Dox uptake in the nuclei and extending retention in the nuclei of the MDR cells (2.Xu D.H. Gao J.Q. Liang W.Q. Pharmazie. 2008; 63: 646-649PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Goren D. Horowitz A.T. Tzemach D. Tarshish M. Zalipsky S. Gabizon A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1949-1957PubMed Google Scholar).

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a promising novel approach of cancer therapy. It offers a new strategy to down-regulate the targeted oncogene for therapeutic intervention. Systemically delivering siRNA to tumors remains a major hurdle in cancer gene therapy (4.Devi G.R. Cancer Gene Ther. 2006; 13: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 5.Shen Y. IDrugs. 2008; 11: 572-578PubMed Google Scholar). Major problems of siRNA delivery include poor cellular uptake, low stability, and rapid clearance from the systemic circulation. We have developed a cationic lipid containing both a guanidinium and a lysine residue as a cationic head group that can down-regulate mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, form cationic liposome-polycation-DNA (LPD) to intravenously deliver siRNA to the solid tumor in high efficiency, and achieve a synergistic therapeutic effect with siRNA on a human lung cancer model (6.Chen Y. Sen J. Bathula S.R. Yang Q. Fittipaldi R. Huang L. Mol. Pharm. 2009; 6: 696-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this study, we further explored the biological activity of the guanidinium-containing cationic lipid, i.e. N,N-distearyl-N-methyl-N-2-(N′-arginyl) aminoethyl ammonium chloride (DSAA), which may play a role in overcoming drug resistance in tumors. However, nanoparticles containing cationic lipid such as DSAA showed a poor entrapment efficiency of Dox and induced immunotoxicity in mice. To combat these problems, we have further developed the multifunctional LPD-II nanoparticles made with anionic lipids that co-deliver siRNA and Dox into the MDR tumor cells and trigger a synergistic anti-cancer effect. We co-formulated siRNA and Dox in the LPD-II nanoparticles via Dox intercalation into the DNA in the nanoparticles. Both LPD and LPD-II nanoparticles were targeted specifically to the tumor cells by modification with anisamide (AA), a ligand of sigma receptor overexpressed in many human cancer cells. Two different siRNAs, VEGF and c-Myc siRNAs, are selected in this study to achieve the enhanced drug uptake and anti-cancer effect. We hypothesized that therapeutic siRNAs delivered to the MDR cells will down-regulate the target genes and sensitize the tumor cells to the co-delivered Dox, resulting in an enhanced therapeutic activity of the nanomedicine. The experiments were carried out in a xenograft model of the NCI/ADR-RES tumor. DOPA, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, and cholesterol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Protamine sulfate (fraction X from salmon) and calf thymus DNA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Dox was purchased from IFFECT CHEMPHAR (Hong Kong). Synthetic 19-nucleotide RNAs with 3′-UU overhangs on both sequences were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). For quantitative studies, FITC or cy5.5 was conjugated to 5′ sense sequence. 5′-cy5.5- and 5′-FITC-labeled siRNA sequences were also obtained from Dharmacon. The sequence of c-Myc siRNA was 5′-AACGUUAGCUUCACCAACAUU-3′, and the VEGF siRNA was 5′-GCAGAAUCAUCACGAAGUG-3′. The sequence of control siRNA with sequence 5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′ was obtained from Dharmacon. DSAA is a nonglycerol-based guanidine head group containing cationic lipid synthesized in five steps. N-Alkylation by n-octadecyl bromide and subsequent Boc deprotection of mono-Boc-protected ethylene diamine yielded the mixed primary tertiary amine N1,N1-dioctadecylethane-1,2-diamine. Tri-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl protected arginine conjugation to the primary amine group by the conventional 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. Quaternization of the tertiary amine group using methyl iodide on the above obtained product gave tri-N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-protected DSAA. To obtain the final product DSAA, Boc group deprotection with trifluoroacetic acid and chloride ion exchange with Amberlyst A 27(Cl−) ion exchange resin were carried out. The resulting compound was characterized by using 1H NMR spectra and liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry. Detailed synthetic procedures and spectral and purity data will be delineated elsewhere. 3S. R. Bathula, Y. Chen, and L. Huang, unpublished observations. NCI/ADR-RES and OVCAR-8 cells were a kind gift from Dr. Russell Mumper (University of North Carolina School of Pharmacy). NCI-ADR/RES is a multidrug-resistant ovarian cancer cell line derived from OVCAR-8 cells (drug-sensitive line) in a poorly documented manner (NCI, National Institutes of Health web site). NCI/ADR-RES cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium high glucose with GlutaMAX (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Female athymic nude mice 6–8 weeks of age were purchased from the National Cancer Institute, Frederick, National Institutes of Health. The mice were injected subcutaneously in the right flank with 5 × 106 NCI/ADR-RES cells in 0.1 ml of PBS. All of the work performed on animals was in accordance with and permitted by the University of North Carolina Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Calcein-AM has been used as a functional probe for the detection of P-gp activity (7.Holló Z. Homolya L. Hegedüs T. Sarkadi B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with lipids and incubated with 1 μmol/liter of calcein-AM for 15 min at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The cells were resuspended in calcein-AM-free medium, washed twice in PBS, and analyzed using flow cytometry. The uptake calcein-AM in the cells was expressed as: folds of untreated = (MFItreatment − MFIunstained)/(MFIuntreated − MFIunstained). NCI/ADR-RES cells (1 × 106/well) were seeded into 12-well plates. The cells were treated with lipids in serum-containing medium at 37 °C. Then the cells were incubated with 20 μm DCFH-DA (Sigma-Aldrich) in serum-containing medium for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were quickly washed and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry. LPD nanoparticles were prepared according to the previously described method with slight modifications (8.Cui Z. Han S.J. Vangasseri D.P. Huang L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2005; 2: 22-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, cationic liposomes composed of cholesterol and DOTAP or DSAA (1:1 molar ratio) were prepared by thin film hydration followed by membrane extrusion to reduce the particle size. 15 μl of protamine (2 mg/ml), 140 μl of deionized water, and 24 μl of a mixture of siRNA and calf thymus DNA (2 mg/ml) were mixed and kept at room temperature for 10 min before adding 120 μl of cationic liposome (20 mm). The formulations stand at room temperature for 10 min before the addition of DSPE-PEG. The formulations were then mixed with 70 μl of DSPE-PEG or DSPE-PEG-AA (10 mg/ml) and kept at 50–60 °C for 10 min for the attachment of the PEG chains to the surface membrane of the nanoparticles. LPD-II was prepared according to the previously described method with slight modifications (9.Lee R.J. Huang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8481-8487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Briefly, anionic liposomes composed of DOPA, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, and cholesterol (2:1:1 molar ratio) were prepared by thin film hydration followed by membrane extrusion to reduce the particle size. To prepare LPD-II, 48 μl of protamine (2 mg/ml), 60 μl of deionized water, and 24 μl of a mixture of siRNA and calf thymus DNA (2 mg/ml) were mixed and kept at room temperature for 10 min before adding 90 μl of anionic liposome (20 mm). LPD-II was left at room temperature for 10 min before the addition of DSPE-PEG. It was then mixed with 54 μl of DSPE-PEG or DSPE-PEG-AA (10 mg/ml) and kept at 50–60 °C for 10 min for the attachment of the PEG chains to the surface membrane of the nanoparticles. TEM images of the LPD-II nanoparticles were acquired by the use of JEOL 100CX II TEM (JEOL, Japan). Briefly, 5 μl of LPD-II nanoparticles was dropped on to a 300 mesh carbon coated copper grid (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA). Excess sample was removed by blotting with a filter paper. The grid was air-dried and viewed in TEM without staining. The scale bar was automatically shown in the image according to the magnification. NCI/ADR-RES cells (1 × 105/well) were seeded in 12-well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) 12 h before experiments. The cells were treated with different formulations at a concentration of 250 nm for 5′-FITC-labeled siRNA or 1.5 μm Dox in serum-containing medium at 37 °C for 4 h. The cells were washed twice with PBS, counterstained with DAPI, and imaged using a Leica SP2 confocal microscope. Dox and siRNA uptake of NCI/ADR-RES cells was also measured by flow cytometry. Briefly, the cells were treated with different formulations at a concentration of 250 nm 5′-FITC-labeled siRNA or 1.5 μm Dox in serum-containing medium at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were harvested and resuspended at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. The cells were washed with PBS and analyzed for fluorescence by flow cytometry. NCI/ADR-RES tumor-bearing mice (tumor size, ∼1 cm2) were intravenously injected with siRNA and Dox in different formulations (1.2 mg of siRNA/kg, one injection/day for 2 days). A day after the third injection, the tumors were collected, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned. 7.25-μm-thick sections were immunostained with primary antibodies and visualized by using kits from DakoCytomation. The samples were imaged by using a Nikon Microphot SA microscope or Leica SP2 confocal microscope. NCI/ADR-RES tumor-bearing mice (tumor size, ∼1 cm2) were intravenously injected with siRNA and Dox in different formulations (1.2 mg of siRNA/kg, one injection/day for 2 days). A day after the third injection, the mice were killed, and tumor samples were collected. Total RNA were extracted with the RNeasy® mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) by following the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA was then prepared in the presence of reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI). The mRNA levels were determined by an ABI PRISM HT7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described previously (10.Song E. Zhu P. Lee S.K. Chowdhury D. Kussman S.

The oligomer pairs used for the amplification of PCR products were AAGCCACAGCATACATCC (forward primer for c-Myc), TTACGCACAAGAGTTCCG (reverse primer for c-Myc), CACCACCAACTACTTAGC (forward primer for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and GTAGAGGCAGGAATGATG (reverse primer for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). NCI/ADR-RES tumor-bearing mice (tumor size, ∼1 cm2) were intravenously injected with siRNA and Dox in different formulations (1.2 mg of siRNA/kg, one injection/day for 2 days). A day after the third injection, the mice were killed, and the tumor samples were collected. Total protein (40 μg) isolated from the tumors was loaded on a polyacrylamide gel. Tumor lysates were separated on a 10% acrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% skim milk and then incubated with polyclonal antibody against c-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) overnight. The membranes were washed in PBST (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) three times and then incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibody. The membranes were washed four times and then developed by an enhanced chemiluminescence system according to the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Waltham, MA). The intensity of the bands was quantified by Photoshop histogram. Mice with a tumor size of ∼1 cm2 were intravenously injected with cy5.5-labeled siRNA (1.2 mg/kg) and Dox (1.2 mg/kg) in different formulations. 4 h later, the mice were killed, and the tissues were collected, fixed in 10% formalin, and embedded in paraffin. The tumor tissues were sectioned (7.25 μm thick) and imaged using a Leica SP2 confocal microscope. TUNEL staining was performed as recommended by the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). NCI/ADR-RES tumor-bearing mice were given intravenous injections of the siRNA and Dox formulated in the nanoparticles. 24 h after the second injection, the mice were sacrificed, and the tumors were collected for TUNEL staining. Images from TUNEL-stained tumor sections were captured with Nikon ECLIPSE Ti-U microscopy. NCI/ADR-RES tumor-bearing mice (size, 16–25 mm2) were intravenously injected with different formulations containing siRNA (1.2 mg/kg) or Dox (1.2 mg/kg) once/day for 3 days. Tumor size in the treated mice was measured after treatment. All of the statistical analyses were performed by Student's t test. The data were considered statistically significant when the p value was less than 0.05. Our first strategy is to use a cationic lipid as a P-gp inhibitor as well as a drug carrier. To determine whether the cationic lipid containing a guanidinium residue overcomes MDR, we first studied the uptake of Dox in NCI/ADR-RES cells. NCI/ADR-RES cells were treated with different lipids for different doses. Then cells were treated with the indicated concentration of free Dox. The structures of different lipids used in this study were illustrated in Fig. 1A. As shown in Fig. 1B, incubation with DSAA resulted in a substantial increase in Dox accumulation. The lipids without guanidine groups only caused a slight increase in Dox uptake. Besides, we also evaluated the ability of different lipids to inhibit P-gp using the calcein-AM assay in the resistant and sensitive cell lines (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1). In drug-resistant NCI/ADR-RES cells, the fluorescence generated from intracellular calcein significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner when cells were treated with DSAA. In contrast, DOTAP or the lipids without guanidinium groups only caused a slight increase in intracellular calcein fluorescence. However, intracellular calcein fluorescence remained only slightly changed after treatment with 10 or 50 μm DSAA for 1 h in the drug-sensitive OVCAR-8 cells (supplemental Fig. S1). Because drug-resistant cells treated with DSAA resulted in significantly enhanced Dox uptake and inhibition of P-gp activity, we further studied the biological functions of DSAA in some detail. The guanidinium head group of DSAA may induce ROS, which down-regulates P-gp expression in MDR cells (11.Hiramatsu M. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2003; 244: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 12.Cai Y. Lu J. Miao Z. Lin L. Ding J. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2007; 6: 1794-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To address this hypothesis, NCI/ADR-RES cells were treated with DSAA or DOTAP at different doses and further incubated with DCFH-DA. The cellular ROS content was detected by using flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 1D, DSAA could significantly generate ROS in NCI/ADR-RES cells 1 h after treatment. However, the cellular ROS content remained unchanged after treatment with 1, 5, or 10 μm DOTAP for 1 h. Furthermore, MDR expression in MDR cells was significantly suppressed after treatment with 10 or 50 μm DSAA (77 and 73% of untreated control, respectively) (Fig. 1E). These results suggest that ROS induced by DSAA may reverse drug resistance in NCI/ADR-RES cells by suppressing MDR transporter expression and activity. Based on the property of DSAA to enhance Dox uptake in the MDR cells, we further used DSAA as a carrier lipid to deliver Dox and siRNA into NCI/ADR-RES cells. We used AA-targeted LPD nanoparticles containing DSAA to specifically deliver Dox and siRNA to the NCI/ADR-RES cells, which express the sigma receptor (data not shown). As shown in supplemental Fig. S2, A and B), targeted nanoparticles containing DSAA increased both cellular internalization and nuclear uptake of Dox compared with free Dox. The nanoparticles containing DSAA delivered Dox into the cytoplasm of NCI/ADR-RES cells more efficiently than those containing DOTAP. Furthermore, Dox uptake of the cells treated with the targeted nanoparticles was much more than that of cells treated with the nontargeted nanoparticles. Pretreatment or co-incubation of cells with blank-targeted nanoparticles also showed slightly enhanced Dox uptake compared with free Dox. To eliminate the possibility that Dox uptake enhancement was due to apoptosis caused by DSAA, the cells were co-incubated with the caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD-CHO32 and Dox in the targeted nanoparticles containing DSAA. In this treatment, the uptake of Dox was as much as the treatment without the caspase-3 inhibitor (supplemental Fig. S2A). The uptake of Dox in the targeted nanoparticles containing DSAA was further examined in the other drug-resistant cells, H460/RES cells, which also overexpress P-gp. As shown in supplemental Fig. S3, targeted nanoparticles containing DSAA increased Dox uptake compared with free Dox in H460/RES cells. To confirm the ability of DSAA to deliver both Dox and siRNA into NCI/ADR-RES cells, Dox and fluorescently labeled siRNA were co-formulated into different formulations. As shown in Fig. 2A, the uptake of Dox and fluorescently labeled siRNA was much greater in cells treated with the formulation prepared with DSAA than the formulation prepared with DOTAP, and the uptake was ligand-dependent. Some Dox co-localized with siRNA in the cytoplasm, and some translocated to the nucleus after treatment of Dox and FITC-siRNA formulated in the targeted nanoparticles containing DSAA. The results indicate that the nanoparticles containing DSAA efficiently co-delivered siRNA and Dox to the NCI/ADR-RES cells, and the delivery was ligand-specific and formulation lipid-dependent. Our second strategy is to use a therapeutic siRNA to inhibit angiogenesis and sensitize the drug-resistant cells to chemotherapy drugs. To examine the biological activities of siRNA co-formulated with Dox in different formulations in vivo, the VEGF levels in the subcutaneous NCI/ADR-RES tumor were detected by Western blotting 24 h after two daily intravenous injections of VEGF siRNA and Dox in different formulations (Fig. 2B). VEGF expression of the NCI/ADR-RES tumor treated with VEGF siRNA and Dox-containing targeted nanoparticles was significantly suppressed (45% of untreated control) (Fig. 2B), whereas VEGF siRNA and Dox-containing nontargeted nanoparticles and a control siRNA and Dox-containing targeted nanoparticles showed no silencing effect. The results indicate that the nanoparticles containing DSAA could systemically deliver siRNA into the tumor tissue and silence the target protein. Furthermore, the silencing effect was specifically controlled by the targeting ligand. To further study the effect of VEGF siRNA and DSAA on Dox uptake in vivo, tumor-bearing mice were given two daily injections of VEGF siRNA or a control siRNA (1.2 mg/kg) formulated in the targeted nanoparticles containing DSAA or DOTAP. 24 h after the second treatment, free Dox or Dox formulated in the targeted nanoparticles containing DSAA was intravenously injected into tumor-bearing mice. The Dox uptake of NCI/ADR-RES tumor tissue in the tumor-bearing mice was observed 4 h after intravenous injections using confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2D, Dox formulated in the targeted nanoparticles showed enhanced cytosolic delivery in NCI/ADR-RES cells compared with free Dox. Free Dox uptake was higher in the tumor tissues collected from the mice treated with a control siRNA formulated in the DSAA-containing targeted nanoparticles than in those from the mice treated with a control siRNA formulated in the DOTAP-containing targeted nanoparticles. Furthermore, the formulated Dox uptake also increased in the tumor tissues collected from mice treated with a control siRNA in the DSAA-containing targeted nanoparticles rather than those treated with a control siRNA in the DOTAP-containing targeted nanoparticles (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that DSAA reverses drug resistance in NCI/ADR-RES tumors. VEGF inhibitors such as bevacizumab can enhance the permeability of the tumor vasculature, which leads to improved penetration of the free or liposome-encapsulated chemotherapy agents in the tumor (13.Almubarak M. Newton M. Altaha R. J. Oncol. 2008; 2008: 942618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that VEGF siRNA may improve the penetration and uptake of free Dox or formulated Dox in the drug-resistant tumor. As shown in Fig. 2D, free Dox uptake was higher in the tumor tissues collected from the mice treated with VEGF siRNA formulated in the DSAA-containing targeted nanoparticles than in those from the mice treated with a control siRNA formulated in the DSAA-containing targeted nanoparticles. Similarly, the formulated Dox uptake was also enhanced in the tumor tissues collected from mice treated with VEGF siRNA in the targeted nanoparticles compared with those treated with a control siRNA in the targeted nanoparticles (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that the uptakes of both free and formulated Dox increased after treatment with VEGF siRNA. To verify the regulatory effects of DSAA and VEGF siRNA on the expression of MDR transporters in vivo, MDR expression in the drug-resistant tumor was examined by immunostaining 24 h after two daily intravenous injections of VEGF siRNA or a control siRNA in different formulations (Fig. 2E). MDR expression of the NCI/ADR-RES tumor treated with VEGF siRNA or a control siRNA in the targeted nanoparticles containing DSAA was partially suppressed (Fig. 2E). A control siRNA delivered by the targeted nanoparticles containing DOTAP showed no effect. Thus, the data indicate that inhibition of the MDR expression mediated by the targeted nanoparticles was formulation lipid-dependent but not siRNA sequence-specific. Taken together, these results demonstrate a combination effect between VEGF siRNA and DSAA in promoting Dox uptake in NCI/ADR-RES tumors. A combination effect between VEGF siRNA and DSAA in promoting cellular apoptosis and tumor growth inhibition was further tested. To examine the therapeutic activities of siRNA and Dox in the different formulations, we stained for the apoptotic markers in NCI/ADR-RES tumors (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3A indicates that ∼8% of NCI/ADR-RES cells treated with VEGF siRNA and Dox in the targeted nanoparticles containing DSAA underwent apoptosis as detected by the TUNEL staining. This value was significantly higher than the cells treated with control siRNA formulated in the targeted nanoparticles containing DSAA or VEGF or control siRNA formulated in the targeted nanoparticles containing DOTAP. To further elucidate the therapeutic effects of Dox and VEGF siRNA in the nanoparticles containing DSAA, tumor growth inhibitory effects were evaluated after treatments of different formulations. Three injections of VEGF siRNA alone in the targeted nanoparticles containing DSAA showed a partial inhibition of tumor growth (p < 0.05 comparing with the untreated control at day 18) (Fig. 3B). Free Dox had no therapeutic effect. A synergistic tumor growth inhibition was observed when mice were treated with Dox and VEGF siRNA co-formulated in the targeted nanoparticles containing DSAA. Thus, targeted nanoparticles loaded with both VEGF siRNA and DSAA could sensitize MDR cells to co-formulated Dox. Furthermore, VEGF siRNA and Dox in the targeted nanoparticles containing DOTAP or in the nontargeted nanoparticles containing DSAA showed less therapeutic effect compared with the treatment of"

A strong decrease of intracellular GSH has been frequently linked to pathological conditions like ischemia/reperfusion injury and degenerative diseases including diabetes, atherosclerosis, and neurodegeneration. Although GSH is essential for survival, the deleterious effects of GSH deficiency can often be compensated by thiol-containing antioxidants. Using three genetically defined cellular systems, we show here that forced expression of xCT, the substrate-specific subunit of the cystine/glutamate antiporter, in γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase knock-out cells rescues GSH deficiency by increasing cellular cystine uptake, leading to augmented intracellular and surprisingly high extracellular cysteine levels. Moreover, we provide evidence that under GSH deprivation, the cytosolic thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase system plays an essential role for the cells to deal with the excess amount of intracellular cystine. Our studies provide first evidence that GSH deficiency can be rescued by an intrinsic genetic mechanism to be considered when designing therapeutic rationales targeting specific redox enzymes to combat diseases linked to GSH deprivation.

Our studies provide first evidence that GSH deficiency can be rescued by an intrinsic genetic mechanism to be considered when designing therapeutic rationales targeting specific redox enzymes to combat diseases linked to GSH deprivation. A reduced intracytoplasmic environment is prerequisite for proper cellular function and is collectively maintained by various antioxidant systems, free thiols, and nonprotein redox-active compounds (1.López-Mirabal H.R. Winther J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 629-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The controlled reversible oxidation and reduction of cellular proteins play important roles in the redox regulation of a myriad of cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and cell death. The tripeptide GSH is the predominant nonprotein sulfhydryl compound in mammalian cells (up to 10 mm) and is the major scavenger of reactive oxygen species by acting as co-factor for antioxidant enzymes like glutathione peroxidases. Oxidative stress and strongly decreased GSH levels are major causative factors in the etiology of multiple acute and chronic diseases, including Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and ischemia/reperfusion-induced tissue injury (2.Lin M.T. Beal M.F. Nature. 2006; 443: 787-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (4704) Google Scholar). By using mice and cells with inducible disruption of glutathione peroxidase 4, we have recently shown that oxidative stress does not cause overall oxidation of essential cellular compounds but is rather sensed by GSH and glutathione peroxidase 4 and translated into a distinctive cell death signaling pathway, involving 12/15-lipoxygenase-derived lipid peroxides and apoptosis-inducing factor-mediated cell death (3.Seiler A. Schneider M. Förster H. Roth S. Wirth E.K. Culmsee C. Plesnila N. Kremmer E. Rådmark O. Wurst W. Bornkamm G.W. Schweizer U. Conrad M.

Cell Metab. 2008; 8: 182-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Beyond its antioxidant activity, GSH is involved in the redox regulation of cell signaling via reversible glutathionylation of cellular proteins (5.Dalle-Donne I. Rossi R. Giustarini D. Colombo R. Milzani A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2007; 43: 883-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). This modification is believed to act as a redox-sensing mechanism under conditions of oxidative stress (6.Fernandes A.P. Holmgren A. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2004; 6: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). In addition, glutathione S-transferases are involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics by GSH conjugation (7.Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar, 8.Mannervik B. Danielson U.H. CRC Crit. Rev.

Embryonic lethality of γ-GCS knock-out mice at the gastrulation stage underlines the importance of GSH for embryo survival, growth, and development (9.Shi Z.Z. Osei-Frimpong J. Kala G. Kala S.V. Barrios R.J. Habib G.M. Lukin D.J. Danney C.M. Matzuk M.M. Lieberman M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Interestingly, γ-GCS−/− embryonic stem-like cells isolated from knock-out blastocysts can be cultured in vitro by provision of either GSH or the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in culture medium (9.Shi Z.Z. Osei-Frimpong J. Kala G. Kala S.V. Barrios R.J. Habib G.M. Lukin D.J. Danney C.M. Matzuk M.M. Lieberman M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The rate-limiting substrate for GSH biosynthesis is Cys, which is transported into the cell via neutral amino acid transporters. On the other hand, the cystine/glutamate antiporter, system xc−, facilitates the uptake of cystine (Cys)2, which is rapidly reduced to Cys presumably by GSH inside the cell, thus providing Cys for GSH synthesis (10.Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2256-2263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Bannai S. Kitamura E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2372-2376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). System xc− is composed of two protein components, xCT light chain (the light chain of cystine/glutamate antiporter system xc−), which confers the substrate specificity for (Cys)2, and 4F2 heavy chain, a subunit shared with other amino acid transport systems (12.Sato H. Tamba M. Ishii T. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11455-11458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). The expression of xCT appears to be regulated by oxygen, oxidative stress, electrophilic agents, and human immunodeficiency virus infection, which at least in part is mediated by the Nrf2/Keap1 system (13.Ishii T.

Sagara J. Bannai S. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 547-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In either case, up-regulation leads to increased (Cys)2 uptake and augmented intracellular GSH concentrations. In the brain, system xc− is predominantly expressed in regions facing the cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting that high levels of reactive oxygen species are counteracted at these sites by the supply of Cys (16.Sato H. Tamba M. Okuno S. Sato K. Keino-Masu K. Masu M. Bannai S. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8028-8033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activated neutrophils express xCT, indicating that system xc− protects neutrophils from oxidative stress during host defense (17.Sato H. Shiiya A. Kimata M. Maebara K. Tamba M. Sakakura Y. Makino N. Sugiyama F. Yagami K. Moriguchi T. Takahashi S. Bannai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37423-37429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). On the other hand, in glioma cells, xCT expression increases extracellular glutamate levels and induces glutamate toxicity, thereby contributing to neurodegeneration and brain edema formation. Hence, inhibition of xCT expression alleviates these symptoms during glioma development (18.Savaskan N.E. Heckel A. Hahnen E. Engelhorn T. Doerfler A. Ganslandt O. Nimsky C. Buchfelder M. Eyüpoglu I.Y. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). To address the significance of the (Cys)2/Cys redox cycle as an independent redox system and to challenge the supposedly unique role of GSH in redox homeostasis, we stably expressed xCT in γ-GCS−/− embryonic stem cell-like cells and in cells specifically lacking either mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase (Txnrd2) or cytosolic thioredoxin reductase (Txnrd1). Here, we show for the first time that GSH deficiency can be rescued by forced expression of xCT, which additionally requires the presence of functional Txnrd1, but not Txnrd2. The chemicals used for the experiments were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless stated otherwise. Tat-Cre fusion protein was a kind gift from Dr. W. Hammerschmidt (Department of Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Zentrum München). Anti-thioredoxin reductase 1 antibody was generously provided by Dr. V. N. Gladyshev (Lincoln, NE). A peptide comprising the C-terminal peptide sequence of Txnrd2 protein (VKLHISKRSGLEPTVTG) was synthesized and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and ovalbumin. The rats were immunized subcutaneously and intraperitoneally with a mixture of 50 μg of peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin, 5 nmol of CpG oligonucleotide (Tib Molbiol, Berlin, Germany), 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, and 500 μl of incomplete Freund's adjuvant. A boost without adjuvant was given 6 weeks after the primary injection. Fusion was performed using standard procedures. The supernatants were tested by a differential enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the Txnrd2 peptide coupled to ovalbumin and irrelevant peptides coupled to the same carrier. A monoclonal antibody (clone 1C4) that reacted specifically with the Txnrd2 peptide was used in this study. γ-GCS−/− cells were cultured as described (9.Shi Z.Z. Osei-Frimpong J. Kala G. Kala S.V. Barrios R.J. Habib G.M. Lukin D.J. Danney C.M. Matzuk M.M. Lieberman M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Knock-out MEF cell lines for Txnrd2 were established from Txnrd2−/− embryos as described (19.Conrad M. Jakupoglu C. Moreno S.G. Lippl S. Banjac A. Schneider M. Beck H. Hatzopoulos A.K. Just U. Sinowatz F. Schmahl W. Chien K.R. Wurst W. Bornkamm G.W. Brielmeier M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9414-9423Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Immortalized Txnrd1−/− and Txnrd1+/− MEFs were generated from conditional transgenic mouse embryos (Txnrd1+/fl and Txnrd1fl/fl), because it was not possible to establish the MEFs cell lines directly from knock-out embryos (20.Jakupoglu C. Przemeck G.K. Schneider M. Moreno S.G. Mayr N. Hatzopoulos A.K. de Angelis M.H. Wurst W. Bornkamm G.W. Brielmeier M. Conrad M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1980-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In these cell lines, disruption of Txnrd1 can be achieved by Cre recombinase leading to a loss of Txnrd1. Two independent Txnrd1fl/fl cell lines and one Txnrd1+/fl cell line were treated with Tat-Cre protein for 16 h, and clonal cell lines were generated by limiting dilution in 96-well plates. Out-growing clones were expanded, and the knock-out of Txnrd1 was confirmed by PCR for the deleted Txnrd1 allele (data not shown) and Western blotting (see Fig. 4A). Hence, after Tat-Cre treatment the cell lines derived from Txnrd1fl/fl and Txnrd1+/fl cells are Txnrd1−/− and Txnrd1+/−, respectively. The murine xCT expression vector pCAG-3SIP-xCT, empty vector, and eGFP-expressing vector pCAG-3SIP-eGFP, obtained after cloning of eGFP (pEGFP-N1; Clontech) into vector pCAG-3SIP, were transfected in 1 × 106 cells. Electroporation (Gene Pulser II; Bio-Rad) was performed at 240 V and 500 microfarads. Stable selection was initiated 48 h after electroporation using puromycin, gradually increasing from 0.5 to 2 μg/ml over 14 days. Northern blot analysis was conducted as described (21.Banjac A. Perisic T. Sato H. Seiler A. Bannai S. Weiss N. Kölle P. Tschoep K. Issels R.D. Daniel P.T. Conrad M. Bornkamm G.W. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1618-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The extra- and intracellular Cys and GSH levels were determined by HPLC as outlined (21.Banjac A. Perisic T. Sato H. Seiler A. Bannai S. Weiss N. Kölle P. Tschoep K. Issels R.D. Daniel P.T. Conrad M. Bornkamm G.W. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1618-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). l-Cystine transport activity was measured as described (15.Sato H. Fujiwara K. Sagara J. Bannai S. Biochem.

U.S.A. 1979; 76: 4932-4935Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated in fetal calf serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium ± cystine (Invitrogen catalog number 21013). 500 μl of conditioned medium was mixed with 50 μl of 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) solution (10 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) in 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) and incubated for 2 min. Absorbance was measured at 412 nm. Fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was used as blank control. Standard samples of reduced GSH (10–60 μm) were prepared by serial dilution in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Total RNA was isolated with an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), DNase-digested, and reverse-transcribed using a reverse transcription system (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). The transcripts were amplified and detected with a LightCycler FastStart DNA MasterPLUS SYBR Green I kit and a LightCycler 1.5 system (Roche Applied Science) using the primers xCTfor1 (5′-GGCACCGTCATCGGATCAGGCATC-3′) and xCTrev1 (5′-CACGAGCTTGATTGCAAGTTCAGG-3′) for xCT and aldolase A (5′-GGTCACAGCACTTCGTCGCACAG-3′) and aldolase B (5′-TCCTTGACAAGCGAGGCTGTTGGC-3′) for aldolase. Western blot analysis was done as described earlier (3.Seiler A. Schneider M. Förster H. Roth S. Wirth E.K. Culmsee C. Plesnila N. Kremmer E. Rådmark O. Wurst W. Bornkamm G.W. Schweizer U. Conrad M.

Co-culture experiments were performed by seeding xCT-overexpressing cells with eGFP-expressing cells in a 1:1 ratio in 6-well plates. The co-cultures were treated with the indicated l-buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) concentrations for 48–72 h and then analyzed by FACS (BD FACSCalibur) for the presence of eGFP-positive cells. The data were analyzed by the BD CellQuestTM Pro software (BD Biosciences). Annexin V-PI staining was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Pharmingen, Heidelberg, Germany). Briefly, the cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 100 μl of annexin binding buffer. Then the cells were incubated with 5 μl of annexin V-FITC (BD Pharmingen) and 5 μl of PI (20 mg/ml stock solution; Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. The cells were then analyzed by FACS (BD FACSCalibur), and the data were analyzed by the BD CellQuestTM Pro software (BD Biosciences). GSH is essential for the proliferation, growth, and development in mammals because the targeted disruption of γ-GCS causes early embryonic lethality (9.Shi Z.Z. Osei-Frimpong J. Kala G. Kala S.V. Barrios R.J. Habib G.M. Lukin D.J. Danney C.M. Matzuk M.M. Lieberman M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The embryonic stem cell-like cells derived from γ-GCS−/− blastocysts (referred to as γ-GCS−/− cells in the following) have been shown to be essentially devoid of endogenous GSH (9.Shi Z.Z. Osei-Frimpong J. Kala G. Kala S.V. Barrios R.J. Habib G.M. Lukin D.J. Danney C.M. Matzuk M.M. Lieberman M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1A); however, they can be cultured indefinitely when GSH or NAC is included in the cell culture medium (9.Shi Z.Z. Osei-Frimpong J. Kala G. Kala S.V. Barrios R.J. Habib G.M. Lukin D.J. Danney C.M. Matzuk M.M. Lieberman M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1B). Recently, we provided evidence that overexpression of xCT in Burkitt's lymphoma cells confers resistance to oxidative stress, imposed by seeding at low cell densities or by experimental GSH depletion (21.Banjac A. Perisic T. Sato H. Seiler A. Bannai S. Weiss N. Kölle P. Tschoep K. Issels R.D. Daniel P.T. Conrad M. Bornkamm G.W. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1618-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To address the question of whether enforced expression of xCT overrides the GSH requirement of cells, γ-GCS−/− cells were transfected with a bicistronic expression vector (pCAG-3SIP-xCT), allowing stable selection of transfected cells by puromycin. As controls, the cells were transfected with the empty vector (pCAG-3SIP, mock) or an eGFP expression vector (pCAG-3SIP-eGFP, eGFP). Single cell clones were isolated, and one mock transfected, one eGFP-transfected, and two xCT-transfected clones (xCT-5 and xCT-7) were used for further studies. xCT expression was confirmed by Northern blot (supplemental Fig. S1C) and quantitative RT-PCR (supplemental Fig. S1D). We then asked whether xCT expression permits cell survival and proliferation in the absence of GSH. When cultivated in the absence of thiol-containing supplements (Fig. 1, A and B), xCT-expressing cells continued to proliferate, whereas control cells rapidly died. Of note, xCT-overexpressing cells could be maintained indefinitely in the absence of thiol-containing supplements such as GSH/NAC in the cell culture medium (data not shown). To further substantiate that this effect was due to enforced xCT expression, xCT-overexpressing cells were treated with sulfasalazine, a potent inhibitor of system xc− (23.Chung W.J. Lyons S.A. Nelson G.M. Hamza H. Gladson C.L. Gillespie G.Y. Sontheimer H. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7101-7110Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Sulfasalazine treatment abrogated the pro-survival effect of xCT in the absence of GSH in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1C), showing that xCT overexpression successfully bypasses the requirement of GSH for cell survival and proliferation. To address whether xCT expression confers resistance also to oxidative stress-inducing agents, the cells were treated with pro-oxidants and genotoxic agents (hydrogen peroxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, antimycin A, doxorubicin), and cell viability was determined 48 h thereafter (supplemental Fig. S2, A–D). Control cells and xCT-expressing γ-GCS−/− cells died in a dose-dependent manner. No substantial difference in susceptibility toward the tested chemicals was detectable between xCT-expressing and GSH-supplemented γ-GCS−/− control cells, indicating that enforced xCT expression also substitutes for key antioxidant functions of GSH. To rule out any putative residual γ-GCS activity in γ- GCS−/− cells, NAC-supplemented eGFP-transfected or nonsupplemented xCT-transfected γ-GCS−/− cells were treated with high concentrations of the γ-GCS-specific inhibitor BSO. This was deemed necessary because the strategy for targeted disruption of γ-GCS only deleted the first exon, encoding the N terminus of γ-GCS (9.Shi Z.Z. Osei-Frimpong J. Kala G. Kala S.V. Barrios R.J. Habib G.M. Lukin D.J. Danney C.M. Matzuk M.M. Lieberman M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5101-5106Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). BSO treatment did not impact on cell survival or proliferation of xCT-transfected cells even at excessively high concentrations (1 mm) (supplemental Fig. S3), which are 20–100-fold higher than the toxic concentration for wild-type cells (19.Conrad M. Jakupoglu C. Moreno S.G. Lippl S. Banjac A. Schneider M. Beck H. Hatzopoulos A.K. Just U. Sinowatz F. Schmahl W. Chien K.R. Wurst W. Bornkamm G.W. Brielmeier M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9414-9423Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). These data indicate that BSO is a highly specific inhibitor of γ-GCS, and therefore it has been used in the subsequent studies for experimental GSH depletion. (Cys)2 uptake capacity was measured with radioactively labeled (Cys)2. Clone xCT-5 showed an 8-fold increase in (Cys)2 uptake capacity (0.82 ± 0.08 nmol/min/mg) as compared with mock transfected cells (0.08 ± 0.02 nmol/min/mg), which could be reduced to basal levels (comparable with mock) by the addition of glutamate (2.5 mm) (Fig. 2A), a specific inhibitor of system xc−. Intra- and extracellular Cys levels were quantified by HPLC to explore the fate of (Cys)2 upon uptake. Despite a 10-fold increase in (Cys)2 uptake activity, only a 2–3-fold increase of intracellular Cys was detectable in xCT-expressing cells (Fig. 2A). By stark contrast, extracellular Cys levels were increased 50-fold when compared with control cell lines. Accordingly, the levels of extracellular free thiols detected by Ellman's test increased in a time-dependent manner in xCT-overexpressing cells, whereas no increase was detected in control cells (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the levels of extracellular free thiols did not increase when cells were incubated in (Cys)2-free medium, confirming that the increase of extracellular thiols (Cys) could be fully attributed to imported (Cys)2 and subsequent efflux of Cys into the extracellular space. Because of the unexpectedly high extracellular Cys levels of xCT-overexpressing cells, we asked whether co-cultivation may allow for the proliferation of control cells. When xCT-transfected cells were co-cultured with eGFP-transfected control cells, we in fact observed that both cell lines proliferated at the same rate (Fig. 2C), indicating that xCT-overexpressing cells act in a feeder-like manner by providing Cys to eGFP-transfected control cells. Contrary to the assumption that GSH is the major source for (Cys)2 reduction, our studies with xCT-expressing γ-GCS−/− cells imply that the reduction of imported (Cys)2 is still operative in the absence of GSH. This presented an open question: what is the reducing force behind (Cys)2 reduction in the cells under GSH-deprived conditions? We hypothesized that the thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase system might be a likely candidate for exerting this function. In this context it is noteworthy that Txnrd2−/− cells have been shown to be highly susceptible to GSH depletion by BSO in contrast to wild-type cells (19.Conrad M. Jakupoglu C. Moreno S.G. Lippl S. Banjac A. Schneider M. Beck H. Hatzopoulos A.K. Just U. Sinowatz F. Schmahl W. Chien K.R. Wurst W. Bornkamm G.W. Brielmeier M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9414-9423Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Because BSO-induced cell death of Txnrd2−/− cells can be prevented by NAC (19.Conrad M. Jakupoglu C. Moreno S.G. Lippl S. Banjac A. Schneider M. Beck H. Hatzopoulos A.K. Just U. Sinowatz F. Schmahl W. Chien K.R. Wurst W. Bornkamm G.W. Brielmeier M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9414-9423Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), we asked whether xCT overexpression abolishes the effect of BSO on Txnrd2−/− cells in a manner similar to xCT-expressing Burkitt's lymphoma cells (21.Banjac A. Perisic T. Sato H. Seiler A. Bannai S. Weiss N. Kölle P. Tschoep K. Issels R.D. Daniel P.T. Conrad M. Bornkamm G.W. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1618-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To this end, immortalized Txnrd2−/− cell lines were established from knock-out embryos. The absence of Txnrd2 was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A). Then Txnrd2−/− cells were transfected with eGFP (control) and xCT expression plasmids, and stable cell lines were established after puromycin selection as outlined above. xCT overexpression was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 3B), which was corroborated by increased (Cys)2 uptake activity (Fig. 3C). As compared with eGFP-transfected control cells, xCT-overexpressing cells showed an ∼12-fold increase in xCT expression at the transcriptional level and an ∼2-fold higher uptake of radiolabeled (Cys)2 (Fig. 3, B and C). As illustrated in Fig. 3D, xCT overexpression in Txnrd2−/− cells conferred resistance toward BSO in a dose-dependent manner and led to an increase in the number of xCT-overexpressing Txnrd2−/− cells over time (Fig. 3E). Our data reveal that BSO-induced cell death of Txnrd2 null cells can be rescued either by NAC supplementation (19.Conrad M. Jakupoglu C. Moreno S.G. Lippl S. Banjac A. Schneider M. Beck H. Hatzopoulos A.K. Just U. Sinowatz F. Schmahl W. Chien K.R. Wurst W. Bornkamm G.W. Brielmeier M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9414-9423Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) or by enforced xCT expression. Furthermore, xCT-expressing Txnrd2−/− cells were able to rescue the eGFP-expressing control cells from BSO-induced cell death in co-culture experiments (Fig. 3F), implying that reduction of (Cys)2 is still functional in Txnrd2−/− cells. Because the requirement for GSH can be bypassed by xCT overexpression in Txnrd2−/− cells, we conclude that Txnrd2 is dispensable for efficient (Cys)2 reduction. After having seen that intracellular (Cys)2 reduction is functional in γ-GCS−/− and Txnrd2−/− cells, we then asked whether Txnrd1 might be the driving force for the utilization or recycling of thiol-containing compounds and for (Cys)2 reduction, be it directly or indirectly. Txnrd1 is localized in the cytosol and displays broad substrate specificity. Because we previously failed to isolate MEF cultures directly from Txnrd1−/− knock-out embryos (20.Jakupoglu C. Przemeck G.K. Schneider M. Moreno S.G. Mayr N. Hatzopoulos A.K. de Angelis M.H. Wurst W. Bornkamm G.W. Brielmeier M. Conrad M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1980-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), we established MEF cell lines from conditional Txnrd1 knock-out embryos (fl, floxed). Txnrd1 knock-out (in the following referred to as Txnrd1−/−) and Txnrd1 heterozygous (Txnrd1+/−) cell lines were derived from Txnrd1fl/fl and Txnrd1+/fl cells, respectively, after treatment with Tat-Cre fusion protein and subsequent single cell cloning. The absence of Txnrd1 was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 4A). Given our previous observation that we invariably failed to establish Txnrd1−/− cells directly from knock-out embryos (20.Jakupoglu C. Przemeck G.K. Schneider M. Moreno S.G. Mayr N. Hatzopoulos A.K. de Angelis M.H. Wurst W. Bornkamm G.W. Brielmeier M. Conrad M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1980-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), it was in fact surprising that Txnrd1 knock-out MEFs survived in culture. In line with this observation, Yoo et al. (24.Yoo M.H. Xu X.M. Carlson B.A. Gladyshev V.N. Hatfield D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 13005-13008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) reported recently that knockdown of Txnrd1 by small interfering RNA allows cell survival in vitro, although this approach does not rule out the possibility that residual amounts of Txnrd1 are still present in these cells. Next, we analyzed the effect of GSH depletion on Txnrd1−/− cells. Like Txnrd2−/− cells, Txnrd1−/− cells were highly susceptible to BSO (Fig. 4B). But unlike Txnrd2−/− cells, Txnrd1−/− cells could not be rescued from BSO-induced cell death by NAC supplementation (Fig. 4C, right panel), whereas antioxidant supplementation efficiently reversed BSO-induced cell death in Txnrd1+/− cells (Fig. 4C, left panel, and supplemental Fig. S4). This suggests that Txnrd1−/− cells are unable to exploit the beneficial effects of antioxidants to alleviate oxidative stress induced by GSH depletion. This phenotype was unprecedented and surprising because GSH depletion-induced cell death could be prevented in γ-GCS−/− as well as in Txnrd2−/− cells by the thiol-containing antioxidant NAC. Next, we established mock Txnrd1−/−, eGFP-Txnrd1−/−, and xCT-Txnrd1−/− cell lines and as controls mock Txnrd1+/−, eGFP-Txnrd1+/−, and xCT- Txnrd1+/− cell lines. Compared with eGFP-Txnrd1−/− control cells, xCT-Txnrd1−/− cells showed an 18-fold (17.73 ± 6.73) increase in xCT transcripts, translating into a 7-fold higher uptake of radiolabeled (Cys)2 (0.208 ± 0.022 versus 1.385 ± 0.347 nmol of cystine/min/mg protein) (Fig. 5, A and B).

Although AA is the preferred substrate, other fatty acids are oxygenated by these enzymes with varying efficiencies. We determined the crystal structures of AA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) bound to Co(3+)-protoporphyrin IX-reconstituted murine COX-2 to 2.1, 2.4, and 2.65 A, respectively. AA, EPA, and docosahexaenoic acid bind in different conformations in each monomer constituting the homodimer in their respective structures such that one monomer exhibits nonproductive binding and the other productive binding of the substrate in the cyclooxygenase channel. The interactions identified between protein and substrate when bound to COX-1 are conserved in our COX-2 structures, with the only notable difference being the lack of interaction of the carboxylate of AA and EPA with the side chain of Arg-120. Leu-531 exhibits a different side chain conformation when the nonproductive and productive binding modes of AA are compared. Unlike COX-1, mutating this residue to Ala, Phe, Pro, or Thr did not result in a significant loss of activity or substrate binding affinity. Determination of the L531F:AA crystal structure resulted in AA binding in the same global conformation in each monomer. We speculate that the mobility of the Leu-531 side chain increases the volume available at the opening of the cyclooxygenase channel and contributes to the observed ability of COX-2 to oxygenate a broad spectrum of fatty acid and fatty ester substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1981596240,"The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key cell growth regulator, which forms two distinct functional complexes (mTORC1 and mTORC2). mTORC1, which is directly inhibited by rapamycin, promotes cell growth by stimulating protein synthesis and inhibiting autophagy. mTORC1 is regulated by a wide range of extra- and intracellular signals, including growth factors, nutrients, and energy levels. Precise regulation of mTORC1 is important for normal cellular physiology and development, and dysregulation of mTORC1 contributes to hypertrophy and tumorigenesis. In this study, we screened Drosophila small GTPases for their function in TORC1 regulation and found that TORC1 activity is regulated by members of the Rab and Arf family GTPases, which are key regulators of intracellular vesicle trafficking. In mammalian cells, uncontrolled activation of Rab5 and Arf1 strongly inhibit mTORC1 activity. Interestingly, the effect of Rab5 and Arf1 on mTORC1 is specific to amino acid stimulation, whereas glucose-induced mTORC1 activation is not blocked by Rab5 or Arf1. Similarly, active Rab5 selectively inhibits mTORC1 activation by Rag GTPases, which are involved in amino acid signaling, but does not inhibit the effect of Rheb, which directly binds and activates mTORC1. Our data demonstrate a key role of Rab and Arf family small GTPases and intracellular trafficking in mTORC1 activation, particularly in response to amino acids."
https://openalex.org/W1971874692,"The human genome encodes several hundred microRNA (miRNA) genes that produce small (21-23n) single strand regulatory RNA molecules. Although abnormal expression of miRNAs has been linked to cancer progression, the mechanisms of this dysregulation are poorly understood. Malignant mesothelioma (MM) of pleura is an aggressive and highly lethal cancer resistant to conventional therapies. We and others previously linked loss of the 9p21.3 chromosome in MM with short time to tumor recurrence. In this study, we report that MM cell lines derived from patients with more aggressive disease fail to express miR-31, a microRNA recently linked with suppression of breast cancer metastases. We further demonstrate that this loss is due to homozygous deletion of the miR-31-encoding gene that resides in 9p21.3. Functional assessment of miR-31 activity revealed its ability to inhibit proliferation, migration, invasion, and clonogenicity of MM cells. Re-introduction of miR-31 suppressed the cell cycle and inhibited expression of multiple factors involved in cooperative maintenance of DNA replication and cell cycle progression, including pro-survival phosphatase PPP6C, which was previously associated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy resistance, and maintenance of chromosomal stability. PPP6C, whose mRNA is distinguished with three miR-31-binding sites in its 3'-untranslated region, was consistently down-regulated by miR-31 introduction and up-regulated in clinical MM specimens as compared with matched normal tissues. Taken together, our data suggest that tumor-suppressive propensity of miR-31 can be used for development of new therapies against mesothelioma and other cancers that show loss of the 9p21.3 chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W1995832842,"Assembly of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters and maturation of Fe-S proteins in vivo require complex machineries. In Escherichia coli, under adverse stress conditions, this process is achieved by the SUF system that contains six proteins as follows: SufA, SufB, SufC, SufD, SufS, and SufE. Here, we provide a detailed characterization of the SufBCD complex whose function was so far unknown. Using biochemical and spectroscopic analyses, we demonstrate the following: (i) the complex as isolated exists mainly in a 1:2:1 (B:C:D) stoichiometry; (ii) the complex can assemble a [4Fe-4S] cluster in vitro and transfer it to target proteins; and (iii) the complex binds one molecule of flavin adenine nucleotide per SufBC(2)D complex, only in its reduced form (FADH(2)), which has the ability to reduce ferric iron. These results suggest that the SufBC(2)D complex functions as a novel type of scaffold protein that assembles an Fe-S cluster through the mobilization of sulfur from the SufSE cysteine desulfurase and the FADH(2)-dependent reductive mobilization of iron."

Lung myofibroblast contraction induces integrin alpha(v)beta(5)-dependent latent transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 activation suggests that myofibroblast contractility may be a driving force for the persistent myofibroblast differentiation observed in fibrotic lungs. Understanding the mechanisms that regulate fibroblast contraction and mechanotransduction will add new insights into the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis and may lead to new therapeutic approaches for treating fibrotic lung diseases. We and others previously demonstrated that lung fibroblast expression of Thy-1 prevents lung fibrosis. The mechanisms underlying the anti-fibrotic effect of Thy-1 are not well understood. In this study, we showed that Thy-1 interacts with integrin alpha(v)beta(5), both in a cell-free system and on the cell surface of rat lung fibroblasts. Thy-1-integrin alpha(v)beta(5) interactions are RLD-dependent because mutated Thy-1, in which RLD is replaced by RLE, loses the ability to bind the integrin. Furthermore, Thy-1 expression prevents fibroblast contraction-induced, integrin alpha(v)beta(5)-dependent latent TGF-beta1 activation and TGF-beta1-dependent lung myofibroblast differentiation. In contrast, lack of Thy-1 expression or disruption of Thy-1-alpha(v)beta(5) interactions renders lung fibroblasts susceptible to contraction-induced latent TGF-beta1 activation and myofibroblast differentiation. These data suggest that Thy-1-integrin alpha(v)beta(5) interactions inhibit contraction-induced latent TGF-beta1 activation, presumably by blocking the binding of extracellular matrix-bound latent TGF-beta1 with integrin alpha(v)beta(5). Our studies suggest that targeting key mechanotransducers to inhibit mechanotransduction might be an effective approach to inhibit the deleterious effects of myofibroblast contraction on lung fibrogenesis."

To understand the mechanism of this resistance, we studied interactions of alpha1(I)(3) homotrimers and normal alpha1(I)(2)alpha2(I) heterotrimers with fibroblast collagenase (MMP-1). Similar MMP-1 binding to the two isoforms and similar cleavage efficiency of unwound alpha1(I) and alpha2(I) chains suggested increased stability and less efficient unwinding of the homotrimer triple helix at the collagenase cleavage site. The unwinding, necessary for placing individual chains inside the catalytic cleft of the enzyme, was the rate-limiting cleavage step for both collagen isoforms. Comparative analysis of the homo- and heterotrimer cleavage kinetics revealed that MMP-1 binding promotes stochastic helix unwinding, resolving the controversy between different models of collagenase action."

R-Smad (Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8) then binds to the phosphorylated GS domain (12.Huse M. Chen Y.G. Massagué J. Kuriyan J.

Recently, the hypothesis that the R206H mutation of ACVR1 might be associated with an impaired FKBP1A interaction and the induction of abnormal BMP signaling was suggested, but without clear supporting evidence (20.Shore E.M.

Also, Alp is known as an early representative marker of osteoblast differentiation and a direct target of Dlx5, which is stimulated by the activation of BMP signaling.

At present, there are no data on osteogenic transcription factor expression with respect to the R206H ACVR1 mutation in muscle cells to aid our understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlation. To date, although the causative genetic mutation of FOP has been successfully identified, there are few ongoing studies on the molecular consequences of the mutation or its underlying mechanism. Mouse myogenic C2C12 cells are suitable for a functional study because they represent the target tissue of FOP pathogenesis. Here, we show that the recurrent R206H mutation in ACVR1 is a weak activating mutation, which results in leaky signaling through a decreased affinity for FKBP1A. In addition, we report, for the first time, that the ACVR1 R206H mutation has reduced ACVR1 protein levels and a different subcellular distribution from the wild-type protein, with molecular consequences for the pathogenesis of the disease. Anti-V5 (R960-25) antibody was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Anti-Myc (9E10) anti-mouse antibody was purchased from Covance (Princeton, NJ). Anti-Myc (2272) anti-rabbit antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Denver, MA). Anti-β-actin antibody was from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Pierce. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody and a Qdot 655-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Bioactive recombinant human BMP-2 protein was purchased from R&D systems (Minneapolis, MN). Constructs encoding full-length human ACVR1 (GenBankTM accession no.

For the WT construct, PstI-BamHI WT fragments were used for subcloning into new pCMV5 vectors. For the K235R and Q207D constructs, BsmBI-PpuMI fragments were substituted with the same restriction enzyme site fragments of the purchased K235R and Q207D constructs from new pCMV5-ACVR1 WT. For subsequent cloning into pcDNA6/v5-HisA, the open reading frame corresponding to ACVR1 was amplified by PCR using the above constructs as templates, with DNA primers (IDT, Coralville, IA) containing an appropriate restriction site.

Stable C2C12 cell lines were generated by transfection with pcDNA6/v5-HisA constructs, followed by selection using 2–20 μg/ml Blasticidin S-containing selection medium. We used early passage stable cells (P2-P4) after selection. HEK293 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate, and after overnight culture, the cells were transfected with Hilymax (Dojindo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All plasmid DNAs were prepared using a DNA Maxi-prep kit (GENOMED, Loehne, Germany). Expression in cells and the transfection efficiency was confirmed by EGFP-vector transfection and immunoblotting.

Total RNA was extracted from C2C12 cells using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) or TRIzol® (Invitrogen). The concentration and purity of the RNA preparations were determined by measuring the absorbance of RNA at 230, 260, and 280 nm. The RNA integrity was analyzed on a 1% native agarose gel for checking 18 S and 28 S band, and cDNAs were synthesized with Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). About 100 to 150 ng of total RNA was used for analysis. We performed real-time PCR using Takara SYBR premix Ex Taq (Takara, Japan) in an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT; Coralville, IA). The primer sets for the analysis are listed in Table 1. The relative levels of target gene mRNAs were normalized to those of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh). We calculated the ΔΔCt value, which represents the cycle threshold difference between the target gene primer pair and the Gapdh primer pair in each sample.

After transfection, the cells were cultured for 24–36 h to 90% confluency and then treated with, or without, rhBMP-2 (30 to 50 ng/ml) for 24 h. Twenty-four hours after transfection, lysates were harvested in HEPES or TNE lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES or Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 3 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture) or CHAPS-TNE lysis buffer (20 mm CHAPS, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, protease inhibitor mixture) (32.Hartung A.

About 20 μg of whole cell lysate were separated by 10% to 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Nonspecific sites were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T). Blots were incubated with anti-V5 antibody (R960–25, Invitrogen) or anti-Myc antibody (9E10, Covance) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. The enhanced chemiluminescence blot detection kit was used as described by the manufacturer to visualize reactive products. Band intensity was quantified using the Fujifilm LAS-2000 system and Multi-gauze software (Fujifilm). For immunoprecipitation analysis, 800 μg of whole cell lysate were incubated with Myc antibody (9E10, Covance) for 6 h at 4 °C under constant rotation. After washing and resuspension in Laemmli sample buffer, protein G-agarose beads were boiled at 80 °C for 5 min. Bound proteins were resolved by 10% to 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-V5 or anti-Myc antibodies as described above. Twenty-four hours after C2C12 cell seeding, cells were treated with rhBMP-2 (30 to 50 ng/ml) for further 24 h, and the growth medium was changed after 1 or 2 days. After another 3–4 days of culture following rhBMP-2 treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, and stained for alkaline phosphatase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Stable C2C12 cells, transfected with WT ACVR1 or the R206H mutant, were grown in 6-well plates with coverslips after transfection with the FKBP1A construct using an electroporator. After 24 h, cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at 4 °C for 30 min and washed with PBS. Nonspecific sites were blocked for 30 min in PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Coverslips were incubated with the mouse anti-V5 antibody (R960–25, Invitrogen, 1:100) and rabbit anti-Myc antibody (2272, Cell Signaling, 1:100) for 2 h at room temperature. Slides were washed and then incubated with a green-fluorescent Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody and a Qdot 655-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 h. Confocal images were captured with an Olympus FV-300 microscope in Sequence scan mode using the HeNe laser at 543 nm and the Ar laser at 488 nm with the pinhole adjusted to three Airy units for both excitation and wavelengths. Images were collected and saved using the Software FV300 (Olympus Software) version 4.3 and exported to Adobe PhotoShop for digital processing. Despite its name, ACVR1 forms heteromeric complexes with BMPR-II, but not with ACVR2, binds to BMP-2, -4, -6, -7, but not to activin (33.Derynck R. Zhang Y.E.

However, the precise role of ACVR1 compared with other type I receptors in the BMP signaling pathway remains unclear. To characterize ACVR1, first we assessed the expression profiles of the BMP receptor family in murine myogenic C2C12 cells by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) (Fig. 1A). Cycle threshold (Ct) values reflecting the levels of expressed mRNA encoding each receptor were analyzed and normalized to that of Gapdh. We found that the expression of Bmpr1a was consistently the lowest of the five BMP receptors, Bmpr2 and Acvr2a were expressed at intermediate levels, and Acvr1 was the most abundantly expressed type I receptor, at levels ∼80-fold higher than Bmpr1a. There was a slight (less than 1.5-fold) increase in all receptor mRNA levels over a period of 24 h in response to BMP-2 treatment. Next we evaluated the contribution of ACVR1, in myogenic C2C12 cells, to the acquisition of osteoblastic characteristics by analyzing the expression of the osteogenic marker genes, Dlx5 and Alp (Fig. 1B). Overexpression of ACVR1 in C2C12 cells stimulated an increase in the expression of the BMP downstream genes, Dlx5 and Alp, but the increase was less than 2-fold. Although the increase of those genes in ACVR1-overexpressed cells by the treatment of BMP-2 was still apparent and statistically significant, the fold increase of Dlx5 and Alp mRNAs in response to BMP-2 treatment was much weaker in ACVR1 overexpressed C2C12 cells compared with that in vehicle-transfected cells. Similarly, ACVR1 knock-down did not alter the BMP-2-stimulated expression of Dlx5, Alp significantly (Fig. 1C). In contrast, blocking Bmpr1a expression with a siRNA resulted in a decrease of ∼90% in Dlx5 and Alp expression levels. In addition, blocking the expression of both Bmpr1a and Bmpr1b with their siRNAs also produced a marked reduction in BMP-2-induced Dlx5 or Alp expression. Interestingly, ACVR1 played a significant role in BMP-2-induced Dlx5 or Alp expression when both Bmpr1a and Bmpr1b were knocked down (Fig. 1D). We analyzed the knock-down efficiency of siRNAs against Bmpr1a, Bmpr1b, and Acvr1 by measuring their mRNA levels using RT-qPCR, and found that the expression of BMP type I receptors was decreased by ∼60% (data not shown). To investigate the genotype-phenotype correlation of the R206H mutation, we evaluated the expression levels of BMP-2-downstream osteogenic marker genes by RT-qPCR. The mRNA expression level of Dlx5, Alp, and Msx2 in WT, R206H, dominant negative (K235R), and constitutively active (Q207D) ACVR1-transfected cells were examined. Transient transfection of R206H significantly stimulated Alp mRNA expression but the level of expression was not comparable with that following BMP-2 treatment or transfection with the constitutively active form, Q207D (Fig. 2A). In the absence of BMP-2 stimulation, the Alp mRNA expression level in cells overexpressing the R206H mutant was ∼8-fold higher than that in ACVR1 WT cells (p < 0.001). Interestingly, the Alp expression level in Q207D-transfected cells was significantly higher (about 8-fold) than that of the R206H-transfected cells (p < 0.001). Treatment with BMP-2 for 24 h significantly stimulated Alp mRNA expression in all of the ACVR1 mutant-expressing cells; however, because of differences in basal Alp expression levels, the fold stimulation of Alp mRNA by BMP-2 treatment varied considerably: about 120-fold in WT, 18-fold in R206H, 6-fold in K235R, and 3-fold in Q207D compared with the respective BMP-2-untreated cells (Fig. 2A). To characterize the functional changes of the R206H mutant compared with the Q207D constitutively active mutant further, we analyzed changes in Alp activity in the presence of Smad or FK506. FKBP1A, the FK506-binding protein 1A, binds around the GS domain of the transmembrane domain in the type I receptor and prohibits leakage of the signal in the absence of ligand binding. As FK506 is known to sequester FKBP1A from the GS domain (37.Siekierka J.J. Staruch M.J. Hung S.H. Sigal N.H. J. Immunol. 1989; 143:"

Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). sGC is a heterodimeric protein, mostly in the α1β1 isoform, that stimulates the production of cGMP upon NO activation (5.Bryan N.S. Bian K. Murad F. Front Biosci. 2009; 14: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Under normal physiological conditions, NO-activated sGC stimulates vasodilation and is required for platelet disaggregation as well as neurotransmission (6.Murad F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 355: 2003-2011Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). During the pathophysiological conditions of oxidative stress common to vascular disease, the NO-sGC signaling pathway is disrupted due to sGC desensitization and degradation of sGC upon heme loss, thus limiting the extent to which traditional treatment methods such as nitroglycerin can increase sGC activity (7.Stasch J.P. Schmidt P. Alonso-Alija C. Apeler H. Dembowsky K. Haerter M. Heil M. Minuth T. Perzborn E. Pleiss U. Schramm M. Schroeder W. Schröder H. Stahl E. Steinke W. Wunder F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 136: 773-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). BAY 58–2667 can overcome these defects by activating sGC and protecting heme-oxidized sGC from proteasomal degradation (4.Evgenov O.V. Pacher P. Schmidt P.M. Haskó G. Schmidt H.H. Stasch J.P. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 8.Meurer S. Pioch S. Pabst T. Opitz N. Schmidt P.M. Beckhaus T. Wagner K. Matt S. Gegenbauer K. Geschka S. Karas M. Stasch J.P. Schmidt H.H. Muller-Esterl W. Circ. Res. 2009; 105: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These beneficial characteristics contributed to the pharmaceutical potential of BAY 58–2667, and this compound is in clinical trials to treat acute decompensated heart failure (9.Schmidt H.H. Schmidt P.M. Stasch J.P. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 191: 309-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 10.Boerrigter G. Lapp H. Burnett J.C. Handb. Exp.

The initial steps of BAY 58–2667 activation of sGC are fundamentally distinct from activation by NO (Fig. 1). NO binds a 5-coordinated His105-liganded heme, forming a brief 6-coordinated intermediate and subsequently causing breakage of the Fe–His105 bond to yield a 5-coordinated NO-bound heme in the activated state (Fig. 1B). In contrast, BAY 58–2667 activation of sGC is heme-independent yet takes place in the NO sensory H-NOX domain of sGC when it is heme-depleted (Fig. 1C) (12.Schmidt P.M. Schramm M. Schröder H. Wunder F. Stasch J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3025-3032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This crucial H-NOX domain is the N-terminal domain of the sGCβ1 subunit, which is adjacent to a Per-Armt-Sim (PAS-like) H-NOXA domain, followed by a coiled-coil domain, and the C-terminal catalytic guanylyl cyclase domain. The sGCα1 subunit has a similar domain arrangement, except that its N-terminal domain does not bind heme. sGC has not been amendable to crystallization, and structural studies of sGC have therefore been limited to individual domains of homologous proteins (13.Ma X. Sayed N. Beuve A. van den Akker F. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 578-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 14.Pellicena P. Karow D.S. Boon E.M. Marletta M.A. Kuriyan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Science. 2004; 306: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The H-NOX domain used in these studies that is most homologous to the H-NOX domain of sGC is Nostoc sp. H-NOX (Ns H-NOX), which shares 35% sequence identity with sGC, having similar properties including its ability to bind CO and NO (supplemental Fig. 1) (13.Ma X. Sayed N. Beuve A. van den Akker F. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 578-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). We present here the 2.3-Å crystal structure of the Ns H-NOX·BAY 58–2667 complex and mutational results revealing insights into the molecular mechanisms of sGC activation by a heme mimetic. soluble guanylyl cyclase wild-type Nostoc sp. We expressed and purified a C-terminally truncated version of Nostoc sp. H-NOX comprising residues 1–183 similarly as described previously for the full-length 1–187 protein (13.Ma X. Sayed N. Beuve A. van den Akker F. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 578-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The heme was replaced by BAY 58–2667 by adding a 10-fold molar excess of the heme oxidizer NS-2028 (Alexis Biochemicals) and 5-fold molar excess of BAY 58–2667 (obtained from Dr J. P. Stasch, Bayer Schering Pharma AG) at 37 °C prior to Superdex 75 chromatography to remove the displaced heme and unbound BAY 58–2667. Colorless crystals of the Ns HNOX domain bound to BAY 58–2667 were obtained using sitting drop crystallization at room temperature with a protein concentration of ∼10 mg/ml and a well solution of 1.8 m sodium malonate at pH 7.3. Crystals were cryoprotected in 3.0 m sodium malonate, pH 7.3, prior to dunking the crystal in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource beamline 11-1 to 2.3-Å resolution and processed using HKL2000 (17.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Crystals of BAY 58–2667 bound HNOX were in the same space group as for the heme-bound protein with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Twinning analysis revealed a twinning fraction of close to 0.5 (18.Yeates T.O. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 344-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), which was refined in REFMAC (19.Winn M.D. Murshudov G.N. Papiz M.Z. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 300-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) using the amplitude-based twin refinement with the H-NOX coordinates, without the heme, as the starting model (Protein Data Bank code 2O09; 13). The structure was subsequently refined using alternating cycles of fitting using COOT (20.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar) and REFMAC. Heme density was absent, yet strong density for the two copies of BAY 58–2667 was present after the initial refinement. Subsequently, two BAY 58–2667 molecules were added in refinement using a stereochemistry library file that was generated with PRODRG (21.van Aalten D.M. Bywater R. Findlay J.B. Hendlich M. Hooft R.W. Vriend G. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1996; 10: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). The structure was refined to a final R-factor of 0.150 with an Rfree of 0.193 and validated using PROCHECK (22.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 2001; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Data collection and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1.

COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin (100 units/ml). Cells were transfected with SuperFectTM reagent using the protocol of the supplier (Qiagen). Cells (100-mm dish) were transfected with 10 μg of plasmid encoding each wild-type or mutated subunit. After 40 h, cells were washed twice with 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. After washes, cells are scraped off the plate in cold lysis buffer: phosphate-buffered saline buffer contained protease inhibitors, 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl. Cells were broken by sonication (three pulses of 3 s). The resulting lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to collect the cytosol. sGC activity was determined by formation of [α-32P]cGMP from [α-32P]GTP, as described previously (23.Lamothe M. Chang F.J. Balashova N. Shirokov R. Beuve A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3039-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed for 5 min at 33 °C in a final volume of 100 μl, in a 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, reaction buffer containing 500 μm GTP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm MgCl2. Typically, 40 μg of cell cytosol was used in each assay reaction. Enzymatic activity was stimulated with the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine (SNAP) (Calbiochem) at 100 μm. sGC activity is expressed in pmol/min mg. To obtain the BAY 58–2667·Ns H-NOX complex, the heme of Ns H-NOX was first oxidized with the sGC-specific heme oxidizer NS-2028 (4H-8-bromo-1,2,4-oxadiazolo(3,4-d) benz(b)(1,4)oxazin-1-one); the heme was replaced by adding excess of BAY 58–2667 (cinaciguat; 4-((4-carboxybutyl)(2-((4-phenethylbenzol)oxy) phenethyl) amino)methyl(benzoic) acid). Subsequent crystallization and structure determination yielded the 2.3-Å resolution crystal structure of Ns H-NOX bound to BAY 58–2667 with two copies in the asymmetric unit (Table 1 and Fig. 2). Electron difference density in the heme-binding pockets of each copy clearly revealed the trifurcated BAY 58–2667 ligand density (Fig. 2B). The two carboxylate groups of BAY 58–2667 make extensive interactions: the carboxy-butyl moiety interacts with the side chains of Tyr134, Ser136, and Arg138, whereas the carboxylate moiety of the benzoic acid interacts with Arg138 and the main chain nitrogen of Tyr2 (Fig. 2C). Both copies of BAY 58–2667 in the asymmetric unit have a similar binding mode, although one of the carboxylates is slightly rotated (supplemental Fig. 2). Electron density for the third moiety of BAY 58–2667 extending from the tertiary amine, the extended tri-benzyl ring containing moiety, is well defined except for the terminal benzyl ring (Fig. 2B); the orientations for this terminal benzyl ring also vary slightly between the two crystallographic copies (supplemental Fig. 2). This hydrophobic third branch of BAY 58–2667 makes extensive hydrophobic interactions with residues forming the rest of the heme cavity including Leu4, Trp74, Thr78, Lys83, Phe97, Leu101, Leu104, Val108, Leu148, and Leu152 (Fig. 2C). Finally, the trifurcated tertiary amine is 4.1 Å from Trp71, apparently forming a cation/pi interaction of the positively charged amine and the pi clouds of the tryptophan. Despite having a shape dissimilar to heme, the trifurcated BAY 58–2667 folds up and occupies the heme cavity with its carboxylate groups superimposing on those of the heme propionate groups in the apo-Ns H-NOX structure (Fig. 3) published previously (13.Ma X. Sayed N. Beuve A. van den Akker F. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 578-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). BAY 58–2667, therefore, mimics heme in that it contains two hydrophilic charged carboxylates that interact with the YxSxR motif found to be crucial for heme and BAY 58–2667 binding (12.Schmidt P.M. Schramm M. Schröder H. Wunder F. Stasch J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3025-3032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 24.Schmidt P.M. Rothkegel C. Wunder F. Schröder H. Stasch J.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 513: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), yet, on the other hand, it is mostly hydrophobic and can “fold” in a somewhat planar heme-like fashion (Fig. 3C). A key functional difference between the two molecules is that BAY 58–2667 is a sGC activator, whereas heme is an inhibitor as the latter forms the covalent inhibitory bond with His105 (that normally is broken via NO binding). The Ns H-NOX structure with BAY 58–2667 in the activated state reveals a 3° rotation of the αF helix, normally tethered by the heme via His105, as analyzed by the program ESCET (Fig. 4 and supplemental movie) (25.Schneider T.R. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 714-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This rotation culminates in a ∼1-Å shift of the carboxyl terminus of αF comprising residues 110–111 (see supplemental movie). NO activation of sGC would likely induce a similar conformational change of αF as NO-heme binding causes the breakage of the αF-His105–Fe bond (26.Stone J.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and would allow this helix to shift to alleviate the steric clashes between the heme and His105 due to van der Waals repulsion interactions. This conformational change distorts the surface region comprising residues 110–116 and nearby flanking residues 40–46 (Fig. 4, A and B) and highlights a region that is likely to be used by H-NOX to transmit its activation signal to the rest of sGC upon NO or BAY 58–2667 activation. We therefore probed the importance of this region for sGC activation via alanine-scanning mutagenesis of surface-exposed H-NOX residues Arg40, Ile111, and Arg116. WT and mutant versions of sGC were expressed in COS-7 cells, and their guanylyl cyclase activity was assayed (Fig. 5B), revealing that these residues affect NO-stimulated activity. Mutation of residues Ile111 and Arg116 have an ∼4- and 3-fold, respectively, effect on maximal sGC activation, whereas mutation of residue Arg40 has the largest effect on NO-stimulated and basal sGC activity (Fig. 5B). These results suggests that sGC residues Arg40, Ile111, and Arg116 play a role in communicating H-NOX conformational changes to the rest of sGC and that there are likely some similarities between BAY 58–2667 and NO activation of sGC.FIGURE 4H-NOX conformational changes upon BAY 58–2667 activation.

By being able to mimic the heme yet avoid forming a covalent inhibitory bond with His105, BAY 58–2667 is able to bind to the heme pocket and yet allow the conformational activation change involving helix αF and its His105 residue. The largest shifts of the BAY 58–2667-bound Ns H-NOX structure compared with the heme-bound structure are in the C-terminal part of helix αF (Fig. 4). We postulate that this region, near residue 111, and the flanking region comprising residues 40–46 are therefore likely involved in communicating the activation conformational changes of the H-NOX domain to the rest of sGC. The importance of this region for sGC activation was probed by mutagenesis and indicated that the β1 H-NOX mutations R40A, I111A, and R116A negatively affect NO-stimulated cyclase activity (Fig. 5). Because these residues are mostly solvent exposed and not involved in direct heme binding or domain folding, these residues are likely involved in direct H-NOX/GC interactions (such a direct H-NOX/GC interdomain interaction had been previously observed (27.Winger J.A. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 4083-4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar)). In earlier work, residue Asp45 also was found to be important in sGC activation (28.Rothkegel C. Schmidt P.M. Stoll F. Schröder H. Schmidt H.H. Stasch J.P. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4205-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); this residue also falls within this surface region providing additional support for the proposed activation relevance of this region near residues 110–116 and 40–46. Future structural studies are needed to indeed confirm such a direct interaction between these sGC domain and also what the differences and similarities of the NO-bound 5-coordinated sGC structure is compared with BAY 58–2667. BAY 58–2667 is the result of substantial structure-activity relationship optimization (9.Schmidt H.H. Schmidt P.M. Stasch J.P. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 191: 309-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and its critical features agree well with its H-NOX binding mode and induced conformational activation changes (Fig. 6). A large number of BAY 58–2668 derivatives have been generated and their likely structural consequence within the H-NOX binding pocket, and their effects on rabbit saphenous arteries, will be correlated next. First, the pivot point of the BAY 58–2667 induced helix rotation of αF is near residue Leu101, a well conserved residue in sGCβ1. Leu101 interacts with the phenyl ring of the phenethylamino moiety of BAY 58–2667 (ring labeled 1 in Fig. 6), a group found to be key for BAY 58–2267 activity (9.Schmidt H.H. Schmidt P.M. Stasch J.P. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 191: 309-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Second, this phenyl moiety is in a hydrophobic internal H-NOX region, which explains why ring nitrogens introduced to convert the phenyl (labeled 2 in Fig. 6) to a heterocycle cannot be accommodated without negatively impacting the IC50 (9.Schmidt H.H. Schmidt P.M. Stasch J.P. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 191: 309-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Third, there is considerable variability possible with respect to the linker length of the terminal hydrophobic group being 4-phenethylbenzol in BAY 58–2667 (red oval labeled 3 in Fig. 6). Having just one phenyl ring at this position yields a potent sGC activator, although filling up the H-NOX cavity via longer linkers and having a second linearly connected phenyl ring (labeled 3b in Fig. 6) improve the IC50 values. In contrast, widening this linker at the nonterminal phenyl ring (labeled 3a in Fig. 6) or adding polar atoms to this linker moiety have negative effects likely due to the only narrow and hydrophobic space available to this moiety, which is flanked by Tyr83 and its own benzoic acid moiety (labeled 5b in Fig. 6) (9.Schmidt H.H. Schmidt P.M. Stasch J.P. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 191: 309-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These observations are in accord with our structure, which shows flexibility in the terminal BAY 58–2667 phenyl moiety and partial displacement of Phe112, suggesting that variations there can be accommodated with even longer variants such as BAY 60–2770 (9.Schmidt H.H. Schmidt P.M. Stasch J.P. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 191: 309-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Fourth, being released from the covalent bond with the heme, the His105 residue is pushed down ∼0.6–0.7 Å by the ethylamino moiety (labeled 4 in Fig. 6; Fig. 4). This latter group contains the trifurcated chiral branch atom of BAY 58–2667, the correct chirality at this position, and therefore likely also how far His105 is pushed away, has a major impact on its IC50 (9.Schmidt H.H. Schmidt P.M. Stasch J.P. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 191: 309-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Finally, the BAY 58–2667 structure also explains why the butyl-carboxylate (Fig. 6, 5a) is more important compared with the methyl-benzoic acid (Fig. 6, 5b) because replacing the latter with a hydrogen leads to only a 63-fold IC50 increase, whereas replacing the former leads to a drastic 4800-fold increase (9.Schmidt H.H. Schmidt P.M. Stasch J.P. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2009; 191: 309-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The BAY 58–2667 H-NOX structure shows that the butyl-carboxylate makes key interactions with all three of the pivotal YxSxR motif residues known to be crucial for BAY 58–2667 activation (24.Schmidt P.M. Rothkegel C. Wunder F. Schröder H. Stasch J.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 513: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28.Rothkegel C. Schmidt P.M. Stoll F. Schröder H. Schmidt H.H. Stasch J.P. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4205-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) holding this H-NOX region in place, whereas the benzoic acid carboxylate only interacts with Arg138 and the backbone nitrogen of Tyr2 (Fig. 2C). The dominance and importance of one of the carboxylates explains the potency of recently developed sGC activators with only one carboxylate, as described in a recent U.S. patent application (29.Bittner A.R. Sinz C.J. Chang J Kim R.M. Mirc J.W. Parmee E.R. Tan Q. U. S. Patent 20090209556. 2009; (August 20)Google Scholar). In summary, this analysis shows that two of the most critical features of BAY 58–2667 are its butyl-carboxylate moiety, which interacts with the YxSxR motif, and a long hydrophobic tail that can bend and occupy the mostly hydrophobic heme pocket. This analysis suggests that our BAY 58–2667 complex structure is a great tool for analyzing current analogs and likely also future analogs of BAY 58–2667. In summary, the Ns H-NOX protein continues to be a great tool for understanding sGC. In addition to being the closest bacterial homolog to the H-NOX domain of sGC in terms of sequence and ligand binding (13.Ma X. Sayed N. Beuve A. van den Akker F. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 578-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), we show here that Ns H-NOX is, like sGC, capable of having its heme displaced by the sGC activator BAY 58–2667 and that the observed binding mode of BAY 58–2667 strongly correlates with the published sGC structure activity relationships (SAR) data on BAY 58–2667 analogs (Fig. 6). In addition, the BAY 58–2667 binding mode is in agreement and structurally explains previous mutagenesis results that pointed to the strong role for the YxSxR motif present in both sGC and Ns H-NOX (12.Schmidt P.M. Schramm M. Schröder H. Wunder F. Stasch J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3025-3032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 24.Schmidt P.M. Rothkegel C. Wunder F. Schröder H. Stasch J.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2005; 513: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). And finally, the BAY 58–2667 induced shift of the His105-containing αF helix and adjacent loop point to the importance of the surface patch comprised of regions 110–116 (and flanking residues 40–46), which we subsequently probed with sGC mutagenesis experiments (Fig. 5). These combined results point to the importance of this surface region for sGC activation by BAY 58–2667, which possibly shares some mechanistic similarities with NO activation of sGC. These cohesive results therefore aid in our understanding of sGC activation by a heme-mimetic and how BAY 58–2667 protects sGC from degradation by stabilizing the heme cavity and offer new structure-based design strategies to pharmaceutically further target the sGC protein to treat certain cardiovascular diseases.

https://openalex.org/W1998060705,"Skeletal muscle mass is regulated by signaling pathways that govern protein synthesis and cell proliferation, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a key role in these processes. Recent studies suggested the crucial role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the inhibition of protein synthesis and cell growth. Here, we address the role of AMPK in the regulation of muscle cell size in vitro and in vivo. The size of AMPK-deficient myotubes was 1.5-fold higher than for controls. A marked increase in p70S6K Thr389 and rpS6 Ser-235/236 phosphorylation was observed concomitantly with an up-regulation of protein synthesis rate. Treatment with rapamycin prevented p70S6K phosphorylation and rescued cell size control in AMPK-deficient cells. Importantly, myotubes lacking AMPK were resistant to further cell size increase beyond AMPK deletion alone, as MyrAkt-induced hypertrophy was absent in these cells. Moreover, in skeletal muscle-specific deficient AMPKα1/α2 KO mice, soleus muscle showed a higher mass with myofibers of larger size and was associated with increased p70S6K and rpS6 phosphorylation. Our results uncover the role of AMPK in the maintenance of muscle cell size control and highlight the crosstalk between AMPK and mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathways coordinating a metabolic checkpoint on cell growth.—Lantier, L., Mounier, R., Leclerc, J., Pende, M., Foretz, M., Viollet, B.

Clinically, esophageal cancer represents a highly aggressive tumor type with poor prognosis resulting in a 5-year survival rate of 5%. The aim of the present study was the detailed analysis of the role of HA synthesis for ESCC phenotype in vitro using the ESCC cell line OSC1. In OSC1 cells, pericellular HA-matrix surrounding extended actin-dependent filopodia was detected. The small molecule inhibitor of HA synthesis, 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU, 0.3 mm) caused loss of these filopodia and focal adhesions and inhibited proliferation and migration. In search of the underlying mechanism cleavage of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was detected by immunoblotting. In addition, displacing HA by an HA-binding peptide (Pep-1, 500 μg/ml) and digestion of pericellular HA by hyaluronidase resulted in cleavage of focal adhesions. Furthermore, real-time reverse transcription PCR revealed that HA synthase 3 (HAS3) > HAS2 are the predominant HA-synthases in OSC1. Lentiviral transduction with shHAS3, and to a lesser extent with shHAS2, reduced intact FAK protein and filopodia as well as proliferation and migration. Furthermore, down-regulation by lentiviral shRNA of RHAMM (receptor of HA-mediated motility) but not CD44 induced loss of filopodia and caused FAK cleavage. In contrast, knockdown of both HA receptors inhibited proliferation and migration of OSC1. In conclusion, HA synthesis and, in turn, RHAMM and CD44 signaling promoted an activated phenotype of OSC1. Because RHAMM appears to support both filopodia, FAK, and the proliferative and migratory phenotype, it may be promising to explore RHAMM as a potential therapeutic target in esophageal cancer.

HAS isoenzymes produce HA of different chain lengths, and HA is subsequently degraded by hyaluronidases. HA is an unbranched high molecular weight polysaccharide that is composed of d-glucuronic acid β(1–3)-d-N-acetyl-glucosamine-β(1–4) without further modifications. A variety of different types of cancer is characterized by high amounts of tumor cell-associated HA (e.g. colon and gastric cancer), and in some of these malignancies, such as colon cancer, tumor-associated HA is an independent prognostic factor for poor outcome (1.Ropponen K.

The activity of all three isoforms of the hyaluronan synthase family (HAS1–3) can be inhibited by 4-methylumbelliferone, which interferes with HAS activity by depleting the activated uridine diphosphate-glucuronic acid precursor pool (3.Kakizaki I.

CD44 is an adhesion receptor and an HA receptor that serves, together with the expression of CD24 or CD133, as a surface marker for the tumorigenic potential of breast cancer and colon cancer cells (7.Haraguchi N.

The understanding of the role of the HA matrix in the pathophysiology of esophageal cancer may contribute to the definition of targets for novel HA-based therapeutic approaches.

Key experiments were also performed in other ESCC lines (Kyse 30, -270, -410, -520)(26.Shimada Y. Imamura M. Wagata T. Yamaguchi N. Tobe T. Cancer. 1992; 69: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) obtained from DSMZ (German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany). OSC1 and Kyse cells were maintained as monolayer cultures in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 95% humidified air. DNA synthesis was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation, and migration was assessed using a microchemotaxis assay as described previously (27.Dai G. Freudenberger T. Zipper P. Melchior A.

Cultured cells were fixed for 20 min either with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline or with acetone:methanol (1:1) at −20 °C. HA was detected using biotinylated hyaluronan-binding protein (HABP, Seikagaku; 6 μg/ml) and fluorescein isothiocyanate- or Cy3-labeled streptavidin (Dako, Hamburg, Germany; 1:200) or Alexa 594-coupled HABP (28.Rilla K. Tiihonen R. Kultti A. Tammi M. Tammi R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2008; 56: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Actin stress fibers were stained by fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin and membranes by the membrane marker WGA Alexa Fluor® 555 conjugate (Invitrogen). Other primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-phospho-FAK (Tyr397, Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:500), monoclonal mouse anti-CD44H (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden, Germany; 1:500), mouse anti-paxillin (BD Transduction Laboratories; 1:500), monoclonal mouse anti-β-tubulin I (Sigma-Aldrich; 1:20,000) and polyclonal anti-RHAMM (R36) (23.Savani R.C.

For detection, the appropriate secondary antibodies labeled either with fluorescein isothiocyanate or Cy3 (Sigma-Aldrich) were applied. Nuclei were counterstained by Hoechst 33342 solution (Invitrogen; 1:20,000). For blocking experiments, polyclonal anti-RHAMM (R36, 100 μg/ml) was applied for 1 h, and normal rabbit IgG (100 μg/ml) (AB-105-C, R&D Systems) was used as control. Blocking CD44 was performed by adding blocking anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody Hermes-1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (40 μg/ml) for 1 h, whereas control rat IgG2α (40 μg/ml) was used as control. For Western blot analysis, whole cell lysates were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and the following primary antibodies were used: pAKT, Akt/PKB, pERK1/2, Erk1/2, pFAK (Cell Signaling Technology), FAK, cleaved FAK (C20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), β-actin (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), and tubulin (Sigma Aldrich) and were either detected by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies or infrared fluorescent-coupled secondary antibodies, allowing fluorescent detection on a LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imaging System. Cells were plated at a density of 105 cells per well in 6-well plates and allowed to adhere for 24 h. HA released into the culture medium was measured with an HABP-based commercial kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Corgenix, Broomfield, CO). The quantity of HA was expressed per mg of total cellular protein. For proteoglycan secretion, cells were seeded at 2 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates and kept for 24 h in growth medium in the presence of 35SO42− (10 μCi/well, Hartmann Analytic). 35S-labeled sulfated glycosaminoglycans were quantified using cetylpyridinium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) precipitation as described by Wasteson et al. (29.Wasteson A. Uthne K. Westermark B. Biochem. J. 1973; 136: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Total RNA from OSC1 cells was isolated by using TriReagent® (Sigma-Aldrich), and cDNA was synthesized by using the Superscript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). The PCR reactions were performed by using the 7300 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Relative expression levels were compared by using real-time PCR with the 2−ΔΔC(T) method.

The used shRNA sequences are stated in Table 2. A scrambled shRNA was used as a control. The transfer into the packaging line HEK 293T (ATCC) was performed with the lipofection reagent FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). After 16 h, the medium was changed to Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium for better stability of the produced lentiviral particles. The next day, the lentiviruses were harvested, and target cells were transfected at a multiplicity of infection of 10 and kept for 5 days in normal growth medium before fixation. All data sets were analyzed either by analysis of variance and the Bonferroni post hoc test or by Student's t test as appropriate. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical significance was assigned at the level of p < 0.05. Incubating OSC1 cells with 0.3 mm 4-MU decreased the total amount of HA secreted into the medium to 50.7% ± 10.7% (n = 3, p < 0.05) of that secreted by untreated OSC1 cells. As a control, the effect of 4-MU on proteoglycan synthesis by incorporation of 35SO42− into sulfated glycosaminoglycans chains was determined. Because 0.3 mm of 4-MU specifically inhibited HA synthesis without affecting sulfated proteoglycans (94.3% ± 1,5%, n = 3 of control, p > 0.05), this concentration was used throughout the study. Interestingly, the shape of OSC1 cells changed remarkably in response to the inhibition of HA synthesis by 4-MU. These phenotypical changes comprised cell clustering, a uniform flat appearance, and smoother cell borders than those of untreated control cells (Fig. 1A, arrows). Moreover, a dramatic decrease in actin cytoskeleton staining (Fig. 1B) occurred in the presence of 4-MU. This finding suggests that 4-MU interferes with either actin fiber formation or actin fiber anchoring, e.g. disassembly of focal adhesion complexes. In contrast, the tubulin network remained intact in response to 4-MU (Fig. 1C, green). In addition, OSC1 regularly exhibited numerous filopodia, which were detectable by the WGA Alexa Fluor® 555 conjugate as membrane marker (Fig. 1C, red). Similar filopodia have been associated previously with tumor cell transformation (30.Kovbasnjuk O. Mourtazina R. Baibakov B. Wang T. Elowsky C. Choti M.A. Kane A. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 19087-19092Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Notably, 4-MU caused rapid resolution of these protrusions within 1 h after application (Fig. 1C, right). Confocal imaging of live cells that had been stained with Alexa 594-coupled HABP revealed a continuous pericellular HA matrix that covered the entire OSC1 cell, including the filopodial protrusions (Fig. 1D). Also, in fixed OSC1 cells stained for CD44 and HA, the association between HA and CD44-positive protrusions was obvious (Fig. 1E). Filopodia contained actin fibers as shown in Fig. 1F. Therefore, the inhibitor of actin polymerization latrunculin A (2 μm, 5 min), was used to investigate the dependence of filopodia on the actin cytoskeleton. The incidence of filopodia was reduced in parallel to actin depolymerization, which began as early as 3 min after latrunculin A application (data not shown), whereas the cortical parts of the cytoskeleton were still intact at this time. After 5 min, the inhibition of filopodia was almost complete (Fig. 1F, right). Subsequently, the contribution of focal adhesion (FA) function to the maintenance of filopodia was analyzed by treatment with the FAK inhibitor AG82 (10 μm, 1 h). AG82 completely inhibited the cell protrusions (Fig. 1G). Taken together, these results indicate that OSC1 cells extend actin-based filopodia that are dependent on HA synthesis and FAK activity. To address the mechanism by which the inhibition of HA synthesis interferes with FAK and FAs, we used immunostaining of phosphorylated FAK (Fig. 2A, yellow) and paxillin (Fig. 2B, red) to analyze the distribution and activity of focal adhesion complexes after treatment with 4-MU. The levels of both pFAK and paxillin were dramatically lower in focal adhesions in response to 4-MU (24 h). In addition, we performed immunoblot analysis to measure the amount of total and phosphorylated FAK (Fig. 2C). In line with the results of immunofluorescence staining, these results showed a strong decrease in the levels of both total FAK (tFAK) and pFAK. Using an antibody that detects C-terminal FAK cleavage products, we identified rapid cleavage of FAK starting between 15 and 30 min after the addition of 4-MU as the reason for the reduction in tFAK (Fig. 2D). The most prominent bands run at 125, 100, 70, and 48 kDa; these findings are in agreement with those reported previously (31.Levkau B. Herren B. Koyama H. Ross R. Raines E.W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To ensure that the observed phenomena were specific responses to the inhibition of HA synthesis by 4-MU, we investigated the effects of other agents known to either degrade or displace HA. Indeed, we found that FAK degradation was also induced 5 min after the application of Streptomyces hyaluronidase (Fig. 2E, upper panel) and 24 h after the application of Pep-1 (500 μg/ml), a hyaluronan binding and displacing peptide (24.Mummert M.E. Mohamadzadeh M. Mummert D.I. Mizumoto N. Takashima A. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2E, lower panel). To determine whether the formation of HA-dependent filopodia was specific to OSC1 or a more general phenomenon, we treated additional human ESCC cell lines with 4-MU. As shown in Fig. 3A, filopodia sensitive to 4-MU were detected also in other ESCC cell lines such as Kyse 520. Furthermore, FAK degradation in response to 4-MU occurred in four out of five tested cell lines such as Kyse 520, 410, 270 (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that the pericellular HA matrix is required for filopodial plasma membrane extensions and suggest that the absence of HA results in rapid degradation of FAK and the breakdown of filopodia. In addition, the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2, an important downstream target of FAK, was analyzed between 5 min and 20 min after the addition of 4-MU. It was found that reduction of phosphorylation of ERK1/2 concurred with FAK cleavage at 20 min (Fig. 4, A and B). In turn, incubation with 4-MU significantly inhibited proliferation, which was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation in response to 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and migration as determined by a modified Boyden chamber assay in response to 10% FCS: [3H]thymidine incorporation was 61.7% ± 7.2% that of untreated controls, and migration was 45.4% ± 3.8% that of untreated controls (n = 3–5, mean ± S.E., p < 0.05, Fig. 4C). Because HAS3 and HAS2 are the main HAS isoforms in OSC1 cells, we investigated whether the molecular and cellular events mediating the inhibitory effects of 4-MU could be recapitulated by the knockdown of HAS3 or HAS2 in OSC1 cells in vitro. Knockdown of HAS3 and to a lesser extent of HAS2 reduced HA secretion into the medium (Fig. 5A) as expected from the relative expression levels of HAS2 and HAS3. In response to knockdown of HAS3, the phenotypical changes and the resolution of filopodia (Fig. 5B) closely resembled the changes produced by 4-MU. In addition, shHAS2 partially reduced filopodia as well and induced a smoother outline of cell clusters. Western blot analysis using the C-terminal FAK antibody showed pronounced FAK cleavage after HAS3 and HAS2 knockdown (Fig. 6A). Concomitantly Akt/PKB and ERK phosphorylation were reduced by shHAS3 and shHAS2 (Fig. 6B). In turn, shHAS3 and shHAS2 reduced the proliferative and migratory response to FCS (Fig. 6C). Altogether, the cellular responses to HAS3 and HAS2 knockdown support the conclusion that HA synthesis plays a key role in the maintenance of filopodia and FAK protein levels as well as ERK and Akt/PKB signaling in OSC1 cells.FIGURE 6Lentiviral knockdown of HAS3 and HAS2 cause FAK cleavage and inhibit proliferation and migration. A, lentiviral knockdown of HAS3 and HAS2 was performed as described in Fig. 5. Increased cleavage of tFAK resulting in the loss of total intact 125-kDa FAK occurred after shHAS3 expression. This effect was present but less pronounced after knockdown of shHAS2. Quantitative analysis of 125-kDa tFAK and degraded tFAK (<125 kDa) after normalization to tubulin and to scrambled (scr) controls (n = 3, mean ± S.E.). *, p < 0.05 versus scrambled shRNA.

In response to 4-MU, CD44 was more pronounced in the circumference of the OSC1 cells, which might be due to a redistribution or due to the change in cell shape. In contrast, the expression pattern of RHAMM was not affected by 4-MU. To identify the HA receptors involved in the regulation of tFAK protein levels, and the maintenance of filopodia CD44 and RHAMM were down-regulated by lentiviral shRNA. Interestingly, shCD44 did not affect filopodial integrity (Fig. 7C) or tFAK levels (Fig. 8A). In contrast, shRHAMM led to a complete inhibition of filopodia (Fig. 7D) and a strong decrease in intact tFAK levels (Fig. 8A). However, both shRHAMM and shCD44 decreased Akt/PKB and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 8B) in OSC1 cells. Furthermore, both shCD44 and shRHAMM reduced proliferation and migration in response to FCS (Fig. 8C).FIGURE 8FAK cleavage is induced specifically by down-regulation of RHAMM. A, lentiviral shRNA targeting CD44 and RHAMM were used as in Fig. 7. Immunoblotting of tFAK and quantitative analysis of 125-kDa tFAK and degraded tFAK (<125 kDa) revealed that shCD44 had no effect on FAK, whereas shRHAMM induced pronounced FAK cleavage compared with the scrambled lentiviral vector. Data are normalized to tubulin and to scrambled control (n = 3, mean ± S.E.). *, p < 0.05 versus scrambled control vector. B, phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 were reduced by shRNA targeting both CD44 and RHAMM. Data were normalized to tubulin as loading control and to scrambled controls. C, both shCD44 and shRHAMM inhibited migration toward FCS as determined in a 24-well microchemotaxis assay and reduced DNA synthesis as determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation in response to FCS expressed as cpm per total cellular protein (n = 3). **, p < 0.01, ***, p < 0.001 versus scrambled control vector. scr, scrambled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In addition to shRNA, blocking antibodies against CD44 (Hermes-1) and RHAMM (R36) were used. In line with the results obtained with shRNA, only blocking RHAMM caused loss of filopodia and FAK cleavage (supplemental figure). Blocking antibodies against CD44 inhibited Akt/PKB and ERK phosphorylation and blocking RHAMM by R36 resulted only in reduced Akt/PKB phosphorylation (supplemental figure). Thus, inhibiting RHAMM closely mimics all effects of 4-MU, shHAS3, and shHAS2, whereas inhibition of CD44 lacks the effects on filopodia and FAK. Therefore, it may be concluded that RHAMM plays a crucial role in transducing the effects of pericellular HA on the maintenance of FA and filopodial integrity in OSC1 cells, whereas both HA receptors are involved in ERK and Akt/PKB signaling. HA synthesis is not sufficient for malignant transformation (32.Itano N. Atsumi F. Sawai T. Yamada Y. Miyaishi O. Senga T. Hamaguchi M. Kimata K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 3609-3614Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), but HA, HA-binding proteins, and HA receptors provide a matrix environment that supports the malignant phenotype of cancer cells, stromal cell recruitment, and, thus, the progression of cancer (33.Tammi R.H. Kultti A. Kosma V.M. Pirinen R. Auvinen P. Tammi M.I. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2008; 18: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In human ESCC, HA accumulates in the parenchyma and stroma, and HA is produced by both tumor cells and stroma (22.Wang C. Tammi M. Guo H. Tammi R. Am J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1861-1869PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Twarock S. Röck K. Sarbia M. Weber A.A. Jänicke R.U. Fischer J.W. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; 157: 234-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Here, an analysis of the molecular and cellular effects of HA synthesis on ESCC phenotype is provided. In addition to the inhibition of proliferation and migration, 4-MU also repressed the formation of cell protrusions. These cell protrusions were reminiscent of the filopodia that have in previous studies been associated with the malignant phenotype of cancer cells (30.Kovbasnjuk O. Mourtazina R. Baibakov B. Wang T. Elowsky C. Choti M.A. Kane A. Donowitz M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 19087-19092Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was demonstrated recently that overexpression of HAS3 in several cell lines causes pronounced microvilli that were sensitive to 4-MU and hyaluronidase (28.Rilla K. Tiihonen R. Kultti A. Tammi M. Tammi R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2008; 56: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, microvilli are thought to provide a scaffold to support the pericellular HA-matrix (28.Rilla K. Tiihonen R. Kultti A. Tammi M. Tammi R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2008; 56: 901-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The present results suggest that filopodia also can be dependent on HA-synthesis and pericellular HA. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the loss of filopodia and the change in cell shape are a consequence of FAK cleavage in response to the inhibition of HA synthesis. A likely candidate protease responsible for FAK degradation is calpain, which is involved in the physiological turnover of FAK and is also spatially associated with the focal adhesion complex (35.Carragher N.O. Fincham V.J. Riley D. Frame M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4270-4275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It has been shown that cross-talk exists between the HA matrix and focal adhesions. Using H-ras-transformed C3 fibroblasts, Hall et al. (1994) demonstrated that HA leads to FAK tyrosine phosphorylation and augmented the formation of focal adhesions (36.Hall C.L. Wang C. Lange L.A. Turley E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 575-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in osteosarcoma cells, HA stimulates the phosphorylation of FAK and ERK1/2 (20.Tofuku K. Yokouchi M. Murayama T. Minami S. Komiya S. Int. J. Oncol. 2006; 29: 175-183PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the previously observed link between CD44 and FAK activation (37.Bourguignon L.Y. Zhu H. Shao L. Chen Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1829-1838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 38.Fujita Y. Kitagawa M. Nakamura S. Azuma K. Ishii G. Higashi M. Kishi H. Hiwasa T. Koda K. Nakajima N. Harigaya K. FEBS Lett. 2002; 528: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), CD44 blocking antibodies had no influence on FAK degradation in ESCC. In contrast, the present results from down-regulation of RHAMM by shRNA and blocking RHAMM by antibodies strongly suggest that the loss of RHAMM signaling induces subsequent FAK degradation. In addition, interference with RHAMM signaling by shRNA and R36 led to decreased phosphorylation of Akt/PKB, whereas ERK phosphorylation was responsive only to shRHAMM. This difference between the use of the blocking antibody R36 and shRNA might point toward a role of intracellular RHAMM for ERK phosphorylation in OSC1. Inhibition of CD44 by both shRNA and Hermes1 antibody led to decreased phosphorylation of Akt/PKB and ERK1/2. These findings suggest that both HA receptors are involved in the observed inhibition of the signaling response after interference with HA synthesis. The inhibition of Akt/PKB and ERK 1/2 signaling likely also explains the inhibition of growth and migration in response to 4-MU, shHAS3, shHAS2, shCD44, and shRHAMM because the activation of the Ras-MAPK and PI3-kinase pathways by HA have been shown to mediate promigratory and proproliferative phenotypes (32.Itano N.

Interestingly, RHAMM is also a novel susceptibility gene for breast cancer, and its overexpression is positively correlated with the phosphorylation of ERK, metastasis, and poor survival for patients with breast cancer (42.Pujana M.A. Han J.D.

RHAMM peptide vaccination is currently being successfully explored in phase 1 clinical trials of acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma (44.Schmitt M. Schmitt A. Rojewski M.T. Chen J.

Blood. 2008; 111: 1357-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The relevance of RHAMM for esophageal cancer is further emphasized by a microarray analysis showing that RHAMM is highly induced in human ESCC cell lines and correlating RHAMM expression with the TNM Classification of Malignant Tumors (TNM) stage of human esophageal carcinoma (45.Yamano Y. Uzawa K. Shinozuka K. Fushimi K. Ishigami T. Nomura H. Ogawara K. Shiiba M. Yokoe H. Tanzawa H. Int. J. Oncol. 2008; 32: 1001-1009PubMed Google Scholar). All considered, in OSC1 cells interference with HA production, digestion of HA, displacement of HA, and inhibition of RHAMM signaling all cause FAK cleavage, suggesting a strong cross-talk between FA and hyaluronan/RHAMM. This might be important for these tumor cells to regulate adhesion, migration, and proliferation. In contrast, CD44 participates in hyaluronan-mediated signaling through Akt/PKB and ERK and through these pathways may contribute to the control of migration and proliferation but has no effect on FAK and cell shape. FAK mediates many crucial events in cancer cell biology and signaling, including spreading, proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis (46.Owens L.V. Xu L. Craven R.J. Dent G.A. Weiner T.M. Kornberg L. Liu E.T. Cance W.G. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2752-2755PubMed Google Scholar, 47.van Nimwegen M.J. van de Water B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 73: 597-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar); moreover, the promise of targeting FAK activity by antitumor therapy is supported by numerous studies. The novel interrelationship between HA/RHAMM and FAK turnover described here could therefore be important for a better understanding of these processes and for the development of new anticancer strategies.

Understanding the mechanisms underlying this vicious circle of inflammation is important to design better therapies for CF. We found in CF lung biopsies increased immunoreactivity for p38 MAPK activity markers. Moreover, when compared with their non-CF counterpart, airway epithelial cells expressing the most common mutation in CF (CFTRΔF508) were more potent at inducing neutrophil chemotaxis through increased interleukin (IL)-6 synthesis when challenged with Pseudomonas aeruginosa diffusible material. We then discovered that in CFTRΔF508 cells, the p38 and ERK MAPKs are hyperactivated in response to P. aeruginosa diffusible material, leading to increased IL-6 mRNA expression and stability. Moreover, although TLR5 contributes to p38 MAPK activation upon P. aeruginosa challenge, it only played a weak role in IL-6 synthesis. Instead, we found that the production of reactive oxygen species is essential for IL-6 synthesis in response to P. aeruginosa diffusible material. Finally, we uncovered that in CFTRΔF508 cells, the extracellular glutathione levels are decreased, leading to a greater sensitivity to reactive oxygen species, providing an explanation for the hyperactivation of the p38 and ERK MAPKs and increased IL-6 synthesis. Taken together, our study has characterized a mechanism whereby the CFTRΔF508 mutation in airway epithelial cells contributes to increase inflammation of the airways.

Cystic fibrosis is one of the most common fatal genetic diseases affecting Caucasians of European descent. It is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). 4The abbreviations used are: CFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorAECairway epithelial cellCFcystic fibrosisERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseILinterleukinJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseMAPKAP-K2MAPK-activated protein kinase 2NACN-acetyl-l-cysteineNF-κBnuclear factor-κBNODnucleotide-binding oligomerization domainROSreactive oxygen speciesTNFαtumor necrosis factor αTLRToll-like receptorELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Defective CFTR function in the airway epithelium is responsible for CF lung disease, the most life-threatening complication of CF, characterized by mucus hypersecretion and neutrophil-dominated inflammation. The proinflammatory cytokines, TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, and CXCL8 (Cys-Xaa-Cys chemokine ligand 8), are all found elevated in the airways of CF patients, with decreased levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (1.Kelley T.J.

Physiol. 1999; 276: C700-C710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections occur in 70% of the individuals at an early age and contribute to lung destruction and mortality. Moreover, CF patients suffer from exacerbation episodes, which have a profound effect on the patient's quality of life, where P. aeruginosa is the predominant pathogen found (3.Lyczak J.B.

CF pathogens activate common signaling pathways in airway epithelial cells, leading to the production of proinflammatory cytokines (5.Ratner A.J. Bryan R. Weber A. Nguyen S. Barnes D. Pitt A.

Human cells have evolved to recognize pathogens through receptors that bind different molecular patterns like lipids, carbohydrates, peptides, and nucleic acids expressed by various microorganisms. Once activated, these pattern recognition receptors trigger a network of intracellular signaling events leading to the production of inflammatory mediators. The two most studied pattern recognition receptor families are the TLR and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor families. There are currently 12 known mammalian TLRs and more than 20 NOD-like receptors (6.Fritz J.H. Ferrero R.L. Philpott D.J. Girardin S.E. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 7.O'Neill L.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2006; 18: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Our understanding of TLR-mediated signaling has progressed rapidly in the last few years. Following dimerization, TLRs bind different adaptor molecules through their Toll/IL-1 receptor domain (7.O'Neill L.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2006; 18: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The best characterized adaptor is MyD88 (myeloid differentiating factor 88), which was shown to, through the sequential recruitment of IL-1R-associated protein kinases (8.Muzio M. Ni J. Feng P.

Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar), serve as the template for the activation of four major signaling pathways: the NF-κB pathway and the three MAPK pathways (ERK1/ERK2, JNK, and p38 MAPK). The NOD receptors bind through their caspase recruitment domains to a protein kinase termed RIP2 (receptor-interacting protein 2; also called RICK or CARDIAK) (13.Kufer T.A. Kremmer E. Banks D.J. Philpott D.J. Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 3115-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), which will initiate downstream signaling via the recruitment of TAK1 and activation of the IκB protein kinase complex (14.Inohara Chamaillard McDonald C. Nuñez G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 355-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar, 15.Windheim M. Lang C. Peggie M. Plater L.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). p38 MAPK was initially recognized for its role regulating the biosynthesis of proinflammatory cytokines, namely IL-1 and TNFα, in endotoxin-stimulated monocytes (16.Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Nature. 1994; 372: 739-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (3138) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was found to be involved in regulating the production of CXCL8 (also known as IL-8) in response to IL-1 (17.Shapiro L. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 12230-12234Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and the production of IL-6 in response to TNFα (18.Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). p38α is thought to be the main isoform involved in mediating cytokine production because mice lacking p38β, the most closely related isoform, show no defect in cytokine production or immune function (19.Beardmore V.A. Hinton H.J. Eftychi C. Apostolaki M. Armaka M. Darragh J. McIlrath J. Carr J.M. Armit L.J. Clacher C. Malone L. Kollias G. Arthur J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 10454-10464Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In view of its critical role in the synthesis of TNFα, IL-1, IL-6, and CXCL8, p38 MAPK is a major contributor to inflammation and may play a critical role in the inflamed lung of cystic fibrosis patients. Therefore, we investigated the role of p38α MAPK in mediating proinflammatory cytokine production in airway epithelial cells expressing the most common mutation found in CF, CFTRΔF508 (20.White M.B. Amos J. Hsu J.M. Gerrard B. Finn P. Dean M. Nature. 1990; 344: 665-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Patients harboring the CFTRΔF508 mutation lack CFTR expression at the membrane due to misfolding, which leads to the protein being degraded instead of transported to the cell surface (21.Cheng S.H.

IRDyeTM 800CW-conjugated Streptavidin (S000-31) was bought from Rockland (Gilbertville, PA). Five-micrometer-thick sections from endobronchial biopsy of healthy adult subjects (non-CF) or from explanted lung of subjects with cystic fibrosis undergoing lung transplantation (CF) were graciously provided by Dr. James G. Martin (Meakins-Christie Laboratories, Montréal, Canada). All patients gave written informed consent, as approved by the hospital ethics committee. Slides were deparaffinated in xylene and rehydrated in decreasing concentrations of alcohol. For staining, heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed using EDTA buffer, pH 8.0. Sections were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton and incubated with 5% hydrogen peroxide. After blocking with universal blocking solution for 30 min (Dakocytomation, Mississauga, Canada), slides were incubated overnight with 1:50 dilutions of HSP27 phospho-Ser82 (catalog no. 2401, Cell Signaling Technologies) or MAPKAP-K2 phospho-Thr334 antibodies (catalog no. 3007, Cell Signaling Technologies). Isotype controls were prepared by replacing the primary antibody with a nonspecific Ig at the same concentration. After rinsing, the slides were incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibodies (1:100), followed by a horseradish peroxidase-antibody complex (both from Dakocytomation). Immunoreactivity was developed with diaminobenzidine chromogen (Dakocytomation), and slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and lithium carbonate. We used RayBio Human Inflammation Antibody Array 3 to screen a panel of 40 different proteins being secreted in the cell media. One milliliter of cell supernatant was incubated with each membrane according to the manufacturer's protocol. The signal was revealed using IRDyeTM 800CW-conjugated Streptavidin (1 μg/ml), and fluorescence was detected and quantified using a Licor Odyssey imaging system. Human airway epithelial cell line NuLi was derived from a normal lung of a 36-year-old male patient by dual retroviral infection to prevent cells undergoing growth arrest in cell culture. The CuFi airway epithelial cell line was derived from lung of a 14-year-old female patient with cystic fibrosis by the same method and is homozygous for the CFTRΔF508 mutation. These cells were purchased from the ATCC or, alternatively, generously provided by Dr. Emmanuelle Brochiero (Centre de Recherche, Hôtel-Dieu du CHUM, Université de Montréal, Canada). They were used until passage 17. The cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2, 100% humidity, in Bronchial Epithelial Growth Medium (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with growth factors (SingleQuots (Lonza), except gentamicin), 50 units/ml penicillin G, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml geneticin, and 2 μg/ml amphotericin B. Neutrophil migration assays were performed using a modified Boyden chamber (Transwell, Fisher) with 5-μm pores. The conditioned medium of treated AECs was added to the lower chamber, whereas the upper chamber was filled with untreated medium. To determine the role of IL-6, supernatants were first incubated for 1 h at room temperature with neutralizing antibodies against IL-6 (50 μg/ml) before adding supernatants to the lower chamber. Neutrophils (0.5 × 106) suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were put into the upper well, and the chamber was placed in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2 for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells located on the upper surface of the membrane were scraped with a cotton swab, and the cells that crossed the polycarbonate filter were collected from the lower compartment and counted with a hemacytometer. The same experiment was performed by adding recombinant human IL-6 (200 pg/well) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to the lower chamber instead of conditioned medium. Human IL-6 (DY206) DuoSet ELISA kits was purchased from R&D Systems. 100 μl of supernatant collected after cell stimulation was directly used for IL-6 quantification according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA was quantified, and 1 μg was treated with DNase I Amp Grade (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocols. Semiquantitative real-time PCR was performed in 96-well plate format using SYBR Green-based detection on a Step-One-Plus machine (ABI) with each 10-μl reaction containing ∼50 ng of cDNA, 0.3 μm sense and antisense primers (Table 1), and 1× Quantitect SYBR Green supermix (Qiagen). The plate was sealed and cycled under the following conditions: 95 °C for 10 min, 50 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, and 60 °C for 45 s. Each reaction was performed in duplicate, mRNA levels of GAPDH were used for normalization, and -fold induction was determined from Ct values using the Pfaffl method (23.Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: e45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25582) Google Scholar). PCR efficiencies were determined from the slope of a standard curve generated using a 5-fold dilution series of the DNA template.TABLE 1Primer sequences Measurement of mRNA stability was performed as described previously (24.Rousseau S. Morrice N. Peggie M. Campbell D.G. Gaestel M. Cohen P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6505-6514Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were first stimulated with P. aeruginosa filtrates as specified, and transcription was blocked by the addition of 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (380-009-M005; Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA). At the times indicated in the figure legends, total RNA was extracted following the addition of actinomycin D (referred as time 0). Following stimulation, cells were lysed in ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton x-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.27 m sucrose, complete miniprotease inhibitor mixture, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). Proteins were quantified using the Bradford method, and 20 μg of lysates were submitted to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with specified antibodies. The signal was detected and quantified using a Licor Odyssey imaging system. GSH levels were measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (Arbor Assays). Briefly, cells were stimulated with P. aeruginosa filtrates (3 h), and the supernatant was collected. Total GSH was detected by the color change at 405 nm. GSH levels were quantified using standards of GSSG with and without 2-vinylpyridine and expressed as GSSG equivalents. GSH levels were calculated from the difference between total GSH and GSSG. Analyses of variance followed by a multiple comparison test (Bonferroni) were used to test differences in mean between groups. p values of <0.05 were considered significant. We first sought to determine if there was activation of the p38 MAPK pathway in the lungs of CF patients. We therefore stained for the phosphorylated form of the small heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27) (25.Rouse J. Cohen P. Trigon S. Morange M. Alonso-Llamazares A. Zamanillo D. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R. Cell. 1994; 78: 1027-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar), a substrate of the p38 MAPK-activated protein kinase MAPKAP-K2. We found positive staining of phosphorylated HSP27 (phospho-Ser82) when compared with IgG control staining in airway epithelial cells of a cystic fibrosis patient (Fig. 1). Moreover, we also observed staining for the phosphorylated form of MAPKAP-K2 (phospho-Thr334) (Fig. 1) in the same patient. In accordance with the known predominant locations of phosphorylated MAPKAP-K2 and HSP27, the first was seen in the nucleus, whereas the latter was observed mostly in the cytoplasm (see insets in Fig. 1). In comparison, very little staining for the phosphorylated forms of HSP27 and MAPKAP-K2 was seen on a biopsy of a healthy lung (Fig. 1). These results indicate that the p38 MAPK pathway is more activated in the airway epithelium of CF patients. As mentioned in the Introduction, these patients suffer from chronic infections, mostly from the Gram-negative bacteria P. aeruginosa. Bacteria present in the lungs of CF patients are found mostly as intraluminal masses distal from airway epithelial cells (26.Baltimore R.S. Christie C.D. Smith G.J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1989; 140: 1650-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Therefore, diffusible P. aeruginosa products may represent a more accurate reflection of the pathogenic factors encountered by AECs rather than live organisms. Filtrates of late stationary phase P. aeruginosa (a mucoid clinical isolate) were prepared to stimulate bronchial airway epithelial cells. We first confirmed that p38 MAPK was phosphorylated by exposure of airway epithelial cells to the P. aeruginosa filtrates using immunoblotting (supplemental Fig. 1). We then checked which inflammatory mediators were synthesized in a p38α MAPK-dependent fashion by AECs in response to bacterial infection. In order to identify inflammatory mediators up-regulated by P. aeruginosa filtrates in AECs expressing wild-type CFTR (NuLi) or CFTRΔF508 (CuFi), an array of 40 secreted proteins was screened (Fig. 2A). The role of p38 MAPK was assayed using two structurally distinct and relatively specific inhibitors of this protein kinase, namely SB203580 (16.Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F.

Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar) and BIRB0796 (28.Kuma Y. Sabio G. Bain J. Shpiro N. Márquez R. Cuenda A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19472-19479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). SB203580 potently inhibits p38 MAPK but is also known to inhibit with similar potency RIP2 (29.Godl K. Wissing J. Kurtenbach A. Habenberger P. Blencke S. Gutbrod H. Salassidis K. Stein-Gerlach M. Missio A. Cotten M. Daub H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 15434-15439Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), a protein kinase involved in transmitting signals from the NOD1 and NOD2 pattern recognition receptors (see Introduction). BIRB0796 is an even more potent inhibitor of p38 MAPK and does not inhibit RIP2, making it useful to differentiate the effects mediated by RIP2 from those mediated by p38 MAPK (15.Windheim M. Lang C. Peggie M. Plater L.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2007; 404: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 28.Kuma Y. Sabio G. Bain J. Shpiro N. Márquez R. Cuenda A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19472-19479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Screening of the array identified IL-6, CXCL8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and LTα as p38 MAPK-dependent genes induced by P. aeruginosa filtrates in non-CF or CFTRΔF508 AECs (Fig. 2B). Moreover, in the CFTRΔF508 cells, a striking increase of IL-6 was seen upon stimulation with P. aeruginosa filtrates compared with wild-type CFTR-expressing cells (Fig. 2B). In order to determine whether the observed increase in IL-6 secretion by AECs expressing CFTRΔF508 had a biological impact, we tested the capacity of conditioned medium from these cells to stimulate neutrophil migration. When fresh human neutrophils isolated from peripheral blood were exposed to P. aeruginosa filtrate-stimulated CFTRΔF508 AECs medium, their migration was greater than when they were exposed to the non-CF medium (Fig. 3A). To determine the contribution of IL-6 to this neutrophil chemotactic activity, we blocked its action in the conditioned medium using a neutralizing antibody. We found that blocking IL-6 activity brought the migration of neutrophil in response to the CFTRΔF508 medium back to same level as that observed in non-CF cells (Fig. 3A). We also tested whether IL-6 had a direct impact on neutrophil migration as reported for monocytes (30.Yang H.T. Cohen P. Rousseau S. Cell. Signal. 2008; 20: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Exposure of neutrophils to recombinant human IL-6 at a concentration detected in the CFTRΔF508 AEC medium was sufficient to increase the motility of these cells (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these results clearly implicate IL-6 as a direct actor of neutrophil recruitment by AECs. In order to understand why there was such an increased production of IL-6 in cells lacking functional CFTR, we first looked at the mRNA expression of IL-6 in both NuLi and CuFi cells treated with P. aeruginosa filtrates. Increased levels of IL-6 mRNA were detected at all times, measured by real-time PCR (Fig. 4A). The induction of IL-6 mRNA by P. aeruginosa filtrates was dependent on both the p38 and ERK MAPKs because inhibition of both these pathways impaired this production in the two cell types (Fig. 4B). This is in accordance with previous results obtained for CXCL8 in airway epithelial cells stimulated by TLR agonists (31.Bérubé J. Bourdon C. Yao Y. Rousseau S. Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This, however, does not preclude a role for other pathways, like that of NF-κB, as previously shown (31.Bérubé J. Bourdon C. Yao Y. Rousseau S. Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 448-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We then determined the secreted levels of IL-6 in the media by ELISA. Much higher basal and induced levels were found in the media of the CFTRΔF508 cells compared with wild-type AECs (Fig. 4C). In accordance with the data obtained with the IL-6 mRNA, inhibition of both p38 and ERK MAPKs pathways led to a reduction of secreted IL-6 in P. aeruginosa filtrate-stimulated cells, which was more pronounced in wild-type cells than the CFTRΔF508-expressing AECS (Fig. 4D). Moreover, these two pathways also played a role in regulating the basal levels of IL-6 because their inhibition reduced the amount of IL-6 mRNA present in unstimulated CFTRΔF508 cells (supplemental Fig. 2). A role for p38 MAPK in the post-transcriptional regulation of IL-6 has been previously reported (32.Neininger A. Kontoyiannis D. Kotlyarov A. Winzen R. Eckert R. Volk H.D. Holtmann H. Kollias G. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3065-3068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate the mRNA stability of IL-6 in P. aeruginosa filtrate-stimulated AECs. Strikingly, we found that in CFTRΔF508 cells treated with P. aeruginosa filtrates, the mRNA of IL-6 was much more stable than in the non-CF cells (Fig. 4E). These results further explain why there is more IL-6 protein made because the turnover rate of the IL-6 mRNA is much longer in the absence of functional CFTR expression, a very surprising result. We further established that when p38 MAPK activity is blocked with a pharmacological inhibitor, BIRB0796, the IL-6 mRNA instability is partially restored (Fig. 4E). The previous results suggested that the p38 MAPK plays a key role in this phenotype. We therefore looked at the activation of p38 MAPK induced by the presence of P. aeruginosa filtrates in both non-CF and CFTRΔF508 AECs. We found that in cells lacking functional expression of CFTR, p38 MAPK activity was increased when compared with cells expressing CFTR at the membrane (Fig. 5A). However, this increased activation was not specific to the p38 MAPK because increased activation in CFTRΔF508 cells was also observed for ERK MAPKs (Fig. 5B). These results suggest that the increased activation is occurring upstream of MAPK activation. In order to further dissect where this increased activation is occurring, we compared IL-6 synthesis in response to pattern recognition receptor or cytokine receptor stimulation of AECs. Non-CF and CFTRΔF508 cells were stimulated with the following pattern recognition receptor agonists: a triacylated synthetic lipoprotein (Pam3CSK4) that activates TLR1/TLR2; lipopolysaccharide from P. aeruginosa that activates TLR4; flagellin from Salmonella typhimurium that activates TLR5; or C12-ie-DAP an acylated derivative of the dipeptide γ-d-Glu-mDAP, present in the peptidoglycan of bacteria, that activates the intracellular receptor NOD1. The cells were also stimulated with IL-17A, a cytokine driving neutrophil recruitment to inflamed areas via the synthesis of CXCL8 by signaling pathways analogous to TLRs (33.Liu C. Qian W. Qian Y. Giltiay N.V. Lu Y. Swaidani S. Misra S. Deng L. Chen Z.J. Li X. Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: ra63Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The CFTRΔF508-expressing cells only showed increased secretion of IL-6 in response to pattern recognition receptor activation but not IL-17A stimulation (Fig. 6). Because the greatest increases in IL-6 synthesis were seen in response to agonists of TLR2 and TLR5 in Fig. 6, we sought to determine if these two receptors were crucial links to MAPK activation and IL-6 synthesis by P. aer"
https://openalex.org/W2092856980,"Mutations in presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 (PS1 and PS2) are the most common cause of familial Alzheimer disease. PS1 and PS2 are the presumptive catalytic components of the multisubunit gamma-secretase complex, which proteolyzes a number of type I transmembrane proteins, including the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Notch. APP processing by gamma-secretase produces beta-amyloid peptides (Abeta40 and Abeta42) that accumulate in the Alzheimer disease brain. Here we identify a pathogenic L435F mutation in PS1 in two affected siblings with early-onset familial Alzheimer disease characterized by deposition of cerebral cotton wool plaques. The L435F mutation resides in a conserved C-terminal PAL sequence implicated in active site conformation and catalytic activity. The impact of PS1 mutations in and around the PAL motif on gamma-secretase activity was assessed by expression of mutant PS1 in mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking endogenous PS1 and PS2. Surprisingly, the L435F mutation caused a nearly complete loss of gamma-secretase activity, including >90% reductions in the generation of Abeta40, Abeta42, and the APP and Notch intracellular domains. Two nonpathogenic PS1 mutations, P433L and L435R, caused essentially complete loss of gamma-secretase activity, whereas two previously identified pathogenic PS1 mutations, P436Q and P436S, caused partial loss of function with substantial reductions in production of Abeta40, Abeta42, and the APP and Notch intracellular domains. These results argue against overproduction of Abeta42 as an essential property of presenilin proteins bearing pathogenic mutations. Rather, our findings provide support for the hypothesis that pathogenic mutations cause a general loss of presenilin function."
https://openalex.org/W2077293025,"Mu-opioid receptor regulates microRNA-190 (miR-190) in an agonist-dependent manner; fentanyl, but not morphine, decreases the miR-190 level in rat primary hippocampal neuron cultures and in mouse hippocampi. In this study, the correlation between the cellular content of miR-190 and the mRNA level of its host gene, talin2, suggested that fentanyl decreases the miR-190 level by inhibiting the transcription of talin2. Fentanyl-induced beta-arrestin2-mediated ERK phosphorylation led to the phosphorylation of Yin Yang 1 (YY1). In addition, YY1 phosphorylation impaired the association of YY1 with the -208 to -200 region on the Talin2 promoter, and this association was essential for YY1 to stimulate the transcription of talin2. Thus, fentanyl decreased the transcription of talin2 and subsequently the cellular level of miR-190 by inducing YY1 phosphorylation. In contrast, because morphine induces ERK phosphorylation via the protein kinase C pathway, morphine did not induce YY1 phosphorylation and had no effect on the transcription of talin2 and the cellular content of miR-190. This study therefore delineates a signaling pathway that mediates the effects of fentanyl on miR-190 expression."

Molecular targeting of contrast and therapeutic agents to tumors is a fundamental goal of cancer research and treatment. Targeting based on tumor-specific molecules has largely relied on binding of antibodies, peptides, or vitamins to antigens or receptors expressed at high levels on tumor cells or their associated vasculature. The drawback to such mechanisms is that they rely on stoichiometric binding that lacks amplification, so either the target must be very highly expressed, or the readout must be extremely sensitive.

Before cleavage of the linker, the polyanion pairs with the polycation and prevents cell adhesion and internalization; after cleavage, the polyanion dissociates, unleashing the cell-penetrating peptide to adhere immediately to adjacent cells, followed by cellular internalization. The first ACPPs were designed to be activated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are frequently up-regulated in tumors and play a crucial role in extracellular matrix degradation, tissue invasion, and metastasis (10.Bremer C.

Although an MMP-activated ACPP has been shown to effectively target tumors in vivo, this rational design of an ACPP is limited by the availability of known protease substrates and the tissue specific expression of the target protease. For instance, there is currently no known peptide substrate that is perfectly selective for MMPs, and no MMP is exclusively expressed in tumors. Therefore, to improve the applicability of ACPPs, it is important to explore other classes of proteases and substrates with methods that might provide greater specificity and flexibility than a priori design. activatable cell-penetrating peptide matrix metalloproteinase standardized uptake value N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl 6-aminohexanoyl N,N,N′,N-tetrakis (2-pyridylmethyl) ethylenediamine nitrilotriacetic acid phosphate-buffered saline polyomavirus middle T antigen high pressure liquid chromatography N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine green fluorescent protein maleimide diethylene triamine pentacetic acid.

In this report, we have used phage display to identify peptides that accumulate within tumors in vivo as a result of proteolytic modification. This method identifies novel protease substrates that are cleaved within tumors without bias for class of protease or specific substrate sequence. To examine the efficacy of this approach, we performed parallel in vivo and in vitro selections with phage displaying a library of unique ACPPs. For in vivo selection, phage were injected into tumor-bearing mice followed by isolation of cleaved phage from homogenized tumors. For in vitro selection, phage were sequentially exposed to normal versus tumor tissue extract, followed by isolation of uncleaved or cleaved phage, respectively. Phage selected ACPPs were resynthesized as fluorescently labeled peptides, injected into tumor-bearing mice, and shown to accumulate within primary and metastatic tumors in a protease-dependent manner. A phage library was generated by PCR, using 5′-primer ggccaagagctccatcatcatcatcatcatctc, 3′-primer ggccagactagtccgtcgccgtcgccgtcg, and oligonucleotide template ccatcatcatcatcatcatctcgaggaggaggaggaggaggaggaggagnnknnknnknnknnknnkcggcgacggcgacggcgacggcgacggactag, where n denotes any nucleotide and k indicates a mixture of g and t. PCR was performed for 25 cycles with 52 °C annealing and standard reaction conditions. PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes SpeI and SacI for directional cloning into pComb M13 phage expression vector (17.Barbas 3rd, C.F. Kang A.S. Lerner R.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 7978-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). The phage library contained 5 × 106 primary transformants, which were converted to infectious phage using helper phage superinfection. Phage libraries were then titered by infection of XL1blu cells and plated on ampicillin plates. For in vitro selections, 109 phage were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with mixed liver/kidney tissue extracts equivalent to 2% (2 mg of each tissue per 100 μl). Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) was added and incubated for 15 min, followed by three washes with PBS. The Ni2+-NTA-agarose coupled to the uncleaved phage was then exposed to 2% tumor tissue extract at 37 °C for 3 h. Unbound cleaved phage were eluted from the Ni2+-NTA with PBS and plated on XL1blue E. coli to recover phage. For in vivo selections, 109 phage in 100 μl of PBS were injected into the tail veins of 10–13-week-old transgenic mice that had 5–15-mm mammary tumors due to expression of PyMT driven by the long terminal repeat of mouse mammary tumor virus. Tumors were excised and homogenized in PBS in the presence of protease inhibitor containing 100 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride-HCl, 80 nm aprotinin, 5 μm bestatin, 1.5 μm E-64, 2 μm leupeptin hemisulfate, and 1 μm pepstatin A (EMD Biosciences mixture III). Uncleaved phage were removed by absorption with Ni2+-NTA-agarose, and cleaved phage from the supernatant were reamplified and reinjected into different PyMT tumor-bearing mice. Peptides were either obtained from the W. M. Keck Facility Small Scale Core (Yale University, New Haven, CT) or synthesized in our laboratory on a Perceptive Biosystems Pioneer automatic peptide synthesizer using standard protocols for Fmoc solid-phase synthesis. All peptides were of the general format N terminus-(d-glutamyl)9-(6-aminohexanoyl)-(6-amino acid cleavage site)-(d-argininyl)9-(either Cy5-d-cysteinamide or ϵ-(fluorescein-5(6)-carbonyl)-l-lysinamide) (see supplemental Fig. 1 for complete details). Carboxyfluorescein-labeled peptides were generated by Fmoc synthesis with Lys-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein and were acetylated at the N terminus. Albumin-reactive peptide, Mal-e9-ahx-RLQLK(Ac)L-r9-c(Cy5)-NH2, was generated by reacting 3-maleimidopropionic acid pentafluorophenyl ester (Molecular Biosciences) with the free N terminus of Cy5-labeled peptide (see supplemental Fig. 1 for detailed structures of all peptides). The negative control maleimide (Mal) peptide had -NH(CH2CH2O)2CH2CO-, an uncleavable (mpeg) linker (4.Aguilera T.A. Olson E.S. Timmers M.M. Jiang T. Tsien R.Y. Integrative Biology. 2009; 1: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), in place of the 6-aminohexanoyl and substrate sequence. All Cy5-labeled peptides were purified to greater than 95% purity using C-18 reverse phase HPLC with a 20–50% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% TFA and the mass was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Tissue extracts were generated by dissecting fresh tissue and gently homogenizing in PBS, while on ice, to minimize the release of intracellular proteases. Homogenates were then microcentrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 min, and supernatants were recovered and used for in vitro testing. All cystic fluids were aspirated with a 28-gauge syringe from surgically exposed mammary tumors of PyMT mice containing fluid filled nodules. In vitro cleavages were done with 5 μm peptide in 20 μl of PBS containing 1 μm ZnCl2 plus 2 μl of 20% tissue extract (20 mg of tissue homogenate per 100 μl) or 2 μl of undiluted cystic fluid, followed by incubation at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed at time intervals from 20 min to 18 h with data being shown for the 2-h time point. For cleavage with purified enzymes, a 50 nm concentration of each enzyme was incubated with 5 μm peptide in the manufacturer's recommended buffer for 4 h. Enzymes and inhibitors were obtained from commercial sources in their active form (a complete table of enzymes and inhibitors is shown in supplemental Fig. 2). Tricine sample buffer was added, and treated peptides were boiled for 1 min prior to electrophoresis on 10–20% Tricine acrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Gels were quantitatively imaged on a UVP Biospectrum AC imaging system with external Biolite light source with excitation at 628 ± 20 nm and emission at >700 nm. Quantitation of enzyme cleavage was done using UVP Biospectrum software. For mass spectrometry determination, each peptide was purified from homogenized cell extract by two steps of reverse phase HPLC. A 30-μl sample of 5 μm ACPP digested with tissue extract for 2 h was diluted to 2.5 ml with solvent A, which contained 2% acetonitrile and 0.14% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples were immediately injected into a Dionex BioLC HPLC system. The autosampler (Gilson model 231) had a 2-ml sample loop, so two 1-ml injections were used for each HPLC chromatogram. The column was a protein C4 from Vydac with a 4.6-mm inner diameter and 25-cm length. The column temperature was 35 °C, and the flow rate was 0.8 ml/min. After an 11-min delay (12% solvent B) for the injections, the gradient was from 12 to 56% solvent B (90% acetonitrile, 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid) in 11 min, followed by a 3-min step of 80% B. The peak eluted at 20 min. Detection was by fluorescence (Dionex RF2000 fluorescence detector, excitation at 640 nm, and emission at 680 nm), and the peak was collected with a Gilson FC203 fraction collector. For the second step of reverse phase HPLC, the fraction was reconcentrated to 200 μl by centrifuge evaporation (Savant SpeedVac) and then diluted to 600 μl with solvent A again. A Michrom Magic HPLC system was used for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and the column output was detected by a Jasco 920 fluorescence detector and an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer. A Michrom sample loop microtrap was used to preconcentrate the entire 600-μl sample for injection. The column was a 1-mm inner diameter, 15-cm Michrom C18AQ, and the fluorescence detector settings were similar to those in the first step. The solvents, column temperature, and gradient were also similar, and the flow rate was 80 μl/min. The MS was set for ∼0.5-s scans with the high resolution Orbitrap from 400 to 2000 m/z. The entire column output went into the mass spectrometer without splitting, using the electrospray interface. For each tumor model, Cy5-labeled peptide was injected intravenously via the tail vein. Mice were imaged at time intervals up to 6 h using a Maestro imager (CRI Inc.) with excitation at 640 ± 24 nm, emission at >700 nm. For in vivo testing, we used either PyMT mice with spontaneous progressive mammary tumors or nude mice with 5–7-mm MDA-MB-435 clone M4A4 (gift of D. Tarin, UCSD) xenograft tumors generated by subcutaneous injection of 106 tumor cells into the mammary fat pads (mice 5–8 weeks of age; Charles Rivers Laboratories). Animals were anesthetized with a 1:1 mixture of 80 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg midazolam, weighed, and injected with 100 μl of 100 μm free peptides or 100 μl of 30 μm albumin-reactive peptide. After imaging, the animals were euthanized with isoflurane, and tissues were harvested and weighed for standardized uptake values (SUVs). To measure SUVs, 30 mg of each tissue was added to 100 μl of Tris buffer (pH 7.6) with 1% SDS. The tissue was homogenized, heated to 85 °C for 10 min, microwaved for 10 s, centrifuged at 20,500 × g for 15 min, and imaged on the Maestro imager. Four sets of tissue-specific standards (tumor, liver, kidney, and muscle from non-injected animals, added to known amounts of ACPP and processed as above) were used to calibrate fluorescence intensity in terms of peptide concentration. Tissue-specific standards were necessary because different tissues vary in their ability to quench or conceal Cy5 fluorescence. From this calibration, the quantity of peptide in 30 mg of tissue for each organ was calculated. SUVs were calculated as the molality of peptide in the tissue divided by the total injected dose as mol/kg of body weight. In previous experiments with the MMP-cleavable ACPP, SUVs determined using this method were similar to SUVs determined using technetium chelates (1.Jiang T. Olson E.S. Nguyen Q.T. Roy M.

Means are given ± S.D.; statistical significance of differences was determined by two-tailed t tests. To generate mice with lung metastases, 5 × 105 4T1 tumor cells (ATCC) were injected into the tail veins of BALB/c mice 8 days prior to injection with imaging agent. Lungs were removed and imaged either 6 or 48 h postinjection, depending on the peptide construct. Average fluorescent intensity was determined for metastatic lung nodules and compared with adjacent non-malignant tissue or lungs from a tumor-bearing animal that had no lung metastases. We analyzed nine selected regions of 80–200 pixels of each type of tissue, and all tissues were imaged using identical parameters. In order to generate a phage library displaying ACPPs, amino acid sequences of the format Met-His6-E9-X6-R9 (where X6 represents 6 randomized amino acids) were fused to the N terminus (0–4 copies per phage) of a truncated form of the M13 phage gIII coat protein (17.Barbas 3rd, C.F. Kang A.S. Lerner R.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 7978-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 22.Sidhu S.S. Biomol. Eng. 2001; 18: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This library contained 5 × 106 putative protease cleavage sites as determined by primary colony-forming units after helper phage infection and dispersal on plates containing antibiotics. This represents about 8% of the potential diversity of 6.4 × 107 for X6. The X6 region of the library was generated using NNK(G/T) degenerate oligonucleotides. A hexahistidine motif was added at the N terminus to allow separation by immobilized metal affinity chromatography of unmodified phage from phage whose peptides had been cleaved releasing the hexahistidine tag. In vivo selections were performed by injecting a library of phage displaying recombinant ACPPs intravenously into PyMT mice (Fig. 1). This transgenic breast cancer model produces spontaneous heterogeneous tumors, which can be cystic and will progress to metastasis in older animals (23.Guy C.T. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 954-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar, 24.Lin E.Y. Jones J.G. Li P. Zhu L. Whitney K.D. Muller W.J. Pollard J.W. Am. J.

Six hours after injection, animals were sacrificed, and their tumors were dissected out and homogenized in the presence of protease inhibitors to prevent secondary cleavage of contained phage. Uncleaved phage in the tumor vasculature or nonspecifically localized to tumor at the time of dissection were removed by absorption with Ni2+-NTA-conjugated agarose. This purification step was necessary because, as previously reported, phage particles can be retained for long periods in tissues even in the absence of any selection (26.Zou J. Dickerson M.T. Owen N.K. Landon L.A. Deutscher S.L. Mol. Biol. Rep. 2004; 31: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Purified phage that had been cleaved within the mouse were reamplified and injected into different PyMT tumor-bearing mice. This selection was continued for seven iterative cycles with 10–15 individual phage clones being sampled by DNA isolation and sequencing after each round of selection. Five sequences, RLQLKL, RTRYED, RIPLEM, QFDEPR, and TSAVRT, were each isolated multiple times during the in vivo selection (Table 1).TABLE 1Phage sequences identified by in vivo or in vitro selection and cleavage of derived peptides by PyMT tumor tissue extractsCleavage site (X6)In vivo number isolatedin vitro number isolatedCleavage of e9-X6-r9 peptide by tumor extract%RLQLKL211>90RTRYED3>90RIPLEM3<10QFDEPR3<10TSAVRT2NTGLWQGP7∼20QCTGRF15NTLPGMMG5∼20DVGTTE5No cleavageTDLGAM5No cleavageGMMYRS4>90DSNAES4No cleavageITDMAA13∼20RWRTNF4>90WRPCES12NTWRNTIA3∼50IDKQLE3<5FMEIET3<5HEVVAG2NTGGHTRQ2NTINGKVT2NT Open table in a new tab For in vitro selection, the ACPP phage library was pre-exposed to extracts of liver and kidney, tissues that typically have high nonspecific uptake of drugs and imaging agent, to allow cleavage by proteases contained within these extracts. Ni2+-agarose was then used to isolate uncleaved phage that had retained their hexahistidine tags. These preselected phage were then exposed to PyMT tumor extracts and selected for peptide cleavage and loss of their hexahistidine tags. Isolated phage were reamplified and subjected to six additional rounds of both negative (no liver/kidney cleavage) and positive (tumor cleavage) selection, with representative phage being isolated and sequenced after each round. This in vitro selection identified five sequences isolated in the in vivo selection scheme as well 15 additional sequences (Table 1). Only one sequence, RLQLKL, was identified in duplicate in both the in vivo and in vitro selection schemes. To test if isolated peptides corresponding to the phage-selected sequence could be proteolytically cleaved by tumor tissue extracts, 14 of the 21 selected phage sequences were synthesized as peptides in the format acetyl-e9-(ahx)-X6-r9-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-labeled l-lysinamide using solid-phase synthesis (for complete structures, see supplemental Fig. 1). The (ahx) denotes 6-aminohexanoyl, a flexible linker that is included in ACPPs to give the cleavable X6 domain the ability to adopt a more extended conformation within the protease cleavage domain. The polyglutamate and polyarginine segments consisted entirely of d-amino acids (denoted by lowercase letters) in order to maximize their resistance to proteolysis in vivo. Four peptides, containing X6 = RLQLKL, RTRYED, GMMYRS, and RWRTNF, were cleaved >80% by tumor tissue extract after 16-h digestions at 37 °C (Table 1). These top four peptides were resynthesized in the format H2N-e9-(ahx)-X6-r9-(Cy5-labeled d-cysteinamide), followed by purification to greater than 95% for in vitro and in vivo testing. Each of these peptides was tested for differential cleavage by tumor versus mixed liver/kidney tissue extracts after a 2-h digestion compared with the 16-h digestion shown in Table 1 (Fig. 2A). All four peptides were cleaved >50% by tumor tissue extract, with RLQLKL being the most rapidly cleaved, >90% after 4 h (full time course not shown). Each peptide except for GMMYRS showed increased cleavage by tumor extract relative to mixed liver/kidney extracts. A control peptide with all d-amino acids, X6 = rlqlkl, was not cleaved by any of the tissue extracts. In order to compare in vivo tumor labeling, these four Cy5-labeled ACPPs were separately injected intravenously into PyMT mice with spontaneous mammary tumors. Six hours postinjection, mice were imaged by fluorescence to show contrast of tumor compared with adjacent normal tissue. The most striking visual contrast for tumor uptake was obtained from mice injected with the RLQLKL ACPP (Fig. 2B). Consistent with this high visual contrast, the SUVs in the tumor, defined as the molality of Cy5 in the specific tissue divided by the molality of the injected dose for the total weight of the animal, was the highest for the RLQLKL ACPP at 0.39 ± 0.14 (n = 8). This compared with the uncleavable all-d-amino acid peptide, rlqlkl ACPP, which had a SUV of 0.13 ± 0.03 (n = 3) with p = 0.014. The decreased tumor accumulation in the mice injected with the uncleavable d-amino acid probe of identical molecular weight and hydrophobicity strongly suggests that tumor uptake is dependent on protease susceptibility rather than nonspecific adhesion or enhanced vascular permeability of tumors. This ratio of 3 between protease-sensitive and relatively insensitive peptides compares with a ratio of 3.6 for our previous ACPP, in which X6 = PLGLAG and targets matrix metalloproteinases (1.Jiang T. Olson E.S. Nguyen Q.T. Roy M. Jennings P.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 2004; 101: 17867-17872Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). PLGLAG ACPP had SUV values of 0.51 ± 0.05 (n = 5) versus 0.14 ± 0.06 (n = 5), p < 0.01, for its d-amino acid control. As with all free peptide ACPPs, there is labeling of cartilaginous portions of the anterior ribcage (4.Aguilera T.A. Olson E.S. Timmers M.M. Jiang T. Tsien R.Y. Integrative Biology. 2009; 1: 371-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 5.Olson E.S. Aguilera T.A. Jiang T. Ellies L.G. Nguyen Q.T. Wong E.H. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Integrative Biology. 2009; 1: 382-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). One advantage of RLQLKL ACPP versus PLGLAG ACPP is that skin uptake was significantly less, improving contrast during noninvasive visualization in live animals (see supplemental Fig. 3 for images). To explore whether RLQLKL ACPP could be used as a contrast agent for tumor models other than the PyMT mice, Cy5-labeled RLQLKL ACPP and its all-d-amino acid control were tested in mice bearing MDA-MB-435 M4A4 human xenografts. This tumor model (also known as M14 melanoma (27.Lacroix M. Int. J. Cancer. 2008; 122: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar)) was stably transfected with GFP for unambiguous identification of xenograft versus host tissue. Tumors of mice injected with the RLQLKL ACPP showed far red (Cy5) fluorescence, which co-localized with the GFP fluorescence (Fig. 2C). Mice injected with the uncleavable d-amino acid (rlqlkl) control showed much less Cy5 fluorescence within the tumors, which were still clearly visible by GFP fluorescence. Tumor SUVs 6 h after injection were also significantly higher for the RLQLKL ACPP 0.70 ± 0.27 (n = 6) compared with 0.34 ± 0.16 (n = 6) for rlqlkl control peptide (p = 0.022). To characterize the protease activity responsible for tumor uptake, the effect of various protease inhibitors on tissue extract mediated cleavage of RLQLKL ACPP was tested. Unfortunately, cleavage of RLQLKL ACPP by crude tissue extracts is quite resistant to inhibition by protease inhibitors, which may be due to high protease activity in tissue extracts or the multiplicity of proteases released upon tissue disruption. We therefore switched to cystic fluid obtained from fluid-filled nodules of PyMT tumors because this fluid probably contained proteases that had been secreted by adjacent tumor tissue and was less likely than tumor extracts to be contaminated with intracellular proteases. The use of similar tumor cystic fluids (although obtained from pancreatic and not mammary tumors) for cancer protease profiling has been reported elsewhere (28.Alles A.J. Warshaw A.L. Southern J.F. Compton C.C. Lewandrowski K.B. Ann. Surg. 1994; 21"

https://openalex.org/W2116916154,"Although sphingomyelin is an important cellular lipid, its subcellular distribution is not precisely known. Here we use a sea anemone cytolysin, equinatoxin II (EqtII), which specifically binds sphingomyelin, as a new marker to detect cellular sphingomyelin. A purified fusion protein composed of EqtII and green fluorescent protein (EqtII-GFP) binds to the SM rich apical membrane of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) II cells when added exogenously, but not to the SM-free basolateral membrane. When expressed intracellularly within MDCK II cells, EqtII-GFP colocalizes with markers for Golgi apparatus and not with those for nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum or plasma membrane. Colocalization with the Golgi apparatus was confirmed by also using NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Moreover, EqtII-GFP was enriched in cis-Golgi compartments isolated by gradient ultracentrifugation. The data reveal that EqtII-GFP is a sensitive probe for membrane sphingomyelin, which provides new information on cytosolic exposure, essential to understand its diverse physiological roles."

Small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of PKC gene expression showed that both novel (nPKCδ, nPKCη) and atypical (aPKCζ, aPKCι) isoforms were involved in collagenase induction by IL-1. However, MMP1 and MMP13 induction by IL-1 + OSM was inhibited only by aPKC silencing, suggesting that only atypical isoforms play a significant role in complex inflammatory milieus. Silencing of either aPKC led to diminished IL-1 + OSM-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 phosphorylation, and c-fos expression. STAT3 gene silencing or ERK pathway inhibition also resulted in loss of IL-1 + OSM-stimulated c-fos and collagenase expression.

Sci. 2007; 1108: 312-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cytokines such as interleukin (IL-)1, IL-17, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) are key mediators thought to be involved in promoting inflammatory responses in such destructive joint diseases (3.Goldring M.B.

We have shown that the IL-6 family cytokines oncostatin M (OSM) and IL-6 markedly exacerbate the catabolic potential of these mediators, synergistically promoting cartilage ECM catabolism both in vitro and in vivo (5.Hui W.

Chondrocytes are the only resident cell type in normal articular cartilage and function to preserve homeostasis. This is achieved by balancing the expression of ECM components with catabolic factors such as the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which collectively can degrade all the ECM macromolecules. During inflammatory joint diseases, chondrocytes are stimulated to secrete elevated levels of MMPs that, once activated, mediate the proteolysis of tendon, bone, and cartilage (10.Burrage P.S. Mix K.S. Brinckerhoff C.E. Front. Biosci. 2006; 11: 529-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 11.Page-McCaw A. Ewald A.J. Werb Z. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 221-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar). MMP-1 and MMP-13 are collagenolytic MMPs that have been most strongly associated with cartilage collagenolysis, a key proteolytic event in inflammatory joint diseases because it is essentially irreversible (12.Jubb R.W. Fell H.B. J. Pathol. 1980; 130: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A marked synergistic induction of collagenase gene expression occurs in human chondrocytes following IL-1 + OSM stimulation (8.Rowan A.D. Hui W. Cawston T.E. Richards C.D. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 162: 1975-1984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13.Barksby H.E. Hui W. Wappler I. Peters H.H. Milner J.M. Richards C.D. Cawston T.E. Rowan A.D.

Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and we proposed this to be via interplay of signal transduction pathways whereby signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), c-fos, and alterations in activator protein-1 (AP-1) composition are important (15.Catterall J.B. Carrère S. Koshy P.J. Degnan B.A. Shingleton W.D. Brinckerhoff C.E. Rutter J. Cawston T.E. Rowan A.D. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 2296-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). MMP gene expression is certainly reliant on transcription factors such as erythroblastosis 26 and nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) as well as AP-1 (16.Vincenti M.P. Brinckerhoff C.E. Arthritis Res. 2002; 4: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar), and we have previously demonstrated the importance of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3K) pathway in this process (17.Litherland G.J. Dixon C. Lakey R.L. Robson T. Jones D. Young D.A. Cawston T.E. Rowan A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14221-14229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, relatively little is still known about the signaling mechanisms upstream of transcriptional activation, and in particular about points of cross-talk that occur during cytokine synergy. Protein kinase C (PKC) comprises a family of serine/threonine protein kinases with key roles in fundamental cellular processes such as cell survival and apoptosis, proliferation and migration, as well as malignant transformation (18.Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The PKC family is divided into groups according to their domain structure, which determines their requirement for allosteric activators. Conventional PKC (cPKC) isoforms, designated α, βI, βII, and γ, require Ca2+ for activation, as well as diacylglycerol (DAG) and the lipid phosphatidylserine. Novel PKC (nPKC) isoforms (δ, ϵ, η, θ) lack a Ca2+ binding domain, but still require DAG and phosphatidylserine. Finally, atypical PKC (aPKC) isoforms (ζ, ι) lack the ability to bind DAG but still require a lipid cofactor. PKC isozymes are subject to “priming” phosphorylation by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1, stabilizing them and facilitating subsequent allosteric activation (18.Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), such that PKC is influenced by the PI3K pathway. The PKC pathway is a major drug target for cancer therapy (19.Chu F. Chen L.H. O'Brian C.A. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 20.Hofmann J. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 125-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) because some isoforms are important in survival/proapoptotic pathways. Altered PKC expression is observed in many tumors, and there is a large body of evidence linking PKC to invasion involving MMPs including MMP-9 (21.Liu J.F. Crépin M. Liu J.M. Barritault D. Ledoux D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1174-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 22.Urtreger A.J. Grossoni V.C. Falbo K.B. Kazanietz M.G. Bal de Kier Joffé E.D. Mol. Carcinog. 2005; 42: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). PKC activity, in particular that of nPKCθ, is of great interest with regard to T cell activation and consequently inflammatory diseases such as asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and multiple sclerosis (23.Boschelli D.H. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2009; 9: 640-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PKC inhibitors are being trialled (24.Shen G.X. Curr. Drug Targets Cardiovasc. Haematol. Disord. 2003; 3: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) as drugs for psoriasis and lymphoma (25.Budhiraja S. Singh J. Fundam. Clin.

The δ, ϵ, η, and θ isoforms of PKC are all activated in Lyme disease (29.Shin O.S. Behera A.K. Bronson R.T. Hu L.T. Cell. Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1987-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). PKC activity is necessary for neutrophil activation in gouty arthritis (30.Popa-Nita O. Proulx S. Paré G. Rollet-Labelle E. Naccache P.H. J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 2104-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and linked to OA for over a decade (31.Chu S.C. Yang S.F. Lue K.H. Hsieh Y.S. Wu C.L. Lu K.H. Connect.

Arthritis Rheum. 1999; 42: 1147-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, only recently has isoform-specific information, essential for informing future therapeutic design, begun to emerge. aPKCζ appears to regulate both NFκB and Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT pathways in inflammation (34.Moscat J. Rennert P. Diaz-Meco M.T. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 702-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). aPKCζ is reported to be required for NFκB activation in chondrocytes, is up-regulated in OA (35.LaVallie E.R. Chockalingam P.S. Collins-Racie L.A. Freeman B.A. Keohan C.C. Leitges M. Dorner A.J. Morris E.A. Majumdar M.K. Arai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24124-24137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and its inhibition reduces aggrecanase-1 expression (36.Chockalingam P.S. Varadarajan U. Sheldon R.

Arthritis Rheum. 2007; 56: 4074-4083Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). nPKCδ has been implicated in cross-talk with mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) for MMP13 expression (37.Im H.J. Muddasani P. Natarajan V. Schmid T.M. Block J.A. Davis F. van Wijnen A.J. Loeser R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11110-11121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In other systems, PKC enhances extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling via phosphorylation of the Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) (38.Caraglia M. Tassone P. Marra M. Budillon A. Venuta S. Tagliaferri P. Ann. Oncol. 2006; 17: vii124-vii127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 39.Keller E.T. Fu Z. Brennan M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). nPKCδ stimulates transcriptional activity of STAT1, another target for cancer therapy (40.Quesnelle K.M. Boehm A.L. Grandis J.R. J. Cell Biochem. 2007; 102: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) via Ser-727 phosphorylation (41.Uddin S. Sassano A. Deb D.K. Verma A. Majchrzak B. Rahman A. Malik A.B.

Therefore, PKC can influence multiple signaling pathways that are important in disease processes involving dysregulated MMP expression. However, little is still known regarding the role of specific PKC isoforms in collagenase gene expression during cartilage ECM destruction in rheumatoid arthritis or OA. In this study we assess the role of PKC activity in cartilage degradation stimulated by IL-1 + OSM, and investigate the role of individual PKC isoforms in collagenase expression in human chondrocytes. We show that aPKC isoforms play a major role in this process, via STAT3 and ERK activation, and subsequent expression of c-fos. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated and of the highest purity available. All cytokines were recombinant human. IL-1α was a generous gift from Dr. Keith Ray (GlaxoSmithKline, Stevenage, UK). OSM was prepared in-house using expression vectors kindly provided by Prof. J. Heath (University of Birmingham, UK) and methods described in Ref. 42.Staunton D. Hudson K.R. Heath J.K. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar. Gö6976, Gö6983, and calphostin C were from Merck Chemicals (Nottingham, UK). Kinase inhibitors and small interfering RNA (siRNA) reagents were screened for toxicity using the Toxilight assay of adenylate kinase release (Lonza, Wokingham, UK), and always used at concentrations that did not affect cell viability over the assay period. Expression vectors for c-fos (43.Carrozza M.L. Jacobs H. Acton D. Verma I. Berns A. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1083-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and c-jun were derived from pCMV2 and were generously provided by Dr. I. Verma (Salk Institute for Biological Studies, San Diego, CA) and Prof. Paul Dobner (University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA), respectively. Human chondrocytes were obtained by enzymatic digestion of macroscopically normal articular cartilage from OA patients undergoing joint replacement surgery as described (44.Cleaver C.S. Rowan A.D. Cawston T.E. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2001; 60: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All subjects gave informed consent and the study was approved by the Newcastle and North Tyneside Joint Ethics Committee. Bovine cartilage was dissected from nasal septi obtained from a local abattoir as described (45.Shingleton W.D. Ellis A.J. Rowan A.D. Cawston T.E. J. Cell Biochem. 2000; 79: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). T/C28a4 immortalized human chondrocytes (46.Goldring M.B. Birkhead J.R. Suen L.F. Yamin R. Mizuno S. Glowacki J. Arbiser J.L. Apperley J.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2307-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) were used in some experiments as indicated. Chondrocytes were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin, 40 units/ml of nystatin. Bovine nasal septum cartilage discs were incubated in serum-free medium for 14 days in the presence of IL-1 ± OSM (± inhibitors), changing medium after 7 days as previously described (45.Shingleton W.D. Ellis A.J. Rowan A.D. Cawston T.E. J. Cell Biochem. 2000; 79: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The cartilage remaining at day 14 was digested with papain (45.Shingleton W.D. Ellis A.J. Rowan A.D. Cawston T.E. J. Cell Biochem. 2000; 79: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Lack of toxicity for treatments including inhibitors was confirmed by the Toxilight assay. Hydroxyproline measurements (47.Bergman I. Loxley R. Anal. Chem. 1963; 35: 1961-1965Crossref Scopus (1308) Google Scholar) were used as an estimate of cartilage collagen, and the cumulative release was calculated and expressed as a percentage of the total for each well (48.Cawston T.E. Curry V.A. Summers C.A. Clark I.M. Riley G.P. Life P.F. Spaull J.R. Goldring M.B. Koshy P.J. Rowan A.D. Shingleton W.D. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 1760-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Collagenolytic activity present in the culture medium from cartilage explants was determined using a diffuse fibril assay with 3H-acetylated collagen (49.Koshy P.J. Rowan A.D. Life P.F. Cawston T.E. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 275: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One unit of collagenase activity degrades 1 μg of collagen per min at 37 °C. Gelatin zymography was performed as described previously (50.Bigg H.F. Rowan A.D. Barker M.D. Cawston T.E. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 1246-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Chondrocyte lysates were prepared as described previously (17.Litherland G.J. Dixon C. Lakey R.L. Robson T. Jones D. Young D.A. Cawston T.E. Rowan A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14221-14229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In some experiments chondrocytes were subjected to subcellular fractionation using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Protein Extraction Kit or Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit (both from ThermoFisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK). Lysates or fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and subsequently probed using the following antibodies: PKCζ, PKCι, PKCζ/ι*T410/403, ERK1/2, ERK1/2*T202/Y204, phospho(Ser)-PKC substrate, STAT1, STAT1*Y701, STAT3, STAT3*Y705, STAT3*S727, PKD*S916, lamin A/C, caveolin-1, and Histone H3 were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA); RKIP*S153, β-tubulin, PKCδ, and PKCδ*T507 were from Epitomics (Insight Biotechnology Ltd., Middlesex, UK); Fos and Jun were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); MARCKS and MARCKS*S158 were from GenScript USA Inc. (Piscataway, NJ), PKCη*T655 was from Millipore (Watford, UK). Primary human articular chondrocytes were stimulated with IL-1 ± OSM (± inhibitors preincubated with the cells for 1 h) for 24 h in serum-free conditions (9.Rowan A.D. Koshy P.J. Shingleton W.D. Degnan B.A. Heath J.K. Vernallis A.B. Spaull J.R. Life P.F. Hudson K. Cawston T.E. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 1620-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The medium was removed and assayed by specific immunoassay for MMP-1 (51.Clark I.M. Powell L.K. Wright J.K. Cawston T.E. Hazleman B.L. Matrix. 1992; 12: 475-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and MMP-13 (52.Morgan T.G. Rowan A.D. Dickinson S.C. Jones D. Hollander A.P. Deehan D. Cawston T.E. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 2006; 65: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The MMP assays detected both the pro- and active forms. Primary human chondrocytes were prepared and cultured as above, and transfected as described previously (17.Litherland G.J. Dixon C. Lakey R.L. Robson T. Jones D. Young D.A. Cawston T.E. Rowan A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14221-14229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As an initial screen for modulation of MMP expression, siRNA reagents (3 duplexes per gene, pooled) from the MISSIONTM siRNA Human Kinase Panel (Sigma) were used. Dharmacon ON-TARGET plusTM SMARTpools® (ThermoFisher Scientific) of 4 specific siRNA duplexes (total of 100 nm siRNA) were used for follow-up studies where appropriate. Supplemental Table S1 details the target or siRNA sequences used. After transfection, cells were serum-starved for 24 h then stimulated for 45 min to measure c-fos and c-jun, or 24 h for MMP mRNAs. Depletion of gene-specific mRNA levels was calculated by comparison of expression levels with cells transfected with 100 nm siCONTROL (non-targeting siRNA 2, catalog number 001210-02; Dharmacon). RNA was stabilized in cell lysates in a 96-well format, cDNA synthesized and real time PCR assays were conducted using conditions described previously (17.Litherland G.J. Dixon C. Lakey R.L.

Primer and probe sequences used are detailed in supplemental Table S2. The methods for transient transfection of T/C28a4 chondrocytes were modified from those described previously (53.Botelho F.M.

Brinckerhoff C.E. Rutter J. Cawston T.E. Rowan A.D. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 2296-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar. Transfected cells were stimulated overnight prior to determination of luciferase activity (Promega) using a 1450 Microbeta TriLux counter (Wallac, PerkinElmer, Milan, Italy). Luminescence values were normalized to the amount of plasmid per well, as determined by the Hirt assay (55.Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar). In co-transfection experiments, equal amounts of plasmid were used with the appropriate control vector. Statistical differences between sample groups were assessed using one-way analysis of variance with a post hoc Bonferroni's multiple comparison test or Student's two-tailed unpaired t test (1 sample t test for immunoblot quantification), where ***, p < 0.001; **, p < 0.01; *, p < 0.05. For clarity, only selected comparisons are presented in some figures. Because PKC has previously been reported to play a role in MMP expression in chondrocytes, we sought to assess whether this was the case for bovine cartilage stimulated using the potent synergistic cytokine combination, IL-1 + OSM. Many kinase inhibitors, including PKC inhibitors, have been shown to lack specificity (56.Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3957) Google Scholar). For this reason, we used inhibitors with relatively few reported selectivity issues, and with distinct mechanisms. Gö6976 and Gö6983 are related ATP-competitive indolylmaleimides. Calphostin C (Cal C) was also used, which acts via a DAG-competitive mechanism (57.Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). However, it cannot be excluded that Cal C may act to inhibit DAG effectors other than PKC. Fig. 1A shows that Gö6976 (10 μm), Gö6983 (20 μm), and Cal C (2 μm) all significantly inhibited IL-1 + OSM-stimulated collagen release from bovine cartilage. Furthermore, the levels of collagenase activity assayed in medium from these cultures were markedly inhibited (Fig. 1A). The much greater effect of PKC inhibition against collagenase activity compared with collagen release reflects our previous findings that residual collagenase activity exceeding 1 unit/ml is sufficient to catalyze efficient cartilage collagenolysis (58.Shingleton W.D. Jones D. Xu X. Cawston T.E. Rowan A.D. Rheumatology. 2006; 45: 958-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We next used gelatin zymography to examine the effect of PKC inhibition on gelatinase activity, which may be viewed as the subsequent step to collagenase activity in the breakdown of cartilage collagen. Fig. 1B shows that PKC inhibition results in marked reduction of IL-1 + OSM-stimulated gelatinase activity in cartilage-conditioned medium, particularly that of the inducible gelatinase, MMP-9. We next determined whether our findings could be extrapolated to human chondrocytes. First, we confirmed that the classical PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate markedly enhanced both basal and IL-1 + OSM-stimulated expression of both MMP1 and MMP13 genes in human chondrocytes (Fig. 2A). Preincubation of cells with each of the PKC inhibitors abrogated IL-1 + OSM-stimulated expression of both MMP1 and MMP13 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Collagenase gene expression in response to a stimulus of IL-1 alone was similarly sensitive to the presence of PKC inhibitors (data not shown). The less selective compounds bisindolyl maleimide I, Ro31-8220, and chelerythrine had similar effects (not shown). The DAG kinase inhibitor, R59-022, had no effect on cytokine-stimulated expression of either MMP1 or MMP13 (data not shown), excluding a role for this major class of alternative, non-PKC DAG effectors. We then assessed whether the observed abrogation of collagenase gene induction by PKC inhibition in human chondrocytes was reflected in the amount of collagenase secreted into the culture medium by the cells. Measurement of MMP-1 and MMP-13 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed that PKC inhibition caused a marked reduction in IL-1 + OSM-stimulated collagenase production and secretion from chondrocytes (Fig. 2C). To assess whether PKC was actively stimulated by IL-1 + OSM, we next examined if stimulation of chondrocytes with these proinflammatory cytokines could enhance priming phosphorylation of PKC isoforms, which allows activation by allosteric factors and prevents ubiquitin-mediated degradation (59.Steinberg S.F. Physiol.

https://openalex.org/W2003483601,"The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex plays pivotal roles in mammalian transcriptional regulation. In this study, we identify the human requiem protein (REQ/DPF2) as an adaptor molecule that links the NF-kappaB and SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling factor. Through in vitro binding experiments, REQ was found to bind to several SWI/SNF complex subunits and also to the p52 NF-kappaB subunit through its nuclear localization signal containing the N-terminal region. REQ, together with Brm, a catalytic subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, enhances the NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional activation that principally involves the RelB/p52 dimer. Both REQ and Brm were further found to be required for the induction of the endogenous BLC (CXCL13) gene in response to lymphotoxin stimulation, an inducer of the noncanonical NF-kappaB pathway. Upon lymphotoxin treatment, REQ and Brm form a larger complex with RelB/p52 and are recruited to the BLC promoter in a ligand-dependent manner. Moreover, a REQ knockdown efficiently suppresses anchorage-independent growth in several cell lines in which the noncanonical NF-kappaB pathway was constitutively activated. From these results, we conclude that REQ functions as an efficient adaptor protein between the SWI/SNF complex and RelB/p52 and plays important roles in noncanonical NF-kappaB transcriptional activation and its associated oncogenic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2024401137,"Fragile X syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental retardation, is caused by the absence of the RNA-binding protein fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP regulates local protein synthesis in dendritic spines. Dopamine (DA) is involved in the modulation of synaptic plasticity. Activation of DA receptors can regulate higher brain functions in a protein synthesis-dependent manner. Our recent study has shown that FMRP acts as a key messenger for DA modulation in forebrain neurons. Here, we demonstrate that FMRP is critical for DA D1 receptor-mediated synthesis of synapse-associated protein 90/PSD-95-associated protein 3 (SAPAP3) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). DA D1 receptor stimulation induced dynamic changes of FMRP phosphorylation. The changes in FMRP phosphorylation temporally correspond with the expression of SAPAP3 after D1 receptor stimulation. Protein phosphatase 2A, ribosomal protein S6 kinase, and mammalian target of rapamycin are the key signaling molecules for FMRP linking DA D1 receptors to SAPAP3. Knockdown of SAPAP3 did not affect surface expression of α-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) GluR1 receptors induced by D1 receptor activation but impaired their subsequent internalization in cultured PFC neurons; the subsequent internalization of GluR1 was also impaired in Fmr1 knock-out PFC neurons, suggesting that FMRP may be involved in subsequent internalization of GluR1 through regulating the abundance of SAPAP3 after DA D1 receptor stimulation. Our study thus provides further insights into FMRP involvement in DA modulation and may help to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying impaired learning and memory in fragile X syndrome.

Our recent study has identified FMRP as a key messenger for DA modulation in forebrain (40Wang H. Wu L.J. Kim S.S. Lee F.J. Gong B. Toyoda H. Ren M. Shang Y.Z. Xu H. Liu F. Zhao M.G. Zhuo M.

However, it is still unknown whether FMRP could be involved in protein synthesis induced by DA receptor stimulation. In the present study, we demonstrate that DA D1 receptor stimulation could induce expression of SAPAP3 and dynamic changes of FMRP phosphorylation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). DA D1 receptor-induced SAPAP3 expression is protein synthesis-dependent and requires FMRP. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K1) are the key signaling molecules in regulation of FMRP phosphorylation and SAPAP3 expression by DA D1 receptors. Knockdown of SAPAP3 did not affect surface expression of AMPA GluR1 receptors induced by D1 receptor stimulation but impaired their subsequent internalization in cultured PFC neurons. Similarly, the subsequent internalization of surface GluR1 was also impaired in Fmr1 knock-out (KO) PFC neurons. Our study thus provides evidence for DA receptor-mediated synapse-associated protein synthesis and reveals one possible molecular mechanism by which FMRP contributes to DA modulation in forebrain.

Briefly, ice-cold PBS (with calcium and magnesium, pH 7.4; Invitrogen) were added to the cultures or slices to prevent receptor internalization. The cultures or slices were incubated in sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (0.3 mg/ml in cold PBS; Pierce) for 30 min. The surface biotinylation were stopped by removal of the above solution and incubation in 10 mm ice-cold glycine in PBS for 20 min. Then the samples were washed three times with cold PBS and lysed by radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated with 100 μl of ImmunoPure immobilized streptavidin (Pierce). Biotinylated proteins were separated on 4–12% SDS-PAGE gel and detected by Western blot using specific antibodies for AMPA receptor subunits. The data were presented as the mean values ± S.E.

In this study, to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms for FMRP involvement in DA modulation, we investigated whether DA receptor stimulation could induce synapse-associated protein expression in adult PFC slices. By Western blot, we found that application of DA D1 receptor agonist SKF81297 (5 μm, 5 min) could increase SAPAP3 expression in a time-dependent manner in PFC slices, the increase could be observed immediately after 5 min treatment, and the highest level was reached at the 10-min time point (n = 6; Fig. 1A). Then the SAPAP3 expression started to decrease and reached the control basal levels at the 20-min time point (Fig. 1A). By contrast, application of DA D2 receptor agonist bromocriptine (5 μm, 5 min) did not affect SAPAP3 expression in PFC slices (n = 5; Fig. 1B). These data indicate that DA D1 receptor stimulation can regulate SAPAP3 expression in PFC neurons.

We next investigated whether DA receptor stimulation could affect the phosphorylation status of FMRP in PFC. By immunoprecipitation and Western blot, we found that application of DA D1 receptor agonist SKF81297 (5 μm, 5 min) could cause rapid changes of FMRP phosphorylation at serine residues in PFC slices, the dramatic decrease of FMRP phosphorylation could be observed immediately after 5 min of treatment (n = 6; Fig. 1C), and then FMRP phosphorylation levels rapidly went up to the control levels after the 10-min time point (p < 0.01, compared with the values at the 5-min time point, n = 6; Fig. 1C), closely paralleling the temporal profile of SAPAP3 expression seen in Fig. 1A.

However, we found that p94/calpain 3, a skeletal-muscle-specific member of the Ca(2+)-activated intracellular ""modulator proteases"" that is responsible for a limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (""calpainopathy""), underwent Na(+)-dependent, but not Cs(+)-dependent, autolysis in the absence of Ca(2+). Furthermore, Na(+) and Ca(2+) complementarily activated autolysis of p94 at physiological concentrations. By blocking Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, we confirmed intracellular autolysis of p94 in cultured cells. This was further confirmed using inactive p94:C129S knock-in (p94CS-KI) mice as negative controls. Mutagenesis studies showed that much of the p94 molecule contributed to its Na(+)/Ca(2+)-dependent autolysis, which is consistent with the scattered location of calpainopathy-associated mutations, and that a conserved Ca(2+)-binding sequence in the protease acted as a Na(+) sensor. Proteomic analyses using Cs(+)/Mg(2+) and p94CS-KI mice as negative controls revealed that Na(+) and Ca(2+) direct p94 to proteolyze different substrates. We propose three roles for Na(+) dependence of p94; 1) to increase sensitivity of p94 to changes in physiological [Ca(2+)], 2) to regulate substrate specificity of p94, and 3) to regulate contribution of p94 as a structural component in muscle cells. Finally, this is the first example of an intracellular Na(+)-dependent enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2160327450,"The ability to reprogram in vivo a somatic cell after differentiation is quite limited. One of the most impressive examples of such a process is transdifferentiation of pigmented epithelial cells (PECs) to lens cells during lens regeneration in newts. However, very little is known of the molecular events that allow newt cells to transdifferentiate. Histone B4 is an oocyte-type linker histone that replaces the somatic-type linker histone H1 during reprogramming mediated by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). We found that B4 is expressed and required during transdifferentiation of PECs. Knocking down of B4 decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis, which resulted in considerable smaller lens. Furthermore, B4 knockdown altered gene expression of key genes of lens differentiation and nearly abolished expression of gamma-crystallin. These data are the first to show expression of oocyte-type linker histone in somatic cells and its requirement in newt lens transdifferentiation and suggest that transdifferentiation in newts might share common strategies with reprogramming after SCNT."

According to previous studies, the gene encoding 25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) 24-hydroxylase, CYP24, which is the strongest known 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)-responsive gene, has multiple VDREs that locate within the proximal and the distal promoter. However, it has remained unclear, what is the biological role of these regions and how they participate in the regulation of transcription. In this study, we found a different CYP24 expression profile in normal (MCF-10A) and malignant (MCF-7) human mammary cells. Moreover, CYP24 mRNA showed to be three times more stable in MCF-7 cells than in MCF-10A cells. We studied the mechanism of this difference using expression profiling, quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation and chromosome conformation capture assays. Interestingly, the number of functional VDREs was higher in MCF-7 cells than in MCF-10A cells. Three functional VDREs in MCF-7 cells are connected to linear mRNA accumulation, whereas only one VDRE seems to lead to stepwise CYP24 mRNA accumulation in MCF-10A cells. The distal VDREs were involved in transcriptional regulation via ligand-dependent, dynamic chromatin looping, which brings cyclically the distal elements together either individually or simultaneously next to the transcription start site. In conclusion, our data suggest that in comparison to normal cells, clearing of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) is enhanced in malignant cells due to differences in transcriptional regulation of CYP24 and metabolism of CYP24 mRNA."

Although ABCC6 is mainly expressed in the liver the disease has dermatologic, ocular, and cardiovascular symptoms. We investigated the transcriptional regulation of the gene and observed that hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) inhibits its expression in HepG2 cells via the activation of ERK1/2. Similarly, other factors activating the cascade also inhibited ABCC6 expression. We identified the ERK1/2 response element in the proximal promoter by luciferase reporter gene assays. This site overlapped with a region conferring the tissue-specific expression pattern to the gene and with a putative hepatocyte nuclear factor 4alpha (HNF4alpha) binding site. We demonstrated that HNF4alpha regulates the expression of ABCC6, acts through the putative binding site, and determines its cell type-specific expression. We also showed that HNF4alpha is inhibited by the activation of the ERK1/2 cascade. In conclusion we describe here the first regulatory pathway of ABCC6 expression showing that the ERK1/2-HNF4alpha axis has an important role in regulation of the gene."
https://openalex.org/W2095211227,"Although commitment to epidermal differentiation is generally considered to be irreversible, differentiated keratinocytes (KCs) have been shown to maintain a regenerative potential and to reform skin epithelia when placed in a suitable environment. To obtain insights into the mechanism of reinitiation of this proliferative response in differentiated KCs, we examined the reversibility of commitment to Ca(2+)-induced differentiation. Lowering Ca(2+) concentration to micromolar levels triggered culture-wide morphological and biochemical changes, as indicated by derepression of cyclin D1, reinitiation of DNA synthesis, and acquisition of basal cell-like characteristics. These responses were inhibited by Goedecke 6976, an inhibitor of protein kinase D (PKD) and PKCalpha, but not with GF109203X, a general inhibitor of PKCs, suggesting PKD activation by a PKC-independent mechanism. PKD activation followed complex kinetics with a biphasic early transient phosphorylation within the first 6 h, followed by a sustained and progressive phosphorylation beginning at 24 h. The second phase of PKD activation was followed by prolonged ERK1/2 signaling and progression to DNA synthesis in response to the low Ca(2+) switch. Specific knockdown of PKD-1 by RNA interference or expression of a dominant negative form of PKD-1 did not have a significant effect on normal KC proliferation and differentiation but did inhibit Ca(2+)-mediated reinitiation of proliferation and reversion in differentiated cultures. The present study identifies PKD as a major regulator of a proliferative response in differentiated KCs, probably through sustained activation of the ERK-MAPK pathway, and provides new insights into the process of epidermal regeneration and wound healing."

Similarly, germ line deletion of C/EBPα leads to defective white adipose tissue formation in vivo and reduced adipogenic differentiation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) in vitro (9Wu Z.

Interestingly, ectopic expression of PPARγ in C/EBPα-deficient MEFs rescues the adipogenic potential of these cells, whereas C/EBPα is incapable of driving the adipogenic program in cells lacking PPARγ (13Rosen E.D.

These observations suggest that both PPARγ and C/EBPα function in an adipocyte differentiation pathway in which PPARγ is located downstream of C/EBPα. Despite the detailed understanding of these important regulators of adipogenesis, little is known about the regulation of molecules involved in earlier steps of adipogenesis (14Imagawa M. Tsuchiya T.

Recently, in vitro studies have shown that ID2 and ID3 may regulate genes expressed during adipocyte differentiation, including adiponectin, hormone-sensitive lipase, and fatty-acid synthase (17Moldes M.

In addition to its role in adipocyte differentiation, ID2 also is known to contribute to the circadian regulation of lipid metabolism in vivo (21Hou T.Y. Ward S.M. Murad J.M. Watson N.P. Israel M.A. Duffield G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 31735-31745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The expression of another member of this family of proteins, ID4, increases in response to hormone-induced adipocyte differentiation, although its role in adipogenesis and adipose tissue formation is unknown (22Chen H. Weng Y.C. Schatteman G.C. Sanders L. Christy R.J. Christy B.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 256: 614-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine whether ID4 contributes to adipogenesis in vitro and in vivo, and if so what effect it might have on adipose tissue formation. C57BL/6 Id4−/− mice were derived as described previously (23Yun K. Mantani A. Garel S. Rubenstein J. Israel M.A. Development. 2004; 131: 5441-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). C57BL/6 adult animals indicated as “WT” or “control” in all experiments were age-matched littermates of the Id4−/− animals examined. All animals were housed in a standard pathogen-free facility at 22 °C on 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and had continuous access to standard rodent chow (Teklad Global Rodent 2018SX; Global Diets) containing 53.3% carbohydrates, 18.5% protein, and 5.5% fat. Mice on enriched fat diet (EFD) were maintained for 6 weeks on Love Mash (Bio-serv), containing 50.9% carbohydrates, 13.2% protein, and 14.3% fat. Mice on high fat diet (HFD) were maintained for 6 weeks on HFD (Bio-serv), containing 36.3% carbohydrates, 20% protein, and 35.5% fat. All animals had access to water ad libitum. Body weight changes were normalized by dividing the change in interval weight by the initial body weight, because animals of each genotype varied in weight at the beginning of individual experiments. Food consumption was measured using M2100 metabolic cages (Lab Products Inc.). All procedures were approved and performed in accordance with Dartmouth College Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were isolated from 13.5-day-old embryos by trypsin digestion and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Experiments were conducted with MEFs between passages 1 and 3. 3T3-L1 mouse pre-adipocyte cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and maintained as suggested by the provider. Adipocyte differentiation was induced by treating confluent 3T3-L1 cells (day 0) for 2 days with DMI, 1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma), 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma), and 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma) or confluent MEFs with DMI-R, 1 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 10 μg/ml insulin, plus 10 μm rosiglitazone (Alexis Biochemicals). Following treatment of either cell type with the designated drug mixture for 2 days, they received an additional 2 days of treatment with 10 μg/ml insulin, and then they were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum until day 10. After 10 days of differentiation, cells were used for either RNA isolation using RNeasy (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, protein isolation, or histological evaluation by staining for lipid accumulation with Oil Red O staining (Sigma). For retrovirus production, Phoenix cells (Orbigen) were transfected with the plasmids encoding the genes of interest using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Following 48 h of culture, media containing retroviruses were harvested and used to transduce target cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml of Polybrene (Sigma). Stable cell lines were selected in the presence of 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). We used shRNA against ID4 or scramble shRNA to engineer cells lines in which Id4 expression was inhibited. shRNA targeting Id4 had the following sequence: ID4.HIND, 5′-GATCCCCGTCAGCAAAGTGGAGATCCTTCAAGAGAGGATCTCCACTTTGCTGACTTTTTA-3′; ID4.HIND-As, 5′-AGCTTAAAAAGTCAGCAAAGTGGAGATCCTCTCTTGAAGGATCTCCACTTTGCTGACGGG-3′. Scramble shRNA and shRNA targeting Id4 were cloned in the expression vector pSUPER.Retro (OligoEngine). MRI was used to quantify percent body fat of mice. Mice were anesthetized by inhalation of 1–2% isoflurane in 50:50 (v/v) mixture of oxygen and air delivered through a face mask before and during the MRI scans. A rectal fiber optic probe was used to monitor the core body temperature. The animal core body temperature was maintained at 35–37 °C by using a thermostated water circulating heating element. All the MRI experiments were performed on a 7 tesla, 20-cm diameter horizontal bore magnet (Magnex Scientific Ltd.) equipped with actively shielded imaging gradients. The maximum gradient strength was 77 G/cm, and the magnet was interfaced to a Varian Inova Unity console (Varian, Inc.). A 38-mm diameter Varian birdcage coil was used for data acquisition. Proton density weighted multislice spin-echo images were acquired with the following parameters: repetition time (TR) 1.5 s, echo time (TE) 15 ms, matrix size of 128 × 128, and four signal averaging. Twenty four to 30 2-mm-thick transaxial slices were acquired from each animal examined (field of view 30 mm2) with either frequency-specific saturation on fat (1.3 ppm) or water (4.7 ppm) peaks. The total acquisition time was 12 min 48 s for each set of the water and (water suppressed) fat images. The frequency-selective suppression pulses were optimized to achieve the complete suppression using the Chemical Shift Selective (CHESS) procedure (24Haase A. Frahm J. Hänicke W. Matthaei D. Phys. Med. Biol. 1985; 30: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). The MRI images were transferred to ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) software (www.rsbweb.nih.gov) for analysis. Images were converted to binary and the program quantified the number of pixels corresponding to fat. Total area of fat for each image was summed and multiplied by fat density and section thickness to give total fat mass per mouse. Percent body fat was calculated by dividing fat mass by total body mass. Fat tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight and embedded in paraffin. All specimens were cut in 5-μm sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Sigma) according to standard protocols. Photomicrographs were obtained with a digital camera (Olympus BX60), and sections were analyzed using ImagePro5.1 software. Fat tissue histological sections were analyzed under ×20 magnification, and cell area was measured using ImageJ. Mean surface area was calculated based on the measurement of 200 adipocytes in three different histological sections from each of three different animals of each genotype. We used the area of the adipocyte as it appears histologically as a surrogate for adipocyte size, and we determined the area in μm2 by converting the number of pixels corresponding to an adipocyte into an area measured by a micrometer (25Chen H.C. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 986-989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples from white adipose tissue were harvested and immediately placed in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) for RNA isolation. Reverse transcription was performed using iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA served as the template for quantitative real time PCR using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The primer sequences of the genes analyzed are available upon request. qRT-PCR was performed using iCycler Thermocycler (Bio-Rad) and relative quantification was calculated using the 2−(ΔΔCt) method. 3T3-L1 cells were isolated in lysis buffer (150 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Western blot analysis was performed according to standard protocols using antibodies against ID4, C/EBPα, PPARγ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and β-actin (Sigma), which served as loading control. Serum adiponectin and leptin measurements were done in mice fed standard rodent chow diet ad libitum using an adiponectin ELISA kit (Linco) or a leptin ELISA kit (Crystal Chem). Triglycerides were assayed in mice fed a standard rodent chow diet or HFD ad libitum using a commercial kit (Biovision). Cholesterol and free fatty acid levels were assayed in animals fed an HFD using a commercial kit (Biovision). Blood pressure and heart rate of WT and Id4−/− mice were measure by the tail-cuff method using Coda 6 (Kent Scientific). All of the blood pressure and heart rate measurements were taken from 12- to 14-week-old mice, and the values from 150 successful readings (30 readings on each of 5 days) per mouse were used to calculate individual averages ± S.E. Mean ± S.E. values were plotted using Prism (version 5; GraphPad software). Statistical comparisons between groups were performed using the Student's t test. Data were considered significantly different if p values were ≤0.05. To evaluate the role of Id4 in adipocyte differentiation, we employed an established in vitro system for evaluating adipocyte differentiation, 3T3-L1 (26Green H. Meuth M. Cell. 1974; 3: 127-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). As described under “Experimental Procedures,” 2 days after 3T3-L1 cells reached confluence, we replaced normal growth media with a widely used adipogenic mixture, DMI, to induce adipocyte differentiation (26Green H. Meuth M. Cell. 1974; 3: 127-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). As expected, we observed that after 4–5 days of differentiation, these cells began to produce fat (data not shown). Therefore, we monitored the expression of ID4 during the course of 3T3-L1 differentiation (Fig. 1A). We found that Id4 expression was rapidly induced within 3 h of drug treatment and remained relatively high up to 48 h after the induction of differentiation. To address the importance of Id4 in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation, we used a recombinant retroviral vector to prepare 3T3-L1 cells stably expressing shRNA against Id4 and 3T3-L1 cells expressing scrambled shRNA for comparison as control. Cells expressing shRNA against Id4 had decreased levels of Id4 (Fig. 1B). Although there were no striking morphological changes in these altered 3T3-L1 cells prior to the initiation of differentiation (data not shown), 10 days following the induction of differentiation, there was a significant decrease in intracellular fat production as measured by Oil Red O staining of 3T3-L1 expressing shRNA against Id4 when compared with cells expressing the control plasmid (Fig. 1C). In addition, decreased expression of ID4 led to a significant decrease in the expression levels of C/EBPα and PPARγ (Fig. 2A), which are known to act as important regulators of genes involved in adipocyte differentiation. We also examined the mRNA levels of C/EBPα, PPARγ2, and adipocyte differentiation markers, aP2 (fatty acid-binding protein 4), Glut-4, and lipoprotein lipase after 10 days of differentiation, and we observed that they were significantly reduced in adipocytes with reduced levels of ID4 (Fig. 2B). Our finding that decreased Id4 expression in 3T3L1 cells results in reduced adipocyte differentiation and reduced expression of fat differentiation markers suggests an important role for ID4 in adipocyte differentiation.FIGURE 2Id4 modulates the expression of adipogenic markers.

We observed that Id4−/− mice had a reduction in both white adipose tissue (WAT), as exemplified by a greatly diminished visceral fat pad (Fig. 3A, upper panels), and brown adipose tissue (BAT), as demonstrated by greatly reduced fat in the interscapular area (Fig. 3A, lower panels). To quantify the amount of adipose tissue in Id4−/− mice, we compared the body fat mass in each of these genotypes using MRI. MRI allowed us to compare a more global measure of body fat in each individual mouse than can be otherwise estimated by standard anthropometric methods (27Abate N. Burns D. Peshock R.M. Garg A. Grundy S.M. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1490-1496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of MRI axial sections of adipose tissue, which is recognizable in our MRI as bright white areas, confirmed the predicted decrease in body fat (Fig. 3B). We found that the average percentage of body fat weight in Id4−/− mice was ∼50% less than that observed in WT animals (Fig. 3C). To examine the residual adipose tissue at these sites in Id4−/− mice, we prepared hematoxylin and eosin-stained histological sections of WAT and BAT from WT and Id4−/− mice (Fig. 3D). We observed that the size of adipocytes in WAT from Id4−/− was smaller than that in tissue from WT animals. To quantify this apparent difference, we calculated the mean surface area of adipocytes from WAT of WT and Id4−/− mice as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We found that the size of Id4−/− adipocytes in fixed histological sections was approximately half the size observed in cells from WT animals (Fig. 3E). We therefore measured the weight of Id4−/− mice and observed a trend toward their having a decreased body weight compared with WT animals (Fig. 3F). Throughout these studies, we have combined the evaluation of female and male animals as we never identified a systematic physiological difference between animals of different sexes. The observation that Id4−/− mice have reduced adipose tissue and decreased adipocyte size indicated an important role for ID4 in adipose tissue development. We therefore sought to determine whether the expression of tissue differentiation markers and adipokines typically expressed in adipose tissue is also altered in Id4−/− mice. Several of these we evaluated at the mRNA level, because adipocyte differentiation is controlled by transcriptional events (6Farmer S.R. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). We observed that WAT from Id4−/− mice had reduced expression of transcriptional regulators C/EBPα and PPARγ2 and adipocyte differentiation markers aP2, Glut-4, and lipoprotein lipase compared with levels in WAT from WT mice (Fig. 4A). In addition, the expression of adiponectin and leptin mRNA in WAT from Id4−/− mice was significantly reduced compared with levels detected in this tissue from WT animals (Fig. 4B). Consistent with this finding, we observed that the levels of adiponectin (Fig. 4C) and leptin (Fig. 4D) protein were also decreased in serum samples from Id4−/− mice. To examine if the reduction in adipose tissue was associated with a decrease in food consumption, we monitored WT and Id4−/− animals in metabolic cages (Fig. 4E). We did not observe any difference in the amount of food consumed between the different genotypes. To further evaluate the role of ID4 in adipocyte differentiation, we examined MEFs isolated from WT and Id4−/− embryos (day 13.5) and used these cells as a model for adipocyte differentiation (28Kubota N. Terauchi Y. Miki H. Tamemoto H. Yamauchi T. Komeda K. Satoh S. Nakano R. Ishii C. Sugiyama T. Eto K. Tsubamoto Y. Okuno A. Murakami K. Sekihara H. Hasegawa G. Naito M. Toyoshima Y. Tanaka S.

Although we observed no morphological differences in these MEF cultures prior to the initiation of differentiation (Fig. 5A, panels 1 and 2), after 10 days of differentiation a significantly higher number of differentiated adipocytes, as identified by Oil Red O staining, were observed in the MEF cultures from WT animals compared with MEFs prepared from Id4−/− animals (Fig. 5A, panels 3 and 4). We monitored the levels of Id4 expression during the course of differentiation and found that Id4 mRNA expression was induced within 12 h of drug treatment and remained elevated for up to 120 h (Fig. 5B). We also monitored the expression levels of C/EBPα and PPARγ2 in WT and Id4−/− MEFs during adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 5, C and D). We found that in MEFs from Id4−/− mice, the expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ2 was significantly reduced during differentiation when compared with the WT cells. In addition, we examined the expression of adipogenic markers in WT and Id4−/− MEFs after 10 days of differentiation (Fig. 5E). We found that the expression of adipocyte differentiation markers was greatly reduced in the Id4−/− MEFs when compared with the WT cells, a finding consistent with the reduced expression of these markers that was observed in adipose tissue from Id4−/− animals (Fig. 4A). Our results suggest that the loss of Id4 leads to a decrease in fat tissue maturation. The apparent inability of Id4−/− mice to efficiently store dietary fat in adipose tissue raised the question as whether these animals would become obese when fed a high fat diet. To examine this possibility, we placed WT and Id4−/− mice on an EFD containing about the same amount of carbohydrates and proteins found in the routine animal chow diet but with higher amounts of fat. After 6 weeks on this diet, we examined the effects of increased levels of dietary fat on adipose tissue in these mice. Although there was no significant difference in the weight of adult WT or Id4−/− mice on the routine chow diet (Fig. 3F), examination of Id4−/− mice fed an EFD revealed them to be leaner than WT animals fed the EFD (data not shown). To analyze if the decreased weight gain in these animals was associated with a decrease in fat storage, we examined and quantified the amount of fat tissue present in Id4−/− and WT animals fed the EFD for 6 weeks. Gross pathological examination showed that Id4−/− mice maintained on an EFD have less WAT and BAT than WT mice (Fig. 6A). To confirm this apparent reduction, we quantified the percentage of body fat by MRI (Fig. 6B). We found that the average percentage of body fat weight in Id4−/− mice after 6 weeks on EFD was ∼63% less than that observed in WT animals (Fig. 6C). MRI examination also documented that the difference in the percentage of body fat of animals fed these two diets was higher in WT than Id4−/− animals (Fig. 6E). The body weights of WT and Id4−/− mice fed the EFD for 6 weeks was normalized to their initial weight and evaluated during the course of this experiment. We found that Id4−/− animals gained significantly less weight than did their WT counterparts when fed the EFD (Fig. 6D). Because Id4−/− animals showed a decrease in fat storage when maintained on a diet enriched for fat, we decided to challenge these mice with a diet that had even higher levels of fat content compared with the EFD, a high fat diet. We placed WT and Id4−/− mice on the HFD containing less carbohydrates"
https://openalex.org/W2001999615,"Translation re-initiation provides the molecular basis for translational control of mammalian <i>ATF4</i> and yeast <i>GCN4</i> mediated by short upstream open reading (uORFs) in response to eIF2 phosphorylation. eIF4G is the major adaptor subunit of eIF4F that binds the cap-binding subunit eIF4E and the mRNA helicase eIF4A and is also required for re-initiation in mammals. Here we show that the yeast eIF4G2 mutations altering eIF4E- and eIF4A-binding sites increase re-initiation at <i>GCN4</i> and impair recognition of the start codons of uORF1 or uORF4 located after uORF1. The increase in re-initiation at <i>GCN4</i> was partially suppressed by increasing the distance between uORF1 and <i>GCN4</i>, suggesting that the mutations decrease the migration rate of the scanning ribosome in the <i>GCN4</i> leader. Interestingly, eIF4E overexpression suppressed both the phenotypes caused by the mutation altering eIF4E-binding site. Thus, eIF4F is required for accurate AUG selection and re-initiation also in yeast, and the eIF4G interaction with the mRNA-cap appears to promote eIF4F re-acquisition by the re-initiating 40 S subunit. However, eIF4A overexpression suppressed the impaired AUG recognition but not the increase in re-initiation caused by the mutations altering eIF4A-binding site. These results not only provide evidence that mRNA unwinding by eIF4A stimulates start codon recognition, but also suggest that the eIF4A-binding site on eIF4G made of the HEAT domain stimulates the ribosomal scanning independent of eIF4A. Based on the RNA-binding activities identified within the unstructured segments flanking the eIF4G2 HEAT domain, we discuss the role of the HEAT domain in scanning beyond loading eIF4A onto the pre-initiation complex."

Several features of pathogenesis and immunomodulation of host responses are attributable to the structural diversity in cell wall lipids, particularly in the mycolic acids. Structural modification of the α-mycolic acid by introduction of cyclopropane rings as catalyzed by the methyltransferase, PcaA, is essential for a lethal, persistent infection and the cording phenotype in M. tuberculosis. Here, we demonstrate the presence of cyclopropanated cell wall mycolates in the nonpathogenic strain Mycobacterium smegmatis and identify MSMEG_1351 as a gene encoding a PcaA homologue. Interestingly, α-mycolic acid cyclopropanation was inducible in cultures grown at 25 °C. The growth temperature modulation of the cyclopropanating activity was determined by high resolution magic angle spinning NMR analyses on whole cells. In parallel, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that MSMEG_1351 gene expression is up-regulated at 25 °C compared with 37 °C. An MSMEG_1351 knock-out strain of M. smegmatis, generated by recombineering, exhibited a deficiency in cyclopropanation of α-mycolates. The functional equivalence of PcaA and MSMEG_1351 was established by cross-complementation in the MSMEG_1351 knock-out mutant and also in a ΔpcaA strain of Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Overexpression of MSMEG_1351 restored the wild-type mycolic acid profile and the cording phenotype in BCG. Although the biological significance of mycolic acid cyclopropanation in nonpathogenic mycobacteria remains unclear, it likely represents a mechanism of adaptation of cell wall structure and composition to cope with environmental factors.

These α-branched β-hydroxylated long chain fatty acids are covalently linked to the arabinogalactan layer that is attached to the peptidoglycan backbone and are also present as extractable lipids conjugated with sugars such as trehalose, forming trehalose dimycolate (4Daffé M.

Mycolic acids from mycobacteria possess a long main carbon chain called meromycolate, which in its nascent form is interrupted by double bonds at two specific sites called the proximal (closer to the β-hydroxy) and the distal positions. Chemical modifications of these double bonds give rise to different types of mycolic acids, depending on the nature of the chemical groups introduced. Mycobacterium tuberculosis carries the following three types of mycolic acids: α-subtypes, containing two cis-cyclopropane rings, and two oxygenated subtypes, harboring methoxy and keto functions on the distal position, with a cis- or trans-cyclopropane ring on the proximal site (1Brennan P.J.

These enzymes share extensive sequence similarity, but genetic studies have revealed the distinct functional characteristics of each in the biosynthesis of mycolic acids. For example, in M. tuberculosis, PcaA is required for cis-cyclopropanation at the proximal site of α-mycolates (5Glickman M.S. Cox J.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), whereas MmaA2 converts double bonds to cis-cyclopropane rings at the distal and proximal positions of α- and oxygenated mycolates, respectively (6Glickman M.S.

MmaA4 (Hma) is required for the production of both keto and methoxy mycolates (8Dubnau E. Chan J. Raynaud C. Mohan V.P. Lanéelle M.A. Yu K. Quémard A. Smith I. Daffé M. Mol.

The fast growing nonpathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis species is characterized by a mycolic acid profile consisting mainly of cis/cis and cis/trans diethylenic α-mycolates, the mono-ethylenic shorter α′ subtype, as well as the epoxy mycolates (supplemental Fig. S1) (3Kremer L.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 6630-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Therefore, because of the apparent lack of cyclopropane rings, M. smegmatis was used in early experiments as a surrogate strain to identify and investigate the role of M. tuberculosis mycolic acid methyltransferases. For instance, the overexpression of M. tuberculosis cmaA1 leads to the conversion of the distal cis double bond into a cis-cyclopropane ring in the α-mycolate of M. smegmatis (15Yuan Y. Lee R.E. Besra G.S. Belisle J.T. Barry 3rd, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 6630-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A similar strategy was used to characterize other M. tuberculosis methyltransferases, including CmaA2 (16George K.M. Yuan Y. Sherman D.R. Barry 3rd, C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27292-27298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and MmaA2 (17Yuan Y. Barry 3rd, C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 12828-12833Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the heterologous overexpression studies yielded different results from those obtained in null mutants of the methyltransferase genes in M. tuberculosis, thus leading to conflicting interpretations of the substrate specificities of these enzymes. Mining the M. smegmatis genome revealed the presence of at least seven predicted methyltransferases, from which only one, MSMEG_0913, has recently been characterized and shown to specifically add a methyl branch to the proximal site of α- and epoxy-mycolates (18Laval F. Haites R. Movahedzadeh F. Lemassu A. Wong C.Y. Stoker N. Billman-Jacobe H. Daffé M. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1419-1427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The presence of several related genes encoding potential AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases in this species suggests that M. smegmatis has the ability to cyclopropanate its mycolic acids, although this chemical modification may not be apparent under the standard conditions used to grow M. smegmatis in the laboratory. In contrast to M. tuberculosis, which replicates at 37 °C in the human host, M. smegmatis is a saprophytic species that dwells in the soil, where it is likely exposed to rapidly changing environmental conditions (19Iivanainen E. Martikainen P.J. Väänänen P. Katila M.L. J. Appl. Microbiol. 1999; 86: 673-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20Rao M. Streur T.L. Aldwell F.E. Cook G.M. Microbiology. 2001; 147: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, we postulated that M. smegmatis utilizes this panel of methyltransferases differentially in response to environmental changes. It is well established that bacteria are able to chemically modify their phospholipids in response to environmental changes, usually by altering the acyl chains of their membrane phospholipids (21Cronan Jr., J.E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2002; 5: 202-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The three main acyl chain modifications observed involve double bonds as follows: desaturation to generate an unsaturated acyl chain, cis/trans isomerization, and cyclopropanation where a methylene carbon is added across the double bond to form a three-membered ring. However, there are few data available regarding the capacity of M. smegmatis to cyclopropanate mycolic acids. In general, cyclopropanated mycolic acids are considered to be a minor component of the cell wall in this species. Some Corynebacterineae, including M. smegmatis (22Baba T. Kaneda K. Kusunose E. Kusunose M. Yano I. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), have also been reported to alter their mycolic acid profile in response to changes in culture conditions like growth temperature (23Tomiyasu I. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 828-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Toriyama S. Yano I. Masui M. Kusunose M. Kusunose E.

J Biochem. 1980; 88: 211-221PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kremer L. Guérardel Y. Gurcha S.S. Locht C. Besra G.S. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3145-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Stratton H.M. Brooks P.R. Carr E.L. Seviour R.J. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 2003; 26: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, in M. smegmatis, the relative amounts and chain length of the different subclasses of mycolic acids are modified according to the growth temperatures (22Baba T. Kaneda K. Kusunose E. Kusunose M. Yano I. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Likewise, in Mycobacterium thermoresistibile, mycolic acid cyclopropanation has been shown to be modulated by this environmental factor (26Kremer L. Guérardel Y. Gurcha S.S. Locht C. Besra G.S. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 3145-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Here, we show that mycolic acid cyclopropanation in M. smegmatis is stimulated at lower growth temperatures. In addition, we identify a previously uncharacterized gene, MSMEG_1351, encoding a putative methyltransferase, the expression of which is regulated by temperature. We demonstrate that MSMEG_1351 catalyzes cis-cyclopropanation at the proximal site of α-mycolic acids and that this activity is significantly enhanced at temperatures lower than 37 °C. Moreover, functional complementation of a Mycobacterium bovis BCG ΔpcaA mutant with MSMEG_1351 restores both the cis-cyclopropanation of α-mycolates and the cording phenotype characterizing M. bovis BCG or M. tuberculosis, strongly indicating that MSMEG_1351 is a functional orthologue of PcaA. Bacterial strains used in this study are summarized in supplemental Table S1. M. smegmatis and M. bovis BCG Pasteur 1173 P2 strains were routinely maintained at 37 °C in Sauton's medium containing 0.025% tyloxapol (Sigma) and supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin and/or 50 μg/ml hygromycin when required. Transformed mycobacterial strains were selected on Middlebrook 7H10 agar plates with oleic acid/albumin/dextrose/catalase enrichment and the appropriate antibiotics (25 μg/ml kanamycin and/or 50 μg/ml hygromycin). When investigating growth temperature effects on mycobacteria, cultures were diluted below A600 ∼0.1 and incubated at the indicated temperatures until A600 reached 0.6–0.8 before harvesting the cells. For each transformation experiment, three independent clones were selected and maintained in Sauton's medium in the presence of kanamycin and hygromycin. Mycolic acid profile was verified for all three clones, and if the results were comparable, only one was retained for further analyses. Escherichia coli TOP10 strain was grown in Luria Broth agar supplemented with 25 μg/ml kanamycin when required. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and Vent DNA polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs. Genomic DNA of M. smegmatis wild-type and mutagenized strains was extracted as described earlier (28Larsen M.H. Biermann K. Tandberg S. Hsu T. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Curr. Protoc. Microbiol. 2007; 10A.2: 1-21Google Scholar). Briefly, glycine 1% (w/v) was added to 10 ml of late-log cultures that were then incubated around 6 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 500 μl of 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm glucose, 1 mg/ml lysozyme and incubated overnight at 37 °C. Then 150 μl of a 2:1 (v/v) solution of 10% (w/v) SDS and 10 mg/ml proteinase K was added. This mixture was incubated at 55 °C for 20–40 min. Then 200 μl of 5 m NaCl and 160 μl of 4.1% NaCl and 10% hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (Sigma) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 65 °C. Lysates were then extracted twice with 24:1 (v/v) chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, and DNA was concentrated by isopropyl alcohol precipitation. Southern blot experiments were performed with the DIG High Prime DNA labeling and detection starter kit II (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, as described previously (29Kremer L. Gurcha S.S. Bifani P. Hitchen P.G. Baulard A. Morris H.R. Dell A. Brennan P.J. Besra G.S. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 437-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All genetic manipulations in M. smegmatis were carried out using a recently developed recombineering technique in mycobacteria (30van Kessel J.C. Hatfull G.F. Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Briefly, an allelic exchange substrate for MSMEG_1351 deletion was prepared by amplifying the left and right flanking arms and cloning them on either side of the hygromycin-resistant gene in the shuttle vector pYUB854. The left arm of each gene was cloned between AflII and XbaI and the right arm between NheI and BglII. The allelic exchange substrate was then released from the vector backbone by digesting with AflII and BglII and electroporated into mc2155 expressing recombineering functions from pJV53 (30van Kessel J.C. Hatfull G.F. Nat. Methods. 2007; 4: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Colonies resistant to kanamycin and hygromycin were screened for correct gene replacement by PCR, and selected clones were validated by Southern blot analysis. The same strategy was followed to disrupt genes MSMEG_0902 and MSMEG_1203. Primers used to amplify the left and right arms of each gene are listed in supplemental Table S2. For complementation of M. smegmatis ΔMSMEG_1351, the MSMEG_1351 gene was cloned into vector pMV306 allowing stable integration of the cloned sequences in the mycobacterial genome. MSMEG_1351, including an additional 250-bp promoter-containing sequence, was amplified by PCR, using Msm mc2155 chromosomal DNA as a template and the primers 5′-GCA TGG TGC TTC TAG ACG GGA TGG GTC-3′ and 5′-CGC ATA GCG AAT TCG AAG AGC CGC TAC TTC G-3′ containing XbaI and EcoRI sites, respectively (underlined). The amplified product was cloned in the XbaI and EcoRI restriction sites in the vector pMV306, thus generating pMV306_1351. In this plasmid, the MSMEG_1351 gene is placed under the control of its own promoter-containing region. Prior to the complementation experiments, the ΔMSEG1351 mutant was cured of the recombineering plasmid pJV53 by successive subculturing of the strain in liquid medium in the absence of kanamycin, followed by plating on 7H10 agar. One of the hygromycin-resistant and kanamycin-sensitive clones was isolated and used as a host for the introduction of plasmids pMV306 or pMV306_1351. For complementation experiments, the mc22801 (BCG Pasteur pcaA::Tn5370) strain was transformed either with pMV261_pcaA (12Alahari A. Trivelli X. Guérardel Y. Dover L.G. Besra G.S. Sacchettini J.C. Reynolds R.C. Coxon G.D. Kremer L. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or pMV261_1351, which was constructed as follows. The gene was amplified by PCR using M. smegmatis mc2155 chromosomal DNA as a template and the primers 5′-TGA CCA AGC AGC CCG GAA AGC TA-3′ and 5′-CGC ATA GCG AAT TCG AAG AGC CGC TAC TTC G-3′ (containing an EcoRI site, underlined). The amplified product was cloned as a blunt/EcoRI fragment into the vector previously digested by MscI and EcoRI. In both pMV261_pcaA and pMV261_1351, the transgenes were placed under the control of the constitutive hsp60 promoter. Lipids were metabolically radiolabeled with 1 μCi/ml [2-14C]acetate (56 mCi/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) and added to mid-logarithmic phase cultures for 5–7 h. Mycolic acids were extracted as described previously (12Alahari A. Trivelli X. Guérardel Y. Dover L.G. Besra G.S. Sacchettini J.C. Reynolds R.C. Coxon G.D. Kremer L. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and analyzed by TLC on silica-coated plates. Mycolates were resolved either by normal phase TLC in hexane/ethyl acetate (19:1, v/v), run three times, or on plates impregnated with 10% silver nitrate in petroleum ether/diethyl ether (17:3, v/v), run five times (only three times in case of mycolates from M. bovis BCG strains). Two-dimensional TLC on silver nitrate-impregnated plates was carried out with hexane/ethyl acetate (19:1, v/v), run three times in the first dimension, followed by petroleum ether/diethyl ether (17:3, v/v), run five times in the second dimension (twice and three times for mycolates from M. bovis BCG strains). TLC plates were typically exposed overnight to Kodak Biomax MR films to reveal 14C-labeled lipids. The spot corresponding to lipid Z (missing in the ΔMSMEG_1351 mutant) was purified by extraction and separation of total fatty acids and mycolic acids from a 100-ml culture of the complemented strain on 20-cm-wide preparative TLC plates. α-Mycolic acids were recovered by scraping off the plates, extracted from the silica with diethyl ether and resolved on 20-cm-wide silver nitrate impregnated TLC plates. The desired spot was then similarly recovered and extracted from the silica. Radiolabeled mycolic acid methyl esters (MAMEs) from the ΔMSMEG_1351 mutant and the complemented strain were loaded on the edges of the TLC plate as internal controls to unambiguously localize the lipid of interest. The purified lipid was then subjected to a thorough structural analysis using combination NMR and MS. For liquid NMR, purified MAME samples were dissolved in deuterated chloroform containing 0.03% of tetramethyl silane for proton referencing and transferred into standard 5-mm tubes. Unidimensional proton experiments were recorded at 300 K on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm broad band inverse probe. For HR-MAS NMR analysis, cell pellets were washed several times with deuterium oxide to remove labile protons. HR-MAS 4-mm ZrO2 rotors (Cortecnet, France) were filled with 50 μl of cell suspension in D2O with 0.025% acetone (v/v) for proton referencing, centrifuged at low speed, and closed. Unidimensional proton spectrum was recorded at 293 K on a Bruker AvanceII 800 spectrometer (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped with a 1H/13C/15N 4-mm HR-MAS probe, spinning at 8 kHz, to assess the quality of the preparation. Then 10 μl of liquid were removed, replaced by 10 μl of deuterated chloroform, and stirred before recording proton experiments. The different mutant spectra were compared after normalization of the methyl signal at 0.94 ppm. Mass spectrometric analyses of intact MAMEs were performed on a Voyager Elite reflectron MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA), equipped with a 337-nm UV laser. Samples were solubilized in 1 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and mixed on target with 1 μl of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid matrix solution (10 mg/ml dissolved in chloroform/methanol 2:1, v/v). Electronic impact mass spectrometry (EI-MS) of MAMEs was performed on a TSQ Quantum GC (Thermo Fisher Scientific Electron) using direct insertion probe with a desorption temperature ranging from 50 to 450 °C. Total mRNAs were extracted following the method described earlier (28Larsen M.H. Biermann K. Tandberg S. Hsu T. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Curr. Protoc. Microbiol. 2007; 10A.2: 1-21Google Scholar), except that a bead beater apparatus was used to disrupt the bacterial cells. Briefly, cells from 5 ml of mid-logarithmic cultures were harvested, resuspended in 1 ml of RNA protect reagent (Qiagen), and incubated for 1 h on ice. The cells were collected, resuspended in 1 ml of RLT buffer from the RNeasy kit (Qiagen), transferred in a Lysing matrix B tube (MP Bio), processed in a bead beater apparatus 45 s at maximal speed three times, and held on ice before centrifugation. Supernatants (750 μl) were mixed with 525 μl of ethanol, and RNA was purified with the RNeasy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Contaminating DNA was removed following DNase I treatment (Invitrogen). RNA integrity was analyzed on a BioAnalyzer 2100 machine from Agilent, using RNA nano series II chips. Double-stranded cDNA was produced using the Superscript II or III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR were performed using an in-house SYBR Green mixture in a light cycler instrument (Roche Applied Science), as described previously (31Lutfalla G. Uze G. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 410: 386-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The PCR program consisted of initial denaturation at 98 °C for 3 min, 45 cycles of 98 °C for 5 s, 68 °C for 10 s, and 72 °C for 10 s. The mysA gene (MSMEG_2758), encoding a σ-factor was used as an internal standard and was amplified using the primers 5′-GAA GAC ACC GAC CTG GAA CT-3′ and 5′-GAC TCT TCC TCG TCC CAC AC-3′. The MSMEG_1351 gene was amplified using the primers 5′-AGG TTC ATC GTC ACC GAG AT-3′ and 5′-TAG ACC TCC TGC GAC TGG AT-3′. Primer efficiencies, measured as described previously (31Lutfalla G. Uze G. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 410: 386-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), were between 1.8 and 1.9. Cord reading agar was prepared as described previously (32Lorian V. Appl. Microbiol. 1966; 14: 603-607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Lorian V. Appl. Microbiol. 1969; 17: 559-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that Triton WR1339 was replaced by Triton X-100. Briefly, Triton X-100 was added to 7H10 medium enriched with oleic acid/albumin/dextrose/catalase and required antibiotics. Approximately 100 colony-forming units were plated, incubated at 37 °C, and visualized under a microscope MVX10 (Olympus) at ×100 magnification. The cyclopropanation of mycolic acids in M. smegmatis mc2155 and its likely regulation by growth temperature were examined. The recently developed quantitative method of HR-MAS NMR (12Alahari A. Trivelli X. Guérardel Y. Dover L.G. Besra G.S. Sacchettini J.C. Reynolds R.C. Coxon G.D. Kremer L. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was used for the determination of the relative levels of mycolate cyclopropanation in intact cells of M. smegmatis. This method is based on the relative quantification of Ha protons of cyclopropane groups at δ −0.34 on 1H HR-MAS NMR spectra. We applied this method to directly observe and assess the content of cis-cyclopropane rings in M. smegmatis grown at different temperatures. As shown in Fig. 1A, cis-cyclopropane signals detected by 1H HR-MAS NMR increased gradually as an inverse function of the temperature, suggesting that lipid cyclopropanation is regulated by growth temperature in M. smegmatis. Indeed, differential integration of cyclopropane 1H NMR signals demonstrated that the total cyclopropane content increased by 150% in cells grown at 25 °C, compared with those grown at 42 °C. Cyclopropanation of mycolates was assessed in M. smegmatis grown at different temperatures and subsequently metabolically labeled with [14C]acetate. Mycolic acids were extracted and analyzed by TLC using different solvent systems. A striking difference in the ratio of the α-, α′-, and epoxy-mycolate subclasses was observed at different temperatures (Fig. 1B, left panel). In particular, at 25 °C, the synthesis of α′-mycolates was almost completely abrogated, whereas a marked increase in the synthesis of epoxy-mycolates was observed at the lowest temperatures, consistent with the previous findings (22Baba T. Kaneda K. Kusunose E. Kusunose M. Yano I. J. Biochem. 1989; 106: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, when the same samples were separated on silver nitrate-impregnated TLC plates, we observed the presence of an additional band (referred to as lipid Z) appearing essentially at temperatures lower than 37 °C (Fig. 1B, right panel). Because silver nitrate retards migration of unsaturated lipids relative to cyclopropanated lipids, these results suggested that a new cyclopropanated lipid was produced during growth at low temperatures. Resolution on two-dimensional argentation TLC suggested that the radiolabeled spot accumulating at 25 °C corresponded to cyclopropanated mycolates belonging to the α-mycolate subclass (Fig. 1C). These data support the conclusion that cyclopropanation occurs in M. smegmatis and are strongly enhanced at growth temperatures below 37 °C. An in silico search for genes encoding mycolic acid methyltransferases in M. smegmatis mc2155 revealed the presence of at least seven putative coding regions (18Laval F. Haites R. Movahedzadeh F.

These seven open reading frames are localized to five different loci (Fig. 2A) and share 50–70% identity (Fig. 2B). Two of these, annotated MSMEG_1351 and MSMEG_1350, are present in the mmaA1–mmaA-containing"

The results demonstrate reversibility of the interactions between HCs and glycosaminoglycans and suggest that a dynamic shuffling of the HCs occur in vivo. The bikunin proteins are proteoglycans present in plasma (1.Enghild J.J. Thøgersen I.B. Pizzo S.V. Salvesen G. J. Biol.

In the present study, we show that TSG-6/HC2 is able to continuously shuffle HCs to and from different glycosaminoglycan chains. This suggests that the initial transfer of HCs from the bikunin proteins to HA may be transient as the HC can be moved again to occupy another position on the same HA or to another GAG molecule. This may create a dynamic situation in the extracellular matrix where the HCs are moved around to facilitate the most favorable interactions.

Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using theoretical extinction coefficients (GPMAW software, Lighthouse Data). Samples were boiled shortly in sample buffer containing dithiothreitol. SDS-PAGE was performed in 5–15% gradient gels using the glycine/2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol-HCl system described previously (32.Bury A.F. J.

The tryptic peptides were purified on C18 stage tips (Proxeon Biosystems A/S) and eluted directly onto the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization target using 1 μl of 70% acetonitrile containing 4 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. Mass spectra were acquired in a Micromass Q-TOF Ultima Global mass spectrometer (Waters) operated in positive ion mode (range m/z 800–3000). The instrument was calibrated over the 50–3000 m/z range using a polyethylene glycol mixture. Glu-fibrinopeptide B (m/z 1570.6774) served as an external lock-mass calibrant for each mass spectra. Micromass Masslynx 4.0 data processing software was used to generate a single Mascot-searchable peak list to query the Swiss-Prot protein database (35.Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6811) Google Scholar). The searches were performed using a peptide mass tolerance of 30 ppm and propionamide modification of cysteine residues, and no missed tryptic cleavage sites were allowed. Only significant hits as defined by Mascot probability analysis were accepted. Free bikunin, containing the CS chain, was allowed to react with Alexa Flour 488 for 1 h at ambient temperature, according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The reaction was quenched by the addition of ammonium bicarbonate, and the labeled bikunin was purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography using a C8 column (Brownlee, C8, RP-300, 2.1 × 200 mm). Approximately 2 μg of the labeled protein was incubated with 0.5 μg of TSG-6 alone or in the presence of 3 μg of HC2·bikunin, Pre-α-inhibitor (PαI), or IαI. The proteins were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.6 (TBS) containing either 1 mm MgCl2 or 5 mm EDTA. Finally, the samples were subjected to reduced SDS-PAGE. IαI (3 μg) and TSG-6 (0.4 μg) were incubated at a molar ratio of 3:2 in TBS at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2 or 1 mm EDTA. After 3 h, 0.05 unit of chondroitinase ABC was added. The samples were left incubating for an additional hour at 37 °C, and the reaction products were analyzed by reduced SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. For comparison, IαI was similarly digested with chondroitinase ABC and analyzed by reduced SDS-PAGE. IαI (3 μg) and TSG-6 were incubated at the following molar ratios: 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:5, and 1:7 for 1 h at 37 °C in TBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and analyzed by reduced SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. IαI (3 μg) and TSG-6 (0.6 μg) were incubated in a molar ratio of 1:1 for 2 h at 37 °C in TBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 in the presence or absence of 5 μg of HA oligosaccharides (∼20 disaccharides (HA20)). Afterward, the sample containing HA20 was stored on ice, and HA20 was added to the other sample before it was left incubating for an additional 2 h at 37 °C. Finally, both samples were analyzed by reduced SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. IαI (3 μg) and TSG-6 (0.6 μg) were incubated at a molar ratio of 1:1 for 2 h at 37 °C in TBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 3 μg of HA20, with a molecular mass of ∼3.8 kDa. Then 10 μg of a 12-mer oligosaccharide HA12, with a molecular mass of ∼ 2.3 kDa, was added, and the sample was left incubating for an additional 2 h at 37 °C. For comparison, NaOH-dissociated IαI (5.Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Hefta S.A. Thøgersen I.B. Rutherfurd S. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol.

The possible direct transfer of HCs from one HA to another HA molecule was examined by incubating IαI (18 μg), TSG-6 (2.4 μg) at a 3:2 molar ratio, and HA (30 μg) in TBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 (total volume 120 μl). After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, free bikunin and bikunin·HC complexes were removed by affinity adsorption on 50 μl of anhydrotrypsin-Sepharose. The sample was incubated for 1 h at 23 °C and centrifuged, and the procedure was repeated three times to ensure complete depletion of bikunin-containing proteins. Then the final supernatant was i) analyzed directly, ii) treated with NaOH (5.Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Hefta S.A. Thøgersen I.B. Rutherfurd S. Pizzo S.V. J. Biol.

All samples were finally analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using an antiserum against HC1 and HC2. In addition, the final supernatant (sample i) was subjected to immunoblotting using an anti-bikunin antibody. The incubation with oligo-HA (samples iii and iv) was done for 2 h at 37 °C in TBS containing 1 mm MgCl2 and with the addition of 1 μg of TSG-6. The HCs of the bikunin proteins may serve as an HC donor in the TSG-6/HC2-mediated transfer of HCs to GAGs (14.Rugg M.S. Willis A.C. Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Fries E. Fülöp C. Milner C.M.

This was investigated by fluorescently labeling purified free bikunin (we use the term free bikunin for CS-substituted bikunin, which is not in complex with HCs) and incubating with TSG-6 and different bikunin proteins. Afterward, the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the migration of the labeled bikunin was determined (Fig. 1). The results demonstrate that the CS of free bikunin is able to act as HC acceptor because HCs from IαI and from HC2·bikunin were transferred to the fluorophore-labeled bikunin (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 3). Previously, it has been shown that the HC transfer reaction is HC2- and divalent cation-dependent (14.Rugg M.S. Willis A.C. Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Fries E. Fülöp C. Milner C.M. Day A.J. J.

Therefore, samples without HC2 or without divalent cations were used as negative controls, and as expected, no HC transfer was observed in these samples (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 5–7). The analyses demonstrate that the CS chain of bikunin is both HC donor (as in the bikunin proteins) and HC acceptor (as in free bikunin), demonstrating the reversibility of the HC transfer reaction. The generation of free bikunin during IαI/TSG-6 incubation (15.Sanggaard K.W. Karring H. Valnickova Z. Thøgersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol.

However, our studies show that the ratio between IαI and TSG-6 during incubation determines the variant of bikunin complexes formed (Fig. 2) (15.Sanggaard K.W. Karring H. Valnickova Z. Thøgersen I.B.

If IαI is incubated with a molar excess of TSG-6, a high proportion of the HCs will be involved in HC·TSG-6 complexes, thus decreasing the number of HCs associated with each CS chain. Consequently, the probability of HMW IαI formation is decreased (Fig. 2, lane 7), and the amount of generated free bikunin is increased (15.Sanggaard K.W. Karring H. Valnickova Z. Thøgersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11936-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, if the relative amount of TSG-6 is low, the number of HCs associated with each CS chain remains close to two (as in IαI), and the probability that TSG-6/HC2 transfers an HC to a CS chain already occupied by two HCs is higher (Fig. 2, lane 3), favoring the formation of HMW IαI. Because the HC·bikunin and HC·TSG-6 proteins co-migrate in SDS-PAGE, the amount of each protein is difficult to estimate during SDS-PAGE. Taken together, the experiments show that the IαI/TSG-6 interaction is dynamic and that the ratio between the products of the interaction depend on the ratio between IαI and TSG-6. The ratio determines whether the end products of the interaction primarily are HC·TSG-6 complexes and free bikunin or bikunin with one, two, or more HCs attached. Although IαI before and after TSG-6 incubation migrates in the same position during SDS-PAGE (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5), we speculated that the placement of the HCs on the CS chain had been altered. It has previously been shown that the HCs of authentic IαI resist enzymatic dissociation most likely because of their close proximity, sterically preventing enzyme access (8.Enghild J.J. Thøgersen I.B. Cheng F. Fransson L.A. Roepstorff P. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11804-11813Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We exploited this property and tested whether the ability to enzymatically dissociate the HCs was affected by TSG-6 incubation, indicating that the HCs position had changes. During the experiments, the TSG-6:IαI ratio was kept low (Fig. 2) to ensure that the level of bikunin-HC·HC complexes before and after TSG-6 was the same (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2). Consequently, the amount of bikunin-HC·HC complexes subjected to chondroitinase ABC treatment (Fig. 3, lanes 3–5) was similar in all experiments.FIGURE 4TSG-6/HC2-generated HMW IαI proteins are HC donors. Shown is a Coomassie Blue-stained reduced SDS-PAGE gel showing samples of IαI (lane 1), IαI incubated with TSG-6 (lane 2), IαI incubated with TSG-6 and HA oligosaccharides simultaneously (lane 3), and IαI incubated with TSG-6, where HA oligosaccharides were subsequently added (lane 4). The incubation of IαI and TSG-6 generates HMW IαI, and because only trace amounts of these species are present after a subsequently incubation with HA oligosaccharides, it seems likely that the HMW IαI species serve as HC donors. To confirm the identity of the generated HC·HA complexes, the proteins of interest were excised (bands a–c) and subjected to peptide mass fingerprinting (supplemental Table S1). These analyses demonstrate that band a contains HC1 and HC2, band b contains HC2, and band c contains HC1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3TSG-6/HC2-mediated HC transfer positions the HCs randomly on the bikunin CS. Shown is a Coomassie Blue-stained reduced SDS-PAGE gel of IαI (lane 1), IαI incubated with TSG-6 (lane 2), IαI digested with chondroitinase ABC (ChonABC, lane 3), IαI incubated with TSG-6 in the presence of EDTA and subsequently digested with chondroitinase ABC (lane 4), IαI incubated with TSG-6 and subsequently digested with chondroitinase ABC (lane 5), and chondroitinase ABC alone (lane 6). The experiment shows that after IαI has been exposed to TSG-6, chondroitinase ABC treatment generate only a faint HC1·HC2 band (lane 5), in contrast to the chondroitinase ABC treatment of authentic IαI (lane 3). This suggests that TSG-6/HC2 has rearranged the positions of the HCs on the CS chain, thus facilitating cleavage of the CS between the two HCs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When authentic IαI was treated with chondroitinase ABC, bikunin was readily released, producing an HC·HC band composed of the two CS-linked HCs (Fig. 3, lane 3). Significantly less of the HC·HC band was apparent when IαI was first exposed to TSG-6 and then digested with chondroitinase ABC (Fig. 3, lane 5). This suggests that cleavage between the two HCs was facilitated, supporting that the placement had been altered. HMW IαI was also degraded by chondroitinase ABC, indicating that the HCs similarly had been rearranged. Moreover, inhibition of the TSG-6/HC2 transfer activity (14.Rugg M.S. Willis A.C.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7661-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) prevented chondroitinase ABC from cleaving and releasing the two HCs, supporting that the authentic position was maintained (Fig. 3, lane 4). The original position of the IαI HCs on the CS chain appears to be altered by TSG-6/HC2, as described above. To test whether this relocation affected the ability for further transfer, authentic IαI and TSG-6 were incubated to generate CS containing bikunin with two, three, or four attached HCs. Afterward, HA oligosaccharides were added and finally analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). To confirm the identity of the HC·HA complexes, the bands were excised, and the proteins were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting (supplemental Table S1). The results demonstrate that the TSG-6/HC2-generated bikunin-HC·HC and HMW IαI are HC donors. Hence, the position of the HCs on the CS chain originating from bikunin is not important for the transfer activity to be expressed. The band in which HC1 and HC2 were identified (band a) is most likely HA oligosaccharide with two HCs attached. Indeed, incubation of IαI and TSG-6 with HA oligosaccharides of increasing length reduced the gel migration of that particular band (data not shown), indicating that HA is present in this band. The band is also observed when HA is added after IαI/TSG-6 incubation (Fig. 4, lane 4), although the appearance is weaker. HA is a stronger HC acceptor than C-0-S (18.Mukhopadhyay D. Asari A. Rugg M.S. Day A.J. Fülöp C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11119-11128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and it is not clear whether the HC·HA complexes assembled by TSG-6/HC2 are stable toward additional transfer reactions. To test this, HCs were transferred to HA20 (∼3.8 kDa) (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 4). These complexes were then used as a substrate and incubated in the presence of TSG-6/HC2 and HA12 (∼2.3-kDa) molecule (Fig. 5, lane 3). We found that the HC·HA20 complexes disappeared when incubated with an excess of HA12 (Fig. 5, enlargement), demonstrating that HC·HA complexes are able to function as HC donors. Theoretically the transfer of HCs between HA molecules (Fig. 5) can either occur directly between HA sites or require CS as a transient intermediate. To test this, we prepared HC·HA complexes and removed the bikunin-containing proteins (free bikunin and bikunin·HC(s) complexes) by anhydrotrypsin-Sepharose affinity absorption. Immunoblotting using anti-HC1/anti-HC2 antibodies confirmed that the bikunin proteins had been removed from our sample (Fig. 6, lane 1). HC·HA complexes do not migrate into the gel during SDS-PAGE because of their large size (15.Sanggaard K.W. Karring H. Valnickova Z. Thøgersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11936-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The presence of HC·HA complexes was verified by NaOH treatment of the sample. This procedure released free HC1 and free HC2, strongly suggesting that HC·HA complexes were present (Fig. 6, lane 2). After HC·HA, oligo-HA, and TSG-6 incubation, HC·oligo-HA complexes were apparent (Fig. 6, lane 3). This demonstrates that HCs may be transferred directly from HA to oligo-HA. The sample did not contain free bikunin, as determined by immunoblotting using an anti-bikunin antibody. We have previously demonstrated that in addition to TSG-6, free HC2, HC2·bikunin, or IαI is required for the transfer of HCs (16.Sanggaard K.W. Sonne-Schmidt C.S. Krogager T.P. Lorentzen K.A.

The present experiment suggests that HA-linked HC2 and TSG-6 similarly are able to mediate HC transfer. Taken together, our results support that TSG-6/HC2 may transfer HCs directly from one HA molecule to another. In addition, the analysis supports that HC transfer between bikunin proteins, TSG-6, and GAGs occurs in vivo in a continuous process of dismantling and regeneration. In concert, TSG-6 and HC2 transfer HCs from bikunin proteins to HA in a reaction that involves two sequential transesterifications (14.Rugg M.S. Willis A.C. Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Fries E.

Previously, the generated HC·HA was regarded as the final product of the reactions. In the present study, we show that the HC·HA complex also serves as HC donor in a new cycle of TSG-6/HC2-promoted HC-transfer reactions. If an excess of HA is present during the incubation of IαI and TSG-6, neither HC1·bikunin nor HC2·bikunin is generated (15.Sanggaard K.W. Karring H. Valnickova Z. Thøgersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11936-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting that these products also serve as HC donors. The finding that HC2 derived from HC2·bikunin is transferred to HA supports this conclusion (16.Sanggaard K.W. Sonne-Schmidt C.S. Krogager T.P. Lorentzen K.A. Wisniewski H.G. Thøgersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 18530-18537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The TSG-6/HC2 reaction thus strips the CS chain of the HCs (15.Sanggaard K.W.

Whether the CS chain is stripped of the HCs in vivo probably depends on the ratio between bikunin proteins and HA. In the present study, we show that the generated free bikunin also serves as HC acceptor. Interestingly, free bikunin is synthesized in large amounts by hepatocytes (37.Thøgersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18700-18709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that bikunin proteins could be assembled extracellularly if an HC donor, bikunin, and TSG-6 co-localize at low HA concentrations. HA is a better HC acceptor than C-0-S (18.Mukhopadhyay D. Asari A. Rugg M.S. Day A.J. Fülöp C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11119-11128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) suggesting that transfer of HCs to HA is an irreversible event. However, in the present study, we show that TSG-6/HC2 is able to remove HA-associated HCs, revealing that HC·HA complexes also serve as HC donors, analogous to IαI. Because the HC transfer between HA molecules does not require an intermediate HC·CS complex, the HC shuffling may occur independent of the bikunin proteins in vivo, after the initial transfer of HCs from bikunin proteins to HA. The findings in the present study suggest that the TSG-6/bikunin protein interaction in HA-rich extracellular matrix is dynamic. As long as the reactants co-localize, a continuous shuffling of HCs between GAGs probably takes place. In the present study, we have analyzed the interactions between IαI, TSG-6, and HA. The results show no significant difference between the requirements for acceptor GAG and donor GAG. The TSG-6/HC2-generated HC·GAG complexes are able to function as donor HC·GAG complexes. Contrariwise, is the TSG-6/HC2-stripped CS chain from IαI able to function as an HC acceptor GAG. Taken together, the study demonstrates the reversibility of the TSG-6/HC2-mediated transfer of HCs to GAGs. We thank Tania Aaquist Nielsen for technical assistance.

Previously, we demonstrated that protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) inhibits F1F0 activity via an interaction with the “d” subunit of F1F0-ATP synthase (dF1F0) in neonatal cardiac myocytes (NCMs) (Nguyen, T., Ogbi, M., and Johnson, J.

Incubation of NCMs with versions of these peptides containing HIV-Tat protein transduction and mammalian mitochondrial targeting sequences resulted in their delivery into mitochondria.

The heart consumes large amounts of ATP, and even though cardiac ATP levels do not change substantially in times of intense activity (due to buffering systems such as creatinine kinase), the F1F0 synthase is largely responsible for replenishing the ATP that is used. Despite such modest changes in high energy phosphate levels during strenuous activity, the F1F0-ATP synthase is fully capable of responding to increased ATP expenditure. This indicates that in vivo the enzyme is not only regulated by substrate availability but is additionally regulated by biochemical events, such as protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation. There is also evidence that in cardiovascular disease states the F1F0-ATP synthase may lose its capacity to increase its activity in response to cellular ATP demands (3.Harris D.A. Das A.M. Biochem.

Following severe cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury, the type of damage sustained in a heart attack, ATP levels also decline substantially (9.Das A.M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2003; 79: 71-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 10.Solaini G. Harris D.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 377-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A major component of this drop involves the loss of the mitochondrial IM proton gradient that supplies the energy for F1F0-ATP synthase. Therefore, in the early phases of myocardial ischemia, the F1F0-ATP synthase becomes inhibited. It then makes a futile attempt to re-establish mitochondrial IM potential by pumping protons out of the mitochondrial matrix. This process requires energy, which is supplied by the F1F0 complex, then operating as an ATPase (7.Green D.W. Grover G.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10.Solaini G. Harris D.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 377-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). If ischemia is not interrupted, F1F0-ATPase activity contributes heavily to the loss of myocardial ATP (7.Green D.W. Grover G.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10.Solaini G. Harris D.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 377-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In addition, the return of aerobic ATP synthesis is impaired following IR injury, but the mechanisms for this delay are not completely known. Under ischemic conditions, the heart attempts to compensate by using glucose as a preferred substrate (instead of predominantly fatty acids) in anaerobic glycolysis. However, anaerobic ATP production is not sufficient to supply the extensive cardiac demands for energy, and it also generates considerable lactic acid, which damages the heart further. The consequent decreases in pH inhibit glycolytic enzymes (7.Green D.W. Grover G.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10.Solaini G. Harris D.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 377-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). An accelerated return of aerobic ATP production, following IR injury, would therefore improve the survival of cardiac cells, making the F1F0-ATP synthase/ATPase a logical focus of cardiac IR research. Previous studies have proposed that cardiac pre-conditioning (PC), a cardioprotective response against IR injury, inhibits F1F0-ATPase mode activity (13.Vuorinen K. Ylitalo K. Peuhkurinen K. Raatikainen P. Ala-Rämi A. Hassinen I.E. Circulation. 1995; 91: 2810-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 14.Takeo S. Nasa Y. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 32-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This could contribute protection by reducing ATP hydrolysis after ischemic insults. There have also been reports that PC induces an improved recovery of cardiac ATP levels following prolonged IR injury (10.Solaini G. Harris D.A. Biochem. J. 2005; 390: 377-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 15.Murphy E. Steenbergen C. Physiol. Rev. 2008; 88: 581-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar, 16.Vogt A.M. Elsässer A.

This is consistent with the hypothesis that cardiac PC may improve F1F0-ATP synthase-mode activity as well. However, to date, the precise roles of the F1F0 complex in cardiac IR injury and PC are not fully understood. Mitochondrial mechanisms involving protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes in cardiac PC and IR injury have received considerable attention (17.Nguyen T. Ogbi M. Guo D. Johnson J.A. Curr. Enzyme Inhib. 2007; 3: 143-159Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 18.Liang B.T. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 1997; 273: H847-H853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Baines C.P. Song C.X.

Identification of the particular isozyme(s) that is involved in these responses is an essential prerequisite for the development of clinically useful pharmacological mimetic agents. In support of this, previous studies have reported a PKCϵ-selective facilitator peptide, and a PKCδ inhibitor peptide can induce cardio-protection from IR injury in cardiomyocytes (22.Gray M.O.

The above-mentioned PKCδ inhibitor has also shown great promise in human clinical trials targeting damage from acute myocardial infarction (27.Bates E. Bode C. Costa M. Gibson C.M. Granger C. Green C. Grimes K. Harrington R. Huber K. Kleiman N. Mochly-Rosen D. Roe M. Sadowski Z. Solomon S. Widimsky P. Circulation. 2008; 117: 886-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a PKCδ-selective translocation inhibitor, administered immediately following a prolonged ischemic insult, improved the recovery of mouse heart ATP levels during oxygenated reperfusion (25.Inagaki K. Chen L. Ikeno F. Lee F.H. Imahashi K. Bouley D.M. Rezaee M. Yock P.G. Murphy E. Mochly-Rosen D. Circulation. 2003; 108: 2304-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In this study, we have identified the first cell-permeable, mitochondrially targeted PKCδ-dF1F0 interaction inhibitor and facilitator peptides. We have determined that these peptides modulate the interaction between PKCδ and dF1F0 and, consequently, F1F0 activity in NCMs. We propose that excessive inhibition of the F1F0-ATP synthase by PKCδ may play a significant role in cardiac pathology and that our novel peptides could provide a mechanism for investigating these effects. NCMs were isolated from the hearts of 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (28.Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29.Johnson J.A. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This study was conducted in accordance with Institutional, State, and Federal guidelines for the humane care and use of laboratory animals. Briefly, cells were obtained from hearts by gentle trypsinization at room temperature, and dissociated cells were preplated for 40 min onto 100-mm dishes in medium 199 (M-199) (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories). The nonattached cells were plated onto 35- or 100-mm Corning Petri dishes at a density of 800 cells/mm2 and incubated at 37 °C in humidified air with 1% CO2. Myocytes were cultured in M-199 supplemented with vitamin B12 (1.5 mmol/liter), penicillin G (50 units/ml), 0.1 mmol/liter bromodeoxyuridine, and 10% fetal bovine serum through day 4. After the 4th day, cells were then placed in defined M-199 containing 50 units/ml penicillin G, 1.5 mmol/liter vitamin B12, and 10 μg/ml each of transferrin and insulin. The 14 sequential dF1F0-derived peptides (1 15-mer, 12 16-mers, and 1 18-mer) covering the entire 161-amino acid sequence of dF1F0 were synthesized by 21st Century Biochemicals (Marlborough, MA) using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. Each peptide had a 5-amino acid overlap with the previous peptide. Final sequences of these peptides are shown in Table 1. Several modifications were made to some of the peptides to more closely mimic the physiological forms of the amino acids found in the native dF1F0 protein. For example, we did not include the first methionine in dF1F0 sequence, as the National Center for Biotechnology Education database indicates that this methionine is not present in the final mature form of dF1F0. In addition, we have added N-acetyl and C-carboxyamide groups to the N and C terminus of each peptide, respectively, to properly mimic the peptide bonds normally present in the native protein. Because peptide 14 represents the actual C terminus of the protein, this peptide was made as a free C-terminal carboxyl. Finally, there are several lysines in the native protein (e.g. amino acids 63, 78, 85, 99, 117, and 149) that were incorporated into peptides as N-acetyl-lysines. All peptides were high pressure liquid chromatography-purified (purity ≥90%), and their masses and sequences were verified by collision-induced fragmentation using a Qo-TOF electrospray ionization-mass spectrometer (QSTAR XL Pro, MDX Sciex). All of the peptides were finished as acetate salts, and endotoxin-free water was used for all peptide purification and formulations.TABLE 1Description of sequential peptides derived from the d subunit of adult rat dF1F0PeptideAmino acid sequence1NH2-2AGRKLALKTIDWVSF16-COOH2NH2-12DWVSFVEIMPQNQKAI27-COOH3NH2-23NQKAIGNALKSWNETF38-COOH4NH2-34WNETFHTRLASLSEKP49-COOH5NH2-45LSEKPPAIDWAYYRAN60-COOH6NH2-56YYRANVDKPGLVDDFK71-COOH7NH2-67VDDFKNKYNALKIPVP82-COOH8NH2-78KIPVPEDKYTALVDAE93-COOH9NH2-89LVDAEEKEDVKNCAQF104-COOH10NH2-100NCAQFVTGSQARVREY115-COOH11NH2-111RVREYEKQLEKIKNMI126-COOH12NH2-122IKNMIPFDQMTIDDLN137-COOH13NH2-133IDDLNEVFPETKLDKR148-COOH14NH2-144KLDKRKYPYWPHQPIENL161-COOH Open table in a new tab Syntheses for cell-permeable, mitochondrially targeted PKCδ-dF1F0 interaction inhibitor and facilitator peptides were as follows. Each peptide included either the PKCδ-dF1F0 interaction antagonist NH2-2AGRKLALKTIDWVSF16-COOH or agonist NH2-111RVREYEKQLEKIKNMI126-COOH sequence. An HIV-Tat protein-transducing sequence YGRKKRRQRRR was also placed at the N terminus of each peptide using a cysteine-cysteine linkage as described previously (30.Chen L. Wright L.R. Chen C.H. Oliver S.F. Wender P.A. Mochly-Rosen D. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 1123-1129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Following the Tat sequence, we included a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MLATRALSLIGKRAISTSVC) derived from the number IV subunit of cytochrome oxidase (31.Lemire B.D. Fankhauser C. Baker A. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20206-20215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, a FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was also attached to the C-terminal end of each peptide to monitor their uptake into mitochondria. As a control, a scrambled (inactive) (ADKIGWAVLRTKSLF) version of the PKCδ-dF1F0 inhibitor peptide was synthesized with all of the above HIV-Tat, mitochondrial targeting and FLAG domains. The final overall sequence of each of these peptides is shown in Fig. 1A. Isolation of the F1F0-ATP synthase holoenzyme by chromatography was performed as described previously in detail by Buchanan and Walker (32.Buchanan S.K. Walker J.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria were isolated from five adult Sprague-Dawley rats and were then washed in phosphate buffer and solubilized in buffer containing 20 mm ATP, 20 mm MgSO4, 0.001% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% n-dodecyl-β,d-maltoside. The solubilized mitochondria were precipitated with ammonium sulfate. The ammonium sulfate pellet was resuspended in buffer and dialyzed overnight to remove lipids. The sample was then loaded onto a Q-Sepharose anion exchange column. The F1F0-ATP synthase holoenzyme was then eluted using a linear NaCl gradient (from 0 to 1 m), and peak F1F0-ATPase fractions were initially identified by the F1F0-ATPase activity assay. Subsequently, the presence of the α, β, and d subunits of the F1F0-ATPase was confirmed in peak F1F0-ATPase activity fractions by Western blots using antisera against each of these subunits. Peak fractions were then pooled and used for overlay binding and other assays. Antisera for the α, β, and d subunits of the F1F0-ATPase were obtained from Molecular Probes and Mitosciences and were used in Western blots. The overlay method to detect PKC-binding partners was described previously by Mochly-Rosen and co-workers (33.Schechtman D. Mochly-Rosen D. Ron D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2003; 233: 345-350PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Ron D. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 35.Mochly-Rosen D. Khaner H.

U.S.A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Required activators and co-factors of PKC such as calcium (Ca2+), phosphatidylserine (PS, Avanti, Alabaster, AL), and diacylglycerol (DG, Avanti) were included in the assay. Purified F1F0 holoenzyme (50 μg) was separated by 13.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose paper (NCP). The blots were then cut into strips (0.3 × 5.5 cm) and washed briefly with distilled water. The membrane was then blocked with overlay blocking buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 3% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% polyethylene glycol) for 1 h at room temperature. Next, the strips were incubated with overlay buffer containing purified PKC (50 μg/ml) and co-factors for 1 h at room temperature. The strips were washed four times for 5 min with overlay wash buffer. Bound PKC was detected with PKC-isozyme antisera and ECL detection as described below for Western blot analyses. 100-mm dishes of NCMs were used for mitochondria isolation. The culture medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with Ca2+/Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline containing 1.4 nm calyculin A and 1.44 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate (NaPPi). Cells were scraped from the dishes in 400 μl of isotonic MSE buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 0.025% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm taurine, 1.6 mm carnitine, 1.5 mm NaPPi, 1.5 nm calyculin A, and 10 μg/ml protease inhibitors) containing 100 units/ml trypsin (Sigma) for 20 min on ice. After the incubation period, cells were then subjected to Dounce homogenization. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged twice at 600 × g for 5 min to pellet nuclei and cell debris. Protease inhibitors were added to the final supernatant at 10 μg/ml each, and it was then loaded onto a Percoll/Optiprep gradient as described below (37.Ogbi M. Johnson J.A. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 38.Guo D. Nguyen T. Ogbi M. Tawfik H. Ma G. Yu Q. Caldwell R.W. Johnson J.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 293: H2219-H2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The postnuclear supernatant (prepared as described above) was layered over a combination Percoll/Optiprep (Accurate Chemical and Scientific, Westbury, NY) gradient prepared on the same day as follows. Each gradient was prepared in Beckman-Ultraclear 14 × 89-mm centrifuge tubes. The first step in gradient formation involved overlaying 1.74 ml of a 17% (v/v) Optiprep solution on a 1.74-ml cushion of 35% Optiprep solution. Next, 4.35 ml of a 6% (v/v) Percoll solution was layered on top of the 17% Optiprep solution. All Optiprep and Percoll solutions were prepared using MSE buffer as the diluent. Gradients were stored on ice until use. Next, 4.2 ml of postnuclear supernatant was gently layered on top of the 6% Percoll portion of the gradient. All tubes were centrifuged in a Beckman SW.41 swinging bucket rotor at 50,000 × g for 30 min using the lowest acceleration and deceleration speeds. Mitochondria were collected at the 17/35% Optiprep interface from each gradient using a Pasteur pipette and placed on ice until use. The antisera against the “d” subunit of the F1F0-ATPase (dF1F0) from Molecular Probes (50 μg) was coupled with Bio-Rad Affi-Gel (1 ml) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The IP was performed as described previously (37.Ogbi M. Johnson J.A. Biochem. J. 2006; 393: 191-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 38.Guo D. Nguyen T. Ogbi M. Tawfik H. Ma G. Yu Q. Caldwell R.W. Johnson J.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 293: H2219-H2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with the addition of 150 mm NaCl to the IP buffer in the three final wash steps. The oligomycin-sensitive activity of F1F0-ATPase activity was measured using a spectrophotometric assay as described previously (32.Buchanan S.K. Walker J.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scraped and lysed by sonication in 400 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, and 1 mm EGTA. The F1F0-ATPase activity then was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the disappearance of NADH, which manifests as a decline in absorbance at 340 nm as NADH is oxidized NAD+. The final F1F0-ATPase assay buffer contained 25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 83 mm sucrose, 4 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm KCN, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm ATP, 1.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 5 units of pyruvate kinase, 5 units of lactate dehydrogenase, and 75 μm NADH in a 1-ml cuvette. All assay reagents were obtained from Sigma. The assay was monitored continuously for 1–3 min at 25 °C in the absence and presence of oligomycin (8 μg/ml). Western blotting was carried out as described previously (28.Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Karliner J.S. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29.Johnson J.A. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 654-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) using ECL detection (GE Healthcare). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12–13.5% acrylamide gels and then transferred onto NCP. The resulting blots were probed for PKC isozymes and F1F0 subunits. PKC antisera were obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories or Santa Cruz Biotechnology; F1F0 antisera were obtained from Invitrogen, and the FLAG antibody was obtained from Sigma. Differences between two groups were assessed using unpaired Student's t test, and comparisons among multiple groups were made using one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni's post hoc test. A p value ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Our previous studies in NCMs demonstrated an interaction between PKCδ and the d subunit of F1F0-ATP synthase (dF1F0), which correlated with 4β-PMA- and hypoxia-induced inhibition of F1F0-ATPase activity (39.Nguyen T. Ogbi M. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29831-29840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We next surveyed which amino acid sequence(s) within the dF1F0 protein was responsible for its binding to PKCδ. Currently, there are no commercially available recombinant sources of mammalian dF1F0 protein. For this reason, we synthesized 14 sequential peptides (Table 1) covering the entire amino acid sequence of dF1F0 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We have previously demonstrated that PKCδ, but not PKCα, -ϵ, or -ζ, selectively binds to the dF1F0 protein in overlay assays (39.Nguyen T. Ogbi M. Johnson J.A. J. Biol."
https://openalex.org/W2146909057,"There are 13 Dictyostelium Src homology 2 (SH2) domain proteins, almost 10-fold fewer than in mammals, and only three are functionally unassigned. One of these, LrrB, contains a novel combination of protein interaction domains: an SH2 domain and a leucine-rich repeat domain. Growth and early development appear normal in the mutant, but expression profiling reveals that three genes active at these stages are greatly underexpressed: the ttdA metallohydrolase, the abcG10 small molecule transporter, and the cinB esterase. In contrast, the multigene family encoding the lectin discoidin 1 is overexpressed in the disruptant strain. LrrB binds to 14-3-3 protein, and the level of binding is highest during growth and decreases during early development. Comparative tandem affinity purification tagging shows that LrrB also interacts, via its SH2 domain and in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner, with two novel proteins: CldA and CldB. Both of these proteins contain a Clu domain, a >200-amino acid sequence present within highly conserved eukaryotic proteins required for correct mitochondrial dispersal. A functional interaction of LrrB with CldA is supported by the fact that a cldA disruptant mutant also underexpresses ttdA, abcG10, and cinB. Significantly, CldA is itself one of the three functionally unassigned SH2 domain proteins. Thus, just as in metazoa, but on a vastly reduced numerical scale, an interacting network of SH2 domain proteins regulates specific Dictyostelium gene expression."
