https://openalex.org/W2956228567,"The development of decision support systems for pathology and their deployment in clinical practice have been hindered by the need for large manually annotated datasets. To overcome this problem, we present a multiple instance learning-based deep learning system that uses only the reported diagnoses as labels for training, thereby avoiding expensive and time-consuming pixel-wise manual annotations. We evaluated this framework at scale on a dataset of 44,732 whole slide images from 15,187 patients without any form of data curation. Tests on prostate cancer, basal cell carcinoma and breast cancer metastases to axillary lymph nodes resulted in areas under the curve above 0.98 for all cancer types. Its clinical application would allow pathologists to exclude 65-75% of slides while retaining 100% sensitivity. Our results show that this system has the ability to train accurate classification models at unprecedented scale, laying the foundation for the deployment of computational decision support systems in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2960372990,"Characterized primarily by a low body-mass index, anorexia nervosa is a complex and serious illness1, affecting 0.9–4% of women and 0.3% of men2–4, with twin-based heritability estimates of 50–60%5. Mortality rates are higher than those in other psychiatric disorders6, and outcomes are unacceptably poor7. Here we combine data from the Anorexia Nervosa Genetics Initiative (ANGI)8,9 and the Eating Disorders Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC-ED) and conduct a genome-wide association study of 16,992 cases of anorexia nervosa and 55,525 controls, identifying eight significant loci. The genetic architecture of anorexia nervosa mirrors its clinical presentation, showing significant genetic correlations with psychiatric disorders, physical activity, and metabolic (including glycemic), lipid and anthropometric traits, independent of the effects of common variants associated with body-mass index. These results further encourage a reconceptualization of anorexia nervosa as a metabo-psychiatric disorder. Elucidating the metabolic component is a critical direction for future research, and paying attention to both psychiatric and metabolic components may be key to improving outcomes. Genome-wide analyses identify eight independent loci associated with anorexia nervosa. Genetic correlations implicate both psychiatric and metabolic components in the etiology of this disorder, even after adjusting for the effects of common variants associated with body mass index."
https://openalex.org/W2958578938,"Chromatin topology is intricately linked to gene expression, yet its functional requirement remains unclear. Here, we comprehensively assessed the interplay between genome topology and gene expression using highly rearranged chromosomes (balancers) spanning ~75% of the Drosophila genome. Using transheterozyte (balancer/wild-type) embryos, we measured allele-specific changes in topology and gene expression in cis, while minimizing trans effects. Through genome sequencing, we resolved eight large nested inversions, smaller inversions, duplications and thousands of deletions. These extensive rearrangements caused many changes to chromatin topology, disrupting long-range loops, topologically associating domains (TADs) and promoter interactions, yet these are not predictive of changes in expression. Gene expression is generally not altered around inversion breakpoints, indicating that mis-appropriate enhancer–promoter activation is a rare event. Similarly, shuffling or fusing TADs, changing intra-TAD connections and disrupting long-range inter-TAD loops does not alter expression for the majority of genes. Our results suggest that properties other than chromatin topology ensure productive enhancer–promoter interactions. Systematic analysis of highly rearranged balancer chromosomes in Drosophila shows that extensive changes to chromatin topology affect the expression of only a subset of genes."

https://openalex.org/W2961626135,"Bacterial trans-acyltransferase polyketide synthases (trans-AT PKSs) are among the most complex known enzymes from secondary metabolism and are responsible for the biosynthesis of highly diverse bioactive polyketides. However, most of these metabolites remain uncharacterized, since trans-AT PKSs frequently occur in poorly studied microbes and feature a remarkable array of non-canonical biosynthetic components with poorly understood functions. As a consequence, genome-guided natural product identification has been challenging. To enable de novo structural predictions for trans-AT PKS-derived polyketides, we developed the trans-AT PKS polyketide predictor (TransATor). TransATor is a versatile bio- and chemoinformatics web application that suggests informative chemical structures for even highly aberrant trans-AT PKS biosynthetic gene clusters, thus permitting hypothesis-based, targeted biotechnological discovery and biosynthetic studies. We demonstrate the applicative scope in several examples, including the characterization of new variants of bioactive natural products as well as structurally new polyketides from unusual bacterial sources."
https://openalex.org/W2960849493,"The microbiome is increasingly implicated in immune regulation and mortality from sepsis. Mice with identical genetic backgrounds but distinct microbiomes were obtained from different vendors and analyzed following cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). β diversity of the microbiome measured from feces demonstrated significant differences between The Jackson Laboratory (Jax; Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and Charles River Laboratories (CR; Wilmington, MA, USA) C57/B6 mice. Jax mice had 7-d mortality of 90% following CLP, whereas CR mice had a mortality of 53%. Differences in vendor were associated with altered immunophenotype with increased splenic IFN-γ+CD4+ T cells, effector memory CD4+ T cells, and central memory CD4+ T cells and increased Peyer's patch effector memory CD4+ T cells in septic CR mice. To determine whether differences in the microbiome were responsible for these differences, Jax and CR mice were cohoused for 3 wk, after which they assumed a similar microbiota composition. Cohoused mice had improved survival following CLP compared to Jax mice and had similar survival regardless of their vendor of origin. All differences in immunophenotype between septic Jax and CR mice disappeared following cohousing. These findings suggest that the microbiome plays a crucial role in survival and the host immune response from sepsis and represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention.-Fay, K. T., Klingensmith, N. J., Chen, C.-W., Zhang, W., Sun, Y., Morrow, K. N., Liang, Z., Burd, E. M., Ford, M. L., Coopersmith, C. M. The gut microbiome alters immunophenotype and survival from sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2959211930,"Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) is a transcription factor involved in various cellular processes such as glucose metabolism, development, stress resistance, and tumor suppression. FOXO1's transcriptional activity is controlled by different environmental cues through a myriad of posttranslational modifications. In response to growth factors, the serine/threonine kinase AKT phosphorylates Thr24 and Ser256 in FOXO1 to stimulate binding of 14-3-3 proteins, causing FOXO1 inactivation. In contrast, low nutrient and energy levels induce FOXO1 activity. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, partly mediates this effect through phosphorylation of Ser383 and Thr649 in FOXO1. In this study, we identified Ser22 as an additional AMPK phosphorylation site in FOXO1's N terminus, with Ser22 phosphorylation preventing binding of 14-3-3 proteins. The crystal structure of a FOXO1 peptide in complex with 14-3-3 σ at 2.3 A resolution revealed that this is a consequence of both steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion. Furthermore, we found that AMPK-mediated Ser22 phosphorylation impairs Thr24 phosphorylation by AKT in a hierarchical manner. Thus, numerous mechanisms maintain FOXO1 activity via AMPK signaling. AMPK-mediated Ser22 phosphorylation directly and indirectly averts binding of 14-3-3 proteins, whereas phosphorylation of Ser383 and Thr649 complementarily stimulates FOXO1 activity. Our results shed light on a mechanism that integrates inputs from both AMPK and AKT signaling pathways in a small motif to fine-tune FOXO1 transcriptional activity."
https://openalex.org/W2962181909,"Water strongly influences the physical properties of the mantle and enhances its ability to melt or convect. Its presence can also be used to trace recycling of surface reservoirs down to the deep mantle1, which makes knowledge of the water content in the Earth's interior and its evolution crucial for understanding global geodynamics. Komatiites (MgO-rich ultramafic magmas) result from a high degree of mantle melting at high pressures2 and thus are excellent probes of the chemical composition and water contents of the deep mantle. An excess of water over elements that show similar geochemical behaviour during mantle melting (for example, cerium) was recently found in melt inclusions in the most magnesium-rich olivine in 2.7-billion-year-old komatiites from Canada3 and Zimbabwe4. These data were taken as evidence for a deep hydrated mantle reservoir, probably the transition zone, in the Neoarchaean era (2.8 to 2.5 billion years ago). Here we confirm the mantle source of this water by measuring deuterium-to-hydrogen ratios in these melt inclusions and present similar data for 3.3-billion-year-old komatiites from the Barberton greenstone belt. From the hydrogen isotope ratios, we show that the mantle sources of these melts contained excess water, which implies that a deep hydrous mantle reservoir has been present in the Earth's interior since at least the Palaeoarchaean era (3.6 to 3.2 billion years ago). The reconstructed initial hydrogen isotope composition of komatiites is more depleted in deuterium than surface reservoirs or typical mantle but resembles that of oceanic crust that was initially altered by seawater and then dehydrated during subduction. Together with an excess of chlorine and depletion of lead in the mantle sources of komatiites, these results indicate that seawater-altered lithosphere recycling into the deep mantle, arguably by subduction, started before 3.3 billion years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2958796580,"Assessment of genetic diversity and population structure in crops is essential for breeding and germplasm conservation. A collection of 354 bread wheat genotypes, including Mediterranean landraces and modern cultivars representative of the ones most widely grown in the Mediterranean Basin, were characterized with 11196 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Total genetic diversity (HT) and polymorphic information content (PIC) were 0.36 and 0.30 respectively for both landraces and modern cultivars. Linkage disequilibrium for the modern cultivars was higher than for the landraces (0.18 and 0.12, respectively). Analysis of the genetic structure showed a clear geographical pattern for the landraces, which were clustered into three subpopulations (SPs) representing the western, northern and eastern Mediterranean, whereas the modern cultivars were structured according to the breeding programmes that developed them: CIMMYT/ICARDA, France/Italy, and Balkan/eastern European countries. The modern cultivars showed higher genetic differentiation (GST) and lower gene flow (0.1673 and 2.49, respectively) than the landraces (0.1198 and 3.67, respectively), indicating a better distinction between subpopulations. The maximum gene flow was observed between landraces from the northern Mediterranean SPs and the modern cultivars released mainly by French and Italian breeding programmes."
https://openalex.org/W2957745980,"Seaweeds represent a vast resource that remains underutilized as an ingredient in aquafeeds. Here we probed the effect of addition of AquaArom, a seaweed meal derived from brown seaweeds (Laminaria sp., kelp), to fish feed on growth performance, antioxidant capacity and temperature responsiveness of mitochondrial respiration. A commercial salmonid feed was mixed with 0 (control), 3, 6 and 10% seaweed and fed to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts for 30 days. The smolts consumed more of the seaweed-supplemented food relative to the control and there were no mortalities. Compared with the control, the final fish weight, standard length, weight gain and SGR were higher in fish fed diets supplemented with the 3 and 10% seaweed, while growth performance for fish maintained on 6% seaweed remained neutral. Importantly, seaweed supplementation increased protein efficiency ratio (PER) and tended to improve food conversion ratio (FCR). Although the hepatosomatic and visceral indices did not change, whole gut and intestinal weights and lengths were higher in fish maintained on seaweed-supplemented diets suggesting increased retention time and a larger surface area for food digestion and nutrient absorption. Measurement of antioxidant status revealed that seaweed supplementation dose-dependently increased plasma total antioxidant capacity as well as the level of glutathione, and activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase in liver mitochondria. Moreover, seaweed supplementation reduced the effect of acute temperature rise on mitochondrial respiration and proton leak. Overall, these data suggest that AquaArom can be mixed with fish food up to 10% to increase food consumption and enhance growth performance, as well as to improve antioxidant capacity and alleviate adverse effects of stressors such as temperature in fish."
https://openalex.org/W2958260438,"The deposition of aggregated amyloid-β peptides derived from the pro-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precurson protein (APP) into characteristic amyloid plaques (APs) is distinctive to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Alternative APP processing via the metalloprotease ADAM10 prevents amyloid-β formation. We tested whether downregulation of ADAM10 activity by its secreted endogenous inhibitor secreted-frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1) is a common trait of sporadic AD. We demonstrate that SFRP1 is significantly increased in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with AD, accumulates in APs and binds to amyloid-β, hindering amyloid-β protofibril formation. Sfrp1 overexpression in an AD-like mouse model anticipates the appearance of APs and dystrophic neurites, whereas its genetic inactivation or the infusion of α-SFRP1-neutralizing antibodies favors non-amyloidogenic APP processing. Decreased Sfrp1 function lowers AP accumulation, improves AD-related histopathological traits and prevents long-term potentiation loss and cognitive deficits. Our study unveils SFRP1 as a crucial player in AD pathogenesis and a promising AD therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2957628858,"Reconstructing the detailed dietary behaviour of extinct hominins is challenging1—particularly for a species such as Australopithecus africanus, which has a highly variable dental morphology that suggests a broad diet2,3. The dietary responses of extinct hominins to seasonal fluctuations in food availability are poorly understood, and nursing behaviours even less so; most of the direct information currently available has been obtained from high-resolution trace-element geochemical analysis of Homo sapiens (both modern and fossil), Homo neanderthalensis4 and living apes5. Here we apply high-resolution trace-element analysis to two A. africanus specimens from Sterkfontein Member 4 (South Africa), dated to 2.6–2.1 million years ago. Elemental signals indicate that A. africanus infants predominantly consumed breast milk for the first year after birth. A cyclical elemental pattern observed following the nursing sequence—comparable to the seasonal dietary signal that is seen in contemporary wild primates and other mammals—indicates irregular food availability. These results are supported by isotopic evidence for a geographical range that was dominated by nutritionally depauperate areas. Cyclical accumulation of lithium in A. africanus teeth also corroborates the idea that their range was characterized by fluctuating resources, and that they possessed physiological adaptations to this instability. This study provides insights into the dietary cycles and ecological behaviours of A. africanus in response to food availability, including the potential cyclical resurgence of milk intake during times of nutritional challenge (as observed in modern wild orangutans5). The geochemical findings for these teeth reinforce the unique place of A. africanus in the fossil record, and indicate dietary stress in specimens that date to shortly before the extinction of Australopithecus in South Africa about two million years ago. Trace-element analysis of teeth from the hominin Australopithecus africanus, dated to 2.6–2.1 million years ago, sheds light on the weaning sequence of this species and its responses to seasonal food scarcity"
https://openalex.org/W2958658855,"The tumor microenvironment and proinflammatory signals significantly alter glycosylation of cell-surface proteins on endothelial cells. By altering the N-glycosylation machinery in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, proinflammatory cytokines promote the modification of endothelial glycoproteins such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) with sialic acid–capped N-glycans. VEGFR2 is a highly N-glycosylated receptor tyrosine kinase involved in pro-angiogenic signaling in physiological and pathological contexts, including cancer. Here, using glycoside hydrolase and kinase assays and immunoprecipitation and MS-based analyses, we demonstrate that N-linked glycans at the Asn-247 site in VEGFR2 hinder VEGF ligand–mediated receptor activation and signaling in endothelial cells. We provide evidence that cell surface–associated VEGFR2 displays sialylated N-glycans at Asn-247 and, in contrast, that the nearby sites Asn-145 and Asn-160 contain lower levels of sialylated N-glycans and higher levels of high–mannose N-glycans, respectively. Furthermore, we report that VEGFR2 Asn-247–linked glycans capped with sialic acid oppose ligand-mediated VEGFR2 activation, whereas the uncapped asialo-glycans favor activation of this receptor. We propose that N-glycosylation, specifically the capping of N-glycans at Asn-247 by sialic acid, tunes ligand-dependent activation and signaling of VEGFR2 in endothelial cells.

https://openalex.org/W2960688982,"This study aims to evaluate the association between smartphone use and suicide attempts, independent of possible confounders, including conflicts with family/friends and poor academic performance due to smartphone use. Data were obtained from the 2017 Korea Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey, a nationally representative survey of middle- and high-school students (N = 62,276). Time spent using a smartphone was divided into four categories: less than 1 h, 1-2 h, 3-4 h, and 5 h or more a day. The association of conflicts with family due to smartphone use, conflicts with friends due to smartphone use, and poor academic performance due to smartphone use with suicide attempts and time spent using a smartphone were analyzed using multiple and binary logistic regression analyses, respectively. The relationship between time spent on a smartphone and suicide attempts was analyzed using a multiple logistic regression analysis. All analyses were also stratified according to the main purpose of smartphone use (process purposes/social purposes). Conflicts with family/friends due to smartphone use was significantly associated with suicide attempts (P <0.001). The variables of conflicts with family, conflicts with friends and poor academic performance were also proportionally related to higher smartphone use (P <0.001). The use of a smartphone was significantly associated with suicide attempts in a multiple logistic regression analysis (adjusted odds ratio for smartphone use 5 h or more a day 2.16; 95% CI 2.07-2.26; P <0.001), and the association was more prominent with smartphone use for process purposes. Conflicts with family, conflicts with friends, poor academic performance, and suicide attempts were related to higher smartphone use in Korean adolescents. Time spent on a smartphone was positively related to suicide attempts, even after adjusting for conflicts with family members or friends and poor academic performance due to smartphone use."

Iron oxide nanoparticles can be applied for the detection and analysis of biomolecules, target drug delivery, as MRI contrast agents and as therapeutic agents for hyperthermia-based cancer treatments. In this study, we investigated three bioengineered silks, MS1, MS2 and EMS2, and their potential to form a composite material with magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs). The presence of IONPs did not impede the self-assembly properties of MS1, MS2, and EMS2 silks, and spheres formed. The EMS2 spheres had the highest content of IONPs, and the presence of magnetite IONPs in these carriers was confirmed by several methods such as SEM, EDXS, SQUID, MIP-OES and zeta potential measurement. The interaction of EMS2 and IONPs did not modify the superparamagnetic properties of the IONPs, but it influenced the secondary structure of the spheres. The composite particles exhibited a more than two-fold higher loading efficiency for doxorubicin than the plain EMS2 spheres. For both the EMS2 and EMS2/IONP spheres, the drug revealed a pH-dependent release profile with advantageous kinetics for carriers made of the composite material. The composite spheres can be potentially applied for a combined cancer treatment via hyperthermia and drug delivery."

Here, we examined the association between long working hours/sleep-related problems and near-misses/injuries in industrial settings using a nationally representative sample of workers in Japan. Based on the composition ratio of workers by industry, sex, and age in Japan, data from a web-based cross-sectional survey for 18,682 participant full-time workers (7,098 female and 11,584 male; mean age, 43.7 [standard deviation 11.1] years) were analyzed. Nearly 30% and 5% of participants reported any types of near-misses during the past six months and injuries during the past year, respectively. For all types of near-misses and some types of injuries, a significant difference in frequency distribution was observed by industry. After adjustment for demographic, job-, and life-related variables, participants who worked long hours (i.e., more than 51 hours per week) were more likely to report job-related near-misses/injuries than those who worked 35–40 hours per week. The presence of sleep-related problems was also significantly related to near-misses and injuries. However, while sleep-related problems were significantly associated with near-misses/injuries in all industries, the association between long working hours and near-misses/injuries differed by industry. Odds ratios for near-misses/injuries were strongly significant in the “transport/postal services” industry for those who worked more than 51 hours per week compared to those who worked 35–40 hours per week. Comprehensive protective measures for workers, including (1) reducing total hours of service/job-related fatigue, (2) maintaining sufficient sleep hours/good sleep, and (3) increasing awareness about the impact of overwork/long working hours and sleep-related problems on workers’ safety among employers, workers, clients/customers, and the general public might be effective for preventing near-misses and injuries in industrial settings among workers, especially those who work long hours in the “transport/postal services” industry."
https://openalex.org/W2982007511,"Relative to the large investments in mobile health (mHealth) strategies for mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression, the development of technology to facilitate illness self-management for people with schizophrenia spectrum illnesses is limited. This situation falls out of step with the opportunity mHealth represents for providing inexpensive and accessible self-care resources and the routine use of mobile technologies by people with schizophrenia. Accordingly, the focus of this study was upon the feasibility of a schizophrenia-focused mobile application: App4Independence (A4i). A4i is a multi-feature app that uses feed, scheduling, and text-based functions co-designed with service users to enhance illness self-management. This study was completed in a large urban Canadian centre and employed pre-post assessments over a 1-month period that examined medication adherence, personal recovery, and psychiatric symptomatology. App use metrics were assessed as was qualitative feedback through semi-structured interview. Findings are reported in line with the World Health Organization mHealth Evidence and Assessment (mERA) checklist. Among the 38 individuals with a primary psychosis who participated, there was no research attrition and classic retention on the app was 52.5%. Significant improvement was observed in some psychiatric symptom domains with small-medium effects. Significant change in recovery engagement and medication adherence were not observed after controlling for multiple comparisons. Those who interacted with the app more frequently were more depressed and had higher hostility and interpersonal sensitivity at baseline. Satisfaction with the app was high and qualitative feedback provided insights regarding feature enhancements. This research suggested that A4i is feasible in terms of outcome and process indicators and is a technology that is ready to move on to clinical trial and validation testing. This study contributes to the small but emergent body of work investigating digital health approaches in severe mental illness populations."

Among the four subtypes of JPs (JP1–4), JP2 is predominantly expressed in cardiac myocytes (8Takeshima H. Hoshijima M. Song L.S. Ca2+ microdomains organized by junctophilins.Cell Calcium. 2015; 58 (25659516): 349-35610.1016/j.ceca.2015.01.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).

However, in contrast to striated muscles, SM cells (SMCs) lack the T-tubular system, and, thus, the role of JP2 currently remains unknown. We previously suggested that caveolae, Ω-shaped structures on PM, serve as a structural component responsible for functions of Ca2+ microdomains, and may play significant roles in the control of Ca2+ signaling, excitability, and contractility by facilitating the functional coupling of ion channel complexes in vascular SMCs (VSMCs) (11Hotta S.

For example, localized and spontaneous Ca2+ release from RyR, referred to as Ca2+ sparks, activates large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BKCa) channels in caveolae. As a result, spontaneous transient outward currents (STOCs) are generated to induce membrane hyperpolarization (13Nelson M.T. Cheng H. Rubart M. Santana L.F. Bonev A.D. Knot H.J. Lederer W.J.

Caveolae are implicated in structurally confining action potential Ca2+ signals and may enable efficient, bidirectional Ca2+-mediated cross-talk between the cell surface and SR (11Hotta S.

Caveolin isoforms (Cav1, 2, and 3) are differentially expressed in tissue-dependent manners and are essential for the stability and function of caveolae (17Cohen A.W. Hnasko R. Schubert W.

Cav3, which is the isoform that is predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac myocytes, forms caveolae in the extra T-tubular PM. In contrast, Cav1 may be the key molecule for composing caveolae in SMCs based on observations that a genetic deficiency in Cav1 results in the abolishment of caveolae (18Cheng X. Jaggar J.H.

In SMCs, a JMC-like structure has been detected in specific parts of SR elements located just beneath caveolae by EM analyses (19Popescu L.M. Gherghiceanu M. Mandache E. Cretoiu D.

Based on previous findings (2Takeshima H. Komazaki S. Nishi M. Iino M. Kangawa K. Junctophilins: a novel family of junctional membrane complex proteins.Mol.

Key molecules, such as VDCC, Cav1, BKCa channels, and RyR, may be included in the functional molecular complex in JMCs. Here, fluorescent imaging based on total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and whole-cell patch clamp recordings reveal that JP2 functions as a critical structural component enabling efficient localized translation of Ca2+ sparks to STOCs, thus effectively regulating resting tone in VSMCs. JP2 is abundantly expressed in striated muscles such as cardiac muscles (2Takeshima H. Komazaki S. Nishi M. Iino M. Kangawa K. Junctophilins: a novel family of junctional membrane complex proteins.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6 (10949023): 11-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the expression of JP2 has only been reported at the mRNA level in the SM of the stomach and lung (2Takeshima H. Komazaki S. Nishi M. Iino M. Kangawa K. Junctophilins: a novel family of junctional membrane complex proteins.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6 (10949023): 11-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, our initial experiments were performed to examine the mRNA expression of JP2 in the mouse mesenteric artery. The mRNA expression of JP2 in the mouse mesenteric artery was abundantly detected, in contrast to that of JP1 (Fig. S1A). Western blotting (Fig. 1A) and immunocytochemical staining (Fig. 1B) showed the abundant protein expression of JP2 and its prominent distribution along PM in mouse mesenteric artery SMCs (mMASMCs). Based on our quantitative PCR analyses, the major Cav isoform expressed in mMASMCs was Cav1 (Fig. S1B), as has been reported in airway SM (21Prakash Y.S. Thompson M.A. Vaa B. Matabdin I. Peterson T.E. He T. Pabelick C.M. Caveolins and intracellular calcium regulation in human airway smooth muscle.Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell. Mol. Physiol. 2007; 293 (17704188): L1118-112610.1152/ajplung.00136.2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because a part of the caveola is located very close to SR in SMCs (19Popescu L.M. Gherghiceanu M. Mandache E. Cretoiu D. Caveolae in smooth muscles: nanocontacts.J. Cell Mol. Med. 2006; 10 (17125599): 960-99010.1111/j.1582-4934.2006.tb00539.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we investigated whether JP2 binds to Cav1. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays revealed an interaction between JP2 and Cav1 in rat mesenteric artery SM tissues (Fig. 1C). Moreover, the application of in situ proximity ligation assays (PLAs, see “Experimental procedures”) for JP2 and Cav1 in mMASMCs resulted in the appearance of abundant green fluorescent puncta in epifluorescent images, indicating co-localization of these two molecules within 40 nm (Fig. 1D). The number of puncta in MASMCs from WT mice was significantly larger than in Cav1−/− (WT: 14.8 ± 10.3 puncta/cell, n = 14, Cav1−/−: 1.5 ± 1.4 puncta/cell, n = 10, p < 0.01, Fig. 1E). These results suggest that JP2 and Cav1 closely interact each other in native myocytes. Single molecular imaging using a TIRF microscope was performed to visualize the precise distribution of JP2 and Cav1. These two proteins in freshly isolated mMASMCs were each stained with a specific antibody in SMCs. TIRF images visualized fluorescent particles existing on PM (Fig. 1F). Some of the fluorescent particles of JP2 co-localized with those of Cav1 in mMASMCs (yellow particles indicated by arrowheads in Fig. 1F). To investigate this interaction in more detail, the effects of 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), which removes cholesterol from PM and disrupts caveolae, were examined (Fig. 1G). The ratio of co-localizing particles was significantly reduced by the MβCD treatment (the ratio of co-localization against all JP2 particles: control, 36.2 ± 8.1%, n = 12; MβCD, 22.6 ± 9.3%, n = 10, p < 0.01; the ratio of co-localization against all Cav1 particles, control, 42.1 ± 7.4%, n = 10; MβCD, 27.0 ± 11.1%, n = 12, p < 0.01; Fig. 1, H and I). The specific region of JP2 responsible for the interaction with Cav1 was examined by bimolecular fluorescent complementation (BiFC) analyses (22Suzuki Y. Ohya S. Yamamura H. Giles W.R. Imaizumi Y. A new splice variant of large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (BK) channel α subunit alters human chondrocyte function.J. Biol.

VN and VC are the N- and C-terminal halves, respectively, of the Venus fluorescent protein. The N terminus of full-length JP2 (VN-JP2) or the C termini of a series of truncated JP2 constructs (JP2(X-Y)-VN) were labeled with VN (Fig. 2A, upper). The N terminus of Cav1 (VC-Cav1) was labeled with VC. These constructs were co-expressed in HEK293 cells and visualized by confocal microscopy. The consistent detection of fluorescent signals from the reconstituted Venus protein by VN-VC coupling strongly suggested a molecular interaction between JP2 or truncated JP2 and Cav1. The deletion of 271–290 residues within the joining region (compare [4] and [5] in Fig. 2A) removed molecular coupling between JP2 and Cav1, as shown in Fig. 2B. Further molecular analyses using deletion mutants (mutants [4-i], [4-ii], [4-iii], [5] in Fig. 2, A, lower, and C) revealed that 286TTTET290 was important for JP2-Cav1 binding (n = 7, mutant [5] versus [4-i], p < 0.01; mutant [5] versus [4-ii], [4-iii] p < 0.05; Fig. 2D). Collectively, these results strongly suggest that JP2 (286TTTET290) interacts with Cav1 in caveolae in mMASMCs. The next series of experiments focused on the relationship between JP2 and RyR (Fig. 3), which has been reported in striated muscles (23Jiang M. Zhang M. Howren M. Wang Y. Tan A. Balijepalli R.C. Huizar J.F. Tseng G.N. JPH-2 interacts with Cai-handling proteins and ion channels in dyads: contribution to premature ventricular contraction-induced cardiomyopathy.Heart Rhythm. 2016; 13: 743-75210.1016/j.hrthm.2015.10.037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In freshly isolated mMASMCs, the fluorescent particles of RyR were abundantly detected in TIRF images, indicating very close localization to PM (in the evanescent wave area within 200 nm of the bottom of the chamber; Fig. 3, A and B) (24Yamamura H. Imaizumi Y. Total internal reflection fluorescence imaging of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release in mouse urinary bladder smooth muscle cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2012; 427 (22975345): 54-5910.1016/j.bbrc.2012.08.145Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The application of MβCD had no effect on this co-localization (Fig. 3, B–D) and the number of fluorescent particles of RyR and JP2 (Table S1), suggesting that JP2 binds to RyR in a caveolar-independent manner. The possibility of the co-localization of Cav1 with RyR was also examined in mMASMCs (Fig. 3, E and F). The ratio of co-localizing particles was significantly lower in MβCD-pretreated myocytes than in the control (for Cav1, control, 46.2 ± 5.4%, n = 8; MβCD, 31.6 ± 6.5%, n = 6, p < 0.01; for RyR, control, 50.5 ± 13.3%; MβCD, 34.1 ± 9.9%, p < 0.05; Fig. 3, G and H). These results suggest that the JP2-mediated co-localization of Cav1 and RyR depends on the integrity of the caveolar structure. To gain functional insights into this coupling, Ca2+ dynamics and the location of JP2 or Cav1 were simultaneously recorded in a mMASMC using TIRF microscopy. To prevent the excessive expression of mCherry-tagged JP2 or Cav1 in mMASMCs, the amount of cDNA for transfection was carefully adjusted as reported previously (25Yamamura H. Ikeda C. Suzuki Y. Ohya S. Imaizumi Y. Molecular assembly and dynamics of fluorescent protein-tagged single KCa1.1 channel in expression system and vascular smooth muscle cells.Am. J. Physiol.

Our goal was to reveal the spatiotemporal relationship between Ca2+-spark sites and JMCs or caveolae. The Ca2+ sparks were blocked by 100 μm tetracaine, a RyR inhibitor, but not by 3 μm xestospongin C, an IP3 receptor inhibitor (n = 3 for each, not shown in figures). JP2 or Cav1 labeled with mCherry was transiently expressed in primary-cultured mMASMCs, and Ca2+ sparks were recorded by fluo-4 imaging (Fig. 4A and Movie S1). Based on the kinetic analysis, the Ca2+ signals are identified as Ca2+ sparks (time to peak: 62.0 ± 18.1 ms in mCherry-JP2 expressed cells, 51.8 ± 14.3 ms mCherry-Cav1-expressing cells; full width at half-maximum (FWHM): 2.4 ± 0.9 μm in mCherry-JP2-expressing cells, 2.3 ± 0.8 μm in mCherry-Cav1–expressing cells). These parameters were very similar to previous findings (time to peak: 20–95 ms (26Jaggar J.H. Porter V.A. Lederer W.J. Nelson M.T. Calcium sparks in smooth muscle.Am. J. Physiol.

Two-dimensional distances from spark-generating sites detected as the Ca2+ spark-initiating point in each movie to the fluorescent peak of the closest mCherry-JP2 particles were measured and summarized in Fig. 4B. We noted that the mean radius of mCherry-JP2 particles was 455 nm (r2 = 0.92, Lorenz fit, Fig. 4C). A total of 60.2% of Ca2+ sparks (65/108 sparks from 12 cells) overlapped with mCherry-JP2 particles. Moreover, 61.1% of Ca2+ spark-generating sites (22/36 spark-generating sites from 12 cells) were located within 460 nm of the peak (usually the center) points of mCherry-JP2 signals. Similarly, 47.3% of Ca2+ sparks (69/146 sparks from 15 cells, Fig. 4E) overlapped with the fluorescent particles of mCherry-Cav1 in mMASMCs expressing mCherry-Cav1 (Fig. 4D and Movie S2). The mean radius of mCherry-Cav1 was 368 nm (Fig. 4F). Based on analyses of spark-generating sites, 35.8% of the sites (24/67 from 15 cells) were located within 370 nm of the peak point (typically the center) of mCherry-Cav1 signals. The density of Ca2+ spark-generating sites (sites/μm2) in the JP2 signals (JP2in) and outside of them (JP2out) was 0.276 ± 0.257 and 0.007 ± 0.007, respectively (p < 0.01). The density in the Cav1 signals (Cav1in) and the outside (Cav1out) was 0.517 ± 0.454 and 0.019 ± 0.010, respectively (p < 0.01) (Table S2). These results indicate that a large proportion of Ca2+ spark-generating sites, which may include RyR clusters on SR, closely localized with caveolae (<368 nm) and JP2 signals (<455 nm) in JMC. BKCa channels are preferentially localized in caveolae by the interaction with Cav1 (12Suzuki Y. Yamamura H. Ohya S. Imaizumi Y.

Our assumption is that JP2 is the key molecule functionally linking BKCa channels with RyR in the Ca2+ microdomain. Thus, to examine the exact relationship between JP2 and the BKCa channel, we performed co-IP assays, which clearly demonstrated a molecular interaction between JP2 and BKCa channels in the rat mesenteric artery (Fig. S2A) and in HEK293 cells expressing GFP-JP2 and BKCa channels (Fig. S2B). Our BiFC analyses based on VN-tagged JP2 and the VC-tagged α subunit of BKCa channels (BKα) revealed reconstructed Venus fluorescence along the PM in HEK293 cells, in which VN-JP2 and BKα-VC were both expressed (Fig. S2C). The results using truncated mutants of VN-JP2 revealed a novel molecular interaction of JP2 joining region with BKα-VC, as well as Cav1-VC in Fig. 1, in living cells (Fig. S2, D and E). We then investigated whether Cav1/caveola contributed to the molecular complex formation of the BKCa channel with JP2. Immunostaining analyses with TIRF microscopy showed that BKCa channels are colocalized with JP2 in freshly isolated mMASMCs (Fig. 5A). We then investigated whether Cav1/caveolae contributed to the molecular complex formation of BKCa channels with JP2 using Cav1 knockout mice (Cav1−/−). The co-localization of JP2 and BKα was also detected in Cav1−/− myocytes (Fig. 5B). The ratio of their co-localization versus all BKα particles was significantly decreased by the Cav1 deficiency (WT, 29.4 ± 3.2%, n = 8; Cav1−/−, 16.7 ± 1.5%, n = 11, p < 0.01 versus WT), although the number of fluorescent particles of JP2 and BKα were not altered (Table S1). The ratio of co-localizing particles versus all JP2 particles was also decreased by the Cav1 deficiency (WT, 23.9 ± 9.6%, n = 8; Cav1−/−, 12.0 ± 3.3%, n = 11, p < 0.01 versus control; Fig. 5, C and D). Similar results were obtained when caveolae were disrupted by the MβCD pretreatment (Fig. S3). The average fluorescent intensity per single BKα particle in Cav1−/− (97.2 ± 36.1, n = 11) was significantly lower than that in WT (189.0 ± 77.6, n = 8, p < 0.01) (Fig. 5E). The percentage of the integrated area occupied by BKα particles versus the total TIRF image area was also calculated and compared between WT and Cav1−/− (Fig. 5F). The percentage of BKα in WT (3.2 ± 1.7%, n = 8) was significantly smaller than that in Cav1−/− (5.2 ± 1.5%, n = 11, p < 0.01). In contrast, the number of BKα particles per unit area (100 μm2) of TIRF images and the integrated intensity of BKα particles per unit area were not significantly different between WT and Cav1−/− (number of particles: 10.7 ± 5.3 in WT, n = 8, and 12.6 ± 3.0 in Cav1−/−, n = 11, p > 0.05; intensity: 19.6 ± 13.1 in WT, n = 8, and 12.9 ± 7.6 in Cav1−/−, n = 11, p > 0.05; Fig. 5, G and H"
https://openalex.org/W2960741306,"Osteoporosis is a common skeletal disease, affecting millions of individuals worldwide. Currently used osteoporosis treatments substantially reduce vertebral fracture risk, whereas nonvertebral fracture risk, mainly caused by reduced cortical bone mass, has only moderately been improved by the osteoporosis drugs used, defining an unmet medical need. Because several wingless-type MMTV integration site family members (WNTs) and modulators of WNT activity are major regulators of bone mass, we hypothesized that NOTUM, a secreted WNT lipase, might modulate bone mass via an inhibition of WNT activity. To characterize the possible role of endogenous NOTUM as a physiologic modulator of bone mass, we developed global, cell-specific, and inducible Notum-inactivated mouse models. Notum expression was high in the cortical bone in mice, and conditional Notum inactivation revealed that osteoblast lineage cells are the principal source of NOTUM in the cortical bone. Osteoblast lineage–specific Notum inactivation increased cortical bone thickness via an increased periosteal circumference. Inducible Notum inactivation in adult mice increased cortical bone thickness as a result of increased periosteal bone formation, and silencing of Notum expression in cultured osteoblasts enhanced osteoblast differentiation. Large-scale human genetic analyses identified genetic variants mapping to the NOTUM locus that are strongly associated with bone mineral density (BMD) as estimated with quantitative ultrasound in the heel. Thus, osteoblast-derived NOTUM is an essential local physiologic regulator of cortical bone mass via effects on periosteal bone formation in adult mice, and genetic variants in the NOTUM locus are associated with BMD variation in adult humans. Therapies targeting osteoblast-derived NOTUM may prevent nonvertebral fractures.—Movérare-Skrtic, S., Nilsson, K.

https://openalex.org/W2957455476,"Ovarian cancer is the fifth-leading cause of cancer death among women. The dissemination of ovarian tumors and growth as spheroids accompanies late-stage disease. In cell culture, ovarian tumor cell spheroids can exhibit elevated resistance to environmental stressors, such as reactive oxygen species. Homeostatic balance of the antioxidant response is a protective mechanism that prevents anoikis, a form of programmed cell death. Signaling pathways activated by integrin receptors suppress anoikis. Rgnef (ARHGEF28/p190RhoGEF) is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that is activated downstream of integrins. We find that Rgnef protein levels are elevated in late-stage serous ovarian cancer, high Rgnef mRNA levels are associated with decreased progression-free and overall survival, and genomic ARHGEF28 loss is associated with increased patient survival. Using transgenic and transplantable Rgnef knockout mouse models, we find that Rgnef is essential for supporting three-dimensional ovarian spheroid formation in vitro and tumor growth in mice. Using RNA-sequencing and bioinformatic analyses, we identify a conserved Rgnef-supported anti-oxidant gene signature including Gpx4, Nqo1, and Gsta4; common targets of the NF-kB transcription factor. Antioxidant treatment enhanced growth of Rgnef-knockout spheroids and Rgnef re-expression facilitated NF-κB-dependent tumorsphere survival. These studies reveal a new role for Rgnef in ovarian cancer to facilitate NF-κB-mediated gene expression protecting cells from oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2959907641,"Quantitative camera surveys of benthic megafauna were carried out during the expedition ARK-XXVII/3 to the Eastern Central Arctic Basins with the research icebreaker Polarstern in summer 2012 (2 August-29 September). Nine transects were performed for the first time in deep-sea areas previously fully covered by ice, four of them in the Nansen Basin (3571-4066m) and five in the Amundsen Basin (4041-4384m). At seven of these stations benthic Agassiz trawls were taken near the camera tracks for species identification. Observed Arctic deep-sea megafauna was largely endemic. Several taxa showed a substantially greater depth or geographical range than previously assumed. Variations in the composition and structure of megabenthic communities were analysed and linked to several environmental variables, including state of the sea ice and phytodetritus supply to the seafloor. Three different types of communities were identified based on species dominating the biomass. Among these species were the actiniarian Bathyphellia margaritacea and the holothurians Elpidia heckeri and Kolga hyalina. Variations in megafaunal abundance were first of all related to the proximity to the marginal ice zone. Stations located closer to this zone were characterized by relatively high densities and biomass of B. margaritacea. Food supply was higher at these stations, as suggested by enhanced concentrations of pigments, organic carbon, bacterial cell abundances and nutrients in the sediments. Fully ice-covered stations closer to the North Pole and partially under multi-year ice were characterized by lower concentrations of the same biogeochemical indicators for food supply. These stations nevertheless hosted relatively high density and biomass of the holothurians E. heckeri or K. hyalina, which were observed to feed on large food falls of the sea-ice colonial diatom Melosira arctica. The link between the community structure of megafauna and the extent and condition of the Central Arctic sea-ice cover suggests that future climate changes may substantially affect deep ocean biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W2959609543,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) arises through accumulation of multiple genetic alterations. However, cancer cells also acquire and depend on cancer-specific epigenetic changes. To conclusively demonstrate the crucial relevance of the epigenetic programme for the tumourigenicity of the cancer cells, we used cellular reprogramming technology to reverse these epigenetic changes. We reprogrammed human PDAC cultures using three different techniques - (1) lentivirally via induction of Yamanaka Factors (OSKM), (2) the pluripotency-associated gene OCT4 and the microRNA mir-302, or (3) using episomal vectors as a safer alternative without genomic integration. We found that induction with episomal vectors was the most efficient method to reprogram primary human PDAC cultures as well as primary human fibroblasts that served as positive controls. Successful reprogramming was evidenced by immunostaining, alkaline phosphatase staining, and real-time PCR. Intriguingly, reprogramming of primary human PDAC cultures drastically reduced their in vivo tumourigenicity, which appeared to be driven by the cells' enhanced differentiation and loss of stemness upon transplantation. Our study demonstrates that reprogrammed primary PDAC cultures are functionally distinct from parental PDAC cells resulting in drastically reduced tumourigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Thus, epigenetic alterations account at least in part for the tumourigenicity and aggressiveness of pancreatic cancer, supporting the notion that epigenetic modulators could be a suitable approach to improve the dismal outcome of patients with pancreatic cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2958364585,"Fruits are nowadays considered important suppliers of anti-oxidant molecules. Apples are particularly rich in phenolic compounds, non-nutritional phytochemicals that play active roles in controlling severe chronic diseases. In this work, 19 phenolic compounds were investigated in both skin and pulp tissues of seven apple accessions across the Malus genus collected at two stages: during fruit development and at harvest. The primary difference in phenolic concentration between wild and domesticated accessions, especially in the pulp, could be explained by the larger growth rate of the domesticated varieties. The proposed dilution effect was also confirmed through the observation of the increased content of procyanidin B2+B4 and phloridzin in russet-skinned apples, known to have higher concentrations of these compounds. The metabolite screening was also accompanied by the expression analysis of 16 polyphenolic genes showing, for nine elements, a higher expression at harvest than during fruit development. Finally, a polyphenolic comparison with red-fleshed apples was also carried out, underlying a larger amount of procyanidins and quercetin-3rhamnoside in the white-fleshed accessions. The results presented and discussed in this work suggest that specific white-fleshed apples, especially with russeted-skin, may play an important role in ameliorating the nutraceutical potential of apple fruit."
https://openalex.org/W2960393442,"About 80% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) have chromosomal instability, which is an integral part of aggressive malignancy development, but the importance of specific copy number aberrations (CNAs) in modulating gene expression, particularly within the framework of clinically relevant molecular subtypes, remains mostly elusive. We performed DNA copy number profiling of 257 stage I-IV primary CRCs and integrative gene expression analysis in 151 microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors, focusing on high-level amplifications and the effect of CNAs on the characteristics of the gene expression-based consensus molecular subtypes (CMS). The results were validated in 323 MSS tumors from TCGA. Novel recurrent high-level amplifications (≥15 additional copies) with a major impact on gene expression were found for TOX3 (16q) at 1.5% frequency, as well as for CCND2 (12p) and ANXA11 (10q) at 1% frequency, in addition to the well-known targets ERBB2 (17q) and MYC (8q). Focal amplifications with ≥15 or ≥5 additional copies of at least one of these regions were associated with a poor overall survival among patients with stage I-III MSS CRCs (multivariable hazard ratio ≥3.2, p ≤ 0.01). All high-level amplifications were focal and had a more consistent relationship with gene expression than lower amplitude and/or broad-range amplifications, suggesting specific targeting during carcinogenesis. Genome-wide, copy number driven gene expression was enriched for pathways characteristic of the CMS2-epithelial/canonical subtype, including DNA repair and cell cycle progression. Furthermore, 50% of upregulated genes in CMS2-epithelial/canonical MSS CRCs were driven by CNAs, an enrichment compared with the other CMS groups, and associated with the stronger correspondence between CNAs and gene expression in malignant epithelial cells than in the cells of the tumor microenvironment (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, leukocytes). In conclusion, we identify novel recurrent amplifications with impact on gene expression in CRC and provide the first evidence that CMS2 may have a stronger copy-number related genetic basis than subtypes more heavily influenced by gene expression signals from the tumor microenvironment."
https://openalex.org/W2956298175,"Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by pathological hallmarks of neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques. The plaques are formed by aggregation and accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ), a cleavage fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Enhanced neuronal activity and seizure events are frequently observed in AD, and elevated synaptic activity promotes Aβ production. However, the mechanisms that link synaptic hyperactivity to APP processing and AD pathogenesis are not well understood. We previously found that Polo-like kinase 2 (Plk2), a homeostatic repressor of neuronal overexcitation, promotes APP β-processing in vitro. Here, we report that Plk2 stimulates Aβ production in vivo, and that Plk2 levels are elevated in a spatiotemporally regulated manner in brains of AD mouse models and human AD patients. Genetic disruption of Plk2 kinase function reduces plaque deposits and activity-dependent Aβ production. Furthermore, pharmacological Plk2 inhibition hinders Aβ formation, synapse loss, and memory decline in an AD mouse model. Thus, Plk2 links synaptic overactivity to APP β-processing, Aβ production, and disease-relevant phenotypes in vivo, suggesting that Plk2 may be a potential target for AD therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2957239260,"Glycosylation is a common modification reaction in natural product biosynthesis and has been known to be a post-assembly line tailoring process in glycosylated polyketide biosynthesis. Here, we show that in pactamycin biosynthesis, glycosylation can take place on an acyl carrier protein (ACP)-bound polyketide intermediate. Using in vivo gene inactivation, chemical complementation and in vitro pathway reconstitution, we demonstrate that the 3-aminoacetophenone moiety of pactamycin is derived from 3-aminobenzoic acid by a set of discrete polyketide synthase proteins via a 3-(3-aminophenyl)3-oxopropionyl-ACP intermediate. This ACP-bound intermediate is then glycosylated by an N-glycosyltransferase, PtmJ, providing a sugar precursor for the formation of the aminocyclopentitol core structure of pactamycin. This is the first example of glycosylation of a small molecule while tethered to a carrier protein. Additionally, we demonstrate that PtmO is a hydrolase that is responsible for the release of the ACP-bound product to a free β-ketoacid that subsequently undergoes decarboxylation. Characterization of multiple enzymes involves in biosynthesis of the aminocyclitol antibiotic pactamycin reveals a key step involving the glycosylation of an acyl carrier protein-bound intermediate by the promiscuous glycosyltransferase PtmJ."
https://openalex.org/W2957701522,"Image segmentation applied to medical image analysis is still a critical and important task. Although there exist several segmentation algorithms that have been widely studied in literature, these are subject to segmentation problems such as over- and under-segmentation as well as non-closed edges. In this paper, a simple method that combines well-known segmentation algorithms is presented. This method is applied to detect acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in bacilloscopies used to diagnose pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). This diagnosis can be performed through different tests, and the most used worldwide is smear microscopy because of its low cost and effectiveness. This diagnosis technique is based on the analysis and counting of the bacilli in the bacilloscopy observed under an optical microscope. The proposed method is used to segment the bacilli in digital images from bacilloscopies processed using Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining. The proposed method is fast, has a low computational cost and good efficiency compared to other methods. The bacilli image segmentation is performed by image processing and analysis techniques, probability concepts and classifiers. In this work, a Bayesian classifier based on a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used. The segmentations' results are validated by using the Jaccard index, which indicates the efficiency of the classifier."
https://openalex.org/W2959786778,"Oceanic islands have been providing important insights on the structuring of ecological communities and, under the context of the present biodiversity crisis, they are paramount to assess the effects of biological invasions on community assembly. In this study we compare the taxonomic and functional diversity of insect herbivore assemblages associated with the dominant tree species of Azorean native forests and investigate the ecological processes that may have originated current patterns of plant-herbivore associations. Five dominant trees-Erica azorica, Ilex perado subsp. azorica, Juniperus brevifolia, Laurus azorica and Vaccinium cylindraceum-were sampled in the remnants of the native forest of Terceira Island (Azores) using a standardised methodology. The taxonomic and functional diversity of insect herbivore assemblages was assessed using complementary metrics and beta diversity partitioning analysis (species replacement and richness differences) aiming to evaluate the variation in insect herbivore assemblages within and between the study plant species. Sixty two insect species, mostly bugs (Hemiptera) and caterpillars (Lepidoptera), were found in the five study plants with indigenous (endemic and native non-endemic) insects occurring with higher species richness and abundance than introduced ones. Species replacement was the most important component of insect herbivore taxonomic beta diversity while differences in trait richness played a major role on functional beta diversity. The endemic E. azorica stands out from the other study plants by having associated a very distinct insect herbivore assemblage with a particular set of functional attributes, mainly composed by large bodied and long shaped species that feed by chewing. Despite the progressive biotic homogenization witnessed in the Azores during the last few decades, several strong associations between the endemic trees and their indigenous insect herbivores remain."
https://openalex.org/W2958722933,"Children aged 2 to 6 years are in a crucial period of growth development, during which it is important for them to attain specific cognition related to concentration and attention so that they can perform well in school later in life. Various factors influence children’s cognition during this crucial period. However, to date, only a limited number of studies have examined the cognitive performance of underprivileged children living in poverty, particularly indigenous children (also known as Orang Asli children in Malaysia). Therefore, this cross-sectional study aimed to determine the associations between sociodemographic factors, nutritional factors (body composition and hemoglobin), and environmental factors (home environment and parasitic infections) with cognitive performance among Orang Asli children in Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. The participants were 269 children (51% boys, 49% girls) aged 2 to 6 years (M = 4.0, SD = 1.2 years) and their mothers, from 14 Orang Asli villages. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with the mothers, and the children’s cognitive performance, operationalized as working memory index (WMI), processing speed index (PSI), and cognitive proficiency index (CPI), was assessed using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, Fourth Edition (WPPSI-IV). The children’s weight and height were measured, and their blood and stool samples were collected to assess hemoglobin level and parasitic infections, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the father’s years of education (β = 0.262–0.342, p < 0.05), availability of learning materials at home (β = 0.263–0.425, p < 0.05), and responsiveness of the parent to the child (β = 0.192–0.331, p < 0.05) were consistently associated with all three cognitive indices (WMI, PSI, and CPI). A holistic approach involving parents, communities, and government agencies should be established to improve the cognitive performance of these underprivileged children."
https://openalex.org/W2961793448,"The exclusion of female rodents from biomedical research is well documented and persists in large part due to perceptions that ovulatory cycles render female traits more variable than those of males, and females must be tested at each of four stages of the estrous cycle to generate reliable data. These beliefs are not empirically based. The magnitude of trait variance associated with the estrous cycle may be sufficiently low and of little impact, or trait variability of males tested on 4 consecutive days may be as great as that of females over the 4 days of the estrous cycle. Here, we analyzed food intake data from mice in 4-day blocks, corresponding to the females' 4-day estrous cycle in several schedules of food procurement or reward. Variance was compared within and across individual mice. In no instance did the overall variance differ by sex under any of the food reward schedules. This extends earlier observations of trait variability in body temperature and locomotor activity of mice and supports the claim that there is no empirical basis for excluding female rodents from biomedical research."
https://openalex.org/W2930838048,"Glycogen is a highly branched α-glucan polymer widely used as energy and carbon reserve by many microorganisms. The branches are introduced by glycogen branching enzymes (EC 2.4.1.18), that are classified into glycoside hydrolase families 13 (GH13) and 57 (GH57). Most microorganisms have typically only a single glycogen branching enzyme (gbe) gene. Only a few microorganisms carry both GH13 and GH57 gbe genes, such as Petrotoga mobilis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Here we report the basic characteristics of the GH13 and GH57 GBE of P. mobilis, both heterologously expressed in E. coli. The GH13 GBE has a considerably higher branching activity towards the linear α-glucan amylose, and produces a highly branched α-glucan with a high molecular weight which is very similar to glycogen. The GH57 GBE, on the contrary, makes a much smaller branched α-glucan. While the GH13 GBE acts as a classical glycogen branching enzyme involved in glycogen synthesis, the role of GH57 GBE remains unclear."

The current study examined the relationships between personality traits and self-reported memory problems in cognitively intact older adults, and whether these associations differ across Black and White older adults. Data were collected annually via in-person comprehensive medical and neuropsychological examinations as part of the Einstein Aging Study. Community-dwelling older adults in an urban, multi-ethnic area of New York City were interviewed. The current study included a total of 425 older adults (Mage = 76.68, SD = 4.72, 62.59% female; 72.00% White). Multilevel modeling tested the associations of neuroticism, conscientiousness, extraversion, openness, and agreeableness with self-reported memory problems. Results showed that neuroticism was positively related to frequency of memory problems and perceived ten-year memory decline only when other personality traits were not accounted for. Extraversion was negatively related to frequency of memory problems and perceived ten-year decline for both White and Black participants. However, conscientiousness was negatively related to perceived ten-year decline for Black participants only. Our findings highlight the importance of examining the association of all five personality traits with self-reported memory problems, as well as examining whether these associations differ for participants from different race/ethnicities."

Improved characterization of Mtb/HIV coinfection as a distinct disease state may lead to better identification and treatment of affected individuals.Four previously-published TB and HIV co-infection related datasets were used to train and validate multinomial machine learning classifiers that simultaneously predict TB and HIV status. Classifier predictive performance was measured using leave-one-out cross validation on the training set and blind predictive performance on multiple test sets using area under the ROC curve (AUC) as the performance metric. Linear modelling of signature gene expression was applied to systematically classify genes as TB-only, HIV-only or combined TB/HIV.The optimal signature discovered was a 10-gene random forest multinomial signature that robustly discriminated active tuberculosis (TB) from other non-TB disease states with improved performance compared with previously published signatures (AUC: 0.87), and specifically discriminated active TB/HIV co-infection from all other conditions (AUC: 0.88). Signature genes exhibited a variety of transcriptional patterns including both TB-only and HIV-only response genes and genes with expression patterns driven by interactions between HIV and TB infection states, including the CD8+ T-cell receptor LAG3 and the apoptosis-related gene CERKL.By explicitly including distinct disease states within the machine learning analysis framework, we developed a compact and highly diagnostic signature that simultaneously discriminates multiple disease states associated with Mtb/HIV co-infection. Examination of the expression patterns of signature genes suggests mechanisms underlying the unique inflammatory conditions associated with active TB in the presence of HIV. In particular, we observed that dysregulation of CD8+ effector T-cell and NK-cell associated genes may be an important feature of Mtb/HIV co-infection."

The role of these polypeptides in promoting the nucleation of hydroxyapatite (HA) has been previously investigated, yet is still not fully understood. Here we study the potential of HA mineralization via FDPs incorporated at 1:10, 1:2 and 1:1 in a plastically compressed (PC) and dense collagen (DC) scaffold. Scaffolds were immersed in simulated body fluid (SBF) at physiological conditions (pH = 7.4, 37°C) to promote biomineralization. The effect of Cs and Cp to promote HA nucleation was investigated at different time points, and compared to pure DC scaffolds. Characterization of Cs and Cp fragments using Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry (LCMS) showed little difference in the amino acid composition of the FDPs. Results obtained in vitro using Attenuated Total Reflectance Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and mass analysis showed little difference between scaffolds that incorporated Cs, Cp, and DC hydrogels. These results demonstrated that silk FDPs incorporation are not yet suitable to promote HA nucleation in vivo without further refining the collagen-FDP system."

Maximal variation sampling was used for both patients and referring primary health professionals to ensure an equal representation of males and females, and patients of different CKD stages. All discussions were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim, before being thematically analysed independently by 2 researchers.The mean age (SD) for specialist health professionals, primary care professionals and patients who participated was 45 (11), 44 (15) and 68 (5) years with men being 50%, 80% and 76% of the participants respectively. Key strengths of the diabetes and kidney service were noted to be better integration of care and a perception of improved health and management of health. Whilst some aspects of access such as time between referral and initial appointment and having fewer appointments improved, other aspects such as in-clinic waiting times and parking remained problematic. Specialist health professionals noted that health professional education could be improved. Patient self-management was also noted by to be an issue with some patients requesting more information and some health professionals expressing difficulty in empowering some patients.Health professionals and patients reported that a co-designed integrated diabetes kidney service improved integration of care and improved health and management of health. However, some aspects of the process of care, health professional education and patient self-management remained challenging."

From the perspective of computation, the formal model of neighborhood representation is a challenging question. This study presents a formal spatial data model for representing the planar spatial field with the support of Delaunay triangulation. Based on the three geometric elements in a triangle of the vertex, edge, and triangle area, the constructed data model describes the spatial objects of a point, line, and region respectively, as well as the neighborhood relationships among them. Three types of operators based on the model are formally defined, expanding, compressing and skeletonizing. For practical applications, three complex operators are extended by continuous and conditional operation. Through the application example of urban building generalization, this study illustrates the analysis of a neighborhood relationship and the detection of spatial conflicts, which is a crucial pre-process during map generalization. With the support of the proposed formal model of neighborhood representation, the generalization method uses the three basic operations of grouping, displacement and aggregation to perform decision making and detailed operation. The generalized result can retain the balance of built-up area better than that of other similar building generalization methods."
https://openalex.org/W2959339086,"Background Influenza is an important contributor to acute respiratory illness, including pneumonia, and results in substantial morbidity and mortality globally. Understanding the local burden of influenza-associated severe disease can inform decisions on allocation of resources toward influenza control programs. Currently, there is no national influenza vaccination program in Uganda. Methods In this study, we used data on pneumonia hospitalizations that were collected and reported through the Health Management Information System (HMIS) of the Ministry of Health, Uganda, and the laboratory-confirmed influenza positivity data from severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) surveillance in three districts (Wakiso, Mbarara, and Tororo) to estimate the age-specific incidence of influenza-associated pneumonia hospitalizations from January 2013 through December 2016. Results The overall estimated mean annual rate of pneumonia hospitalizations in the three districts was 371 (95% confidence interval [CI] 323–434) per 100,000 persons, and was highest among children aged <5 years (1,524 [95% CI 1,286–1,849]) compared to persons aged ≥5 years (123 [95% CI 105–144]) per 100,000 persons. The estimated mean annual rate of influenza-associated pneumonia hospitalization was 34 (95% CI 23–48) per 100,000 persons (116 [95% CI 78–165] and 16 [95% CI 6–28] per 100,000 persons among children aged <5 years and those ≥5 years, respectively). Among children aged <5 years, the rate of hospitalized influenza-associated pneumonia was highest among those who were <2 years old (178 [95% CI 109–265] per 100,000 persons). Over the period of analysis, the estimated mean annual number of hospitalized influenza-associated pneumonia cases in the three districts ranged between 672 and 1,436, of which over 70% represent children aged <5 years. Conclusions The burden of influenza-associated pneumonia hospitalizations was substantial in Uganda, and was highest among young children aged <5 years. Influenza vaccination may be considered, especially for very young children."
https://openalex.org/W2962010928,"The pathogenesis of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is incompletely understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important mediators that normally function via post-transcriptional degradation of target mRNAs. Emerging evidence indicates the appearance of differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs in CI-AKI following the injection of intravenous contrast medium. However, there are differences in the pathological mechanism and incidence of CI-AKI between intravenous and intra-arterial contrast administration. The present study aimed to investigate the critical roles of dysregulated miRNAs and their associated mRNAs in kidney injury following intra-arterial contrast medium exposure. Based on a reliable CI-AKI rat model, we conducted genome-wide miRNA and mRNA expression profiling analysis using deep sequencing. In the study, 36 DE mature miRNAs were identified (fold change > 1.5 and p value < 0.05) in the kidneys of CI-AKI rats (n = 3) compared with that in the controls (n = 3), consisting of 23 up-regulated and 13 down-regulated DE miRNAs. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that wingnut (Wnt), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), and 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways were most likely to be modulated by these dysregulated miRNAs. Around 453 dysregulated genes (fold change > 2.0 and p value < 0.05) were identified. Integrated analysis revealed 2037 putative miRNA-mRNA pairs with negative correlations. Among them, 6 DE miRNAs and 13 genes were selected for further quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction validation (n = 6 for each group), and a good correspondence between the two techniques was observed. In conclusion, the present study provided evidence of miRNA-mRNA interactions in the development of kidney injury following an intra-arterial contrast injection. These findings provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of CI-AKI."

During the progression of the disease, several cognitive mechanisms deteriorate thus diminishing the patient’s quality of life. A primary objective in the cognitive assessment of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients is to find reliable measures utilizing diverse neuroimaging techniques. Moreover, especially relevant in the clinical environment is finding technical approaches that could be applied to individual participants and not only for group analysis. A 64-channel electroencephalographic recording (EEG) was made with thirty participants divided into three groups of equivalent size (N = 10) (healthy control, low-EDSS (1–2.5) and moderate-EDSS (4–6)). Correlation analysis was applied to multiple measures: behavior, neuropsychological tests (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, 3 seconds (PASAT-3s) and the Symbol Digit Modality Test (SDMT)), Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), even-related potential (P3) and event-related desynchronization (ERD) parameters and the correlation scores between individual participant’s P3/ERD maps and the healthy grand average P3/ERDmaps. Statistical analysis showed that diverse parameters exhibited significant correlations. A remarkable correlation was the moderate score found between SDMT and EDSS (r = −0.679, p = 0.0009). However, the strongest correlation was between the value of integrated measures (reaction time, P3 and ERD latency) and EDSS (r = 0.699, p = 0.0006). In regard to correlations for grand average maps between groups, the P3 component exhibited a lower score according to a more deteriorated condition (higher EDSS). In contrast, ERD maps remained stable with an increase of EDSS. Lastly, a Z-transformation of individual values of all variables included in the study exhibited heterogeneity in cognitive alterations in the multiple sclerosis participants."
https://openalex.org/W2959312859,"In humans, the most common epigenetic DNA modification is methylation of the 5-carbon of cytosines, predominantly in CpG dinucleotides. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark associated with gene repression. Disruption of the normal DNA methylation pattern is known to play a role in the initiation and progression of many cancers. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), the most abundant DNA methyltransferase in humans, is primarily responsible for maintenance of the DNA methylation pattern and is considered an important cancer drug target. Recently, laccaic acid A (LCA), a highly substituted anthraquinone natural product, was identified as a direct, DNA-competitive inhibitor of DNMT1. Here, we have successfully screened a small library of simplified anthraquinone compounds for DNMT1 inhibition. Using an endonuclease-coupled DNA methylation assay, we identified two anthraquinone compounds, each containing an aromatic substituent, that act as direct DNMT1 inhibitors. These simplified anthraquinone compounds retain the DNA-competitive mechanism of action of LCA and exhibit some selectivity for DNMT1 over DNMT3a. The newly identified compounds are at least 40-fold less potent than LCA, but have significantly less complex structures. Collectively, this data indicates that substituted anthraquinone compounds could serve as a novel scaffold for developing DNMT1-specific inhibitors."

Phlebotomines were captured in anthropized and wild environments in the outskirts of Oiapoque municipality, using CDC light traps installed in vertical (ground/canopy level) and horizontal (peridomicile/extradomicile/forest-edge/forest) strata. Captured specimens were identified according to their morphology. Females were processed for Leishmania DNA detection and characterization using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction targeting kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) and the phlebotomine cacophony gene. The kDNA positive samples were characterized by cloning and sequencing the Leishmania 234 bp-hsp70 gene. Among the 3957 phlebotomine specimens captured, 26 pooled female samples were positive for Leishmania (Viannia) spp. DNA. Sequencing analysis allowed species-specific identification of L. (V.) braziliensis DNA in Trichophoromyia ininii, Bichromomyia flaviscutellata, Nyssomyia umbratilis, and Evandromyia infraspinosa, and L. (V.) guyanensis DNA in Ny. umbratilis. A pooled sample of Ny. umbratilis was positive for both L. (V.) braziliensis and L. (V.) guyanensis DNA. The present study provided additional information regarding ACL ecology in Oiapoque, highlighting the presence of L. (V.) braziliensis DNA in different phlebotomine species. The epidemiological implications of these findings and the determinant incrimination of L. (V.) braziliensis as proven vectors in that region must be clarified. In this regard, studies on Leishmania spp. infection and suggestive anthropophilic behavior of associated phlebotomines need to be prioritized in entomological surveillance."
https://openalex.org/W2960774465,"Leptin is an adipokine that regulates adipose tissue mass through membrane-anchored leptin receptor (Ob-R). Extracellular domain of Ob-R in plasma is called soluble leptin receptor (sOb-R), and is the main leptin-binding protein. Based on a previous DNA microarray analysis that showed induction of hepatic Ob-R mRNA in low-protein diet-fed mice, this study aimed to clarify the effect of dietary protein restriction on hepatic Ob-R mRNA and plasma sOb-R levels. First, the effect of protein restriction on hepatic Ob-R mRNA level was examined together with fasting and food restriction using male rats as common experimental model for nutritional research. Hepatic Ob-R mRNA level was increased by feeding low-protein diet for 7 d, although not significantly influenced by 12-h fasting and sixty percent restriction in food consumption. Then, effect of protein restriction on liver Ob-R and plasma sOb-R was investigated using male mice because specific sOb-R ELISA was more available for mice. Hepatic Ob-R mRNA level was also increased in protein restricted-mice although it did not increase in hypothalamus. Hepatic Ob-R protein was decreased, whereas plasma sOb-R was increased by protein restriction. Because the concentration of sOb-R increased without changing plasma leptin concentration, free leptin in plasma was significantly reduced. The direct effect of amino acid deprivation on Ob-R mRNA level was not observed in rat hepatoma cells H4IIE cultured in amino acid deprived medium. In conclusion, dietary protein restriction increased hepatic Ob-R mRNA, resulting in increased plasma sOb-R concentration, which in turn, reduces plasma free leptin level and may modulate leptin activity."

The mass incarceration of African American men is hypothesized to increase HIV acquisition risk for African American women. Interventions optimizing HIV care engagement and minimizing sexual risk behaviors for men living with HIV post-incarceration may decrease HIV incidence.Using an agent-based model, we simulated a sexual and injection drug using network representing the African American population of Philadelphia. We compared intervention strategies for men living with HIV post-incarceration by the number of averted HIV transmissions to women within the community. Three interventions were evaluated: a 90-90-90 scenario scaling up HIV testing, ART provision, and ART adherence; a behavioral intervention decreasing sexual risk behaviors; and a combination intervention involving both.The status quo scenario projected 2,836 HIV transmissions to women over twenty years. HIV transmissions to women decreased by 29% with the 90-90-90 intervention, 23% with the behavioral intervention, and 37% with both. The number of men living with HIV receiving the intervention needed in order to prevent a single HIV transmission ranged between 6 and 10.Interventions to improve care engagement and decrease sexual risk behaviors post-incarceration for men living with HIV have the potential to decrease HIV incidence within African American heterosexual networks."
https://openalex.org/W2956756773,"Autophagy is a conserved eukaryotic process that mediates lysosomal degradation of cytoplasmic macromolecules and damaged organelles, also exerting an important role in the elimination of intracellular pathogens. Despite the antiviral role of autophagy, many studies suggest that some positive-stranded RNA viruses exploit this pathway to facilitate their own replication. In this study, we demonstrate that the equine torovirus Berne virus (BEV), the prototype member of the Torovirus genus (Coronaviridae Family, Nidovirales Order), induces autophagy at late times post-infection. Conversion of microtubule associated protein 1B light chain 3 (LC3) from cytosolic (LC3 I) to the membrane associated form (LC3 II), a canonical marker of autophagosome formation, is enhanced in BEV infected cells. However, neither autophagy induction, via starvation, nor pharmacological blockade significantly affect BEV replication. Similarly, BEV infection is not altered in autophagy deficient cells lacking either Beclin 1 or LC3B protein expression. Unexpectedly, the cargo receptor p62, a selective autophagy receptor, aggregates within the region where the BEV main protease (Mpro) localizes. This finding, coupled with observation that BEV replication also induces ER stress at the time when selective autophagy is taking place, suggests that the autophagy pathway is activated in response to the hefty accumulation of virus-encoded polypeptides during the late phase of BEV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2957068517,"Reactivation of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) from latency requires the viral transactivator Rta to contact the host protein Jκ recombination signal-binding protein (RBP-Jκ or CSL). RBP-Jκ normally binds DNA sequence-specifically to determine the transcriptional targets of the Notch-signaling pathway, yet Notch alone cannot reactivate KSHV. We previously showed that Rta stimulates RBP-Jκ DNA binding to the viral genome. On a model viral promoter, this function requires Rta to bind to multiple copies of an Rta DNA motif (called “CANT” or Rta-c) proximal to an RBP-Jκ motif. Here, high-resolution ChIP/deep sequencing from infected primary effusion lymphoma cells revealed that RBP-Jκ binds nearly exclusively to different sets of viral genome sites during latency and reactivation. RBP-Jκ bound DNA frequently, but not exclusively, proximal to Rta bound to single, but not multiple, Rta-c motifs. To discover additional regulators of RBP-Jκ DNA binding, we used bioinformatics to identify cellular DNA-binding protein motifs adjacent to either latent or reactivation-specific RBP-Jκ–binding sites. Many of these cellular factors, including POU class homeobox (POU) proteins, have known Notch or herpesvirus phenotypes. Among a set of Rta- and RBP-Jκ–bound promoters, Rta transactivated only those that also contained POU motifs in conserved positions. On some promoters, POU factors appeared to inhibit RBP-Jκ DNA binding unless Rta bound to a proximal Rta-c motif. Moreover, POU2F1/Oct-1 expression was induced during KSHV reactivation, and POU2F1 knockdown diminished infectious virus production. Our results suggest that Rta and POU proteins broadly regulate DNA binding of RBP-Jκ during KSHV reactivation.

On the Mta promoter, stimulation of RBP-Jκ DNA binding by Rta requires four molecular interactions as follows: Rta homotetramerization, Rta binding to RBP-Jκ and to repeats of the Rta-c DNA motif (also called a “CANT” motif), and RBP-Jκ binding to a consensus RBP-Jκ motif (8Carroll K.D.

Rta-c motifs have the consensus sequence ANTGTAACANT(A/T)(A/T)T (the conserved core sequence is underlined), and the motif is repeated seven times near the RBP-Jκ motif in the Mta promoter (Fig. 1). The number of Rta-c motifs is proportional to Rta's promoter–binding affinity, formation of ternary Rta/RBP-Jκ/DNA complexes, and stimulation of RBP-Jκ DNA binding (16Palmeri D. Carroll K.D.

Virol. 2011; 85 (21880753): 11901-1191510.1128/JVI.05479-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although we used a ChIP/Southern blotting approach to confirm broad enhancement of RBP-Jκ binding to the viral genome during KSHV reactivation, our model had shortcomings (16Palmeri D. Carroll K.D. Gonzalez-Lopez O. Lukac D.M. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus Rta tetramers make high-affinity interactions with repetitive DNA elements in the Mta promoter to stimulate DNA binding of RBP-Jκ/CSL.J. Virol. 2011; 85 (21880753): 11901-1191510.1128/JVI.05479-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We based our model on detailed molecular and biochemical studies of only a single KSHV promoter. In addition, our data did not clearly distinguish the relative contribution of the Rta-c DNA motifs from that of a second overlapping DNA repeat, (A/T)3N17(A/T)3, shown to mediate Rta binding to other viral promoters (39Liao W. Tang Y. Kuo Y.L. Liu B.Y. Xu C.J. Giam C.Z. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus/human herpesvirus 8 transcriptional activator Rta is an oligomeric DNA-binding protein that interacts with tandem arrays of phased A/T-trinucleotide motifs.J.

Our ChIP/Southern blotting also had inherently low resolution, which prohibited us from identifying the architectures of other promoters containing RBP-Jκ–binding sites. In this study, we identified and characterized KSHV DNA sequences critical for assembling productive Rta/RBP-Jκ complexes in KSHV-infected PEL (B) cells. We employed ChIP/deep sequencing (ChIP/Seq) to classify hundreds of authentic Rta and RBP-Jκ–binding sites on the KSHV genome during latency and reactivation. We demonstrate that DNA binding of RBP-Jκ is dynamic across the viral genome, and very few RBP-Jκ sites are occupied during both latency and reactivation. Stimulation of RBP-Jκ DNA binding to many, but not all promoters, including the Mta promoter, was associated with Rta DNA binding to Rta-c motifs. However, Mta was the only promoter bound by both proteins that contained an Rta-c multimer. To identify additional DNA elements associated preferentially with RBP-Jκ latency or reactivation peaks, plus and minus Rta peaks, we employed discriminative DNA motif discovery (40Bailey T.L. Elkan C. Fitting a mixture model by expectation maximization to discover motifs in biopolymers.Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1994; 2 (7584402): 28-36PubMed Google Scholar). Many of the proteins that putatively bind to these motifs have published phenotypes in Notch signaling and/or herpesvirus infection; our data are the first to implicate these proteins as regulators of RBP-Jκ DNA binding. We include a combination of in vitro DNA binding and transactivation assays to evaluate the functional significance of the motifs in candidate target genes, focusing on the bidirectional viral ORF50AS/K-bZIP promoter. Our data point to a crucial role for multiple members of the cellular POU factors in regulating RBP-Jκ DNA binding, and we show that knockdown of one POU factor, Octamer-1, severely debilitates viral reactivation. Our new data set provides a basis for future analyses of regulated target promoter selectivity by RBP-Jκ–dependent transactivators. We recently tested a series of histone deacetylase inhibitors and showed that valproic acid (VPA) was one of the most efficient chemicals to reactivate KSHV from latency (41Shin H.J. DeCotiis J. Giron M. Palmeri D. Lukac D.M. Histone deacetylase classes I and II regulate Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus reactivation.J. Virol. 2014; 88 (24227836): 1281-129210.1128/JVI.02665-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). VPA's superior potency was evident by measuring viral gene expression and production of infectious virus. Therefore, we reasoned that VPA would be the ideal stimulus to distinguish latent from reactivation-specific Rta and RBP-Jκ–binding sites on the KSHV genome. Accordingly, we performed a ChIP-Seq experiment on chromatin isolated from infected PEL cells minus/plus VPA treatment. We chose 24 h post-VPA treatment as our reactivation time point; Rta was well-expressed, and a DE protein (ORF59) was beginning to appear (Fig. S1). We observed 104 Rta peaks (Fig. 2 and Table 1), 91 reactivation-specific RBP-Jκ peaks, and 97 latency-specific RBP-Jκ peaks. There were no significant Rta peaks detected during latency, when Rta is not expressed, as expected (data not shown).Table 1Number of Rta and RBP-Jκ peaks on KSHV genome in latency or reactivationAntibodyTreatmenta−VPA corresponds to latency; +VPA corresponds to reactivation.No. of peaksTotalIn promsbNumbers of peaks within promoters are shown.KineticscReplication kinetics of transcription start sites (as in Ref. 45) corresponding to promoters (DE = delayed early; L = late) are shown.No. per promRta+VPA10441DE1.110L0.7RBP-Jκ+VPA9139DE1.14L0.3−VPA9735DE1.03L0.2a −VPA corresponds to latency; +VPA corresponds to reactivation.b Numbers of peaks within promoters are shown.c Replication kinetics of transcription start sites (as in Ref. 45Lu M.

Open table in a new tab To identify the peaks that mapped to viral promoters, we compared the peak locations with the KSHV transcription start site (TSS) set (42Arias C. Weisburd B. Stern-Ginossar N.

Verma S.C. Cai Q. Saha A. Dzeng R.K. Robertson E.S. The RBP-Jκ binding sites within the RTA promoter regulate KSHV latent infection and cell proliferation.PLoS Pathog. 2012; 8 (22253595): e100247910.1371/journal.ppat.1002479Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Throughout this study, we define ORF50's promoter as the 2.7-kb region lying between the co-regulated ORF45 and ORF50 TSSs (44Zhu F.X. Cusano T. Yuan Y. Identification of the immediate-early transcripts of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus.J. Virol. 1999; 73 (10364304): 5556-5567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RBP-Jκ peaks predominate on DE, rather than L, promoters in both latency and reactivation, but the proportion of RBP-Jκ peaks on promoters increases during reactivation (Table 1; kinetics as in Ref. 45Lu M.

Rta peaks are also over-represented on promoters relative to nonpromoter DNA (data not shown). The data also show that several known targets of Rta and RBP-Jκ were represented (9Liang Y. Chang J.

Here, we investigated the metabolic impact of this intervention in 2-mo-old prediabetic University of California, Davis type 2 diabetes mellitus rats by assessing liver gene expression at 1.5 mo post-IT surgery. Pathway analysis indicated decreased signaling via TGF-β/Smad (a family of proteins named mothers against decapentaplegic homologs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), and PI3K-Akt-AMPK–mechanistic target of rapamycin, likely targeting hepatic stellate cells because differentiation and activation of these cells is associated with decreased signaling via PPAR and TGF-β/Smad. IT surgery up-regulated the expression of genes involved in regulation of cholesterol and terpenoid syntheses and down-regulated those involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism [including cardiolipin (CL)], lipogenesis, and gluconeogenesis. Consistent with the down-regulation of the hepatic CL pathway, IT surgery produced a metabolic switch in liver, kidney cortex, and fat depots toward decreased mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, the process required to fuel high energy–demanding pathways (e.g., gluconeogenesis and glyceroneogenesis), whereas opposite effects were observed in skeletal and cardiac muscles. This study demonstrates for the first time the presence of metabolic pathways that complement the effects of IT surgery to maximize its benefits and potentially identify similarly effective, durable, and less invasive therapeutic options for metabolic disease, including inhibitors of TGF-β signaling.—Hung, C., Napoli, E., Ross-Inta, C., Graham, J., Flores-Torres, A.

https://openalex.org/W2962297896,"Prostate cancer was the most common form and had the second highest death rate of male cancer in the United States in 2015. Current diagnosis techniques, such as prostate-specific antigen tests, transrectal ultrasound scans, and biopsies, are often inconclusive, and in the latter case, invasive. Here, we explore the use of clofazimine hydrochloride nanoparticles (CFZ-HCl NPs), a repurposed formulation from an FDA-approved antimycobacterial agent, as a photoacoustic contrast agent for the evaluation of prostate cancer due to its macrophage-targeting capabilities and high optical absorbance at 495 nm. Using a transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mouse model, our results indicate a preferential accumulation of intravenously injected CFZ-HCl NPs in cancerous prostates over normal prostates. Differences in accumulation of CFZ-HCl NPs between cancerous and normal prostates were determined using a two-wavelength unmixing technique via ex vivo photoacoustic imaging. Thus, intravenous injection of CFZ-HCl NPs leads to differences in the interactions of the particles with cancerous vs normal prostates, while allowing for photoacoustic detection and analysis of prostate cancer. These findings could lead to the development of a new noninvasive technique for the detection and monitoring of prostate cancer progression in an animal model that can potentially be translated to human patients."
