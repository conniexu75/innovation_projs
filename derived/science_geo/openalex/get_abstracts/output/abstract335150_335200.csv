https://openalex.org/W2018256378,"The isoprenoid hydrocarbons, phytane (C(20)H(42)) and pristane (C(19)H(40)), are present in the oil seeping from the Precambrian Nonesuch formation at the White Pine Mine, Michigan. Gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry provide the isolation and identification procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2073051472,"A billion-year-old shale from the Nonesuch formation at White Pine Mine, Michigan, contains microfossils, porphyrins, and optically active alkanes. Pristane and phytane, which are isoprenoid hydrocarbons found in living plants and animals, are constituents of the ancient alkanes in the Nonesuch shale; the presence of porphyrins in this Precambrian sediment suggests that photosynthetic organisms have existed for more than a billion years."
https://openalex.org/W2071042755,"Hydrostatic pressures in laticiferous phloem tissues of Hevea brasiliensis trees exhibit a diurnal fluctuation, with minimum values occurring during the day. Pressure decreases with increasing height up the trunk, the gradient becoming greater under conditions of rapid transpiration. Sieve-tube turgor must be controlled independently if pressure-flow is to occur in the expected direction."

https://openalex.org/W1991309060,"After the intense Alaskan earthquake of 27 March 1964, unusual waves up to 6 feet (about 2 meters) in height occurred at about the time of arrival of seismic waves at many localities along the coasts of Louisiana and Texas. The parameters of local channels at the tide gauge in Freeport, Texas (the only instrument to record significant waves) yield seiche periods close to those of the seismic surface waves suggesting that the water waves were generated by and in resonance with the seismic waves."
https://openalex.org/W2071945672,"Exudation of sap was never observed to occur from stumps of detopped seedlings of loblolly pine or white spruce, but measurable exudation occurred from apical root segments, 4 to 8 centimeters long, which were removed from the root systems and observed individually. Fully suberized root segments of loblolly pine exuded as much or more sap than unsuberized roots. Exudation also occurred from detached sugar maple root segments, but not from stumps attached to entire root systems."
https://openalex.org/W1984860233,"The far-infrared spectral region (10-100 cm(-1)) is a fruitful one for studies of solids. The experimental obstacle of weak sources has been partially overcome in recent years by the introduction of very sensitive bolometric radiation detectors cooled by liquid helium to temperatures near 1 degrees K. Used with a mercury arc source and a simple grating monochromator, these detectors have made work in a number of areas of solid-state physics possible. Important examples of such work are, (i) demonstration of the energy gap in superconductors and measurement of gap widths in various metals; (ii) observation of magnetic resonances in ordered magnetic materials, from which precise information about exchange fields and anisotropy energies can be obtained; and (iii) demonstration of the existence of a temperature-dependent low-frequency vibrational mode associated with the Curie-law dielectric constant in certain types of ferroelectric crystals."

https://openalex.org/W1965876724,The equation of the perimeter of the recorded area of zero-level precession photographs as a function of the orientation error is derived in polar coordinates. The angle between the tangent to the perimeter and the radius vector is also derived. How these relations can be conveniently applied to determining the orientation error of a crystal mounted on the precession instrument is discussed.
