https://openalex.org/W2017511982,"Helen Hobbs and colleagues report an association between coding variation in PNPLA3 and susceptibility to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The associated alleles vary in frequency among Hispanics, African Americans and European Americans and contribute to differences in disease prevalence among these ancestry groups. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a burgeoning health problem of unknown etiology that varies in prevalence among ancestry groups. To identify genetic variants contributing to differences in hepatic fat content, we carried out a genome-wide association scan of nonsynonymous sequence variations (n = 9,229) in a population comprising Hispanic, African American and European American individuals. An allele in PNPLA3 (rs738409[G], encoding I148M) was strongly associated with increased hepatic fat levels (P = 5.9 × 10−10) and with hepatic inflammation (P = 3.7 × 10−4). The allele was most common in Hispanics, the group most susceptible to NAFLD; hepatic fat content was more than twofold higher in PNPLA3 rs738409[G] homozygotes than in noncarriers. Resequencing revealed another allele of PNPLA3 (rs6006460[T], encoding S453I) that was associated with lower hepatic fat content in African Americans, the group at lowest risk of NAFLD. Thus, variation in PNPLA3 contributes to ancestry-related and inter-individual differences in hepatic fat content and susceptibility to NAFLD."

https://openalex.org/W2126711569,"Munger et al. show that infection with human cytomegalovirus upregulates fatty acid biosynthesis and that pharmacological inhibition of this pathway inhibits replication of both this virus and influenza A. This approach, the first to reliably map major carbon fluxes in mammalian cells, extends the promise of metabolomics from diagnostic applications to identification of new therapeutic concepts. Viruses rely on the metabolic network of their cellular hosts to provide energy and building blocks for viral replication. We developed a flux measurement approach based on liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry to quantify changes in metabolic activity induced by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). This approach reliably elucidated fluxes in cultured mammalian cells by monitoring metabolome labeling kinetics after feeding cells 13C-labeled forms of glucose and glutamine. Infection with HCMV markedly upregulated flux through much of the central carbon metabolism, including glycolysis. Particularly notable increases occurred in flux through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and its efflux to the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis suppressed the replication of both HCMV and influenza A, another enveloped virus. These results show that fatty acid synthesis is essential for the replication of two divergent enveloped viruses and that systems-level metabolic flux profiling can identify metabolic targets for antiviral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2080399344,"The role of the Toll-like receptors TLR9 and TLR7 in mediating autoimmune disease to self nucleic acid is now well appreciated, yet the mechanisms preventing rampant autoimmunity remain largely unknown. Here Ewald et al. define the route by which TLR9 and TLR7 exit the endoplasmic reticulum and travel to endolysosomes in mouse macrophages and dendritic cells. TLR9 activation is shown to require proteolytic cleavage in the endolysosome. This may be a strategy to restrict receptor activation to endolysosomal compartments and prevent TLRs from responding to self nucleic acids. Endolysosomal proteolytric cleavage is shown to be required for TLR9 activation by CpG Mammalian Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3, 7, 8 and 9 initiate immune responses to infection by recognizing microbial nucleic acids1,2; however, these responses come at the cost of potential autoimmunity owing to inappropriate recognition of self nucleic acids3. The localization of TLR9 and TLR7 to intracellular compartments seems to have a role in facilitating responses to viral nucleic acids while maintaining tolerance to self nucleic acids, yet the cell biology regulating the transport and localization of these receptors remains poorly understood4,5,6. Here we define the route by which TLR9 and TLR7 exit the endoplasmic reticulum and travel to endolysosomes in mouse macrophages and dendritic cells. The ectodomains of TLR9 and TLR7 are cleaved in the endolysosome, such that no full-length protein is detectable in the compartment where ligand is recognized. Notably, although both the full-length and cleaved forms of TLR9 are capable of binding ligand, only the processed form recruits MyD88 on activation, indicating that this truncated receptor, rather than the full-length form, is functional. Furthermore, conditions that prevent receptor proteolysis, including forced TLR9 surface localization, render the receptor non-functional. We propose that ectodomain cleavage represents a strategy to restrict receptor activation to endolysosomal compartments and prevent TLRs from responding to self nucleic acids."
https://openalex.org/W2169105416,"Industrial penicillin production with the filamentous fungus Penicillium chrysogenum is based on an unprecedented effort in microbial strain improvement. To gain more insight into penicillin synthesis, we sequenced the 32.19 Mb genome of P. chrysogenum Wisconsin54-1255 and identified numerous genes responsible for key steps in penicillin production. DNA microarrays were used to compare the transcriptomes of the sequenced strain and a penicillinG high-producing strain, grown in the presence and absence of the side-chain precursor phenylacetic acid. Transcription of genes involved in biosynthesis of valine, cysteine and alpha-aminoadipic acid-precursors for penicillin biosynthesis-as well as of genes encoding microbody proteins, was increased in the high-producing strain. Some gene products were shown to be directly controlling beta-lactam output. Many key cellular transport processes involving penicillins and intermediates remain to be characterized at the molecular level. Genes predicted to encode transporters were strongly overrepresented among the genes transcriptionally upregulated under conditions that stimulate penicillinG production, illustrating potential for future genomics-driven metabolic engineering."

https://openalex.org/W2113326963,"Ca(2+)-release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) channels underlie sustained Ca(2+) signalling in lymphocytes and numerous other cells after Ca(2+) liberation from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). RNA interference screening approaches identified two proteins, Stim and Orai, that together form the molecular basis for CRAC channel activity. Stim senses depletion of the ER Ca(2+) store and physically relays this information by translocating from the ER to junctions adjacent to the plasma membrane, and Orai embodies the pore of the plasma membrane calcium channel. A close interaction between Stim and Orai, identified by co-immunoprecipitation and by Förster resonance energy transfer, is involved in the opening of the Ca(2+) channel formed by Orai subunits. Most ion channels are multimers of pore-forming subunits surrounding a central channel, which are preassembled in the ER and transported in their final stoichiometry to the plasma membrane. Here we show, by biochemical analysis after cross-linking in cell lysates and intact cells and by using non-denaturing gel electrophoresis without cross-linking, that Orai is predominantly a dimer in the plasma membrane under resting conditions. Moreover, single-molecule imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Orai expressed in Xenopus oocytes showed predominantly two-step photobleaching, again consistent with a dimeric basal state. In contrast, co-expression of GFP-tagged Orai with the carboxy terminus of Stim as a cytosolic protein to activate the Orai channel without inducing Ca(2+) store depletion or clustering of Orai into punctae yielded mostly four-step photobleaching, consistent with a tetrameric stoichiometry of the active Orai channel. Interaction with the C terminus of Stim thus induces Orai dimers to dimerize, forming tetramers that constitute the Ca(2+)-selective pore. This represents a new mechanism in which assembly and activation of the functional ion channel are mediated by the same triggering molecule."

https://openalex.org/W2129340811,"Neurosteroids are powerful modulators of brain function and behavior, yet their dynamics in the brain have remained elusive. Using in vivo microdialysis in male zebra finches, we found that local estradiol levels increased rapidly in the forebrain during social interactions with females. Furthermore, when males were exposed to other males' songs, local estradiol levels also increased and testosterone levels dropped in a cortical/pallial auditory region that is analogous to mammalian auditory cortex. We also found that local estradiol and testosterone levels were differentially regulated in this same region by the conventional neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA, respectively. This study provides direct evidence that forebrain steroid levels are acutely and differentially regulated during social behavior in a region-specific manner and in a rapid time course similar to that of traditional neuromodulators."
https://openalex.org/W2015354948,"Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) phosphorylates sphingosine to form sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and is a critical regulator of sphingolipid-mediated functions. Cell-based studies suggest a tumor-promoting function for the SphK1/S1P pathway. Also, our previous studies implicated the SphK1/S1P pathway in the induction of the arachidonic acid cascade, a major inflammatory pathway involved in colon carcinogenesis. Therefore, we investigated whether the SphK1/S1P pathway is necessary for mediating carcinogenesis in vivo. Here, we report that 89% (42/47) of human colon cancer samples stained positively for SphK1, whereas normal colon mucosa had negative or weak staining. Adenomas had higher expression of SphK1 vs. normal mucosa, and colon cancers with metastasis had higher expression of SphK1 than those without metastasis. In the azoxymethane (AOM) murine model of colon cancer, SphK1 and S1P were significantly elevated in colon cancer tissues compared to normal mucosa. Moreover, blood levels of S1P were higher in mice with colon cancers than in those without cancers. Notably, SphK1(-/-) mice subjected to AOM had significantly less aberrant crypt foci (ACF) formation and significantly reduced colon cancer development. These results are the first in vivo evidence that the SphK1/S1P pathway contributes to colon carcinogenesis and that inhibition of this pathway is a potential target for chemoprevention."

Absorption spectroscopy was performed on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 9 spectrometer that has been updated with Lambda 90 software and coupled to an integrating sphere detector so that light scattered from the liposomes was collected and did not contribute to measured absorption. Determination of iron nitrosylation of cyt c was performed using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy using an EMX 10/12 spectrometer cooled to 110 K using liquid helium. The spectrum was operated at 9.4 GHz, 5-G modulation, 10.1-milliwatt power, 81.92-ms time constant, and 83.8-s scan over 1000 G. The concentrations of nitrosyl cyt c were determined by performing the double integral of the spectra and comparing this to a standard. As iron nitrosyl species from different heme proteins should produce similar sized signals, we initially fit the nitrosyl cyt c to basis spectra for iron nitrosyl hemoglobin as described previously (39Xu X.L. Lockamy V.L. Chen K.J. Huang Z. Shields H. King S.B. Ballas S.K. Nichols J.S. Gladwin M.T. Noguchi C.T. Schechter A.N. Kim-Shapiro D.B. J. Biol.

Briefly, high quality basis spectra of betanitrosyl, pentacoodinate alphanitrosyl, and hexacoodinate alphanitrosyl spectra were made and normalized to concentration. Linearity in concentration determination has been conducted in our laboratory many times in micromolar to millimolar ranges and specifically confirmed for this experiment. A nitrosyl cyt c basis spectrum was also made by reaction of 5 μm nitrite with cyt c and confirmation that 5 μm nitrosyl cyt c was made using Hb basis spectra. Subsequent fitting for concentration determination with either cyt c or Hb basis spectra gave similar results with 10% or less difference. Cyt c was reduced using either 2.5 mm sodium dithionite or a 10-fold molar excess ascorbate. In many experiments, the reducing agent was removed by passing the sample through two consecutive G-25 Sephadex columns. In some experiments, sodium dithionite was not removed as it has been shown recently that dithionite does not effectively reduce nitrite (40Grubina R. Basu S. Tiso M. Kim-Shapiro D.B. Gladwin M.T. J.

To make sure that dithionite would not effectively reduce nitrite under experimental conditions used in this study, 2.5 mm sodium dithionite was placed into the reaction reservoir of a Sievers 280i Nitric Oxide Analyzer (GE Analytical Instruments, Boulder, CO), and nitrite was injected. No significant signal corresponding to NO formation was measured for nitrite injected at 100 μm, 500 μm, or 1 mm concentrations (data not shown), whereas the assay is sensitive to formation of submicromolar concentrations of NO. Nitrite reductase activity was measured by mixing reduced cyt c (100 μm) with lipids (4 mm) and then adding nitrite (5 μm to 5 mm). All solutions were purged with argon to remove oxygen. Cyt c nitrosylation was monitored by either absorption spectroscopy or EPR. For EPR, aliquots of the samples were frozen as a function of time after mixing. All data are reported in the text as averages with standard deviations from three separate trials. Submitochondrial particles (SMP) were isolated by sonication of liver mitochondria in SMP buffer (sucrose (300 mm), MOPS (5 mm), EGTA (1 mm), KH2PO4 (5 mm), pH 7.4, 4 °C) followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g and one wash of the pellet. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The SMPs were >99% pure, as determined by measuring citrate synthase activity as a marker of mitochondrial matrix contamination. NO and oxygen concentrations were measured simultaneously using Clark type electrodes (WPI, Sarasota, FL and Instech, Plymouth Landing, MA, respectively). All measurements were made in a sealed, stirred chamber at 37 °C. Data were collected using a digital recording device (DATAQ Instruments, Akron, OH). The amount of NO generated (in electrode experiments) was quantified by integrating the measured NO curve over the initial 10-min period. In respiration experiments, SMPs were incubated in respiration buffer (KCl (120 mm), Hepes (3 mm), EGTA (1 mm), sucrose (25 mm), MgCl2 (5 mm), KH2PO4 (5 mm) with NADH (1 mm)) to stimulate respiration. To measure the inhibition of respiration, SMPs were allowed to consume oxygen until the respiratory chamber became anaerobic. Once all the oxygen was consumed, the lid of the chamber was opened to allow equilibration of the SMP suspension with room air. The oxygen trace did not immediately increase upon removal of the lid due to the high rate of oxygen consumption by the respiring SMPs. However, as soon as substrate was exhausted or respiration was inhibited, the oxygen concentration increased in the chamber. To determine the extent of inhibition, the time from when the lid of the chamber was opened to the time that the oxygen trace deviated from zero was measured and called “time to inhibition.” This time was compared with the time to inhibition of substrate exhaustion (0% inhibited) and the time to inhibition in the presence of cyanide (100% inhibition) as described previously (6Shiva S. Huang Z. Grubina R. Sun J.H. Ringwood L.A. MacArthur P.H. Xu X.L. Murphy E. Darley-Usmar V.M. Gladwin M.T. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 654-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Initial studies examined whether cyt c could reduce nitrite to NO by examining the formation of iron-nitrosyl heme. Cyt c (96 μm) was incubated with liposomes that promote heme iron pentacoordination, in an anaerobic environment at pH 5.4 and monitored using absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 1A). Addition of liposomes to the reduced cyt c (in which the reducing agent was removed using G-25 columns) blue-shifted the Soret bands and partially converted the two peaks around 520 nm and 549 nm to a single one, consistent with partial pentacoordination of the heme. Addition of the NO donor ProliNONOate to the mixture of cyt c and liposomes red shifted the spectrum giving a peak at 416 nm in the Soret and giving two peaks at 530 and 564 nm that were similar in intensity. This spectrum is similar to that of nitrosylated cyt c measured at pH 6.8 (which has peaks at 417, 529, and 562 nm (42Butt W.D. Keilin D. Proc. Royal Soc. London - Series B. Biol. Sci. 1962; 156: 429-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar)). The spectrum obtained upon addition of 5 mm nitrite to the cyt c is consistent with a mixture of oxidized (FeIII) cyt c and iron nitrosyl cyt c as predicted by Reactions 1 and 2. Formation of iron nitrosyl cyt c is confirmed by EPR (Fig. 1B). No signal is observed with cytochrome c in the absence of liposomes with or without the addition of nitrite. In the sample containing liposomes, addition of ProliNONOate resulted in a triplet hyperfine signal that is characteristic of a pentacoordinate nitrosyl heme. Likewise, a similar (although smaller) signal is observed upon addition of nitrite. The nitrosyl signals observed here are similar to those in previous reports in which another NO donor (DEANOate) was added to a similar liposome and cyt c mixture and the observed nitrosyl signal was attributed to about 70% pentacoordinate (iron bound to the heme and NO) and 30% hexacoordiante (iron bound to heme, histidine 18, and NO) nitrosyl heme (38Kapralov A.A. Kurnikov I.V. Vlasova, II, Belikova N.A. Tyurin V.A. Basova L.V. Zhao Q. Tyurina Y.Y. Jiang J.F. Bayir H. Vladimirov Y.A. Kagan V.E. Biochemistry-US. 2007; 46: 14232-14244Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained when ascorbate rather than dithionite was used to reduce the cytochrome c, and no signal was seen in the absence of liposomes (data not shown). To determine whether the nitrite reductase activity of cyt c might be relevant to certain physiological or pathophysiological conditions, the oxygen and pH dependence was examined (Fig. 2). Cyt c was reduced with sodium dithionite and passed through two G-25 columns under aerobic conditions. Incubation of cyt c and nitrite in the absence of liposomes did not produce any nitrosyl cyt c. When the reduced cyt c was incubated with 5 mm nitrite in the presence of liposomes under anaerobic conditions at pH 5.4, iron nitrosyl cyt c was formed (Fig. 2A). However, when the measurement was repeated incubating in air-equilibrated buffer, no signal was observed (Fig. 2A). When this experiment (using 5 mm nitrite) was repeated at 1% oxygen 5 ± 1 μm nitrosyl cyt c was made after 16 min; however, when the nitrite concentration was decreased to 5 μm nitrite at 1% oxygen, no nitrosyl cyt c was detected (data not shown). These results are consistent with those described below using an NO electrode showing NO generation from cyt c is dramatically inhibited by oxygen. The pH dependence of the nitrite reductase activity of cyt c was studied under anaerobic conditions in the presence of dithionite (which does not reduce nitrite under the conditions studied). The reductase activity as measured by iron nitrosyl cyt c formation, was greatest at the lowest pH studied (5.4) where an average of 5.6 ± 0.4 μm nitrosyl cyt c was made (n = 3) and became smaller approaching neutral pH (Fig. 2B). At pH 6 substantial nitrosyl cyt c was formed (1.89 ± 0.12 μm), but much less was made at pH 6.4 and 7.4 (0.63 ± 0.01 and 0.28 ± 0.08 μm, respectively, n = 3). The time course of cyt c-dependent nitrite reduction was assessed by measuring iron-nitrosyl cyt c formation upon addition of nitrite to cyt c under anaerobic conditions. Fig. 3A shows EPR spectra of nitrosyl cyt c growing as a function of time after the addition of 5 μm nitrite. Even after only 1 min, substantial nitroysl cyt c is made indicating that, under these low pH (5.4) conditions, nitrite is reduced rapidly by cyt c (Fig. 3A). The kinetics of nitrosyl cyt c formation when 100 μm cyt c is mixed with 4 mm liposomes, 2.5 mm sodium dithionite, and varying amounts of nitrite is shown in Fig. 3B. Importantly, it is seen that substantial nitrosyl cyt c is made by the time the first aliquot is collected for EPR (1 min after the reaction is initiated by nitrite addition). The yield of nitrosyl cyt c made after 1 min is dependent on nitrite concentration (Fig. 3C). Nitrosyl cyt c yield increases as the concentration of added nitrite increases from 5 μm to 500 μm, but is not further increased at this point. At high concentrations of nitrite (500 μm and 5 mm) the nitrosyl cyt c yield continues to increase slowly after the initial minute of fast growth (Fig. 3B). To further characterize the nitrite reductase activity of cytochrome c, NO formation and oxygen tension were measured simultaneously at pH 6.5 and 37 °C using conventional electrodes. Reduced cytochrome c (200 μm) was incubated with liposomes and nitrite (5 mm) and sodium dithionite was added to decrease the oxygen concentration. No generation of NO was observed until the chamber became completely anoxic, after which NO was generated and remained at a steady state for at least 15 min. The addition of oxyhemoglobin (200 μm) caused a rapid and immediate drop in the NO trace, confirming that it was indeed authentic NO that was being measured (Fig. 4A). Nitric oxide could not be detected in the absence of liposomes, in the absence of cyt c, or at a pH greater than 6.9 (data not shown). To determine whether cyt c could contribute to NO generation in its physiological setting within the mitochondrial electron transport chain, SMP, which are devoid of cytochrome c and mitochondrial matrix proteins, were used as a model of the electron transport chain. Because cytochrome c oxidase has been shown to be a nitrite reductase, NO generation by the respiratory chain in the absence of pentacoordinate cyt c was first measured. In the presence of nitrite (5 mm), cyt c (200 μm) and NADH (to stimulate respiration), the SMPs (2 mg/ml) generated 3.61 ± 0.14 μm NO in 10 min, similar to previously published levels of NO generation by mitochondria and isolated cytochrome c oxidase (Fig. 4B). When liposomes (4:1 lipid to cyt c ratio) were added to generate pentacoordinate cyt c, the NO generated in 10 min (4.38 ± 0.23 μm) was significantly greater than NO generation by SMPs or pentacoordinate cyt c alone (1.7 ± 0.21 μm) (Fig. 4, C and D). To determine whether the nitrite reductase activity of cyt c could play a role in cellular respiration we tested whether NO generated by cyt c could inhibit oxygen consumption by cytochrome c oxidase at pH 6.5 (Fig. 5). To measure respiration at low oxygen tensions, we used a conventional oxygen electrode in a sealed chamber and allowed the respiring SMPs to make the chamber anoxic. Once anoxic, the lid of the chamber was opened to allow equilibration of the solution with ambient air. In this experiment, the time from the removal of the lid to the time that the oxygen trace deviates from zero correlates inversely to the extent of inhibition, with a shorter time to inhibition indicative of a greater extent of inhibition (Fig. 5A, see “Experimental Procedures” for details). In the absence of liposomes, the addition of nitrite (30 μm) significantly inhibited respiration (28 ± 9% inhibition) due to the NO generated by cytochrome c oxidase itself. To increase pentacoordination of cyt c, increasing concentrations of liposomes were added. Increasing lipid decreased respiratory rate consistent with the decreased ability of pentacoordinated cyt c to transfer electrons to cytochrome c oxidase (38Kapralov A.A. Kurnikov I.V. Vlasova, II, Belikova N.A. Tyurin V.A. Basova L.V. Zhao Q. Tyurina Y.Y. Jiang J.F. Bayir H. Vladimirov Y.A. Kagan V.E. Biochemistry-US. 2007; 46: 14232-14244Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However at each lipid concentration, respiration in the presence of nitrite was inhibited significantly compared with the respective control (Fig. 5B). Moreover, as pentacoordinated cyt c was increased, the extent of inhibition was also increased (29.6 ± 11% and 48.5 ± 16% inhibition at 4:1 and 25:1 lipid: cyt c ratios, respectively), presumably due to greater NO generation by cyt c (Fig. 5C). Here, the percentage inhibition is calculated as the amount of inhibition with nitrite to that without nitrite for each lipid concentration. These data suggest that pentacoordinate cyt c can generate bioavailable NO and that the NO generated can mediate signaling in the mitochondrion. We have shown that when cyt c is placed under conditions where the heme becomes pentacoordinate, it functions as a nitrite reductase. This activity is most effective at low pH and in the absence of oxygen. Further, we show that this novel function for cyt c can generate bioavailable NO that can regulate mitochondrial respiration. Kinetic analysis of nitrite reduction by cytochrome c shows that the formation of nitrosyl cyt c is fast (Fig. 3). The rate of formation of nitrosyl cyt c is related to the rate of nitrite reduction. The high equilibrium constant (2.9 × 105 m-1 for hexacoordinate and about 100 times higher for pentacoordinate), and slow dissociation constant (2.9 × 10-5 s-1) (43Osipov A.N. Borisenko G.G. Vladimirov Y.A. Biochem.-Moscow. 2007; 72: 1491-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 44Ascenzi P. Coletta M. Santucci R. Polizio F. Desideri A. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1994; 53: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) insures that once NO binds to cyt c, it is not likely to come off on the time scale of our experiments. The association constant of NO to hexacoordinate cyt c is only 8.3 m-1 s-1 (43Osipov A.N. Borisenko G.G. Vladimirov Y.A. Biochem.-Moscow. 2007; 72: 1491-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but is likely to be at least 100 times faster for pentacoordinate cyt c (44Ascenzi P. Coletta M. Santucci R. Polizio F. Desideri A. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1994; 53: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). There are, however, additional factors that mitigate cyt c NO yield. Only the pentacoordinate form of cyt c (which is induced by the liposomes but there is always still substantial hexacoordinate cyt c present) can easily bind NO and easily react with nitrite. However, when NO binds to one heme, that heme is no longer capable of further reactions with nitrite. This contributes to an element of auto-inhibition. While the fina"

The PHA-skin test, involving subcutaneous injection of a mitogen (phytohemagglutinin, PHA) and measurement of subsequent swelling as a surrogate of T-cell mediated immunocompetence, has been the test of choice due to its practicality and ease of use in the field. However, mechanisms involved in local immunological and inflammatory processes provoked by PHA are poorly known, and its use and interpretation as an acquired immune response is currently debated.Here, we present experimental work using a variety of parrot species, to ascertain whether PHA exposure produces larger secondary than primary responses as expected if the test reflects acquired immunocompetence. Moreover, we simultaneously quantified T-lymphocyte subsets (CD4(+), CD5(+) and CD8(+)) and plasma proteins circulating in the bloodstream, potentially involved in the immunological and inflammatory processes, through flow cytometry and electrophoresis.Our results showed stronger responses after a second PHA injection, independent of species, time elapsed and changes in body mass of birds between first and second injections, thus supporting the adaptive nature of this immune response. Furthermore, the concomitant changes in the plasma concentrations of T-lymphocyte subsets and globulins indicate a causal link between the activation of the T-cell mediated immune system and local tissue swelling.These findings justify the widespread use of the PHA-skin test as a reliable evaluator of acquired T-cell mediated immunocompetence in diverse biological disciplines. Further experimental research should be aimed at evaluating the relative role of innate immunocompetence in wild conditions, where the access to dietary proteins varies more than in captivity, and to ascertain how PHA responses relate to particular host-parasite interactions."

Recently it was proposed as a marker with a potential role in carcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the biological function of UCH-L1 in tumor cells is poorly understood. We found that UCH-L1 is highly expressed in non-small lung cancer cell line H157, having high invasive potential, and that the expression of UCH-L1 in tumor cells enhances their invasive potential in vitro and in vivo. UCH-L1 changes cell morphology by regulating cell adhesion through Akt-mediated pathway. Suppressing UCH-L1 expression by RNAi significantly suppressed the invasion in vitro and in vivo, and the activation of Akt and downstream mitogen activated protein kinases c-Jun N-terminal kinases and p38, but not ERK. In Akt-negative mutants, overexpression of UCH-L1 does not affect the invasion and migration capability of H157 cells. These results suggest that UCH-L1 is a key molecule to regulate tumor-cell invasion by upstream activation of Akt."
https://openalex.org/W1991616317,"Under some in vitro conditions, neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei show a phenomenon called rebound potentiation, where, following a strong hyperpolarization, their membrane potential briefly rebounds to a more depolarized level causing a transient increase in firing rate. The authors, however, found that under more physiological conditions in vitro or in vivo, deep cerebellar nuclei neurons rarely showed rebound potentiation. This finding necessitates a re-evaluation of some cerebellar models, where rebound potentiation was postulated to be involved in plasticity and/or information processing. A key component of recent theories on cerebellar function is rebound firing in neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). Despite the robustness of this phenomenon in vitro, in vivo studies have provided little evidence for its prevalence. We found that intact mouse or rat DCN neurons rarely showed rebound firing under physiological conditions in vitro or in vivo. These observations necessitate a critical re-evaluation of recent cerebellar models."

https://openalex.org/W1568167685,"Structural changes in the dendrites are mediated in part by a cell adhesion molecule, β-catenin, and are associated with memory formation and maintenance. A new study by Maguschak and Ressler shows that β-catenin has a selective role in fear memory consolidation. β-catenin has been implicated in neuronal synapse regulation and remodeling. Here we have examined β-catenin expression in the adult mouse brain and its role in amygdala-dependent learning and memory. We found alterations in β-catenin mRNA and protein phosphorylation during fear-memory consolidation. Such alterations correlated with a change in the association of β-catenin with cadherin. Pharmacologically, this consolidation was enhanced by lithium-mediated facilitation of β-catenin. Genetically, the role of β-catenin was confirmed with site-specific deletions of loxP-flanked Ctnnb1 (encoding β-catenin) in the amygdala. Baseline locomotion, anxiety-related behaviors and acquisition or expression of conditioned fear were normal. However, amygdala-specific deletion of Ctnnb1 prevented the normal transfer of newly formed fear learning into long-term memory. Thus, β-catenin may be required in the amygdala for the normal consolidation, but not acquisition, of fear memory. This suggests a general role for β-catenin in the synaptic remodeling and stabilization underlying long-term memory in adults."
https://openalex.org/W2164792033,"Nearby retinal ganglion cells show correlated activity in the absence of visual stimuli and these correlations are propagated across the population. A combination of recordings and computational modeling suggest that shared synaptic input is the origin of this synchrony. Cells throughout the CNS have synchronous activity patterns; that is, a cell's probability of generating an action potential depends both on its firing rate and on the occurrence of action potentials in surrounding cells. The mechanisms producing synchronous or correlated activity are poorly understood despite its prevalence and potential effect on neural coding. We found that neighboring parasol ganglion cells in primate retina received strongly correlated synaptic input in the absence of modulated light stimuli. This correlated variability appeared to arise through the same circuits that provide uncorrelated synaptic input. In addition, ON, but not OFF, parasol cells were coupled electrically. Correlated variability in synaptic input, however, dominated correlations in the parasol spike outputs and shared variability in the timing of action potentials generated by neighboring cells. These results provide a mechanistic picture of how correlated activity is produced in a population of neurons that are critical for visual perception."

Neuregulins comprise a family of four related genes (nrg1-4), each producing a large number of isoforms via differential promoter usage and alternative splicing (1Buonanno A. Fischbach G.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 2Mei L. Xiong W.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 437-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). NRGs contain EGF-like repeats, which enable them to bind to and activate EGF family receptors (ErbB2-4). Previous studies showed that NRG1 is initially synthesized as a transmembrane protein, which then undergoes proteolytic processing, whereby the extracellular EGF-containing fragment is released into the extracellular environment. The remaining intracellular fragment has been shown to translocate into the nucleus, where it regulates neuronal survival and transcription of PSD-95 (3Bao J. Wolpowitz D. Role L.W. Talmage D.A. J.

In the central nervous system NRG1 is also required for differentiation, migration, and development of neurons and glia as well as for axonal myelination and pathfinding, dendritic development, and neurotransmitter receptor maintenance. During development, NRG1-ErbB signaling mediates radial glia maintenance and elongation, whereas glial-derived NRG1 directs the migration of cortical and cerebellar neurons (7Anton E. Marchionni M.

In the brain and spinal cord, NRG1 regulates oligodendrocyte differentiation, and in spinal cord explants from NRG1-/- mice, oligodendrocytes fail to develop (10Calaora V. Rogister B. Bismuth K.

There are four members in the ErbB family, named one through four. However, ErbB1 specifically binds EGF and does not respond to NRG1. ErbB2 contains the functional kinase domain but is unable to bind NRG1 (13Klapper L.N. Glathe S. Vaisman N. Hynes N.E. Andrews G.C. Sela M. Yarden Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

ErbB3 on the other hand binds NRG1 but is unable to propagate the signal to the cells because of lack of kinase activity (14Guy P.M. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. Carraway III, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). ErbB4 is a single-pass, 160-kDa transmembrane protein with extra- and intracellular regions of approximately equal size (15Carpenter G. Exp.

A kinase domain is located within the intracellular region of ErbB4, which also contains a PDZ binding motif at the C terminus, enabling ErbB4 to interact with PDZ-domain containing proteins such as PSD-95 (17Huang Y.Z.

Several isoforms of ErbB4 occur due to alternative splicing of the gene: juxtamembrane-a and -b (JM-a and JM-b) isoforms differ in their sensitivity to proteolytic cleavage by TACE (tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme) metalloprotease, with only the JM-a isoform being sensitive to this cleavage (19Rio C.

The presence of multiple ErbB4 isoforms and their differential distribution may contribute to the diversity of ErbB4 signaling. Although the function of the soluble extracellular fragment is unknown, it raises the possibility of retrograde signaling (15Carpenter G. Exp.

Neurosci. 2002; 20: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the interaction between ErbB4 and PSD-95 is regulated by neuronal activity (22Xie F. Padival M. Siegel R.E. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 62-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the increased interaction between these proteins is detected in brain lysates from schizophrenia patients (23Hahn C.G. Wang H.Y. Cho D.S. Talbot K. Gur R.E. Berrettini W.H. Bakshi K. Kamins J. Borgmann-Winter K.E. Siegel S.J. Gallop R.J. Arnold S.E. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Moreover, previous findings showed that ErbB receptor-mediated NRG1 signaling modulates N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function (24Gu Z. Jiang Q. Fu A.K.Y. Ip N.Y. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4974-4984Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), indicating that NMDARs constitute an immediate target of NRG1/ErbB4 signaling. At the synapse, ErbB4 also interacts with and regulates activation of two non-receptor protein kinases, Fyn and pyk2. These molecules have been implicated in regulation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor phosphorylation and long term potentiation induction (25Bjarnadottir M. Misner D.L. Haverfield-Gross S. Bruun S. Helgason V.G. Stefansson H. Sigmundsson A. Firth D.R. Nielsen B. Stefansdottir R. Novak T.J. Stefansson K. Gurney M.E. Andresson T. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4519-4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Here we examine the role of ErbB4 in synapse maturation and neuronal morphology in primary hippocampal cultures by overexpressing wild-type and mutant forms of ErbB4, knocking down endogenous protein, and/or treating cells with NRG1. We show that, although ErbB4 is not sufficient to induce presynaptic differentiation in neuron-COS7 cell co-cultures, ectopic expression of ErbB4 in dissociated hippocampal neurons enhances the size of presynaptic terminals contacting ErbB4-expressing cells. Furthermore, knockdown of endogenous ErbB4 results in a decrease in the size of presynaptic protein clusters. Interestingly, the number of presynaptic terminals is unchanged in cells with altered ErbB4 expression, highlighting a trans-synaptic role for ErbB4 in synapse maturation but not initial formation. Finally, we show that stimulation of ErbB4 signaling by NRG1 alters process outgrowth via activation of the PI3K signaling pathway. cDNA Cloning and Mutagenesis—The original full-length ErbB4 (JM-a, CYT-2 isoform) cDNA and ErbB4 shRNA constructs were gifts from Dr. Lin Mei. HA-tagged transmembrane isoform of neuregulin-1 (HA-NRG1) was a gift from Dr. Jianxin Bao (Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, Georgia). The HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) was inserted after amino acid 997. HA-tagged wild type NL1 amplified from mouse cerebellum was a gift from Dr. Peter Scheiffele (Columbia University). GFP transfections were carried out using pEGFP-C1 plasmid (Clontech). The generation of ErbB4-HA, ErbB4-HA ΔPDZb, and ErbB4-HA ΔNT, was carried out by PCR subcloning in two steps. First, a construct that contains the ErbB4 signal sequence followed by the HA tag (ss-HA) was generated by PCR using oligonucleotides containing AflII and XbaI restriction sites followed by subcloning the resulting fragment into the pCDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen). Generation of the deletion mutants was carried out by PCR using oligonucleotides with the following restriction sites: ErbB4-HA ΔNT-NotI/XbaI (forward, ggactcGCGGCCGCCATTCCACTTTACCACAACATG; reverse, GGGCCCTCTAGATTACACCACAGTATTCC) and subcloning amplified fragments into the ss-HA construct. Finally, ErbB4-HA ΔPDZb was made by amplification of the intracellular region of ErbB4 using oligonucleotides containing KpnI and XbaI restriction sites (forward, GTATTTGGGTACCTGAAGGAG; reverse, GGGCCCTCTAGATTACCGGTGTCTGTAAGGTGG) and subcloning the resulting fragment into the ErbB4-HA ΔCT construct, restoring the full sequence of ErbB4 lacking only the last four amino acids. A single point mutation in the ErbB4 kinase domain (K751R) was introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Briefly, the entire plasmid was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides containing one base substitution (AAG → AGG) (GTGAAGATTCCTGTGGCTATTAGGATTCTTAATGAGACAACTGG), the template methylated strand was destroyed enzymatically with Dpn1, and purified construct was transformed into bacteria and verified by direct sequencing. All constructs were verified by direct sequencing. To suppress the expression of endogenous ErbB4, the pFUGW vectors expressing short hairpin RNAs specifically directed against rat ErbB4 (26Li B. Woo R.S. Mei L. Malinow R. Neuron. 2007; 54: 583-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) were transfected into hippocampal neurons using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) 3 or 5 days before. The target sequences of two short hairpin RNAs for erbB4 are 5′-CCAGACTACCTGCAGGAATAC-3′ (hp2) and 5′-GCCCGCAATGTGTTGGTGAAA-3′ (hp3). A vector expressing GFP was used as a control. Cell Culture and Mixed Culture Assay—Dissociated primary neuronal cultures were prepared from hippocampi of embryonic day 18/19 Wistar rats. Cells were dissociated by papain digestion followed by brief mechanical trituration and plated on poly-d (or l)-lysine (Sigma)-treated coverslips at a density of 105 per 8-mm glass coverslip in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), glucose (Sigma), sodium pyruvate, GlutaMAX, and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). After 2 h the medium was replaced with NeuroBasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B-27, GlutaMAX, and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) as previously described (27Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). Every 3-4 days, half of the volume of maintenance medium was taken out and replaced with fresh solution. Cultures were transfected by lipid-mediated gene transfer using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen) or by the calcium phosphate technique (Clontech) as previously described (28Jiang M. Deng L. Chen G. Gene Ther. 2004; 11: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). COS7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), sodium pyruvate, and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). For protein expression cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and collected/fixed 24-36 h later. Neuron-COS7 cell co-cultures were performed as previously described (29Graf E.R. Kang Y. Hauner A.M. Craig A.M. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 4256-4265Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, neurons were grown on glass coverslips suspended above a glial feeder layer in minimal essential medium with N2 supplements. COS7 cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and trypsinized 24 h later. Cells were washed twice with fetal bovine serum-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and plated onto neurons that had been pre-grown for 9-10 days. COS7 cells were allowed to adhere and grow on neurons for 24 h before fixation. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), sodium pyruvate, and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). For protein expression, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) for 12 h, grown for an additional 6 h, collected, and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. To examine transcellular interaction between proteins, cells transfected with the appropriate constructs were co-cultured on 10-mm glass coverslips (Fisher) and allowed to grow for 24 h before fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde supplemented with 4% sucrose (Sigma). Immunocytochemistry and Reagents—Coverslips were fixed in −20 °C methanol for staining for synaptic proteins or in 4% paraformaldehyde with 4% sucrose (Sigma) and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. The following primary antibody solutions were used: HA (mouse, 1:1000, Berkeley Antibody Co., Inc., and rat, 1:1000, Roche Applied Science), GFP (chicken, 1:1000, Abcam), synaptophysin (mouse, 1:1000, Sigma, and rabbit, 1:500, Pharmingen), VGLUT1 (rabbit, 1:1000, Synaptic Systems and guinea pig, 1:2000, Chemicon), VGAT (rabbit, 1:1000, Synaptic Systems and Chemicon), PSD-95 (mouse 1:500, Affinity BioReagents, and rabbit, custom made by Affinity BioReagents), gephyrin (mouse, 1:1000, Synaptic Systems), ErbB4 (mouse, 1:200, Neo-Markers, and rabbit, 1:200, Santa Cruz), MAP2 (mouse, 1:500, BD Pharmingen), and p-ErbB4 (mouse, Cell Signaling). Secondary antibodies were generated in goat and conjugated with Alexa 488 (1:1000), Alexa 568 (1:1000, Molecular Probes), or aminomethyl coumarin acetate (1:100, Jackson ImmunoResearch). All antibody reactions were performed in blocking solution containing 2% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Preparation and purification of the protein coding for the extracellular domain of ErbB4 fused to Fc (ecto-ErbB4) was previously described (30Woo R.S. Li X.M. Tao Y. Carpenter-Hyland E. Huang Y.Z.

Human recombinant NRG1 containing the EGF motif was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumin at a concentration of 10 mg/ml, separated into aliquots, and stored at −20 °C. PI3K inhibitor (LY 294002) and MAPK inhibitor (PD 98059) were purchased from Calbiochem and resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide at a concentration of 10 mm and 5 mg/ml, respectively, separated into aliquots, and stored at −20 °C. For tissue section immunohistochemistry, adult (postnatal day 120) female rat brains were rapidly extracted, embedded in OCT medium, and flash-frozen in isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen. Sections were cut on a cryostat at thicknesses of 8 mm to allow detection of synaptic puncta. Sections were kept frozen until fixation in −20 °C methanol for 10 min. After thorough washing in phosphate-buffered saline, sections were incubated in blocking solution (2.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton-X-100, 0.02% sodium azide) for 45 min followed by primary antibody diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. After washing, sections were incubated with Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies (fluorescent immunohistochemistry; Molecular Probes) and mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL). Western Blotting—To assess phosphorylation levels of ErbB4 deletion mutants, constructs were transfected into COS7 cells for 24 h, and proteins were analyzed by Western blot. COS7 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 protease inhibitor tablet/10 ml (Roche Applied Science). After extracting for 20 min at 4 °C, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Samples were boiled for 3 min upon the addition of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 1% bovine serum albumin or 5% milk and incubated with primary antibody solutions overnight at 4 °C. Western blot signals were detected with the Odyssey machine (Li-Cor) using infrared-conjugated antibodies as previously described (31Swayze R.D. Lise M.F. Levinson J.N. Phillips A. El-Husseini A. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 764-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Imaging and Analysis—Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axiovert M200 motorized microscope with a 63 × 1.4 NA ACROMAT oil immersion lens and a monochrome 14-bit Zeiss Axiocam HR charge-coupled camera with 1300 × 1030 pixels. The exposure time was adjusted per individual experiment to achieve maximal brightness without saturation; for intensity measurement experiments, all pictures were taken at equal exposure for all experimental conditions. To correct for out-of focus areas within the field of view, focal plane (z) stacks were collected, and maximum intensity projections were compiled. Images were scaled to 16 bits and analyzed in Northern Eclipse (Empix Imaging Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) using custom written software routines as previously described (32Prange O. Wong T.P. Gerrow K. Wang Y.T. El-Husseini A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13915-13920Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). In brief, images were processed at a constant threshold level (of 32,000 pixel values), and dendrites visualized by immunofluorescence signal were outlined. Only clusters with average pixel values three times greater than background (diffuse dendritic shaft pixel values) were selected for analysis. The number of dendritic clusters per unit length was measured as a function of dendritic length and normalized to controls. For intensity analysis, the average background intensity was subtracted from the average intensity of individual puncta and multiplied by the puncta area to obtain integrated intensity. For colocalization analysis, background-subtracted immunofluorescence clusters for all imaging channels (red, green, and blue) were correlated for overlapping signal. Colocalization was scored if clusters in two channels were overlapping by at least 1 pixel for a postsynaptic and presynaptic protein. Two-tailed Student's t test was performed to calculate the statistical significance of results between experimental groups. To quantify the extent of protein accumulation at the area of cell-cell contact in HEK cell experiments, a line was drawn through the area of contact, and pixel intensity was measured using ImageJ software. Average intensity was then normalized to the level of protein expression in the cell in question, which was determined by taking the average intensity along a line of equal length drawn through the cell body. To analyze the ability of ErbB4 expressed in heterologous cells to induce clustering of VGLUT1 and VGAT, a co-culture system was used. COS7 cells transfected with ErbB4 or NL1 were co-cultured with hippocampal neurons. Immunostaining for VGLUT1/PSD-95 and VGAT/gephyrin combinations was used to assess the induction of excitatory and inhibitory presynaptic terminals, respectively. Random ErbB4- or NL1-immunopositive COS cells showing contact with neuronal processes by phase contrast were classified as to whether they exhibited any associated clusters of VGLUT1 lacking PSD95 or VGAT lacking gephyrin (presumed induced clusters in the contacting axons). Localization of Endogenous ErbB4 at Excitatory and Inhibitory Synapses—Previous studies have demonstrated that ErbB4 expression is restricted to inhibitory GABAergic interneurons of the developing and adult cortex and hippocampus (33Flames N. Long J.E. Garratt A.N. Fischer T.M. Gassmann M. Birchmeier C. Lai C. Rubenstein J.L. Marin O. Neuron. 2004; 44: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 34Fox I.J.

Cortex. 2003; 13: 252-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, ErbB4 expression in dissociated hippocampal neurons at DIV 14 demonstrated a punctate pattern of immunostaining in neurons positive for the inhibitory neuronal markers, VGAT and GAD65 (the GABA synthesizing enzyme), with no signal detectable in GAD65-negative cells (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Other studies have demonstrated that ErbB4 clusters at synaptic sites and colocalizes with a number of markers for excitatory synapses, including the NR1 subunit of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors and PSD-95 (17Huang Y.Z. Won S. Ali D.W. Wang Q. Tanowitz M. Du Q.S. Pelkey K.A. Yang D.J. Xiong W.C. Salter M.W. Mei L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). As inhibitory neurons receive both excitatory and inhibitory inputs, we assessed the distribution of ErbB4 at excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Hippocampal neurons were double-labeled with ErbB4 and either VGLUT1 or VGAT, markers for excitatory or inhibitory presynaptic terminals, respectively (Fig. 1A). Consistent with previous findings, a significant proportion of ErbB4 clusters (64 ± 3%) was associated with VGLUT1-positive puncta (Fig. 1B). However, a smaller proportion of ErbB4 clusters (32 ± 6%) were apposed to VGAT puncta (Fig. 1B), indicating that ErbB4 is present not only at excitatory but also at a subset of inhibitory postsynaptic sites. Together these results indicate that ErbB4 is expressed in inhibitory GABAergic hippocampal interneurons and is localized largely at the postsynaptic compartment of excitatory synapses, with a smaller proportion found at inhibitory contacts. To confirm that the localization of ErbB4 at inhibitory contacts is not an artifact of the culture system, we immunostained adult rat brain sections for ErbB4 and the inhibitory postsynaptic marker, gephyrin. In the cortex and hippocampus, expression of ErbB4 was limited to GABAergic interneurons (data not shown). A proportion of ErbB4 clusters was colocalized with gephyrin, consistent with the localization of a subset of ErbB4 at inhibitory synapses (Fig. 1C). ErbB4 Overexpression Enhances the Maturation of Presynaptic Terminals—To determine the role of ErbB4 at the synapse at early stages of neuronal development, we generated an HA-tagged version of full-length ErbB4, placing the tag immediately after the tyrosine kinase domain to avoid interference with PDZ-dependent interactions (see Fig. A) (17Huang Y.Z. Won S. Ali D.W. Wang Q. Tanowitz M. Du Q.S. Pelkey K.A. Yang D.J. Xiong W.C. Salter M.W. Mei L. Neuron. 2000; 26: 443-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). This construct was then expressed in dissociated embryonic hippocampal neurons at DIV 5-6 followed by fixation at DIV 10-11, a period at which synaptogenesis occurs. Levels of ectopic ErbB4 expression in excitatory neurons were comparable with endogenous ErbB4 levels observed in inhibitory neurons (supplemental Fig. 1). Synapses were visualized by immunostaining cultures with the presynaptic terminal marker, synaptophysin (SYN) (Fig. 2A). Analysis revealed an increase"

Treatment of macrophages with lyso-PS enhanced the uptake of apoptotic cells in vitro, an effect that was dependent on signaling via the macrophage G2A receptor. Similarly, endogenously produced lyso-PS also enhanced the G2A-mediated uptake of activated PS-exposing (but non-apoptotic) neutrophils, raising the possibility of non-apoptotic mechanisms for removal of inflammatory cells during resolution. Finally, antibody blockade of G2A signaling in vivo prolonged zymosan-induced neutrophilia in wild-type mice, whereas having no effect in gp91phox-/- mice where lyso-PS are not generated. Taken together, we show that lyso-PS are modified PS species generated following activation of the NADPH oxidase and lyso-PS signaling through the macrophage G2A functions to enhance existing receptor/ligand systems for optimal resolution of neutrophilic inflammation.

Neutrophils are often robustly recruited early in inflammation. Within hours of their activation in tissues, they are removed by phagocytes, an event required for resolution of inflammation and the return to normalcy of tissue function. It is known that neutrophils undergoing apoptosis drive the production of anti-inflammatory mediators such as transforming growth factor-β that actively suppress production of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, eicosanoids, and nitric oxide (1Freire-de-Lima C.G.

In contrast to PS-derived signals that promote recognition and removal of apoptotic cells, other lipid-derived mediators released from cells, such as lipoxins, resolvins, and protectins, signaling through their cognate receptors, have been shown to play a role in orchestrating resolution of inflammation by enhancing these existing mechanisms for engulfment of apoptotic cells and tissue homeostasis (19Schwab J.M. Chiang N. Arita M. Serhan C.N. Nature. 2007; 447: 869-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). The exact PS species signaling for the recognition and removal of infiltrating neutrophils have not been fully elucidated. Given that recruited neutrophils robustly activate their NADPH oxidase, we reasoned that activated neutrophils would be an excellent source for the identification of additional oxPS species signaling for apoptotic cell engulfment and specifically for the resolution of neutrophilic inflammation. Here, we show that neutrophils generate trace amounts of previously identified oxPS species, but more striking was the production of nanogram quantities of lyso-PS species both in vitro and in vivo following activation of the NADPH oxidase. Lyso-PS species have been shown to be biologically active, signaling via G protein-coupled receptors (e.g. GPR34 on mast cells and via G2A on neutrophils (20Frasch S.C. Zemski-Berry K. Murphy R.C.

Our studies demonstrate that lyso-PS are modified PS species that signal via the macrophage G2A receptor to enhance existing receptor/ligand systems for the engulfment of PS exposing activated and apoptotic cells in vitro and in vivo. These data support inclusion of lyso-PS/G2A in the growing repertoire of lipid-derived signaling molecules and signaling receptors demonstrated to play a role in anti-inflammatory signaling and resolution of inflammation. Materials—All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) unless otherwise noted. Solvents, glucose, glucose oxidase, NaNO2, fMLP, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), methoxylamine hydrochloride (MOX), cytochrome c, and zymosan were from Sigma. Myeloperoxidase (MPO), diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), cPLA2α inhibitor, and bromoenol lactone were from EMD Biosciences (Gibbstown, NJ). Aminopropyl Sep-Pak (NH2-SPE) columns were from Supelco (subsidiary of Sigma). Flash red carboxylate-modified beads (5 μm) were from Bangs Labs (Fishers, IN). ONO-RS-082 was from Biomol International (Plymouth Meeting, PA). HLB reverse solid phase columns were from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA). Anti-G2A M-20 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Annexin V, Alexa 488, and anti-goat IgG Alexa 488 were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Lyso-PS internal standard (17:1/OH-PS) was a generous gift from Dr. Walter Shaw at Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Animals—Male and female C57BL/6 and gp91phox-/- mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and also used from a breeding colony at National Jewish Health (Denver, Colorado). All animals received care in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were maintained on food and water ad libitum. Mice between the ages of 8 and 16 weeks provided a source of resident peritoneal and thioglycollate-elicited MΦ and were age and gender matched for all experiments. Isolation and Culture of Murine Peritoneal MΦ—Thioglycollate (TG)-elicited peritoneal MΦ were obtained according to previously established methods (13Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1.5 ml of a 4% sterile and aged (3 month) solution of Brewer thioglycollate medium (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI). At 3 days post injection, mice were euthanized with CO2, and the peritoneal cavity lavaged with 5 ml of sterile Hanks' balanced salt solution (Cellgro, Kansas City, MO). Peritoneal cells were collected, centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and plated at 2.5 × 105 cells/well in a 24-well tissue culture plate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA), 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Macrophages were allowed to adhere for 2 h at 37 °C in a 10% CO2 humidified incubator at which time non-adherent cells were removed and macrophages were cultured for an additional 48 h before use in phagocytosis assays. Resident peritoneal (RP) MΦ were isolated from mice using 5 ml of sterile Hanks' balanced salt solution to lavage the peritoneum following euthanization with CO2. Resident peritoneal cells were collected, centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and plated at 4 × 105 cells/well and cultured as described for thioglycollate-elicited macrophages. Murine macrophage RAW264.7 cell line (from ATCC, Manassas, VA) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Cells were plated at 4 × 104 cells per well in a 24-well tissue culture plate for 48 h prior to phagocytosis assays. Induction of Sterile Peritonitis—Mice were injected intraperitoneal with 1 mg of zymosan (in 1 ml of PBS) and peritoneal cells were harvested by lavage with sterile Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with 1 mm EDTA and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2) at the times indicated. Cell counts and cytospins were done to determine cell differentials and absolute numbers. In some cases, peritoneal cells were separated into neutrophils and mononuclear cell fractions by Percoll density gradient centrifugation as described by Suratt et al. (22Suratt B.T. Young S.K. Lieber J. Nick J.A. Henson P.M. Worthen G.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L913-L921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peritoneal cells were suspended in 6 ml of PBS and peritoneal lavage fluid (6 ml) was subjected to lipid extraction as described below. To test the role of lyso-PS signaling via G2A during resolution of inflammation, mice were injected intraperitoneally (100 μg/mouse) with either goat IgG or anti-G2A antibody (dialyzed against PBS) 24 h post-zymosan injection. Peritoneal cells were collected by lavage at the times indicated. Total cells counts and differentials were determined as described above. Lipid Extraction and Derivatization—Lipids were extracted by the method of Folch et al. (23Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, peritoneal cells or human neutrophils (2-5 × 106/ml) in 6 ml of PBS, 6 ml of culture supernatant or peritoneal lavage fluid were extracted in a separatory funnel with CHCl3/MeOH/dH2O, 20:10:6 (v/v/v), supplemented with 70 mm NaCl. Fifty ng of 17:1/OH-PS, 1 μg of 19:0/OH-PC, and 1 μg of 14:0/OH-PE were added to each sample as internal standards and in some samples 10 μg of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine was also added. The extractions were allowed to sit overnight at room temperature. The organic layer was collected and brought to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. Reactive aldehyde or ketone groups were derivatized in the gas phase with MOX as described (24Zemski Berry K.A. Murphy R.C. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2005; 7: 157-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In brief, sodium hydroxide (1 ml) and MOX (50 mg) were added together and attached to an enclosed glass apparatus. During a 60-min incubation at 60 °C, the liberated CH3ONH2 gas derivatized the ketone or aldehyde groups present on the oxidized phospholipids. Following derivatization, the dried lipids were suspended in 200 μl of CHCl3 and applied to a hexane-conditioned aminopropyl Sep-Pak (NH2-SPE) column to separate lipids by class (25Kim H.Y. Salem Jr., N. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 2285-2289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Bodennec J. Pelled D. Futerman A.H. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 218-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The neutral lipids were eluted with 4 ml of CHCl3, isopropyl alcohol, 2:1 (v/v). Polar lipids (phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine) were collected with 4 ml of MeOH and the acidic lipids (phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid, and phosphatidylglycerol) were collected with 4 ml of MeOH, CHCl3, 3.6 m ammonium acetate, 60:30:8 (v/v/v). The acidic lipid fraction from the NH2-SPE, which contained PS was dried under nitrogen until 200 μl of liquid remained. An equal volume of MeOH was added to suspend the lipids and water was added to reduce the MeOH content to less than 10% of final volume. The ammonium acetate present in this NH2-SPE fraction was removed by introducing the acidic lipid fraction onto a MeOH-conditioned and rinsed HLB reverse phase column. Bound phospholipids were washed with 4-5 volumes of dH2O and eluted with 2 ml of MeOH/CHCl3, 2:1 (v/v), dried under a stream of nitrogen and suspended in 65 μl of reverse phase buffer A. During the course of phospholipid extraction using known quantities of a standard lyso-PS, it was determined that the recovery efficiency for lyso-PS species reached 50%. Reverse Phase Chromatography and Electrospray Ionization Tandem Mass Spectrometry—RP-HPLC/MS/MS analysis of PS present in the methanol, chloroform, 3.6 m ammonium acetate, 60:30:8 (v/v/v), elution of the NH2-SPE was performed using an Eclipse Plus 3.5 μmC18 (2.1 × 50 mm) column (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) with mass spectrometric detection using a Sciex API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE Sciex, Toronto, Canada). The HPLC was operated at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min with a mobile phase of methanol/acetonitrile/water, 60:20:20 (v/v/v), with 1 mm ammonium acetate (solvent A) and 1 mm methanolic ammonium acetate (solvent B). The gradient for the PS analysis was 0% solvent B to 100% solvent B in 20 min and then an isocratic hold at 100% B for 10 min. In some cases, the PS species were detected in the negative ion mode by monitoring for the neutral loss of serine (neutral loss of 87 atomic mass unit) with a collision energy of -30 V (27Pulfer M. Murphy R.C. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2003; 22: 332-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). The mass range scanned for neutral loss of the 87 atomic mass unit scan was m/z 400-900 at a rate of 3 s/scan. In other cases, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in the negative ion mode of m/z 508.5 → 421.5 for 17:1/OH-PS (internal standard), m/z 522.5 → 435.5 for 18:1/OH-PS, m/z 524.5 → 437.5 for 18:0/OH-PS, and m/z 707.6 → 620.5 for MOX derivatized 18:0/9al-PS was used to detect the major oxPS species eluting from the RP-HPLC column. In addition, minor oxPS species observed previously (16Arroyo A. Modriansky M. Serinkan F.B. Bello R.I. Matsura T. Jiang J. Tyurin V.A. Tyurina Y.Y. Fadeel B. Kagan V.E. J. Biol.

Med. 2006; 203: 2613-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) were monitored in the negative ion mode with their specific MRM transitions (see supplemental Table S1). For PS analysis in the negative ion mode, the electrospray voltage was -4000 V, the focusing potential was -200 V, and the declustering potential was -45 V. In addition PC and PE were also analyzed using the same chromatography conditions above and using a precursor of m/z 184 and neutral loss of 141 atomic mass units in the positive ion mode to specifically detect PC and PE lipids, respectively (27Pulfer M. Murphy R.C. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2003; 22: 332-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Quantitation—The quantitation of 18:1/OH-PS and 18:0/OH-PS in the samples was performed using a standard isotope dilution curve as previously described (28Hall L.M. Murphy R.C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The internal standard used for this quantitative analysis was 17:1/OH-PS. Because small amounts of lyso-PS were generated during the MOX derivatization process, quantitation of all lyso-PS was carried out on duplicate samples in the absence of MOX derivatization. Vesicle Preparation and Modification—1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), some containing either 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine or 1-oleoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (lyso-PS) (at the indicated molar ratios) at a final concentration of 100 mm were prepared by evaporating the lipid to dryness under nitrogen in a glass tube. Dried lipids were suspended in PBS or media without serum or protein supplementation by vigorous vortexing, and small unilamellar vesicles were created by sonication in a water bath sonicator (29Fadok V.A. Savill J.S. Haslett C. Bratton D.L. Doherty D.E. Campbell P.A. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 4029-4035PubMed Google Scholar). Small unilamellar vesicles were stored on ice and used within 1 h of preparation. For phagocytosis assays, 100 μl (100 nmol of total lipid) were used per well. For in vitro oxidation, 100 μg/ml synthetic 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine or 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine suspended in PBS was oxidized using the MPO/H2O2/NO2− generating system according to the methods of Greenburg et al. (18Greenberg M.E. Sun M. Zhang R. Febbraio M. Silverstein R. Hazen S.L. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2613-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Oxidation of lipids was also performed using 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine)-dihydrochloride (Sigma) at a final concentration of 10 mm at 37 °C for 2.5 h. To detect oxidized species containing reactive aldehydes or ketones, lipids were derivatized in the gas phase with MOX as stated above. Following derivatization, lipids were processed as stated above and suspended at 250 μg/ml in CHCl3/MeOH, 2:1. For LC/MS/MS, 5 μg of the lipid was dried under nitrogen and suspended in 65 μl of reverse phase buffer A. Surface G2A Staining—Murine resident or thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages or the RAW264.7 murine macrophage cell line were incubated with 5 μg/ml anti-G2A or isotype control for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed 2 times with ice-cold PBS and incubated with donkey anti-goat IgG Alexa 488 for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed 2 times with ice-cold PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry. Stimulation and Preparation of Neutrophils for Lipid Extraction and Engulfment Assays—Human neutrophils were obtained from normal, healthy donors in accordance with a protocol reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board. Using endotoxin-free reagents and plasticware, human neutrophils were isolated by the plasma Percoll method as described previously (30Haslett C. Guthrie L.A. Kopaniak M.M. Johnston Jr., R.B. Henson P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 101-110PubMed Google Scholar). For in vitro studies, human neutrophils were suspended at 5 × 106/ml in a HEPES buffer (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4)) supplemented with 0.05% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. For stimulation, zymosan was opsonized with pooled human serum as described previously (31Yamamori T. Inanami O. Sumimoto H. Akasaki T. Nagahata H. Kuwabara M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1571-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and added to neutrophils at a concentration of 200 μg/ml. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was used at a final concentration of 20 ng/ml and fMLP at 100 nm. Cells were stimulated for the times indicated at 37 °C and subjected to lipid extraction and LC/MS/MS analysis as described above. For phagocytosis assays, human neutrophils were stimulated with 20 ng/ml PMA for 30 min at 37 °C or UV irradiated for 5 min on a trans-illuminator followed by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. Surface PS exposure was detected by Annexin V binding and propidium iodide staining (as a test for permeability) and flow cytometry according to the manufacturers instructions. Under these conditions UV-irradiated neutrophils were greater than 50% apoptotic as determined by nuclear morphology and were 63.4 ± 5.8% Annexin V positive, and >97% propidium iodide negative as determined by flow cytometry. PMA-stimulated neutrophils were less than 5% apoptotic as determined by nuclear morphology and were 43.5 ± 6.5% Annexin V positive, and >96% propidium iodide negative as determined by flow cytometry. In some experiments human neutrophils were preincubated with liposomes according to the methods described by Fadok et al. (14Fadok V.A. de Cathelineau A. Daleke D.L. Henson P.M. Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1071-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, unstimulated viable neutrophils or neutrophils UV irradiated to induce apoptosis (as described above) were suspended at 2 × 107 cells/ml in PBS supplemented with 0.01% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin. An equal volume of liposomes containing the indicated lipids in PBS (as described above) was added to the cells at a final concentration of 1 μmol of total lipid per 1 × 107 cells (final concentration of 0.005% bovine serum albumin). Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and washed twice with PBS and used in phagocytosis assays as described below. Following stimulation or induction of apoptosis, neutrophils were washed once and suspended at 2 × 107 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum for use in the phagocytosis assays (see below). Where indicated, unstimulated viable neutrophils were opsonized with mouse anti-human CD45. Briefly, cells at 5 × 106/ml were incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-CD45 for 30 min at 4 °C. Binding of anti-CD45 was confirmed by incubating the cells with anti-mouse IgG Alexa 488 (1:100) for 30 min on ice and analysis by flow cytometry (data not shown). Anti-CD45-opsonized neutrophils were washed as stated above for use in phagocytosis assays. Where the phagocytic index (PI) is represented as percent of control, the PI for control resident peritoneal macrophages with UV-irradiated neutrophils was 20.1 ± 2.72, and with COOH beads was 44.4 ± 6.4. The PI for thioglycollate-elicited macrophages with UV neutrophils was 8.5 ± 1.7, and for RAW264.7 with COOH beads was 49.0 ± 4.5. Superoxide Measurement—Release of O2.¯ was determined by cytochrome c reduction as described previously (32Guthrie L.A. McPhail L.C. Henson P.M. Johnston Jr., R.B. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1656-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Phagocytosis Assays—Phagocytosis assays were performed as previously described (14Fadok V.A. de Cathelineau A. Daleke D.L. Henson P.M. Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1071-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). For antibody blocking experiments, 10 μg/ml anti-G2A or isotype control antibody was added for 30 min before liposomes or target cells were added. Liposomes (100 nmol in 100 μl) were added as indicted, either 1 h prior to or simultaneously with target cells. Target cells (either 2 × 106 UV-irradiated or PMA-stimulated neutrophils) or 2.5 × 105 COOH 5-μm beads in 100 μl were added per well. The macrophages/target cells were cocultured for 60 min at 37 °C in 10% CO2, washed three times with PBS, and stained with a modified Wright Giemsa stain (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). The phagocytic index (PI) was calculated by multiplying the percentage of MΦ that have phagocytosed by the average number of engulfed cells per MΦ (13Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J. Bratton D.L. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A minimum of 200 mΦ were counted blindly. Each condition was tested in duplicate using at least four mice per experiment and repeated 3-10 times as indicated. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses and p value calculations were conducted using analysis of variance (JMP statistical program (SAS Institute, Cary, NC)). The Dunnett and Tukey-Kramer tests were used for single and multiple comparisons, respectively. Lyso-PS Are Abundant Modified PS Species Produced in Neutrophils following Act"
https://openalex.org/W2064632433,"To efficiently generate cardiomyocytes from embryonic stem (ES) cells in culture it is essential to identify key regulators of the cardiac lineage and to develop methods to control them. Using a tet-inducible mouse ES cell line to enforce expression of a constitutively activated form of the Notch 4 receptor, we show that signaling through the Notch pathway can efficiently respecify hemangioblasts to a cardiac fate, resulting in the generation of populations consisting of >60% cardiomyocytes. Microarray analyses reveal that this respecification is mediated in part through the coordinated regulation of the BMP and Wnt pathways by Notch signaling. Together, these findings have uncovered a potential role for the Notch pathway in cardiac development and provide an approach for generating large numbers of cardiac progenitors from ES cells."
https://openalex.org/W2128146121,"Developmental genes are silenced in embryonic stem cells by a bivalent histone-based chromatin mark. It has been proposed that this mark also confers a predisposition to aberrant DNA promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in cancer. We report here that silencing of a significant proportion of these TSGs in human embryonic and adult stem cells is associated with promoter DNA hypermethylation. Our results indicate a role for DNA methylation in the control of gene expression in human stem cells and suggest that, for genes repressed by promoter hypermethylation in stem cells in vivo, the aberrant process in cancer could be understood as a defect in establishing an unmethylated promoter during differentiation, rather than as an anomalous process of de novo hypermethylation."

Conventional AKAPs contain a 14-18-amino acid sequence that forms an amphipathic helix that binds with high affinity to the regulatory (R) subunit of PKA type II. More recently, a group of dual specificity AKAPs has been classified on the basis of their ability to bind the PKA type I and the PKA type II isozymes. In this study we show that dual specificity AKAPs contain an additional PKA binding determinant called the RI Specifier Region (RISR). A variety of protein interaction assays and immunoprecipitation and immunolocalization experiments indicates that the RISR augments RI binding in vitro and inside cells. Cellular delivery of the RISR peptide uncouples RI anchoring to Ezrin leading to release of T cell inhibition by cAMP. Likewise, expression of mutant Ezrin forms where RI binding has been abrogated by substitution of the RISR sequence prevents cAMP-mediated inhibition of T cell function. Thus, we propose that the RISR acts in synergy with the amphipathic helix in dual specificity anchoring proteins to enhance anchoring of PKA type I.

The second messenger cAMP is frequently utilized in mammalian cells to regulate a variety of physiological processes. Cyclic AMP is generated at the plasma membrane in response to the occupancy of G-protein-coupled receptors. This ultimately leads to the stimulation of adenylyl cyclases, the enzymes that produce cAMP. The newly synthesized cAMP diffuses into the cell where it is available to activate a variety of effector proteins. These include protein kinase A (PKA) 4The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; AKAP, A-kinase anchoring protein; RISR, RI specifier region; TFE, trifluoroethanol; RIAD, RI anchoring disrupter; Csk, C-terminal Scr kinase; Lck, lymphocyte-specific protein-tyrosine kinase; EBP50, Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PAG, phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains; HEK, human embryonic kidney; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; Ab, antibody; TCR, T cell receptor; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus.

These proteins have distinct physical properties and affinities for cAMP (1Tasken K. Aandahl E.M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 137-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Because PKA is a broad specificity serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates a wide range of cellular processes, additional mechanisms have evolved to influence the selectivity of PKA action (7Wong W. Scott J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Specificity in PKA action is maintained in part by interaction with protein kinase A anchoring proteins (AKAPs). This family of structurally diverse but functionally related scaffolding proteins targets PKA and other signaling proteins toward distinct substrates. These protein-protein targeting interactions contribute to spatial and temporal regulation of second messenger signaling events (reviewed in Refs. 7Wong W. Scott J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 8Jarnaess E. Tasken K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The AKAP family now includes more than 50 members when including splice variants (7Wong W. Scott J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 959-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 8Jarnaess E. Tasken K. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 931-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although most of the AKAPs were initially identified on the basis of their ability to bind PKA type II inside cells, it is now recognized that several of these anchoring proteins such as D-AKAP1, D-AKAP2, AKAP220, Ezrin, Merlin, and PAP7 have a dual specificity as they also bind PKA type I (9Gronholm M.

Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V.M.

Trans. 1996; 24: 986-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This region inserts into a hydrophobic groove formed by the R dimer (22Newlon M.G. Roy M. Morikis D. Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1651-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The RII subunits dimerize at the N terminus in an antiparallel fashion forming an X-type four-helix bundle that is necessary for AKAP binding. RI contains a structurally similar docking and dimerization domain (20Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V.M. Hastings C.A. Reimann E.M. Scott J.D. J. Biol.

However, additional residues at the extreme N terminus in RI are believed to fold back onto a putative four-helix bundle and might contribute additional binding determinants for the RI dimer (29Leon D.A. Herberg F.W. Banky P. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28431-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Peptides patterned on the conserved amphipathic helix are effective inhibitors of PKA anchoring inside cells. As a result they are very useful tools to assess the role of anchored PKA in the control of cAMP-responsive events. The Ht31 peptide, derived from AKAP-Lbc, is considered to be the prototypic anchoring disrupter peptide (30Carr D.W. Hausken Z.E. Fraser I.D. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13376-13382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Diviani D. Soderling J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44247-44257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). A more potent dual-specific anchoring disrupter peptide called AKAP-IS was designed by bioinformatics (32Alto N.M. Soderling S.H. Hoshi N. Langeberg L.K. Fayos R. Jennings P.A. Scott J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4445-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In 2006, the crystal structure of AKAP-IS in complex with the docking and dimerization domain of RIIα was solved (26Gold M.G. Lygren B. Dokurno P. Hoshi N. McConnachie G. Tasken K. Carlson C.R. Scott J.D. Barford D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 383-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We took advantage of this information to develop a high affinity and RII isoform-specific anchoring disrupter peptide called SuperAKAP-IS. Similar technologies were used to generate an RI-selective anchoring disrupter peptide termed RIAD (33Carlson C.R. Lygren B. Berge T. Hoshi N. Wong W. Tasken K. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21535-21545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Both reagents can selectively be used as tools to delineate functional roles for the anchored PKA type I and anchored PKA type II isozymes inside cells. However, other mechanisms that do not involve the amphipathic helix may also serve to anchor PKA. For example, pericentrin binds to the regulatory subunits of PKA (type II) through a binding domain of 100 amino acids (34Diviani D. Langeberg L.K. Doxsey S.J. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 417-420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), whereas α4 integrins interact directly with the intact PKA (type I) holoenzyme via its cytoplasmic tail (17Lim C.J. Han J. Yousefi N. Ma Y. Amieux P.S. McKnight G.S. Taylor S.S. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, none of these AKAPs contain the conserved amphipathic α-helix. In T cells, PKA type I phosphorylation of serine 364 in the C-terminal Src kinase (Csk) activates the enzyme to block T cell activation (35Vang T. Torgersen K.M. Sundvold V. Saxena M. Levy F.O. Skalhegg B.S. Hansson V. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This proceeds through a mechanism that involves Csk-mediated suppression of the tyrosine kinase Lck. PKA type I is found at lipid rafts in resting T cells as well as in the soluble fraction (35Vang T. Torgersen K.M. Sundvold V. Saxena M. Levy F.O. Skalhegg B.S. Hansson V. Mustelin T. Tasken K. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Activation of the T cells involves a rapid polarization of the cell and the redistribution of PKA type I (36Skalhegg B.S. Tasken K. Hansson V. Huitfeldt H.S. Jahnsen T. Lea T. Science. 1994; 263: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the dual-specific AKAP Ezrin targets PKA type I to the immunological synapses during these events (37Ruppelt A. Mosenden R. Gronholm M. Aandahl E.M. Tobin D. Carlson C.R. Abrahamsen H. Herberg F.W. Carpen O. Tasken K. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 5159-5168Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition to binding PKA, Ezrin also associates with EBP50, a linker protein that contacts Csk-binding protein (Cbp)/phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid-enriched microdomains (PAG). Thus, Ezrin, EBP50, and Cbp/PAG form a scaffold that assembles the negatively regulatory cAMP-PKA type I-Csk pathway in T cell lipid rafts (37Ruppelt A. Mosenden R. Gronholm M. Aandahl E.M. Tobin D. Carlson C.R. Abrahamsen H. Herberg F.W. Carpen O. Tasken K. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 5159-5168Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In this study we document a comparison of Ezrin to other R-selective AKAPs and identify an additional region outside the amphipathic helix that facilitates RI binding. Bioinformatic analyses suggest that such regions are present in a majority of dual specificity AKAPs. We have called this region the RI Specifier Region (RISR). In vitro binding studies show that the RISR is important for Ezrin interaction with RI. Cell-based experiments suggest that mutations in the RISR of Ezrin that perturb RI anchoring alter the suppression of T cell signaling through a cAMP-PKA type I-Csk pathway. Sequence Analysis—The amino acid sequences of the dual specificity AKAPs Ezrin (NP_003370), Merlin (NP_000259), PAP7 (NP_073572), D-AKAP1 (CAA66000), and D-AKAP2 (O88845) were aligned using the multiple sequence alignment feature of the DNAstar Lasergene® software. MEME software was used for consensus sequence generation (38Bailey T.L. Elkan C. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1994; 2: 28-36PubMed Google Scholar). MEME settings included one motif per sequence, and a motif length of 24 amino acids was specified. Cell Cultures—Jurkat cells expressing the SV40 large T antigen (Jurkat TAg) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 1 mm pyruvate, and 1× nonessential amino acids (complete medium). HEK293 and HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (complete medium). Human peripheral blood was obtained from healthy donors (Ullevaal University Hospital Blood Centre, Oslo, Norway), and primary T cells were purified by negative selection as described previously (39Aandahl E.M. Aukrust P. Skalhegg B.S. Muller F. Froland S.S. Hansson V. Tasken K. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Briefly, leukocytes were separated from peripheral blood mononuclear cell using gradient centrifugation (Lymphoprep; Axis-shield PoC AS). T cells were isolated from the resulting cell suspension by negative selection using magnetic beads coated with anti-CD14 and anti-CD19 (Dynal AS, Invitrogen). All cells were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Constructs—MEMEcons (QEALQREEESKRRQEEAEQR) and MEMEcons* (QEALQREEESKRRQERQSSA) sequences were cloned via TOPO cloning technology (Invitrogen) and thereafter into the EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech). Bovine RIαΔ1-37, RIαΔ1-42, RIαΔ1-52, and RIαΔ1-59 mutants were cloned into pRSET-B. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Immunoprecipitation—HEK293 cells at 50-80% confluency were transfected with 5-10 μg of plasmid DNA per 10-cm dish using Lipofectamine™ (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini EDTA-free tablets; Roche Diagnostics). Immunoprecipitations were carried out using antibodies against PKA RIα (BD Transduction Laboratories). Immunocomplexes were washed three times in lysis buffer containing 0.1-1% Triton X-100 before SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the indicated antibody (Ab). siRNA Duplexes and siRNA-insensitive Constructs—The 21-nucleotide siRNA duplex targeting human Ezrin mRNA (Ez799, 5′-cccuuggacugaauauuuaug-3′;5′-uaaauauucaguccaagggca-3′) and a triple G/C-mutated control (Ez799M3, 5′-cgcuucgagugaauauuuaug-3′;5′-uaaauauucacucgaagcgca-3′) have been described previously (37Ruppelt A. Mosenden R. Gronholm M. Aandahl E.M. Tobin D. Carlson C.R. Abrahamsen H. Herberg F.W. Carpen O. Tasken K. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 5159-5168Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and were synthesized in-house. Ezrin clones insensitive to siRNA Ez799 were generated by introducing three nucleotide switches, C798G, T781G, and G787C (upper primer GCTTGGAGTTGATGCGCTGGGACTCAATATTTATGAGAAAGATGA; lower primer TCATCTTTCTCATAAATATTGAGTCCCAGCGCATCAACTCCAAGC) to avoid recognition by siRNA Ez799 in coexpression experiments. Protein Expression and Purification—Bovine RIα (full-length and deletion mutants) and murine RIIα protein were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction (4 h) and purified on cAMP-agarose beads. Human RIα was affinity-purified and subsequently biotinylated as described previously (40Stokka A.J. Gesellchen F. Carlson C.R. Scott J.D. Herberg F.W. Tasken K. Biochem. J. 2006; 400: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of GST-D-AKAP1 were as described earlier (40Stokka A.J. Gesellchen F. Carlson C.R. Scott J.D. Herberg F.W. Tasken K. Biochem. J. 2006; 400: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 41Herberg F.W. Maleszka A. Eide T. Vossebein L. Tasken K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Truncated (278-474 and 278-404) Ezrin wild type, R389A-, or K359A/K360A/R389A-substituted protein fused to GST were expressed in E. coli BL21 cells, induced using 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Sigma). Peptide Synthesis—Peptides used for ligand proximity assay (AlphaScreen) and IL-2 assays were synthesized on an Intavis MultiPep robot (Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments AG) and verified by high performance liquid chromatography. Peptides sequences were as follows: RIAD (LEQYANQLADQIIKEATE), RISR (ESKRRQEEAEQRK), RISR-RIAD (ESKRRQEEAEQRKLEQYANQLADQIIKEATE), RISR-Ht31 (ESKRRQEEAEQRKLIEEAASRIVDAVIEQV), RISR(Q6P/R12P)-Ht31 (ESKRRPEEAEQPKLIEEAASRIVDAVIEQV), Ht31 (LIEEAASRIVDAVIEQV), Arg9-RISR (RRRRRRRRRESKRRQEEAEQRK), and Arg9-RISR(Q6P/R12P) (RRRRRRRRRESKRRPEEAEQPK). Autospot Peptide Array—Peptide spots were synthesized with Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) protection chemistry on cellulose membranes using a Multipep automated peptide synthesizer (Intavis Bioanalytical Instruments AG) as described (42Frank R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 267: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). AlphaScreen Assay—For characterization of biomolecular interactions using AlphaScreen (amplified luminescence proximity homogeneous assay), biotinylated RIα and GST-D-AKAP1 were conjugated to streptavidin-coated donor beads and anti-GST-coated acceptor beads (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), respectively. The assay was carried out in the dark using 384-well white opaque plates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (40Stokka A.J. Gesellchen F. Carlson C.R. Scott J.D. Herberg F.W. Tasken K. Biochem. J. 2006; 400: 493-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 nm GST-D-AKAP1 was incubated with 20 nm biotinylated RIα in the presence of different concentrations of peptide for 15 min on ice in a total of 15 μl of assay buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% BSA). Five μl of acceptor beads were added and incubated on ice for 30 min. Subsequently, 5 μl of donor beads were added and incubated at room temperature for 90 min before reading on an EnVision™ multiplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Both bead types were added at 20 μg/ml final concentration. IC50 values were estimated by nonlinear regression analysis using SigmaPlot (SPSS Inc.). R Overlay—R overlays were conducted as described (19Carr D.W. Stofko-Hahn R.E. Fraser I.D. Bishop S.M. Acott T.S. Brennan R.G. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14188-14192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using 32P-labeled recombinant murine RIIα (43Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V.M. Scott J.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 88: 47-64PubMed Google Scholar) or recombinant bovine RIα (A98S), substituted to allow autophosphorylation (44Durgerian S. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9807-9813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the membrane with immobilized peptide or protein was blocked in Blotto (5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk and 0.1% BSA in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)). Purified recombinant R (4 μg) was radiolabeled with purified catalytic subunit (C) of PKA (0.02 μg/μl) and [γ-32P]ATP (1.4 μCi μl-1) in 50 mm MOPS, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.8, and separated from free [32P]ATP by gel filtration (G-50-Sepharose). Specific activity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting (1600TR Tri-Carb, Packard Instrument Co.). All overlays were performed overnight at room temperature using 1 × 106 cpm/ml TBS, 0.01% Tween 20 (TBS-T). For competition assays, soluble peptide was added to the radiolabeled RIα and incubated for 2 h before the spotted peptides were added. The membranes were washed five times in TBS-T, and the signal was detected by autoradiography. Solid Phase Pulldown—Lysate from 40 × 106 Jurkat TAg cells was incubated overnight at 4 °C with RISR or RISR(R12P) peptide synthesized in triplicate on cellulose membrane. The membranes were subsequently washed twice (20 min) in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaPPi, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4) with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, EDTA-free tablets, Roche Applied Science) and twice in high salt lysis buffer (1 m NaCl). PKA R subunit bound to the spotted peptides were eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using mouse anti-RIα and mouse anti-RIIα (BD Transduction Laboratories). Deletional Mapping of RISR Binding Area in RI—RISR peptides synthesized in triplicate on membranes were incubated with equal amounts of different N-terminally truncated RIα proteins (25 nm) in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, EDTA-free tablets, Roche Diagnostics). Assays were performed as described above, and binding was determined using mouse anti-RIα (BD Transduction Laboratories). GST Pulldown—Purified GST or GST-Ezrin fragments and RIα subunit were incubated at a 1:1 ratio (100 nm each) in 100 μl of pulldown buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with protease inhibitors (Complete Mini, EDTA-free tablets, Roche Diagnostics) for 30 min at 4 °C. Fifty μl of 50% glutathione-Sepharose slurry (Sigma) equilibrated in binding buffer were added to the proteins and incubated with rotation for 2 h at 4 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were subsequently washed three times with 500 μl of binding buffer and bound proteins eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using mouse-anti-RIα (BD Transduction Laboratories) and anti-GST horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences). Circular Dichroism—CD spectra of 24-mer peptides were obtained in the presence of 0-50% (v/v) trifluoroethanol (TFE) at 20 °C using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco International Co., Ltd.) as described previously (45Birkemo G.A. Mantzilas D. Luders T. Nes I.F. Nissen-Meyer J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1699: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Each sample was scanned five times at 20 nm/min (bandwidth 1 nm, and response time 1 s), over a 190-260 nm wavelength range. Transfection of Peripheral Blood T Cells, Peptide Loading, and Stimulation—Purified T cells were either transfected with 1 μg of DNA and 500 nm siRNA according to the manufacturer's instructions using the human T cell nucleofector kit (Amaxa Biosystems) and incubated for 48 h in complete medium or loaded with 25 μm Arg9-RISR peptides for 2-3 h before stimulation. A total of 2 × 105 cells was subsequently incubated for 15 min with or without 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP, at different concentrations and thereafter stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28-coated beads (1.6 beads/cell) (Dynabeads® CD3/CD28 T cell expander) for 16 h. Supernatants were harvested and IL-2 levels determined by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (R & D Systems). Immunofluorescence Analysis—For immunofluorescence analysis, transfected T cells were washed in PBS and settled for 30 min on poly(l-lysine)-coated coverslips (Sigma). Transfected HEK293T cells were grown on coverslips for 48 h. At room temperature, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Nonidet P-40/PBS for 5 min, and then blocked for 30 min with 2% BSA, 0.01% Tween 20/PBS (PBST-BSA). Primary antibodies anti-VSV-G (1:100, Roche Diagnostics) or anti-human RIα clone 4D7 (1:250) in PBST-BSA were added for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG1, Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgG2a, and Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500), Molecular Probes) in PBST-BSA for 30 min before being mounted with glass coverslips using fluorescent mounting medium (DakoCytomation). Confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope with a Plan-Apochromat 63 × 1.4 oil differential interference contrast objective lens, using laser excitation at 488 and 546 nm. Pictures were obtained using sequential scanning, and the exposure settings and gain of laser were kept the same for each condition. Colocalization was determined using the freely available ImageJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov). Images were opened in ImageJ, and a membrane segment was manually outlined in each image for which colocalization was determined by defining “pixels containing red (Alexa 546) and green (Alexa 488)” AND “pixels containing red (Alexa 546) OR green (Alexa 488)” as Boolean variables and counting the number of pixels true for green and red divided by the number of pixels true for green or red using the Process/Image calculator tool of the software.

Here, we investigate the potential of quantum dots (QDs) as fluorescent nanoparticles for in vitro and in vivo imaging of DCs, and as a particle-based antigen-delivery system to enhance DC-mediated immune responses. We used confocal, two-photon, and electron microscopies to visualize QD uptake into DCs and compared CD69 expression, T cell proliferation, and IFN-gamma production by DO11.10 and OT-II T cells in vivo in response to free antigen or antigen-conjugated to QDs. CD11c(+) DCs avidly and preferentially endocytosed QDs, initially into small vesicles near the plasma membrane by an actin-dependent mechanism. Within 10 min DCs contained vesicles of varying size, motion, and brightness distributed throughout the cytoplasm. At later times, endocytosed QDs were compartmentalized inside lysosomes. LPS-induced maturation of DCs reduced the rate of endocytosis and the proportion of cells taking up QDs. Following subcutaneous injection of QDs in an adjuvant depot, DCs that had endocytosed QDs were visualized up to 400 microm deep within draining lymph nodes. When antigen-conjugated QDs were used, T cells formed stable clusters in contact with DCs. Antigen-conjugated QDs induced CD69 expression, T cell proliferation, and IFN-gamma production in vivo with greater efficiency than equivalent amounts of free antigen. These results establish QDs as a versatile platform for immunoimaging of dendritic cells and as an efficient nanoparticle-based antigen delivery system for priming an immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2004551617,"A unique feature of the cancer-causing mucosotropic human papillomaviruses (HPVs) is the ability of their E6 proteins to interact with a number of PDZ domain-containing cellular substrates, including the cell polarity regulators hDlg and hScrib. These interactions are essential for the ability of these viruses to induce malignant progression. Rhesus papillomaviruses (RhPV) are similar to their human counterparts in that they also cause anogenital malignancy in their host, the Rhesus Macaque. However, unlike HPV E6, the RhPV E6 has no PDZ-binding motif. We now show that such a motif is present on the RhPV E7 oncoprotein. This motif specifically confers PDZ-binding activity and directs the interaction of RhPV E7 with the cell polarity regulator Par3, which it targets for proteasome-mediated degradation. These results demonstrate an amazing evolutionary conservation of function between the RhPV and the HPV oncoproteins, where both target proteins of the same cell polarity control network, although through different components and pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2020819434,"Integrin-ligand interactions are regulated in a complex manner by divalent cations, and previous studies have identified ligand-competent, stimulatory, and inhibitory cation-binding sites. In collagen-binding integrins, such as α2β1, ligand recognition takes place exclusively at the α subunit I domain. However, activation of the αI domain depends on its interaction with a structurally similar domain in the β subunit known as the I-like or βI domain. The top face of the βI domain contains three cation-binding sites: the metal-ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS), the ADMIDAS (adjacent to MIDAS), and LIMBS (ligand-associated metal-binding site). The role of these sites in controlling ligand binding to the αI domain has yet to be elucidated. Mutation of the MIDAS or LIMBS completely blocked collagen binding to α2β1; in contrast mutation of the ADMIDAS reduced ligand recognition but this effect could be overcome by the activating monoclonal antibody TS2/16. Hence, the MIDAS and LIMBS appear to be essential for the interaction between αI and βI, whereas occupancy of the ADMIDAS has an allosteric effect on the conformation of βI. An activating mutation in the α2 I domain partially restored ligand binding to the MIDAS and LIMBS mutants. Analysis of the effects of Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ on ligand binding to these mutants showed that the MIDAS is a ligand-competent site through which Mn2+ stimulates ligand binding, whereas the LIMBS is a stimulatory Ca2+-binding site, occupancy of which increases the affinity of Mg2+ for the MIDAS.

The overall shape of an integrin is that of a large ligand-binding “head” on two long “legs” with flexible “knees.” Integrins can exist in low affinity (“inactive”) and high affinity (primed or “active”) states; the balance between these states is regulated by both local and global conformational changes. The inactive form of the receptor has been shown to be bent with a closed headpiece, whereas the fully active form appears to be extended with an open headpiece (5Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T.

Eighteen α subunits (α1-α11, αV, αIIb, αD, αE, αM, αL, and αX) and eight β subunits (β1–β8) have been identified in mammals. Two subfamilies can be identified depending on the presence or absence of an autonomous folding domain of ∼200 amino acids, the inserted or “I” domain in the α subunit (“αI”). 2The abbreviations used are: αI, α subunit I-domain (also known as αA); βI, β subunit I-domain (also known as βA); MIDAS, metal-ion dependent adhesion site; ADMIDAS, adjacent to MIDAS; LIMBS, ligand-associated metal-binding site; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FLα2, α2-(1–1129)-Fc construct; TRα2, α2-(1–806)-Fc construct; FLβ1, β1-(1–708)-Fc construct; TRβ1, β1-(1–455)-Fc construct; FLα2β1-Fc, recombinant soluble integrin heterodimer containing the complete extracellular domains of α2 and β1 subunits fused to the CH2 and CH3 domains (Fc region) of human IgGγ1; TRα2β1-Fc, recombinant soluble integrin heterodimer containing C-terminal-truncated α2 and β1 subunits fused to the CH2 and CH3 domains of human IgGγ1; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. 2The abbreviations used are: αI, α subunit I-domain (also known as αA); βI, β subunit I-domain (also known as βA); MIDAS, metal-ion dependent adhesion site; ADMIDAS, adjacent to MIDAS; LIMBS, ligand-associated metal-binding site; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FLα2, α2-(1–1129)-Fc construct; TRα2, α2-(1–806)-Fc construct; FLβ1, β1-(1–708)-Fc construct; TRβ1, β1-(1–455)-Fc construct; FLα2β1-Fc, recombinant soluble integrin heterodimer containing the complete extracellular domains of α2 and β1 subunits fused to the CH2 and CH3 domains (Fc region) of human IgGγ1; TRα2β1-Fc, recombinant soluble integrin heterodimer containing C-terminal-truncated α2 and β1 subunits fused to the CH2 and CH3 domains of human IgGγ1; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary. The I domain comprises a central hydrophobic six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by seven α-helices, with the characteristic divalent cation-binding sequence motif DXSXS forming part of the metal-ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) on the top face of the domain (7Whittaker C.A. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3369-3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). In each of the nine αI-containing integrins (α1, α2, α10, α11, αE, αD, αM, αL, and αX), the MIDAS is the key site for ligand binding (8Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J.

I domains can exist in closed (inactive) or open (active) conformations, dependent upon a downward movement of the C-terminal α7 helix and an inward motion of the α1 helix (10Shimaoka M. Xiao T.

A domain sharing the same overall fold as the αI domain is present in all β subunits (the I-like or “βI” domain); this domain forms a major part of the ligand binding pocket in integrins that lack αI (12Xiong J.-P.

Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) have revealed the basis for the absolute dependence on divalent cations for ligand binding: a ligand carboxyl group coordinates to the cation present at the MIDAS of βI. The liganded β3 crystal structures also revealed two additional cation-binding sites in βI, the “ADMIDAS” site (adjacent to the MIDAS) and the “LIMBS” (ligand-associated metal-binding site). The βI MIDAS cation shares coordination residues with both the ADMIDAS and LIMBS, hence the three sites form a metal ion cluster (15Chen J. Salas A. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of αIIbβ3 (14Xiao T. Takagi J. Coller B.S. Wang J.-H. Springer T.A. Nature. 2004; 432: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) also showed that the βI domain undergoes conformational shifts in its α1 and α7 helices that result in an outward swing of the underlying hybrid domain in the open (active) conformation of the ligand-binding integrin headpiece. Although ligand binding in integrins that contain the αI domain does not directly involve βI, the C-terminal connecting loop between αI and the β-propeller contains a critical glutamate residue, which is proposed to bind to the βI MIDAS (16Huth J.R. Olejniczak E.T. Mendoza R. Liang H. Harris E.A. Lupher Jr., M.L. Wilson A.E. Fesik S.W. Staunton D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Binding of this loop is proposed to pull downwards on the α7 helix of αI, holding it in an open (active) conformation (18Yang W. Shimaoka M. Salas A. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2906-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Hence, βI can potentially regulate ligand binding to αI. Through this mechanism, the binding of divalent cations or activating mAbs to the βI domain could stimulate ligand binding to αI (19Lu C. Ferzly M. Takagi J. Springer T.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5629-5637Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The affinity of all integrin-ligand interactions is differentially regulated by Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+. We have previously used the interaction between integrin α5β1 and fibronectin as a model system to identify and characterize cation-binding sites that can support or modulate ligand recognition (20Mould A.P. Akiyama S.K. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26270-26277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Our results showed that several classes of cation-binding sites exist. Occupancy of the first class by Mg2+ or Mn2+ is required for ligand binding (ligand-competent site). The second class is implicated in the allosteric inhibition of Mn2+-supported ligand binding by Ca2+ (inhibitory site). A third class of sites also binds Ca2+ and is involved in the stimulation of Mg2+-supported ligand binding by increasing the affinity of Mg2+ for the ligand-competent site (stimulatory site). We subsequently provided evidence that in α5β1 the ligand-competent site for both Mg2+ and Mn2+ is the MIDAS of the βI domain (21Mould A.P. Askari J.A. Barton S. Kline A.D. McEwan P.A. Craig S.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19800-19806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ADMIDAS was found to be a Ca2+-binding inhibitory site in α5β1 (22Mould A.P. Barton S.J. Askari J.A. Craig S.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51622-51629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although the LIMBS is a candidate for a Ca2+-binding stimulatory site, it was not possible to test this suggestion for α5β1 because mutation of this site led to a complete loss of ligand recognition (22Mould A.P.

Previous studies on α4β7 have delineated separate functions for each of three βI cation-binding sites in this integrin (15Chen J. Salas A. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 29Chen J.F. Takagi J. Xie C. Xiao T. Luo B.-H. Springer T.A. J. Biol.

However, it is unclear if these findings are broadly applicable, e.g. to β1 integrins or to integrins that contain an αI domain. To study the regulation of ligand binding by divalent ions in an αI-containing integrin, we expressed the collagen receptor α2β1 in a recombinant soluble form. To elucidate the roles of the MIDAS, ADMIDAS, and LIMBS we mutated critical residues for cation binding in the βI domain and tested for ligand binding ability and regulation by divalent cations in solid phase assays. In this system, an activating mutation in the α2 I domain was found to partially overcome the effect of LIMBS mutations, thereby allowing us to test whether the LIMBS is a stimulatory site. Our results demonstrate that the three sites have distinct roles in the regulation of collagen binding to the α2 I domain, and that the LIMBS is essential for the stimulation of Mg2+-supported ligand binding by Ca2+.

The plate was then incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Unbound ligand was removed and the wells washed three times with buffer A. Bound ligand was quantitated by addition of 1:500 dilution of ExtrAvidin peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) in buffer A for 20–30 min at room temperature (50 μl/well). Wells were then washed four times with buffer B, and color was developed using ABTS substrate (50 μl/well). Background binding of collagen to wells incubated with supernatant from mock-transfected cells was subtracted from all measurements. Measurements obtained were the mean ± S.D. of three replicate wells. In all assays comparing the binding of collagen to wild-type and mutant receptors, the level of ligand binding to mutant receptors was normalized relative to that of wild-type by measuring the binding of the anti-α2 mAb JA218 to a parallel set of three replicate wells for each receptor; this mAb only recognizes the heterodimeric state of the integrin; normalization factor = (JA218 binding to wild-type receptor - background binding/(JA218 binding to mutant receptor - background binding). Divalent Cation Regulation of Collagen Binding—96-Well plates were coated with goat anti-human Fc at a concentration of 2.6 μg/ml in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (50 μl/well) for 16 h. Wells were then blocked for 1–3 h with blocking buffer, and then washed three times with buffer B (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Buffer B was treated with Chelex beads (Bio-Rad) to remove any small contaminating amounts of endogenous Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions. Cell culture supernatants (50 μl/well) were added and the plate incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Wells were washed three times in buffer B and biotinylated collagen (0.5 μg/ml) in buffer B was added to the plate (50 μl/well) in the presence of varying concentrations of Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+, or varying concentrations of Ca2+ with Mg2+. The remainder of the assay was performed as described above. Divalent Cation Regulation of Collagen Binding to α2 I Domain—96-Well plates were coated with recombinant α2 I-domain-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein at a concentration of 10 μg/ml in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (50 μl/well) for 16 h. Wells were then blocked for 1–3 h with blocking buffer, and then washed three times with buffer B. Biotinylated collagen (0.5 μg/ml) in buffer B was added to the plate (50 μl/well) in the presence of varying concentrations of Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+, or varying concentrations of Ca2+ with Mg2+. The remainder of the assay was performed as described above. Calculation of Apparent Kd Values—Binding of biotinylated collagen I to wild-type of mutant integrin was measured using solid phase assays as described above, over a range of collagen concentrations (0.1–10 μg/ml). Apparent affinity (apparent Kd) of binding was estimated by non-linear regression analysis using SigmaPlot version 8 (Systat Software Inc.), assuming a single class of binding sites. Expression of Recombinant Soluble α2β1-Fc Integrins Produces Functional “Full-length” and Truncated Receptors—Recombinant integrins were produced in a CHO cell expression system by cloning the extracellular portions of α2 and β1 integrin cDNAs and replacing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains with modified Fc tags to favor heterodimerization (34Coe A.P.F.

Presta L.G. Carter P. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). The soluble α2β1-Fc comprising the full-length extracellular domains of α2 and β1 is referred to as FLα2β1-Fc. In addition, α2 was modified by deleting 326 amino acids from its C-terminal end. The truncated subunit contains the headpiece region of α2, i.e. the β-propeller, αI domain, and the thigh domain. A parallel truncation in the β1 subunit (34Coe A.P.F. Askari J.A. Kline A.D. Robinson M.K. Kirby H. Stephens P.E. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35854-35866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) contains the PSI, βI, and hybrid domains. These two truncated subunits form a “minimized” heterodimer referred to here as TRα2β1-Fc. To assess whether the soluble integrins retained the native fold, anti-human α2 and β1 integrin monoclonal antibodies were examined for their ability to bind to the recombinant proteins in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Table 1). Recombinant receptors were captured from CHO cell culture supernatants with anti-human Fc antibody onto microtiter plates and the binding of anti-integrin mAbs was evaluated. A panel of mAbs directed against α2 (12F1, JA218, Gi9, and P1E6) and β1 (4B4, 8E3, 12G10, and TS2/16) recognized the FL and the TRα2β1-Fc integrins to a similar extent as native α2β1 purified from HT-1080 cells (Table 1, panel A). The α2 mAbs directed against the αI domain (12F1, Gi9, and P1E6) did not recognize the α2 constructs when these were transfected in the absence of a β1 subunit (data not shown). Western blotting of supernatants confirmed that heterodimer formation had taken place (Fig. 1, A and B). Following confirmation of the correct protein folding and assembly, the soluble integrins were tested for collagen binding activity in solid phase assays (Fig. 2). The assays were performed in the presence either Mg2+ (Fig. 2A) or Mn2+ (Fig. 2B), using a concentration of the cation that supported maximal ligand binding. The FL and TRα2β1-Fc integrins bound collagen I to comparable extents in both Mg2+ and Mn2+, and specific collagen binding was cation-dependent as it was completely blocked by EDTA. In the presence of TS2/16, a stimulatory mAb that binds to the βI domain, collagen binding was unchanged for FLα2β1 and only slightly increased for the TRα2β1-Fc integrin. Hence, both FL and TRα2β1-Fc appear to be almost completely in an active form.TABLE 1Summary of mAb reactivity with α2β1 integrin variants CHO L761h cells were transfected with α2-(1–1129)-Fc (FLα2), or α2-(1–806)-Fc (TRα2), and β1-(1–708)-Fc (FLβ1), wild-type β1-(1–455)-Fc (TRβ1) or mutated TRβ1 constructs (A), or TRα2 with I332G mutation (TRα2[I332G]) and wild-type or mutated TRβ1 constructs (B). Recombinant receptors were captured from cell culture supernatants with goat anti-human Fc antibody onto microtiter plates and analysed for reactivity with 5 μg/ml anti-α2 mAbs (JA218, 12F1, P1E6, or Gi9), or anti-β1 mAbs (12G10, TS2/16, 8E3, 4B4, 15/7, or HUTS-4) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results are expressed as a percentage of the binding of the anti-α2 mAb JA218 (set at 100%) and are normalised to the binding of JA218 to wild type TRα2b1-Fc.

https://openalex.org/W1972645105,"Two novel mutations (G159D and L29Q) in cardiac troponin C (CTnC) associate their phenotypic outcomes with dilated (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), respectively. Current paradigms propose that sarcomeric mutations associated with DCM decrease the myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity, whereas those associated with HCM increase it. Therefore, we incorporated the mutant CTnCs into skinned cardiac muscle in order to determine if their effects on the Ca2+ sensitivities of tension and ATPase activity coincide with the current paradigms and phenotypic outcomes. The G159D-CTnC decreases the Ca2+ sensitivity of tension and ATPase activation and reduces the maximal ATPase activity when incorporated into regulated actomyosin filaments. Under the same conditions, the L29Q-CTnC has no effect. Surprisingly, changes in the apparent G159D-CTnC Ca2+ affinity measured by tension in fibers do not occur in the isolated CTnC, and large changes measured in the isolated L29Q-CTnC do not manifest in the fiber. These counterintuitive findings are justified through a transition in Ca2+ affinity occurring at the level of cardiac troponin and higher, implying that the true effects of these mutations become apparent as the hierarchical level of the myofilament increases. Therefore, the contractile apparatus, representing a large cooperative machine, can provide the potential for a change (G159D) or no change (L29Q) in the Ca2+ regulation of contraction. In accordance with the clinical outcomes and current paradigms, the desensitization of myofilaments from G159D-CTnC is expected to weaken the contractile force of the myocardium, whereas the lack of myofilament changes from L29Q-CTnC may preserve diastolic and systolic function.

Cardiomyopathies are diseases of the myocardium that often lead to cardiac remodeling to compensate for deficiencies in cardiac output (1Fatkin D. Graham R.M. Physiol.

Topol E.J. Manual of Cardiovascular Medicine. 2nd Ed. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia2004: 101-142Google Scholar). In many cases, the cardiac contractile dysfunction is attributed to inherited sarcomeric gene mutations. The functional effects of more than 40 thin filament mutations associated with cardiomyopathies assessed in vitro suggest that these mutations affect the Ca2+ responsiveness of the myofilament in the absence of CTnI phosphorylation. As the number of in vitro-characterized mutations continues to grow, a developing paradigm emerges that associates decreases in the myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity with DCM (3Du C.K. Morimoto S.

This suggests that distinct effects on the Ca2+-dependent processes of the myofilament are critical determinants of the severity and molecular pathologies of these diseases. The first cardiac troponin C (CTnC) mutation (E59D/D75Y) was found in an explanted heart from an adult male who died from idiopathic DCM (18Liao R. Gwathmey J.K. Wang C. Circulation. 1998; 98: I-625Google Scholar); the second mutation (L29Q) was found in a living 60-year-old male diagnosed with HCM, despite having preserved diastolic and systolic function (19Hoffmann B. Schmidt-Traub H. Perrot A. Osterziel K.J. Gessner R. Hum. Mutat. 2001; 17: 524Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); and the third (G159D) was found by linkage analysis and cosegregation studies in more than three affected families with DCM (20Mogensen J. Murphy R.T. Shaw T. Bahl A. Redwood C. Watkins H. Burke M. Elliott P.M. McKenna W.J. J. Am Coll. Cardiol. 2004; 44: 2033-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 21Kaski J.P. Burch M. Elliott P.M. Cardiol. Young. 2007; 17: 675-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The lack of affected relatives and cosegregation studies associated with the L29Q and E59D/D75Y CTnC mutations may or may not confirm these mutations as etiological causes for the diseases; therefore, the functional and biochemical effects of these mutations must be studied in order to predict the physiological consequences of these mutations. As such, our investigations will relate the changes in apparent CTnC Ca2+ affinity to the myofilament response and determine if these mutations coincide with the developing paradigm. The effects of the E59D/D75Y mutation were previously reported to coincide with the aforementioned paradigms (18Liao R. Gwathmey J.K. Wang C. Circulation. 1998; 98: I-625Google Scholar, 22Dweck D.

J. 2008; 94: 3577-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); therefore, this paper will focus on the L29Q and G159D CTnC mutations. Cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation is regulated by the intracellular Ca2+ concentration via the thin filament regulatory protein, CTnC. During systole, the rise in free calcium promotes Ca2+ binding to CTnC. This leads to the translocation of CTnI and tropomyosin (Tm) away from the outer domain of the actin filaments, allowing for subsequent cross-bridge interaction and the generation of tension. With the decline of Ca2+ during diastole, Ca2+ dissociates from CTnC, and the inhibitory actions of CTnI and Tm are restored (see Refs. 24Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar and 25Li M.X. Wang X. Sykes B.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2004; 25: 559-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar for a review). CTnC contains three metal ion binding sites: two C-terminal sites that bind Ca2+ and Mg2+ (“Ca2+-Mg2+ sites”) competitively (KCa = 1.4 × 107 m–1; (KCa=1.4×107M-1;KMg'}1.0×103M-1)) and one N-terminal, Ca2+-specific regulatory site (KCa = 2.5 × 105 m–1) that is responsible for transmitting the Ca2+ binding signal to the rest of the thin filament and switching on contraction (26Potter J.D. Gergely J. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4628-4633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Holroyde M.J. Robertson S.P. Johnson J.D. Solaro R.J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11688-11693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of the L29Q and G159D mutations are of particular interest, because previous studies show that the apparent CTnC Ca2+ affinity as measured by tension and ATPase activity is unaffected unless CTnI (Ser23/Ser24) is phosphorylated (28Preston L.C. Ashley C.C. Redwood C.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 360: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 29Biesiadecki B.J. Kobayashi T. Walker J.S. Solaro R.J. de Tombe P.P. Circ.

These studies identified a blunted protein kinase A-phosphorylated response as an underlying molecular pathology for these mutations. However, these findings represent challenges to the developing paradigm, because in the presence of phosphorylated CTnI, the myofilament Ca2+ sensitivities are similarly affected for both mutations yet lead to different effects on the structural opening of the CTnC N-lobe (31Dong W.J. Xing J. Ouyang Y. An J. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3424-3432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and phenotypic outcomes (19Hoffmann B. Schmidt-Traub H.

In addition, the clinical data from the only L29Q proband results in a seemingly benign phenotype (19Hoffmann B. Schmidt-Traub H. Perrot A. Osterziel K.J. Gessner R. Hum. Mutat. 2001; 17: 524Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); however, subsequent in vitro studies have shown that in the absence of phosphorylated CTnI, the L29Q mutation can decrease (30Schmidtmann A. Lindow C. Villard S. Heuser A. Mugge A. Gessner R. Granier C. Jaquet K. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 6087-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), increase (32Liang B. Chung F. Qu Y. Pavlov D.

Our results show that in the absence of phosphorylated CTnI, skinned cardiac muscle preparations reconstituted with L29Q CTnC are all unaffected, possibly explaining the benign phenotypic outcome observed from this mutation. In contrast, the G159D mutation significantly decreases the Ca2+ sensitivities of tension and cardiac myofibrillar ATPase activation, coinciding with the effects of other DCM-associated thin filament mutations (6Chang A.N.

Surprisingly, the isolated G159D CTnC structure and apparent regulatory site Ca2+ affinity (as measured by IAANS fluorescence) are seemingly unaffected, whereas the structure and Ca2+ affinity of L29Q CTnC are significantly altered. The disparity of measurements between the isolated CTnC and skinned muscle have led us to pursue the key intermolecular interactions that dictate the final Ca2+ sensitivity of tension in the muscle fiber. Our results show that at the level of CTn, the G159D CTnC structure and Ca2+ affinity deviates from the WT, whereas the L29Q CTnC structure and Ca2+ affinity begin to converge with the WT. Therefore, the contractile apparatus, representing a large cooperative machine, can provide the potential for a change (G159D) or no change (L29Q) in the myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity if any of the proteins are mutated. Finally, our results show that the changes in myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity arising from these mutations do coincide with the developing paradigms and are indicative of the phenotypic outcomes. Mutation, Expression, and Purification of CTnC—The CTnC sequence was derived from a human cardiac cDNA library and subcloned into the pET3-d vector with its sequence verified. Human CTnC mutants were generated by following Stratagene's guidelines for using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. All mutant CTnCs were sequenced to verify the correct sequences prior to expression and purification. Standard methods previously used in this laboratory were utilized for expression and purification of the different CTnC mutants (37Szczesna D. Guzman G. Miller T. Zhao J. Farokhi K. Ellemberger H. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8381-8386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Labeling of CTnC—Monocysteine CTnC derivatives were engineered using cDNAs previously cloned for G159D, L29Q, and WT CTnC by substituting Cys35 for Ser in order to direct specific IAANS incorporation to Cys84 (denoted -CTnC(C84)IA). The CTnCs were also doubly labeled with IAANS at Cys35 and Cys84 (denoted -CTnCIA). Fluorescent incorporation and subsequent purification of labeled CTnC followed previous methods (38Putkey J.A. Liu W. Lin X. Ahmed S. Zhang M. Potter J.D. Kerrick W.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 970-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Purification of Tropomyosin—Porcine cardiac Tm was purified from the ammonium sulfate precipitate obtained in the course of native cardiac troponin subunit preparations (39Potter J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Briefly, the Tm was purified by isoelectric precipitation followed by ion exchange chromatography (Q-Sepharose). Purified Tm was dialyzed against 5 mm NH4(CO3)2, lyophilized, and stored at –20 °C. Formation of Cardiac Troponin Complexes—cDNAs cloned in our laboratory from human cardiac tissue were used for the expression and purification of CTnI (40Zhang R. Zhao J. Potter J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30773-30780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and CTnT (39Potter J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Formation of fluorescent binary and ternary complexes and non-labeled ternary complexes was carried out using recently established protocols (37Szczesna D. Guzman G. Miller T. Zhao J. Farokhi K.

Preparation of IAANS-labeled Regulated Thin Filaments—Regulatory complexes (actin-Tm-CTn) were prepared by mixing F-actin isolated from rabbit skeletal acetone powder (42Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85: 164-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar) and Tm in a 7:1 molar ratio in a solution containing 60 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, pH 7.0, on ice. The final concentration of actin was ∼0.8 mg/ml. After homogenization in a glass homogenizer, the F-actin-tropomyosin complex was combined with preformed IAANS-labeled CTn complex (tropomyosin/CTn = 1 mol/mol) in a solution containing 100 mm MOPS, 75 mm KCl, 1.25 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 4 mm nitrilotriacetic acid (standard buffer conditions for our fluorometric titrations). After homogenization, the mixture was allowed to sit at room temperature for 10 min. The homogenate was centrifuged for 1 h at 150,000 × g, and the pellet resuspended in standard fluorescence buffer. The solution was centrifuged and resuspended again in order to avoid free Tm-CTn and free CTn trapped in the pellet. Regulated thin filaments (RTFs) were filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and stored on ice ready to use for experiments. Determination of Apparent Ca2+ Affinities—Labeled proteins (isolated CTnC and binary and ternary complex) were dialyzed exhaustively in standard fluorescence buffer (see above). The isolated CTnCs were dialyzed in the absence of Mg2+ to prevent dimerization (43Jaquet K. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 145: 1390-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar); therefore, Mg2+ was added just before the titration with Ca2+. All solutions were prepared at 21 °C. Steady state fluorescence measurements were made with a Jasco 6500 spectrofluorimeter. IAANS fluorescence was excited at 330 nm, and emission was monitored at 450 nm as incremental amounts of CaCl2 were added to a 2.0-ml mixture containing labeled proteins. The final concentrations of isolated CTnC, binary complex, ternary complex, and RTFs in each experiment were 0.25 μm, 0.5 μm, 0.5 μm, and 0.053 mg/ml, respectively. The concentration of free Ca2+ was calculated for actual titration conditions using the computer program pCa Calculator (44Dweck D. Reyes-Alfonso Jr., A. Potter J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 347: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This program corrected for dilution effects attributed to the incremental addition of Ca2+. The data were fitted to the Hill equation with the software suite of SigmaPlot 10.0. The Ca2+ affinities are reported as pCa50 (–log[Ca2+] at which 50% of maximal response is observed) values ± S.D. The following modified Hill equation was used to fit biphasic binding curves, Y={S1·[Ca2+]n1/(Kd1n1+[Ca2+]n1)}+{S2·[Ca2+]n2/(Kd2n2+[Ca2+]n2)}(Eq. 1) where Y represents the fluorescence intensity, S1 and S2 are the percentage contributions of each class of site to the fluorescence, Kd1 and Kd2 are the macroscopic dissociation constants for both classes of sites, and n1 and n2 are the respective Hill coefficients. Reconstituted Myofilament ATPase Assays—Whole porcine cardiac myosin was isolated from left ventricles (45Murakami U. Uchida K. Hiratsuka T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1976; 80: 611-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); F-actin, tropomyosin, and recombinant human CTn were prepared as described above. The ATPase assays were performed in a 96-well flat bottom plate using 0.1-ml reaction volumes. Preformed human cardiac Tn complexes were added (≤20 μl) to the 96 wells to achieve concentrations ranging from 0.0 to 2.0 μm in the final reaction mixture. F-actin, myosin, and tropomyosin were homogenized on ice in a glass tube and allowed to come to room temperature before the addition to each well (≤20 μl). The final concentrations of F-actin, myosin, and Tm in each well were 3.5, 0.6, and 1.0 μm, respectively. Two different ATPase buffers were prepared to adjust the final concentrations of all salts for high (pCa 4) and low (pCa > 9) Ca2+ conditions. The remainder of the 0.1-ml reaction volume comprised 50 μl of high or low Ca2+ ATPase buffer, double-distilled H2O, and 4 μl of ATP (3.14 mm, pH 7) to initiate the ATPase reaction. Methods for solving the free and bound metal ion equilibria were provided for by the computer program pCa Calculator (44Dweck D. Reyes-Alfonso Jr., A. Potter J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 347: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The final reaction conditions contained 50 mm KCl, 1.0 mm free Mg2+, 2.5 mm MgATP2–, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm MOPS, 1 mm EGTA (in low Ca2+-ATPase buffer) or 0.23 mm CaCl2 (in high Ca2+-ATPase buffer), pH 7, at 25 °C. The ATPase reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP in a row-wise fashion and immediately mixed with a 12-channel pipettor 4–5 times and allowed to incubate at 25 °C for 20 min; thereafter, stopping the reaction by adding cold trichloroacetic acid (4.75% final concentration). Each row was activated and deactivated in 30-s intervals. After sedimenting the precipitate by centrifugation, the supernatants were transferred to a new plate, and the liberated inorganic phosphate concentration in the supernatant was determined according to the method of Fiske and Subbarow (46Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The ATPase rates were measured by single time points that were predetermined to be linear with time. Preparation of Skinned Cardiac Myofibrils—Porcine cardiac myofibrils (CMF) were isolated form porcine left ventricles, as described by Solaro et al. (47Solaro R.J. Pang D.C. Briggs F.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 245: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), substituting MOPS for imidazole. All CMF preparations were stored in 50% glycerol (v/v) at –20 °C. CDTA treatment of cardiac myofibrils were performed by the methods of Morimoto and Ohtsuki (48Morimoto S. Ohtsuki I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 101: 291-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with the following modifications; CTnC extraction occurred in 5.0 mm CDTA, 5.0 mm dithiothreitol, pH 8.4, adjusted with Tris-base (solid) for 15 min, followed by centrifugation. This procedure was repeated four more times using 30 min CDTA incubations. CDTA was removed by suspending the pellet in wash buffer containing 10.0 mm MOPS, 10.0 mm KCl, 0.5% glycerol at pH 7 followed by centrifugation. These washes were repeated two more times in the absence of glycerol. CTnC reconstitution was performed by mixing CDTA-treated myofibrils (1.5–3.0 mg/ml) in wash buffer with recombinant CTnC (∼13 μm final concentration) on ice for 30 min. Unbound CTnC was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was discarded. Pellets were resuspended in wash buffer (without glycerol). This wash cycle was repeated and the final precipitate resuspended in wash buffer (without glycerol), stored on ice, and used for experiments. Ca2+-activated Myofibrillar ATPase Assays—0.1-ml reaction mixtures were carried out in a 96-well plate. First, 50 μg (≤46-μl volume) of myofibrils in wash buffer (without glycerol) were aliquoted per well. The remainder of the 0.1-ml reaction volume comprised double-distilled H2O, ATPase buffers (50 μl) that have different amounts of calcium added to achieve the desired free calcium concentration, and 4 μl of ATP (3.14 mm, pH 7), which is added to initiate the ATPase reaction at 25 °C. The reactions were terminated 5 min later by the addition of trichloroacetic acid, and the inorganic phosphate was measured as above. Methods for solving the free and bound metal ion equilibria in our solutions were provided for by the computer program pCa Calculator (44Dweck D. Reyes-Alfonso Jr., A. Potter J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 347: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The final reaction condition contained 10–8.0 to 10–4.5 m free Ca2+, 1 mm free Mg2+, 2.5 mm Mg-ATP2–, 2 mm EGTA, 4 mm nitrilotriacetic acid, 20 mm MOPS, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 80 mm ionic strength (adjusted with KCl), pH 7, at 25 °C. The data were fitted to the Hill equation using the software suite of SigmaPlot 10.0. Skinned Fiber Preparations—Skinned fibers were prepared using established protocols (37Szczesna D. Guzman G.

Muscle fibers were isolated from porcine left ventricular papillary muscle; pCa solutions were generated using the pCa Calculator program (44Dweck D. Reyes-Alfonso Jr., A. Potter J.D. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 347: 303-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); and endogenous CTnC was extracted with 5 mm CDTA, pH 8.4 (adjusted with solid Tris-base) until the fibers developed <20% of the initial force (residual force) in pCa 4.0 solution. CDTA-treated fibers were reconstituted with CTnC (WT and mutant), and the Ca2+ dependence of force generation and maximal recovered force (in the pCa 4.0) was measured. Data were analyzed using the following equation, Change in force(%)=100×[Ca2+]n/([Ca2+]n+[Ca2+50]n)(Eq. 2) where [Ca2+50] represents the free Ca2+ concentration that produces 50% force, and n is the Hill coefficient (37Szczesna D.

Significant differences were determined using an unpaired Student's t test (Sigma Plot version 8.0), with significance defined as follows: *, p < 0.05; #, p < 0.001. Effect of CTnC Mutations on the Ca2+ Sensitivity of Tension—Skinned papillary muscle fibers were treated with CDTA to remove the endogenous porcine CTnC, followed by reconstituting them back with the recombinant CTnCs (WT, G159D, and L29Q).

https://openalex.org/W2029209802,"During cellular migration, regulated actin assembly takes place at the cell leading edge, with continuous disassembly deeper in the cell interior. Actin polymerization at the plasma membrane results in the extension of cellular protrusions in the form of lamellipodia and filopodia. To understand how cells regulate the transformation of lamellipodia into filopodia, and to determine the major factors that control their transition, we studied actin self-assembly in the presence of Arp2/3 complex, WASp-VCA and fascin, the major proteins participating in the assembly of lamellipodia and filopodia. We show that in the early stages of actin polymerization fascin is passive while Arp2/3 mediates the formation of dense and highly branched aster-like networks of actin. Once filaments in the periphery of an aster get long enough, fascin becomes active, linking the filaments into bundles which emanate radially from the aster's surface, resulting in the formation of star-like structures. We show that the number of bundles nucleated per star, as well as their thickness and length, is controlled by the initial concentration of Arp2/3 complex ([Arp2/3]). Specifically, we tested several values of [Arp2/3] and found that for given initial concentrations of actin and fascin, the number of bundles per star, as well as their length and thickness are larger when [Arp2/3] is lower. Our experimental findings can be interpreted and explained using a theoretical scheme which combines Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for aster growth, with a simple mechanistic model for bundles' formation and growth. According to this model, bundles emerge from the aster's (sparsely branched) surface layer. Bundles begin to form when the bending energy associated with bringing two filaments into contact is compensated by the energetic gain resulting from their fascin linking energy. As time evolves the initially thin and short bundles elongate, thus reducing their bending energy and allowing them to further associate and create thicker bundles, until all actin monomers are consumed. This process is essentially irreversible on the time scale of actin polymerization. Two structural parameters, L, which is proportional to the length of filament tips at the aster periphery and b, the spacing between their origins, dictate the onset of bundling; both depending on [Arp2/3]. Cells may use a similar mechanism to regulate filopodia formation along the cell leading edge. Such a mechanism may allow cells to have control over the localization of filopodia by recruiting specific proteins that regulate filaments length (e.g., Dia2) to specific sites along lamellipodia."
https://openalex.org/W2127236008,"Plasmodium species are the causative agents of malaria, the most devastating insect-borne parasite of human populations. Finding and developing new drugs for malaria treatment and prevention is the goal of much research. Angiotensins I and II (ang I and ang II) and six synthetic related peptides designated Vaniceres 1-6 (VC1-VC6) were assayed in vivo and in vitro for their effects on the development of the avian parasite, Plasmodium gallinaceum. Ang II and VC5 injected into the thoraces of the insects reduced mean intensities of infection in the mosquito salivary glands by 88% and 76%, respectively. Although the mechanism(s) of action is not completely understood, we have demonstrated that these peptides disrupt selectively the P.gallinaceum cell membrane. Additionally, incubation in vitro of sporozoites with VC5 reduced the infectivity of the parasites to their vertebrate host. VC5 has no observable agonist effects on vertebrates, and this makes it a promising drug for malaria prevention and chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2008504899,"Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, employs sophisticated means to evade killing by its mammalian hosts. One important immune escape mechanism is the inhibition of complement activation mediated by interactions of the host-derived immune regulators factor H (CFH) and factor H-like protein 1 (CFHL1) with borrelial complement regulator-acquiring surface proteins (BbCRASPs). BbCRASP-2 is a distinctive CFH- and CFHL1-binding protein that is produced by serum-resistant B. burgdorferi strains. Here we show that binding of CFH by BbCRASP-2 is due to electrostatic as well as hydrophobic forces. In addition, 14 individual amino acid residues of BbCRASP-2 were identified as being involved in CFH and CFHL1 binding. Alanine substitutions of most of those residues significantly inhibited binding of CFH and/or CFHL1 by recombinant BbCRASP-2 proteins. To conclusively define the effects of BbCRASP-2 residue substitutions on serum sensitivity in the bacterial context, a serum-sensitive Borrelia garinii strain was transformed with plasmids that directed production of either wild-type or mutated BbCRASP-2 proteins. Critical amino acid residues within BbCRASP-2 were identified, with bacteria producing distinct mutant proteins being unable to bind either CFH or CFHL1, showing high levels of complement components C3, C6, and C5b-9 deposited on their surfaces and being highly sensitive to killing by normal serum.

CFH and CFHL1, the two human immune regulators of the alternative pathway of the complement system, are structurally related plasma proteins. Both glycoproteins are composed of several homologous globular domains termed short consensus repeats (SCRs) (15.Zipfel P.F. Skerka C. Immunol.

CFHL1 is a 42-kDa glycoprotein and produced from an alternatively spliced transcript of the CFH gene, and consists of seven SCRs. The N-terminal seven SCRs of both complement regulators are identical, with the exception of four additional hydrophobic amino acids at the C terminus of CFHL1. Both molecules act as cofactors for factor I-mediated degradation of C3b, accelerate the decay of the C3 convertase of the alternative pathway by competing with Factor B for C3b-binding, and protect self surfaces from harmful attacks (16.Kühn S.

B. afzelii, and B. spielmanii are divided into (i) CFH- and CFHL1-binding proteins (Ba-, Bb-, BsCRASP-1 and Ba-, Bb-, BsCRASP-2), (ii) the CFHL1-binding protein BaCRASP-3 of B. afzelii, and (iii) molecules that soley interact with CFH (BbCRASP-3 to -5 from B. burgdorferi, BaCRASP-4 and BaCRASP-5 from B. afzelii, and BsCRASP-3 from B. spielmanii) (19.Kraiczy P.

CFH/CFHL1 binding protein, BbCRASP-2, was recently identified as being encoded by the cspZ gene (31.Hartmann K. Corvey C. Skerka C. Kirschfink M. Karas M. Brade V. Miller J.C. Stevenson B. Wallich R. Zipfel P.F. Kraiczy P. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1220-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Studies investigating its expression revealed that BbCRASP-2 is poorly produced by Borreliae during tick colonization, but is expressed at high levels during mammalian infection (1.Bykowski T. Woodman M.E. Cooley A.E. Brissette C.A. Brade V. Wallich R. Kraiczy P. Stevenson B. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 4227-4236Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 2.Bykowski T. Woodman M.E.

Additionally, comparative analysis of the cspZ genes of diverse B. burgdorferi (s.s.) strains showed high degrees of sequence conservation, in particular within regions determined to be involved in binding CFH and/or CFHL1 (31.Hartmann K.

Immun. 2007; 75: 5272-5281Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A recent study indicated that production of BbCRASP-2 is not essential for short term (up to 18 days) infection of mice, although the importance of BbCRASP-2 production for long term mammalian infection has yet to be examined (34.Colemann A.S. Yang X. Kumar M. Zhang X. Promnares K. Shroder D. Kenedy M.R. Anderson J.F. Akins D.R. Pal U. PLoS One. 2008; 3: 3010eCrossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the present study we used site-directed mutagenesis to identify amino acid residues within BbCRASP-2 necessary for binding of CFH and CFHL1. A total of 31 residues were mutated, and the recombinant proteins were analyzed for CFH and CFHL1 binding. In addition, the effects on complement susceptibility and deposition of complement components were studied in Borreliae engineered to produce wild-type or mutated BbCRASP-2 proteins. The sensitivity of BbCRASP-2 interactions with CFH was also examined under varying salt and heparin concentrations. Collectively, these analyses defined several amino acids involved in binding of the immune regulators and showed that binding of CFH and CFHL1 contribute to serum resistance of Borreliae. The results presented in this study might further allow the definition of epitopes of BbCRASP-2 useful for vaccine development. Bacterial Strains and Culture Condition—B. garinii strain G1 was originally isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a Lyme disease patient and is highly susceptible to complement-mediated killing in vitro (7.Kraiczy P. Hunfeld K.-P. Breitner-Ruddock S. Würzner R. Acker G. Brade V. Immunobiology. 2000; 201: 406-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Borrelia were grown at 33 °C for 5–6 days up to cell densities of 1 × 107 ml-1 in modified Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly (BSK) medium as described previously (19.Kraiczy P. Skerka C. Brade V. Zipfel P.F. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7800-7809Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli JM109 was used as host for cloning and purification of recombinant proteins. Site-directed Mutagenesis, Sequence Analysis, and Generation of Recombinant Proteins—To introduce single or double amino acid substitutions into the BbCRASP-2-encoding cspZ gene, a site-directed mutagenesis approach was conducted as described by the QuikChange™ protocol (Stratagene). The mutagenic high-performance liquid chromatography-purified primers employed in this study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany) and listed in supplemental Table S1. Briefly, PCR reactions were carried out for 18 cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 13 min) using 100 ng of expression vector pGEX CSPZ, 125 ng of each mutagenic primer, and 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) in a final volume of 50 μl. For the introduction of site-specific mutations into shuttle vector pCSPZ (previously referred as pCRASP-2 (31.Hartmann K. Corvey C. Skerka C. Kirschfink M. Karas M. Brade V. Miller J.C. Stevenson B. Wallich R. Zipfel P.F. Kraiczy P. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1220-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar)), thermal cycling was performed for 18 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 68 °C for 16 min. Before transformation of E. coli, the reactions were treated with 10 units of DpnI (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany) for 1 h at 37 °C. All mutations introduced into the cspZ gene were verified by DNA sequencing of both DNA strands. Proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose columns, with conditions as recommended by the manufacturer (GE Healthcare). Binding and Inhibition Assay—Purified GST-BbCRASP-2, mutated GST-BbCRASP-2 proteins, and GST (2.5 ng/μl each) were immobilized overnight at 4 °C using Immobilizier™ glutathione microtiter plates (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany). Non-specific binding sites were blocked with 0.2% gelatin in PBS for 6 h at 4 °C. CFH (Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) or purified CFHL1 (16.Kühn S. Skerka C. Zipfel P.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5663-5670PubMed Google Scholar) (5 μg/ml each) was added to the wells and left overnight at 4 °C. After addition of polyclonal anti-CFH antibodies (Calbiochem) for 2 h at room temperature, protein complexes were identified using a secondary peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody. Reactions were developed with 1,2-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich). Influences of heparin and salt on CFH binding were analyzed by ELISA. Purified GST-BbCRASP-2 (15 ng/μl) was immobilized onto wells of a microtiter plate (MaxiSorb, Nunc) overnight at 4 °C. Following three washing steps with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 0.2% gelatin in PBS for 6 h at 4 °C. Plates covered with BbCRASP-2 fusion protein were incubated overnight at 4 °C with CFH (0.25 ng/well) in PBST containing increasing concentrations of either low molecular weight heparin (Sigma-Aldrich, 0.5–16 μg/ml) or NaCl (29 mm to 1.16 m). After washing three times in PBS, binding of CFH was detected using mAb VIG8 antibody (35.Prodinger W. Hellwage J. Spruth M. Dierich M.P. Zipfel P.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 31: 41-47Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The experiments were conducted at least three times, and the means ± S.D. were calculated. SDS-PAGE, Ligand Affinity Blot, and Western Blot Analysis—Borrelial cell extracts (15 μg) were subjected to 10% Tris/Tricine-SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose. Binding of CFH and CFHL1 to borrelial proteins was assessed by ligand affinity blotting as previously described (19.Kraiczy P. Skerka C. Brade V. Zipfel P.F. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7800-7809Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, membranes were incubated for 60 min at room temperature with either mAb L41 1C11 (FlaB) (36.Hauser U. Lehnert G. Wilske B. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1999; 37: 2241-2247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or polyclonal anti-GST antibody (GE Healthcare, Germany) as described elsewhere (19.Kraiczy P. Skerka C. Brade V. Zipfel P.F. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7800-7809Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Transformation of Serum-sensitive B. garinii and Characterization of Transformants—High passage, non-infectious B. garinii strain G1 was grown in 100 ml of BSK medium and harvested at mid-exponential phase (5 × 107 to 1 × 108 cells/ml). Electrocompetent cells were prepared as described previously (37.Samuels S.D. Electroporation Protocols for Microorganismen. 47. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1995Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, 50-μl aliquots of competent B. garinii strain G1 cells were electroporated at 12.5 kV/cm in 2-mm cuvettes with 10 μg of plasmid DNA. For control purpose B. garinii strain G1 cells also were transformed with pKFSS1 vector (38.Frank K.L. Bundle S.F. Kresge M.E. Eggers C.H. Samuels D.S. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6723-6727Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) alone. Cells were immediately diluted into 10 ml of BSK medium and incubated with antibiotic selection at 33 °C for 48–72 h. Bacteria were then diluted into 100 ml of BSK medium containing streptomycin (25 μg/ml), and 200-μl aliquots were plated into 96-well cell culture plates (Corning) for selection of transformants. Several clones selected were expanded in 1 ml of fresh BSK medium without antibiotic selection for 7 days, and then transferred into 10 ml of fresh BSK medium containing streptomycin (50 μg/ml). The cspZ genes of transformed B. garinii G1 strains were detected by PCR with specific primers (Table S1). Spirochetes (100 μl) were sedimented by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and suspended in 50 μl of water. Five microliters of suspension was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotide primers at final concentrations of 100 nm each, plus 200 μm dNTPs. PCR was carried out for 25 cycles using the following parameters: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 50 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. Plasmid DNA was prepared from the presumptive E. coli transformants with the Wizard® Plus SV Miniprep DNA purification system (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), and DNA inserts were sequenced by a commercial provider (GATC, Konstanz, Germany). Immunofluorescence Assay for Detection of Surface-exposed BbCRASP-2—For indirect immunofluorescence assays, spirochetes (1 × 107) were incubated with 1:50 dilution of mouse polyclonal anti-BbCRASP-2 for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. Following three washes with PBS containing 0.2% BSA, cells were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS containing 0.2% BSA. Aliquots of 10 μl were then spotted on coverslips and allowed to air dry overnight. After fixation with methanol, samples were dried for 90 min at room temperature and incubated for 90 min in a humidified chamber with a 1:500 dilution of Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes). Slides were then washes four times with 0.2% BSA in PBS and mounted in ProLong® Gold Antifade reagent (Molecular Probes) before being sealed with glass slides. Slides were visualized at a magnification of × 1,000 using an Olympus CX40 fluorescence microscope mounted with a DS-5Mc charge-coupled device camera (Nikon). Immunofluorescence Assay for Detection of Complement Proteins—Spirochetes (6 × 106) were incubated with 25% NHS for 30 min at 37 °C with gentle agitation, washed three times with PBS containing 1% BSA (PBS-BSA). Aliquots of 10 μl were then spotted on microscope slides and allowed to air dry overnight. After fixation, slides were incubated for 1 h in a humidified chamber with antibodies against complement components C3 (dilution of 1:1000), C6 (dilution of 1:200), and C5b-9 (dilution of 1:50). Following four washes with PBS, the slides were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1:2000 dilutions of appropriate Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). Slides were then washed, sealed, and visualized as described above. Serum Adsorption Experiments—Spirochetes harvested by centrifugation were resuspended in 500 μl veronal-buffered saline (supplemented with 1 mm Mg2+, 0.15 mm Ca2+, 0.1% gelatin, pH 7.4) and a portion of 1 × 109 organisms were sedimented by centrifugation. The cell sediment was then resuspended in 750 μl of NHS supplemented with 34 mm EDTA and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. After three washes with PBSA (0.15 m NaCl, 0.03 m phosphate, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.2) containing 0.05% Tween 20, the proteins bound to the spirochetes were eluted by incubation with 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.0, for 15 min. The bacterial cells were sedimented by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the proteins in the supernatant were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Serum Susceptibility Testing of Borrelia Strains—Serum susceptibility of B. garinii strains G1, G1/pKFSS1, G1/pCSPZ, and G1 containing shuttle vector pCSPZ that harbor point mutations in the cspZ gene was assessed by using a growth inhibition assay as described previously (7.Kraiczy P. Hunfeld K.-P. Breitner-Ruddock S. Würzner R. Acker G. Brade V. Immunobiology. 2000; 201: 406-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Each experiment was conducted at least three times, and means ± S.D. were calculated. Human Sera, CFH, CFHL1, and Monoclonal and Polyclonal Antibodies—NHS obtained from 20 healthy human blood donors without known history of spirochetal infections was used as the source for CFH. Purified human CFH was purchased from Calbiochem. CFHL1 were expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda Sf9 insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus (16.Kühn S. Skerka C. Zipfel P.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5663-5670PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Kühn S. Zipfel P.F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2383-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Generation of mAb L41 1C11 against FlaB was described elsewhere (35.Prodinger W. Hellwage J. Spruth M. Dierich M.P. Zipfel P.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 31: 41-47Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). To detect GST fusion proteins a goat anti-GST antibody (GE Healthcare, Germany) was used. Polyclonal rabbit αSCR1–4 antiserum was used for detection of CFHL1 (16.Kühn S. Skerka C. Zipfel P.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5663-5670PubMed Google Scholar), and the mAb VIG8 was applied to specifically detect CFH (35.Prodinger W. Hellwage J. Spruth M. Dierich M.P. Zipfel P.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 31: 41-47Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For detection of both complement regulators a goat anti-human CFH antiserum (Merck Biosciences, Bad Soden, Germany) was used. The goat anti-human C3 and C6 antibodies were purchased from Calbiochem, and the monoclonal anti-human C5b-9 antibody was from Quidel (San Diego, CA). Polyclonal mouse anti-BbCRASP-2 sera were generated by injection (intraperitoneal) of recombinant BbCRASP-2 into Balb/c mice (31.Hartmann K. Corvey C. Skerka C. Kirschfink M. Karas M. Brade V. Miller J.C. Stevenson B. Wallich R. Zipfel P.F. Kraiczy P. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1220-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Identification of Amino Acid Residues within BbCRASP-2 Region 2 Required for CFH and CFHL1 Binding—To identify amino acid residues potentially involved in the interaction of BbCRASP-2 with complement regulators CFH and CFHL1, a comprehensive alanine-scanning approach was conducted (Fig. 1). Charged, hydrophobic, or polar amino acids within the putative CFH and/or CFHL1 binding region 2, which encompasses amino acid positions 70–88 (31.Hartmann K. Corvey C. Skerka C. Kirschfink M. Karas M. Brade V. Miller J.C. Stevenson B. Wallich R. Zipfel P.F. Kraiczy P. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1220-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), were systematically replaced by alanine (Fig. 1). Initially, binding of each recombinant mutant BbCRASP-2 protein to CFH and CFHL1 was quantified using ELISA (Fig. 2). Mutant proteins D70A, S72A, K73A, Q76A, K82A, K83A, N85A, and K86A all bound CFH and CFHL1 with intensities comparable to the wild-type BbCRASP-2 protein. Mutant S79A showed reduced binding to CFH, and binding of CFHL1 was decreased in mutants Q71A and N75A. Replacement of aspartate with alanine at position 84 (mutant D84A) impaired binding of both CFH and CFHL1. The strongest effect on binding of both immune regulators was observed when phenylalanine was replaced by alanine at position 81 (mutant F81A). These results indicate that several amino acid residues within region 2 mediate BbCRASP-2 binding to CFH and CFHL1 and suggest somewhat different interactions with each host protein.FIGURE 2Analysis of CFHL1 and CFH binding to BbCRASP-2 mutants. Purified GST-BbCRASP-2 (positive control), GST-BbCRASP-2 mutants as well as purified GST protein (negative control) were immobilized onto microtiter plates and incubated with purified CFH or CFHL1 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Binding of CFH or CFHL1 was then assessed by an ELISA together with a polyclonal anti-CFH antibody.

https://openalex.org/W2023820230,"Death receptors can directly (type I cells) or indirectly induce apoptosis by activating mitochondrial-regulated apoptosis (type II cells). The level of caspase 8 activation is thought to determine whether a cell is type I or II, with type II cells less efficient at activating this caspase following death receptor activation. FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP) blocks death receptor-mediated apoptosis by inhibiting caspase 8 activation; therefore, we assessed whether silencing FLIP could convert type II cells into type I. FLIP silencing-induced caspase 8 activation in Bax wild-type and null HCT116 colorectal cancer cells; however, complete caspase 3 processing and apoptosis were only observed in Bax wild-type cells. Bax-null cells were also more resistant to chemotherapy and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand and, unlike the Bax wild-type cells, were not sensitized to these agents by FLIP silencing. Further analyses indicated that release of second mitochondrial activator of caspases from mitochondria and subsequent inhibition of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) was required to induce full caspase 3 processing and apoptosis following FLIP silencing. These results indicate that silencing FLIP does not necessarily bypass the requirement for mitochondrial involvement in type II cells. Furthermore, targeting FLIP and XIAP may represent a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of colorectal tumors with defects in mitochondrial-regulated apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2081162815,"Polyamines play important roles in cell growth mainly through their interaction with RNA. We have previously reported that polyamines stimulate the synthesis of oligopeptide-binding protein OppA in Escherichia coli and the formation of Ile-tRNA in rat liver (Igarashi, K., and Kashiwagi, K. (2000) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 271, 559-564). These effects involve an interaction of polyamines with the bulged-out region of double-stranded RNA in the initiation region of OppA mRNA and in the acceptor stem of rat liver tRNA(Ile). In this study, the effects of polyamines on E. coli OppA synthesis and rat liver Ile-tRNA formation were compared using OppA mRNA and tRNA(Ile) with or without the bulged-out region of double-stranded RNA. The results indicate that the bulged-out region is involved in polyamine stimulation of OppA synthesis and Ile-tRNA formation. A selective structural change by spermidine in the bulged-out region of double-stranded RNA was confirmed by circular dichroism."

Phylogenetic analysis indicated that AdiC belongs to the amino acid/polyamine/organocation (APC) transporter superfamily having sequence identities of 15–17% to eukaryotic and human APC transporters. For functional and structural characterization, we cloned, overexpressed, and purified wild-type AdiC and the point mutant AdiC-W293L, which is unable to bind and consequently transport l-arginine. Purified detergent-solubilized AdiC particles were dimeric. Reconstitution experiments yielded two-dimensional crystals of AdiC-W293L diffracting beyond 6 Å resolution from which we determined the projection structure at 6.5 Å resolution. The projection map showed 10–12 density peaks per monomer and suggested mainly tilted helices with the exception of one distinct perpendicular membrane spanning α-helix. Comparison of AdiC-W293L with the projection map of the oxalate/formate antiporter from Oxalobacter formigenes, a member from the major facilitator superfamily, indicated different structures.

Enteric pathogens such as Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, spp., and certain Escherichia coli strains can survive the extremely acidic conditions of the human stomach and cause intestinal diseases (1Donnenberg M.S. Nature. 2000; 406: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To overcome the protective barrier of the gastric acidity, pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains of E. coli have developed acid resistance systems. One of these systems requires arginine to protect E. coli during low pH exposure. This arginine system is composed of an arginine-agmatine exchange transporter and of an acid-activated arginine decarboxylase (2Foster J.W. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Acidification of the cytosol is prevented by the consumption of protons through decarboxylation of arginine to agmatine and carbon dioxide. Agmatine is then exported out of the cytosol, and new arginine is imported through the arginine-agmatine transporter in a one-to-one exchange stoichiometry (2Foster J.W. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 898-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). This recently identified transport protein is the product of the adiC gene (3Gong S. Richard H. Foster J.W. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 4402-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 4Iyer R. Williams C. Miller C. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 6556-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In vitro, AdiC-mediated exchange transport of arginine and agmatine is tightly coupled, electrogenic, and acid-activated (5Fang Y. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 176-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). AdiC forms stable homodimers in detergent and phospholipid membranes as determined by gel filtration and glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments (5Fang Y. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 176-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).The origin of AdiC is somehow controversial as it was assigned to two families of transport proteins, i.e. the amino acid/polyamine/organocation (APC) 7The abbreviations used are: APC, amino acid/polyamine/organocation; CAT, cationic amino acid transporters; MFS, major facilitator superfamily; LAT, l-type amino acid transporters; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; APA, amino acid/polyamine antiporter; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside; OxlT, oxalate/formate antiporter from O. formigenes; BN, blue native. 7The abbreviations used are: APC, amino acid/polyamine/organocation; CAT, cationic amino acid transporters; MFS, major facilitator superfamily; LAT, l-type amino acid transporters; TEM, transmission electron microscopy; APA, amino acid/polyamine antiporter; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; DDM, n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside; OxlT, oxalate/formate antiporter from O. formigenes; BN, blue native. transporter superfamily (6Jack D.L. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1797-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) (5Fang Y. Kolmakova-Partensky L. Miller C. J.

Liu J. Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Tseng T.T. Virk P.S. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 257-279PubMed Google Scholar). The APC superfamily of transporters consists of nearly 250 members that function as solute-cation symporters and solute-solute antiporters (6Jack D.L. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1797-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). According to hydropathy profile analysis and biochemically established topological features of most prokaryotic and eukaryotic APC superfamily members, both the N and C termini of the proteins are located in the cytoplasm with a 12-transmembrane segment topology (6Jack D.L.

Two subfamilies of the APC transporter superfamily, i.e. the cationic amino acid transporters (CATs) and the l-type amino acid transporters (LATs), have human members involved in relevant physiological functions and diseases. CAT2 provides arginine for NO synthesis (12Nicholson B. Manner C.K. Kleeman J. MacLeod C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15881-15885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and for arginase (13Yeramian A. Martin L. Serrat N. Arpa L. Soler C. Bertran J. McLeod C. Palacin M.

LAT1 is overexpressed in a wide spectrum of primary human cancers and plays important roles in the growth and survival of cancer cell lines (15Fuchs B.C. Bode B.P. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2005; 15: 254-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Mutations in the human LAT members b0,+AT (and in its associated heavy subunit rBAT) and y+LAT1 cause the primary inherited aminoacidurias cystinuria, and lysinuric protein intolerance, respectively (16Calonge M.J.

Another LAT transporter, xCT, is Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus fusion-entry receptor (20Kaleeba J.A. Berger E.A. Science. 2006; 311: 1921-1924Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).Structural information on amino acid transporters is sparse. Only two high resolution structures have been reported so far, that of the bacterial glutamate transporter Gltph (21Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) and that of the bacterial leucine transporter LeuTAa (22Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). Thus, besides low resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) data on single detergent-solubilized Ser/Thr exchanger transport proteins (SteT) (23Reig N. del Rio C. Casagrande F. Ratera M. Gelpi J.L. Torrents D. Henderson P.J. Xie H. Baldwin S.A. Zorzano A. Fotiadis D. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13270-13281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), no structural information is available for other members of the APC transporter superfamily. The low number of amino acid transporter structures and of membrane proteins in general is related to the difficulty in growing highly ordered three-dimensional membrane protein crystals for structure determination by x-ray crystallography. Cryo-TEM combined with electron crystallography of two-dimensional crystals to establish the three-dimensional protein structure is an attractive alternative to x-ray crystallography and three-dimensional crystals (24Stahlberg H. Fotiadis D. Scheuring S. Remigy H. Braun T. Mitsuoka K. Fujiyoshi Y. Engel A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 504: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). An important advantage of two-dimensional membrane protein crystals is that the protein is embedded in its native environment, the lipid bilayer. Recently, the first two-dimensional crystals of an amino acid transporter, i.e. Gltph, have been reported (25Raunser S. Appel M. Ganea C. Geldmacher-Kaufer U. Fendler K. Kuhlbrandt W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12796-12805Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Here we present for the first time structural data at subnanometer resolution of the l-arginine/agmatine antiporter AdiC. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that AdiC belongs to the APC superfamily and not to the MFS. This assignment was further supported by the different projection structure of AdiC, as obtained by cryo-TEM of two-dimensional crystals, compared with that of the oxalate/formate antiporter from Oxalobacter formigenes, a typical member from the MFS. To grow two-dimensional crystals, we overexpressed AdiC and the mutant AdiC-W293L in E. coli and purified both forms to homogeneity. Negative-stain TEM and blue native-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) of both detergent-solubilized AdiC proteins revealed a homodimeric state. Reconstitution experiments yielded first well ordered two-dimensional crystals of AdiC-W293L suitable for structure analysis by cryo-TEM. The projection map calculated from unstained two-dimensional crystals revealed the structure of AdiC-W293L at 6.5 Å resolution. The present work sets the basis for the structural analysis of AdiC at high resolution using two-dimensional crystals and cryo-TEM/electron crystallography. Importantly, AdiC represents an excellent model for understanding the molecular architecture of transporters from the APC superfamily.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—E. coli polar lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) and n-dodecyl-β-d-maltopyranoside (DDM) from Anatrace (Maumee, OH). Radiolabeled l-[3H]Arginine was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO), and amino acids and amines were from Sigma-Aldrich.Phylogenetic Analysis of AdiC—Comparative searches of the AdiC gene (National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenInfo (gi): 16131941) were performed using the BLAST algorithm (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast) against the default nr protein data base (GenBank™ CDS translations + RefSeq Proteins + PDB + SwissProt + PIR + PRF) and using default parameters. To build the phylogenetic tree, we first performed a multiple alignment using PROBCONS (26Do C.B. Mahabhashyam M.S. Brudno M. Batzoglou S. Genome Res. 2005; 15: 330-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) with the AdiC protein sequence and other protein sequences collected from NCBI and the TCDB Transport Classification Database (6Jack D.L. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 1797-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) that are representatives of the following APC subfamilies: amino acid/polyamine antiporter (APA) (PotE/gi: 26246666 from E. coli; CadB/gi: 536977 from E. coli; ArcD/gi: 254827 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa; LysI/gi: 38233510 from Corynebacterium glutamicum; YvsH/gi: 16080387 from Bacillus subtilis), ACT (GabA/gi: 4972245 from Emericella nidulans and Uga4/gi: 6319991 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae), CAT (CAT1/gi: 161016790 from Mus musculus; CAT2/gi: 113680130 from M. musculus; AAT1/gi: 30685317 from Arabidopsis thaliana; YfnA/gi: 16077801 from B. subtilis), GGA (XasA/gi: 33241625 from Chlamydophila pneumoniae), AGT (yveA/gi: 16080500 from B. subtilis; ybeC/gi: 16077281 from B. subtilis), and LAT (SteT/gi: 16078351 from B. subtilis and eukaryotic LATs: LAT2/gi: 33286428 from Homo sapiens, LAT1/gi: 71979932 from H. sapiens, y+LAT1/gi: 21361563 from H. sapiens), and b0,+AT from Monodelphis domestica (ENMSEBL:ENSMODP00000015349), from Canis familiaris (ENMSEBL:ENSCAFP00000011140), and from Rattus norvegicus (ENMSEBL:ENSRNOP00000016919). As outgroup for the tree, we selected Mmup/gi: 172051482 of E. coli that belongs to the AAT family. We next evaluated this alignment and obtained the tree using the Bayesian phylogenetic method (27Huelsenbeck J.P. Ronquist F. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 754-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (18920) Google Scholar) (GTR model, 5 million generations and excluding 40% of the initial trees). The tree was elaborated and prepared for proper display with the iTOL online tool (28Letunic I. Bork P. Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 127-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1820) Google Scholar).Cloning, Mutagenesis, and Overexpression of AdiC and AdiC-W293L—AdiC was cloned from genomic E. coli strain DH5α DNA as previously described for other transporters (23Reig N. del Rio C. Casagrande F. Ratera M. Gelpi J.L. Torrents D. Henderson P.J. Xie H. Baldwin S.A. Zorzano A. Fotiadis D. Palacin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13270-13281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, the following primers (5′-3′) were used to amplify the AdiC open reading frame by PCR: ATGAGAATTCACTATCGAATGCAGGCGTATG and TCATCTCGAGGTTGGCTTTTATGTTTGCTGGA. PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and ligated into a pBlueScript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Another PCR with the following primers (5′-3′) was performed to subclone the AdiC open reading frame into the EcoRI and PstI sites of a modified version of the vector pTTQ18 (29Xie H. Patching S.G. Gallagher M.P. Litherland G.J. Brough A.R. Venter H. Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Young J.D. Herbert R.B. Henderson P.J. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2004; 21: 323-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), thereby placing its expression under the control of the tac promoter: TGATGAATTCGATGTCTTCGGATGCTGATGC and ACCGCCTGCAGAATCTTTGCTTATTGGTGCA. Mutation W293L in AdiC was introduced in AdiC cloned into pTTQ18 using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with primer (5′-3′) GCTTAGGTTCACTGGGCGGCT(T)GACGTTGCTGGCGGGTC and its complementary reverse primer. For isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) studies AdiC was amplified from the pBlueScript construct using as primers (5′-3′) CAATGGATCCATGTCTTCGGATGCTGATGCTC and TCATCTCGAGGTTGGCTTTTATGTTTGCTGGA and subcloned into BamHI and XhoI sites of the pTrcHisA vector. All DNA constructs were verified by sequencing. Expression experiments were carried out with freshly transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pTTQ18-His6-AdiC, pTTQ18-His6-AdiC-W293L, or pTrcHisA-AdiC. In cultures grown in LB medium, optimal expression of the AdiC proteins occurred after 3 h at 37 °C after induction at A600 of 0.5 with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Routinely, four to six liters of medium in flasks were inoculated with the corresponding AdiC construct, and after 3 h of growth at 37 °C, cells were harvested. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA).Preparation of E. coli Membranes—Cell pellets were disrupted by passage through a French pressure cell (20,000 p.s.i.). Unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation (10 min at 10,000 × g, 4 °C). The supernatant was ultracentrifuged (1 h at 100,000 × g, 4 °C), and the pellet was resuspended and homogenized (30-ml glass homogenizer) in lysis buffer and ultracentrifuged again. Peripheral membrane proteins were removed by homogenization in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl and ultracentrifugation. Finally, the membrane pellet was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl at a protein concentration between 13 and 25 mg/ml. Aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use.Purification of AdiC and AdiC-W293L and Determination of Protein Concentration—Frozen E. coli total membranes containing overexpressed AdiC or AdiC-W293L were thawed and solubilized for 2 h at 4 °C under gentle agitation in 1% DDM, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01% NaN3. The protein concentration during solubilization was between 2 and 3 mg/ml. After ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 50 min at 4 °C) the supernatant was diluted 2-fold with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 0.04% DDM, 5 mm histidine, 10% glycerol, 0.01% NaN3 (washing buffer) and bound for 2 h at 4 °C to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow beads (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The beads were then loaded onto a spin column (Promega, Madison, WI), washed with washing buffer, and eluted with the same buffer containing 200 mm histidine. For ITC studies protein bound beads were washed twice with 20 mm imidazole in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% DDM. AdiC-W293L was eluted with 300 mm imidazole in the same buffer. Untagged AdiC was eluted by overnight digestion at room temperature with enterokinase (Invitrogen) (5 units/mg of protein) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% DDM. Then protein was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 (10/300) column (GE Healthcare) and concentrated with Vivaspin MWCO100 (Sigma-Aldrich). Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and using a molar extinction coefficient of 85,830 m-1 cm-1 (His-tagged AdiC), 91,830 m-1 cm-1 (untagged AdiC), and 80,330 m-1 cm-1 (His-tagged AdiC-W293L). These values were calculated from the amino acid sequence of the different AdiC versions using the ProtParam tool from the ExPASy proteomics server.Transport Measurements—For functional studies, purified AdiC proteins were reconstituted into proteoliposomes as previously described (23Reig N. del Rio C. Casagrande F. Ratera M. Gelpi J.L. Torrents D. Henderson P.J. Xie H. Baldwin S.A. Zorzano A. Fotiadis D. Palacin M. J. Biol.

(23Reig N. del Rio C. Casagrande F. Ratera M. Gelpi J.L. Torrents D. Henderson P.J. Xie H. Baldwin S.A. Zorzano A. Fotiadis D. Palacin M. J. Biol.

All experimental values were corrected by subtracting zero time values and are reported as the means ± S.E.ITC—All solutions were degassed before titration in an ITC instrument (MicroCal). A solution of AdiC or AdiC-W293L (0.1 mm in 1.4 ml of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% DDM)) was loaded into the sample cell, 2.5 mm titrant l-arginine in the same buffer was loaded into the injection syringe, and the system was equilibrated at 25 °C. Titration curves were generated by 30 successive 10-μl injections at 240-s intervals. ITC performed with two independent preparations of AdiC and AdiC-W293L gave very similar results. Control injections were performed in the absence of protein to determine background corrections due to substrate dilution. The data were fitted to a Single Set of Identical Sites Model with the Origin software (OriginLab).Two-dimensional Crystallization of AdiC—Purified AdiC and AdiC-W293L protein solubilized in DDM was mixed with E. coli polar lipids solubilized in the same detergent (stock solution: 5 mg/ml E. coli polar lipids, 1% DDM, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01% NaN3) to achieve a lipid-to-protein ratio of 0.3 (w/w). The final AdiC/AdiC-W293L protein concentration was adjusted to about 1 mg/ml. The protein/lipid/detergent mix was dialyzed against detergent-free buffer, i.e. 20 mm citric acid-NaOH, pH 5, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.01% NaN3, 5 mm l-arginine for about 2 weeks at room temperature.Blue Native Gel Electrophoresis—Linear 5–12% gradient gels for BN-PAGE were prepared and run as previously described (30Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar). Thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (140 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (66 kDa) were used as standard proteins.Negative Stain TEM—DDM-solubilized AdiC or AdiC-W293L protein at ∼3 μg/ml was adsorbed for ∼10 s to Parlodion carbon-coated copper grids rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge at low pressure in air. Grids were washed with three drops of double-distilled water and stained with 2 drops of 0.75% uranyl formate. Grids of negatively stained two-dimensional AdiC-W293L crystals (Fig. 5) were prepared similarly but included a longer adsorption time of ∼60 s. Electron micrographs were recorded at a magnification of 50,000× on Eastman Kodak Co. SO-163 sheet films with a Hitachi H-7000 electron microscope operated at 100 kV.Cryo-TEM—Two-dimensional crystals of AdiC-W293L were adsorbed to a thin carbon film on a molybdenum grid and frozen in liquid nitrogen in the presence of 7% (w/v) trehalose (31Hirai T. Murata K. Mitsuoka K. Kimura Y. Fujiyoshi Y. J. Electron Microsc. (Tokyo). 1999; 48: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Frozen grids were transferred into a Philips CM200-FEG electron microscope using a Gatan 626 cryo-holder. Electron micrographs were recorded on Eastman Kodak Co. SO-163 films at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV, a magnification of 50,000× using a low-dose system (∼10 electrons per Å2), and a measured specimen temperature of about -175 °C. The range of defocus values used was between 5,300 and 11,600 Å.Image Processing—Electron micrographs of selected AdiC-W293L crystals were scanned using a Heidelberg Primescan D7100 scanner with a sampling of 1 Å/pixel at the sample level. The images were processed using the IPLT image processing toolkit (32Philippsen A. Schenk A.D. Signorell G.A. Mariani V. Berneche S. Engel A. J. Struct. Biol. 2007; 157: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 33Philippsen A. Schenk A.D. Stahlberg H. Engel A. J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 144: 4-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to correct for the contrast transfer function and crystal distortions. The parameters of the contrast transfer function and the crystal lattice were fitted manually using the graphical user interface provided by IPLT. The five best images were scaled using one image as reference and merged to produce the final data set from which the projection represented as a contour map was generated within IPLT. No B-factor was used to sharpen the data. The plane group symmetry was determined using ALLSPACE (34Valpuesta J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To generate the improved projection map of AdiC-W293L (Fig. 6B), one of the four identical AdiC-W293L dimers in the unit cell was symmetrized with IPLT exploiting the internal, non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis of the dimer.FIGURE 6Projection structure of AdiC-W293L. A, p22121-symmetrized projection map of AdiC-W293L at 6.5 Å resolution calculated from five electron micrographs. The black rectangle marks the unit cell (lattice dimensions: a = 184 Å, b = 119 Å, γ = 90°), which contains four AdiC-W293L dimers (two up- and two down-oriented dimers). B, improved projection map of AdiC-W293L after symmetrization of one of the four identical dimers in the unit cell exploiting the internal, non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry axis of the dimer. The only strong density peak in the projection structure of the AdiC-W293L monomers is marked by arrowheads. The putative intradimeric contact sites are indicated by stars. The 2-fold axes perpendicular to the membrane plane and the screw axes parallel to the membrane plane are indicated. Solid lines indicate density above the mean, whereas negative contours are shown as light gray lines. The scale bar represents 25 Å.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTSPhylogenetic Analysis of AdiC—The origin and evolution of the AdiC protein appears to be controversial, as it has been reported to belong to two distant groups of membrane transporters: MFS (5Fang Y.

To clarify this issue, we have analyzed de novo the phylogenetic relationship of AdiC with known transport proteins. We have combined two rounds of computational searches and comparisons with different levels of sensitivities and accuracies (see the “Experimental Procedures”). As an initial and rough approximation, we first used BLAST to compare the AdiC protein sequence against a non-redundant protein sequence data base and observed that the closest matches (other than predicted, potential, or hypothetical) were prokaryotic amino acid/polyamine antiporters, e.g. the proteins with the gi values of 152969070, 44886079, 10801580, and 123443711 (PotE) at the NCBI data base. These transporters belong to the basic APA family, a subgroup of the APC superfamily (6Jack D.L. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H.

As seen in Fig. 1, the tree indicated that AdiC clearly clusters with members of the APA family. In addition, the phylogenetic analysis revealed that eukaryotic and human APC transporters closest related to AdiC are members from the LAT family, e.g. xCT, y+LAT1, and b0,+AT, with sequence identities of 15–17%.FIGURE 1Origin and evolutionary relationship of AdiC wit"
https://openalex.org/W2003443332,"Acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) is expressed in an exaggerated fashion in epithelial cells at sites of pulmonary T helper cell type 2 inflammation and plays important roles in the pathogenesis of anti-parasite and asthma-like responses. However, the mechanisms that control epithelial cell AMCase secretion and its effector responses have not been adequately defined. To address these issues, we used in vivo and in vitro experimental systems to define the pathways of epithelial AMCase secretion and its epithelial regulatory effects. Here we demonstrate that, in murine T helper cell type 2 modeling systems, AMCase colocalizes with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ADAM17 (a membrane disintegrin and metallopeptidase 17) in lung epithelial cells. In vitro cotransfection experiments in A549 cells demonstrated that AMCase and EGFR physically interact with each other. Cotransfection of AMCase and EGFR also increased, whereas EGFR inhibition decreased AMCase secretion. Interestingly, AMCase secretion was not significantly altered by treatment with EGF but was significantly decreased when the upstream EGFR transactivator ADAM17 was inhibited. AMCase secretion was also decreased when the EGFR-downstream Ras was blocked. Transfected and recombinant AMCase induced epithelial cell production of CCL2, CCL17, and CXCL8. These studies demonstrate that lung epithelial cells secrete AMCase via an EGFR-dependent pathway that is activated by ADAM17 and mediates its effects via Ras. They also demonstrate that the AMCase that is secreted feeds back in an autocrine and/or paracrine fashion to stimulate pulmonary epithelial cell chemokine production.

Studies from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that the Th2-associated cytokine interleukin-13 (IL-13) is a central regulator of these responses (1Elias J.A. Lee C.G. Zheng T. Shim Y.

In accord with its importance, the mechanisms that IL-13 uses to induce these responses have been intensively investigated. These studies demonstrated that the effects of IL-13 are mediated by a variety of downstream mediators, including CC chemokines, TGF-β1, adenosine and adenosine receptors, vascular endothelial growth factor, IL-11, and the 18-glycosyl hydrolase protein, acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) (1Elias J.A.

The last is particularly intriguing, because these studies demonstrated that (a) AMCase is induced in epithelial cells and macrophages at sites of Th2 inflammation, (b) IL-13 is necessary and sufficient to stimulate AMCase production, (c) exaggerated AMCase expression can be readily appreciated in biopsies from patients with asthma, and (d) anti-AMCase-based interventions ameliorate Th2 inflammation and physiologic dysregulation in a chitin-free experimental system (6Zhu Z.

These studies also demonstrated that epithelial cells store AMCase in intracellular granules and secrete the enzyme into their local microenvironment (7Homer R.J. Zhu Z. Cohn L. Lee C.G. White W.I.

Most frequently, the availability of these ligands is regulated via ectodomain shedding and receptor transactivation by specific metalloproteinases (13Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M.

Several lines of evidence have linked ADAM17/EGFR and asthma, including animal studies that demonstrated that many of the epithelial alterations at sites of Th2 inflammation can be ameliorated by EGFR inhibition (10Takeyama K.

Nadel J.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). A number of studies have also linked epithelial ADAM17 and EGFR signaling to IL-13. These studies demonstrated that IL-13 induces mucus metaplasia via an EGFR-dependent pathway (17Shim J.J. Dabbagh K. Ueki I.F. Dao-Pick T. Burgel P.R. Takeyama K. Tam D.C. Nadel J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: L134-L140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ADAM17 plays a critical role in the regulation of MUC5AC mucin expression in cultured human airway epithelial cells (18Shao M.X. Ueki I.F. Nadel J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sandifer T. Martin E.L. Martin L.D. Respir. Res. 2007; 8: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Given the important roles of ADAM17 and EGFR signaling in IL-13-mediated activation of epithelial cells and allergic asthma, we hypothesized that a ADAM17/EGFR pathway contributes to the secretion of AMCase by lung epithelial cells. We also hypothesized that secreted AMCase feeds back to regulate epithelial cell function. To test these hypotheses, studies were undertaken to define the interactions of AMCase and EGFR and the role of the EGFR pathway in epithelial AMCase secretion. The effector responses of secreted AMCase were also evaluated. These studies demonstrate that respiratory epithelial cells secrete AMCase via a ADAM17/EGFR/Ras-dependent pathway. They also highlight the ability of AMCase to stimulate epithelial chemokine elaboration. Reagents—Cell culture media and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen. Restriction endonucleases and other DNA-modifying enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by IDT, Inc. (Coralville, IA) or the Yale University Keck facility center. cDNAs were purchased from Clontech. PCR kits for gene amplification or cloning were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The immunoprecipitation kit was from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Staurosporine, the PI3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin, and the Ras inhibitor manumycin A (a farnesyltransferase inhibitor of Ras) were from Sigma. The pharmacological inhibitors PD153035 (a kinase inhibitor that specifically blocks the ATP binding site and inactivates EGFR signaling) and AG1478 (a small molecule EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor) were purchased from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). The TAPI-1 and -2 (TNFα-processing inhibitor-1/2, ADAM17-specific inhibitors) were from Peptides International (Louisville, KY). The ERK inhibitor PD98059 was bought from Calbiochem. The primary anti-human polycloncal and the rabbit anti-mouse monocloncal AMCase antibodies were generated using phage display technology and were provided by Medimmune (Gaithersburg, MD). Recombinant human AMCase was from Medimmune (Gaithersburg, MD). Mouse monoclonal antibody reactive to β-tubulin was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary APC-labeled antibodies were from BD Biosciences. A primary anti-EGFR was from Abgent (San Diego, CA). Anti-human ADAM17 monoclonal antibody was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and employed as reported previously (20Walcheck B. Herrera A.H. St Hill C. Mattila P.E. Whitney A.R. Deleo F.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 2006; 36: 968-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Secondary Pe-Cy7- and APC-Cy7-labeled antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. An anti-mouse CD31 fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody and the corresponding isotype control were from BD Biosciences. Anti-mouse pancytokeratin PE antibody was from Abcam. Anti-mouse CD45-PcP was from BD Biosciences. Flow Cytometry—Whole lung cell suspensions were obtained by a modified method according to Rice et al. (48Rice W.R. Conkright J.J. Na C.L. Ikegami M. Shannon J.M. Weaver T.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L256-L264Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In brief, lung tissue was digested using dispase (5 mg/ml; Stem Cell Technologies), collagenase (0.04%; Sigma), and 100 units/ml DNase (Sigma). Whole lung suspension cells underwent several centrifugations (10 min, 300–1000 g) and hemolysis (precooled hemolysis solution containing 11 mm KHCO3, 152 mm NH4Cl; washing for 5 min, 400 g at 4 °C), were then strained through progressively smaller cell strainers (100–20 μm) and nylon gauze, and were finally resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer (PBS, 2% bovine serum albumin, 2% fetal calf serum) supplemented with 10 units/ml DNase I. Macrophages were depleted from the lung cell suspensions by repeated means of adhesion to plastic plates at 37 °C. For cell surface staining, cells were treated for 30 min at 4 °C with appropriate combinations of specific antibodies for surface staining of CD45, CD31, EGFR, or ADAM17. The corresponding isotype controls or secondary antibodies only were stained in parallel. For intracellular staining, cells were fixed with 0.5 ml of ice-cold 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using 0.5% saponin (Sigma) prior to antibody staining with anti-AMCase or anti-pancytokeratin or the respective isotype controls. Lung epithelial cells were characterized according to the following gating algorithm. Within digested and strained red cell and macrophage-depleted whole lung cell suspensions, nondebris cells were gated, and CD45+ cells were further excluded. Within CD45- negative lung cells, CD31+ endothelial cells were excluded. Within the CD45-CD31- lung cell population, cells positive for intracellular pancytokeratin were considered as epithelial cells according to a modified method, as described previously (21Schutte B. Tinnemans M.M. Pijpers G.F. Lenders M.H. Ramaekers F.C. Cytometry. 1995; 21: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 22Rochat T.R. Casale J.M. Hunninghake G.W. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1988; 112: 418-425PubMed Google Scholar). For co-expression studies of intracellular proteins (AMCase) with extracellular receptors (ADAM17 and EGFR), lung cells were first surface-stained with anti-EGFR or anti-ADAM17, were permeabilized, and then underwent staining for intracellular AMCase. Saturating concentrations of the antibodies were used, as determined by titration experiments prior to the study. At least 10,000 cells/sample were analyzed. All antibodies and fluorescence-activated cell sorting reagents were from BD Biosciences except when otherwise indicated. Isotype controls were subtracted from the respective specific antibody expression, and the results are reported as mean fluorescence intensity. Calculations were performed with Cell Quest analysis software (BD Biosciences). All experiments were performed in triplicate. IL-13-overexpressing Mice—C57BL/6 wild type (WT) were obtained from the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). CC10-rtTA-IL-13 transgenic mice were generated in our laboratory (23Zheng T. Zhu Z. Wang Z. Homer R.J. Ma B. Riese Jr., R.J. Chapman Jr., H.A. Shapiro S.D. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar), bred onto a C57BL/6 background, and used in these studies. These mice utilize the Clara cell 10-kDa protein (CC10) promoter and the reverse tetracycline transactivator (rtTA) to target IL-13 to the lung in a doxycycline-inducible manner. These animals have very low to undetectable levels of IL-13 in their lungs at base line and 1.9–2.1 ng/ml quantities after transgene induction by adding doxycycline for 4 weeks to the animals' drinking water. When CC10-IL-13 mice were being evaluated, Tg (-) littermate animals were used as controls. These studies were approved by the Yale University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. OVA Sensitization and Challenge—OVA sensitization and challenge were accomplished using a modification of the protocols previously described by our laboratory (23Zheng T. Zhu Z. Wang Z. Homer R.J. Ma B. Riese Jr., R.J. Chapman Jr., H.A. Shapiro S.D. Elias J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). In brief, 6–8-week-old WT mice were received injections containing 20 μg of chicken OVA (Sigma) complexed to alum (Resorptar, Indergen, New York, NY) or alum alone. This process was repeated 5 days later. After an additional 7 days, the animals received three aerosol challenges (40 min a day, 3 days) with 1% OVA (w/v) in endotoxin-free PBS or PBS alone. The aerosol was generated in a NE-U07 ultrasonic nebulizer (Omron Health Care, Vernon Hills, IL). The mice were sacrificed 24, 48, or 72 h after aerosol exposure. Expression of Recombinant AMCase and EGFR—Human AMCase full-length cDNA plasmid constructed in expression vector pcDNA3.1 was obtained from MedImmune (Gaithersburg, MD). Human AMCase cDNA was amplified using PCR with the following primers: hAMCase-L-upper, 5′-ATG GAG GCC GAA TTC ATG GTT TCT ACT CCT GAG AAC-3′; hAMCase-L-lower, 5′-ATC TGC AGA ATT CCA CAT TGC CCA GTT GCA GCA ATC-3′. The wild-type human full-length EGFR cloned into the retroviral LXSN vector was a gift from David Stern (Yale University, New Haven, CT). The plasmid pCMV-β-Gal (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was used to monitor transfection efficiency. A549 cells were incubated for 6 h with vector DNA mixtures that did not contain pcDNA 3.1 or contained AMCase or EGFR inserts. After incubation, the cells were washed and incubated for an additional 18 or 42 h in complete medium for immunoprecipitation assay and in Opti-MEM medium for bioactivity assay. Under these conditions, the transfection efficiency was found to be greater than 90% as determined by a β-galactosidase assay. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorff microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 5 min, and the clear supernatants were saved. The presence of AMCase was verified by Western blotting. The activity of expressed AMCase was verified by an enzymatic assay as described below in detail. Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis—Whole lung and cell monolayer lysates were evaluated by Western blotting. Lung lysates were prepared using lysis buffer as previously described. The cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 1 mm sodium fluoride and lysed with lysis buffer (15 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and one tablet of complete miniprotease inhibitor mixture/10 ml of lysis buffer). The lysates were then clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and supernatant protein concentrations were determined with a Bio-Rad assay kit. The samples were then mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol) and heated in a boiling water bath, and equal amounts were loaded onto 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to Immune-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). After transfer, the membranes were blocked for 1 h in nonfat dried milk, rinsed, incubated with the appropriate primary antibodies for 1.5 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, washed, incubated with secondary antibody (diluted 1:1000–1:2000) for 1.5 h at room temperature, and washed in 0.05% Tween 20. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using 20× LumiGLO Reagent and 20× peroxide according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA). The membranes were exposed to BioMax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Immunoprecipitation—A549 cells (2 × 106/10-cm diameter dish) were transfected with 24 μg of DNA with 60 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. 48 h later, the cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 1 mm sodium fluoride and lysed with lysis buffer mentioned above. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C. AMCase and associated proteins were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-AMCase polyclonal antibody or anti-EGFR (Invitrogen), respectively, using the Catch and Release version 2.0 reversible immunoprecipitation system (Millipore). The precipitate was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and probed with monoclonal antibody against EGFR or AMCase followed by chemiluminescence detection. Parallel protein immunoblots of each sample were performed to confirm the expected expression of EGFR or AMCase constructs in the cells. Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Microscopy— Immunohistochemistry of AMCase was performed as described by our laboratory previously (7Homer R.J. Zhu Z. Cohn L. Lee C.G. White W.I. Chen S. Elias J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: L502-L511Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), using a polyclonal rabbit anti-human AMCase or monocloncal rabbit anti-mouse antibody developed by MedImmune (Gaithersburg, MD) (171.204), with specificity for AMCase. The antibody was applied to the lung sections at a 1:100 dilution. To verify the specificity of the reactions, the rabbit antibody was incubated with AMCase-specific peptide (amino acids 428–446) at a 1:1 ratio for 2 h before being applied to the tissues. The mouse monoclonal antibody specificity was determined by ELISA against other murine chitinase family members (chitotriosidase, Ym1, Ym2, and YKL-40) and by comparison of the staining pattern with the rabbit antibody as described previously by our group (7Homer R.J. Zhu Z. Cohn L. Lee C.G. White W.I. Chen S. Elias J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: L502-L511Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In all cases, BD Pharmingen™ Retrievagen A (pH 6) antigen retrieval solution was used for 20 min. The avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) was selected to treat the section for two-color staining of lung tissue. For two-color fluorescence, secondary reagents included anti-mouse or anti-rabbit, either biotinylated or directly conjugated with Alexa-488 (Molecular Probes) or anti-rabbit Cy3 (Sigma). Tissues were mounted using VECTASHIELD mounting medium for fluorescence (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). For combined AMCase-EGFR staining, streptavidin Alexa-488 (green dye) was combined with Cy3 (red dye). Confocal microscopy was performed with a Zeiss LSM 510 META system with an optical thickness of either 5.0 or 1.0 μm. Chitinase Bioactivity—The chitinase bioactivity in cell culture supernatants and cell lysates was determined using a fluorogenic substrate as described previously (24Spindler K.D. Spindler-Barth M. EXS. 1999; 87: 201-209PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of each sample was mixed with 30 μl of citrate/phosphate buffer (0.1 and 0.2 m, respectively), pH 5.2, and 20 μl of 0.5 mg/ml substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-d-N,N′-diacetylchitobioside (Sigma) at a final concentration of 0.17 mm. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for varying amounts of time, and the reactions were stopped by adding 1 ml of stop solution (0.3 m glycine/NaOH buffer, pH 10.6). The fluorescence intensity of released 4-methylumbelliferone was measured with a fluorometer (excitation 350 nm and emission 450 nm). A standard curve was generated using serially diluted 4-methylumbelliferone (Sigma). Chitinase extracted from Serratia marcescens (Sigma) was used as a positive control. Cytokine and Chemokine ELISA—Immunosandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits for IL-6, MCP-1/CCL2, IL-8/CXCL8, and TARC/CCL17 were used according to the manufacturer's instructions (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Statistics—All data were initially checked for normal/parametric distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). If parametric distribution was found, analysis of variance was applied to screen for differences among at least three groups. To compare two individual groups, Student's t test was applied. If nonparametric distribution was found, the Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to screen for differences among at least three groups, followed by the Mann-Whitney U test (Wilcoxon rank sum test) to compare two individual groups. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 4.0 (Graph Pad Software) and STATA version 8.2 for Windows (STATA Corp.) according to the approach described in Ref. 25Motulsky H. Intuitive Biostatistics. Oxford University Press, New York1995Google Scholar. AMCase, EGFR, and ADAM17 Are Induced and Co-localize in Vivo at Sites of Th2 and Th2-Cytokine-mediated Airway Inflammation—To characterize and quantify intracellular AMCase expression in lung epithelial cells in vivo, we established a flow cytometric epithelial evaluation method based on light scatter parameters, negative expression of CD45, negative expression of CD31, and positive expression of cytokeratin (Fig. 1). Using this method, we successfully compared the levels of intracellular AMCase in lung epithelial cells from control mice, mice sensitized and challenged with OVA, and IL-13-overexpressing transgenic animals. These studies demonstrated a significant increase in intracellular AMCase in both of the modeling systems (Fig. 2, a–d). The increase in intracellular AMCase in these Th2 inflammation/asthma models was paralleled by an increase of total EGFR in lung lysates (Fig. 3a) as well as specific EGFR surface expression on lung epithelial cells as analyzed by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 3b) and flow cytometry (Fig. 3, c and d). Using confocal microscopy, AMCase and EGFR were found to co-localize in lung epithelial cells of lungs of IL-13 transgenic and OVA-sensitized and -challenged mice (Fig. 3e) (data not shown).FIGURE 2Th2 airway inflammation increases AMCase expression in lung epithelial cells.

https://openalex.org/W2046009879,"Bcl-xL, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member protein, contributes to the resistance against chemotherapies such as tubulin-binder treatment in many human tumors. Although Bcl-xL is phosphorylated after tubulin-binder treatment, the role of the phosphorylation and its responsible kinase(s) are poorly understood. Here, we identified Plk1 (polo-like kinase 1) as a Bcl-xL kinase. Same location of Bcl-xL and Plk1 was revealed by immunocytochemical analyses at M-phase in situ. Plk1 phosphorylates Bcl-xL in vitro, and we identified Plk1 phosphorylation sites in Bcl-xL. When all of these phosphorylation sites were substituted to alanines, the anti-apoptotic activity of the Bcl-xL mutant against the apoptosis induced by pironetin, but not against ultraviolet-induced apoptosis, was increased. These observations suggest that Plk1 is a regulator of Bcl-xL phosphorylation and controls the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-xL during pironetin-induced apoptosis."

However, more recent work using mutational analysis coupled with fluorescence resonance energy transfer between ECFP-HSL and EYFP-AFABP/aP2 has established that for interaction to occur AFABP/aP2 must have an FFA bound and HSL must be in its activated phosphorylated form suggesting that the interaction may be regulatory leading to inhibition of lipase activity or influencing complex formation on the lipid droplet surface (11Smith A.J.

The site of AFABP/aP2 interaction on HSL has been mapped via a combination of mutagenesis and truncation analysis to a region bounded by amino acids 193-199 containing the core sequence EHYKRNE (10Shen W.J.

In contrast, the site of interaction on AFABP/aP2 that binds to HSL has not been mapped previously. The requirement for HSL to be in its phosphorylated form and AFABP/aP2 to have a lipid bound makes in vitro assessment of the interaction sites technically difficult. As such, we have turned to in situ methods involving mutational analysis coupled with energy transfer to map the interaction domain on AFABP/aP2. In this report we present studies defining the site of HSL interaction on AFABP/aP2 as two ion pairs linking Asp17 to Lys21 and Asp18 to Arg30. This cluster of residues on helix α1 and helix α2 are defined as a “charge quartet” and is conserved in the heart and epithelial FABPs that also associate with HSL but not in the intestinal or liver FABP (12Banaszak L. Winter N. Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan S. Jones T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 89-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that do not associate with HSL. The charge quartet, components of which have previously been suggested to be a nuclear localization sequence (13Gillilan R.E. Ayers S.D. Noy N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 1246-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), is likely to represent a protein-protein interaction motif linking AFABP/aP2 to the regulation of a variety of cellular proteins involved in lipid metabolism and homeostasis.

BODIPY D 3835 (4,4-difluoro-5-(2-thienyl)-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-dodecanoic acid), referred to as BODIPY-C12, was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). pEYFP-C1 and pECFP-C1 were obtained from Clontech.

To evaluate the interaction of ECFP-HSL with FABPs other than AFABP/aP2, epithelial FABP (EFABP), heart FABP (HFABP), intestinal FABP (IFABP), and liver FABP (LFABP) were subcloned into A206K pEYFP-C1 (14Smith A.J.

Briefly C8PA cells are HEK-293 fibroblasts stably expressing fatty acid transport protein 1 and perilipin A grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. C8PA cells transfected for FRET analysis were grown on polylysine-coated 13-mm coverslips in 12-well plates and transfected 24 h later with the expression plasmids specific for ECFP-HSL and/or EYFP-FABP (native or mutant). 24 h later the cells were lipid-loaded for 48 h with 300 μm oleic acid, 100 μm bovine serum albumin. Essentially identical results were obtained when cells are loaded with linoleic acid (data not shown). Lipolytic conditions were initiated by the addition of 20 μm forskolin, and digital images were captured between 2 and 4 h later. During microscopy, cells were kept in medium at 37 °C with 5% CO2 until imaging at room temperature. Normalized FRET (NFRET) Analysis—Images were captured, and real time FRET measurements were performed and calculated as previously reported where a complete description of the methods and data analysis is provided (11Smith A.J.

Image acquisition and measurement of three types of samples were carried out on each experiment for FRET index measurements as follows: one sample with cells expressing only the donor fluorophore to evaluate the donor bleed-through coefficient, one sample with cells expressing only the acceptor fluorophore to evaluate the acceptor bleed-through coefficient, and one sample with cells co-expressing the two fluorophores in which FRET signals were measured as described in Hachet-Haas et al.

For statistical analysis, each FRET experiment was done at least three independent times. In each experiment, cells were evaluated visually to identify typical expression patterns and to assess general transfection efficiency for each of the two fusion proteins. Monolayers of co-transfected cells were scanned using the individual EYFP and ECFP channels to identify those cells where the expression of the two reporters was comparable. Multiple fields were considered for each experiment with at least five separate cell fields assessed for localization and fluorescence measurements. Data presented in Figs. 4 and 9 represent combined results from all experiments addressing fluorescence from 15-20 cells.FIGURE 9NFRET values representing relative energy transfer between ECFP-HSL and EYFP-linked fatty acid-binding proteins.

Areas of a cell containing these aggregates were avoided when capturing images to be used for the comparative basal measurements. The forskolin-treated cells, however, were measured in the areas of HSL translocation, including any aggregates present in that area. Expression, Purification, and Ligand Binding Analysis of His-tagged Native and Mutant Forms of AFABP/aP2—Escherichia coli BL21 DE3 pLysS cells were transformed with a plasmid encoding His-tagged native AFABP/aP2 or the indicated mutants as described previously (18Jenkins-Kruchten A.E.

Cultures were grown, and expression of the protein was induced with 1 mm isopropyl thiogalactoside for 4 h. Following centrifugation, the cells were lysed in a French press and sonicated, and the soluble proteins were recovered following centrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g. The His-tagged AFABP/aP2 proteins were purified on a nickel affinity column and eluted with 250 mm imidazole. The pooled eluate was subjected to Lipidx chromatography to remove any bound ligand and subsequently dialyzed into 25 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) buffer. The purified FABPs were verified by SDS-PAGE and quantified spectrophotometrically. Fluorescence binding assays were performed using the probe 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid as described previously (19Kane C.D. Bernlohr D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 233: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly 1,8-ANS was dissolved in absolute ethanol and then diluted with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 5 μm (final ethanol concentration of 0.05%). For each assay, 500 μl of 1,8-ANS was mixed with increasing amounts of AFABP/aP2, and fluorescence was measured using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 650-10S fluorescence spectrophotometer. Scatchard analyses were performed to calculate dissociation constants. In a previous report we described studies that established that a fatty acid must be bound to AFABP/aP2 for association with HSL and that at least one amino acid, Lys21, was required for complex formation (11Smith A.J. Thompson B.R. Sanders M.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32424-32432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In those studies, EYFP-AFABP/aP2-K21I did not exhibit FRET with ECFP-HSL, whereas EYFP-AFABP/aP2-K31I did, implying that a region on or about Lys21 of helix α1 comprises a component of the HSL binding site. As shown in Fig. 1, the side chain of Lys21 is found within a cluster of charged residues demarcated by Asp17, Asp18, Lys21, Arg30, and Lys31. Although Asp17, Asp18, and Lys21 reside on helix α1, Arg30 and Lys31 are found on helix α2 in close proximity with the hydrocarbon chain of a bound fatty acid. Analysis of crystal coordinates (20Xu Z.H. Buelt M.K. Banaszak L.J. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14367-14370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that the side chain of Asp18 forms an ion pair with that of Lys21, whereas the side chain of Asp17 forms a salt bridge to that of Arg30, forming a quartet of charges that bridge the two helices. The observation that AFABP/aP2-K21I exhibits native fatty acid binding activity but does not physically bind to HSL points toward some unique features of Lys21 that could provide an explanation for why fatty acid binding is required for interaction with HSL. Xu et al. (20Xu Z.H. Buelt M.K. Banaszak L.J. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14367-14370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that Lys21 is one of the few residues whose main chain atoms vary in position with fatty acid binding, and LiCata and Bernlohr (21LiCata V.J. Bernlohr D.A. Proteins. 1998; 33: 577-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), using computational methods to assess the accessible surface area for each of the AFABP/aP2 side chains in both the apo- and holoforms, identified Asp18 and Lys21 as residues with significantly decreased surface accessibility in the holoform. To assess the involvement of the various residues of the proposed AFABP/aP2-HSL binding site, AFABP/aP2 residues Asn15 through Val23 as well as Arg30 were sequentially changed to alanine mutants in the A206K pEYFP-C1 vector, and FRET analysis was performed between each of the mutant proteins and ECFP-HSL. Our previous studies using C8PA lipocytes (HEK-293 cells stably transfected with fatty acid transport protein 1 and perilipin A) have demonstrated that physical association between ECFP-HSL and EYFP-AFABP/aP2 occurs in the cytoplasm under basal conditions and is markedly increased in response to forskolin treatment (11Smith A.J.

Each alanine mutant fusion protein was analyzed for fluorescence energy transfer with native ECFP-HSL. Additionally because all FRET images were collected using the same acquisition settings, we were able to determine the NFRET value for HSL association with AFABP/aP2 or each mutant AFABP/aP2 protein and compare them quantitatively. Fig. 3 shows the FRET images for each of these determinations. The resulting relative values of NFRET are presented in Fig. 4 and allow each AFABP/aP2 form to be compared under both basal and lipolytic conditions. From these images and the NFRET data Asp17, Asp18, Lys21, and Arg30 were identified as the most critical residues for the binding of AFABP/aP2 to HSL. Interestingly EYFP-AFABP/aP2-E22A did not translocate to the droplet surface suggesting that this protein associates with HSL but may affect complex formation. Because our prior work had established that a fatty acid must be bound to AFABP/aP2 to form a complex with HSL (11Smith A.J. Thompson B.R. Sanders M.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32424-32432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), we assessed the ligand binding activity of each mutant using the surrogate ligand 1,8-ANS. As shown in Fig. 5, although there were some differences in binding affinity, each of the alanine mutants retained fatty acid binding capacity similar to that of native AFABP/aP2. In contrast AFABP/aP2-R126Q exhibited essentially no 1,8-ANS binding and did not demonstrate energy transfer in FRET analysis with ECFP-HSL (11Smith A.J. Thompson B.R. Sanders M.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32424-32432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The helix-turn-helix domain of AFABP/aP2 has been shown in some, but not all, x-ray crystal structures to be a site for homodimerization. Indeed Gillilan et al. (13Gillilan R.E. Ayers S.D. Noy N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 1246-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) have reported that AFABP/aP2 is dimeric and, depending upon the ligand, may associate via a region encompassing the helical domain. Fig. 6 shows a sequence comparison of various FABPs with HSL and reveals that the helical region containing the charge quartet on AFABP/aP2 has some similarity to the corresponding binding site on HSL that has been identified previously (10Shen W.J. Liang Y. Hong R. Patel S. Natu V. Sridhar K. Jenkins A. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49443-49448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Of particular note are HSL Glu193 and Lys196. Although there is no x-ray or NMR structure determined for HSL, secondary structure algorithms predict that this segment of sequence would be in a helical conformation. This raises the possibility that the helical region on AFABP/aP2 interacts with a similar helical domain on HSL and that the intramolecular ion pair between Asp18 and Lys21 of AFABP/aP2 may form two intermolecular ion pairs with HSL: Asp18 of AFABP/aP2 with Lys196 of HSL and Lys21 of AFABP/aP2 with Glu193 of HSL. To test this hypothesis we carried out a charge reversal experiment. In this experiment, the EYFP-AFABP/aP2-D18K and the ECFP-HSL-K196E mutants were utilized. As shown in Fig. 7 EYFP-AFABP/aP2-D18K did not undergo significant energy transfer when co-expressed with ECFP-HSL, and conversely ECFP-HSL-K196E exhibited markedly reduced FRET when co-expressed with EYFP-AFABP/aP2. However, co-transfection of pEYFP-AFABP/aP2-D18K with the charge reversal mutant pECFP-HSL-K196E rescued energy transfer between the expressed fusion proteins to a level similar to that of the native controls. Fig. 4 provides the NFRET values obtained from these co-transfection experiments. These results indicate that during lipolytic stimulation AFABP/aP2 and HSL directly bind to each other. These results are consistent with previous titration microcalorimetry studies that had indicated a 1:1 molar stoichiometry of binding between the two proteins (18Jenkins-Kruchten A.E.

Moreover the region of sequence similarity between AFABP/aP2 and HSL likely represents an interaction domain linking the charge quartet of AFABP/aP2 to a similar region on HSL.FIGURE 7Energy transfer between ECFP-HSL and EYFP-AFABP/aP2 charge reversal mutants. C8PA lipocytes were co-transfected with pECFP-HSL and pEYFP-AFABP/aP2 or the indicated mutant forms and incubated with oleate-bovine serum albumin (3:1).

In this family, spatial alignment of the α carbon backbones of the proteins are virtually superimposable, whereas the primary sequence varies considerably from 20 to 70% sequence identity (12Banaszak L. Winter N. Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan S. Jones T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 89-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Storch J. Corsico B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2008; 28: 73-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Given the definition of Asp17, Asp18, Lys21, and Arg30 as primary determinants of HSL binding for AFABP/aP2, we assessed four other FABPs that have similar sequences in that region. To accomplish this epithelial FABP, heart FABP, intestinal FABP, and liver FABP were cloned into the A206K pEYFP-C1 vector, and the fluorescent fusion proteins were evaluated for binding with ECFP-HSL using FRET analyses. As shown in Figs. 8 and 9, EYFP-EFABP and EYFP-HFABP, but not EYFP-LFABP or EYFP-IFABP, exhibited energy transfer when co-expressed with ECFP-HSL with NFRET values similar to that for EYFP-AFABP/aP2. Fig. 6 shows the sequence comparison in the helical regions of the various FABPs and reveals that each of the proteins that associate with HSL contain acidic functions at positions 17 and 18 (relative to AFABP/aP2 numbering), a Lys residue at position 21 and an Arg residue at position 30. Intestinal FABP has a basic residue at position 18 and an acidic residue at position 21, whereas liver FABP contains a proline at position 18 and an isoleucine at position 30. Previous work detailing the molecular and physiological interaction between AFABP/aP2 and HSL has centered upon the following components. 1) The site with which AFABP/aP2 interacts on HSL has been defined from amino acids 190 to 200 in an N-terminal docking domain discrete from the C-terminal catalytic esterase domain (10Shen W.J. Liang Y. Hong R. Patel S. Natu V. Sridhar K. Jenkins A. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49443-49448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). 2) AFABP/aP2 must have a fatty acid bound to interact with HSL (11Smith A.J. Thompson B.R. Sanders M.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32424-32432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar); mutation of the critical arginine residue that forms part of the H-bonding network (Arg126) to a non-H-bonding glutamine renders the protein unable to bind FFA (25Storch J. Corsico B. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2008; 28: 73-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) or HSL (12Banaszak L. Winter N. Xu Z. Bernlohr D.A. Cowan S. Jones T.A. Adv. Protein Chem. 1994; 45: 89-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 3) The interaction forms a 1:1 complex between AFABP/aP2 and HSL (18Jenkins-Kruchten A.E. Bennaars-Eiden A. Ross J.R. Shen W.J.

Loss of AFABP/aP2 (AFABP/aP2-null mice) results in adipocytes with 4) an increase in intracellular FFA without activation of inflammatory pathways (26Makowski L. Boord J.B. Maeda K. Babaev V.R.

Med. 2001; 7: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) and 5) a decrease in the efflux of FFA from the adipocyte both in situ and in vivo (7Baar R.A. Dingfelder C.S. Smith L.A.

Despite the broad information base, the binding site on AFABP/aP2 that forms the cognate interaction domain with HSL has not been defined; this report addresses that identification. Using a mutagenesis strategy in combination with fluorescence resonance energy transfer, a quartet of charges in the helix-turn-helix domain of AFABP/aP2 defined by Asp17, Asp18, Lys21, and Arg30 were identified. Examination of the AFABP/aP2 apo- and holostructures revealed that within this quartet salt bonds are formed between Asp17 and Arg30 as well as between Asp18 and Lys21 (Fig. 1). Mutagenesis of any of these four residues and subsequent analysis via FRET revealed that these mutant AFABP/aP2 forms exhibited greatly diminished interaction with HSL. The interaction is specific to these residues because mutagenesis of surrounding amino acids did not affect AFABP/aP2-HSL interaction. Included in this analysis was Lys31, a spatially adjacent residue that when mutated to alanine had no affect on HSL interaction (11Smith A.J. Thompson B.R. Sanders M.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 32424-32432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) indicating that the association was not purely controlled by AFABP/aP2 electrostatics but required defined charges in a spatially concise configuration. Importantly mutagenesis of any of the quartet charges had little effect on fatty acid binding (Fig. 5) indicating that the binding determinant for HSL interaction is distinct and separable from the interaction of FFA with AFABP/aP2 and that mutants can be identified that define physical interaction with either fatty acids (e.g. R126Q), protein (e.g. D18A), or membrane phospholipids (K31I). Previous work by LiCata and Bernlohr (21LiCata V.J. Bernlohr D.A. Proteins. 1998; 33: 577-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) analyzed the apo- and holoprotein structure of AFABP/aP2 and concluded that significant changes in the accessible surface area of the protein occur upon ligand binding. Of the residues that had side chains influenced by fatty acid binding, Asp17 exhibited a decrease in accessibility for several fatty acids evaluated. In contrast, both Asp18 and Lys21 demonstrated ligand-dependent changes in accessible surface area with some fatty acids increasing and others decreasing accessibility. In contrast, Arg30 did not exhibit major structural changes in response to ligand binding. These results imply a ligand-dependent change in the orientation of helix α1, particularly in the Asp18-Lys21 salt bond region. Using a combination of in situ (FRET) (14Smith A.J. Sanders M.A. Thompson B.R. Londos C. Kraemer F.B. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 52399-52405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and in vitro (titration microcalorimetry) (18Jenkins-Kruchten A.E. Bennaars-Eiden A. Ross J.R. Shen W.J. Kraemer F.B. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47636-47643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) analyses, several other, but not all, FABPs were shown to interact with HSL. Other interacting fatty acid-binding proteins include epithelial FABP and heart FABP (Fig. 8), whereas liver FABP and intestinal FABP exhibited reduced association. Comparison of the sequences in and around the helical domain of each FABP showed a consensus alignment for the binding site as F-Acidic-Acidic-YMKX2GVG (Fig. 6). Each of AFABP/aP2, EFABP, and HFABP contain this domain, whereas non-binding IFABP and LFABP forms do not, supporting the finding that this region defines the interaction region. Other FABPs that contain the binding motif but have not been evaluated for HSL association are testis and myelin FABP. As shown in Fig. 6, the sequence of HSL from amino acids 190 to 201 also contains many of the basic core elements of the FABP interaction site. The HSL sequence FGEHYKRNETG represents a modified version of the core FABP element and the prediction that in HSL this region forms a helical interaction partner with AFABP/aP2 allowing for the acidic residue on AFABP/aP2 (Asp18) to interact with the Lys196 on HSL and Lys21 of AFABP/aP2 to ion pair with a cognate Glu193 residue on HSL. Consistent with this, Figs. 4 and 7 show that when Asp18 is mutated to a lysine residue the interaction with HSL was lost but could be rescued when the corresponding basic residue of HSL (Lys196) was converted to a glutamic acid. Although not evaluated, the extension of this is that mutation of AFABP/aP2 Lys21 to Glu would result in loss of interaction with HSL but could be restored by corresponding mutation of HSL Glu193 to Lys. This finding predicts that other FABP partners would also contain the interaction motif. Work by Liou and Storch (27Liou H.L. Storch J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6475-6485Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) has shown that AFABP/aP2 (and several other FABPs) donates a bound fatty acid to membranes via a collisional mechanism that requires Lys21 and Lys31. The studies herein indicated that Lys21, but not Lys31, was required for HSL interaction implying that the protein-protein interaction site overlaps with the protein-lipid interface and shares several common determinants. The structure of AFABP/aP2 (Fig. 1) shows that Lys31 is very close to Lys21 but does not form salt bonds with an adjacent amino acid. Indeed K31I served as a negative control in FRET experiments and indicates that this residue may be a discriminating factor in defining protein-protein association versus lipid trafficking. The region on AFABP/aP2 identified as the HSL binding site overlaps with a domain suggested by Gillilan et al. (13Gillilan R.E. Ayers S.D. Noy N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 1246-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) to be part of a nuclear localization domain involving Lys21, Arg30, and Lys31. Mutagenesis analysis of several EYFP-AFABP/aP2 fusions revealed that none of the residues affected intracellular localization when expressed into HEK-293 cells: AFABP/aP2 was found ubiquitously throughout the cell. However, in the studies of Gillilan et al. (13Gillilan R.E. Ayers S.D. Noy N. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 1246-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) the location of AFABP/aP2 in COS-7 cells was dependent upon such residues suggesting that cell-specific factors may be determining influences for localization rather than being an intrinsic property of the protein itself. Indeed in prior work we have shown in 3T3-L1 cells that early in the differentiation program (days 4-6 in the standard protocol) AFABP/aP2 is largely nuclear, whereas later (days 12-16) the protein is also found cytoplasmically (28Helledie T. Antonius M. Sorensen R.V. Hertzel A.V. Bernlohr D.A. Kolvraa S. Kristiansen K. Mandrup S. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1740-1751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given our observation that Lys21 and Arg30 are central to HSL association, translocation may represent interaction with nuclear proteins with a similar targeting sequence. In summary, this work presents for the first time the binding site on AFABP/aP2 for HSL and suggests that association with other proteins may involve the same domain. Because the interaction with HSL requires that a fatty acid be bound to AFABP/aP2 the association is considered to be regulatory, serving as a potential negative feedback loop regulating lipid hydrolysis. Current studies are underway to evaluate this proposal. We thank the members of the Bernlohr laboratory for helpful suggestions and comments during the development of this manuscript."

This process is mediated by secretory granule exocytosis. However, how β-cells keep granule stores relatively constant is still unknown. ICA512 is an intrinsic granule membrane protein, whose cytosolic domain binds β2-syntrophin, an F-actin-associated protein, and is cleaved upon granule exocytosis. The resulting cleaved cytosolic fragment, ICA512-CCF, reaches the nucleus and up-regulates the transcription of granule genes, including insulin and ICA512. Here, we show that ICA512-CCF also dimerizes with intact ICA512 on granules, thereby displacing it from β2-syntrophin. This leads to increased granule mobility and insulin release. Based on these findings, we propose a model whereby the generation of ICA512-CCF first amplifies insulin secretion. The ensuing reduction of granule stores would then increase the probability of newly generated ICA512-CCF to reach the nucleus and enhance granule biogenesis, thus allowing β-cells to constantly adjust production of granules to their storage size and consumption.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4013-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of secretory granules triggers the transient insertion of ICA512-TMF into the plasma membrane (22Solimena M. Dirkx Jr., R. Hermel J.M. Pleasic-Williams S. Shapiro J.A. Caron L. Rabin D.U. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2102-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and its intracellular cleavage by the Ca2+-activated protease calpain-1 (17Ort T. Voronov S. Guo J. Zawalich K. Froehner S.C. Zawalich W. Solimena M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4013-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The resulting cleaved cytosolic fragment (ICA512-CCF; residues 659-979) contains the decoy protein-tyrosine phosphatase module flanked by two regions that bind to the PDZ domain of β2-syntrophin (supplemental Fig. 1A). ICA512-CCF is targeted to the nucleus, where it enhances the transcription of insulin and other granule genes as well as β-cell proliferation (25Mziaut H. Kersting S. Knoch K.P. Fan W.H.

Accordingly, ICA512-/- mice display reduced insulin secretion, glucose intolerance, and impaired regeneration of β-cells (25Mziaut H. Kersting S. Knoch K.P. Fan W.H. Trajkovski M. Erdmann K.

Moreover, overexpression of ICA512 in mouse insulinoma MIN6 cells increases the number of granules as well as the content, half-life, and stimulated secretion of insulin (29Harashima S. Clark A.

INS-r3 cells expressing the reverse tetracycline-dependent trans-activator were transiently transfected with ICA512-CCF-GFP in the tetracycline-tk-luc-derived plasmid. Expression of ICA512-CCF-GFP was induced by exposure to 500 ng/ml doxycycline for 16, 24, 36, or 48 h.

Beads were washed 10 times with binding buffer and eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione. Eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography.Immunocytochemistry—Labeling of transfected or nontransfected INS-1E cells was performed as described (27Trajkovski M.

The following primary and secondary antibodies were used: mouse anti-insulin (Sigma), rabbit anti-TGN38 (BD Transduction Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ), Alexa568-conjugated goat anti-mouse or Alexa488-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgGs and phalloidin-rhodamine (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma), and coverslips were mounted with Mowiol (Calbiochem). Images of 0.5-μm optical sections were acquired at room temperature with an inverted confocal microscope Zeiss Axiovert 200M equipped with a Plan-Apochromat ×63 oil objective, numerical aperture 1.4, a Zeiss LSM510 scan head with photomultiplier tubes, and the software Zeiss LSM 510 AIM version 4 (Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany).RNA Interference—For knockdown of rat ICA512 and β2-syntrophin, the following oligonucleotides were used to generate silencing hairpin in the pGENE-CLIP U1 cassette system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions: ICA512 short hairpin RNA oligo1, 5′-TCTCGCGCCATCATTCGAAACAATTCAAGAGATTGTTTCGAATGATGGCGCCT-3′; ICA512 short hairpin RNA oligo2, 5′-TCTCGCAGTACAAGCAGATGTAATTCAAGAGATTACATCTGCTTGTACTGCCT-3′, as previously described (25Mziaut H.

Single or double transfections of INS-1E cells with pGENE-ICA512 and pGENE-β2-syntrophin by electroporation were performed as described (27Trajkovski M. Mziaut H. Altkruger A. Ouwendijk J. Knoch K.P. Muller S. Solimena M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), using 4 or 3 μg of each plasmid for single or double transfection, respectively. Cells were stimulated and harvested 4 days after transfection, and knockdown of ICA512 and β2-syntrophin was determined by real time PCR and Western blot, as described (27Trajkovski M. Mziaut H. Altkruger A. Ouwendijk J. Knoch K.P. Muller S. Solimena M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Insulin Radioimmune Assay—Insulin secretion was assessed as a ratio between insulin in the medium and the cell insulin content. After stimulation, 25-30 purified pancreatic islets were resuspended in fresh resting or stimulating medium and sonicated for 4 min. INS-1E cells were extracted overnight in 3:1:0.06 volumes of ethanol, H2O, and 37% HCl at -20 °C. Following centrifugation, insulin in islet cells and in the medium was measured with the Sensitive Rat Insulin RIA kit (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). The insulin stimulation index was calculated as follows: secreted/total insulin in stimulated conditions versus secreted/total insulin in resting conditions.Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM)—Images of INS-1 cells stably expressing mouse CgB-mRFP1 were acquired with a Roper Scientific MicroMAX512BFT charge-coupled device camera with a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope equipped with an argon laser and a Zeiss ×100/1.45 numerical aperture Plan-FLUAR objective and a ×1.6 optovar. The microscope was outfitted with a dual port total internal reflection fluorescence condenser (Till Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany). Prior to imaging, cells grown in an open chamber were incubated in resting media and transferred onto a thermostat-controlled (37 °C) stage. CgB-mRFP1+ granules in GFP+ cells were visualized by excitation of mRFP1 at 488 nm using filter sets for tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate emission (Chroma Technology Corp., Rockingham, VT). Images were collected using the software MetaMorph (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at the speed of 2 frames/s with an exposure time of 100 ms, for a total of 4 min (480 frames) for each movie (supplemental Movies 1 and 2). Automated image analysis was performed with the MotionTracking/Kalaimoscope software (Transinsight GmbH, Dresden, Germany), as described (38Rink J. Ghigo E. Kalaidzidis Y. Zerial M. Cell. 2005; 122: 735-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). The background of nonvesicular fluorescence was subtracted, and the granules were fitted by analytical function as described (38Rink J. Ghigo E. Kalaidzidis Y. Zerial M. Cell. 2005; 122: 735-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar). The accuracy of granule center definition was estimated from the mean square displacement (i.e. the average of squared displacements) and found equal to 60 nm. The jitter of center definition was suppressed by smoothing the tracks with a sliding window (±2 frames). Statistical data for granule density were obtained from 10 films. The total number of tracked CgB-mRFP1+ granules in GFP+ and ICA512-CCF-GFP+ cells was 779 and 888, respectively. Speed was measured between every two sequential frames, and the total number of speed measurements in GFP+ and ICA512-CCF-GFP+ cells was 13,332 and 14,828, respectively.Statistics and Graphics—Statistical analyses were performed as previously described (26Mziaut H. Trajkovski M. Kersting S. Ehninger A. Altkruger A. Lemaitre R.P. Schmidt D. Saeger H.D. Lee M.S. Drechsel D.N. Muller S. Solimena M. Nat.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The error bars show S.D. values from at least three independent experiments. Histograms were prepared with Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).RESULTSICA512 Cleavage Regulates Exocytosis—We used several approaches to test whether the calpain-mediated cleavage of ICA512-TMF affects insulin secretion from INS-1E cells stimulated with 25 mm glucose (HG) and 55 mm KCl (HK). INS-1E cells were used, since they respond better to glucose than the parental INS-1 cells (31Merglen A. Theander S. Rubi B. Chaffard G. Wollheim C.B. Maechler P. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). First, ICA512-TMF cleavage was prevented with the calpain inhibitor calpeptin. As shown for INS-1 cells, calpeptin reduced the cleavage of ICA512-TMF in INS-1E cells by ∼70% (17Ort T. Voronov S. Guo J. Zawalich K. Froehner S.C. Zawalich W. Solimena M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4013-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Trajkovski M. Mziaut H. Altkruger A. Ouwendijk J. Knoch K.P. Muller S. Solimena M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1B). Calpeptin also inhibited insulin release from HGHK-stimulated mouse pancreatic islets and INS-1E cells (Fig. 1, A and B).To test if this reduction resulted from the diminished cleavage of ICA512-TMF, we analyzed insulin secretion from ICA512-/- islets. Consistent with previous studies, the insulin stimulation index (SI) of untreated islets from ICA512-/- mice was 58 ± 8.7% lower than in ICA512+/+ islets (28Saeki K. Zhu M. Kubosaki A. Xie J. Lan M.S. Notkins A.L. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1842-1850Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Strikingly, calpeptin did not further decrease insulin secretion from ICA512-/- islets, indicating that calpain-1-mediated cleavage of ICA512-TMF regulates insulin secretion (Fig. 1A). Accordingly, both transient and stable overexpression of ICA512-GFP in INS-1E cells enhanced insulin release in a dose-dependent and calpeptin-sensitive fashion (Fig. 1B).Next, we investigated whether cleavage of ICA512-TMF affects insulin secretion by promoting insulin gene expression and granule biogenesis. Block of protein synthesis with 100 μm cycloheximide did not prevent calpeptin from inhibiting stimulated insulin release (Fig. 1C). Depolarization of β-cells with HK alone triggers Ca2+ entry, granule exocytosis, and cleavage of ICA512-TMF (17Ort T. Voronov S. Guo J. Zawalich K. Froehner S.C. Zawalich W. Solimena M.

https://openalex.org/W1976120524,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecules and play a vital role in promoting an immune response against invading microbes. TLR2, one of the key members of the TLR family, recognizes a wide variety of microbial products, including lipoproteins and lipopeptides, from a number of pathogens. Recent studies from our laboratory indicate that glycopeptidolipids (GPLs), a major surface component of Mycobacterium avium and other non-tuberculosis mycobacteria, are ligands for TLR2. However, the molecular requirements necessary for the GPL-TLR2 interaction were not defined in this report. In the present study we isolated different GPL species from M. avium, and using mass spectrometry and NMR analyses, characterized the molecular requirements of the GPL-TLR2 interaction. Interestingly, the extent of the respective acetylation and methylation of the 6-deoxytalose and rhamnose contained within the core GPL structure dictated whether the GPL signaled through TLR2. These experiments illustrate how subtle changes in a complex TLR2 ligand can alter its affinity for this important receptor, and suggest that M. avium could potentially modify its GPL structure to limit its interaction with TLR2.

In mice there are 11 members of the TLR family that recognize an array of structures, including unmethylated CpG DNA, flagellin, glycolipids, peptidoglycan, heat-shock proteins, taxol, among others (1Gay N.J. Gangloff M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 141-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, TLRs dimerize and couple to myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88), a common cytoplasmic adapter molecule required for TLR signaling, leading to the activation and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α. TLRs are therefore important in activating the innate immune system and instructing the development of the adaptive response upon recognition of the various pathogen-associated molecular patterns (2Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6751) Google Scholar). The pro-inflammatory responses elicited by TLR2 and TLR4 have been widely examined with respect to ligand recognition and signaling. TLR4 was originally characterized as the receptor that plays a pivotal role in enterobacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock (3Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6478) Google Scholar). TLR2 is also noteworthy as it is able to recognize an extremely diverse array of microbial products, such as lipoproteins and lipopeptides from different pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus (4Hashimoto M. Tawaratsumida K. Kariya H. Aoyama K. Tamura T. Suda Y. Int. Immunol. 2006; 18: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), Borrelia burgdorferi (5Hirschfeld M. Kirschning C.J. Schwandner R. Wesche H. Weis J.H. Wooten R.M. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2382-2386Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and Mycoplasma fermentans (6Lien E. Sellati T.J. Yoshimura A. Flo T.H. Rawadi G. Finberg R.W. Carroll J.D. Espevik T. Ingalls R.R. Radolf J.D. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33419-33425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Moreover, TLR2 has also been shown to respond to non-enterobacterial LPS (7Erridge C. Pridmore A. Eley A. Stewart J. Poxton I.R. J. Med. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). TLR2 is able to form heterodimers with TLR1 or TLR6, further expanding the repertoire of bacterial products that it can recognize (8Farhat K. Riekenberg S. Heine H. Debarry J. Lang R. Mages J.

Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). The importance of TLR-mediated responses during M. tuberculosis infections has been extensively examined. Fenton and colleagues (11Means T.K. Wang S. Lien E. Yoshimura A. Golenbock D.T. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3920-3927Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) performed in vitro studies and observed that M. tuberculosis activated both TLR2 and TLR4, whereas heat-killed M. tuberculosis activated only TLR2. Similarly, macrophages expressing dominant negative TLR2 resulted in the inhibition of TNF-α production in response to both virulent and avirulent M. tuberculosis strains (12Underhill D.M. Ozinsky A. Smith K.D. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14459-14463Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Another study revealed that mice lacking TLR2 had increased bacterial load, developed chronic pneumonia, and succumbed to infection more readily, as compared with wild-type mice, when challenged with M. tuberculosis (13Drennan M.B. Nicolle D. Quesniaux V.J. Jacobs M. Allie N. Mpagi J. Fremond C. Wagner H. Kirschning C. Ryffel B. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 49-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). A role for TLRs has also been evaluated for M. avium, a major opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised patients and a significant cause of increased morbidity and mortality in patients with an advanced stage of AIDS (14Horsburgh Jr., C.R. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 179: S461-S465Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 15Horsburgh Jr., C.R. Havlik J.A. Ellis D.A. Kennedy E. Fann S.A. Dubois R.E. Thompson S.E. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1991; 144: 557-559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, in vitro and in vivo studies have implicated TLR2 in promoting an immune response following M. avium challenge. Lien et al. (6Lien E. Sellati T.J. Yoshimura A. Flo T.H. Rawadi G. Finberg R.W. Carroll J.D. Espevik T. Ingalls R.R. Radolf J.D. Golenbock D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33419-33425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) observed that TNF-α release from peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to M. avium was blocked when cells were pre-treated with a TLR2-specific antibody. Additionally, TLR2-deficient mice had increased bacterial loads compared with wild-type mice when challenged with a virulent strain of M. avium (16Gomes M.S. Florido M. Cordeiro J.V. Teixeira C.M. Takeuchi O. Akira S. Appelberg R. Immunology. 2004; 111: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Another study evaluated the response to M. avium infection in mice that were deficient in TLR2, TLR4, and MyD88. It was observed that MyD88- and TLR2-deficient mice had an increased bacterial load and increased susceptibility to M. avium infection, and failed to recruit neutrophils to the site of infection, as compared with TLR4-deficient and wild-type mice (17Feng C.G. Scanga C.A. Collazo-Custodio C.M. Cheever A.W. Hieny S. Caspar P. Sher A. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4758-4764Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These studies, together, highlight the importance of TLRs, particularly TLR2, in combating M. tuberculosis and M. avium infections. TLR2-, TLR4-, and TLR9-specific ligands produced by M. tuberculosis have been identified and include the 19-kDa lipoprotein, heat-shock protein 65, and mycobacterial DNA, respectively (18Brightbill H.D. Libraty D.H. Krutzik S.R. Yang R.B. Belisle J.T. Bleharski J.R. Maitland M. Norgard M.V. Plevy S.E. Smale S.T. Brennan P.J. Bloom B.R. Godowski P.J. Modlin R.L.

Chem. 2005; 280: 20961-20967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, the TLR ligands produced by other mycobacteria are less well defined. Recently, we showed that the surface-exposed glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) produced by M. avium can serve as TLR2 but not TLR4 ligands (21Sweet L. Schorey J.S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2006; 80: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). GPLs consist of a fatty acyl chain N-linked to a tripeptide-aminoalcohol core containing d-phenylalanine, d-allo-threonine, d-alanine, and l-alaninol. The allo-threonine is glycosidically linked to a 6-deoxy-α-l-talopyranosyl residue (6-deoxytalose), and the alaninol is glycosidically linked to a methylated α-l-rhamnopyranosyl residue (rhamnose). The structure of GPLs makes them unique TLR2 agonists since they essentially constitute a “mixture” of glycolipids and lipopeptides. Moreover, they contain only one N-linked fatty acid chain, thereby differing from other TLR2 (and TLR4) ligands, which usually contain multiple fatty acids of varying length that can be either O-linked or N-linked (7Erridge C. Pridmore A. Eley A. Stewart J. Poxton I.R. J. Med. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 735-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 22Hirschfeld M. Weis J.J. Toshchakov V. Salkowski C.A. Cody M.J. Ward D.C.

In the present study, we show that specific acetylation and methylation patterns of the 6-deoxytalose and rhamnose, respectively, which comprise the diglycosylated lipopeptide core of GPL, are required for GPL signaling through the macrophage TLR2. These results further illustrate the complexity and specificity of TLR2-ligand interactions and suggest that M. avium could potentially modify its GPL structure to limit its interaction with TLR2. Extraction and Purification of GPLs—M. avium strains 104 and 2151 were grown on Middlebrook 7H11 agar (Difco), and total lipids were extracted with a solution of chloroform:methanol (C:M, 2:1 v/v) as described in previous reports (21Sweet L. Schorey J.S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2006; 80: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 25Krzywinska E. Bhatnagar S. Sweet L. Chatterjee D. Schorey J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 1262-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). GPLs were purified by preparative TLC, using 10 cm × 20 cm Silica gel 60 plates (EMD Chemicals) that were loaded with 3–5 mg of total lipid and developed lengthwise. Nonspecific GPLs were purified using a C:M:H2O (90:10:1, v/v)-developing solvent, and serovar 2 GPLs were purified using a C:M:H2O (50:10:1, v/v)-developing solvent. Side strips were cut from the TLC plate and visualized with a solution of 1% α-naphthol (w/v)/5% sulfuric acid (v/v) in ethanol, and heating to 100 °C. Respective bands were scraped from the TLC plate, re-extracted from the scraped silica in C:M (2:1) overnight at 37 °C, and Folch-washed with endotoxin-free water. Purity of GPLs was checked by TLC using a developing solvent composed of C:M:H2O (50:10:1). Isolation and Cultivation of Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages—Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMΦs) were harvested from the bone marrow of 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/6 mice as described previously (26Yadav M. Roach S.K. Schorey J.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5588-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mature macrophages were harvested and stored at –140 °C. Thawed macrophages were cultured on non-tissue culture plates for 3–7 days, and after one passage, were re-plated on tissue-culture plastic at 3 × 105 cells/35-mm plate. GPL Deacetylation—Native total lipid and purified GPLs were deacetylated by a standard mild alkali treatment (27Brennan P.J. Heifets M. Ullom B.P. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1982; 15: 447-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, dried lipids were dissolved in one part C:M (2:1) and one part 0.2 n NaOH in methanol at a total volume of ∼6 ml per 50 mg or less of lipid, and incubated at 37 °C for 40 min. The solution was then neutralized with 2–3 drops of glacial acetic acid, dried down, Folch-washed as described above, dried down, and re-suspended at known concentrations. Sugar Analyses (GC/MS)—Purified native and deacetylated GPLs were subjected to a standard alditol acetate derivatization procedure where the GPL sugar moieties were hydrolyzed, reduced, and per-acetylated as described (21Sweet L. Schorey J.S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2006; 80: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Alditol acetates were dissolved in ∼20 μl of high-performance liquid chromatography-grade chloroform (Fisher), and then 1 μl of sample was injected into a Fisons Instruments 8035 gas chromatograph connected to a Fisons Instruments MD 800 quadrupole mass spectrometer. Derivatized sugars were separated on a 60 m × 0.25 mm ID column with a film thickness of 0.25 μm composed of 5% phenyl and 95% dimethylpolysiloxane (Zebron ZB5), using a temperature program beginning at 50 °C for 5 min and increasing to 250 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, and then holding the temperature at 250 °C for 15 min. Electron ionization mass spectra were acquired in the positive ionization mode in a scan range of 40–340 atomic mass units at a rate of 1 scan/s for the entire run time totaling at 40 min/run. GPL Exposure to BMMΦs—Native and deacetylated total lipid and purified GPLs were dissolved in high-performance liquid chromatography-grade methanol and directly applied to tissue-culture grade plastic at the indicated concentrations. The methanol was allowed to completely evaporate prior to adding BMMΦs, after which the cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for defined time periods. TNF-α Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay and Western Blots—TNF-α was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described (21Sweet L. Schorey J.S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2006; 80: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For Western blots, 10 μg of native and deacetylated total lipid and purified GPLs were exposed to 3 × 105 BMMΦs for 4 h. BMMΦs were then washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and treated for 10 min with ice-cold lysis buffer as previously described (26Yadav M. Roach S.K. Schorey J.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 5588-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein as determined by the MicroBCA protein assay (Pierce) were analyzed by Western blot for phosphorylated and total p38 and phosphorylated and total p65 NFκB (21Sweet L. Schorey J.S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2006; 80: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). ESI/MS and ESI/MS/MS Analyses—Purified native and deacetylated GPLs were dissolved in an high-performance liquid chromatography-grade solution of methanol:methylene chloride (2:1, v/v) and analyzed using a Micromass (Beverly, MA) Quattro-LC triple quadrupole (Q1q-Q3) instrument employing MassLynx 4.0 software. The Quattro-LC Z-spray interface was operated in the ESI mode with the following parameters: capillary voltage = 2.4–3.0 kV, cone voltage = 25–40 V, source temperature = 120–125 °C, desolvation temperature = 150 °C, and desolvation gas (N2) flow rate = 271–414 liters/h. For direct infusion experiments, a Harvard apparatus (Holliston, MA) syringe pump delivered samples at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. For MS/MS experiments, the mass spectrometer tune was optimized by directly infusing a solution of GPL dissolved in methanol:methylene chloride (2:1, v/v). Collisionally activated dissociation (CAD) was employed for all MS/MS experiments by admitting argon into the collision cell (q). For product ion scans, argon was admitted into q until the precursor signal intensity was reduced by ∼50%, then the collision energy (voltage offset between Q1 and Q3) was increased to 20–40 eV. MS/MS spectra were acquired in the multichannel acquisition mode of data acquisition at a rate of 400 atomic mass units/s. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were obtained at 22 °C on a Varian UNITYPlus FT-NMR spectrometer operating at 599.887 MHz for 1H. Samples were analyzed in 5-mm NMR tubes (Wilmad) at a concentration of ∼10 mm in CDCl3 solvent. Chemical shifts were referenced to the internal residual CHCl3 signal (7.270 ppm). 1H spectra were collected with a 7000-Hz spectral window and ∼5.0-s recycle time. Free induction decays were zero-filled to give final digital resolutions of <0.05 Hz/pt. The J-couplings are reported in hertz and are accurate to ±0.1 Hz unless otherwise indicated. The two-dimensional 1H-1H COSY spectra were obtained with a 6200-Hz spectral window and ∼2.0-s recycle time. 256 t1 increments of 16 scans each were sampled. Free induction decays were zero-filled to give 4K × 4K complex data sets that were Fourier-transformed with line broadening, sinebell, and/or Gaussian weighting functions in both domains. Two-dimensional rotating frame nuclear overhauser effect spectra were obtained with a 6200-Hz spectral window using a spin-lock mixing time of 200 ms, spin-lock field strength of 3731 Hz, and a relaxation delay of 2 s. 256 t1 increments of 64 scans each were sampled, and free induction decays were zero-filled to give 4K × 4K complex data sets. Data sets were Fourier-transformed with line broadening and Gaussian weighting functions in both domains, and a baseline correction was applied in the F2 domain. Isolation and Characterization of the Serovar 2 GPLs—Previously, we observed that some GPLs could activate BMMΦsina MyD88- and TLR2-dependent manner while other GPLs failed to induce activation (21Sweet L. Schorey J.S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2006; 80: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We found that the serovar 2 GPL from M. avium 2151 activated p38 and IκBα, and stimulated TNF-α production from BMMΦs in a MyD88- and TLR2-dependent manner (21Sweet L. Schorey J.S. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2006; 80: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, in this previous study no attempt was made to separate the potential variants of the serovar 2 GPL to define the specific structural requirements necessary for activity. In the present study we used a TLC solvent system that allowed for a more refined separation of the different serovar 2 GPL species. Using this system, which consisted of chloroform: methanol:water (50:10:1, v/v), we were able to isolate two variants of serovar 2 GPL, which we designated S2A and S2B. The difference in migration on the TLC plate was lost if the GPLs were treated with mild base to remove acetyl groups, suggesting that the difference between the two species was due to the number of acetyl groups (Fig. 1A). To confirm that S2A and S2B were both serovar 2 GPLs, the carbohydrate composition was analyzed by alditol acetate derivatization and GC/MS. GC/MS analyses confirmed the presence of the sugars expected in the serovar 2 GPL, including the 3,4-di-O-methylrhamnose (m/z 131, 190, and 234), 2,3-di-O-methylfucose (m/z 118, 143, and 203), 6-deoxytalose (m/z 129, 171, and 231), and the rhamnose (m/z 129, 171, and 231). Results were nearly identical for both S2A and S2B (only GC trace for S2B shown, Fig. 1B). These data together indicate that there are two species of the serovar 2 GPL produced by M. avium 2151, where the glycosylation and methylation patterns are identical as revealed by GC/MS analyses, but that both species are acetylated to different extents as indicated by the TLC data. Native but Not Deacetylated S2B GPL Stimulates Macrophage Activation—M. avium 2151 lipids were exposed to BMMΦs, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” where the BMMΦs were isolated from wild-type, MyD88–/–, and TLR2–/– C57BL/6 mice. The macrophages were exposed to native and deacetylated total lipid, S2A, S2B, methanol only (solvent control), or were left untreated. Culture supernatants were collected 24 h post-treatment and assayed for TNF-α production, and in separate experiments, cells were lysed 4 h post-treatment and assayed for p38 and NFκB phosphorylation. The results demonstrate that native total lipid and the S2B GPL induced TNF-α production in a dose-dependent manner, and that production was dependent on MyD88 and TLR2. Additionally, the ability of S2B to stimulate TNF-α production was abrogated upon deacetylation (Fig. 2A). In contrast, BMMΦs treated with native S2A produced minimal TNF-α (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, native S2B stimulated p38 and NFκB phosphorylation in a MyD88- and TLR2-dependent fashion, while native S2A failed to induce protein phosphorylation above what was observed in untreated cells (Fig. 2B). As predicted, deacetylation of the S2B GPL completely abrogated its ability to activate p38 and NFκB (Fig. 2B). The O-Acetyl Groups of the Serovar 2 GPLs Are Located on the 6-Deoxytalose—ESI mass spectra were obtained in the positive ion mode for both native and deacetylated S2A and S2B. The ESI mass spectrum of native S2A showed high abundance peaks at m/z 1561 and 1595, as well as minor peaks representing possible differences in acyl chain length (14-atomic mass unit intervals) or those with sodium adducts (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1A). At m/z 1477 and 1511, there was a downward shift of ∼84 atomic mass units compared with the respective native S2A peaks at m/z 1561 and 1595, suggesting a difference of two acetyl groups between the native and deacetylated S2A species (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1A). The positive ion mode ESI mass spectrum for native S2B showed major peaks at m/z 1519 and 1553, as well as other peaks representing sodiation at m/z 1541 [1519-H+Na]+ and m/z 1575 [1553-H+Na]+ (Table 1 and Fig. 3A). The ESI mass spectrum of deacetylated S2B had prominent peaks at m/z 1477 and 1511, representing a downward shift of 42 atomic mass units compared with peaks in the ESI mass spectrum of native S2B, suggesting the native species peaks each contained one acetyl group (Table 1 and Fig. 3A).TABLE 1Major intact GPL ions and product ions of S2A and S2B native (N) and de-acetylated (DA) species from ESI mass spectra and ESI production mass spectra, respectivelyIntact GPL ion m/z valuesProduct ion m/z valuesSugar moiety lostatomic mass unitsS2A (N)15611386, 1240, 1065, 835175, 146, 175, 23015951420, 1274, 1099, 869175, 146, 175, 230S2A (DA)14771302, 1156, 1010, 835175, 146, 146, 17515111336, 1190, 1044, 869175, 146, 146, 175S2B (N)15191344, 1198, 1023, 835175, 146, 175, 18815531378, 1232, 1057, 869175, 146, 175, 188S2B (DA)14771302, 1156, 1010, 835175, 146, 146, 17515111336, 1190, 1044, 869175, 146, 146, 175 Open table in a new tab To identify the location of the putative acetyl groups, product ion tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments were performed on each of the major GPL peaks by subjecting individually selected ions to undergo CAD at collision energies of 20, 30, and 40 eV. Product ion mass spectra from native and deacetylated species were then compared. At a collision energy of 20 eV, product ion mass spectra consistently showed a fragmentation pattern signifying the sequential loss of individual sugar moieties from the GPL ions. Five major peaks were observed in each product ion mass spectrum, where the peak with the highest m/z value represented the intact GPL ion, and the subsequent peaks denoted the ions with the loss of an individual sugar moiety. As shown in Table 1, the m/z values of intact ions are listed with the respective product ions resulting from CAD at 20 eV. The “sugar moieties lost” column represents the numerical difference between each of the m/z values of the prominent adjacent peaks and indicates the mass (atomic mass units) of each of the sugars released from the intact GPL ion upon CAD (Table 1). For example, when analyzing the biologically active major native S2B intact GPL ion at m/z 1553, there was a sequential loss of a dimethylated 6-deoxyhexose (175 atomic mass units; product ion m/z 1378), an unmodified 6-deoxyhexose (146 atomic mass units; product ion m/z 1232), another dimethylated 6-deoxyhexose (175 atomic mass units; product ion m/z 1057), and lastly, a diacetylated 6-deoxyhexose (188 atomic mass units; product ion m/z 869) (Table 1 and Fig. 3, A and B). When comparing these m/z values to those of deacetylated S2B, the masses of the lost sugar moieties were identical, except for one moiety loss of 146 atomic mass units, which represented another unmodified 6-deoxyhexose (Table 1 and Fig. 3B). These results were consistent for each of the intact GPL ions analyzed (data not shown). Because the acetylated sugar was repeatedly the last carbohydrate to fragment from the intact GPL protonated ion, we hypothesized that the acetyl group was located on the 6-deoxytalose as this is the only non-methylated sugar attached to the lipopeptide core. However, the exact position of the acetyl group could not be determined by MS/MS experiments alone (Fig. 3B). The same tandem MS experiments were performed to compare native non-active S2A with deacetylated S2A. Product ion mass spectra of intact GPL ions of native S2A consistently indicated the loss of two dimethylated 6-deoxyhexoses, representing the 3,4-di-O-methylrhamnose and 2,3-di-O-methylfucose (175 atomic mass units each), an unmodified 6-deoxyhexose (146 atomic mass units), and a diacetylated 6-deoxyhexose (230 atomic mass units) (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1B). The diacetylated sugar moiety was always the last component to fragment from the intact GPL protonated ions (Table 1 and supplemental Fig. S1B), supporting the assertion that the acetyl groups were likely located on the C3 and C4 carbons of the 6-deoxytalose, because according to published data these are the only positions available for modification, as the 6-deoxytalose is glycosidically linked to a rhamnose at the C2 carbon (28Eckstein T.M. Belisle J.T. Inamine J.M. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2797-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Overall, these data suggest that the biologically active serovar 2 GPL (i.e. native S2B) has one O-acetyl group on the 6-deoxytalose, and that when this substitution is selectively removed by mild alkali treatment, the GPL loses its activity. Moreover, the addition of a second O-acetyl group on the 6-deoxytalose also rendered the serovar 2 GPL non-active (i.e. native S2A). Together, these data indicate that a minimal structural variation, namely the acetylation pattern of the 6-deoxytalose, can dictate whether the serovar 2 GPL molecule signals through the TLR2. The Positioning of the O-Acetyl Group on the Biologically Active Serovar 2 GPL by NMR Spectroscopy—To establish the location and position of the O-acetyl groups on the serovar 2 GPL molecules, NMR spectroscopy was employed. The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of biologically active native S2B contained four dominant anomeric proton signals at 5.112, 4.981, 4.922, and 4.782 ppm, and tentative assignments were made to fucose (Fuc), 6-deoxytalose (dT), and two rhamnose (R) residues, respectively (Fig. 4A). Assignment of the H1dT signal was based on a partial analysis of the two-dimensional 1H-1H COSY spectrum (Fig. 4C), which revealed a relatively deshielded H4dT signal (∼5.09 ppm; Fig. 4A) consistent with the presence of acetylation at O4 of this residue. Observation of an H3-OH3 cross-peak is consistent with a lack of substitution at O3 in the 6-deoxytalose. The one-dimensional 1H spectrum showed the presence of four dominant CH3 signals arising from -OCH3 groups, and a single dominant CH3 signal a"

Here we investigate the role of SIRPalpha in regulating beta(2) integrin-mediated monocyte adhesion, transendothelial migration (TEM) and phagocytosis.THP-1 monocytes/macropahges treated with advanced glycation end products (AGEs) resulted in a decrease of SIRPalpha expression but an increase of beta(2) integrin cell surface expression and beta(2) integrin-mediated adhesion to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha)-stimulated human microvascular endothelial cell (HMEC-1) monolayers. In contrast, SIRPalpha overexpression in THP-1 cells showed a significant less monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1)-triggered cell surface expression of beta(2) integrins, in particular CD11b/CD18. SIRPalpha overexpression reduced beta(2) integrin-mediated firm adhesion of THP-1 cells to either TNFalpha-stimulated HMEC-1 monolayers or to immobilized intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). SIRPalpha overexpression also reduced MCP-1-initiated migration of THP-1 cells across TNFalpha-stimulated HMEC-1 monolayers. Furthermore, beta(2) integrin-mediated THP-1 cell spreading and actin polymerization in response to MCP-1, and phagocytosis of bacteria were both inhibited by SIRPalpha overexpression.SIRPalpha negatively regulates beta(2) integrin-mediated monocyte adhesion, transendothelial migration and phagocytosis, thus may serve as a critical molecule in preventing excessive activation and accumulation of monocytes in the arterial wall during early stage of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2047519810,"Background HIV-1 R5 viruses are characterized by a large phenotypic variation, that is reflected by the mode of coreceptor use. The ability of R5 HIV-1 to infect target cells expressing chimeric receptors between CCR5 and CXCR4 (R5broad viruses), was shown to correlate with disease stage in HIV-1 infected adults. Here, we ask the question whether phenotypic variation of R5 viruses could play a role also in mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1 and pediatric disease progression. Methodology/Principal Findings Viral isolates obtained from a total of 59 HIV-1 seropositive women (24 transmitting and 35 non transmitting) and 28 infected newborn children, were used to infect U87.CD4 cells expressing wild type or six different CCR5/CXCR4 chimeric receptors. HIV-1 isolates obtained from newborn infants had predominantly R5narrow phenotype (n = 20), but R5broad and R5X4 viruses were also found in seven and one case, respectively. The presence of R5broad and R5X4 phenotypes correlated significantly with a severe decline of the CD4+ T cells (CDC stage 3) or death within 2 years of age. Forty-three percent of the maternal R5 isolates displayed an R5broad phenotype, however, the presence of the R5broad virus was not predictive for MTCT of HIV-1. Of interest, while only 1 of 5 mothers with an R5X4 virus transmitted the dualtropic virus, 5 of 6 mothers carrying R5broad viruses transmitted viruses with a similar broad chimeric coreceptor usage. Thus, the maternal R5broad phenotype was largely preserved during transmission and could be predictive of the phenotype of the newborn's viral variant. Conclusions/Significance Our results show that R5broad viruses are not hampered in transmission. When transmitted, immunological failure occurs earlier than in children infected with HIV-1 of R5narrow phenotype. We believe that this finding is of utmost relevance for therapeutic interventions in pediatric HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W2107392093,"Brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which activates the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, increases formation of prions in scrapie-infected gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GT1-1) cells. This indicates that conversion of the cellular prion protein PrP(C) to its pathogenic isoform, PrP(Sc), can be regulated by physiological stimuli acting on specific signal transduction pathways. In the present study, we examined the involvement of different mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades and the cAMP-PKA pathway in formation of proteinase K-resistant PrP(Sc) (rPrP(Sc)). Long-term depolarization of GT1-1 cells infected with the Rocky Mountain Laboratory strain of scrapie increased the formation of rPrP(Sc). This effect was associated to ERK activation and was blocked by the MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126. Treatment with forskolin caused a similar increase in rPrP(Sc) formation that was prevented by the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89. Both depolarization and forskolin treatment were accompanied by increased phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal protein, while phosphorylation of histone H3 occurred only after forskolin treatment. Inhibitors of p38- and c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK) promoted the formation of rPrP(Sc), in contrast to the clearance of rPrP(Sc) produced by inhibitors of the ERK pathway. Thus, the ERK and the p38-JNK MAP kinase pathways appear to exert opposing effects on rPrP(Sc) formation, suggesting that balances between these intracellular signaling cascades may regulate replication of prions."

In general, the interactions are important for formation and remodeling of many types of extracellular HA matrixes. In the present study we have determined the molecular structure of the HC·TSG-6 cross-link. The results show that the β-carbon of Ser28 of TSG-6 (numbered according to the preprotein) forms an ester bond to the α-carbon of the C-terminal Asp residue of the HCs suggesting that Ser28 is part of a catalytic site. Site-directed mutagenesis similarly suggested that Ser28 was essential for the activity. The Asp-Ser28 bond is akin to the acyl-enzyme intermediate transiently formed during serine protease catalysis suggesting that TSG-6/HC2 similarly utilizes covalent catalysis.

Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using theoretical extinction coefficients (GPMAW software, Lighthouse Data). SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Samples were boiled in SDS-sample buffer containing dithiothreitol and resolved in 5–15% gradient gels using the glycine/2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propandiol-HCl system described previously (31Bury A.F. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 213: 491-500Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar).

Complex Formation between IαI and TSG-6 and Trypsinization—Human IαI and human recombinant TSG-6 (100 μg) expressed in insect cells were incubated in 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, at a 1:1 ratio (w/w) for 3 h at 37 °C. The complex was then denatured in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, pH 8, for 1 h at 25 °C and the disulfides reduced in the same buffer containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. Subsequently, the complex was carboxymethylated using 20 mm iodoacetamide and dialyzed into 10 mm NH4HCO3. The reduced and carboxymethylated sample was digested using 4 μg of trypsin for 20 h at 37 °C and lyophilized (SpeedVac, Savant). Purification of Cross-linked Peptides—The lyophilized peptides were rehydrated in 10 mm KH2PO4, 20% acetonitrile, pH 2.8 (Buffer A), filtered, and applied to a PolySULFOETHYL A column connected to a Ettan LC system (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer A. The bound material was eluted with buffer B (500 mm KCl in Buffer A) using a gradient from 0 to 15% B after 30 min, 50% B after 70 min, and 100% B after 95 min. The column was operated at 25 °C at a flow rate of 150 μl/min. Fractions of 300 μl were collected and the eluate monitored at 220 nm. The fractions of interest were either analyzed directly by RP-HPLC using a 2.1-mm Vydac C18 column equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid or pretreated with NaOH (final concentration 200 mm) for 15 min (3Enghild J.J.

Peptides derived from these samples or from diluted aliquots of the column fractions were purified on C18 stage tips and eluted directly onto MALDI targets using 1 μl of matrix solution containing 70% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.03% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v), and 0.4% recrystallized α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid. Aliquots from the reverse phase columns were concentrated to 5 μl (SpeedVac, Savant), diluted by adding 50 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, purified by C18 stage tips, and eluted directly onto MALDI targets. Chemically Assisted Fragmentation (CAF) Reagent Derivatization of Cross-linked Peptides—The derivatization of peptides was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (GE Healthcare). In short, tryptic peptides were purified on a C18 ZipTip and Lys side chains were converted to homoarginine to avoid sulfonation of Lys residues in the next step. Subsequently, the N-terminal of the peptides was sulfonated. Finally, the derivatized peptides were eluted from the ZipTip using the previously described matrix solution and spotted directly onto the MALDI target. MALDI-MS Analyses—MS or MS/MS spectra were collected using a Q-TOF Ultima Global mass spectrometer (Micromass/Waters Corp.) calibrated over the m/z 50–3000 range using a polyethylene glycol mixture. Each MS spectrum was calibrated using Glu-fibrinopeptide B (m/z 1570.6774) for external calibration. The obtained MS and MS/MS data were processed using Masslynx 4.0 software (Micromass). The GPMAW software package (Lighthouse Data) was used to generate theoretical MS/MS fragment ions of peptides, to facilitate manual interpretation of the obtained MS/MS data. N-terminal Sequence Analyses—Samples were applied directly to precycled Biobrene-coated micro-trifluoroacetic acid filter or adsorbed to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a ProSorb device (Applied Biosystems). Automated Edman degradation was performed in a PROCISE™ 494 HT sequencer with on-line phenylthiohydantion-derivative HPLC analysis using a 140C Microgradient System (Applied Biosystems), operated according to the manufacturer's recommendations. TSG-6 cDNA Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis of Ser28—Total RNA was isolated from 30 mg of human liver using the RNeasy mini kit from Qiagen. Subsequently, Superscript II reverse transcriptase was used to synthesize oligo(dT)-primed first strand cDNA from 3 μg of total RNA. Full-length TSG-6 cDNA was obtained from the cDNA library by PCR using Herculase Enhanced Polymerase and the following primer set spanning the open reading frame: 5′-AACTCCTAAAAAACCGCCACCATGATCATCTTAATTTACTTATTTCTCTT-3′ and 5′-TTATAAGTGGCTAAATCTTCCAGCTAAAAAG-3′ (start and stop (complementary) codons are bolded). The blunt end PCR product was initially cloned in the pCR-blunt II vector using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR Cloning Kit. Later the insert was excised with XhoI and KpnI and ligated into the pcDNA5/FRT mammalian expression vector. The TSG-6 insert sequence was confirmed by sequencing both strands. Afterward the S28A mutation was introduced in the TSG-6 cDNA by in vitro mutagenesis using Herculase Enhanced Polymerase and the following complementary mutation primer set: 5′-CAAGGATGGAATTTTTCATAACGCCATATGGCTTGAACGAGCA-3′ and 5′-TGCTCGTTCAAGCCATATGGCGTTATGAAAAATTCCATCCTTG-3′ (the mutation is underlined). The mutation was confirmed by sequencing both strands. HEK293 cells (a human embryonic kidney cell line) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with glutamine supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 100 IU penicillin/streptomycin. Approximately 5.0 × 106 cells were seeded onto 10-cm dishes 1 day prior to transfection. Four hours before transfection the medium was replaced with fresh medium. Transfection was done using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method with 20 μg of plasmid DNA per dish including a reporter plasmid containing the β-galactosidase gene for recording transfection efficiency. Three dishes with cells were transfected with mammalian expression vectors containing TSG-6 wild type cDNA, TSG-6 S28A mutant cDNA, or extracellular superoxide dismutase cDNA (control). Sixteen hours following transfection the medium was changed to the same as above but without calf serum. Finally conditioned serum-free medium was collected every 24 h over a period of 2 days and concentrated 50 times using Centriprep YM-10. The presence and the concentration of wild type TSG-6 and TSG-6 S28A mutant in the media were evaluated by immunoblotting. In addition, the expression of TSG-6, both wild type and mutant, was confirmed by direct analysis of the proteins by tandem mass spectrometry (see below). Complex Formation between IαI and TSG-6 S28A—Approximately 1 μg of purified human IαI was mixed with concentrated extracellular superoxide dismutase medium (control) or concentrated medium containing the same amount of either wild type or mutant TSG-6. MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 2 mm and the samples incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting was performed using an anti-TSG-6 antibody. Nanoelectrospray Mass Spectrometry—The concentrated medium derived from control, wild type TSG-6, and mutant TSG-6 expressions were subjected to reduced SDS-PAGE and stained for protein using Coomassie Blue. The proteins migrating in the area of interest were excised and digested with trypsin (16Sanggaard K.W. Karring H. Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11936-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 33Shevchenko A. Tomas H. Havlis J. Olsen J.V. Mann M. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2856-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (3393) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides were analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS using an EASY-nLC (Proxeon Biosystems) system connected in-line to a Q-TOF Ultima API (Micromass/Waters Corp.) mass spectrometer. The data were processed using Masslynx 4.0 (Micromass) and the generated peak list files were used to query the Swiss-Prot data base using the Mascot program (34Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6661) Google Scholar). The searches were performed with propionamide as fixed modification, peptide mass, and fragment mass tolerances offset to 0.2 Da, and no missed tryptic cleavage sites were allowed. HC·TSG-6 Cross-link Generation, Initial Purification, and Characterization—The cross-link was formed by incubating IαI and TSG-6, the reaction was followed by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels and immunoblotting using an anti-TSG-6 antibody (Fig. 1). The analyses confirmed that the covalent HC1·TSG-6 and HC2·TSG-6 complexes were formed. The cross-linked proteins were reduced and carboxymethylated, digested with trypsin, and subjected to strong cation exchange chromatography at pH 2.8 (supplemental data Fig. S1). Using these conditions each tryptic peptide was expected to contain two positive charges derived from the N-terminus and the C-terminal Lys or Arg residues. The only peptides containing more than two positive charges were either cross-linked and/or contain His residues. Consequently, the cross-linked HC·TSG-6 peptides were expected to elute later from the column than most peptides. In addition, the HC·TSG-6 cross-link readily dissociate during NaOH treatment (16Sanggaard K.W. Karring H. Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11936-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the mass of the cross-linked peptide is thus likely to be significantly reduced by NaOH treatment. These properties were exploited during the purification and detection of the cross-linked peptides. The mass of the late eluting peptides (fractions 22–44) were determined before and after NaOH treatment. A significant difference between the MALDI-MS analyses was observed in fractions 31 and 34–35 (supplemental data Fig. S2). Without NaOH treatment protonated molecular ions (MH+) peaks of m/z 2174.05 and 1943.92 were observed in fractions 31 (pool 1) and 34–35 (pool 2), respectively. In the samples treated with NaOH these molecular ions disappeared and a new MH+ at m/z 1486.73 became apparent (supplemental data Fig. S2). This molecular ion corresponded to the tryptic TSG-6 peptide, 22DGIFHNSIWLER33 (numbered according to preprotein), with a theoretical monoisotopic MH+ of 1486.74 Da. It has been shown that the cross-link between TSG-6 and HC2 is mediated by an ester between the C-terminal Asp residue of the HCs (16Sanggaard K.W. Karring H. Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11936-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and thus suggested that the unknown TSG-6 residue has to contain a hydroxyl group (Ser, Thr, or Tyr) (16Sanggaard K.W.

Day A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2007; 35: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recent studies have suggested that it also is the C-terminal Asp residue of HC1 that mediates the cross-link from HC1 to TSG-6 (16Sanggaard K.W. Karring H. Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Enghild J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11936-11942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17Rugg M.S. Willis A.C. Mukhopadhyay D. Hascall V.C. Fries E. Fulop C. Milner C.M. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25674-25686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The theoretical monoisotopic MH+ of the C-terminal tryptic peptides derived from HC1 and HC2 are 706.33 Da (632V2TGVDTD638) and 476.20 Da (645VEND648), respectively. Because water is lost during the formation of an ester linkage the theoretical monoisotopic protonated mass of the cross-linked peptides are 2174.04 Da (HC1·TSG-6), and 1943.91 Da (HC2·TSG-6). These values correspond to the observed MH+ values in untreated pool 1 (m/z 2174.05) and untreated pool 2 (m/z 1943.92), respectively. In addition both molecular ions disappeared after NaOH treatment (supplemental data Fig. S2). Taken together, these data suggests that 632VTGVDTD638 derived from HC1 and 645VEND648 derived from HC2 are cross-linked to the TSG-6 peptide 22DGIFHNS28IWLER33. The hydroxyl group of Ser28 appears to be the most likely candidate for the formation of the ester linkage as it is the only hydroxyl group containing residues in the peptide. All relevant fractions were analyzed and only the mentioned fractions contained NaOH-sensitive cross-links suggesting that Ser28 exclusively mediates the HC·TSG-6 cross-link. RP-HPLC Purification of the HC1·TSG-6 and HC2·TSG-6 Cross-links—The HC·TSG-6 cross-links were further purified by RP-HPLC. Pool 1 containing HC1·TSG-6 and pool 2 containing the HC2·TSG-6 cross-link were subjected to RP-HPLC before and after NaOH treatment (Figs. 2, A and B, and 3, A and B). A visual comparison of the chromatograms revealed peptides sensitive to NaOH treatment (Figs. 2A, peak α, and 3A, peak γ). MS analysis confirmed that they contained the purified HC1·TSG-6 (Fig. 2C, m/z 2174.04) and purified HC2·TSG-6 cross-link (Fig. 3C, m/z 1943.92). Comparison of the absorbance at 220 nm of the two purified cross-links (Figs. 2A, peak α, and 3A, peak γ) indicates that the amounts of the purified complexes are similar. This was anticipated, because the amount of HC1·TSG-6 and HC2·TSG-6 generated during IαI/TSG-6 interaction is similar (Fig. 1).FIGURE 3Purification of HC2·TSG-6 complex. Pool 2, containing the HC2·TSG-6 complex, from the strong cation exchange-HPLC analysis was subjected to RP-HPLC analysis directly (A) or after treatment with NaOH (B). The asterisk-labeled peak contains a non-peptide derived contamination. C, MALDI-TOF MS analysis of peak γ from RP-HPLC analysis of the untreated pool 2 (panel A) shows that the peak contains the HC2·TSG-6 complex (theoretical monoisotopic MH+: m/z 1943.91). D, MALDI-TOF MS analysis of peak λ from RP-HPLC of the NaOH treated pool 2 (panel B) shows that the peak contains the tryptic TSG-6 peptide (22DGIFHNSIWLER33, theoretical monoisotopic MH+: m/z 1486.73), which participates in the cross-link. The analyses demonstrate that HC2·TSG-6 (645VEND648 cross-linked to 22DGIFHNSIWLER33) has been purified and is present in peak γ.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The chromatograms contained other peaks, the two dominating peptides in the separation of the untreated HC1·TSG-6 cross-link included peptides of m/z 1424.59 and 2241.15 (Fig. 2A, labeled with *). These were anticipated as they were present in the direct MS analysis of pool 1 (supplemental data Fig. S2A), but they were not affected by NaOH treatment (Fig. 2B). An analysis of all peaks generated after NaOH treatment of the HC1·TSG-6 cross-link revealed that the TSG-6 peptide 22DGIFHNS28IWLER33 co-elutes with one of the two major peaks in the chroma"

Accordingly, the molecular mechanisms that account for these changes are heavily studied. Postsynaptically, changes in synaptic strength can occur by altering the amount of neurotransmitter receptors at the synapse or by altering the functional properties of synaptic receptors. In this study, we examined the biochemical changes produced following chemically induced long term depression in acute hippocampal CA1 minislices. Using three independent methods, we found that this treatment did not lead to an internalization of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. Furthermore, when the plasma membrane was separated into synaptic membrane-enriched and extrasynaptic membrane-enriched fractions, we actually observed a significant increase in the concentration of AMPA receptors at the synapse. However, phosphorylation of Ser-845 on the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 was significantly decreased throughout the neuron, including in the synaptic membrane-enriched fraction. In addition, phosphorylation of Ser-831 on GluR1 was decreased specifically in the synaptic membrane-enriched fraction. Phosphorylation of these residues has been demonstrated to control AMPA receptor function. From these data, we conclude that the decrease in synaptic strength is likely the result of a change in the functional properties of AMPA receptors at the synapse and not a decrease in the amount of synaptic receptors.

Rapid excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus is mediated predominantly by glutamate-activated AMPA 2The abbreviations used are: AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproponic acid; AMPAR, AMPA receptor; LFS, low frequency stimulation; LTD, long term depression; cLTD, chemically induced LTD; PSD, postsynaptic density; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; PP1, protein phosphatase 1; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; PP2B, protein phosphatase 2B; fEPSP, field excitatory postsynaptic potential; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate; αCaMKII, the α subunit of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; ACSF, artificial cerebrospinal fluid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; AIR, arbitrary immunoreactive; X-linked, cross-linked; un-X-linked, uncross-linked; P, postnatal. 2The abbreviations used are: AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproponic acid; AMPAR, AMPA receptor; LFS, low frequency stimulation; LTD, long term depression; cLTD, chemically induced LTD; PSD, postsynaptic density; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartate; PP1, protein phosphatase 1; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; PP2B, protein phosphatase 2B; fEPSP, field excitatory postsynaptic potential; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate; αCaMKII, the α subunit of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; ACSF, artificial cerebrospinal fluid; BSA, bovine serum albumin; AIR, arbitrary immunoreactive; X-linked, cross-linked; un-X-linked, uncross-linked; P, postnatal. receptors (AMPARs). Theoretically, long term changes in the strength of synaptic transmission, as occur during long term potentiation and long term depression (LTD), can arise from changes in the amount of glutamate that is released from the presynaptic terminal, changes in the number of synaptic AMPARs, or changes in the functional properties of synaptic AMPARs. Experimentally, LTD of synaptic responses has been shown to be induced by several different treatments, the most common of which include several low frequency stimulation (LFS) paradigms (1Dudek S.M. Bear M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4363-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar), N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) application (2Lee H.K. Kameyama K. Huganir R.L. Bear M.F.

Neuron. 2000; 25: 649-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). The biochemical mechanisms that underlie these different types of synaptic depression have been the subject of numerous studies in many different experimental systems.A number of studies have demonstrated that protein phosphatase activity is a requirement for long term depression. This was originally demonstrated through the use of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), 2A (PP2A), and 2B (PP2B/calcineurin) inhibitors, which were shown to inhibit both the induction and the maintenance of LTD (6Mulkey R.M. Herron C.E. Malenka R.C. Science. 1993; 261: 1051-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 7Mulkey R.M. Endo S. Shenolikar S. Malenka R.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that synaptically localized PP1 is critical for the induction of LTD and that enhancing the synaptic targeting of PP1 facilitates long term depression (8Hu X.D. Huang Q. Yang X. Xia H. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 4674-4686Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of protein kinase A inhibits the induction of LFS and NMDA-induced LTD, and protein kinase A inhibition has been shown to result in a rundown of synaptic responses that occludes subsequent LTD (9Kameyama K. Lee H.K. Bear M.F. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1163-1175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The translocation of protein kinase A away from synaptic substrates may be an important step in LTD because NMDA-induced depression has been correlated with a redistribution of the kinase away from the synapse (10Snyder E.M.

Dell'Acqua M.L. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2391-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and disrupting the binding of protein kinase A to one of its anchoring proteins causes synaptic response rundown (12Tavalin S.J. Colledge M. Hell J.W. Langeberg L.K. Huganir R.L. Scott J.D. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3044-3051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that occludes induced synaptic depression (10Snyder E.M. Colledge M.

Importantly, one of the substrates being dephosphorylated during synaptic depression appears to be the AMPAR. Several groups using different LTD induction protocols and experimental systems have reported decreases in the phosphorylation of GluR1 Ser-845, which is a protein kinase A substrate (2Lee H.K. Kameyama K. Huganir R.L. Bear M.F. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1151-1162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar, 8Hu X.D. Huang Q. Yang X. Xia H. J.

Furthermore, mice in which Ser-845 has been mutated to alanine have deficits in long term depression (15Lee H.K. Takamiya K. Han J.S. Man H. Kim C.H. Rumbaugh G. Yu S. Ding L. He C. Petralia R.S. Wenthold R.J. Gallagher M. Huganir R.L. Cell. 2003; 112: 631-643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which Ser-845 dephosphorylation may contribute to LTD are unknown, but two principal hypotheses have been presented and are discussed below.Phosphorylation of Ser-845 is known to influence AMPAR functional properties (16Roche K.W. O'Brien R.J. Mammen A.L. Bernhardt J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1179-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Specifically, phosphorylation of this residue has been demonstrated to control peak open probability of GluR1-containing receptors (17Banke T.G. Bowie D. Lee H. Huganir R.L. Schousboe A. Traynelis S.F. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 89-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of this, several researchers have postulated that a decrease in AMPAR function as the result of Ser-845 dephosphorylation may play a major role in the depression of synaptic responses (18Song I. Huganir R.L. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 578-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). However, a key issue for this model is whether the stoichiometry of Ser-845 phosphorylation is decreased on synaptic receptors following LTD induction.Another postsynaptic mechanism suggested by many to be involved in synaptic depression is the internalization of AMPARs. A role for endocytic processes in general for LTD is provided by studies that have shown that inhibitors of clathrin mediated endocytosis prevent LTD induction (5Man H.Y. Lin J.W. Ju W.H. Ahmadian G.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2391-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for this phosphorylation site in AMPAR trafficking. However, to date, there is no known mechanism by which Ser-845 might influence trafficking as this site is not part of any known endocytic motifs. In the present report, we have attempted to explore these two hypotheses by directly examining AMPAR phosphorylation and localization following chemical induction of LTD.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCA1 Minislice Preparation and Treatment—All of the experiments used in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. Twenty-one-(P21) to twenty-nine-(P29) day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were used for all experiments. After sacrifice, the brain was immediately removed and placed in ice-cold oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF: 124 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm dextrose, 1 mm KH2PO4, 25.7 mm NaHCO3). Both hippocampi were carefully dissected out and unrolled along the hippocampal fissure. Subsequently, area CA1 was isolated by two cuts and then sliced into 400-μm minislices using a McIlwain tissue chopper. On average, 27 minislices could be harvested from each animal. For all of the electrophysiology experiments and some of the biochemistry experiments, the minislices were transferred to chambers perfused with 32 °C ACSF that was bubbled with a 95% O2, 5%CO2 mix. The perfusion rate in these chambers was 3 ml/min. For the remainder of the biochemistry experiments, the minislices were transferred to static chambers and incubated at interface in 32 °C ACSF (which had been bubbled with a 95% O2, 5%CO2 mix) and humidified with 95% O2, 5%CO2. For both setups, minislices were recovered in ACSF for at least 90 min before treatment or recording, with ACSF being changed every 15 min in the static chambers. To induce cLTD in the perfused chambers, NMDA was perfused over the slices at a final concentration of 20 μm for 3 min. To induce cLTD in the interface chambers, the ACSF was replaced with ACSF containing 20 μm NMDA for 3 min. After 3 min, the NMDA ACSF was replaced with regular ACSF. The control treatment for these experiments was ACSF containing vehicle (H20).Electrophysiology—Each n for the electrophysiology experiments represents data obtained from one minislice. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were evoked by stimulating the Schafer collateral-commissural pathway using a bipolar tungsten electrode. A silver chloride recording electrode inside a finely drawn glass capillary containing ACSF was placed in the dendritic layer of the minislice. Both the amplitude and the initial slope of the fEPSP were recorded at the frequency of 0.033 Hz. The stimulus intensity was adjusted to produce a fEPSP with 50–70% of the maximum achievable response. Following the recording of a stable baseline (at least 20 min), cLTD was induced (as described above). The stimulator was turned off during the treatment and the washout of the NMDA to ensure that depression was not dependent on electrical stimulation. Depression (percent change) at 45 min following the termination of the cLTD treatment was calculated by comparing the average of the responses recorded from 40–50 min following the termination of the treatment to the average of the responses recorded 10 min immediately prior to the treatment.Subcellular Fractionation—For experiments in which the lysed crude synaptosomal membrane fraction (LP1) was collected, each n represents all of the minislices that could be harvested from one animal divided equally between control and cLTD conditions. For experiments in which the postsynaptic density (PSD)/synaptic membrane-enriched fraction (TxP) was collected, each n represents all of the minislices that could be harvested from two animals divided equally between control and cLTD conditions (the pooling of animals was required to ensure that each fraction contained a sufficient amount of protein for analysis). In both cases, minislices were harvested 45 min after the treatment into ice-cold homogenization buffer containing 320 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 100 μm Na3VO4, 40 mm NaF, 300 nm okadaic acid, and 1 mm EDTA. Following harvesting, the slices were immediately homogenized in a glass grinding vessel by a Teflon pestle rotating at 1000 rpm. Subsequently, a subcellular fractionation protocol was employed (11Smith K.E. Gibson E.S. Dell'Acqua M.L. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2391-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 33Carlin R.K.

The homogenate was spun at 1000 × g for 10 min, and the pellet (P1), which contains nuclei and incompletely homogenized material, was discarded. The supernatant (S1) was then spun at 10,000 × g for 15 min. For the LP1 experiments, the pellet from this spin (P2) was resuspended in homogenization buffer lacking sucrose and hypoosmotically lysed for 30 min on ice. The lysed P2 was then respun at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting pellet, LP1 (lysed crude synaptosomal membrane fraction), was resuspended in homogenization buffer. For TxP experiments, the P2 was resuspended in homogenization buffer (lacking sucrose) containing 0.5% Triton X-100, homogenized with a rotating plastic pestle, incubated on ice for 40 min, and then spun at 32,000 × g for 20 min. The pellet from this spin, TxP, was resuspended in homogenization buffer. The supernatant from this spin was subjected to acetone precipitation to concentrate the protein. Eight volumes of acetone were added to the supernatant, which was then incubated at –20 °C overnight. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 15 min. The pellet from this spin, extrasynaptic membrane-enriched fraction (TxS), was dried and then resuspended in homogenization buffer. The supernatant from the second spin (S2) was spun at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet from this spin, microsome/light membrane-enriched fraction (P3), was resuspended in homogenization buffer. All of the above spins were conducted at 4 °C to inhibit enzyme action. The final pellets were sonicated and boiled in 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris (pH 8) for 5 min and kept at –80 °C. We have previously characterized these fractionation procedures (36Davies K.D. Alvestad R.M. Coultrap S.J. Browning M.D. Brain Res. 2007; 1158: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 37Goebel S.M. Alvestad R.M. Coultrap S.J. Browning M.D. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2005; 142: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Cross-linking—For cross-linking experiments, each n represents all of the minislices that could be harvested from one animal divided equally between control un-X-linked (un-cross-linked), control X-linked (cross-linked), cLTD un-X-linked, and cLTD X-linked conditions. Minislices were harvested 45 min after the treatment into ice-cold ACSF (for un-X-linked) or ACSF containing 1 mg/ml bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3) (for X-linked). Minislices were then incubated on ice while rocking for 40 min. Following 40 min, the cross-linking reaction was quenched by three washes with ice-cold ACSF containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6). The minislices were then sonicated and boiled in 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris (pH 8) for 5 min and kept at –80 °C. To determine changes in the amount of internal receptor, cross-linked samples were directly compared. To determine changes in the percentage of surface expression, the following equation was used: ((un-X-linked – X-linked)/un-X-linked) × 100%.Semiquantitative Western Blotting—Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA™ protein assay kit from Pierce with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Samples were prepared for gel loading such that they contained a known amount of total protein and 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, bromphenol blue, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol). A five-point standard curve of known total protein concentration was prepared as above from SDS-homogenized recovered whole hippocampal slices. The samples, along with the standard curve, were run through 7.5% polyacrylamide gels at 150–200 V for 45–60 min. Separated proteins were transferred to PolyScreen polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots were then blocked in 5% milk or 3% BSA in Tris-buffered saline with Tween (TBST: 140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody in 1% milk or 1% BSA. Following three 10-min washes in TBST, blots were incubated in secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase in 1% milk or 1% BSA at room temperature for 1 h. After three 10-min washes in TBST, bands were detected using Pierce SuperSignal® chemiluminescence kits and the Alpha Innotech ChemiImager 4400 imaging system. In some cases, blots were stripped with Restore™ Western blot stripping buffer from Pierce for 60 min at 60 °C, and then subjected to six 10-min washes in TBST followed by blocking and antibody incubation. Primary antibodies were as follows: GluR1 and GluR2/3 (Chemicon) used at 1:3000 in BSA, phospho-Ser-845 and phospho-Ser-831 (PhosphoSolutions) used at 1:1000 in BSA, PP2Aα (BD Pharmingen) used at 1:5000 in milk, synapsin, NR2B, and NR1 (PhosphoSolutions) used at 1:2000 in BSA, the α subunit of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (αCaMKII) (BD Pharmingen) used at 1:3000 in BSA, phospho-Thr-286 (PhosphoSolutions) used at 1:3000 in milk, PSD-95 (Affinity Bioreagents) used at 1:5000 in BSA, and transferrin receptor (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) used at 1:1000 in milk.Western Blot Analysis—Quantitation of Western blots was performed using AlphaEase software. An integrated density value for samples and standards was determined as the sum of the intensity of the pixels constituting each band. A line was generated from the standard curve by plotting the integrated density value versus the total amount of protein loaded for each curve point. Using this line, the integrated density value of each sample was used to calculate its immunoreactivity, which was measured in arbitrary immunoreactive (AIR) units. This number was then divided by the amount of total protein loaded in micrograms for the sample to obtain the AIR units/μg. The AIR units/μg is a measure of relative concentration that can be compared between samples. Relative phospho-stoichiometry was calculated by dividing the AIR units/μg determined with the phospho-specific antibody by the AIR units/μg determined with the pan antibody. To calculate total AIR units in the fractions, the AIR units/μg value was multiplied by the total protein concentration of the fraction and by the total volume of the fraction. The percentage of total GluR1 and GluR2/3 in the fractions (reported in Fig. 5, B and D) was calculated by dividing the total AIR units value for a particular fraction by the summation of the total AIR units for the three fractions (making this summation 100%). Only samples with an integrated density value within the standard curve were used for analysis.RESULTSLong term depression was first described following an LFS paradigm (1Dudek S.M. Bear M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4363-4367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar), and LFS remains the most common method to induce LTD in hippocampal slices. However, stimulation by a single electrode only affects a limited region of the slice (38Dunwiddie T. Lynch G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1978; 276: 353-367Crossref Scopus (361) Google Scholar), and therefore, it is problematic to measure biochemical changes in the entire slice following LFS-induced depression. Because of this, many researchers have turned to inducing LTD by chemical means, which, in theory, should activate virtually all of the synapses in the slice. It has been well established that brief application of NMDA results in synaptic depression in hippocampal slices (2Lee H.K. Kameyama K. Huganir R.L. Bear M.F.

Here we confirm that a 3-min, 20 μm NMDA treatment (cLTD) induces a stable, long-lasting depression of the fEPSP recorded in the dendritic layer of CA1 minislices from P21–P29 rats (Fig. 1). As has been described previously, the synaptic response initially completely disappeared and then returned to a depressed level. Both the amplitude (Fig. 1B) and the initial slope (Fig. 1C) of the fEPSP were significantly depressed 45 min following the termination of the treatment (78.7 and 78.8% of baseline, respectively). All of the following biochemical experiments were performed at this time point, because here the synaptic response had stabilized.FIGURE 1Long-lasting depression of fEPSPs is induced in CA1 minislices by a 3-min, 20 μm NMDA treatment. A, sample traces of synaptically evoked fEPSPs before (average of 20 fEPSPs recorded in the 10 min prior to start of treatment) (baseline) and after (average of 20 fEPSPs recorded from 40 to 50 min following termination of treatment) (cLTD) NMDA treatment for one experiment.

https://openalex.org/W1964011830,"Overriding the G2 DNA damage checkpoint permits precocious entry into mitosis that ultimately leads to mitotic catastrophe. Mitotic catastrophe is manifested by an unscheduled activation of CDK1, caspase activation and apoptotic cell death. We found that although cyclin B1 was required for mitotic catastrophe, it was cleaved into a ∼35 kDa protein by a caspase-dependent mechanism during the process. Cyclin B1 cleavage occurred after Asp123 in the motif ILVD123↓, and mutation of this motif attenuated the cleavage. Cleavage was abolished by a pan-caspase inhibitor as well as by specific inhibitors for the effector caspase-6 and the initiator caspase-8. Cleavage created a truncated cyclin B1 lacking part of the NH2-terminal regulatory domain that included the destruction box sequence. Although cleavage of cyclin B1 itself was not absolutely required for mitotic catastrophe, expression of the truncated product enhanced cell death. In support of this, ectopic expression of this truncated cyclin B1 was not only sufficient to induce mitotic block and apoptosis but also enhanced mitotic catastrophe induced by ionizing radiation and caffeine. These data underscore a possible linkage between mitotic and apoptotic functions by caspase-dependent processing of mitotic activators."
https://openalex.org/W2062091499,"Sphingomyelinases (SMases) hydrolyze membrane sphingomyelin to ceramide and are expressed by diverse host and microbial cell types populating mucosal surfaces. Exogenous bacterial SMase acts on the basolateral membrane of polarized human intestinal epithelial cells to repress the cAMP-induced Cl(-) secretory response, but how this occurs is unknown. We show here that SMase acts by down-regulating a cAMP-gated basolateral membrane K(+) conductance. Neither phosphocholine, ceramide-1-phosphate, nor sphingosine-1-phosphate recapitulates this effect, indicating that ceramide production is the decisive factor. Basolaterally applied SMase induced the phosphorylation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK), and inhibition of JNK rescued the effect of SMase on cAMP-dependant secretion. SMase secreted by normal human fibroblasts specifically recapitulated the effect on cAMP-induced Cl(-) secretion, indicating that cell types inhabiting the subepithelial space can provide such an activity to the basolateral membrane of intestinal enterocytes in trans. Thus, conversion of sphingomyelin to ceramide in basolateral membranes of intestinal cells rapidly activates JNK to inhibit a cAMP-gated K(+) conductance and thereby attenuates Cl(-) secretion. These results define a novel lipid-mediated pathway for regulation of salt and water homeostasis at mucosal surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W2081960990,"The ATP synthase is under a number of mechanisms of regulation. The chloroplast ATPase has a unique mode of regulation in which activity is controlled by the redox state in the organelle. This mode of regulation is determined by a small unique region within the γ-subunit and this region contains two cysteine residues. Introduction of this region within the yeast γ-subunit causes a defect in oxidative phosphorylation. Oxidative phosphorylation is restored if the cysteine residues are replaced with serine. Biochemical analysis of the chimeric mitochondrial ATPase indicates that the ATP synthase is not largely altered with the cysteine residues in either the oxidized or reduced states. However, the level and activity of cytochrome c oxidase are decreased by about 90%, whereas that of NADH dehydrogenase and cytochrome c reductase are unchanged as compared with the wild-type enzymes. The level and activity of cytochrome c oxidase are restored with replacement of the cysteine residues with serine in the regulatory region. These results indicate that the chimeric ATP synthase containing cysteine, but not serine, decreases the expression or assembly of cytochrome c oxidase with little effect on the activity of the ATP synthase.

The mitochondrial ATP synthase (560,000 Da) is composed of the F1-ATPase, which contains the catalytic sites and F0, the proton pore. The F1-ATPase is comprised of α3β3γδϵ (360,000 Da) with the three catalytic sites formed by the αβ pairs (1Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2751) Google Scholar). The γδϵ-subunits form the central stalk and are located within the core formed by the three pairs of αβ-subunits (2Gibbons C. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1055-1061Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 3Kabaleeswaran V. Puri N. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5433-5442Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). F0 is minimally composed of abc10 and acts as a proton turbine whose rotation is coupled to the central stalk. A peripheral stalk formed by subunits b, d, h, and subunit 5, links the a-subunit to the periphery of the α/β core and acts as a stator, preventing the core from following rotation of the central stalk (4Walker J.E.

Commun. 2006; 62: 530-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The ATP synthase is subject to regulation by a number of different means. In eukaryotes, the mitochondrial inhibitor protein inhibits hydrolysis of ATP to presumably prevent the wasteful loss of ATP under conditions where ATP is not being made (7Pullman M.E. Monroy G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3762-3769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitor protein is not present in bacteria, but analogous regulation is thought to be effected by the C-terminal of the ϵ-subunit (8Kuki M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Amemura A. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Xiong H. Zhang D. Vik S.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16423-16429Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 10Kato-Yamada Y.

(The bacterial ϵ-subunit is homologous to the mitochondrial δ-subunit.) The γ-subunit of the chloroplast ATPase contains a unique disulfide bond that inhibits ATP hydrolysis by CF1, but in the reduced form, is non-inhibitory (11Nalin C.M. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7275-7280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This regulatory region thus acts as a redox sensor to inhibit the chloroplast enzyme under conditions where ATP is not being made and may act in concert with the inhibitory action of the C-terminal domain of the ϵ-subunit (12Samra H.S. Gao F. He F. Hoang E. Chen Z. Gegenheimer P.A. Berrie C.L. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31041-31049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Two cysteine residues, Cys199 and Cys205, in the chloroplast γ-subunit are responsible for the redox regulation of the chloroplast ATP synthase (11Nalin C.M. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7275-7280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The region containing Cys199 and Cys205 is unique to the chloroplast γ-subunit. However, introduction of this region into the bacterial enzyme has been shown to convey the redox regulation to the bacterial enzyme (13Bald D. Noji H. Stumpp M.T. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12757-12762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). There are five enzyme complexes that participate in oxidative phosphorylation: complexes I, II, III, IV, and V corresponding to NADH dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome c oxidase, and the ATP synthase, respectively. In yeast, supercomplexes have been identified that are composed of Complexes III and IV (14Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 15Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37861-37867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, almost all of Complex I is in a supercomplex with Complexes III and IV. Furthermore, the ATP synthase has been reported to be in a supercomplex with the phosphate carrier and ATP/ADP translocase (14Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar, 15Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. J. Biol.

These supercomplexes are thought to add an additional level of efficiency to the reaction pathway. In addition, in yeast and mammalian cells, the ATP synthase forms a dimer (14Schagger H. Pfeiffer K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1777-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar), and in yeast, it is at least partly responsible for formation of cristae (19Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brethes D. di Rago J.P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The ATP synthase dimer is mediated by subunit g of the ATP synthase. Deletion of subunit g eliminates the dimer form of the ATP synthase and also eliminates the cristae in the yeast mitochondrion suggesting a role of the ATP synthase in the formation of cristae (19Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brethes D. di Rago J.P. Velours J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Deletion of subunit g also has an effect on the activity of cytochrome c oxidase suggesting the importance of the dimer form of the ATP synthase in expression or stability of cytochrome c oxidase (20Boyle G.M. Roucou X. Nagley P. Devenish R.J. Prescott M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have investigated the structure function relationship of the redox regulatory region of the chloroplast ATP synthase by making chimeric constructs of the yeast and chloroplast γ-subunit. By use of homologous recombination in yeast, five chimeric constructs have been made to test the capacity of regions within the chloroplast γ-subunit to confer redox regulation to the yeast ATPase. The chimeric construct containing the entire putative regulatory region of the chloroplast γ-subunit, when inserted in the yeast γ-subunit, inactivated oxidative phosphorylation in the yeast, as judged by biochemical assays and the ability of the yeast to grow on a non-fermentable carbon source. However, the defect was due to the nearly complete loss of cytochrome c oxidase activity, with only mild alterations in the ATP synthase or in the other complexes of the electron transport chain. The results of this study provide new structure/function information on the chloroplast regulatory region and suggest that the ATP synthase is either directly or indirectly related to the function of cytochrome c oxidase. Yeast Strains and Media—Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strain W303-1B (MAT α, ade2, his3, leu2-3, trp1, ura3) (A gift from Dr. Alex Tzagoloff, Columbia University, NY) is the parent strain of those generated in this study. Supplemental Table S1 shows a list of the yeast strains used in this study. Yeast was grown at 30 °C in YPAD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, 30 mg/liter adenine), YPGal (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% galactose), YPG (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 3% glycerol), or synthetic media (0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose supplemented with amino acids at 20 mg/liter). Yeast transformation was performed by the LiAc method as described (21Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2893) Google Scholar). Construction of Yeast/Chloroplast Chimeric γ-Subunits—Yeast/chloroplast chimeric γ-subunit were made using gap repair (22Bakhtiari N. Jie L.Z. Yao B.Y. Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16363-16369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The region of the gene coding for the regulatory region of the chloroplast γ subunit was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The 5′ ends of the PCR primers contained 30 bases that corresponded to the target point for homologous recombination. The PCR products were co-transformed with a linear plasmid DNA (pYATP3NcoI) containing yeast ATP3 into W303-1A (23Lai-Zhang J. Mueller D.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2409-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The plasmid DNA was made linear by making a single restriction cut within ATP3. Upon transformation into yeast, homologous recombination occurs between the PCR product and the corresponding linear plasmid. This recombination event replaced the corresponding domain in ATP3 with the regulatory region from chloroplast enzyme and circularized the plasmid DNA. The recombinants were selected by growth of cells on minimum media devoid of tryptophan. The plasmids were extracted from the transformants and transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue by electroporation as detailed in the instrument manual (Bio-Rad). The plasmid DNA was purified from E. coli and sequenced (University of Chicago Cancer Research DNA Sequencing Facility). Supplemental Table S2 shows a list of plasmids used in this study. Expression and Purification of Chimeric F1-ATPase and F1F0-ATPase—The plasmids encoding wild-type and different chimeric γ subunits (pYATP3, pYCATP3(II), pYCATP3(I+II), pYCATP3(II+III), pYCATP3(I+II+III), and pYCATP3(I+II+III, C2S) (supplemental Table S2) were co-transformed with pYATP2 into HSY201 to generate strains expressing chimeric ATP synthase. F1-ATPase was purified using nickel-affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography as described (24Mueller D.M. Puri N. Kabaleeswaran V. Terry C. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 37: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The enzyme was stored at 4 °C as a precipitate in 70% saturated ammonium sulfate. F1F0-ATP synthase was purified using nickel-affinity chromatography and size exclusion chromatography. Mitochondria were purified and converted to submitochondrial particles by washing with SB buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 0.05 m phosphate, 5 mm ϵ-amino caproic acid, 5 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). The submitochondrial particle (8.5 mg/ml) were extracted with 1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside and the solution was centrifuged at 158,000 × g at 4 °C. The extract was loaded at 2 ml/min onto a nickel-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with Buffer A10 (10% glycerol, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.05 m phosphate, 5 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 mm imidazole, and 0.01% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, pH 7.5). The column was washed with 20 ml of Buffer A10 and eluted with Buffer B10 (same buffer composition as A10 with 300 mm imidazole). The peak fractions were collected and precipitated with 8% polyethylene glycol 6000 and stored at 4 °C. The precipitated protein was resuspended with S300 buffer (20 mm Tris, 50 mm sucrose, 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm ATP, pH 8.0) and loaded onto a Superpose-12 column (GE Healthcare) at 0.5 ml/min. The ATP synthase eluted at 20 min. Peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar) and the fractions containing non-proteolyzed F1F0-ATPase were pooled and stored at 4 °C. The concentration of the soluble F1-ATPase was determined by the Bradford (26Stoscheck C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 50-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar) method. The concentration of F1F0-ATP synthase was determined by densitometry of the Coomassie Blue staining intensity of the α- and β-subunits after separation by SDS-gel electrophoresis using purified F1-ATPase as a standard. Biochemical Studies—Mitochondria were isolated from yeast strains as described (27Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5634-5639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of mitochondrial protein was determined using the BCA protein assay (26Stoscheck C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 50-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis (28Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44915) Google Scholar) was performed using rabbit antibodies directed against yeast Cox2p, Cox3p, cytochrome b, Rieske FeS protein (Gifts from Dr. Rosemary Stuart, Marquette University, Milwaukee, WI), and chicken antibodies against α- and β-subunits of yeast F1. Mitochondrial respiratory enzyme activities (NADH dehydrogenase, cytochrome c reductase, and cytochrome c oxidase) were measured as described (29Paul M.F. Velours J. Arselin de Chateaubodeau G. Aigle M. Guerin B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Tzagoloff A. Akai A. Needleman R.B. J. Biol.

ATPase activity was determined by the coupled enzyme reaction (27Mueller D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5634-5639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at 30 °C. As indicated, the samples were incubated with 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) 3The abbreviation used is: DTT, dithiothreitol. or 100 μm CuCl2 for 30 min before the assay. ATPase activity of F1F0-ATP synthase was measured after reconstituting the enzyme into liposomes as described (32Knowles A.F. Penefsky H.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1329: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) with some modifications. α-Phosphatidylcholine (60 mg) was suspended in 2 ml of REV buffer (50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20 mm TrisSO4, pH 8.0). The lipid dispersion was placed in a 10-ml glass tube and sonicated for 3 min at 10 °C (model G112SP1G, Laboratory Supplies Co., Hicksville, NY). Reconstitution of the ATP synthase in liposomes was performed by mixing 0.3 ml of the liposomes (30 mg/ml), 0.15 ml of REV buffer, and F1F0 (90 μg) to a final volume of 0.54 ml. Triton X-100 (60 μl of a 10% solution) was added to the mixture with vigorous mixing. The mixture was stirred slowly for 10 min. after which Bio-Beads (200 mg) were added and the mixture was stirred for 3 h. The slightly turbid proteoliposomes were carefully removed avoiding the Bio-Beads. The proteoliposomes were stored at 4 °C. Enzyme Kinetics—For determination of Km, the ATPase activities were measured in the presence of MgATP ranging from 2 μm to 0.8 mm. Kinetics parameters were determined according to simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics using Enzyme Kinetics Module from Sigmaplot 9.0 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA). Cytochrome Spectrum Analysis—Submitochondrial particles (submitochondrial particles (2.5 ml at 20 mg/ml) in 0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5) were dissolved with addition of KCl (500 mg), 1 m Tris, pH 7.5 (0.5 ml), and 10% potassium deoxycholate (1 ml), while mixing. The volume was adjusted to 10 ml with distilled water. The solubilized submitochondrial particles were centrifuged at 125,000 × g for 15 min and potassium cholate was added to the supernatant to 1%. The hemes were oxidized with potassium ferrycyanide (0.015%) or reduced with sodium dithionite. Absorbance difference spectra were recorded at room temperature using a HP8453 diode array spectrophotometer. Association of Cytochrome c Oxidase and the ATP Synthase—The association between the yeast ATP synthase and cytochrome c oxidase was studied by co-purification of cytochrome c oxidase with ATP synthase. ATP synthase was purified from mitochondria isolated from a strain (HSY202) in which the β-subunit had a His6 tag on the NH2 terminus. Mitochondria (10 mg/ml) were adjusted to 1.5% digitonin, the solution was centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was applied to a nickel-Sepharose column (5 ml, GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer composed of 10% glycerol, 0.3 m NaCl, 50 mm phosphate, 5 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 5 mm benzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 30 mm imidazole, and 0.01% digitonin, pH 7.5. The protein was eluted with the wash buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. Fractions containing the eluted portion were pooled and analyzed using Western blot with antibodies indicated. The primary structure comparison between yeast and chloroplast γ-subunit is shown in Fig. 1A. Overall the subunits share 34% identical amino acids and 46% homology. This is similar to the percent identity and homology between γ-subunits from yeast and bovine (42 and 54%, respectively). The central region, residues 174-232 in the chloroplast γ-subunit, contains regions that are distinct from those in the yeast γ-subunit and within that region reside the cysteine residues required for redox regulation, Cys199 and Cys205. This is the only region identified by analysis of the primary sequence that obviously differed between the yeast and chloroplast γ-subunit, suggesting that no other regions are required for redox regulation. The putative redox regulatory region was divided into three regions, I, II, and III, colored in Fig. 1A as blue, green, and red, respectively. These regions are highlighted in the model of the structure of the yeast F1-ATPase with the corresponding colors for regions I and III (blue and red, Fig. 1, B and C). Region II (green) does not have any corresponding residues in the yeast γ-subunit and is thus not present in the model. To test the importance of each of these regions in the redox regulation, four chimeric constructs were made in which the regions of the chloroplast γ-subunit were inserted at the corresponding regions of the yeast γ-subunit. These four chimeric constructs correspond to insertion or replacement of regions: (II), (I, II), (II, III), and (I, II, III). The four constructs were made in yeast using homologous recombination, which allowed the precise insertion of these regions within the gene. The chimeric gene constructs were transformed into a yeast strain devoid of the genes encoding the γ-subunit (ATP3) and that encoding the β-subunit (ATP2). The resulting strains were transformed with the gene encoding a His6 tagged derivative of the ATP2 gene. The atp2- mutation was necessary because yeast with an atp3- mutation rapidly become petite (loss or deletion of the mitochondrial DNA), which prevents biochemical analysis of the ATP synthase. However, the percentage of petites formed is dramatically reduced in the atp2-, atp3- double mutant strain and low in the atp2- mutant strain (33Lai-Zhang J. Xiao Y. Mueller D.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 58-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The His6 derivative of ATP2 also allows rapid purification of the F1-ATPase or the F1F0-ATPase for biochemical studies. Supplemental Table S1 shows a list of all of the strains used in this study. Fig. 2 shows the growth of the yeast cells on complete medium containing glycerol as the carbon source (YPG) or minimal medium with glucose as the carbon source (synthetic media). Cells defective in oxidative phosphorylation are unable to grow on YPG medium, but can grow on medium with glucose as a carbon source. The results indicate that insertion of region (II) alone did not alter the cells' ability for growth on YPG medium, whereas insertion of regions (I, II) had a modest negative affect, insertion of regions (II, III) had a moderate affect, and insertion of regions (I, II, III) eliminated the ability of the cell to grow on YPG medium. To determine whether the Cys residues in region II were responsible for the defect in chimera (I, II, III), these residues were mutated to Ser and tested in the same manner. Replacement of Cys with Ser in the largest chimeric construct (I, II, III) (C225S,C231S) restored the ability of the cell to grow on YPG. This result indicates that the insertion of regions (I, II, III), but not any of the smaller inserts, inactivated oxidative phosphorylation in the yeast strain. Furthermore, cysteine residues at the positions that correspond to chloroplast Cys199 and Cys205, are required for the inactivation of oxidative phosphorylation. The ATPase activity was measured for the wild-type and mutant mitochondrial F1-ATPase in the isolated mitochondria, the chloroform released enzyme, purified F1, and in some cases, the F1F0-ATP synthase (Table 1). The results indicate that the total activity was reduced by about 60% for the yeast strain containing (I, II, III), with a corresponding decrease in oligomycin sensitivity. The F1-ATPase is selectively released with chloroform extraction and releases only assembled enzyme (34Cheng M.Y. Hartl F.U. Martin J. Pollock R.A. Kalousek F. Neupert W. Hallberg E.M. Hallberg R.L. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1989; 337: 620-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The total activity of the chloroform-released enzyme from chimera (I, II, III) mirrored the activity of the isolated mitochondria supporting the conclusion that the ATPase activity is from the F1-ATPase. In contrast, the level of the ATPase activity from the mitochondria isolated from the remaining mutant strains, and the corresponding chloroform-released enzyme, were not decreased by more than 25% compared with the wild-type strain. The mitochondrial enzyme showed a corresponding small decrease in oligomycin sensitivity. Surprisingly, in comparison to the wild-type enzyme, oxidation with CuCl2 did not largely inhibit the ATPase activity relative to reduction with DTT. Separate experiments using purified F1-ATPase from the HSY205 indicated that disulfide bond formation occurred readily between the cysteines in the regulatory region (not shown).TABLE 1ATPase activities of the chimeric enzymesStrainRegionMito% OligoCHCl3F1F1F0KmWTNA1.1 (25%)9510.7 (18%)1158.059HSY205II0.78 (11%)8812.1 (25%)83NDNDHSY203I, II0.72 (3%)9012.8 (7%)87NDNDHSY204I, II, III0.39 (35%)564.5 (21%)9213.867 (105)HSY206II, III0.72 (31%)676.5 (17%)63NDNDHSY204C2SI, II, III0.778710.67812.9ND Open table in a new tab The F1 and F1F0-ATPase were purified from the strains to determine whether the specific activities of the enzymes were altered with the insertion of the chloroplast regions (Table 1). The ATPase activity from the F1 purified from the chimera strain (I, II, III) did not decrease by more than 20% as compared with the wild-type enzyme. The specific ATPase activity of F1F0 isolated from chimera (I, II, III) was not lower than that of either the wild-type or the C2S chimera strain (HSY204C2S). The largest alteration was in the Km for ATP of the chimeric F1F0-ATP synthase. It was about twice that for the (I, II, III) mutant enzyme (105 μm) as compared with that of the wild-type strain (59 μm) (when measured under oxidizing conditions) and this difference was eliminated after reduction with DTT. Thus, based on these studies, the activities of F1 and F1F0 were not largely altered by the insertion of the chloroplast regulatory region (I, II, III). Selective Decrease in Cytochrome c Oxidase Activity—Prior studies have indicated that the activity of the ATP synthase must be decreased by more than 85% before there is a negative growth phenotype on YPG medium (35Mukhopadhyay A. Uh M. Mueller D.M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The biochemical studies of the chimeric yeast/chloroplast enzyme (I, II, III) indicated that the activity of this enzyme was not nearly sufficiently inhibited to be responsible for the negative growth phenotype. Thus, studies were performed to determine whether there were defects in any of the enzymes of the electron transport chain, which may be responsible for the inability of the yeast to grow on medium containing a nonfermentable carbon source. Specific activities were determined for NADH dehydrogenase, cytochrome c reductase, and cytochrome c oxidase (Table 2). The results indicate that cytochrome c oxidase activity is decreased by nearly 95% in the HSY204 strain (I, II, III), but activity is decreased by just 35% when the Cys225 and Cys231 are replaced with Ser (HSY204C2S).TABLE 2Activity measurements of respiratory enzyme complexesStrainNADH dehydrogenaseCytochrome c reductaseCytochrome c oxidaseWild-type0.401.82903HSY2040.411.2169HSY204C2S0.582.41873 Open table in a new tab Studies were performed to determine whether the decrease in cytochrome c oxidase activity was due to an inhibition of the activity leaving an assembled and stable complex or if the cytochrome c oxidase is absent from the mitochondria. Fig. 3A shows difference spectra of mitochondria isolated from the corresponding wild-type and mutant strains. The spectra indicate that heme aa3 is largely reduced in the HSY204 strain containing the regulatory region (I, II, III), at near normal levels in the HSY204C2S strain. In contrast, cytochromes b, c, and c1 were at normal levels in the HSY204 strain (I, II, III). Fig. 3B shows the Western blot analysis used to determine whether the subunits of cytochrome c oxidase are present in the HSY204 strain (I, II, III). The results indicate that Cox2p and Cox3p were both decreased but the percentage decrease was not consistent with the observed decrease in cytochrome c oxidase activity. The Western blot also demonstrates that the level of the α- and β-subunits of the ATPase are decreased in the HSY204 strain (I, II, III), but not by more than about 50%. Analysis of the level of heme and activity of cytochrome c oxidase were measured from mitochondria isolated from strains HSY203, HSY205, and HSY206, and the levels were consistent with their growth phenotype on YPG medium (supplemental Fig. 2S). Association of Cytochrome c Oxidase with the ATP Synthase—The results suggest that the ATP synthase is either directly or indirectly associated with cytochrome c oxidase. To determine whether there is a direct association of cytochrome c oxidase with the ATP synthase, the ATP synthase was partially purified by nickel-affinity chromatography (using the His6 tag on the β-subunit) and analyzed for copurification of cytochrome c oxidase (Fig. 4). The results indicate that Cox2p and Cox3p of cytochrome c oxidase co-purified with the ATP synthase suggesting a direct interaction of cytochrome c oxidase with the ATP synthase. The control indicated that cytochrome c oxidase did not bind to the nickel-Sepharose column in the absence of the His6 tag on the ATP synthase. However, the association of ATP synthase and cytochrome c oxidase is not strong, as it is not observed when the mitochondrial membrane is treated with 1% dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (data not shown). Model of the Chloroplast Regulatory Loop—The conformation of region (I, II, III) within the context of the yeast γ-subunit and F1-ATPase was homology modeled using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE 2007.09, Chemical Computing Group, Inc., Montreal, Canada). In addition, a loop in the γ-subunit (residues 60-70) was modeled with MOE because this region is missing in the yeast model and the corresponding residues are also missing in the bovine model. The resulting model shown in Fig. 5 provides a framework within which to interpret the results. The regulatory region is on the face opposite the δ- and ϵ-subunits. The model shows that the regulatory region is capable of interacting with βE, βTP, and αTP. The model indicates that potentially, the regulatory region can interact with the catalytic and non-catalytic subunits of the ATPase and has the potential to insert into the interface between βE and αTP. The model places the two regulatory Cys residues at the end of a loop. This loop structure is similar to the redox loop in the periplasmic domain of the transmembrane electron transporter, DsbD (Protein Data Bank 1JPE) (36Haebel P.W. Goldstone D. Katzen F. Beckwith J. Metcalf P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4774-4784Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Like the chloroplast regulatory region, this redox loop undergoes oxidation/reduction of two cysteine residues, which are spaced similarly (residues 103 and 109 in DsbD). This model thus provides an explanation as to how this region might interact with the F1, altering the catalysis, and it explains potential specific requirements for interaction with the α- and β-subunits. There are two key advances resulting from this study. First, the results of this study indicate that the regulatory region with the γ-subunit of the ATP synthase is necessary, but not sufficient, for the redox regulation of the ATP synthase. In addition, the proposed model of this region, within the context of the structure of the yeast F1-ATPase, suggests an allosteric model for the regulatory role of this region. Second, the inactivation of cytochrome c oxidase by the introduction of this chloroplast regulatory region into the yeast ATP synthase suggests a direct interaction of the yeast ATP synthase in the assembly or function of cytochrome c oxidase. Prior studies suggested that this region is sufficient to confer redox regulation. Addition of the regulatory region into the γ-subunit of the F1-ATPase from cyanobacteria (37Krenn B.E. Aardewijn P. Van Walraven H.S. Werner-Grune S. Strotmann H. Kraayenhof R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and thermophylic bacteria (13Bald D. Noji H. Stumpp M.T. Yoshida M. Hisabori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12757-12762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) confers redox regulation. These studies suggested that the regulatory region was sufficient to confer redox regulation. However, the results of the chimeric enzyme made with the yeast enzyme indicate that more is required to confer redox regulation of the enzyme. Although the introduction of the cysteine containing regions, but not corresponding constructs containing serine, resulted in loss of oxidative phosphorylation in vivo, there was no demonstrable loss in the level or activity of the ATP synthase. Instead, as will be discussed later, the chimeric construct dramatically impaired cytochrome c oxidase. Introduction of the regulatory region into the γ-subunit had no dramatic effect on a number of biochemical parameters including the kinetics of ATP hydrolysis (Table 1), coupling as determined by oligomycin sensitivity (Table 1), and stability as measured by urea denaturation studies (data not shown). In addition, there was little effect on the enzyme activities and stability when compared between the oxidized and reduced forms. Thus, despite the results from the prior studies, the introduction of the chloroplast regulatory region in the yeast γ-subunit is not sufficient for the redox regulation of the enzyme. The model of the structure of the redox regulatory region in the context of the structure of the yeast F1-ATPase does suggest a number of possible regulatory mechanisms. The chloroplast regulatory region is within an antiparallel β-sheet topology formed by β-sheets 4 and 5 of the γ-subunit (Fig. 1). This sheet-4-loop-sheet-5 structure abuts against the C-terminal α-helix of the γ-subunit and may be important for the curvature of the coiled-coil structure formed by the N- and C-terminal α-helices. The curvature of the coiled-coil structure is in turn critical for the structure and function of the ATP synthase as the rotation within the core of the F1 is responsible for the changes in the conformation of the active sites during ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. The oxidation of the regulatory region may disrupt this β-sheet topology, thereby disrupting the coiled-coil structure and thus the structure of the active sites. Structural studies on the redox-regulated fructose-1,6-bisphosphate phosphatase suggests a similar mechanism where reduction of the disulfide bond releases the β1-β2 strands of an antiparallel sheet (38Chiadmi M. Navaza A. Miginiac-Maslow M. Jacquot J.P. Cherfils J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6809-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The model shown in Fig. 5 and supplemental Movie S1 suggests that the regulatory region is close to the catalytic interface formed by αTP and βTP. Thus, a second possible mechanism is that the regulatory loop moves into the interface and prevents the proper conformational changes during the catalytic cycle. This mechanism is similar to that proposed for the inhibitor protein that has been shown to bind to the catalytic βE interface of the bovine ATPase (39Cabezón E. Montgomery M.G. Leslie A.G.W. Walker J.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 744-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The model and mechanism proposed here differ considerably from an earlier model (12Samra H.S. Gao F. He F. Hoang E. Chen Z. Gegenheimer P.A. Berrie C.L. Richter M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31041-31049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 40Richter M.L. Samra H.S. He F. Giessel A.J. Kuczera K.K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2005; 37: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The prior model of the chloroplast regulatory region places it at the bottom of F1, far from the coiled-coil region of the γ-subunit. This prior model is dramatically different from the structure of other known structures of the F1-ATPase, including bovine, liver, and yeast mitochondrial, E. coli, and TF1. The prior model obviates any importance of the antiparallel β-sheet formed by sheets 4 and 5 and places a large structure at the base of the F1-ATPase. Any large structure placed at the base of F1, would likely impair interaction with the F0 components and rotation of the central stalk making this location unlikely. Finally, there are no easy explanations as to how redox regulation could occur if this regulatory element was so distant from either the central stalk or the active site of the enzyme. For these reasons, we favor the model proposed here over the prior model. The results of this study also provided the surprising finding that when introduced into yeast mitochondria, whereas the chloroplast regulatory region impairs oxidative phosphorylation, it impairs cytochrome c oxidase but not the ATP synthase or Complex I or III of the electron transport chain (Tables 1 and 2). This suggests that the ATP synthase either directly or indirectly interacts with cytochrome c oxidase. The interaction of the ATP synthase appears to be guided by interaction directly with the cysteine residues in the regulatory region, because serines at these positions have no effect. Alternatively, the oxidation of these sites might cause a conformational change that is required for the yet unidentified interaction. Although the conformational specific interaction seems unlikely, it is supported by the fact that the smaller chimeric constructs did not have that same effect on cytochrome c oxidase despite the presence of the cysteine residues. There have been other reports on the possible interaction of the ATP synthase with cytochrome c oxidase. Deletion of subunit g of the yeast ATP synthase has been shown to both decrease the formation of the dimer form of the ATP synthase and reduce the level of cytochrome c oxidase (20Boyle G.M. Roucou X. Nagley P. Devenish R.J. Prescott M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 41Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H.

In addition, electron paramagnetic resonance and differential scanning calorimetric studies have indicated a direct interaction between cytochrome c oxidase and the ATP synthase (43Qiu Z.H. Yu L. Yu C.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3297-3302Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, in conjunction with the results of this study, there is growing evidence that the ATP synthase interacts with cytochrome c oxidase, possibly forming a supercomplex. However, the results in this study still do not exclude the possibility that the reduction in cytochrome c oxidase is due to an interaction with a component involved in the assembly or synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase. Current studies are underway to clarify this further. We thank Rosemary Stuart for helpful discussion and the gifts of the antibodies. Download .zip (4.9 MB) Help with zip files"
