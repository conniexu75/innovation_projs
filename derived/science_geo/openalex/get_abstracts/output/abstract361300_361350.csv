https://openalex.org/W2007844697,"RNA polymerases are highly regulated molecular machines. We present a method (global run-on sequencing, GRO-seq) that maps the position, amount, and orientation of transcriptionally engaged RNA polymerases genome-wide. In this method, nuclear run-on RNA molecules are subjected to large-scale parallel sequencing and mapped to the genome. We show that peaks of promoter-proximal polymerase reside on ∼30% of human genes, transcription extends beyond pre-messenger RNA 3′ cleavage, and antisense transcription is prevalent. Additionally, most promoters have an engaged polymerase upstream and in an orientation opposite to the annotated gene. This divergent polymerase is associated with active genes but does not elongate effectively beyond the promoter. These results imply that the interplay between polymerases and regulators over broad promoter regions dictates the orientation and efficiency of productive transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2037686178,"Transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is thought to occur unidirectionally from most genes. Here, we present evidence of widespread divergent transcription at protein-encoding gene promoters. Transcription start site–associated RNAs (TSSa-RNAs) nonrandomly flank active promoters, with peaks of antisense and sense short RNAs at 250 nucleotides upstream and 50 nucleotides downstream of TSSs, respectively. Northern analysis shows that TSSa-RNAs are subsets of an RNA population 20 to 90 nucleotides in length. Promoter-associated RNAPII and H3K4-trimethylated histones, transcription initiation hallmarks, colocalize at sense and antisense TSSa-RNA positions; however, H3K79-dimethylated histones, characteristic of elongating RNAPII, are only present downstream of TSSs. These results suggest that divergent transcription over short distances is common for active promoters and may help promoter regions maintain a state poised for subsequent regulation."
https://openalex.org/W1968165696,"Differences in the amount of fetal hemoglobin (HbF) that persists into adulthood affect the severity of sickle cell disease and the β-thalassemia syndromes. Genetic association studies have identified sequence variants in the gene BCL11A that influence HbF levels. Here, we examine BCL11A as a potential regulator of HbF expression. The high-HbF BCL11A genotype is associated with reduced BCL11A expression. Moreover, abundant expression of full-length forms of BCL11A is developmentally restricted to adult erythroid cells. Down-regulation of BCL11A expression in primary adult erythroid cells leads to robust HbF expression. Consistent with a direct role of BCL11A in globin gene regulation, we find that BCL11A occupies several discrete sites in the β-globin gene cluster. BCL11A emerges as a therapeutic target for reactivation of HbF in β-hemoglobin disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1999808854,"Studies have shown that the bulk of eukaryotic genomes is transcribed. Transcriptome maps are frequently updated, but low-abundant transcripts have probably gone unnoticed. To eliminate RNA degradation, we depleted the exonucleolytic RNA exosome from human cells and then subjected the RNA to tiling microarray analysis. This revealed a class of short, polyadenylated and highly unstable RNAs. These promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs) are produced ∼0.5 to 2.5 kilobases upstream of active transcription start sites. PROMPT transcription occurs in both sense and antisense directions with respect to the downstream gene. In addition, it requires the presence of the gene promoter and is positively correlated with gene activity. We propose that PROMPT transcription is a common characteristic of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcribed genes with a possible regulatory potential."
https://openalex.org/W2037064308,"Transcription in mammalian cells can be assessed at a genome-wide level, but it has been difficult to reliably determine whether individual transcripts are derived from the plus or minus strands of chromosomes. This distinction can be critical for understanding the relationship between known transcripts (sense) and the complementary antisense transcripts that may regulate them. Here, we describe a technique that can be used to (i) identify the DNA strand of origin for any particular RNA transcript, and (ii) quantify the number of sense and antisense transcripts from expressed genes at a global level. We examined five different human cell types and in each case found evidence for antisense transcripts in 2900 to 6400 human genes. The distribution of antisense transcripts was distinct from that of sense transcripts, was nonrandom across the genome, and differed among cell types. Antisense transcripts thus appear to be a pervasive feature of human cells, which suggests that they are a fundamental component of gene regulation."

Compounds of this nature exert carcinogenic and endocrine-disrupting effects in experimental animals by binding to the orphan aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Understanding the mechanism of action of these pollutants, as well as the physiological role(s) of the AhR, requires identification of the endogenous ligand(s) of this receptor. We reported earlier that activation of AhR by ultraviolet radiation is mediated by the chromophoric amino acid tryptophan (Trp), and we suggested that a new class of compounds derived from Trp, in particular 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ), acts as natural high affinity ligands for this receptor. Here we describe seven new FICZ-derived indolo[3,2-b]carbazole-6-carboxylic acid metabolites and two sulfoconjugates, and we demonstrate the following. (i) FICZ is formed efficiently by photolysis of Trp upon exposure to visible light. (ii) FICZ is an exceptionally good substrate for cytochromes P450 (CYP) 1A1, 1A2, and 1B1, and its hydroxylated metabolites are remarkably good substrates for the sulfotransferases (SULTs) 1A1, 1A2, 1B1, and 1E1. Finally, (iii) sulfoconjugates of phenolic metabolites of FICZ are present in human urine. Our findings indicate that formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazols are the most potent naturally occurring activators of the AhR signaling pathway and may be the key substrates of the CYP1 and SULT1 families of enzymes.

However, despite intensive studies, this physiological role and the endogenous activators of the AhR remain to be elucidated (3Nguyen L.P. Bradfield C.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol... 2008; 21: 102-116Google Scholar). At the cellular level, activated AhR interacts with various signal transduction pathways; induces biotransformation enzymes; alters the cell cycle, cell adhesion, and migration; and causes apoptosis or aberrant cell growth (4Elferink C.J.

In vivo, the AhR plays significant roles in connection with development, immunological and reproductive functions, and adaptive responses to light and xenobiotics (8Baba T. Mimura J. Nakamura N.

The AhR protein has been shown to bind the compound 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) as well as similar highly lipophilic halogenated and non-halogenated hydrocarbons leading to cardiovascular, carcinogenic, and endocrine effects (12Fernandez-Salguero P.M.

A... 2000; 97: 779-782Google Scholar). Consequently, most studies designed to explore the functions of this receptor have been performed with TCDD. One remarkable feature of activation of AhR by dioxin-like compounds is sustained induction of both cytochromes P450 and other metabolizing enzymes, whereas other agonists cause only transient induction of these enzymes. It seems likely that for purposes of regulation, endogenous ligands of AhR are metabolized rapidly, so that the use of persistent xenobiotics such as dioxins to investigate this receptor might be inappropriate. A striking discrepancy between the effects of different types of AhR activators was made evident in two recent studies (17Quintana F.J. Basso A.S. Iglesias A.H. Korn T. Farez M.F. Bettelli E. Caccamo M. Oukka M. Weiner H.L. Nature.. 2008; 453: 65-71Google Scholar, 18Veldhoen M. Hirota K. Westendorf A.M. Buer J. Dumoutier L. Renauld J.C. Stockinger B. Nature.. 2008; 453: 106-109Google Scholar). The authors showed that FICZ, the suggested physiologic AhR ligand, boosted TH17-cell differentiation and worsened the experimentally induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis, whereas TCDD increased levels of Treg and suppressed the pathological effects in myelin-immunized mice. Many endogenous compounds, including various indoles, heme, and arachidonic acid metabolites, have also been found to be AhR agonists, and Trp is the precursor for many of the most active ligands (3Nguyen L.P. Bradfield C.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol... 2008; 21: 102-116Google Scholar). Indeed, FICZ, which is formed upon exposure of solutions of Trp (19Rannug A. Rannug U. Rosenkranz H.S. Winquist L. Westerholm R.

Grafström A.-K. J. Biol. Chem... 1987; 262: 15422-15427Google Scholar), as well as all other substances tested previously (3Nguyen L.P. Bradfield C.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol... 2008; 21: 102-116Google Scholar). The Kd value for FICZ is 0.07 nm, which is 2 or more orders of magnitude lower than for prostaglandin and lipoxin derivatives also suggested as physiological AhR ligands (22Nebert D.W. Karp C.L. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 36061-36065Google Scholar). FICZ up-regulates the expression of AhR-responsive genes efficiently and transiently and is rapidly metabolized in a feedback manner (23Wei Y.D. Bergander L. Rannug U. Rannug A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys... 2000; 383: 99-107Google Scholar). This sequence of events typical for autoregulatory loops in biological signaling indicates that this compound may be a physiological ligand for AhR. The purpose of this work was to characterize the light-dependent formation of FICZ, its metabolism by human enzymes, and to document the presence of stable metabolites of FICZ in humans. Chemicals—Of the five new compounds used as standards, compound 8-SO4-FICZ was enzymatically produced (this study); the chemical synthesis of 2-SO4-FICZ is unpublished, and the synthesis of indolo[3,2-b]carbazole-6-carboxylic acid (CICZ), 2-OH-CICZ, and 2,8-dOH-CICZ (purity >98%) has been described in detail elsewhere (24Wahlström N. Romero I. Bergman J. J. Org. Chem... 2004; 273: 2593-2602Google Scholar). Irradiation of Trp—For irradiation of Trp the following settings were utilized: visible light, a normal 100-watt bulb for 90 min at a distance of 18 cm (1.4 J/s m2); UVA1-Osram UltraMed 400 W with a 4.5-mm security glass heat filter and a blue glass filter (UG1 2 mm) for 20 min at a distance of 18 cm (90 J/s m2); and UVB-70 W UV240 DT, IP20, 2 Philips PL 36-W tubes for 15 min at a distance of 28 cm (1 J/s m2). 100-ml aliquots of an aqueous solution of 80 μm Trp were irradiated. Following irradiation, the solutes were concentrated by solid-phase extraction (SPE; SepPak®) and analyzed for the presence of FICZ by HPLC. Metabolic Systems—Pooled human liver S9 fractions were purchased from MOLTOX™ (Molecular Toxicology Inc.) and used to obtain cytosolic and microsomal fractions by centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 60 min. Metabolism studies were performed according to Ref. 25Bergander L. Wincent E. Rannug A. Foroozesh M. Alworth W. Rannug U. Chem. Biol. Interact... 2004; 149: 151-164Google Scholar. Three bicistronic plasmids encoding human NADPH-P450 reductase together with CYP enzymes 1A1, 1A2, or 1B1 were a generous gift from Dr. Fred Guengerich (Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville). The CYP1 enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α, and bacterial membranes containing the recombinant enzymes were prepared according to the procedure described by Guengerich and co-workers (26Guengerich F.P. Martin M.V. Guo Z. Chun Y.-J. Methods Enzymol.. 1996; 272: 35-44Google Scholar). The levels of CYP1 proteins in the preparations were calculated on the basis of the carbon monoxide (CO) difference spectra (27Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem... 1964; 239: 2370-2378Google Scholar). 7-Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and 7-methoxyresorufin-O-demethylase activities were determined by the standard procedures described by Burke and Mayer (28Burke M.D. Mayer R.T. Drug Metab. Dispos... 1974; 2: 583-588Google Scholar). The kinetic properties of CYP1A1, -1A2, and -1B1 with FICZ as a substrate were determined on the basis of the decrease in fluorescence (λex = 460 nm, λem = 520 nm) with time. Membrane preparations containing the different CYP1 enzymes were incubated separately with different concentrations of FICZ (ranging from 0.125 to 52.0 μm) at 37 °C in a mixture containing 25 nm CYP, 0.5 mm NADPH, 48 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), and 0.96 mm EDTA (final concentrations). Antibodies used to investigate the importance of CYP1 enzymes in FICZ metabolism in human liver microsomal fractions were CYP1A1/1A2 inhibitory antibody (anti-rat CYP1A2 number 458131) and CYP1B1 antiserum (WB-rat number 458511) from BD Biosciences. Human SULTs were expressed in Salmonella typhimurium TA1538, and cytosolic preparations obtained from these bacteria were prepared according to Meinl and co-workers (29Meinl W. Meerman J.H. Glatt H. Pharmacogenetics.. 2002; 12: 677-689Google Scholar). The levels of SULTs in the bacterial cytosolic fractions were determined based on immunoblots (supplemental Fig. S1) with homogeneous enzyme proteins as standards (29Meinl W. Meerman J.H. Glatt H. Pharmacogenetics.. 2002; 12: 677-689Google Scholar). Cytosolic preparations containing the different SULT enzymes were incubated separately with different concentrations of substrate (ranging from 0.0125 to 40.4 μm) in a mixture containing 0.02–0.1 μm SULT and 0.1 mm 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate in 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) (final concentrations). The kinetic properties with 2- and 8-OH-FICZ as substrates were determined on the basis of the increase in fluorescence (λex = 390 nm; λem = 525 nm) with time. For the kinetic studies the total cytosolic fraction, rather than the purified SULT enzymes, was employed because these enzymes are more stable in the presence of this fraction. Furthermore, other compounds in the cytosolic fraction rapidly degrade the de-sulfonated form, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphate, of the cofactor, which is a potent inhibitor of SULTs. All kinetic measurements were performed utilizing a GENios PRO plate reader (Tecan), and the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software was employed to calculate the kinetic constants (Km, kcat, and Ki) in accordance with the substrate inhibition model. Cell Culture Conditions and Treatments—HepG2 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The HepG2-derived cell line HepG2-XRE-Luc containing the stable pTX.DIR luciferase reporter with two rat XRE1 elements (30Berghard A. Gradin K. Pongratz I. Whitelaw M. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1993; 13: 677-689Google Scholar) was cultured in the same medium with addition of 800 μg/ml geneticin. All media and supplements were from Invitrogen. 1.4 × 106 HepG2 cells were seeded into 60-mm dishes and treated with FICZ (5 nm), α-naphthoflavone (αNF, 5 μm), and a combination of FICZ and αNF. The cells were briefly washed with phosphate-buffered saline, harvested in 850 μl of distilled H2O, and sonicated on ice for FICZ determinations by HPLC. For studies of AhR activation of the HepG2-XRE-Luc, cells were plated into 12-well plates and grown to 70–80% confluence before treatment. The medium was replaced with fresh medium, containing the AhR ligands dissolved in DMSO (final concentration 0.1% (v/v)). At the indicated time points, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured in 30 μl of cell extract according to the manufacturer's protocol (BioThema, Handen, Sweden). Luciferase activity was normalized to protein values determined with the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). AhR Activating Capacities—The AhR activating capacities of the different indolo[3,2-b]carbazols were compared with TCDD using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based Ah-IMMUNOASSAY® (Biosense Laboratories, Norway) according to the manufacturers protocol. The same range of concentrations was used for all compounds (10–2500 pm). Chemical Analyses—Some samples were concentrated prior to analysis by HPLC using external or on-line SPE (SepPak® or restricted access materials columns), whereas others were injected directly. The HPLC separation was achieved on a 250-mm long, 5-μm particle size reverse phase C18 column using a 40-min linear mobile phase gradient from 45% B to 100% B (A, 1.5 mm formic acid in H2O; B, 1.5 mm formic acid in acetonitrile) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Both CICZ and FICZ were analyzed using fluorescence detection. Urine samples were sterilized by filtration and extracted with SPE. The LC/MS/MS separation of the sulfonated compounds was achieved on a 150-mm long, 1.8-μm particle size reverse phase C18 column. The temperature was elevated to 80 °C to reduce the viscosity of the mobile phase, which allowed the use of a conventional HPLC pump to obtain an acceptable flow rate. A gradient of 5–60% methanol was applied over a period of 30 min at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min, and the separation was followed by negative electrospray ionization. Formic acid at a final concentration of 20 mm was added to the mobile phase to eliminate fluctuations in pH and variation in the retention times of the acidic sulfates. The MS detection was performed in the enhanced product ion mode, where the selected precursor ions (monosulfated metabolites, m/z 379) were isolated and fragmented at particular collision energy. For negative electrospray ionization, the following settings were utilized: curtain gas 40 p.s.i., gas1 30 p.s.i., gas2 40 p.s.i., ion spray voltage –4500 V, temperature 450 °C, declustering potential –40 V, entrance potential –10 V, and collision energy –70 V. Formation of Photoproducts—Our earlier findings (21Oberg M. Bergander L. Hakansson H. Rannug U. Rannug A. Toxicol. Sci... 2005; 85: 935-943Google Scholar), as well as those of others (31Diani-Moore S. Labitzke E. Brown R. Garvin A. Wong L. Rifkind A.B. Toxicol. Sci... 2006; 90: 96-110Google Scholar), indicate that exposure of Trp to visible light results in the formation of FICZ. In those studies the contribution of UV light could not be unequivocally excluded. Here we quantitatively compared the formation of this compound upon irradiation with visible light with the amounts formed following UVA and UVB irradiation (Table 1). Exposure of 80 μm aqueous solution of Trp to light from a regular 100-W bulb for 20 min yielded 9.5 pmol of FICZ. Per unit of energy (joule), UVB was the most efficient in generating FICZ. 40–400-Fold increases in FICZ formation were observed in the presence of the photosensitizer riboflavin (vitamin B12), especially in the case of UVA and visible light because, in contrast to Trp, riboflavin absorbs light efficiently at these longer wavelengths. This relatively easy conversion of Trp to FICZ in the presence of riboflavin and light suggests that the same process could occur, e.g. in the skin, and that the formation of FICZ could probably explain the reported UV-dependent activation of CYP1 enzymes in human skin (32Katiyar S.K. Matsui M.S. Mukhtar H. J. Investig. Dermatol... 2000; 114: 328-333Google Scholar).TABLE 1Formation of FICZ by lightLight sourceFICZ formed- Riboflavin+ Riboflavinpmolfmol/Jpmolfmol/JVisible light9.5 ± 1.61.3 ± 0.21140 ± 135150 ± 18UVA2.5 ± 0.30.03 ± 0.0031000 ± 3012.3 ± 0.4UVB13.6 ± 1.7011.3 ± 1.40512 ± 15427 ± 13 Open table in a new tab Metabolism—Subsequently, we examined the major pathways of FICZ (1) metabolism and determined the principal enzymes involved in order, among other things, to know which metabolites to look for in human urine. An S9 fraction prepared from human liver catalyzed mono- and di-hydroxylation of the ring moieties, as well as oxidation of the aldehyde group. Seven previously unknown metabolites (5, 6a–c, and 7a–c) were detected employing LC/MS/MS and their structures determined by LC/MS/MS (Fig. 1, A and B). Metabolites 5, 6a, and 7a (designated h1, h3, and h5 in Ref. 25Bergander L. Wincent E. Rannug A. Foroozesh M. Alworth W. Rannug U. Chem. Biol. Interact... 2004; 149: 151-164Google Scholar) showed the same mass fragmentation pattern as the authentic standards CICZ, 2-OH-CICZ, and 2,8-dOH-CICZ, respectively (see supplemental Fig. S2). Although 2, 6c, 7b, and 7c (designated MA, h2, h4, and h6 in Ref. 25Bergander L. Wincent E. Rannug A. Foroozesh M. Alworth W. Rannug U. Chem. Biol. Interact... 2004; 149: 151-164Google Scholar) did not match any of the standards available, analysis by LC/MS/MS together with their UV spectra, molecular weight, fragmentation patterns, and comparison with the product-precursor relationships revealed the molecular structures shown in Fig. 1B. 2 exhibited the same molecular weight (300) and MS/MS fragments as the other monohydroxylated FICZ metabolites but was less stable, suggesting hydroxylation on the nitrogen atom. 6b co-eluted with 4b (2,10-dOH-FICZ). On the basis of its Mr 316 and pattern of fragmentation as well as different retention times in the extracted ion chromatograms, 6b was identified as a monohydroxylated derivative of CICZ. Without addition of the cofactor NADPH and/or when employing the cytosolic fraction from human liver S9, oxidation of the aldehyde moiety was the only metabolism that occurred. This reaction converted FICZ to CICZ (5) and the hydroxylated FICZ metabolites to the corresponding hydroxylated metabolites of CICZ (6a, c and 7a–c). The independence of NAD(P)H for formation of CICZ, the cytosolic localization, and the inhibition of FICZ oxidation by the aldehyde oxidase inhibitor menadione (supplemental Fig. S3) but not by the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol (data not shown) strongly suggest that oxidation of the aldehyde moiety is catalyzed by aldehyde oxidase. By HPLC analyses we could demonstrate the primary role of the first family of cytochrome P450 enzymes, CYP1, in catalyzing FICZ catabolism both in human liver microsomes incubated with antibodies specific toward CYP1 and in human hepatoma HepG2 cells treated with the highly efficient chemical CYP1 inhibitor αNF (Fig. 2, A and B). A 20-min preincubation with a mixture of CYP1A1/1A2 and CYP1B1 antibodies inhibited almost completely (93%) the NADPH-dependent FICZ metabolism (Fig. 2A). The inhibiting capacity of the antibodies was confirmed by inhibition of the EROD activity by 98% (supplemental Fig. S4). The complete and rapid depletion of intracellular levels of FICZ seen in FICZ-treated HepG2 cells was attenuated when αNF was added (Fig. 2B). This CYP1 inhibitor gave rise to a prolonged AhR activation in HepG2 cells. It caused a sustained luciferase reporter response in contrast to the transient responses seen in control incubations or in incubations with FICZ alone (Fig. 2C). Thus, the inhibitor behaved as an AhR agonist in these experiments. In parallel, we showed that αNF behaved as an antagonist when added together with TCDD (supplemental Fig. S5). The observed prolonged AhR response when the CYP1A1 enzyme was inhibited with αNF is in accordance with our earlier demonstration that mouse Hepa-1 cells (c37) lacking functional CYP1A1 enzyme exhibit a higher constitutive CYP1A1 expression and respond to FICZ treatment with sustained up-regulation of CYP1A1 expression (23Wei Y.D. Bergander L. Rannug U. Rannug A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys... 2000; 383: 99-107Google Scholar). Higher constitutive CYP1A1 mRNA levels in CYP1A1-deficient mouse Hepa-1 cell clones and African green monkey kidney CV-1 cells had also been reported by others (33Chang C.Y. Puga A. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1998; 18: 525-535Google Scholar, 34Hankinson O. Andersen R.D. Birren B.W. Sander F. Negishi M. Nebert D.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1985; 260: 1790-1795Google Scholar) These investigators had shown that constitutive activity of the AhR-ARNT transcriptional complexes was regulated by the catalytic activity of the CYP1A1 enzyme. They pointed out the possibility that endogenous CYP1A1 substrates could be the AhR activators in the absence of exogenous ligands. Our results suggest that FICZ is such an endogenous ligand, which is efficiently metabolized by CYP1A1. This provides a likely mechanistic explanation for the earlier reported phenomena. Enzyme Kinetics—To examine the efficiency with which the CYP1 enzymes metabolize FICZ, we compared the rates of hydroxylation of this compound to the standard EROD and methoxyresorufin-O-demethylase activities using human recombinant CYP1 enzymes expressed in E. coli. The catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) were found to be 5–50-fold higher for FICZ than for these standard substrates (Fig. 3 and Table 2) and at least 5000-fold higher compared with the hydroxylation of estrogens (35Badawi A.F. Cavalieri E.L. Rogan E.G. Metab. Clin. Exp... 2001; 50: 1001-1003Google Scholar, 36Lee A.J. Cai M.X. Thomas P.E. Conney A.H. Zhu B.T. Endocrinology.. 2003; 144: 3382-3398Google Scholar). CYP1A1 catalyzed hydroxylation of FICZ extremely efficiently, with kcat/Km of 8.1 × 107m–1 s–1, which is similar to the corresponding value of 8.3 × 107m–1 s–1 for the highly efficient carbonic anhydrase (37Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman & Co, New York1999: 164Google Scholar). The catalytic efficiency for FICZ as a CYP1A1 substrate is close to the limit of diffusion, and therefore FICZ is an excellent CYP1A1 substrate. FICZ is also a very good substrate for CYP1A2 and CYP1B1.TABLE 2Kinetic properties of recombinant human CYP1A1, -1A2, and -1B1EnzymeSubstratekcatKmKikcat/Kmmin-1μmμm(m-1 s-1) × 107CYP1A1FICZ257 ± 120.053 ± 0.01215.4 ± 3.708.10 ± 1.10EOR22.7 ± 3.40.24 ± 0.071.80 ± 0.520.16 ± 0.03CYP1A2FICZ367 ± 440.89 ± 0.173.90 ± 1.000.69 ± 0.09MOR33.2 ± 5.00.31 ± 0.080.98 ± 0.230.18 ± 0.03CYP1B1FICZ174 ± 100.21 ± 0.0413.3 ± 3.001.40 ± 0.16EOR36.4 ± 5.20.23 ± 0.060.98 ± 0.230.27 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab We then investigated whether the hydroxylated metabolites of FICZ are in turn good substrates for conjugating enzymes. Our earlier findings indicated that sulfoconjugation is an important pathway in this context (25Bergander L. Wincent E. Rannug A. Foroozesh M. Alworth W. Rannug U. Chem. Biol. Interact... 2004; 149: 151-164Google Scholar). Such conjugation of exogenous and endogenous compounds generates water-soluble sulfuric acid esters that are excreted in the urine. Therefore, sulfation of the primary hydroxylated FICZ metabolites 3a and 3b by six human recombinant sulfotransferases (SULT1A1, -1A2, -1A3, -1B1, -1E1, and -2A1) was studied in detail. Although SULT1A3 and -2A1 did not catalyze any conjugation (data not shown), the other four SULTs all exhibited high catalytic efficiencies. In all four cases the 2-hydroxylated metabolite 3b was more efficiently conjugated than the 8-hydroxylated metabolite 3a (Fig. 4 and Table 3). With a kcat/Km of 1.1 × 107m–1 s–1 with 3b as substrate, SULT1A2 exhibited the highest efficiency. This value is higher than for any other substrate and human SULT form reported in the literature (38Dajani R. Sharp S. Graham S. Bethell S.S. Cooke R.M. Jamieson D.J. Coughtrie M.W.

In this connection it could be added that kcat/Km for the analgesic and antipyretic drug paracetamol for which sulfation is an important pathway in the elimination of the drug is 4 orders of magnitude lower. 4H. R. Glatt, unpublished results. Furthermore, the dihydroxylated metabolites 4a–c were converted to disulfuric acid esters by SULT 1A1, -1A2, and -1B1, with intermediate formation of the monosulfoconjugates (not shown). Because sulfation of monohydroxylated metabolites of FICZ occurs rapidly and the second sulfation of dihydroxylated metabolites is less favorable, monosulfates would appear to be most likely to be excreted in the urine.TABLE 3Kinetic properties of recombinant human SULT1A1, -1A2, -1B1, and -1E1EnzymeSubstratekcatKmKikcat/Kmmin-1μmμm(m-1 s-1) × 106SULT1A12-OH-FICZ99.3 ± 3.70.25 ± 0.023.1 ± 0.36.62 ± 0.298-OH-FICZ12.3 ± 1.40.35 ± 0.082.6 ± 0.60.59 ± 0.074-Nitrophenol18 ± 21.1 ± 0.20.3 ± 0.0SULT1A22-OH-FICZ91.6 ± 8.20.14 ± 0.020.36 ± 0.0510.9 ± 0.918-OH-FICZ48.5 ± 4.40.70 ± 0.117.0 ± 1.71.15 ± 0.11SULT1B12-OH-FICZ7.90 ± 0.500.03 ± 0.012.10 ± 0.404.39 ± 0.378-OH-FICZ12.3 ± 0.40.07 ± 0.0114.8 ± 2.32.93 ± 0.11SULT1E12-OH-FICZ12.2 ± 1.40.51 ± 0.103.2 ± 0.60.40 ± 0.038-OH-FICZ58.6 ± 13.74.0 ± 1.46.6 ± 2.50.3 ± 0.017β-estradiol1.3 ± 0.10.005 ± 0.0010.013 ± 0.0044.3 ± 0.5 Open table in a new tab AhR Activation—The key events involved in the processes regulated by AhR are activation of this receptor by ligand binding and subsequent binding of a complex consisting of the activated receptor and accessory proteins to specific responsive elements (XREs) in genes, thereby triggering their transcription.

Biophys... 2000; 383: 99-107Google Scholar) reflects rapid metabolism of this compound to derivatives with little or no affinity for AhR. When the capacities of FICZ and eight of its metabolites to activate this receptor were compared with those of the high affinity ligands 6,12-diformylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (dFICZ), ICZ, and TCDD employing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the three indolo[3,2-b]carbazoles FICZ, ICZ, and dFICZ produced the greatest activation, as expected, with FICZ being almost twice as potent in this respect as TCDD (Table 4). Interestingly, one of the primary hydroxylated metabolites, 8-OH-FICZ, demonstrated approximately the same potency as TCDD, whereas all of the other metabolites were less potent, and the monosulfate conjugate (i.e. the end product) produced no detectable activation.TABLE 4The AhR activating capacities of different indolo[3,2-b]carbazols compared to TCDDCompoundRelative capacity to activate AhRTCDD1FICZ1.89 ± 0.04dFICZ1.17 ± 0.09ICZ1.48 ± 0.072-OH-FICZ0.43 ± 0.068-OH-FICZ0.93 ± 0.052,10-dOH-FICZ0.053 ± 0.0034,8-dOH-FICZ0.035 ± 0.0032,8-dOH-FICZND2-SO4-FICZNDCICZ0.044 ± 0.0042-OH-CICZ0.006 ± 0.001 Open table in a new tab Presence of FICZ Metabolites in Humans—To demonstrate that FICZ actually occurs in humans, we analyzed seven 24-h urine samples (200–700 ml) by LC/MS/MS. Standards, urine samples, and spiked samples were analyzed in an identical fashion, and the retention times and fragmentation patterns were compared. To obtain maximal MS sensitivity, through the selection of precursor ions having the same m/z value, we focused primarily on monosulfated metabolites (Mr 380). 8-SO4-FICZ was present in two of the seven urine samples (peaks 9 and 13 in Fig. 5) with a signal to noise ratio of greater than 3, which is a requirement for identification. Several other compounds related to FICZ, i.e. having the same Mr 380 and MS fragments, whose chemical identities remain to be established, were also present in all the samples. The results indicate the presence of several FICZ-derived metabolites and also point to an individual variation in the metabolite profile. The reasons for such a variation are unknown but could reflect genotypeenvironment interactions. Conclusion—We conclude that sulfate-conjugated metabolites of FICZ are present in human urine, which indicates exposure to this remarkably active agonist of AhR. This insight into natural stimuli for AhR-mediated responses in humans motivates an extensive search for sources of FICZ, whether produced endogenously from Trp by photolytic or metabolic processes and/or taken up from the diet. Our kinetic data demonstrate that, in addition to being a potent activator of AhR and, thereby, inducer of CYP1 enzymes, FICZ is also an excellent substrate for CYP1A1. Furthermore, the hydroxylated metabolites of FICZ are remarkably good substrates for the SULT1 enzymes. Our findings have important experimental implications, because FICZ is present in cells in culture (9Fritsche E. Schafer C. Calles C. Bernsmann T. Bernshausen T. Wurm M. Hubenthal U. Cline J.E.

Thus, conditions that influence formation or metabolism of FICZ may lead to misinterpretation of experimental data. This could be demonstrated by treatment of cells with the CYP1 inhibitor αNF, which caused a prolongation of the normally transient AhR activation induced by FICZ treatment. Similarly, αNF treatment alone increased the AhR activation induced by the medium change, i.e. in this case αNF behaved like an agonist, although mechanistically it is an inhibitor of FICZ metabolism. Together with earlier observations of high constitutive CYP1A1 expression in metabolically deficient cells (23Wei Y.D. Bergander L. Rannug U. Rannug A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys... 2000; 383: 99-107Google Scholar, 34Hankinson O. Andersen R.D. Birren B.W. Sander F. Negishi M. Nebert D.W. J. Biol. Chem... 1985; 260: 1790-1795Google Scholar, 35Badawi A.F. Cavalieri E.L. Rogan E.G. Metab. Clin.

In summary, this study advances significantly our knowledge concerning the mechanisms of formation, biochemical properties, and metabolic fate of FICZ.

We report here the crystal structure of the lipase from Geobacillus thermocatenulatus, the first structure of a member of the lipase family I.5 showing an open configuration. Unexpectedly, enzyme activation involves large structural rearrangements of around 70 amino acids and the concerted movement of two lids, the α6- and α7-helices, unmasking the active site. Central in the restructuring process of the lids are both the transfer of bulky hydrophobic residues out of the N-terminal end of the α6-helix and the incorporation of short side chain residues to the α6 C-terminal end. All these structural changes are stabilized by the Zn2+-binding domain, which is characteristic of this family of lipases. Two detergent molecules are placed in the active site, mimicking chains of the triglyceride substrate, demonstrating the position of the oxyanion hole and the three pockets that accommodate the sn-1, sn-2, and sn-3 fatty acids chains. The combination of structural and biochemical studies indicate that the lid opening is not mediated by temperature but triggered by interaction with lipid substrate.

Lipases (triacylglycerol lipase EC 3.1.1.3) catalyze the hydrolysis of long-chain triacylglycerides at water/oil interfaces. They are very versatile enzymes because, in vitro, they catalyze both the hydrolysis and the synthesis of a great variety of esters (1Björkling F. Godtfredsen S.E. Kirk O. Trends Biotechnol. 1991; 9: 360-363Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 2Bornscheuer U.T.

Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 396-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Most lipases contain a lid domain controlling access to the active site (5Derewenda Z.S. Sharp A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 20-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The interaction of the enzyme with lipid aggregates induces the displacement of the lid, which makes the active site accessible to individual substrate molecules and increases the catalytic activity. This phenomenon is known as interfacial activation (5Derewenda Z.S. Sharp A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 20-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 6Sarda L. Desnuelle P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1958; 30: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar).Much of the interest in extremophiles stems from their surprising properties. There has been extensive research on the structural proteins and key metabolic enzymes that are responsible for the unusual properties of the organisms. Recent research has focused on the identification of extremozymes relevant for industrial biocatalysis. The bacterial thermoalkalophilic lipases are among the most biocatalytically relevant extremozymes due to their resistance to proteases, detergents, and chaotropic agents together with their extreme stability at elevated temperatures and in organic solvents (7Demirjian D.C. Moris-Varas F. Cassidy C.S. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2001; 5: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Thermoalkalophilic lipases are found in several thermophilic aerobic bacteria recently reclassified as the new genus Geobacillus (8Nazina T.N. Tourova T.P. Poltaraus A.B. Novikova E.V. Grigoryan A.A.

Lett. 1999; 21: 1003-1006Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thermoalkalophilic lipases show optimal activity at 60–75 °C and pH 8–10, share about 95% amino acid sequence identity among them, and show a significant similarity of 30–35% with the mature lipases from other Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus strains. In contrast to the similarity with staphylococcal lipases, the thermoalkalophilic lipases exhibit no sequence similarity with other microbial lipases (13Schmidt-Dannert C. Rua M.L. Schmid R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 284: 194-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). They are also characterized by their significantly larger molecular sizes (40–45 kDa) relative to other microbial lipases (usually under 35 kDa). Thus, the thermoalkalophilic lipases and staphylococcal lipases were originally grouped in one lipase family, named the lipase family I.5 (14Jaeger K.E. Dijkstra B.W. Reetz M.T. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 315-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar) or Staphylococcus family (13Schmidt-Dannert C. Rua M.L. Schmid R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 284: 194-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Later, because of their lower level of sequence similarity to the Geobacillus lipases, the Staphylococcus enzymes were re-assigned to family I.6 (15Jaeger K.E. Eggert T. Curr. Opin.

In those structures, lipases presented its closed conformation with the active site buried under a long lid helix. The structures exhibited a zinc-binding site in an extra domain accounting for the larger molecular size of the family I.5 enzymes in comparison to other microbial lipases.The thermophile G. thermocatenulatus produces two lipases (BTL1 and BTL2) with different sizes (13Schmidt-Dannert C. Rua M.L. Schmid R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 284: 194-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). BTL2 is a 43-kDa protein (predicted from the DNA sequence) that showed high stability at medium temperatures (50 °C), alkaline pH (9.0–11.0), and in organic solvents (2-propanol, acetone, methanol) (18Schmidt-Dannert C. Rua M.L. Atomi H. Schmid R.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that this lipase presents a high specificity toward very different substrates with a great selectivity in the resolution of key intermediates in the synthesis of drugs (19Palomo J.M. Penas M.M. Fernandez-Lorente G. Mateo C. Pisabarro A.G. Fernandez-Lafuente R. Ramirez L. Guisan J.M. Biomacromolecules. 2003; 4: 204-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Here, we report the crystal structure of the BTL2 in an open conformation with two molecules of Triton detergent present in the active site. Activation involves dramatic concerted structural rearrangements in which the zinc-binding domain plays a critical role. The combination of crystallographic and biochemical studies has allowed us to gain unprecedented insights into the activation events that lead to the catalytic turnover processes. This knowledge is central to understanding how interfacial activation is triggered in thermoalkalophilic lipases and paves the way for engineering lipases with biotechnological purposes.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning, Expression, and Purification of BTL2—The gene corresponding to the mature lipase from G. thermocatenulatus BTL2 was cloned into pT1 expression vector as previously described (18Schmidt-Dannert C. Rua M.L. Atomi H. Schmid R.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1301: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Cells carrying the recombinant plasmid pT1BTL2 were grown at 30 °C, and overexpression was induced by raising the temperature to 42 °C for 20 h. The enzyme was purified from Escherichia coli crude extract using a sequential chromatography step procedure in batch (octyl-Sepharose, PEI-agarose, and Q-Sepharose) as previously described (22Carrasco-López C. Godoy C. de las Rivas B. Fernández-Lorente G. Palomo J.M. Guisán J.M. Fernández-Lafuente R. Martínez-Ripoll M. Hermoso J.A. Acta Crystallogr F. 2008; 64: 1043-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In this purification procedure, a final washing step containing Triton X-100 (10 nm in distilled water) before enzyme elution from Q-Sepharose, permitted BTL2 activation for crystallization experiments.Immobilization of BTL2—BTL2 immobilization on cyanogen bromide-agarose (CNBr) was performed as previously described (20Palomo J.M. Ortiz C. Fuentes M. Fernandez-Lorente G. Guisan J.M. Fernandez-Lafuente R. J. Chromatogr A. 2004; 1038: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This preparation (prepared in the presence of detergent but later thoroughly washed with distilled water) permitted the immobilization of the monomeric form of the lipase, avoiding any intermolecular lipase-lipase interactions that could interfere with the properties of soluble lipases (21Fernandez-Lorente G. Godoy C.A. Mendes A.A. Lopez-Gallego F. Grazu V. de Las Rivas B. Palomo J.M. Hermoso J. Fernandez-Lafuente R. Guisan J.M.

Enzyme activity was checked at different times using the assay described above.Crystallization and Data Collection—Native crystals of BTL2 were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method as previously reported (22Carrasco-López C. Godoy C. de las Rivas B. Fernández-Lorente G. Palomo J.M. Guisán J.M. Fernández-Lafuente R. Martínez-Ripoll M. Hermoso J.A.

Good quality diffracting crystals, showing rice-grain shapes, were found in 0.05 m sodium citrate, pH 5.6, MPD (13%), and ammonium acetate (0.2 m). Native data sets were collected using synchrotron radiation source at the ESRF (Grenoble) on BM16 beamline using an ADSC Reverse PHI detector and a wavelength of 0.979234 Å. Collected images were processed and scaled using MOSFLM and SCALA programs, respectively from the CCP4 package (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). BTL2 crystals belong to the orthorhombic I222 space group (a = 73.07 Å, b = 129.08 Å, c = 127.49 Å.).Structure Determination and Refinement—The BTL2 structure was solved by the molecular replacement method using the MOLREP program from the CCP4 package with the P1 lipase structure from G. stearothermophilus (PDB code 1ji3) as the initial model. The model was subjected to successive refinement cycles with the CNS program (23Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar). Excellent density maps were obtained for the BTL2 structure except for the first two residues of the polypeptide chain. Two fragments of Triton X-100 used in the purification procedure were found in the catalytic groove of the BTL2 structure and three MPD molecules on the protein molecular surface involved in crystal packing interactions. Water molecules were gradually added with the waterpick routine of the CNS program.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONOverall Structure—The crystal structure of BTL2 has been solved at 2.2-Å resolution (structural determination parameters and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1). The three-dimensional structure of BTL2 (Fig. 1) comprises 389 residues and consists of an irregular (α/β) hydrolase fold formed by a central β-sheet of seven strands (β3-β9) surrounded by α-helices (α1 and α13 on one side and α2, α4, and α10 on the other side). An extra domain involved in Zn2+ coordination is present in this family of lipases consisting of helices α3 and α5 and strands b1 and b2, as previously described (9Jeong S.T. Kim H.K. Kim S.J. Chi S.W. Pan J.G. Oh T.K. Ryu S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17041-17047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). No significant variations are observed in the Zn2+ coordination in BTL2 versus B. stearothermophilus lipases (Lipases used in BTL2 structural analysis are summarized in Table 2). Zn2+ coordination bonds are formed with His-82 and His-88 (2.29 Å and 2.21 Å, respectively) from the extra domain, and Asp-62 (2.11 Å and 2.96 Å) and Asp-239 (2.13 Å and 2.71 Å) from the (α/β) hydrolase core domain. A Ca2+ ion is also found to form hydrogen bonds with regions comprised between b4 and α11, and β9 and α13 (Fig. 1). The coordination includes interactions with carboxyl oxygen atoms of Glu-361 (2.96 Å) and Asp-366 (2.89 Å), and with two main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms of Gly-287 (2.61 Å) and Pro-367 (2.58 Å). The BTL2 structure has been solved in the open (active) conformation with two Triton X-100 detergent molecules placed at the active site (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S2).TABLE 1BTL2 structure determination and refinement statisticsBTL2Data collection statisticsSpace groupI222Unit cell parameters a, Å73.07 b, Å129.08 c, Å127.49T (K)120Wavelength (Å)0.979234Resolution (Å)63.75 (2.36)-2.2Total no. of reflections285455No. of unique reflections37406Redundancy4.1 (4.5)aValues in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shellCompleteness (%)99.8 (100)I/σ8.9 (2.5)RmergebRsym = Σ| I – Iav|/ΣI, where the summation is over symmetry equivalent reflections0.14 (0.48)Refinement statisticsResolution range (Å)45.18–2.2Protein non-hydrogen atoms3056Ligand non-hydrogen atoms Detergent36 MPD24Water molecules534Metals ions2Rfactor (%)18.15RfreecRfree = value calculated for 7% of data excluded from the refinement (%)22.55R.m.s.d. bond length (Å)0.005R.m.s.d. bond angles (°)1.2Average B-factor (Å2)29.92a Values in parentheses correspond to the highest resolution shellb Rsym = Σ| I – Iav|/ΣI, where the summation is over symmetry equivalent reflectionsc Rfree = value calculated for 7% of data excluded from the refinement Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Lipase structures used in BTL2 structural analysisEnzyme (PDB code)SpeciesSequence identity (%)Lipase familyConformationLigandRef.BTL2 (2W22)G. thermocatenulatus-I.5.OpenTriton X-100L1 (1KU0)G. stearothermophilus95I.5.Closed-(9Jeong S.T.

The active site of BTL2 contains the catalytic triad residues (Ser-114, His-359, and Asp-318) located at their canonical positions in the α/β hydrolase fold (Fig. 2A). The catalytic serine is in the Ala-X-Ser-X-Gly motif characteristic of the thermoalkalophilic lipases (versus the Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly motif of most lipases and serine proteases) (25Kim H.K. Park S.Y. Lee J.K. Oh T.K. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The catalytic serine is exposed to solvent and substrate. In the closed state of L1 lipase, it has been observed that catalytic serine is in tight side-chain packing with some residues of the active site (His-113, Phe-17, Ile-320, Thr-270, and Met-326) resulting in the stabilization of the serine loop and contributing to the lipase thermostability (9Jeong S.T. Kim H.K. Kim S.J. Chi S.W. Pan J.G. Oh T.K. Ryu S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17041-17047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the BTL2 open structure, this tight packing is also maintained except for the Phe-17 (Fig. 2B). This residue changes its conformation allowing the access of the substrate to the catalytic Ser that changes its conformation, reorienting its Oγ group to the substrate. The movement of Phe-17 involves a change in its χ1 side-chain torsion angle (Δχ1 = 100°) from the closed to the open state. The conformer change of catalytic serine from the closed to the open forms also involves changes in the hydrogen-bonding pattern. In the closed state, the serine side chain Oγ atom points to His-113 Nδ1 atom (2.89 Å) and is 3.36 Å from the catalytic histidine N∊2 atom. However, in the active state, the serine side chain Oγ atom is 2.96 Å from the catalytic histidine N∊2 atom and 5.08 Å from the His-113 Nδ1 atom. No changes are observed in the hydrogen bonds between catalytic residues His-359 (Nδ1 atom) and Asp-318 (Oδ2 atom) in both closed and open states (2.68 Å and 2.81 Å, respectively) (Fig. 2B).The oxyanion produced in the tetrahedral intermediate is stabilized by interactions in the oxyanion hole, which in families I.1 and I.2 of bacterial lipases has been identified to be formed by the main chain amide groups of a couple of residues (Met-16 and His-83 in the I.1 family, and Leu-17 and Gln-88 in the I.2 family) (26Nardini M. Lang D.A. Liebeton K. Jaeger K.E. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31219-31225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The equivalent atoms in BTL2 are Phe-17 and Gln-115 that occupy virtually identical positions. The Phe-17 and Gln-115 backbone nitrogen atoms localize the oxyanion-binding pocket in a position that is very well conserved within the α/β hydrolase fold enzymes (27Ollis D.L. Cheah E. Cygler M. Dijkstra B. Frolow F. Franken S.M. Harel M. Remington S.J. Silman I. Schrag J. Sussman J.L. Verschueren K.H.G. Goldman A. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1830) Google Scholar, 28Nardini M. Dijkstra B.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 732-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 29Cygler M. Schrag J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 284: 3-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Phe-17 is the second residue of the tetrapeptide motif Gly-Hyd-X-Gly (Hyd = Phe, Leu, or Ile) located between strand β3 and helix α4 and is highly conserved in bacterial lipases from the I.5 family. No relevant differences are observed in the backbone of this region between the closed and open forms, and therefore it seems that formation of the oxyanion-binding pocket only requires the movement of the side chain of the Phe-17 residue.In families I.1 and I.2 of bacterial lipases, a totally buried Arg residue has been found connecting, via hydrogen bonds, the oxyanion hole tetrapeptide motif to the loop between strand β3 and helix α2 (26Nardini M. Lang D.A. Liebeton K. Jaeger K.E. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31219-31225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The variation of the hydrogen-bonding pattern of this Arg between the closed and open forms of I.1 and I.2 lipases has been predicted to play an important stabilizing role during the opening of the lid of these lipases (26Nardini M. Lang D.A. Liebeton K. Jaeger K.E. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31219-31225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). An Arg residue is also found in the equivalent positions of BTL2 (Arg-63) connecting His-15 (through a hydrogen bond between its carbonyl oxygen atom and the Arg-63 NH2 atom) to Gly-55 (through a hydrogen bond between its carbonyl oxygen atom and the Arg-63 NH1 atom) (Fig. 2B). A comparison with the closed form of the L1 lipase reveals that there is no variation in the hydrogen-bonding pattern of this Arg residue in agreement with the preformed oxyanion hole found in BTL2. Interestingly, Arg-63 is placed just after Asp-62, which is directly involved in Zn2+ coordination. Therefore, in the I.5 family of bacterial lipases, the Arg-63 might play a stabilizing role in the oxyanion-binding pocket, a role that should be reinforced by the Zn2+-binding domain, which is characteristic of this family of lipases.The Active Site Cleft and Binding Interactions with the Substrate—Two molecules of Triton detergent have been identified occupying the hydrophobic active site cleft (Fig. 2A). This cleft is 14-Å deep and has an ovoid shape with approximate dimensions of 18 × 25 Å, with an area of 847.9 Å2 and a volume of 1183.1 Å3 (as calculated by CASTp). Its walls are lined mostly with hydrophobic/aromatic side chains (Ala-241, Ile-320, Ile-363, Leu-171, Leu-184, Leu-189, Leu-209, Leu-245, Leu-360, Leu-57, Met-174, Phe-17, Phe-182, Phe-291, Pro-165, Tyr-30, Val-172, Val-175, Val-188, Val-234, Val-295, Val-321, and Val-365) to achieve a perfect stabilization of the lipid substrate. At the base of the cleft, the Phe-17 side chain divides it in two parts, thus giving a boomerang-like shape to the active site as also described for other lipases (Fig. 2A), with four binding pockets, an oxyanion hole, and three pockets for the different branches of the triacylglycerol substrate.The Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipase (PAL) belonging to the I.1 family of bacterial lipases has been crystallized in complex with a triglyceride-like inhibitor (26Nardini M. Lang D.A. Liebeton K. Jaeger K.E. Dijkstra B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31219-31225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) (Table 2). The complex has demonstrated, for the I.1 family, the position of the oxyanion hole and of the three pockets that accommodate the sn-1, sn-2, and sn-3 fatty acid chains. Despite the structural differences between PAL and BTL2, superimposition of the (α/β) hydrolase core of both enzymes yields a well fitted triglyceride analog into the active site cleft of the BTL2 lipase (Fig. 3A). Remarkably, superimposition reveals that Triton X-100 moieties found in the BTL2 structure are coincident with two acyl chains (sn-1 and sn-3) of the triacylglycerol substrate in PAL. Therefore, structural analysis of PAL and BTL2 offers the opportunity of direct identification of the three acyl-binding pockets of the triglyceride substrate in the I.5 family of bacterial lipases. The Triton X-100 molecule TRT1 found in BTL2 is accommodated in a large groove formed by the side chains of Phe-17, Leu-184, Val-188, Leu-189, Leu-57, Leu-209, Leu-214, and Trp-212 (Fig. 3). The long aliphatic chain of 20 atoms of the detergent perfectly fits in this cleft and is bound via van der Waals interactions. This cavity in PAL corresponds to the acyl chain pocket A (HA). As in the PAL structure, the alcohol-binding pocket is separated from the acyl pocket by the side chain of Phe-17 (Met-16 in PAL); however the acyl pocket groove is larger in BTL2 (about 9.0 Å × 22 Å) than in PAL (about 8.5 Å × 9.0 Å) pointing to longer chain substrates in the I.5 family than in the I.1 family of bacterial lipases.FIGURE 3Putative binding of a triacylglycerol molecule to I.5 lipases. A, stereo view of the surface representation of the substrate binding site of BTL2. The two detergent moieties (TRT1 and TRT2) are represented as white sticks. The structure of the triglyceride-like inhibitor (blue sticks) of the P. aeruginosa lipase complex (PDB code 1EX9) is represented as a direct superimposition of the (α/β) hydrolase core of both enzymes.

The latter residues are part of the calcium-binding loop (residues 358–367). The HH pocket is similar in PAL than in BTL2, and there is space for about 8–10 fatty acid carbon atoms. The acyl chain-binding pocket, the sn-1 moiety of the triglyceride analog (HB pocket) in PAL, corresponds in BTL2 to a hydrophobic pocket lined by Ile-320, Val-321, Leu-171, Val-175, Leu-184, Met-174, Phe-291, and Val-295 (Fig. 3). The hydrophobic nature of the HB pocket is similar in both BTL2 and PAL lipases; however in BTL2 the HB pocket tightly interacts with the TRT2 Triton X-100 molecule, while in PAL this pocket is more exposed to the solvent. The three pockets (HA, HH, and HB) identified in BTL2 should also be present in the rest of the members of the I.5 family of bacterial lipases considering their high degree of sequence similarity.Activation Mechanism—The existence of an adjustable loop at only one end of the α6-helix and the bipartite distribution of hydrophobic resides in that α6-helix, with bulky side chains at the N-terminal-half and short side chain residues at the C-terminal-half, led to the proposed model of a unidirectional opening mechanism of the lid (9Jeong S.T.

https://openalex.org/W2082467091,"Selenoproteins contain a highly reactive 21st amino acid selenocysteine (Sec) encoded by recoding of a predefined UGA codon. Because of a lack of selenoprotein supply, high chemical reactivity of Sec, and intricate translation machineries, selenoprotein crystal structures are difficult to obtain. Structural prerequisites for Sec involvement in enzyme catalysis are therefore sparsely known. Here we present the crystal structure of catalytically active rat thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1), revealing surprises at the C-terminal Sec-containing active site in view of previous literature. The oxidized enzyme presents a selenenylsulfide motif in trans-configuration, with the selenium atom of Sec-498 positioned beneath the side chain of Tyr-116, thereby located far from the redox active moieties proposed to be involved in electron transport to the Sec-containing active site. Upon reduction to a selenolthiol motif, the Sec residue moved toward solvent exposure, consistent with its presumed role in reduction of TrxR1 substrates or as target of electrophilic agents inhibiting the enzyme. A Y116I mutation lowered catalytic efficiency in reduction of thioredoxin, but surprisingly increased turnover using 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (juglone) as substrate. The same mutation also decreased sensitivity to inhibition by cisplatin. The results suggest that Tyr-116 plays an important role for catalysis of TrxR1 by interacting with the selenenylsulfide of oxidized TrxR1, thereby facilitating its reduction in the reductive half-reaction of the enzyme. The interaction of a selenenylsulfide with the phenyl ring of a tyrosine, affecting turnover, switch of substrate specificity, and modulation of sensitivity to electrophilic agents, gives important clues into the mechanism of TrxR1, which is a selenoprotein that plays a major role for mammalian cell fate and function. The results also demonstrate that a recombinant selenoprotein TrxR can be produced in high amount and sufficient purity to enable crystal structure determination, which suggests that additional structural studies of these types of proteins are feasible.

Selenoproteins contain the 21st amino acid selenocysteine (Sec), an analogue of cysteine (Cys), where selenium takes the place of sulfur. This sulfur-for-selenium substitution makes Sec a highly reactive nucleophile having a lower pKa value than Cys. The free selenolate of Sec can easily oxidize to form either selenenic or seleninic acid or, alternatively, a diselenide or selenenylsulfide with another Sec or Cys residue, respectively. Compounds, peptides, or proteins with diselenide or selenenylsulfide bonds typically display drastically lower redox potentials than the corresponding disulfide variants (3Stadtman T.C. Annu. Rev.

The redox features and chemical properties of Sec are accordingly functionally utilized in selenoproteins, often being oxidoreductases with a single catalytic Sec residue in their active sites. The structural basis for the use of Sec in selenoproteins is difficult to study because of limited availability of pure enzyme. Most selenoproteins are cumbersome to purify because of their low natural abundance and the high chemical reactivity of Sec that easily compromises the amino acid, and because of difficulties in production of synthetic selenoproteins. Barriers for straightforward recombinant production derive from the fact that Sec is co-translationally inserted at the position of a predefined UGA codon (normally a stop codon) by intricate translation machineries (13Tormay P. Böck A. J. Bacteriol.. 1997; 179: 576-582Google Scholar). Selenoprotein translation involves several special components, including a Sec-dedicated tRNA and a Sec-specific elongation factor. These interact with species- or domain-specific secondary structures in the selenoprotein mRNA, thereby identifying the UGA codon as Sec-encoding and not as a translational termination codon (10Johansson L.

Both these structures presented a Sec residue oxidized to seleninic acid thereby representing an inactive hyperoxidized form of the enzyme, which may possibly be produced during catalysis as a dead-end oxidation product (18Epp O.

Chem.. 1977; 252: 4600-4606Google Scholar) or rat (24Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry.. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Google Scholar) tissues, with the human enzyme subsequently discovered to be a selenoprotein with its Sec residue located at the penultimate C-terminal position (25Gladyshev V.N. Jeang K.-T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1996; 93: 6146-6151Google Scholar, 26Tamura T. Stadtman T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1996; 93: 1006-1011Google Scholar). Soon it became clear that the C-terminal -Gly-Cys-Sec-Gly-COOH motif of the human selenoprotein was found in all mammalian TrxRs, and based upon the results of extensive enzymatic and biochemical analyses, the Cys-Sec dyad of this motif was shown to form a reversible selenenylsulfide/selenolthiol constituting the proper active site of the enzyme (27Arscott L.D.

Therefore, it is clearly different in structure and function from the smaller form of thioredoxin reductases found in lower organisms. In 2001, the first crystal structure of a Sec-to-Cys mutant of rat TrxR1 was published (32Sandalova T. Zhong L. Lindqvist Y. Holmgren A. Schneider G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med.. 2006; 41: 649-656Google Scholar) have generated a generally accepted model for the major features of the catalytic mechanism of mammalian TrxRs. This model is summarized in Fig. 1. Shortly, it involves a head-to-tail arrangement of the two subunits in homodimeric FAD-containing TrxR1, displaying an overall structure and the first part of the reductive half-reaction closely similar to that of glutathione reductase. Fully oxidized enzyme (EHox, enzyme species 1 in Fig. 1) is first reduced by 1 eq of NADPH to the two-electron-reduced enzyme (EH2) involving reduced FADH2 (species 2), making a charge-transfer complex with the second Cys in an N-terminal -CVNVGC- motif (species 3). The charge-transfer complex has a unique absorbance spectrum and is a feature shared with several enzymes of the pyridine nucleotide disulfide oxidoreductases, including glutathione reductase (27Arscott L.D. Gromer S. Schirmer R.H. Becker K. Williams Jr., C.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1997; 94: 3621-3626Google Scholar, 44Williams Jr., C.H. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. 3. CRC Press, Inc, Boca-Raton, FL1992: 121-211Google Scholar). The corresponding motif of glutathione reductase is the proper active site of that enzyme, catalyzing reduction of glutathione disulfide. In mammalian TrxRs, however, this motif is instead believed to transfer electrons further to a C-terminal selenenylsulfide of the other subunit in the dimer, which thereby is considered to mimic the glutathione disulfide substrate of glutathione reductase, forming a selenolthiol upon its reduction (species 4). The actual state of TrxR reducing its principal substrate thioredoxin is believed to be the four-electron reduced EH4 enzyme, made by reduction of EH2 with a second equivalent of NADPH and having a thiolate-FAD charge-transfer complex concomitant with a selenolthiol at the C terminus (species 6). Upon reduction of thioredoxin, EH2 (species 3) is again formed. This mechanism postulates a reversible formation of the selenenylsulfide/selenolthiol motif at the C terminus and its direct interaction with the N-terminal thiolate-FAD charge-transfer complex. However, no structure has yet been determined for any Sec-containing TrxR that could confirm this assumption. The structure of the selenenylsulfide motif and its location in the enzyme has so far only been modeled. The prior structure determinations of Sec-to-Cys mutant forms of mammalian TrxR (32Sandalova T. Zhong L. Lindqvist Y. Holmgren A. Schneider G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2001; 98: 9533-9538Google Scholar, 36Biterova E.I. Turanov A.A. Gladyshev V.N. Barycki J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2005; 102: 15018-15023Google Scholar, 37Fritz-Wolf K. Urig S. Becker K. J. Mol. Biol.. 2007; 370: 116-127Google Scholar) furthermore revealed that the C-terminal tail seems to be highly flexible, with the configuration of the final C-terminal residues therefore difficult to model with any appreciable certainty. Here we were able to determine the crystal structure of recombinantly produced Sec-containing rat TrxR1, and we could thereby assess a number of previous assumptions regarding the features of the C-terminal redox active motif. The results indeed confirm that a selenenylsulfide is formed at the C-terminal end of the oxidized enzyme. Unexpectedly, this motif was located far away from the corresponding site of the disulfide in oxidized glutathione in complex with glutathione reductase, where it has previously been modeled. Furthermore, the selenenylsulfide of TrxR1 presents a unique interaction with the phenyl ring of a tyrosine side chain in the active site (Tyr-116). Mutation of Tyr-116 resulted in lowered catalytic efficiency and thus confirmed its importance, but surprisingly, its mutation could also alter the substrate specificity of the enzyme, showing increased turnover with juglone as substrate with a Y116I (but not Y116T) mutation. The Tyr-116 mutation also conferred increased resistance to cisplatin, believed to target the Sec residue in the selenolthiol motif. Upon reduction of the C-terminal motif to a selenolthiol, the Sec side chain was indeed found relocated to a solvent-exposed position, consistent with its proposed major role in reduction of substrates for the enzyme. These results give insights into the structural basis for the function of Sec in TrxR1 and also raise questions regarding the mechanism of selenenylsulfide reduction during the reductive half-reaction of the enzyme. Materials and Chemicals—If not specified, all chemicals were of high purity and were obtained from Sigma, and the sources for rare materials are mentioned in the text. Phenylarsine oxide-Sepharose was synthesized as described (45Cheng Q. Stone-Elander S. Arnér E.S.J. Nat. Protocols.. 2006; 1: 604-613Google Scholar). TE buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) was used during the entire study if not stated otherwise. Expression and Purification of TrxR1—Rat TrxR1 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified over 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) as described previously, resulting in a mixture of selenium-containing and UGA-truncated enzyme (46Rengby O. Johansson L. Carlson L.A. Serini E. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Kårsnäs P. Arnér E.S.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol.. 2004; 70: 5159-5167Google Scholar). To get enriched selenium-containing enzyme, one more affinity chromatography using phenylarsine oxide-Sepharose was performed as described (45Cheng Q. Stone-Elander S. Arnér E.S.J. Nat. Protocols.. 2006; 1: 604-613Google Scholar, 47Johansson L. Chen C. Thorell J.-O. Fredriksson A. Stone-Elander S. Gafvelin G. Arnér E.S.J. Nat. Meth.. 2004; 1: 61-66Google Scholar). Shortly, the purified recombinant TrxR1 with about 15-25 units/mg specific activity in the standard DTNB assay (48Arnér E.S.J. Holmgren A. Maines M. Costa L. Reed D. Sassa S. Current Protocols in Toxicology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc, New York2000: 7.4.1-7.4.14Google Scholar) was reduced by 2 mm dithiothreitol for 20 min and then subjected to phenylarsine oxide-Sepharose pre-equilibrated with TE buffer. The column was then extensively washed with TE buffer containing 5 mm dithiothreitol to remove truncated protein. Subsequently enriched Sec-containing enzyme (specific activity at least 40 units/mg) was eluted using TE buffer with 10 mm sodium 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonate. The purity of the enzyme was confirmed by both SDS-PAGE and high pressure liquid chromatography using Superdex Gel Filtration Column 200 10/300 GL on anÄKTAExplorer 10 system (GE Healthcare). The pure enzyme was subsequently desalted with NAP-25 column (GE Healthcare), concentrated over a 30-kDa cutoff ultracentrifuge device (PALL), and stored in TE buffer at 4 °C. Construction of TrxR1 Tyrosine 116 Mutants—Two Tyr-116 TrxR1 mutants, with Tyr-116 changed to either isoleucine (Y116I) or threonine (Y116T), were produced. The cDNAs containing the corresponding mutations and the bacterial type SECIS element for Sec insertion (45Cheng Q. Stone-Elander S. Arnér E.S.J. Nat. Protocols.. 2006; 1: 604-613Google Scholar, 49Arnér E.S.J. Sarioglu H. Lottspeich F. Holmgren A. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol.. 1999; 292: 1003-1016Google Scholar) were prepared using overlap extension PCR as described (50Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.).. 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar) (detailed PCR protocol and primer sequences are given in the supplemental material). After ligation of the fragments into the pET41a vector (Novagen) between the NdeI and EcoRI cloning sites, the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (MWG Biotec). The plasmids were then transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) followed by a co-transformation of the pSUABC plasmid (49Arnér E.S.J. Sarioglu H. Lottspeich F. Holmgren A. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol.. 1999; 292: 1003-1016Google Scholar), with expression and purification of full-length selenium-containing forms performed as for the wild type TrxR1 described above. We also attempted to make a Tyr-116 to phenylalanine variant but failed because of formation of nonsoluble protein and inclusion bodies that could not be recovered. Crystallization—Purified recombinant rat TrxR1 with the same or slightly better enzymatic activity as found with purified native enzyme (at least 40 units/mg in the standard DTNB assay) was concentrated to 16 mg/ml in the presence of 10 mm NADP+. Crystals were grown by the vapor diffusion method, and the crystals used for data collections were obtained after 2-3 days in 15% polyethylene glycol 3350, 12% ethylene glycol, and 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, in the hanging drop (1.5 μl protein + 1.5 μl reservoir). Data Collection and Processing—Freezing of the crystals of TrxR1 did not require cryoprotection because of the presence of polyethylene glycol 3350 and ethylene glycol in the crystallization solution. The data were collected at tunable beamline I911-3 (MAX Lab, Lund, Sweden). X-ray absorption spectroscopy showed a clear signal for selenium, and the data sets were collected at the peak of selenium absorption (λ = 0.978 Å). Data sets from two different crystals of TrxR1 were obtained using different times for data collection. The 2.75-Å data set was collected with 25 s per image and Δφ = 0.8°, with 225 images used for the data set. The 3.1-Å data set was collected with 10 s and 1.2° per image. All diffraction data were processed with the program MOSFLM (51Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography.1992Google Scholar), scaled, and merged with SCALA from the CCP4 suite of programs (52Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 1994; 50 (4): 760-763Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The cell dimensions of TrxR1 differed about 2 Å from the mutant protein (32Sandalova T. Zhong L. Lindqvist Y. Holmgren A. Schneider G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2001; 98: 9533-9538Google Scholar), and we therefore used molecular replacement with the MOL-REP program (53Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Google Scholar) to find the location of the protein in the cell. The estimation of the solvent content in the crystals of TrxR1 suggested that the asymmetric unit contained three dimers. A dimer of Sec-498 to Cys mutant TrxR1, PDB code 1h6v (32Sandalova T. Zhong L. Lindqvist Y. Holmgren A. Schneider G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2001; 98: 9533-9538Google Scholar), omitting the last five residues was used as a search model. The best solution had an R-factor of 0.43. Ten cycles of rigid body refinement of the individual subunits using REFMAC5 and data in the 50-2.75-Å resolution interval (54Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar) resulted in a decrease of Rfree by 5%. Tight noncrystallographic symmetry restraints for all atoms were used in the refinement except for Trp-114, which obviously had different and multiple conformations in the subunits, and for the last six residues for which medium restraints were applied. Adjustments of the model was performed with COOT (55Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr.. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Google Scholar). Restrained refinement converged with R/Rfree 27.5/30.1%. TLS refinement with each subunit treated as a TLS group resulted in a large drop of the R-factors (R/Rfree 20.6/23.6) without appreciable changes in the quality of the electron density map. The second data set, collected as quickly as possible to avoid reduction of the enzyme by the intense x-ray radiation, gave usable data to only 3.1 Å and was refined as above but starting from the first model obtained. Refinements and model statistics for both data sets are summarized in Table 1. Figs. 2, 3, 4 were made with PyMOL (56DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System. DeLano Scientific, Palo Alto, CA2002Google Scholar). The crystallographic data have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank, accession codes 3EAO (TrxR1 with oxidized C terminus) and 3EAN (TrxR1 with reduced C terminus).FIGURE 3Models based upon the TrxR1 structure. A, this model displays two molecules of Trx1 (red), the principal substrate of TrxR1, docked to the two active sites formed between the subunits (green and yellow) of dimeric TrxR1. The structure of TrxR1 with a reduced C-terminal motif was used for this model, also proposing the conformation of a mixed selenenylsulfide between Cys-32 of Trx and Sec-498 of TrxR1 (shown in detail in B). C, model of the oxidized C-terminal motif as found in the structure is shown, where it has been positioned closer to the N-terminal redox active motif.

https://openalex.org/W2113842515,"Imprinted genes display differential allelic expression in a manner that depends on the sex of the transmitting parent. The degree of imprinting is often tissue-specific and/or developmental stage-specific, and may be altered in some diseases including cancer. Here we applied Illumina/Solexa sequencing of the transcriptomes of reciprocal F1 mouse neonatal brains and identified 26 genes with parent-of-origin dependent differential allelic expression. Allele-specific Pyrosequencing verified 17 of them, including three novel imprinted genes. The known and novel imprinted genes all are found in proximity to previously reported differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Ten genes known to be imprinted in placenta had sufficient expression levels to attain a read depth that provided statistical power to detect imprinting, and yet all were consistent with non-imprinting in our transcript count data for neonatal brain. Three closely linked and reciprocally imprinted gene pairs were also discovered, and their pattern of expression suggests transcriptional interference. Despite the coverage of more than 5000 genes, this scan only identified three novel imprinted refseq genes in neonatal brain, suggesting that this tissue is nearly exhaustively characterized. This approach has the potential to yield an complete catalog of imprinted genes after application to multiple tissues and developmental stages, shedding light on the mechanism, bioinformatic prediction, and evolution of imprinted genes and diseases associated with genomic imprinting."
https://openalex.org/W2034090560,"Background A laboratory inbred strain of the annual fish Nothobranchius furzeri shows exceptionally short life expectancy and accelerated expression of age markers. In this study, we analyze new wild-derived lines of this short-lived species. Methodology/Principal Findings We characterized captive survival and age-related traits in F1 and F2 offspring of wild-caught N. furzeri. Wild-derived N. furzeri lines showed expression of lipofuscin and neurodegeneration at age 21 weeks. Median lifespan in the laboratory varied from to 20 to 23 weeks and maximum lifespan from 25 to 32 weeks. These data demonstrate that rapid age-dependent decline and short lifespan are natural characteristics of this species. The N. furzeri distribution range overlaps with gradients in altitude and aridity. Fish from more arid habitats are expected to experience a shorter survival window in the wild. We tested whether captive lines stemming from semi-arid and sub-humid habitats differ in longevity and expression of age-related traits. We detected a clear difference in age-dependent cognitive decline and a slight difference in lifespan (16% for median, 15% for maximum lifespan) between these lines. Finally, we observed shorter lifespan and accelerated expression of age-related markers in the inbred laboratory strain compared to these wild-derived lines. Conclusions/Significance Owing to large differences in aging phenotypes in different lines, N. furzeri could represent a model system for studying the genetic control of life-history traits in natural populations."
https://openalex.org/W2003859810,"Electron transfer pathways associated to oxygenic photosynthesis, including cyclic electron flow around photosystem I and chlororespiration, rely on non-photochemical reduction of plastoquinones (PQs). In higher plant chloroplasts, a bacterial-like NDH complex homologous to complex I is involved in PQ reduction, but such a complex is absent from Chlamydomonas plastids where a type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenase activity has been proposed to operate. With the aim to elucidate the nature of the enzyme-supporting non-photochemical reduction of PQs, one of the type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenases identified in the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome (Nda2) was produced as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli and further characterized. As many type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenases, Nda2 uses NADH as a preferential substrate, but in contrast to the eukaryotic enzymes described so far, contains non-covalently bound FMN as a cofactor. When expressed at a low level, Nda2 complements growth of an E. coli lacking both NDH-1 and NDH-2, but is toxic at high expression levels. Using an antibody raised against the recombinant protein and based on its mass spectrometric identification, we show that Nda2 is localized in thylakoid membranes. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements performed on thylakoid membranes show that Nda2 is able to interact with thylakoid membranes of C. reinhardtii by reducing PQs from exogenous NADH or NADPH. We discuss the possible involvement of Nda2 in cyclic electron flow around PSI, chlororespiration, and hydrogen production.

Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements performed on thylakoid membranes show that Nda2 is able to interact with thylakoid membranes of C. reinhardtii by reducing PQs from exogenous NADH or NADPH. We discuss the possible involvement of Nda2 in cyclic electron flow around PSI, chlororespiration, and hydrogen production. Higher plant thylakoid membranes contain a multisubunit Ndh complex resembling bacterial complex I, which mediates plastoquinone (PQ) 3The abbreviations used are: PQ, plastoquinone; WT, wild type; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PSI, Photosystem I. 3The abbreviations used are: PQ, plastoquinone; WT, wild type; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; PSI, Photosystem I. reduction from stromal pyridine nucleotide (NADH or NADPH) electron donors and therefore participates in the establishment of cyclic electron transfer around Photosystem I (PSI) and chlororespiration (1Burrows P.A. Sazanov L.A. Svab Z. Maliga P. Nixon P.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 2Peltier G. Cournac L. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 523-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 3Rumeau D. Peltier G. Cournac L. Plant Cell Environ. 2007; 30: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Although significant activity of non-photochemical PQ reduction was reported in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii thylakoids (4Godde D. Trebst A. Arch. Microbiol. 1980; 127: 245-252Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 5Mus F. Cournac L. Cardettini V. Caruana A. Peltier G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 322-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), it is generally considered that a type I Ndh complex is absent from algal chloroplasts (2Peltier G. Cournac L. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 523-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Indeed, most microalgal species, such as C. reinhardtii, and some gymnosperms species, such as Pinus thunbergii, do not harbor plastid ndh genes encoding hydrophobic subunits of the type I Ndh complex and, at least in the case of C. reinhardtii, the corresponding genes are absent from the nuclear genome, therefore, questioning the nature of the enzyme involved in non-photochemical reduction of PQs (2Peltier G. Cournac L. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 523-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 5Mus F. Cournac L. Cardettini V. Caruana A. Peltier G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 322-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Non-photochemical reduction of PQs is involved in several processes, which have been rather well-documented in C. reinhardtii, including chlororespiration (2Peltier G. Cournac L. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2002; 53: 523-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 6Bennoun P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 4352-4356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cyclic electron flow around PSI (7Ravenel J. Peltier G. Havaux M. Planta. 1994; 193: 251-259Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and state transition (8Gans P. Rebeillé F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1015: 150-155Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 9Depége N. Bellafiore S. Rochaix J.D. Science. 2003; 299: 1572-1575Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). More recently, non-photochemical reduction of PQs has also been involved in the ability of algae to sustain hydrogen production during the anaerobic phase of starch to hydrogen conversion (10Cournac L. Mus F. Bernard L. Guedeney G. Vignais P. Peltier G. Int. J. Hydrogen Energy. 2002; 27: 1229-1237Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 11Melis A. Planta. 2007; 226: 1075-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), this reaction considered as a limiting step of the process (10Cournac L. Mus F. Bernard L. Guedeney G. Vignais P. Peltier G. Int. J. Hydrogen Energy. 2002; 27: 1229-1237Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In this context, unraveling the nature of the enzymes involved in non-photochemical reduction of PQs in C. reinhardtii, appears as an important goal toward elucidating chlororespiration, cyclic electron transfer pathways operating around PSI, as well as mechanisms of hydrogen production. Based on pharmacological and physiological studies, we previously proposed that a NDH-2 type enzyme might be responsible for this activity in C. reinhardtii thylakoids (5Mus F. Cournac L. Cardettini V. Caruana A. Peltier G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1708: 322-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Type II NAD(P)H-dehydrogenases are monomeric enzymes that contain a flavin cofactor and, unlike type I NAD(P)H dehydrogenases (complex I), are non-proton pumping enzymes. Numerous sequences encoding putative NDH-2 have been found in various organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, and plants (12Melo A.M. Bandeiras T.M. Teixeira M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 13Rasmusson A.G. Svensson A.S. Knoop V. Grohmann L. Brennicke A. Plant J. 1999; 20: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Michalecka A.M. Agius S.C. Moller I.M. Rasmusson A.G. Plant J. 2004; 37: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The Arabidopsis thaliana genome contains three gene families, in total seven reading frames, encoding NDH-2 homologs (15Michalecka A.M. Svensson A.S. Johansson F.I. Agius S.C. Johanson U. Brennicke A. Binder S. Rasmusson A.G. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 642-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Based on GFP localization studies and in vitro protein import assays, six of these putative A. thaliana NDH-2 were located in mitochondria (15Michalecka A.M. Svensson A.S. Johansson F.I. Agius S.C. Johanson U. Brennicke A. Binder S. Rasmusson A.G. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 642-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 16Elhafez D. Murcha M.W. Clifton R. Soole K.L. Day D.A. Whelan J. Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In silico screening revealed the presence of several putative NDH-2 in the C. reinhardtii genome (17Cardol P. Gonzalez-Halphen D. Reyes-Prieto A. Baurain D. Matagne R.F. Remacle C. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 447-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). One of them (Nda2) was produced as a recombinant protein and further characterized. Using antibodies directed against the recombinant protein, we show that Nda2 is located in chloroplasts. Based on chlorophyll fluorescence measurements, we show that Nda2 reduces plastoquinones using NADH or NADPH as substrates. The function of Nda2 is discussed in relation to its possible involvement in chlororespiration, cyclic electron transfer reactions, and H2 photoproduction. Algal and Bacterial Strains and Chemicals—C. reinhardtii cells were grown on a Tris-acetate-phosphate medium (TAP) (18Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. A Comprehensive Guide to Biology and Laboratory Use. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1989Google Scholar). Algal cultures were grown at 25 °C under continuous agitation and low (1 μmol of photons·m–2·s–1) or medium (about 60 μmol of photons·m–2·s–1) light intensity. The wild-type (WT) strain used in this work was isolated as a mt+ segregant of a cross between two strains, which are isogenic to the 137c strain. The C. reinhardtii cell wall-deficient mutant strain CW15 was used for the preparation of chloroplast- and mitochondria-enriched fractions. Cloning and production of recombinant Nda2 were performed in the Escherichia coli dH10ß strain. The E. coli mutant lacking both NDH-1 and NDH-2 (ANN0222) was generously provided by Prof. Thorsten Friedrich (University of Freiburg, Germany); this mutant was obtained using the AN387 strain as background. Unless specified, E. coli strains were grown on a LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 0.5% NaCl, pH 7). In some experiments, the E. coli strains ANN0222 and AN387 were grown on a minimal M9 medium (2 mm MgSO4, 10 mm CaCl2, 47 mm Na2HPO4, 22 mm KH2PO4, 8.5 mm NaCl, 18 mm NH4Cl, pH 7.2) supplemented with 0.4% mannitol. Unless mentioned otherwise, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Cloning of NDA2—Total RNA was isolated from TAP cultures of WT C. reinhardtii (106 to 107 cells·ml–1) with the RNeasy® Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the Omniscript™ Reverse Transcriptase system (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). cDNAs were amplified by PCR with Turbo Pfu polymerase enzyme (Stratagene, Amsterdam, NL) using the following primers: (F) 5′-ATGAGCCTTGATGGCCAAAAC-3′ and (R) 5′-TCACACTCGCGAGATGTCGCG-3′ (supplemental Fig. S1). EcoRI and SmaI sites (in italics below) were, respectively, inserted upstream and downstream of the start and the stop codons, and a (His)6-tag coding sequence (underlined) was inserted right upstream of the start codon. For this purpose, the following oligonucleotides were used: 5′-CGGAATTCATGCATCATCATCATCATCATAGCCTTGATGGCCAAAAC-3′; and 5′-TCCCCCGGGTCACACTCGCGAGATGTCGCG-3′. The amplified fragment was digested by EcoRI and SmaI, and ligated into a digested pSD80 plasmid (19Patel A.M. Dunn S.D. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3917-3922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resultant plasmid (pSD80-NDA2) was sequenced and further used to transform E. coli (strain DH10β) by electroporation. Transformed strains resistant to 100μg·ml–1 ampicillin were screened by PCR by using (F) and (R) primers. Colony-forming Assays—AN387 and ANN0222 E. coli-competent cells were chemically transformed with the pSD80-NDA2 plasmid and transformants were selected on LB agar containing ampicillin (100 μg·ml–1). Transformation with an empty pSD80 vector was performed as a control. Transformants were grown to mid-exponential phase at 37 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (100 μg·ml–1). Cells were washed once with sterile M9 medium and serially diluted in the M9 medium supplemented with 0.4% mannitol as the sole source of carbon. Diluted cells suspensions were then spotted on agar plates containing 0.4% mannitol, 100 μg·l–1 ampicillin and 0.1 mm IPTG and further incubated at 37 °C for 2 days. As a control, diluted cell suspensions were spotted on LB agar plates containing 100 μg·l–1 ampicillin and 0.1 mm IPTG and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Phylogenetic Analysis—Six C. reinhardtii putative NDH-2 (called NDAX) amino acid sequences were aligned using ClustalW 2.0.9 software (20Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R.

Next, the resulting alignment was manually refined using SeaView (21Galtier N. Gouy M. Gautier C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 543-548PubMed Google Scholar) and regions where homology was doubtful were removed from further analysis. A total of 305 amino acid positions were kept for the phylogenetic analysis (Additional file 2). Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using Neighbor-Joining (NJ), Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Parsimony (Pars) approaches in the Phylogenetic Inference Package PHYLIP version 3.67 (22Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar). The PROTML program was used for ML analysis and the sequence input order was randomized (20 jumbles). The PROTDIST program was used to create distance matrices. The SEQ-BOOT and CONSENSE programs were used for bootstrap value calculations on 100 replications and consensus tree reconstructions, respectively. To examine the confidence of nodes, Neighbor-Joining and Parsimony analysis were done using the NEIGHBOR and protpars programs. The phylogenetic tree was drawn with MEGA4 (23Tamura K. Dudley J. Nei M. Kumar S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (25511) Google Scholar). Production and Purification of His-tagged Nda2—Bacterial cells expressing His-tagged Nda2 were grown at 37 °C in a LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg·ml–1) to an absorbance of 0.5 measured at 600 nm. After induction by 100 μm IPTG and overnight culture at room temperature, bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed using a French press (16,000 p.s.i.) in buffer A (25 mm imidazole pH 7.5, 20 mm amine-triethanol, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine). The supernatant was recovered by centrifugation (12,000 × g for 20 min) and used for further purification of His-tagged Nda2 by metal-chelating chromatography as previously described (24Vieira Dos Santos C. Cuiné S. Rouhier N. Rey P. Plant Physiol. 2005; 138: 909-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). After addition of glycerol (50% v/v), the purified enzyme was stored at –20 °C. A rabbit serum was raised against the purified Nda2 protein (Agro-Bio, Villeny, France). The nature of the flavin cofactor of Nda2 was determined by HPLC as described by Ref. 25Bernard L. Desplats C. Mus F. Cuiné S. Cournac L. Peltier G. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3625-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar after protein denaturation using 10% trichloroacetic acid, FAD, and FMN standards were used as controls and subjected to the same extraction procedure. Chromatographic mobility and absorption spectra of standards were not affected by the extraction procedure, showing that no conversion of FAD into FMN occurred during the experiment. Activity Measurements—Assays of NADH or NADPH oxidation were performed by monitoring absorbance decay at 340 nm. NADH or NADPH, electron acceptors, and protein extracts were added successively. Bovine SOD (500 units·ml–1) and catalase (1000 units·ml–1) were added to the assay medium. Measurements of O2 uptake by E. coli membranes in the presence of NAD(P)H and measurements of NAD(P)H-triggered chlorophyll fluorescence rise in thylakoid preparations from C. reinhardtii were performed according to Ref. 25Bernard L. Desplats C. Mus F. Cuiné S. Cournac L. Peltier G. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3625-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar. Protein Separation and Immunoblot Analysis—C. reinhardtii or E. coli protein extracts were loaded on 10% SDS/PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry transfer technique when not specified otherwise. A commercial antibody directed against the His tag sequence (Sigma Ref. H-1029) was used to identify the purified protein on 13% SDS/PAGE gels. The Nda2 antiserum was diluted to 1:10,000 and Alexa 680 goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes) was used as a secondary antibody. Immunoblots were scanned by using a LICOR Odyssey system (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Preparation of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria—C. reinhardtii chloroplasts and mitochondria were prepared according to Ref. 26Atteia A. van Lis R. Gelius-Dietrich G. Adrait A. Garin J. Joyard J. Rolland N. Martin W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9909-9918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar with a few modifications. Synchronized cells (i.e. grown under a 12-h/12-h light/dark regime) of a cell wall-deficient C. reinhardtii strain (cw15) were grown on TAP medium to middle exponential phase (around 5 × 106 cells·ml–1). Cells were harvested at the beginning of the light period, pelleted by centrifugation (2,000 × g for 10 min), and resuspended in buffer BB (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sorbitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were lysed using a Yeda press (4.2 bar, 210 s) and briefly centrifuged (760 × g for 2 min). Mitochondria, in the supernatant, were pelleted (10,000 × g for 10 min) and further purified on Percoll gradient (27Eriksson M. Gardestrom P. Samuelsson G. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The pellet, containing intact or partially broken cells and intact chloroplasts, was resuspended in buffer BB supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and loaded on a Percoll discontinuous gradient (20, 45, and 65% Percoll). After centrifugation (4,200 × g for 15 min) intact chloroplasts were collected at the 45–65% Percoll interface (28Bollivar D.W. Beale S.I. Plant Physiol. 1996; 112: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Intact chloroplasts were washed twice in 5 volumes of buffer BB with brief centrifugation (670 × g for 2 min). Fractionation of chloroplasts was performed as previously described (29Chen H.-C. Melis A. Planta. 2004; 220: 198-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed by using a Zoom Benchtop Proteomics system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions with few modifications. Intact chloroplasts proteins (100 μg) were precipitated twice with acetone (80 and 100% v/v, respectively) and resuspended in R2D2 solubilization buffer (30Méchin V. Consoli L. Le Guilloux M. Damerval C. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 1299-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Proteins were first focused on a non-linear 3–10 pH gradient strip, then separated on a 4–12% acrylamide gradient gel. The in-gel immunodetection of Nda2 was performed using an Odyssey system (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After excision, stained polypeptides were sequenced by MS/MS as previously described (31Rumeau D. Bécuwe-Linka N. Beyly A. Louwagie M. Garin J. Peltier G. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The homology threshold given by Mascot (p value < 0.05) was 19 for the data base search that identified the protein XP_001703643. As the peptide Mascot scores were above this homology threshold (22 and 55 for spots 1 and 2, respectively), the protein was validated by inhouse software used for protein identification (IRMa, CEA/DSV/iRTSV/LEDyP). Six C. reinhardtii Genes Encode for Putative Type II NADH Dehydrogenases—A data base screening of the C. reinhardtii nuclear genome based on sequence homologies with A. thaliana NDH2 previously revealed the presence of seven gene models (NDA1 to NDA7) encoding putative type II NADH dehydrogenases (17Cardol P. Gonzalez-Halphen D. Reyes-Prieto A. Baurain D. Matagne R.F. Remacle C. Plant Physiol. 2005; 137: 447-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Among the 7 gene models initially annotated in the JGI version 2.0 of the C. reinhardtii genome, one (NDA4) was suppressed in JGI version 3.0, NDA2 and NDA4 being proposed to encode the same protein (Nda2). The six C. reinhardtii Nda amino acid sequences were compared with homologous sequences from bacteria, fungi, and plants by performing a phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1). Plant type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenases have been previously reported to group in three distinct subgroups (NDA, NDB, NDC), based on homologies with cyanobacterial and fungal sequences (15Michalecka A.M. Svensson A.S. Johansson F.I. Agius S.C. Johanson U. Brennicke A. Binder S. Rasmusson A.G. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 642-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). According to our phylogenetic analysis, the C. reinhardtii Nda2 and Nda3 appear to be, respectively, members of the plant NDB and yeast NDE/NDI groups, respectively. On the other hand, the C. reinhardtii Nda1 sequence was relatively close to plants NDA, although these sequences did not form a cladistic group (Fig. 1). Nda5, and possibly Nda6 and Nda7, appear to belong to the plant NDC group, which contains plant and cyanobacterial proteins. Nda2 was chosen in the present study for further characterization. Based on the motif prediction tool MOTIF_SCAN, the Nda2 sequence is predicted to contain a conserved nucleotide-binding motif attributed to NAD(P)H binding (Fig. 2). Although no nucleotide-binding motif was predicted in this region, the 79–110 sequence aligned with predicted FAD-binding domains of several type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenases (see supplemental Fig. S2). Although the NAD(P)H-binding motif contains the GXGXXG sequence of the ADP-binding fingerprint (32Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar), the putative flavin-binding motif contains a related sequence in which the third G residue is replaced by an A residue. Note that the presence of an A residue in place of the third G has been reported in other cases, for instance in the FAD-binding motif of the Arabidopsis NADPH-dependent thioredoxin reductase (33Dai S. Saarinen M. Ramaswamy S. Meyer Y. Jacquot J.P. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1044-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The Glu residue at the end of the second βαβ-fold domain of Nda2 indicates a likely substrate preference for NADH (14Michalecka A.M. Agius S.C. Moller I.M. Rasmusson A.G. Plant J. 2004; 37: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 34Desplats C. Beyly A. Cuine S. Bernard L. Cournac L. Peltier G. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4017-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Note that two putative Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs are predicted in the C-terminal moiety of Nda2 by using the MOTIF_SCAN software (Fig. 2). The existence of an EF-hand Ca2+-binding domain appears as a general feature of the plant NDB group. Regulation of the activity of NDH-2s by Ca2+ has been previously described in plants NDB enzymes (14Michalecka A.M. Agius S.C. Moller I.M. Rasmusson A.G. Plant J. 2004; 37: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and in the N. crassa NDE1 (35Melo A.M. Duarte M. Moller I.M. Prokisch H. Dolan P.L. Pinto L. Nelson M.A. Videira A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3947-3951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recently, Ca2+ binding was evident in AtNDB1 and AtNDB2 and shown to result from the EF-hand motif (36Geisler D.A. Broselid C. Hederstedt L. Rasmusson A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28455-28464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Nda2 protein sequence and conserved motifs. The sequence in black characters corresponds to the translation of the Nda2 cDNA (supplemental Fig. S1). The first 65 amino acids (light gray characters) were not initially predicted (JGI version 1), but were subsequently predicted in JGI versions 2 and 3 of the genome. Note that the three amino acids KDV (dark gray box with black characters) found in the cDNA sequence are not found in the JGI gene model of Nda2. Different motifs have been detected using the MOTIF_SCAN software. Light gray box (79–110): putative nucleotide-binding motif; although no FAD-binding domain was predicted using different software (InterproScan, SMART, CDD, FingerPRINTScan), this region aligns with predicted FAD-binding domains of several type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenases protein sequences (see supplemental Fig. S2). Light gray box (243–349): pyridine nucleotide-binding. Black characters figured in these two domains correspond to conserved residues of the ADP-binding fingerprint (32Wierenga R.K. Terpstra P. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). Dark gray boxes with white characters (404–432, 485–505): predicted EF-hand motifs.

The E residue at the end of the second nucleotide-binding motif (position 285) indicates a preference of Nda2 for NADH versus NADPH (34Desplats C. Beyly A. Cuine S. Bernard L. Cournac L. Peltier G.

This deleted strain grows normally on rich (LB) medium, but is unable to grow on minimal medium (M9) supplemented with mannitol as the sole source of carbon (25Bernard L. Desplats C. Mus F. Cuiné S. Cournac L. Peltier G. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3625-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The ANN022 strain harboring the pSD80-NDA2 construct was able of growth on a minimal medium in the absence of IPTG, but not in the presence of the inductor (Fig. 3A). Such a behavior, which was previously observed in the case of the A. tumefaciens NDH-2 (25Bernard L. Desplats C. Mus F. Cuiné S. Cournac L. Peltier G. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 3625-3637Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), was attributed to a promoter leakage in the absence of IPTG, and to the fact that Nda2 could be toxic at a high expression level. This interpretation is substantiated by the significant protein expression observed in the absence of IPTG (Fig. 3B) and by the growth inhibition observed when Nda2 was expressed in the control strain (AN387), after IPTG induction on a LB rich medium. We conclude from these experiments that at a low expression level, Nda2 is able to complement growth of E. coli lacking both NDH-1 and NDH-2 by interacting with the bacterial respiratory chain, while at a high expression level Nda2 is toxic for bacterial cells. Purification and Characterization of a Recombinant Nda2—Following induction by IPTG and cell disruption, Nda2 was recovered in two fractions, a solu"

In this study we report that low micromolar concentrations of arsenite synergistically increases UVR-induced oxidative DNA damage in human keratinocytes as detected by 8-hydroxyl-2'-deoxyguanine (8-OHdG) formation. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is involved in base excision repair, a process that repairs 8-OHdG lesions. Arsenite suppresses UVR-induced PARP-1 activation in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition of PARP-1 activity by 3-aminobenzamide or small interfering RNA silencing of PARP-1 expression significantly increases UVR-induced 8-OHdG formation, suggesting that inhibition of PARP-1 activity by arsenite contributes to oxidative DNA damage. PARP-1 is a zinc finger protein, and mass spectrometry analysis reveals that arsenite can occupy a synthetic apopeptide representing the first zinc finger of PARP-1 (PARPzf). When the PARPzf peptide is preincubated with Zn(II) followed by incubation with increasing concentrations of arsenite, the ZnPARPzf signal is decreased while the AsPARPzf signal intensity is increased as a function of arsenite dose, suggesting a competition between zinc and arsenite for the same binding site. Addition of Zn(II) abolished arsenite enhancement of UVR-stimulated 8-OHdG generation and restored PARP-1 activity. Our findings demonstrate that arsenite inhibits oxidative DNA damage repair and suggest that interaction of arsenite with the PARP-1 zinc finger domain contributes to the inhibition of PARP-1 activity by arsenite. Arsenite inhibition of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is one likely mechanism for the reported co-carcinogenic activities of arsenic in UVR-induced skin carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1978262912,"Estrogen receptors (ERs) alpha and beta exist as nuclear, cytoplasmic, and membrane cellular pools in a wide variety of organs. The relative contributions of each ERalpha pool to in vivo phenotypes resulting from estrogen signaling have not been determined. To address this, we generated a transgenic mouse expressing only a functional E domain of ERalpha at the plasma membrane (MOER). Cells isolated from many organs showed membrane only localized E domain of ERalpha and no other receptor pools. Liver cells from MOER and wild type mice responded to 17-beta-estradiol (E2) with comparable activation of ERK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, not seen in cells from ERalphaKO mice. Mating the MOER female mice with proven male wild type breeders produced no pregnancies because the uterus and vagina of the MOER female mice were extremely atrophic. Ovaries of MOER and homozygous Strasbourg ERalphaKO mice showed multiple hemorrhagic cysts and no corpus luteum, and the mammary gland development in both MOER and ERalphaKO mice was rudimentary. Despite elevated serum E2 levels, serum LH was not suppressed, and prolactin levels were low in MOER mice. MOER and Strasbourg female mice showed plentiful abdominal visceral and other depots of fat and increased body weight compared to wild type mice despite comparable food consumption. These results provide strong evidence that the normal development and adult functions of important organs in female mice requires nuclear ERalpha and is not rescued by membrane ERalpha domain expression alone."
https://openalex.org/W2104847673,"The first step in mammalian fertilization, where both species specificity and the one-sperm-per-egg norm are enforced, is recognition between coat proteins in the membrane around the egg (the zona pellucida) and sperm. The mouse zona pellucida protein ZP3 is the primary receptor for sperm and its most conserved domain (ZP-N) is also found in many different extracellular proteins with a wide range of biological functions. The crystal structure of the ZP-N domain of ZP3 has now been determined. ZP-N adopts an immunoglobulin-like fold but shares little similarity with other immunoglobulin-like domains, marking it out as a new subtype of this superfamily. As well as providing a glimpse of mammalian fertilization at atomic resolution, the structure of ZP3 ZP-N is of relevance for reproductive medicine and also for diseases such as non-syndromic deafness or renal and vascular disorders, where ZP-N containing proteins are involved. Species-specific recognition between the egg extracellular matrix (zona pellucida) and sperm is the first step of mammalian fertilization. This paper reports the 2.3 Å resolution structure of the 'zona pellucida filament' of the egg, which act as sperm receptors. The structure supports the presence of ZP–N repeats within the amino-terminal region of ZP2 and other vertebrate zona pellucida/vitelline proteins, and has implications for egg coat architecture and the post-fertilization block to polyspermy and speciation. Species-specific recognition between the egg extracellular matrix (zona pellucida) and sperm is the first, crucial step of mammalian fertilization1. Zona pellucida filament components ZP3 and ZP2 act as sperm receptors, and mice lacking either of the corresponding genes produce oocytes without a zona pellucida and are completely infertile2. Like their counterparts in the vitelline envelope of non-mammalian eggs and many other secreted eukaryotic proteins, zona pellucida subunits polymerize using a ‘zona pellucida (ZP) domain’ module3,4,5, whose conserved amino-terminal part (ZP-N) was suggested to constitute a domain of its own6. No atomic structure has been reported for ZP domain proteins, and there is no structural information on any conserved vertebrate protein that is essential for fertilization and directly involved in egg–sperm binding. Here we describe the 2.3 ångström (Å) resolution structure of the ZP-N fragment of mouse primary sperm receptor ZP3. The ZP-N fold defines a new immunoglobulin superfamily subtype with a β-sheet extension characterized by an E′ strand and an invariant tyrosine residue implicated in polymerization. The structure strongly supports the presence of ZP-N repeats within the N-terminal region of ZP2 and other vertebrate zona pellucida/vitelline envelope proteins, with implications for overall egg coat architecture, the post-fertilization block to polyspermy and speciation. Moreover, it provides an important framework for understanding human diseases caused by mutations in ZP domain proteins and developing new methods of non-hormonal contraception."

Despite its importance, this goal remains elusive. The work described here utilizes epitope tagging of cellulose synthase A (CESA) proteins that are known components of the CSC. To avoid problems associated with preferential purification of CESA monomers, we developed a strategy based on dual epitope tagging of the CESA7 protein to select for CESA multimers. With this approach, we used a two-step purification that preferentially selected for larger CESA oligomers. These preparations consisted solely of the three known secondary cell wall CESA proteins CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8. No additional CESA isoforms or other proteins were identified. The data are consistent with a model in which CESA protein homodimerization occurs prior to formation of larger CESA oligomers. This suggests that the three different CESA proteins undergo dimerization independently, but the presence of all three subunits is required for higher order oligomerization. Analysis of purified CESA complex and crude extracts suggests that disulfide bonds and noncovalent interactions contribute to the stability of the CESA subunit interactions.

Protoplasma.. 1986; 134: 111-120Google Scholar). Most estimates suggest that each lobe of the rosette is itself a hexamer, such that the CSC is a 36-mer (4Somerville C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Bot.. 2005; 96: 9-21Google Scholar). Although the CSC is likely to be a major factor in determining microfibril structure, very little information is known about its organization. The only components of the CSC that have been identified to date are the cellulose synthase A (CESA) proteins that are presumed to be the catalytic subunits of the CSC (1Delmer D.P. Annu. Rev.

The CESA family has been most intensively studied in Arabidopsis, and these studies have utilized the characterization of a wide range of mutants (4Somerville C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

In primary cell walls a number of CESA proteins have been shown to be required for cellulose synthesis. Both CESA1 and CESA3 are essential (13Arioli T. Peng L.C. Betzner A.S. Burn J. Wittke W.

In contrast, CESA2, CESA5, and CESA9 appear to be partially redundant with CESA6 (18Desprez T. Juraniec M. Crowell E.F. Jouy H. Pochylova Z. Parcy F. Hofte H. Gonneau M. Vernhettes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2007; 104: 15572-15577Google Scholar, 19Persson S. Paredez A. Carroll A. Palsdottir H. Doblin M. Poindexter P. Khitrov N. Auer M. Somerville C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2007; 104: 15566-15571Google Scholar). The situation is different in the secondary cell walls of developing xylem vessels where three nonredundant CESA proteins are required for cellulose synthesis: CESA4 (20Taylor N.G. Howells R.M. Huttly A.K. Vickers K. Turner S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2003; 100: 1450-1455Google Scholar), CESA7 (21Taylor N.G. Scheible W.R. Cutler S. Somerville C.R. Turner S.R. Plant Cell.. 1999; 11: 769-780Google Scholar), and CESA8 (22Taylor N.G. Laurie S. Turner S.R. Plant Cell.. 2000; 12: 2529-2540Google Scholar). Mutations compromising the function of any one of these three CESA proteins cause a severe deficiency in the deposition of cellulose in secondary cell walls, which exhibit a characteristic irregular xylem (irx) phenotype caused by a collapse of xylem vessels (23Turner S.R. Somerville C.R. Plant Cell.. 1997; 9: 689-701Google Scholar). The irx1, irx3, and irx5 mutants are caused by mutations in the CESA8, CESA7, and CESA4 genes, respectively. A study of Arabidopsis secondary cell wall CSC composition will therefore have the significant advantage that only three CESA subunits are likely to be present. Furthermore, the irx mutants, which are only deficient in secondary cell wall CSCs, will be a very useful tool in such a study. The nonredundant CESA isoforms in both primary and secondary cell walls have been shown by co-immunoprecipitation to interact with one another (18Desprez T. Juraniec M. Crowell E.F. Jouy H.

A.. 2003; 100: 1450-1455Google Scholar). In a recent study using blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) of solubilized cell extracts, Wang et al. (24Wang J. Elliott J.E. Williamson R.E. J. Exp. Bot.. 2008; 59: 2627-2637Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of primary cell wall CESA proteins as part of a large (840 kDa) complex. This study did not, however, attempt to purify this complex or determine its composition. Although it is widely assumed that a minimum of three CESA proteins are required for and involved in CSC assembly, there is currently little information on whether proteins other than CESAs are present in the complex or how the CSC is organized and assembled. The only definitive method of answering many of the outstanding questions of cellulose synthesis is to isolate an intact, pure, and fully functional complex. Although this goal is a prerequisite to proper biochemical and structural analyses by techniques such as single particle averaging, to date, it remains elusive. Various attempts to purify the complex biochemically have identified a number of potential components but have failed to identify the CESA proteins, the only known components of the complex (3Kudlicka K. Brown R.M. Plant Physiol.. 1997; 115: 643-656Google Scholar). More recently cellulose synthase activity has been unambiguously identified in a solubilized membrane preparation from blackberry (25Lai-Kee-Him J. Chanzy H. Muller M. Putaux J.L. Imai T. Bulone V. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 36931-36939Google Scholar); however, because these preparations do not constitute a purified CSC, further analysis is impeded. We have employed an epitope tagging approach to purify a secondary cell wall CESA-containing complex under nondenaturing conditions. In combination with nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, this approach has been used to elucidate the subunit composition, determine how CESA proteins assemble, and examine the nature of the interactions between subunits. Plant Material—Wild type Arabidopsis (Landsberg erecta ecotype), irx1-1, irx3-1, and irx5-2 mutant plants and all transgenic plants were grown as described previously (20Taylor N.G. Howells R.M. Huttly A.K. Vickers K. Turner S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2003; 100: 1450-1455Google Scholar, 23Turner S.R. Somerville C.R. Plant Cell.. 1997; 9: 689-701Google Scholar). Vectors and Plant Transformation—An 8.3-kb XhoI-MunI genomic DNA fragment carrying the entire CESA7 coding region and the 1.7-kb promoter sequence was cloned into pCB2300 (22Taylor N.G. Laurie S. Turner S.R. Plant Cell.. 2000; 12: 2529-2540Google Scholar). To insert the RGSHHHHHH (His)-FLAG epitope, a double-stranded oligonucleotide (5′-CTAGCAGGGGATCCCATCACCATCACCATCACGACTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAG-3′ sense and 5′-CTAGCCTTGTCATCGTCATCCTTGTAGTCGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGGATCCCCTG-3′ antisense) was ligated into a unique NheI site such that the tag was inserted 4 amino acids from the N terminus of CESA7. Vectors for plant expression of the StrepII (STREP)-tagged CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8 were constructed using the p3HSC Gateway destination vector derived from pCB1300 by insertion of the 1.7-kb CESA7 promoter sequences (22Taylor N.G. Laurie S. Turner S.R. Plant Cell.. 2000; 12: 2529-2540Google Scholar), the StrepII tag sequence (26Skerra A. Schmidt T.G. Methods Enzymol.. 2000; 326: 271-304Google Scholar), the frame A (attR1/CmR/ccdB/attR2) cassette (Invitrogen), and the nitric-oxide synthase terminator from pGPTV-BAR (27Becker D. Kemper E. Schell J. Masterson R. Plant Mol. Biol.. 1992; 20: 1195-1197Google Scholar). Entry clones were obtained by inserting CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8 amplified cDNA fragments into pDONOR-Zeo using PCR primers for CESA4 (primers 5GF, 5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTTCGCCATGGAACCAACACC-3′; 5GR, 5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTTATCTGTGAATCTTTTACTGTG-3′), CESA7 (primers 3GF, 5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTTCCCTATGGAAGCTAGCGC-3′; 3GR, 5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTTATCTGTGAATCTTTTACTGTG-3′), and CESA8 (primers 1GF, 5′-AAAAAGCAGGCTCGAAGATGATGGAGTCTAGG-3′; 1GR, 5′-AGAAAGCTGGGTGCTCAAGCAACCATATAA-3′). The cDNAs were subcloned into p3HSC, producing expression vectors that contained tagged versions of CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8, and then irx5-2, irx3-1, and irx1-1 plants, respectively, were transformed by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (28Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J.. 1998; 16: 735-743Google Scholar). Phenotype and Cellulose Analysis—Stem sections were stained with toluidine blue to determine the structure of the vascular bundle. The bottom 5 cm of the mature stem was used for cellulose measurements, as described (23Turner S.R. Somerville C.R. Plant Cell.. 1997; 9: 689-701Google Scholar). Microsome Extraction and Solubilization—The stems were ground at 4 °C in two volumes of buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1× protease inhibitor Complete (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA). Following centrifugation for 1 min at 500 × g and the addition of ∼10% (v/v) glycerol, the extracted samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until use. Before purification, the samples were rapidly thawed and loaded on the top of a 30% (w/v) sucrose cushion. The microsome fraction was collected after ultracentrifugation for 45 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in buffer A. The microsome fraction was solubilized with Triton X-100 or dodecyl β-d-maltoside (DDM) at a protein:detergent ratio of ∼1:2 at 4 °C for 30 min with rotation. His/STREP Tag Affinity Purification—Ten ml of the solubilized microsome preparation was diluted to 1% (w/v) detergent with buffer A and then incubated with 0.6 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow (Qiagen) at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation. After three washes with 6 ml of buffer B (buffer A, 0.2% (w/v) detergent) with 30 mm imidazole, the bound proteins were eluted with 3 × 0.6 ml of buffer B containing 250 mm imidazole. Eluted proteins were diluted with buffer B to a final imidazole concentration of 100 mm (to give the His sample). Up to 10 ml of the His sample were passed slowly through a 1-ml gravity flow Strep-Tactin Sepharose column (IBA). After five washes with 1 ml of buffer B, the bound proteins were eluted with 6 × 0.5 ml of buffer B containing 2.5 mm desthiobiotin. Fractions 2-5 were pooled to obtain the purified His/STREP sample. When necessary, the purified sample was concentrated by centrifugation in a Microcon YM100 column (Millipore) or by incubation with 0.1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow and eluting the protein directly from the resin by incubation with SDS/DTT loading buffer at 65 °C. His/FLAG Tag Tandem Affinity Purification—One volume of streptavidin magnetic beads M-280 (Dynabeads, Dynal Biotech) were mixed with 10 volumes of 10 μg/ml anti-FLAG BioM2 biotin conjugated antibody (Sigma), incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and washed five times with buffer B. The protein sample eluted from the His tag purification step was incubated with anti-FLAG BioM2/magnetic beads for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times with buffer B05 (buffer B containing 0.5% (w/v) detergent), and subsequently eluted with different concentrations of FLAG and 3× FLAG peptides (Sigma) ranging from 200 to 2000 μg/ml in buffer B05 alone or in combination with other elution agents. For SDS/PAGE and LC-MS/MS analysis, concentrated magnetic beads with the bound proteins were incubated in SDS/PAGE sample buffer at 65 °C for 15 min. Pull-down Assay—Equal volumes of the solubilized microsome fraction were treated for 30 min at 4 °C with various concentrations of DTT, NaCl, and Sarkosyl (sodium lauroyl sarcosinate) prior to incubation with Strep-Tactin resin. The final volumes of all samples were adjusted to 4 ml with buffer B. The treatments with NaCl and Sarkosyl were performed with and without 10 mm DTT. The samples were then incubated with 100 μl of Strep-Tactin Sepharose (IBA GmbH). After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation, the samples were washed three times with buffer B, pelleted, and incubated in SDS/PAGE sample buffer at 65 °C for 15 min. Gel Electrophoresis and Blotting—BN gels (3.5-15% (w/v) acrylamide, 250 mm 6-aminohexanoic acid, and 0.1% (w/v) DDM, when DDM solubilized) were prepared and run at 4 °C as described (29Wittig I. Braun H.P. Schagger H. Nat. Prot.. 2006; 1: 418-428Google Scholar) using of ∼80 μg of protein/lane. Vertical strips of the gel corresponding to the individual lanes were incubated with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3% (w/v) SDS, 100 mm DTT for 30 min at 65 °C and run on a second dimension of SDS-PAGE. For one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, the protein samples were incubated in sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm DTT) for 20 min at 65 °C. After separation the proteins were transferred to immunoblot PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad) and subjected to immunoblot analysis with CESA4-, CESA7-, and CESA8-specific antibodies and detected using an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody as previously described (20Taylor N.G. Howells R.M. Huttly A.K. Vickers K. Turner S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2003; 100: 1450-1455Google Scholar). For chemiluminescent detection of the horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody, a SuperSignal West substrate mixture (Pierce) was used. Silver staining was performed as described (30Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem.. 1996; 68: 850-858Google Scholar), and colloidal Coomassie staining was by PageBlue protein staining (Fermentas). The stain intensity in the Western blots and stained gels was quantified using Imaging Densitometer GS710 and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Mass Spectrometry—The protein bands of interest were excised from the gel, washed, reduced, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested with trypsin using a modified version of the procedure described (31Nomura E. Katsuta K. Ueda T. Toriyama M. Mori T. Inagaki N. J. Mass Spectrom.. 2004; 39: 202-207Google Scholar). The extracted peptides were characterized by LC-MS/MS on a Q-TOF Micro (Waters), and the data produced were searched against the Mass Spectroscopy Database using Mascot searching software (Matrix Science). Analysis of CESA Proteins Using Two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE—The secondary cell wall CESA proteins can be effectively solubilized from a stem microsomal fraction with 2% DDM or 2% Triton X-100 (approximate protein:detergent ratio of 1:2). BN-PAGE and immunoblotting using a CESA7-primary antibody and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody detected two broad bands with approximate molecule masses of 700 and 440 kDa and diffuse bands of ∼100 kDa (Fig. 1A). It was hard to reliably detect low levels of CESA protein; therefore to improve the sensitivity, a HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and chemiluminescence detection was used (Fig. 1B). The interpretation of these data was hampered by the appearance of background bands that were visible in the absence of both primary and secondary antibodies and that were generated from a small unknown protein (molecular mass, ∼30 kDa) with inherent peroxidase activity that formed part of a larger complex (supplemental Fig. S1). To overcome this problem, a second dimension of conventional SDS-PAGE was utilized. The results from immunoblots after two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE of a DDM-solubilized stem microsomal fraction showed that the three CESA proteins (CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8) each possessed a similar pattern corresponding to the presence of a CESA monomer of ∼120 kDa as well as various oligomers (Fig. 1C). The largest observed CESA oligomers had a molecular mass ∼700-730 kDa. The patterns of all three CESA subunits contained oligomers with molecular masses of 440 and 220 kDa. The CESA8 protein was slightly less well resolved, possibly because of poorer detection of the protein, but the general pattern of monomeric and oligomeric forms was equivalent to CESA4 and CESA7. A truncated CESA7 form (a specific proteolytic product), observed previously in SDS-PAGE immunoblots (32Taylor N.G. Gardiner J.C. Wightman R. Turner S.R. Cellulose.. 2004; 11: 329-338Google Scholar), was also present in multiple oligomeric forms (Fig. 1C). Similar, but less intense truncated forms were observed for CESA8 and for the 440-kDa oligomer of CESA4. Analysis of CESA Proteins in irx3 and irx5 Mutants—The irx3-1 and irx5-2 mutations are caused by premature stop codons that result in protein truncation of CESA7 and CESA4, respectively (20Taylor N.G. Howells R.M. Huttly A.K. Vickers K. Turner S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2003; 100: 1450-1455Google Scholar, 21Taylor N.G. Scheible W.R. Cutler S. Somerville C.R. Turner S.R. Plant Cell.. 1999; 11: 769-780Google Scholar). In the irx3-1 background, interaction between CESA4 and CESA8 is greatly reduced, and the proteins fail to localize to the plasma membrane (20Taylor N.G. Howells R.M. Huttly A.K. Vickers K. Turner S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2003; 100: 1450-1455Google Scholar, 33Gardiner J.C. Taylor N.G. Turner S.R. Plant Cell.. 2003; 15: 1740-1748Google Scholar). Consequently, it is assumed that these mutants do not assemble a functional CSC. To examine the organization of CESA proteins in these mutant backgrounds, two-dimensional BN/SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting was performed on stem protein extracts from irx3-1 and irx5-2. CESA4 and CESA8 migrated with predominant bands with molecular masses of 120 and 240 kDa in the irx3-1 mutant, corresponding to the size of a CESA monomer and dimer (Fig. 2). Similarly CESA7 and CESA8 migrated in a similar manner in extracts from the irx5-2 mutant (Fig. 2), suggesting that homodimerization precludes complex assembly. Tandem Tag Purification of CESA Proteins—CESA7 can incorporate a His tag insertion at the N terminus and remain functional (22Taylor N.G. Laurie S. Turner S.R. Plant Cell.. 2000; 12: 2529-2540Google Scholar, 33Gardiner J.C. Taylor N.G. Turner S.R. Plant Cell.. 2003; 15: 1740-1748Google Scholar). Although His-CESA7 can be purified using this single tag, it is not sufficient to generate a purified CESA complex (32Taylor N.G. Gardiner J.C. Wightman R. Turner S.R. Cellulose.. 2004; 11: 329-338Google Scholar). As an alternative approach for CESA complex purification, a functional CESA7 construct carrying N-terminal His and FLAG tags arranged in tandem was expressed in irx3-1 plants, which lack CESA7. The FLAG tag allows competitive elution with a FLAG peptide under nondenaturing conditions for various types of protein (34Einhauer A. Jungbauer A. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods.. 2001; 49: 455-465Google Scholar). It was possible to obtain a highly purified preparation of His/FLAG-CESA7; however, elution of native CESA proteins from anti-FLAG antibody beads using FLAG peptides alone or in combination with other reagents (including 1 m urea or glycine-HCl pH 2.8), was very inefficient (data not shown). In contrast, resin-bound His/FLAG-CESA7 was efficiently released using an SDS/DTT denaturing buffer (supplemental Fig. S2). The His/FLAG-purified sample was compared with a wild type extract subjected to the same purification procedure. Following separation using SDS-PAGE, a very strong band in the His/FLAG-CESA7 fraction was clearly visible at 110 kDa, the size predicted for tagged CESA7 (supplemental Fig. S3) with several fainter bands that were not present in the wild type control. Both CESA4 and CESA7 were identified in the major 110-kDa band by LC-MS/MS analysis, indicating that they were co-purified. CESA8 was not identified in this experiment most likely because it is masked by an excess of CESA7. The presence of CESA8 was, however, demonstrated by Western analysis. A further 13 bands were analyzed that were present in the tagged extract, but not in the wild type (supplemental Fig. S3). These bands contained either CESA7 and/or CESA4 (supplemental Table S1). Other proteins were also detected such as keratin and the Ig γ chain, which are contaminating proteins with similar gel mobility to the CESA7 and/or CESA4 bands. CESA4 and CESA7 degradation products were detected in bands with molecular masses below 110 kDa, whereas CESA proteins that aggregated with one another or with other proteins were present in bands that migrated with a molecular mass greater than 110 kDa. CESA Purification Using a Dual Tagging System—A major limitation of the His/FLAG tag purification system is that elution with SDS/DTT buffer precludes purification of native CESA proteins. Also, this system cannot discriminate between the monomeric forms of His/FLAG-CESA7 and those associated with larger oligomeric forms that presumably form part of the CSC. The excess of CESA7 compared with CESA4 or CESA8 is likely to result from preferential purification of the monomeric and lower oligomers of His/FLAG-CESA7 rather than the intact complex, because of their much smaller size. To overcome these problems, a dual His/STREP tag system was developed. It consists of a His and StrepII (STREP) tag inserted separately into two different CESA isoforms. A STREP-tagged protein is eluted with the low molecular weight agent (desthio)-biotin rather than by antibody binding (26Skerra A. Schmidt T.G. Methods Enzymol.. 2000; 326: 271-304Google Scholar, 35Junttila M.R. Saarinen S. Schmidt T. Kast J. Westermarck J. Proteomics.. 2005; 5: 1199-1203Google Scholar). Successful STREP-tagged protein purification was recently reported for membrane proteins and protein complexes (35Junttila M.R. Saarinen S. Schmidt T. Kast J. Westermarck J. Proteomics.. 2005; 5: 1199-1203Google Scholar, 36Chang I.F. Proteomics.. 2006; 6: 6158-6166Google Scholar). The STREP tag was inserted at the N terminus of CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8, and the recombinant proteins were expressed in irx5-2, irx3-1, and irx1-1 mutant backgrounds, respectively. Cellulose contents of irx5-2:STREP-CESA4 and irx1-1:STREP-CESA8 plants were much lower than wild type and as such were not fully functional (supplemental Table S2). irx3-1 plants expressing STREP-CESA7 had wild type cellulose content and xylem phenotypes. Because multiple CESA7 proteins are present in the CSC, we utilized STREP-CESA7 and His/FLAG-CESA7 in a dual tag system. irx3-1:STREP-CESA7 Plants Were Crossed with irx3-1:His/FLAG—CESA7 plants and homozygous progeny expressing both transgenes were selected and used for purification under nondenaturing conditions. Double transgenic (His/STREP-CESA7) plants had wild type cellulose content and normal xylem phenotype (supplemental Table S2). Stem microsome fractions from His/STREP-CESA7 plants solubilized with Triton X-100 or DDM were used for tandem His/STREP affinity purification under native conditions. Successive His and STREP purification yielded highly purified preparations predominantly composed of proteins of ∼110 kDa (Fig. 3A) that contained CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8, as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 3B). The dual His/STREP tag purification procedure yielded 3-15 μg of protein samples from microsome fractions extracted from 50-70 g of stem material. Protein bands purified from concentrated His/STREP-CESA7 samples from Triton X-100- or DDM-solubilized microsomes were subjected to analysis using LC-MS/MS. Only CESA4, CESA7, and CESA8 proteins were identified, including the prominent degradation product of CESA7 and a high molecular weight form of CESA7 that ran at ∼220 kDa (Fig. 4). No other CESA family members or any other proteins were identified. Some very faint bands were visible in the highly concentrated sample, which were below the MS detection limit.FIGURE 4SDS-PAGE of concentrated His/STREP-purified samples and LC-MS/MS identification of CESA proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2047178927,"Projecting or moving up a chemical gradient is a universal behavior of living organisms. We tested the ability of S. cerevisiaea-cells to sense and respond to spatial gradients of the mating pheromone alpha-factor produced in a microfluidics chamber; the focus was on bar1Delta strains, which do not degrade the pheromone input. The yeast cells exhibited good accuracy with the mating projection typically pointing in the correct direction up the gradient ( approximately 80% under certain conditions), excellent sensitivity to shallow gradients, and broad dynamic range so that gradient-sensing was relatively robust over a 1000-fold range of average alpha-factor concentrations. Optimal directional sensing occurred at lower concentrations (5 nM) close to the K(d) of the receptor and with steeper gradient slopes. Pheromone supersensitive mutations (sst2Delta and ste2(300Delta)) that disrupt the down-regulation of heterotrimeric G-protein signaling caused defects in both sensing and response. Interestingly, yeast cells employed adaptive mechanisms to increase the robustness of the process including filamentous growth (i.e. directional distal budding) up the gradient at low pheromone concentrations, bending of the projection to be more aligned with the gradient, and forming a more accurate second projection when the first projection was in the wrong direction. Finally, the cells were able to amplify a shallow external gradient signal of alpha-factor to produce a dramatic polarization of signaling proteins at the front of the cell. Mathematical modeling revealed insights into the mechanism of this amplification and how the supersensitive mutants can disrupt accurate polarization. Together, these data help to specify and elucidate the abilities of yeast cells to sense and respond to spatial gradients of pheromone."
https://openalex.org/W2033538931,"Cadmium poses a significant threat to human health due to its toxicity. In mammals and in bakers' yeast, cadmium is detoxified by ATP-binding cassette transporters after conjugation to glutathione. In fission yeast, phytochelatins constitute the co-substrate with cadmium for the transporter SpHMT1. In plants, a detoxification mechanism similar to the one in fission yeast is supposed, but the molecular nature of the transporter is still lacking. To investigate further the relationship between SpHMT1 and its co-substrate, we overexpressed the transporter in a Schizosaccharomyces pombe strain deleted for the phytochelatin synthase gene and heterologously in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in Escherichia coli. In all organisms, overexpression of SpHMT1 conferred a markedly enhanced tolerance to cadmium but not to Sb(III), AgNO3, As(III), As(V), CuSO4, or HgCl2. Abolishment of the catalytic activity by expression of SpHMT1K623M mutant suppressed the cadmium tolerance phenotype independently of the presence of phytochelatins. Depletion of the glutathione pool inhibited the SpHMT1 activity but not that of AtHMA4, a P-type ATPase, indicating that GSH is necessary for the SpHMT1-mediated cadmium resistance. In E. coli, SpHMT1 was targeted to the periplasmic membrane and led to an increased amount of cadmium in the periplasm. These results demonstrate that SpHMT1 confers cadmium tolerance in the absence of phytochelatins but depending on the presence of GSH and ATP. Our results challenge the dogma of the two separate cadmium detoxification pathways and demonstrate that a common highly conserved mechanism has been selected during the evolution from bacteria to humans.

Our results challenge the dogma of the two separate cadmium detoxification pathways and demonstrate that a common highly conserved mechanism has been selected during the evolution from bacteria to humans. Cadmium is a trace element, the presence of which in the environment is essentially due to human activities. It is a highly toxic non-biological heavy metal able to enter living cells via transporters usually used for the uptake of essential cations such as calcium, iron, zinc, and so forth (1Clemens S. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 1707-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). The reactivity of cadmium with thiol groups and its ability to displace essential biological metals result in oxidative stress and eventually cell death (2Tamas M. Labarre J. Toledano M.B. Wysocki R. Top. Curr. Genet. 2006; 1: 395-435Google Scholar). To cope with cadmium toxicity, living organisms have developed different strategies. In animals, as in the bakers' yeast cytoplasmic cadmium is complexed with the thiol tripeptide glutathione, a general redox regulator (3Pastore A. Federici G. Bertini E. Piemonte F. Clin. Chim. Acta. 2003; 333: 19-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 4Meyer A.J. J. Plant Physiol. 2008; 165: 1390-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).

The prototypical transporter of Cd-GS2 is the GS-X pump, ScYCF1, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (5Li Z.S. Lu Y.P. Zhen R.G. Szczypka M. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) and, even if still controversial, to a lesser extent HsMRP1 in humans (6Tommasini R. Evers R. Vogt E. Mornet C. Zaman G.J. Schinkel A.H. Borst P. Martinoia E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6743-6748Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). HsMRP1 probably acts as an efflux pump at the plasma membrane, delivering cadmium in the extracellular medium, whereas ScYCF1 allows sequestration of cadmium into the vacuole (5Li Z.S. Lu Y.P. Zhen R.G. Szczypka M. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). A study of a deficient Scycf1 strain has shown that it was extremely cadmium-sensitive, pointing to a major role of ScYCF1 in cadmium tolerance and detoxification (5Li Z.S. Lu Y.P. Zhen R.G. Szczypka M. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Additionally, ScYCF1 was also found involved in arsenic, antimony, mercury, and lead detoxification (references cited within Ref. 7Prévéral S. Ansoborlo E. Mari S. Vavasseur A. Forestier C. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 1651-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A second strategy of cadmium detoxification is found in plants (8Grill E. Winnacker E.L. Zenk M.H. Science. 1985; 230: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), with the exception of mosses, and in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (9Kondo N. Imai K. Isobe M. Goto T. Murasugi A. Wada-Nakagawa C. Hayashi Y. Tetrahedron Lett. 1984; 25: 3869-3872Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In that case, cytoplasmic cadmium is chelated by enzymatically synthesized thiol peptides, phytochelatins of the structure (γ-Glu-Cys)n-Gly, where n equals 2–11 (10Grill E. Loffler S. Winnacker E.L. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6838-6842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These peptides are produced upon cadmium exposure by the constitutively expressed phytochelatin synthase enzyme (11Cobbett C.S. Trends Plant. Sci. 1999; 4: 335-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the structure of which has been recently resolved (12Vivares D. Arnoux P. Pignol D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 18848-18853Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The complex phytochelatin-cadmium (PC-Cd) is then transferred to the vacuole by undetermined transporter(s) in plants and by the ABC half-transporter, SpHMT1, in S. pombe (13Ortiz D.F. Ruscitti T. Mccue K.F. Ow D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4721-4728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 14Ortiz D.F. Kreppel L. Speiser D.M. Scheel G. Mcdonald G. Ow D.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that in S. pombe, a mutation of the phytochelatin synthase enzyme, SpPCS, or of the SpHMT1 transporter led to similar cadmium-hypersensitive phenotypes (15Clemens S. J. Plant Physiol. 2006; 163: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This indicates that the transfer of PC-Cd complexes from the cytoplasm to the vacuole is essential in cadmium resistance in this organism. In mammals, besides GSH, cadmium can be detoxified after association with metallothioneins, a superfamily of ubiquitous cysteine-rich low molecular weight proteins. These biomolecules, discovered as cadmium-containing proteins in horse kidney, have extremely high metal and sulfur contents (up to 10% w/w) (16Henkel G. Krebs B. Chem. Rev. 2004; 104: 801-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). More recently, it appears that cadmium can be taken up, as a free metallic cation, by energized transporters from the P1b-ATPases family. For instance, CadA and AtHMA4 are efficient cadmium transporters, respectively, in Listeria monocytogenes and in Arabidopsis thaliana (17Lebrun M. Audurier A. Cossart P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3040-3048Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Verret F. Gravot A. Auroy P. Preveral S. Forestier C. Vavasseur A. Richaud P. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, if the detoxification activity of ScYCF1 (or HsMRP1 in humans) is GSH-dependent, cadmium transporters from the P1b-ATPases family are functional in the absence of GSH. This scheme, discriminating different strategies engaged by plants and animals in cadmium detoxification, has recently been ruled out by the discovery of a functional phytochelatin synthase enzyme in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans that is able to complement the cadmium sensitivity of an S. pombe PCS knock-out strain (19Vatamaniuk O.K. Bucher E.A. Sundaram M.V. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23684-23690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). CePCS1-deficient worms were found markedly more sensitive to cadmium intoxication, leading to the first demonstration of the PC-mediated detoxification of cadmium in an animal (19Vatamaniuk O.K. Bucher E.A. Sundaram M.V. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23684-23690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In fact, potential phytochelatin synthase orthologs have been found in a large list of eukaryotes outside the plant kingdom (20Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 507-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The identification of an ortholog of the ABC transporter SpHMT1 in C. elegans, CeHMT-1, has completed the homology between the S. pombe and C. elegans pathways for cadmium detoxification (15Clemens S. J. Plant Physiol. 2006; 163: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 19Vatamaniuk O.K. Bucher E.A. Sundaram M.V. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23684-23690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Strikingly, CeHMT-1-deficient worms were found strongly more sensitive to cadmium than CePCS1-deficient worms (19Vatamaniuk O.K. Bucher E.A. Sundaram M.V. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23684-23690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), suggesting that the role of CeHMT-1 was not limited to the transport of PC-Cd in cadmium tolerance. In the present study, we show that SpHMT1 overexpression is able to confer cadmium tolerance in organisms devoid of phytochelatins, such as S. cerevisiae and Escherichia coli. This function requires the presence of glutathione in the cell and a functional ATP-binding domain in the protein. Yeast Strains, Bacterial Strains, and Growth Conditions—The S. cerevisiae strains were provided from the EUROSCARF collection. Y0000 (BY4741; MATa; his3D1; met15D0; ura3D0) and the Scycf1 mutant Y04069 (BY4741; YDR135c::kanMX4) were grown at 30 °C in complete medium (yeast extract peptone dextrose; YPD) or in synthetic medium with dextrose (all amino acids). The transformed yeast were grown in selective medium (synthetic medium with dextrose without uracil) containing 2% of dextrose, raffinose, or galactose. The S. pombe strains were the previously described the SpHMT1-deficient Δhmt1 strain LK100 and the corresponding S. pombe wild-type strain Sp223 (h–ade6-216, leu1-32, ura4-294) (13Ortiz D.F.

Kim E.J. Neumann D. Schroeder J.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3325-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Transformation of S. pombe was performed as described previously (22Suga M. Hatakeyama T. Yeast. 2001; 18: 1015-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cells were routinely grown at 30 °C in complete (YPD medium or Edinburgh's minimal medium (EMM) supplemented appropriately (i.e. without Leu (EMM–Leu) as described previously (23Moreno S. Klar A. Nurse P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 795-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (3104) Google Scholar). Medium containing different concentrations of CdCl2 was prepared immediately prior to the growth experiment. Plates used for the cadmium spot test were prepared by adding the indicated concentration of CdCl2 to the minimal plate medium. Plasmid constructions and gene expression were performed in the E. coli strains Top10 (Invitrogen). Bacteria cells were grown at 37 °C in liquid Luria-Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotics. Plasmid Constructs—Plasmid pART-SpHMT1 contains the complete hmt1 open reading frame (13Ortiz D.F. Ruscitti T. Mccue K.F. Ow D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4721-4728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Plasmids pART-SpHMT1 and pEGFP-N2 (BD Biosciences) were used to generate a SpHMT1-EGFP-N2 fusion by the “splicing by overlap extension” technique as already described (7Prévéral S. Ansoborlo E.

To generate a plasmid expressing SpHMT1-GFP in E. coli, the pUC-SpHMT1-GFP was constructed in two steps. First, two primers (SpHMT1–7, 5′-CTCTAGAGAAGGAGATATACATATGGTTCTACGTTACAACAGCC-3′; SpHMT1–8, 5′-GGTAGGCCTTTAGTATGGAATC-3′) were designed to amplify by PCR (annealing temperature of 50 °C, elongation time of 1 min) a 400-bp fragment containing the first 379 bp of hmt1, the appropriate 5′-ribosomal-binding site (RBS) sequence upstream of hmt1 open reading frame start codon, and an XbaI restriction site in 5′ position. PCR product was sequenced, digested by XbaI, and cloned into the XbaI-SmaI digested plasmid pUC19 (New England Biolabs) to obtain the pUC-PCR-RBS-SpHMT1. Finally, a 2.8-kb StuI-SacI fragment from pART-SpHMT1GFP was subcloned into the same sites of pUC-PCR-RBS-SpHMT1 to obtain pUC-SpHMT1-GFP. All plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. Plasmids pYES2 expressing EGFP-N2, YCF1, or YCF1-EGFP-N2 were previously described (7Prévéral S. Ansoborlo E. Mari S. Vavasseur A. Forestier C. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 1651-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The plasmid pYES HMT1-EGFP-N2 was generated by HindIII-SacI digestions of pUC-HMT1-GFP and pYES2. The plasmid pUC-SpHMT1K623M-GFP was the result of a directed mutagenesis using the Stratagene QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit with two primers: SpHMT1-F-K623M, 5′-TCAGGTGGTGGGATGTCTACAATTATG-3′, and SpHMT1-R-K623M, 5′-CATAATTGTAGACATCCCACCACCTGA-3′. This plasmid was used to create pART SpHMT1K623M-GFP by BglII-ScaI digestion in the pART SpHMT1-GFP and pYES2 HMT1K623M-EGFP-N2 after ligation of HindIII-SacI fragment with the pYES2 digested by the same enzymes. Plasmid pYES2 HMA4-EGFP-N2 was previously described (18Verret F. Gravot A. Auroy P. Preveral S. Forestier C. Vavasseur A. Richaud P. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Growth Inhibition by Cadmium and Determination of Metal Content—To examine growth in liquid medium, yeasts grown to saturation in EMM–Leu medium were subcultured at a starting A600 of 0.1 into the same medium containing different concentrations of CdCl2, and the extent of growth after 48 h was determined by measuring the A600. The growth rate of each culture was also determined by taking A600 readings at multiple intervals throughout the entire 48-h period. To examine growth on plates, cells were grown overnight to saturation in EMM–Leu or S-URA 2% raffinose medium. This overnight culture was diluted in EMM–Leu or S-URA 2% galactose medium to an A600 of 0.4, which in turn was diluted in 10-fold increments. Two microliters of each 10-fold dilution was spotted onto EMM–Leu or S-URA 2% galactose plates containing different concentrations of CdCl2 and incubated for 7 or 3 days at 30 °C. In the case of E. coli, single colonies of bacteria transformed with pUC19 or pUC-SpHMT1-GFP were grown to saturation in LB medium (37 °C, 180 rpm) and were subcultured at a starting A600 of 0.05 into the same medium containing different concentrations of CdCl2. The growth rate of each culture was determined by taking A600 readings at multiple intervals throughout the entire 6-h period. Determination of cadmium content was realized by induced coupled plasma experiments. After centrifugation, pellets were washed three times with 10 mm EDTA, dried for 48 h at 50 °C, and mineralized. The metal content was determined using ICP (ICP-OES Vista-MPX, Varian). Metal resistance assays in the presence of BSO were carried out as described previously (7Prévéral S. Ansoborlo E. Mari S. Vavasseur A. Forestier C. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 1651-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Localization of SpHMT1—The localization of the SpHMT1-EGFP-N2 fusion protein was examined in LK100 S. pombe and in the Y04069 S. cerevisiae transformed strains. After overnight culture, yeast cells (0.8 OD) were resuspended in 1 ml of selective medium with galactose containing 8 μm FM4-64 (Red Synaptracer 3-2 Interchim FP-41109A) After 15 min at 30 °C, cells were centrifuged and washed for 2 h at 30 °C under agitation with 1 ml of selective medium containing galactose. Yeast cells were washed two times in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 1 ml of water before observation on a glass slide. The observations were done with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP2 AOBS) fitted with a krypton/argon laser at ×100 magnification. Excitations were performed at 488 or 568 nm for EGFP-N2 (excitation peak at 488 nm and emission peak at 507 nm) and FM4-64 (excitation peak at 515 nm, emission peak at 640 nm), respectively. The fluorescence was collected through 510–570 and 660–800 nm for EGFP and FM4-64, respectively. The localization of SpHMT1 in bacteria was conducted with log-phase cells expressing GFP-tagged SpHMT1. Cells were examined at 100-fold magnification on a poly-lysine-coated slide by using a Nikon Optiphot-2 fluorescence microscope. The fluorescence was collected through a band-pass filter at 510–570 nm (EGFP-N2 excitation peak at 488 nm, emission peak at 507 nm). Images were captured with a Zeiss AxioCam camera and its dedicated software. Electron Microscopy—Bacteria transformed with pUC19 or pUC-SpHMT1-GFP were fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and extensively washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were infiltrated in a 2% agar gel and embedded in Unicryl. Eighty nm-tick sections were cut, collected on EM grids, preincubated in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% fish gelatin, 0.05% Tween 20 (buffer-T), and followed by a 90-min incubation in the same buffer-T containing a 1:90 dilution of anti-GFP polyclonal antibodies (AbCam antibody ab290). Sections were washed three times in buffer-T and then incubated in a 1:25 dilution of 10-nm gold-conjugated secondary antibodies for 45 min (Amersham Biosciences). After washing in Tris, sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and photographed on a FEI CM12 microscope (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). For statistical analysis, pictures were randomly taken of each of the two samples and of the gold particles located along the plasma membrane, and cytoplasmic background labeling was counted in ∼80 different cells from each sample. Membrane Extraction and Western Blot Analysis—Transformed bacteria were grown in 5 ml of LB ampicillin and subcultured in 1 liter of LB for 4 h at 37 °C. The culture was stopped when the A600 reached 1.5. Bacteria were collected by low speed centrifugation (4000 × g, 15 min at 4 °C). All following steps were carried at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in the buffer 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm leupeptin, 5 μm pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Bacteria were lysed by two successive passages through a French press (18,000 p.s.i.). EDTA was then added at 10 mm. Unbroken bacteria and membrane residues were removed by a 30-min centrifugation at 15,000 × g. Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g and washed in 15 ml of the buffer 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 μm leupeptin, 5 μm pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g. The pellet was finally suspended in 50 mm Tris-MES, pH 8, 300 mm sucrose. Membrane extracts were denaturated at room temperature and subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. After transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, proteins were detected with an anti-GFP antibody (monoclonal antibody JL-8, BD Biosciences; dilution 1:5000) as already described (7Prévéral S. Ansoborlo E. Mari S. Vavasseur A. Forestier C. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 1651-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Periplasmic Extraction—The periplasm extraction was done as already described (24Ames G.F. Prody C. Kustu S. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1181-1183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, bacteria transformed with pUC19 or pUC-SpHMT1-GFP grown to saturation in LB medium supplemented with 100 μm ampicillin were subcultured at a starting A600 of 0.1 into 50 ml of LB with 50 μm cadmium and grown overnight. The culture was stopped when the A600 reached 2.6. Bacteria were collected by low speed centrifugation (4000 × g, 15 min at 4 °C). Pellets were resuspended in 1.5 ml of Tris-HCl, pH 8, by briefly vortexing, and 600 μl of CHCl3 was added. After brief vortexing, the tubes were maintained at room temperature for 15 min, and then 5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, was added. Intact cells were separated by centrifugation (6000 × g, 20 min). The supernatant containing the periplasm was collected, and 1 ml was used to determine the cadmium periplasm content by ICP. Overexpression of SpHMT1 in S. pombe Rescues Cadmium Tolerance in a Sphmt1-deleted Strain—As already reported by Ortiz et al. (13Ortiz D.F. Ruscitti T. Mccue K.F. Ow D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4721-4728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 14Ortiz D.F. Kreppel L. Speiser D.M. Scheel G. Mcdonald G. Ow D.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), an S. pombe mutant having a defect in the Sphmt1 gene and unable to accumulate PC-Cd complexes in the vacuole was found to be cadmium-sensitive. This defect was rescued by expression of the wild-type SpHMT1 protein in the mutant (Fig. 1A). Three independent clones of S. pombe strains expressing a fusion of SpHMT1 with the green fluorescent protein also exhibited an enhanced cadmium tolerance when compared with the Sphmt1 deletion strain (Fig. 1A). Thus, the C-terminal fusion of GFP did not impair the protein function as already observed for other ABC transporters such as HsMRP1 or ScYCF1 (7Prévéral S. Ansoborlo E. Mari S. Vavasseur A. Forestier C. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 1651-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Lee S.H. Altenberg G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 306: 644-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The fusion protein co-localized with the vacuolar marker FM4-64 (Fig. 1B), in accordance with the location of the transporter at the vacuolar membrane previously deduced from membrane fractionation (13Ortiz D.F. Ruscitti T. Mccue K.F. Ow D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4721-4728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). A similar vacuolar location has been observed for CeHMT-1 in S. pombe using a similar GFP fusion strategy (19Vatamaniuk O.K. Bucher E.A. Sundaram M.V. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23684-23690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The protein was detected in Western blots using anti-GFP antibodies at the 112 kDa expected molecular mass (Fig. 1C). We recently reported that ScYCF1 confers a tolerance to other metal(loid)s besides cadmium (7Prévéral S. Ansoborlo E. Mari S. Vavasseur A. Forestier C. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 1651-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, among the metal(loid)s tested, SpHMT1 was able to confer a tolerance to cadmium but not to Sb(III), AgNO3, As(III), As(V), CuSO4, or HgCl2 (supplemental Fig. 1). Overexpression of SpHMT1 Complements Cadmium Tolerance of an S. pombe Strain Devoid of Phytochelatins—To determine whether SpHMT1 is an exclusive PC-Cd transporter, we used the Sp254 S. pombe strain deleted for the PCS gene, Sp27. This strain is unable to synthesize phytochelatins from glutathione and is highly sensitive to cadmium (21Clemens S. Kim E.J. Neumann D. Schroeder J.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3325-3333Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). In this genetic background, overexpression of SpHMT1 was able to completely restore cell tolerance to cadmium in the drop test as well as in liquid media experiments (Fig. 1, D and E). The cadmium resistance was not restored when the Δpcs strain was transformed with the empty vector pART (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that the lack of phytochelatins can be compensated by SpHMT1 overexpression and strongly suggest that SpHMT1 can contribute to cadmium tolerance in S. pombe independently of any phytochelatin synthesis. To confirm this hypothesis, expression of SpHMT1 was investigated in organisms naturally devoid of PC. SpHMT1 Rescues Cadmium Tolerance in the Hypersensitive Δycf1 Strain of S. cerevisiae—In S. cerevisiae, the cadmium detoxification strategy differs from the one reported in S. pombe (5Li Z.S. Lu Y.P. Zhen R.G. Szczypka M. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 13Ortiz D.F. Ruscitti T. Mccue K.F. Ow D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4721-4728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 14Ortiz D.F. Kreppel L. Speiser D.M. Scheel G. Mcdonald G. Ow D.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). There is no PCS gene ortholog in the genome of S. cerevisiae, and cadmium detoxification occurs mainly by the formation of bis(glutathionato)-cadmium complexes in the cytoplasm followed by their transfer into the vacuole by the full-sized ABC transporter ScYCF1 (5Li Z.S. Lu Y.P. Zhen R.G. Szczypka M. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). In accordance, overexpression of ScYCF1 in the S. cerevisiae wild-type context allowed an increase in cadmium tolerance (Fig. 2A). Remarkably, overexpression of SpHMT1 was even more efficient, allowing a yeast cadmium tolerance up to 200 μm. The ability of SpHMT1 to confer cadmium tolerance was even more pronounced in the cadmium-hypersensitive Scycf1 mutant context (Fig. 2A). In this strain, overexpression of SpHMT1 was able to induce a cadmium resistance greater than the one observed after overexpression of the homologous transporter, ScYCF1. A Western blot analysis revealed that the fusion protein SpHMT1-GFP was reproducibly and largely more detected than ScYCF1-GFP based on a similar quantity of proteins loaded on gel (Fig. 2B). This result might argue with the great efficiency of SpHMT1 in cadmium detoxification. In contrast with its location at the vacuolar membrane in S. pombe, in S. cerevisiae, SpHMT1-GFP was located in vesicles surrounding the main vacuole (Fig. 2C). Experiments conducted here, with the two major yeast models that diverged ∼400 million years ago (26Sipiczki M. Genome Biol. 2000; 1: 1-4Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), S. cerevisiae using GSH to complex cadmium and S. pombe using PC, confirm that SpHMT1 activity in cadmium tolerance is independent of PC. Altogether these results demonstrate that SpHMT1 can use another substrate than PC for the cadmium resistance activity. To investigate further possible substrates coming from the thiol pathway, a S. cerevisiae yeast strain depleted of GSH was used. Cadmium Tolerance Conferred by SpHMT1 Depends on Glutathione Synthesis—The comparison of the action mechanism of ScYCF1, the activity of which is strictly coupled to the presence of GSH and of SpHMT1, depending on the presence of PC, lead us to evaluate the hypothesis that GSH might be a candidate as a co-substrate substitute for PC in cadmium transport by SpHMT1. This hypothesis was tested by a direct application in the culture medium of dl-BSO, an inhibitor of γ-glutamyl cysteine synthetase (27Griffith O.W. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7558-7560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, after application of 5 mm BSO, the GSH pool was reduced to 32% of its initial content after 6 h and to 50% after 24 h (7Prévéral S. Ansoborlo E. Mari S. Vavasseur A. Forestier C. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 1651-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the absence of metal, application of 5 mm BSO had no effect on growth of the different yeast strains studied (Fig. 2D). In the presence of 5 mm BSO combined with 50 or 100 μm cadmium, the growth of wild-type strain was diminished by about 30 or 50%, respectively, as already reported (7Prévéral S. Ansoborlo E. Mari S. Vavasseur A. Forestier C. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 1651-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the presence of BSO, the cadmium tolerance of Scycf1 strains expressing ScYCF1-GFP or SpHMT1-GFP was diminished. In contrast, cadmium tolerance resulting from an overexpression of the P1B-ATPase AtHMA4, (the plasma membrane Arabidopsis Cd-ATPase) was unaffected in the presence of BSO (Fig. 2D) (18Verret F. Gravot A. Auroy P. Preveral S. Forestier C. Vavasseur A. Richaud P. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that SpHMT1, similar to ScYCF1, is able to use glutathione as a co-substrate in cadmium transport. SpHMT1 Detoxification Activity Depends on ATP Hydrolysis and Multimerization—The transport activity of ABC transporters is linked to the binding of ATP and its hydrolysis at the level of nucleotide-binding domains(28Hollenstein K. Dawson R.J. Locher K.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 412-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). To ensure that cadmium tolerance conferred by SpHMT1 overexpression was due to a transport activity, a SpHMT1K623M variant of the protein, unable to bind ATP, was produced. Overexpression of this variant did not confer cadmium tolerance to Sphmt1 or Scycf1 deletion strains (Fig. 3A), demonstrating that the binding of ATP by the protein is crucial in the cadmium resistance process. Using Western blot, we confirmed that the SpHMT1K623M variant was properly expressed at a level comparable with the wild-type version of SpHMT1 (Fig. 3B). Moreover, it is interesting to note that SpHMT1K623M had a dominant negative effect when overexpressed in the wild-type S. pombe strain (Fig. 3A). ABC transporters are generally multimeric proteins, and the simplest explanation of this dominant negative effect is that this non-functional polypeptide invalidates the transport activity of the multimeric protein. The fact that both S. cerevisiae and S. pombe yeast cells transformed by the SpHMT1K623M variant plasmid were sensitive to cadmium intoxication strongly suggests that the resistance given by the wild-type SpHMT1 is not due to a chelation process but rather due to an active transport mechanism. SpHMT1 Is Expressed at the Periplasm of E. coli Cells—Because a recent study has shown that a few amounts of PC were synthesized in S. cerevisiae (29Wunschmann J. Beck A. Meyer L. Letzel T. Grill E. Lendzian K.J. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 1681-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), SpHMT1-GFP was also expressed in a prokaryote, E. coli DH10B, fully devoid of PC. Under fluorescence microscopy, only cells transformed with pUC-SpHMT1-GFP were exhibiting a green fluorescent signal (Fig. 4A). Proteins from the soluble and microsomal fractions were extracted, separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and immunodetected with an anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 4B). A 112-kDa apparent polypeptide was detected in the SpHMT1-GFP microsomal fraction that is consistent with the predicted molecular mass of SpHMT1-GFP. A putative dimeric complex was detected at 250 kDa as well as bands at around 65 kDa that could be proteolytic fragments from SpHMT1, as already described in the natural host (13Ortiz D.F. Ruscitti T. Mccue K.F. Ow D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4721-4728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Finally, taking advantage of the C-terminal EGFP tag and 10-nm gold-conjugated secondary antibodies, immunocytolocalization of the transporter was investigated by electronic microscopy in E. coli (Fig. 4C). Although a mean of 1.6 ± 0.4 plasma membrane gold particles per μm2 was observed in 86 independent cells expressing the empty vector, this number was significantly increased to 3.84 ± 0.4 (p = 2.4 10–4) in 78 bacteria expressing pUC-HMT1-GFP. These data demonstrate that in a heterologous system such as E. coli, without any eukaryotic signal peptide, HMT1-GFP can be expressed, preferentially in the periplasmic membrane. SpHMT1 Enhances E. coli Cadmium Tolerance—In DH10B E. coli cells transformed by pUC19, the growth was drastically affected when cadmium concentration was over 25 μm (Fig. 4D). Conversely, overexpression of SpHMT1-GFP induced cell tolerance up to 100 μm cadmium (Fig. 4, D and E). Similar results were obtained using other E. coli strains, DH5 and JC7623 (data not shown). Because E. coli does not naturally produce PC, these results confirm that SpHMT1 can contribute to cadmium tolerance by another way than PC-Cd transport. In yeast, cadmium tolerance conferred by SpHMT1 results from cadmium sequestration into the vacuole. In E. coli, the cadmium content in the periplasmic space of SpHMT1-GFP-overexpressing bacteria was found 3-fold the one in control bacteria (Fig. 4F), suggesting that in E. coli, SpHMT1 conferred cadmium tolerance through cadmium sequestration into the periplasmic space. Analysis by exclusion chromatography of cadmium complexes in periplasmic spaces of pUC SpHMT1-GFP-transformed bacteria and pUC19-transformed bacteria revealed a similar profile, the only difference being a higher level of the different complexes in SpHMT1-GFP-expressing bacteria. GSH-Cd complexes were resolved but did not form the major cadmium ligand. In the two genetic backgrounds, the majority of cadmium was associated to a large peak revealing a high molecular mass complex (7 kDa), the nature of which was not resolved. Conclusion—We have shown that SpHMT1 is able to rescue the cadmium-sensitive phenotype of an S. pombe mutant deficient for the PCS gene, suggesting that PC-Cd is not the only substrate of SpHMT1. When heterogously overexpressed in the Scycf1 deletion mutant of S. cerevisiae, which is cadmium-hypersensitive and devoid of PCS, SpHMT1 also allowed recovery of a wild-type phenotype. The complementation of the Scycf1 strain was found BSO-sensitive, suggesting that cadmium conjugated to glutathione is a substrate of SpHMT1. Overexpression of a SpHMT1K623M variant exhibiting a point mutation in the nucleotide-binding domain led to a suppression of the cadmium tolerance, disclosing a possible cadmium chelation by the overexpressed protein. This mutated form had a dominant negative effect, suggesting that SpHMT1 functions as a multimeric protein. Because S. cerevisiae has been shown to synthesize a few amounts of phytochelatins (29Wunschmann J. Beck A. Meyer L. Letzel T. Grill E. Lendzian K.J. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 1681-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), SpHMT1 was also ovexpressed in E. coli. Even in the context of this prokaryote, fully devoid of PC, SpHMT1 was able to confer a strong tolerance to cadmium, accompanied by a different partitioning of cadmium in the bacteria. These results demonstrate that SpHMT1 is not an exclusive PC-Cd transporter but that it can likely take in charge cadmium-glutathione conjugates. This gives an explanation for the stronger phenotype of the CeHMT-1-deficient mutant when compared with the CePCS1-deficient mutant under cadmium stress. The absence of phytochelatin would notably affect free cadmium chelation in the cytoplasm, thus conferring cadmium sensitivity. Invalidation of CeHMT-1 has a higher impact on cadmium resistance through the invalidation of cadmium sequestration in the vacuole. Thus, invalidation of this transporter results in critical levels of cadmium in the cytoplasm, leading to a strong toxicity. Altogether these results demonstrate that SpHMT1 is a polyvalent transporter that can take in charge different forms of cadmium complexes, as illustrated on Fig. 5. It is the first study showing that an ABC transporter (HMT1) can accommodate glutathione, as well as phytochelatin-cadmium complexes. This information would help identify the transporter in charge of cadmium detoxification in plants, a protein that has long been sought after by different groups for many years based on its ability to use phytochelatin-cadmium complexes. Our results challenge the dogma of the two separate cadmium detoxification pathways and demonstrate that a common highly conserved cadmium detoxification mechanism has been selected during the evolution from bacteria, including plants and yeast, to humans. Moreover, besides the fact that cadmium is implicated in cancer in humans (in liver and kidney), the nature of the human transporter responsible for cadmium detoxification remains an open question. Our results would lead to building new models of heavy metal detoxification to prevent/cure diseases linked to the exposition of humans to this toxin. We thank D. Ortiz and S.

The vertebrate nuclear receptor PPARα 2The abbreviations used are: PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; OA, oleic acid; LA, lauric acid; MA, myristic acid; SA, stearic acid; PA, palmitic acid; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR. 2The abbreviations used are: PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; NSAID, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; OA, oleic acid; LA, lauric acid; MA, myristic acid; SA, stearic acid; PA, palmitic acid; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR. activates transcription of genes involved in fatty acid β-oxidation in response to binding to certain fatty acids and their metabolites, as well as peroxisome proliferators, a class of hypolipidemic chemicals, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (1Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar, 2Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3037) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the yeast zinc cluster transcription factor Oaf1p (together with its heterodimer partner Pip2p) was discovered as a fatty acid-activated transcriptional regulator of a number of peroxisomal and β-oxidation genes, many of which are homologous to PPARα-activated genes (1Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar, 3Hiltunen J.K. Mursula A.M. Rottensteiner H. Wierenga R.K. Kastaniotis A.J. Gurvitz A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 35-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Importantly, a recent study demonstrated that Oaf1p could directly bind to the fatty acid oleic acid to regulate transcription of target genes; this functional behavior is thus strikingly similar to vertebrate PPARα and raised the question of whether these metazoan and fungal ligand-dependent transcription factor families are evolutionarily related (4Phelps C. Gburcik V. Suslova E. Dudek P. Forafonov F. Bot N. MacLean M. Fagan R.J. Picard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7077-7081Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Additional comparisons of Oaf1p and PPARs functional characteristics, such as ligand binding specificities and transcription co-activator requirements, might shed further light on the possibility of an evolutionary relationship. Vertebrate nuclear receptors, including PPARs, stimulate expression of target genes by recruiting different classes of transcription co-activators, including Mediator, a large co-activator complex conserved from yeast to human (5Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that orthologs of the Pdr1p zinc cluster family member in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida glabrata require the Mediator subunit Gal11p/MED15 for xenobiotic-dependent transactivation of multidrug resistance genes (6Thakur J.K. Arthanari H. Yang F. Pan S.J. Fan X. Breger J. Frueh D.P. Gulshan K. Li D.K. Mylonakis E. Struhl K. Moye-Rowley W.S. Cormack B.P. Wagner G. Näär A.M. Nature. 2008; 452: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This work also revealed that Gal11p/MED15 harbors an activator-targeted domain with marked structural and functional similarity to the KIX domain present in the metazoan ARC105/MED15 Mediator subunit and the CREB-binding protein/p300 acetyl-transferases (6Thakur J.K. Arthanari H. Yang F. Pan S.J. Fan X. Breger J. Frueh D.P. Gulshan K. Li D.K. Mylonakis E. Struhl K. Moye-Rowley W.S. Cormack B.P. Wagner G. Näär A.M.

The activation domain of Pdr1p orthologs interacts with the Gal11p/MED15 KIX domain in a xenobiotic-stimulated manner and Gal11p/MED15 KIX is essential for xenobiotic-dependent activation of the multidrug resistance program in S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata. In contrast with the detailed understanding of the transactivation mechanism by Pdr1p orthologs, the molecular requirements for gene activation, including a potential role for Gal11p/MED15 and its KIX domain, by other ligand-stimulated fungal zinc cluster transcription factors, such as Oaf1p, remain unclear. Here we show that Oaf1p binds directly to a number of fatty acids (including oleic acid, palmitic acid, myristic acid, and lauric acid), resulting in gene activation. Interestingly, Oaf1p also interacts with peroxisome proliferators/NSAIDs, albeit in a non-productive manner. These findings suggest that Oaf1p shares several functional attributes with PPARα; however, important mechanistic differences do exist. We also establish here that the Gal11p/MED15 Mediator subunit and its KIX domain are critical mediators of fatty acid- and Oaf1p-dependent transactivation and important for yeast growth on oleic acid as carbon source. Together with the finding by others that gene activation by the Caenorhabditis elegans PPARα-like nuclear receptor NHR-49 requires the Gal11p/MED15 homolog MDT-15 (9Taubert S. Van Gilst M.R. Hansen M. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1137-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), these studies suggest that targeting of the Gal11p/MED15 KIX domain is a conserved transactivation mechanism shared by members of the fungal ligand-dependent zinc cluster transcription factor family and metazoan nuclear receptors. Strains, Plasmids, and Oligonucleotides—The Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for all the plasmid manipulations, amplifications, subcloning and isolations. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table 1, and the plasmids and oligonucleotides are listed in supplemental Table 2. For the construction of pADH2-FLAG-Gal4pDBD-Oaf1pC, FLAG-Gal4pDBD was amplified by PCR from pcDNA3-HA-Gal4pDBD using the oligonucleotide pair XFG4 (5′-GCTCTAGAGACTACAAAGACGACGATGACAAGCTACTGTCTTC-3′), which contained FLAG sequence, and KG4 (5′-GGGGTACCCCGTAACAATGCTTTTATATC-3′). The resulting 330-bp XbaI-KpnI fragment was used to replace the 900-bp XbaI-KpnI fragment in pADH2-Oaf1p-Myc9 (10Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Tabak H.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To generate pGBKT7-Oaf1p, the 3.2-kb OAF1 open reading frame was amplified by PCR using pADH2-Oaf1p-Myc9 as template (10Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Tabak H.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The primers used were 5′-CTCGCCGTCGACTATCTAGAGTCGAAAATAGTACGCAG-3′ and 5′-CTCGCTCAAGCTTGCGGCCGCTTAAGCAAAGTCATTGCC-3′. The amplified fragment was digested with SalI and HindIII and ligated into appropriately cut pGBKT7. Strains overexpressing FLAG-Gal4pDBD-Oaf1pC were generated by integration of EcoRV-linearized pADH2-FLAG-Gal4pDBD-Oaf1pC into the trp1 locus of the YF120 strain. The resulting strain was obtained by selecting transformants on -Trp selective media. Yeast Media and Growth Conditions—For β-galactosidase assays, overnight cultures propagated in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, and 2% glucose) were diluted to an A600 of 0.3 in YP (1% yeast extract and 2% bactopeptone) supplemented with different concentrations of various fatty acids or chemicals as indicated and grown for another 16–20 h. Cultures were grown at 30 °C with vigorous aeration. For growth assay on oleic acid and YPD plates, cells cultured overnight were diluted to A600 of 0.5, and then four serial dilutions of 1/10 times were spotted on YPO (1% yeast extract, 2% bactopeptone, 0.2% oleic acid, and 0.02% Tween 80). Ligand Binding Assay—The FLAG-tagged Oaf1p C-terminal domain (amino acids 181–1047) fused to the Gal4p DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–94) was expressed in YF120. Yeast extract was prepared from 6 liters of culture at mid-log phase and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG-Sepharose beads (M2, Sigma). The beads were used for ligand binding assays as described previously (6Thakur J.K. Arthanari H. Yang F. Pan S.J. Fan X. Breger J. Frueh D.P. Gulshan K. Li D.K. Mylonakis E. Struhl K. Moye-Rowley W.S. Cormack B.P. Wagner G. Näär A.M. Nature. 2008; 452: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), with anti-FLAG-Sepharose beads as control to determine nonspecific binding. Briefly, 20 μl of beads were incubated with the specified amount of 14C-labeled oleic acid (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 5 h at 4 °C in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)). The beads were washed four times with binding buffer followed by scintillation counting. For competition assays, 100-fold molar excess cold fatty acids or peroxisome proliferators/NSAIDs were added to the initial binding solution. Immunopurification and Immunoblotting—Immunopurification and immunoblotting were carried out by standard procedures as described (6Thakur J.K. Arthanari H. Yang F. Pan S.J. Fan X. Breger J. Frueh D.P. Gulshan K. Li D.K. Mylonakis E. Struhl K. Moye-Rowley W.S. Cormack B.P. Wagner G. Näär A.M. Nature. 2008; 452: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The antibodies used were: anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-hemagglutinin (HA) (Covance Research Products), and anti-Myc (antibody sc-40, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). GST Pulldown Assays—GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described (6Thakur J.K. Arthanari H. Yang F. Pan S.J. Fan X. Breger J. Frueh D.P. Gulshan K. Li D.K. Mylonakis E. Struhl K. Moye-Rowley W.S. Cormack B.P. Wagner G. Näär A.M. Nature. 2008; 452: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Yeast whole cell extracts were prepared as described (6Thakur J.K. Arthanari H. Yang F. Pan S.J. Fan X. Breger J. Frueh D.P. Gulshan K. Li D.K. Mylonakis E. Struhl K. Moye-Rowley W.S. Cormack B.P. Wagner G. Näär A.M. Nature. 2008; 452: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and GST pulldowns were carried out as described (6Thakur J.K. Arthanari H. Yang F. Pan S.J. Fan X. Breger J. Frueh D.P. Gulshan K. Li D.K. Mylonakis E. Struhl K. Moye-Rowley W.S. Cormack B.P. Wagner G. Näär A.M. Nature. 2008; 452: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In vitro translated proteins (3 ml) were diluted 100-fold with the binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). A total of 1 ml of yeast whole cell extracts or diluted in vitro translated proteins was applied to 20 μl of GST fusion protein beads and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. Beads were washed five times with 1 ml each of binding buffer containing 250 mm KCl and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The interacting proteins were then eluted with 0.3% sarkosyl in binding buffer at 4 °C for 1 h. NMR Experiments—15N, 15N-13C, and 15N-13C-2H (perdeuterated) labeled samples of yeast Gal11p/MED15 KIX (amino acids 6–90) were expressed and purified as described earlier (6Thakur J.K. Arthanari H. Yang F. Pan S.J. Fan X. Breger J. Frueh D.P. Gulshan K. Li D.K. Mylonakis E. Struhl K. Moye-Rowley W.S. Cormack B.P. Wagner G. Näär A.M. Nature. 2008; 452: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Oaf1pAD-9 (LFDYDFLFG) was purchased as a synthetic peptide from the Tufts New England Medical Center peptide synthesis facility, Boston, MA. Titrations of Gal11p/MED15 KIX with the Oaf1pAD-9 were carried out in a “high phosphate buffer” (50 mm Na2HPO4, 50 mm NaH2PO4, 2 mm K2HPO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.01% NaN3) to maintain the pH during the course of the titration. The bound conformation of Gal11p/MED15 KIX was assigned by standard triple resonance backbone experiments (HNCA and HNCACB) (11Ferentz A.E. Wagner G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 29-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Cross saturation transfer experiments were carried out using a perdeuterated sample of Gal11p/MED15 KIX and unlabeled Oaf1pAD-9. The methyl region of the Oaf1p peptide (i.e. 1 ppm) was excited with a WURST pulse (3 ppm of bandwidth) for the duration of 2 s followed by a standard HSQC experiment (12Takahashi H. Nakanishi T. Kami K. Arata Y. Shimada I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2000; 7: 220-223Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The experiment was carried out in an interleaved fashion with irradiation and no irradiation in successive scans. The ratio of intensities between the saturated HSQC and the nonsaturated HSQC was later analyzed. 15N-dispersed NOE spectroscopy experiments with a mixing time of 0.2 s were carried out on a perdeuterated sample of 15N-13C-enriched Gal11p/MED15 KIX and unlabeled Oaf1pAD-9 in the molar ratio 1:1 to obtain intermolecular NOEs. Miscellaneous—The following procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions: yeast RNA preparation (Qiagen), RT-PCR analysis (Amersham Biosciences), and in vitro protein synthesis (Promega). Yeast transformation and enzyme assay for β-galactosidase activity were performed according to standard protocols. Oaf1p Binds Directly to Both Fatty Acids and Peroxisome Proliferators/NSAIDs—Oaf1p directly interacts with oleic acid (OA) to transactivate fatty acid β-oxidation and peroxisomal genes, and OA causes peroxisome proliferation in yeast in an Oaf1p-dependent manner (10Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Tabak H.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 13Karpichev I.V. Luo Y. Marians R.C. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 69-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting intriguing functional similarities with vertebrate PPARα. We set out to determine whether peroxisome proliferators and NSAIDs might also interact with Oaf1p and affect Oaf1p transcriptional activity. We first tested whether fatty acids and peroxisome proliferators/NSAIDs interact with a C-terminal fragment of Oaf1p harboring the fatty acid-binding domain (4Phelps C. Gburcik V. Suslova E. Dudek P. Forafonov F. Bot N. MacLean M. Fagan R.J. Picard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7077-7081Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged Oaf1pC fused to the Gal4p DNA-binding domain expressed in yeast bound to radiolabeled OA (Fig. 1A), consistent with previous observations (4Phelps C. Gburcik V. Suslova E. Dudek P. Forafonov F. Bot N. MacLean M. Fagan R.J. Picard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7077-7081Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained with immunopurified, full-length, Myc-tagged Oaf1p translated in vitro, whereas several other control proteins did not significantly bind to radiolabeled OA (data not shown). Competition experiments with 100-fold excess of unlabeled fatty acids and peroxisome proliferators/NSAIDs revealed that all compounds, with the exception of stearic acid, bound strongly to immunopurified FLAG-Gal4p-Oaf1pC and full-length Myc-Oaf1p (Fig. 1B and data not shown). We next examined transactivation by Gal4p-Oaf1pC of an integrated GAL7 promoter-LacZ reporter in yeast in response to different fatty acids and peroxisome proliferators/NSAIDs. Gal4p-Oaf1pC activated the reporter strongly in response to OA, in keeping with a previous report demonstrating that the C-terminal domain of Oaf1p fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain could confer OA inducibility (Fig. 1C) (14Baumgartner U. Hamilton B. Piskacek M. Ruis H. Rottensteiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22208-22216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Similar to the broad ligand specificity of PPARα, Gal4p-Oaf1pC was also potently activated by several other fatty acids tested, including lauric acid (LA), myristic acid (MA), and palmitic acid (PA), whereas stearic acid (SA), which does not effectively bind to Oaf1p, was unable to activate Gal4p-Oaf1pC (Fig. 1C). This suggests that several fatty acids with different carbon chain lengths activate Oaf1p by direct binding to the C-terminal ligand-binding domain (Fig. 1B). Surprisingly, however, the peroxisome proliferators/NSAIDs fenofibrate (Fig. 1B, FF), clofibrate (Fig. 1B, CF), and fenoprofen (Fig. 1B, FP), which compete effectively for [14C]OA binding to Oaf1p (Fig. 1B), alone acted as very weak agonists of Gal4p-Oaf1pC and full-length Myc-Oaf1p (Fig. 1C and data not shown). Moreover, when peroxisome proliferators/NSAIDs were present in 10-fold molar excess, OA was no longer capable of stimulating transcription through Gal4p-Oaf1pC, suggesting that these drugs act as potent competitive antagonists for OA-dependent activation by Oaf1p (Fig. 1D). By contrast, SA, which does not bind to FLAG-Gal4p-Oaf1pC or Myc-Oaf1p, did not affect OA-induced Gal4p-Oaf1pC activation (Fig. 1D and data not shown). These findings demonstrate that although peroxisome proliferators/NSAIDs (which are potent agonists of PPARα) can interact directly and strongly with yeast Oaf1p, they are unable to fully activate Oaf1p, and indeed, function as antagonists of fatty acid-induced transcription. Gal11p/MED15 Is Required for Oaf1p-dependent Transactivation and Yeast Growth on Oleic Acid—The Mediator co-activator complex is conserved from yeast to human and plays a critical role in ligand-dependent gene activation both by members of the fungal zinc cluster transcription factor family and by members of the metazoan nuclear receptor family (6Thakur J.K. Arthanari H. Yang F. Pan S.J. Fan X. Breger J. Frueh D.P. Gulshan K. Li D.K. Mylonakis E. Struhl K. Moye-Rowley W.S. Cormack B.P. Wagner G. Näär A.M. Nature. 2008; 452: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 15Kornberg R.D. Trends Biochem.

Sci. 2005; 30: 256-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). We have examined here the functional requirement for Mediator subunits in fatty acid-regulated and Oaf1p-dependent activation of peroxisomal and fatty acid β-oxidation genes and in the ability of yeast to utilize fatty acids as the sole carbon source. Although deletion of most Mediator subunits caused little or modest effects on yeast growth on OA plates, a strain deleted for Gal11p/MED15 was deficient for growth on OA as carbon source, similar to the strain harboring a deletion of the gene encoding Oaf1p (Fig. 2A) (10Rottensteiner H. Kal A.J. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Tabak H.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 13Karpichev I.V. Luo Y. Marians R.C. Small G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 69-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PGD1/MED3 deletion strain also exhibited a somewhat reduced capacity to grow on OA (Fig. 2A), consistent with the notion that the Pgd1p/MED3 subunit (also known as Hrs1p) is a part of the Gal11p/MED15 tail module of Mediator (17Björklund S. Gustafsson C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 240-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 18Lee Y.C. Park J.M. Min S. Han S.J. Kim Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2967-2976Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). None of the deletions affected growth on rich medium with glucose as carbon source (YPD) (Fig. 2A). Our results thus suggest that the activator-targeted Gal11p/MED15 Mediator subunit is required for the ability of yeast to utilize fatty acids as carbon source and that Gal11p/MED15 could play an important role in Oaf1p- and fatty acid-dependent activation of genes in the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway. We therefore examined the requirement for Gal11p/MED15 in fatty acid-dependent transactivation of FOX2 and FOX3 (3Hiltunen J.K. Mursula A.M. Rottensteiner H. Wierenga R.K. Kastaniotis A.J. Gurvitz A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 35-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), two well characterized Oaf1p target genes encoding peroxisomal enzymes required for fatty acid β-oxidation. Indeed, deletion of the gene encoding Gal11p/MED15 resulted in complete loss of oleic acid-stimulated transcription of both FOX2 and FOX3, similar to results with the OAF1 deletion strain, whereas deletion of MED1 and several other Mediator subunits had no significant effect on the expression of Oaf1p target genes in response to oleic acid (Fig. 2B and data not shown). These results indicate that the Gal11p/MED15 Mediator subunit is specifically and critically involved in Oaf1p- and oleic acid-dependent transactivation of fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes. The Oaf1p Activation Domain Interacts with the KIX Domain of Gal11p/MED15—We have recently shown that the N terminus of yeast Gal11p/MED15 harbors a structurally conserved KIX domain that interacts with Pdr1p orthologs in fungi and is required for xenobiotic-dependent gene activation by Pdr1p orthologs (6Thakur J.K. Arthanari H. Yang F. Pan S.J. Fan X. Breger J. Frueh D.P. Gulshan K. Li D.K. Mylonakis E. Struhl K. Moye-Rowley W.S. Cormack B.P. Wagner G. Näär A.M.

Based on the functional requirement for Gal11p/MED15 in Oaf1p gene activation, we examined whether the Gal11p/MED15 KIX domain could serve as a target of Oaf1p. Indeed, both full-length Oaf1p and Gal4p-Oaf1pC bound to the Gal11p/MED15 KIX domain fused to GST in an OA-stimulated manner but not to GST alone (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Fatty acids that activate Oaf1p (OA, MA, LA, and PA) all enhance the interaction between the Gal11p/MED15 KIX domain and 35S-labeled, in vitro synthesized, full-length Oaf1p, whereas SA, which does not bind to nor activate Oaf1p, did not stimulate Oaf1p interaction with the Gal11p/MED15 KIX domain (Fig. 3A). Importantly, although they are capable of binding to Oaf1p, peroxisome proliferators/NSAIDs were also unable to enhance the interaction between the Gal11p/MED15 KIX domain and Oaf1p (Fig. 3A), suggesting that their association with Oaf1p does not result in a proper conformational change allowing interaction between Oaf1p and its cognate co-activator. Oaf1p contains a short activation domain in its distal C terminus (14Baumgartner U. Hamilton B. Piskacek M. Ruis H. Rottensteiner H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22208-22216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Piskacek S. Gregor M. Nemethova M. Grabner M. Kovarik P. Piskacek M. Genomics. 2007; 89: 756-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and we have investigated whether a fragment of Oaf1p containing the activation domain could bind to the Gal11p/MED15 KIX domain. Indeed, we find that the Oaf1p activation domain fragment alone bound effectively to GST-Gal11p/MED15 KIX but not to GST alone (data not shown). We have recently used NMR spectroscopy to determine the solution structure of the Gal11p/MED15 KIX domain and performed detailed characterization of the Pdr1p-binding site on the KIX domain (6Thakur J.K. Arthanari H. Yang F. Pan S.J. Fan X. Breger J. Frueh D.P. Gulshan K. Li D.K. Mylonakis E. Struhl K. Moye-Rowley W.S. Cormack B.P. Wagner G. Näär A.M. Nature. 2008; 452: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To further investigate the mechanistic similarities and differences of Oaf1p and Pdr1p, we have initially employed NMR to study the interaction of a 9-amino acid Oaf1p activation domain peptide (Oaf1pAD-9) with the Gal11p/MED15 KIX domain (19Piskacek S.

Gal11p/MED15 KIX forms a tight three-helix bundle packing around an extensively hydrophobic core (6Thakur J.K. Arthanari H. Yang F. Pan S.J. Fan X. Breger J. Frueh D.P. Gulshan K. Li D.K.

Nakanishi T. Kami K. Arata Y. Shimada I. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2000; 7: 220-223Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar), where the resonances of the peptide are selectively saturated and amide protons of the KIX domain are monitored for saturation transfer, show that Oaf1pAD-9 binding occurs at the interface between the three helices with strong interactions with helix 2 (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. S1). Direct NOE contacts are observed to the amide protons of residues 48–50, 52, 53, and 58, all of which are located in helix 2 (Fig. 3, F and G and supplemental Fig. S1). The binding mode of Oaf1pAD-9, including extensive contacts with the residues that together constitute the hydrophobic core of Gal11p/MED15 KIX, parallels that of Pdr1p (Fig. 3, C and D, and supplemental Fig. S1) (6Thakur J.K. Arthanari H. Yang F. Pan S.J. Fan X. Breger J. Frueh D.P. Gulshan K. Li D.K. Mylonakis E. Struhl K. Moye-Rowley W.S. Cormack B.P. Wagner G. Näär A.M. Nature. 2008; 452: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Both activators harbor hydrophobic residues in their C-terminal tails, which yield favorable van der Waals interactions with the Gal11p/MED15 KIX domain. Together, these findings indicate that the Gal11p/MED15 Mediator subunit is an essential target and transducer of fatty acid-regulated and Oaf1p-dependent transactivation of peroxisomal target genes. Moreover, the KIX domain in Gal11p/MED15 appears to be sufficient for binding to Oaf1p and its activation domain. Furthermore, our findings suggest that binding of peroxisome proliferators cannot relieve intramolecular inhibitory contacts that prevent the Oaf1p activation domain from interacting with the Gal11p/MED15 KIX domain, explaining why these drugs are incapable of effectively inducing transcription of Oaf1p target genes. The Gal11p/MED15 KIX Domain Is Required for Oleic Acid-dependent Transactivation by Oaf1p—Following up the observation that the Gal11p/MED15 KIX domain interacts with the Oaf1p activation domain in vitro, we investigated the functional role of Gal11p/MED15 KIX in oleic acid-induced transcription of Oaf1p target genes in vivo. A gal11/med15Δ strain was transformed with plasmids harboring either the full-length wild-type GAL11/MED15 cDNA (Gal11pFL) or a variant of GAL11/MED15 lacking the sequences coding for the KIX domain (Gal11pΔKIX) (6Thakur J.K. Arthanari H. Yang F. Pan S.J. Fan X. Breger J. Frueh D.P. Gulshan K. Li D.K. Mylonakis E. Struhl K. Moye-Rowley W.S. Cormack B.P. Wagner G. Näär A.M. Nature. 2008; 452: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In yeast cells lacking endogenous Gal11p/MED15, ectopic expression of Gal11p/MED15 deleted for the KIX domain could not rescue oleic acid-induced expression of the Oaf1p target genes FOX2 and FOX3, whereas expression of full-length Gal11p/MED15 complemented Gal11p/MED15 loss, as expected (Fig. 4A and data not shown). To further determine the functional significance of the Gal11p/MED15 KIX domain in fatty acid metabolism in yeast, we cultured the Gal11pFL and Gal11pΔKIX strains on oleic acid as the sole carbon source. Yeast cells expressing KIX-deleted Gal11p/MED15 grew poorly on oleic acid, similar to the gal11/med15Δ parental strain, whereas full-length Gal11p/MED15 was able to fully rescue the gal11/med15Δ growth phenotype on oleic acid (Fig. 4B). These results together indicate that the Oaf1p-binding KIX domain of Gal11p/MED15 is essential for Oaf1p- and oleic acid-dependent transactivation of peroxisomal genes coding for fatty acid β-oxidation enzymes, as well as Oaf1p-dependent growth of yeast cells with oleic acid as a sole carbon source. Metazoan nuclear receptors represent a large family of ligand-regulated transcription factors that respond to diverse lipophilic ligands, including steroid hormones and dietary derivatives such as fatty acids, vitamin D3, retinoids, as well as xenobiotics (20Handschin C.

The evolutionary origin of metazoan nuclear receptors has been obscure, although bioinformatics studies have suggested that the ancestor emerged in an ur-metazoan subsequent to the split of animals from fungi and plants (23Bertrand S.

Recent findings by others and us have suggested that members of the fungal zinc cluster transcription factor family behave in a manner functionally analogous to metazoan nuclear receptors, raising the question of whether these small molecule-regulated transcription factor families are evolutionarily related (4Phelps C. Gburcik V. Suslova E. Dudek P. Forafonov F. Bot N. MacLean M. Fagan R.J. Picard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7077-7081Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 6Thakur J.K.

Nature. 2008; 452: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Indeed, Oaf1p, a zinc cluster family member first discovered as a transcription regulator of peroxisomal and fatty acid β-oxidation genes in response to fatty acids, was shown to directly bind to the fatty acid oleic acid (4Phelps C. Gburcik V. Suslova E. Dudek P. Forafonov F. Bot N. MacLean M. Fagan R.J. Picard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7077-7081Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10Rottensteiner H.

Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar). PPARα is additionally activated by synthetic chemicals referred to as peroxisome proliferators, including fibrates, as well as NSAIDs, such as fenoprofen and indomethacin, and several studies have shown that PPARα binds directly to these compounds (1Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2727) Google Scholar, 2Issemann I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3037) Google Scholar, 22Kliewer S.A.

MacLean M. Fagan R.J. Picard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7077-7081Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) where they showed direct binding of oleic acid to Oaf1p, we have here demonstrated that Oaf1p also binds directly to several other fatty acids (such as myristic acid, palmitic acid, and lauric acid), as well as peroxisome proliferators and NSAIDs such as clofibrate, fenofibrate, and fenoprofen. These new findings suggest further mechanistic similarities of yeast Oaf1p and vertebrate PPARα. Interestingly, although peroxisome proliferators/NSAIDs can bind to Oaf1p, they are by contrast with fatty acids unable to promote effective Oaf1p-dependent gene activation. Instead, these compounds compete with fatty acids for the same ligand-binding site in Oaf1p and act as potent antagonists of fatty acid-dependent gene activation. Thus, although Oaf1p and PPARα exhibit extensive functional similarities, there are apparent differences in their responses to specific ligands. Ligand binding to nuclear receptors results in conformational alterations that liberate the C-terminal activation domain from intramolecular inhibitory contacts, allowing binding of the activation domain to co-activators (5Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thus speculate that binding of fatty acids, but not peroxisome proliferators/NSAIDs, to Oaf1p may also cause a functionally productive conformational change in Oaf1p. It will be interesting to investigate the resultant structural differences in Oaf1p after binding to different ligands such as fatty acids and peroxisome proliferators/NSAIDs. Together with the striking functional similarities discussed above and the fact that Oaf1p and PPARα regulate many homologous genes, our findings support the hypothesis that these families of ligand-regulated transactivators may share a common ancestor. Recently, we demonstrated that Pdr1p, another zinc cluster transcription factor, regulates expression of genes constituting the multidrug resistance network in S. cerevisiae and C. glabrata in response to direct binding of diverse xenobiotics, and thus, is functionally analogous to the vertebrate xenobiotic nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR) (6Thakur J.K. Arthanari H. Yang F. Pan S.J. Fan X. Breger J. Frueh D.P. Gulshan K. Li D.K. Mylonakis E. Struhl K. Moye-Rowley W.S. Cormack B.P. Wagner G. Näär A.M.

These results provide further support for the notion that these fungal and metazoan ligand-regulated transcription factor families might be evolutionarily related. However, despite the compelling structural and functional similarities between Oaf1p and PPARα, we cannot exclude the possibility of convergent evolution. Additional studies of possible functional analogy of other nuclear receptors and yeast zinc cluster family members should further clarify the issue of evolutionary divergence versus convergence of these families of eukaryotic ligand-responsive transcription factors. Mammalian nuclear receptors, including PPARs, have been found to interact with co-activators containing the LXXLL motif, such as the p160 family and the TRAP220/MED1 Mediator subunit (5Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Malik S. Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem.

The yeast MED1 subunit, however, does not contain an LXXLL motif and is not required for fatty acid-activated transcription by the yeast PPARα analog Oaf1p or for growth on oleic acid as a sole carbon source. We find that Oaf1p instead functionally requires a distinct Mediator subunit, Gal11p/MED15, and interacts with its conserved KIX domain. Moreover, activating fatty acids such as OA, MA, PA, and LA enhance the interaction between Oaf1p and the Gal11p/MED15 KIX domain, whereas poorly binding fatty acids (e.g. SA) do not. Although peroxisome proliferators and NSAIDs do bind strongly to Oaf1p, they do not stimulate interaction between the Oaf1p activation domain and the Gal11p/MED15 KIX domain, explaining the inability of these compounds to induce transcription of Oaf1p target genes. The reliance of Oaf1p on the Gal11p/MED15 Mediator subunit for transactivation would seem to indicate that the gene activation mechanism of Oaf1p is dissimilar to that of nuclear receptors. Interestingly, however, a recent study showed that the Gal11p/MED15 homolog in C. elegans (MDT-15) can serve as a target of NHR-49, a C. elegans orphan nuclear receptor that regulates genes involved in fatty acid and glucose homeostasis and that has been suggested to be functionally similar to vertebrate PPARα (supplemental Fig. S2) (9Taubert S. Van Gilst M.R. Hansen M. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1137-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Moreover, sequences containing the predicted KIX domain in MDT-15 were sufficient for interaction with NHR-49 (9Taubert S. Van Gilst M.R. Hansen M. Yamamoto K.R. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1137-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Hence, the mechanistic similarity of C. elegans NHR-49 and yeast Oaf1p lend further credence to the notion that at least a subset of metazoan nuclear receptors that are functionally related to PPARα may indeed share a common evolutionary origin with Oaf1p (supplemental Fig. S2). Fungal Pdr1p orthologs, which are functionally analogous to metazoan PXR, also require Gal11p/MED15 Mediator subunits and their KIX domains for expression of multidrug resistance genes (6Thakur J.K. Arthanari H. Yang F. Pan S.J. Fan X. Breger J. Frueh D.P. Gulshan K. Li D.K. Mylonakis E. Struhl K. Moye-Rowley W.S. Cormack B.P. Wagner G. Näär A.M. Nature. 2008; 452: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study indicated that MDT-15 might also play a role in detoxification/multidrug resistance in C. elegans (33Taubert S. Hansen M. Van Gilst M.R. Cooper S.B. Yamamoto K.R. PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000021Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These findings together suggest that Gal11p/MED15 orthologs may represent primordial targets and conserved mediators of nuclear receptor-like transcription factors in eukaryotes.

Understanding the origin of thymic adipocytes and mechanisms responsible for age-related thymic adiposity is thus germane for the design of long lasting thymic rejuvenation strategies. We have recently identified that ghrelin, an orexigenic anti-inflammatory peptide, can partially reverse age-related thymic involution. Here we demonstrate that Ghrl and ghrelin receptor (growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR)) are expressed in thymic stromal cells and that their expression declines with physiological aging. Genetic ablation of ghrelin and GHSR leads to loss of thymic epithelial cells (TEC) and an increase in adipogenic fibroblasts in the thymus, suggesting potential cellular transitions. Using FoxN1Cre;R26RstopLacZ double transgenic mice, we provide qualitative evidence that thymic epithelial cells can transition to mesenchymal cells that express proadipogenic regulators in the thymus. We found that loss of functional Ghrl-GHSR interactions facilitates EMT and induces thymic adipogenesis with age. In addition, the compromised thymic stromal microenvironment due to lack of Ghrl-GHSR interactions is associated with reduced number of naive T cells. These data suggest that Ghrl may be a novel regulator of EMT and preserves thymic stromal cell microenvironment by controlling age-related adipocyte development within the thymus.

These data suggest that Ghrl may be a novel regulator of EMT and preserves thymic stromal cell microenvironment by controlling age-related adipocyte development within the thymus. The specialized three-dimensional thymic meshwork is composed of cortex and medulla, which is mainly comprised of distinct developing T cell subsets and diverse specialized thymic stromal cell populations (1Rodewald H.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26: 355-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). At birth, the thymocytes are the predominant cell types in the thymus; however, by the fifth decade of life in healthy humans, greater than 80% of thymic microenvironment is composed of lipid-laden adipocytes (2Steinmann G.G. Curr. Top. Pathol. 1986; 75: 43-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). The raison d’être of thymus is to produce naive T cells and establish the T cell arm of immunity, whereas the function of adipocytes is to regulate energy homeostasis (3Dixit V.D. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2008; 84: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Therefore, the development of adipocytes within a small lymphoid organ like the thymus is puzzling given its unlikely impact on overall energy homeostasis. Nonetheless, considering that the aged thymus is almost entirely replaced with adipocytes, the reconstitution strategies for thymic function in the elderly may be limited by the presence of terminally differentiated adipocytes in thymic space.Given that the thymus lacks a pool of self-renewing lymphoid progenitors and needs to be continually seeded by hematopoietic stem cell from bone marrow (4Bhandoola A. von Boehmer H. Petrie H.T. Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. Immunity. 2007; 26: 678-689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), the replacement of thymic microenvironment with adipocytes could interfere with T cell generation. Furthermore, the homing of hematopoietic stem cell from bone marrow to thymus is orchestrated by a complex array of chemokines produced by TEC 2The abbreviations used are: TEC, thymic epithelial cell; cTEC, cortical TEC; mTEC, medullary TEC; Ghrl, ghrelin; GH, growth hormone; GHSR, growth hormone secretagogue receptor; TSC, thymic stromal cells; EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; RT-PCR, real-time-PCR; EVA, early V antigen; AIRE, autoimmune regulator; IL, interleukin; PVS, perivascular space; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; MHCII, major histocompatibility complex II; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter. at the cortico-medullary junction, the site of entry of progenitors into thymus (5Petrie H.T. Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 649-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In addition, the cortical and medullary TECs provide a unique microenvironment and cell-cell contact and produce growth factors required for various aspects of T cell development (5Petrie H.T. Zuniga-Pflucker J.C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 25: 649-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Thus, the success of hematopoietic stem cell-based experimental therapies for thymic restoration requires a functional thymic microenvironment. This is evident as the progenitor cells from the young animals develop into defective naive T cells when introduced in an aging thymic microenvironment (6Clise-Dwyer K. Huston G.E. Buck A.L.

Dohkan J. Cheng L. Barnes P.F. Su D.M. Int. Immunol. 2007; 19: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), defects in lymphoid progenitors (9Min H. Montecino-Rodriguez E. Dorshkind K. J.

Kangawa K. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 495-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Apart from being a potent inducer of GH production, ghrelin is also the only known circulating orexigen (12Kojima M. Kangawa K. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 495-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). We and others have demonstrated that ghrelin exerts potent effects on immune cell subsets by inhibiting the proinflammatory cytokines in a growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR)-dependent mechanism (13Dixit V.D. Schaffer E.M. Pyle R.S. Collins G.D. Sakthivel S.K. Palaniappan R. Lillard Jr., J.W. Taub D.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 14Gonzalez-Rey E. Chorny A. Delgado M. Gastroenterology. 2006; 130: 1707-1720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ghrelin and GHSR are also expressed at lower levels in various organs and cell types including thymus (13Dixit V.D. Schaffer E.M. Pyle R.S. Collins G.D. Sakthivel S.K. Palaniappan R. Lillard Jr., J.W. Taub D.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 15Gnanapavan S. Kola B. Bustin S.A. Morris D.G. McGee P. Fairclough P. Bhattacharya S. Carpenter R. Grossman A.B. Korbonits M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 87: 2988-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar). The ghrelin supplementation in old mice increases thymopoiesis, whereas animals lacking ghrelin and GHSR have reduced thymic output with age (16Dixit V.D. Yang H. Sun Y. Weeraratna A.T. Youm Y.H. Smith R.G. Taub D.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 2778-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). During the course of these studies, we observed that ghrelin infusions led to reduction of adipogenic lipid-expressing cells, whereas the absence of ghrelin signaling was associated with increased thymic adipocytes (16Dixit V.D. Yang H. Sun Y. Weeraratna A.T. Youm Y.H. Smith R.G. Taub D.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 2778-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the generation of adipocytes in the thymus during aging.The adipose tissue is believed to be of mesodermal origin; however, precise lineage of white and brown adipocytes remains to be determined (17Gesta S. Tseng Y.H. Kahn C.R. Cell. 2007; 131: 242-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar), and the origin of thymic adipocytes is also unknown. One view is that adipocytes “infiltrate” the perivascular space of the thymus (18Hale L.P. Clark A.G. Li J. Greer P.K. Byers Kraus V. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2001; 25: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, evidence that large lipid-filled adipocytes can migrate and squeeze through tight intercellular spaces in thymic architecture is unavailable. Indeed, it has been speculated that adipogenic progenitors may undergo specific adipogenesis within the thymus and that the prevailing view of adipocyte trafficking in the thymus may be overly simplistic (3Dixit V.D. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2008; 84: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 11Taub D.D. Longo D.L. Immunol. Rev. 2005; 205: 72-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Based on the studies of fibroblast cell lines, it is known that differentiation of preadipocytes to adipocytes involves stages of growth arrest, clonal expansion, early differentiation, and terminal differentiation (19Farmer S.R. Cell Metab. 2006; 4: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). It is also known that γ1 and γ2 isoforms of nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) generated as a result of alternative splicing and promoter usage are induced upon adipogenesis and are required for the maintenance of the differentiated state of the adipocyte (20Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2006; 444: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1573) Google Scholar). A preadipocyte expressing lipid and PPARγ is thus committed to an adipocyte fate; however, it is unknown whether a similar transcriptional program is initiated during ectopic adipocyte development in the thymus. In addition, cellular origin and mechanisms regulating adipogenic programming in the thymus remain to be ascertained.In this report, we investigated a role for ghrelin-ghrelin receptor expression in TSC differentiation into adipogenic cells in the aging thymus. By genetically marking the TECs and fate-mapping experiments, we provide evidence that epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) may be one potential source of adipocytes in the aging thymus. We found that disruption of ghrelin signaling accelerated EMT and increased thymic adiposity, which was correlated with reduced naive T cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMice-The FoxN1-Cre mice were generated and bred to ROSA26RlacZ mice as described previously (21Gordon J. Xiao S. Hughes III, B. Su D.M. Navarre S.P. Condie B.G. Manley N.R. BMC Dev. Biol. 2007; 7: 69Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The generation of Ghrl and GHSR mice has been described previously (22Sun Y. Wang P. Zheng H. Smith R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4679-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). A cohort of 12-month-old female C57/B6 mice (n = 12) mice and ad libitum fed (n = 20) mice was purchased from the NIA-aging rodent colony (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN). All mice were maintained under pathogen-free conditions and fed normal chow diet. All protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Baylor College of Medicine, University of Georgia, and Pennington Biomedical Research Center.Thymic Stromal Cell Culture-Thymic lobes were cleaned of fat and connective tissue, and the capsule was nicked with scissors. Then thymi were flush out as thymocytes in RPMI 1640. Thymi were then treated for 10 min at 37 °C with an enzymatic mixture containing 0.125% collagenase D (Roche Diagnostics), 0.1% DNase type I (Roche Diagnostics) in RPMI 1640. The supernatant was collected, and the digestion was repeated thrice. Thereafter, the thymic fragments were treated with 0.125% collagenase/Dispase (Roche Diagnostics), 0.1% DNase I in RPMI 1640. Cells were filtered through 100-μm mesh and spun at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. The CD45-positive cells were depleted using magnetic beads and CD45- cells were seeded in 24-well culture plates and cultured for 14 days in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium nutrient F12 (with 15 mm HEPES, NaHCO3, l-glutamine, Invitrogen) supplemented with 3 μg/ml insulin, 20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 100 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and the medium was changed twice a week. On day 14, cells were induced to differentiate by changing the medium to Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.5 mm 3-isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 1.7 μm insulin (MDI). After 48 h, the cells were collected to extract total RNA.Cell Preparations and FACS Analysis-The thymi were enzymatically digested as described (23Gray D.H. Seach N. Ueno T. Milton M.K. Liston A. Lew A.M. Goodnow C.C. Boyd R.L. Blood. 2006; 108: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The following monoclonal antibodies were directly coupled to phycoerythrin, fluorescein isothiocyanate, allophycocynanin, or phycoerythrin-CyT and commercially purchased from eBiosciences: CD3, MHCII, Ly5.1, CD45, CD44, CD62L, CD4, and CD8. The CD45 cells were gated out, and lipid-containing cells were analyzed using LipidTox-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Invitrogen). The FACS-Calibur was used for analysis, and all data were analyzed by post-collection compensation using the FlowJO (Tree Star Inc.) software.Immunohistochemistry-The thymi obtained from mice were flash-frozen and subsequently embedded in Stephens Scientific frozen section medium (Riverdale, NJ) and cut into 5–10-μm-thick cryostat sections. At least three serial sections were utilized for each staining. Tissue sections were then fixed with 4% buffered paraformaldehyde and stained with various combinations of the following primary antibodies to mouse antigens: unconjugated rat antibody to ERTR7 (HM1086, Cell Sciences); unconjugated mouse monoclonal antibody to PPARγ (E-8, Santa Cruz); unconjugated rabbit polyclonal anti-aP2 (2120S, Cell signaling); unconjugated rat monoclonal antibody to TROMA-1 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (DSHB), University of Iowa); biotin-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody to UEA-1 (Vector Laboratories); unconjugated rabbit antibody to FSP1 (ab27957, AbCam), CD31 (12-0311-82, eBiosciences); or unconjugated mouse antibody to β-galactosidase (Z378B, Promega). Slides were incubated with the following secondary regents: Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated polyclonal chicken anti-mouse IgG; Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated polyclonal donkey anti-rat IgG; Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated polyclonal chicken anti-rabbit IgG; of Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes). Nuclei were visualized with 4′,6-diamidine-2′phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI, Sigma). Negative controls as obtained by occulting the primary antibody or by using an unrelated IgG displayed no specific labeling. Fluorescence mounting solution (Vector Laboratories) was applied to slides and observed with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 and Zeiss confocal microscope. In addition, for the visualization of lipid droplet, frozen thymic sections were fixed with 4% buffered paraformaldehyde and then stained with LipidTox-Green (Invitrogen) for 20 min. Images were captured using laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss Inc).Real-time RT-PCR-Total RNA was prepared with RNAzol (Isotex Diagnostics). The samples were DNase digested to remove any potential genomic DNA contamination, and the cDNA synthesis and real-time RT-PCR were performed as described previously (13Dixit V.D. Schaffer E.M.

Schaffer E.M. Pyle R.S. Collins G.D. Sakthivel S.K. Palaniappan R. Lillard Jr., J.W. Taub D.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). The GHSR expression has been found to be partially co-localized with keratin 5 expressing mTECs and on keratin 8 cTECs (16Dixit V.D. Yang H. Sun Y. Weeraratna A.T. Youm Y.H. Smith R.G. Taub D.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 2778-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). These findings led us to investigate specific Ghrl and GHSR expression in purified TSC from young and aging mice. Both Ghrl and GHSR mRNA were expressed in CD45+ lymphoid as well as CD45- TSC (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, when compared with 1-month-old mice, we detected a significant reduction of GHSR mRNA expression in CD45- TSC fraction of 12-month-old animals, whereas no significant (p < 0.05) change in Ghrl could be observed (Fig. 1B).Loss of Ghrelin Signals Compromises Thymic Stromal Cell Microenvironment-Aging is known to severely impact the integrity of the TEC compartment (8Gui J. Zhu X. Dohkan J. Cheng L. Barnes P.F. Su D.M. Int. Immunol. 2007; 19: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 23Gray D.H. Seach N. Ueno T. Milton M.K. Liston A. Lew A.M. Goodnow C.C. Boyd R.L. Blood. 2006; 108: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The growth factors required for maintenance of TECs in the aging thymic microenvironment are incompletely understood. Ghrelin regulates T cell function via a GHSR-dependent mechanism (13Dixit V.D. Schaffer E.M. Pyle R.S. Collins G.D. Sakthivel S.K. Palaniappan R. Lillard Jr., J.W. Taub D.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 16Dixit V.D. Yang H.

Investig. 2007; 117: 2778-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), and available evidence indicates that GHSR is also required for the anabolic effects of ghrelin (22Sun Y. Wang P. Zheng H. Smith R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4679-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). To assess the impact of deficient ghrelin-mediated signals, we investigated the 10–15-month-old GHSR-/- mice. When compared with 10-month-old age-matched wild type mice, the GHSR-/- animals displayed loss of keratin 8+ cTEC and UEA1+ mTEC cells in the thymus (Fig. 2A). We then investigated a separate cohort of mice (12 months old from Baylor College of Medicine animal facility) and demonstrate that similar to our IHC results, this cohort of GHSR-/- mice also had a reduced number of CD45-MHCII+Ly51- mTEC and CD45-MHCII+Ly51+ cTEC cells (Fig. 2B). We next studied the expression of stromal genes that play a key role in thymic function. The early V antigen (EVA) is a constitutively cTEC expressed gene (24Rossi S. Blazar B.R. Farrell C.L. Danilenko D.M. Lacey D.L. Weinberg K.I. Krenger W. Holländer G.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 682-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), and autoimmune regulator (Aire), expressed in a subset of mTEC cells (25Anderson M.S. Venanzi E.S. Klein L. Chen Z. Berzins S.P. Turley S.J. von Boehmer H. Bronson R. Dierich A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Science. 2002; 298: 1395-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar), is critical for thymic function. We observed that 12-month-old Ghrl-/- and GHSR-/- mice had significant reduction in EVA, Aire, and IL-7 mRNA expression with no change in fibroblast growth factor-7 (FGF7) levels (Fig. 2C). These findings are consistent with our hypothesis that ghrelin signaling may be required for TEC maintenance.FIGURE 2Loss of ghrelin signals compromises thymic stromal microenvironment during aging. A, the thymic cryosections were labeled for keratin 8+ cortical TEC using anti-TROMA1 antibody, and medullary TECs were identified by biotin-conjugated plant lectin Ulex europaeus agglutinin 1 (UEA-1). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. C, cTEC; M, mTEC. B, the CD45- thymic stromal cells were stained for Ly51 and MHCII to distinguish cTEC and mTEC cells. A deletion of GHSR reduces both cTEC and mTEC population in 12-month-old mice. C, the real-time-PCR analysis of EVA, Aire, IL-7, and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) in thymi of 12-month-old GHSR and Ghrl null mice and control littermates. D, the thymic cryosections were labeled for the fibroblast-specific marker ERTR7 (red) and LipidTox (green). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. The arrows indicate the lipid-expressing fibroblasts in the PVS of thymus. A representative image from a minimum of four thymi in each group is shown. E, the CD45- TSC were pooled from six thymi of control and GHSR null mice in 10-month-old and 15-month-old age groups and stained with LipidTox-fluorescein isothiocyanate, and FACS analysis was performed in two separate cohorts of mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Given our previous findings that 24-month-old GHSR-/- mice have increased adipocytes in thymic space (16Dixit V.D. Yang H. Sun Y. Weeraratna A.T. Youm Y.H. Smith R.G. Taub D.D. J. Clin. Investig. 2007; 117: 2778-2790Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), we next investigated whether thymic fibroblasts serve as adipogenic precursors during aging. Using ERTR7 as a marker of fibroblasts, we detected increased labeling for ERTR7 in 12-month-old GHSR-/- mice (Fig. 2D), whereas the isotype control antibody showed no specific staining (data not shown). Recent studies by Boyd and colleagues (26Gray D.H. Tull D. Ueno T. Seach N. Classon B.J. Chidgey A. McConville M.J. Boyd R.L. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 4956-4965Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) have also demonstrated that aging is associated with increase in thymic fibroblasts. Interestingly, we observed an increase in lipid-expressing perivascular fibroblasts in GHSR-/- mice, suggesting their adipogenic nature. We next quantitated the lipid-expressing cells in the thymus during aging using FACS analysis and demonstrated that in 10- and 15-month-old mice, the absence of ghrelin-mediated signals leads to significant increase in CD45-LipidTox+ adipogenic cells in the thymus (Fig. 2E). Thus, our data suggest that GHSR may serve to limit the adipogenesis within TSCs and that loss of GHSR-mediated signals may contribute to increased thymic adipogenic cells.Deficient Ghrelin Receptor Signaling Regulates EMT in Aging Thymus-Considering that GHSR null animals exhibited reduction in TECs, an increase in thymic fibroblasts led us to hypothesize that this might be related to the process of EMT. The EMT is a process whereby epithelial cells assume a mesenchymal phenotype via cellular transition (27Hay E.D. Dev. Dyn. 2005; 233: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The EMT is a defining structural mechanism of organ development during embryogenesis (27Hay E.D. Dev. Dyn. 2005; 233: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). However, in adult life, the EMT can also be a source of local tissue fibroblasts, which are known to cause several fibrotic diseases (28Iwano M. Plieth D. Danoff T.M. Xue C. Okada H. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). An important question arising from the findings of age-related loss of thymic epithelial cells and increase in fibroblast is whether EMT is an underlying mechanism in the aging thymus. Also, mesenchymal cells are highly plastic and multipotent in nature and can give rise to adipocytes in vitro (29Mani S.A. Guo W. Liao M.J. Eaton E.N. Ayyanan A. Zhou A.Y. Brooks M. Reinhard F. Zhang C.C. Shipitsin M. Campbell L.L. Polyak K. Brisken C. Yang J. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2008; 133: 704-715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6663) Google Scholar). However, the determination of cell lineage by gene expression analysis or in vitro studies is insufficient because transcriptional signatures are transient and subject to epigenetic or regulatory influences. Hence, the true origin of a cell can only be determined by genetic lineage tracing. To this end, we developed the FoxN1Cre;R26RstopLacZ double transgenic mouse to test the hypothesis that EMT contributes toward generation of a subset of local thymic fibroblasts.The FoxN1 gene is expressed by the TECs, and in FoxN1Cre mice, the IRES-Cre cassette has been knocked-in into the 3′-untranslated region of FoxN1 genomic locus; thus, Cre expression causes a permanent genetic change in all cells that express FoxN1 (21Gordon J. Xiao S. Hughes III, B. Su D.M. Navarre S.P. Condie B.G. Manley N.R. BMC Dev. Biol. 2007; 7: 69Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the R26RstopLacZ indicator mice, the lacZ gene is expressed upon Cre-mediated excision of a loxP STOP cassette. Therefore, in the FoxN1Cre;R26RstopLacZ double transgenic mice, the lacZ expression persists in cells that have ever expressed FoxN1, despite any subsequent age-related phenotypic alterations or cellular transitions (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Ghrelin regulates epithelial-to mesenchymal transition in the thymus. A, the FoxN1-Cre-expressing mice were bred with indicator mice that contain the LacZ gene integrated into the ubiquitous ROSA26 locus downstream of a floxed transcriptional STOP sequence. Expression of Cre recombinase in TECs excised the floxed STOP sequence and indelibly marked the cells with LacZ. B, immunofluorescence triple labeling in 3-month-old FoxN1Cre; ROSA26RstoplacZ reporter mice thymus with DAPI (blue), antibodies to β-galactosidase (indelibly marked TEC), and FSP-1 (EMT marker). The EMT is evident by medullary expression and co-localization of FSP1 with β-galactosidase. Thymic cryosections of 3-month-old FoxN1Cre;ROSA26RstoplacZ mice were triple labeled with antibodies to FSP1 (blue), β-galactosidase (red), and neutral lipid by LipidTox (green) or PPARγ (green).

https://openalex.org/W1963682802,"The formation of disulfides within proteins entering the secretory pathway is catalyzed by the protein disulfide isomerase family of endoplasmic reticulum localized oxidoreductases. One such enzyme, ERp57, is thought to catalyze the isomerization of non-native disulfide bonds formed in glycoproteins with unstructured disulfide-rich domains. Here we investigated the mechanism underlying ERp57 specificity toward glycoprotein substrates and the interdependence of ERp57 and the calnexin cycle for their correct folding. Our results clearly show that ERp57 must be physically associated with the calnexin cycle to catalyze isomerization reactions with most of its substrates. In addition, some glycoproteins only require ERp57 for correct disulfide formation if they enter the calnexin cycle. Hence, the specificity of ER oxidoreductases is not only determined by the physical association of enzyme and substrate but also by accessory factors, such as calnexin and calreticulin in the case of ERp57. These conclusions suggest that the calnexin cycle has evolved with a specialized oxidoreductase to facilitate native disulfide formation in complex glycoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W2025167652,"The balance of T-cell proliferation, anergy and apoptosis is central to immune function. In this regard, co-receptor CTLA-4 is needed for the induction of anergy and tolerance. One central question concerns the mechanism by which CTLA-4 can induce T-cell non-responsiveness without a concurrent induction of antigen induced cell death (AICD). In this study, we show that CTLA-4 activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) and protein kinase B (PKB/AKT) sustains T-cell anergy without cell death. CTLA-4 ligation induced PI 3K activation as evidenced by the phosphorylation of PKB/AKT that in turn inactivated GSK-3. The level of activation was similar to that observed with CD28. CTLA-4 induced PI 3K and AKT activation also led to phosphorylation of the pro-apoptotic factor BAD as well as the up-regulation of BcL-XL. In keeping with this, CD3/CTLA-4 co-ligation prevented apoptosis under the same conditions where T-cell non-responsiveness was induced. This effect was PI 3K and PKB/AKT dependent since inhibition of these enzymes under conditions of anti-CD3/CTLA-4 co-ligation resulted in cell death. Our findings therefore define a mechanism by which CTLA-4 can induce anergy (and possibly peripheral tolerance) by preventing the induction of cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2070101283,"GATA3 is a critical transcription factor for many developmental processes. During T helper (Th) cell differentiation, GATA3 induces the Th2 and suppresses the Th1 pathway. Stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR) of naive Th cells in the presence of interleukin 4 (IL-4) induces robust expression of GATA3; however, it is unclear where these signals integrate. Gata3 encodes two transcripts that differ in their alternative, untranslated first exons. We show here the involvement of the TCR-inducible transcription factor NFAT1 in the transcriptional regulation of both Gata3 transcripts following TCR stimulation of naive and differentiated Th2 cells. We also show that IL-4 is important for the initiation and establishment of Gata3 transcription in developing Th2 cells, especially from the distal promoter. The early function of IL-4 can be STAT6 dependent or independent. However, the establishment of the activity of the distal promoter is totally dependent on STAT6, whereas it is likely that the proximal promoter has additional activation mechanisms that are STAT6 independent.

Robust GATA3 expression can be achieved through stimulation of both the TCR and IL-4R (49Asnagli H. Afkarian M. Murphy K.M. J. Immunol... 2002; 168: 4268-4271Google Scholar). GATA3 is degraded by the proteasomal machinery following ubiquitination, but is stabilized by the Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activated by the TCR stimulation (50Yamashita M. Shinnakasu R. Asou H. Kimura M. Hasegawa A. Hashimoto K. Hatano N. Ogata M. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 29409-29419Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether the TCR signaling pathway also regulates GATA3 expression at other levels, such as transcription. The transcription factor STAT6, which is activated by the IL-4R, induces Gata3 mRNA expression (51Kurata H. Lee H. O'Garra A. Arai N. Immunity.. 1999; 11: 677-688Google Scholar), but whether this is a direct effect is also unknown. Th2 differentiation can still be elicited in the absence of IL-4 (52Finkelman F.D. Morris S.C.

Immunity.. 2000; 12: 27-37Google Scholar). Alternative pathways for the induction of Gata3 expression probably involve the activation of receptors such as Notch, whose ligands are expressed on antigen-presenting cells (55Amsen D. Antov A.

Immunol... 2002; 168: 4268-4271Google Scholar), 1a and 1b. The proximal promoter, which drives expression of the exon 1b-containing transcript, is selectively active in the thymus but not in the brain, whereas the distal promoter, which is located 10-kb upstream and drives the 1a-containing transcript, is active in the brain but not in the thymus, and gradually increases its activity during Th2 development (49Asnagli H. Afkarian M. Murphy K.M. J. Immunol... 2002; 168: 4268-4271Google Scholar). The distal promoter was recently identified as a direct target of Notch during Th2 differentiation (55Amsen D. Antov A.

Blacklow S.C. Pear W.S. Immunity.. 2007; 27: 100-110Google Scholar). To date, very little is known about the transcriptional regulation of Gata3 and the differential activity of the proximal and distal promoters. Here we quantified the dynamic expression of both Gata3 transcripts during the differentiation and after the restimulation of Th cells, and tested their transcriptional dependence on inputs downstream of the TCR and IL-4R.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMice—Four-week-old female Balb/c mice were purchased from Harlan Biotech, Israel. Stat6-/- mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and maintained under pathogen-free conditions in the animal facility of the Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology. These studies were reviewed and approved by the Inspection Committee on the Constitution of Animal Experimentation at Technion.In Vitro Th Cell Differentiation—Th cell differentiation was carried out as previously described (58Jacob E. Hod-Dvorai R. Schif-Zuck S. Avni O. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 13471-13481Google Scholar). CD4+ T cells were purified from the spleen and lymph nodes of 4-week-old mice, with magnetic beads (Dynal). For Th cell differentiation, the cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml purified anti-CD3ϵ antibodies (145.2C11) and 1 μg/ml anti-CD28 antibodies (37.51, BD Pharmingen) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, l-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, nonessential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, vitamins, HEPES, and 2-mercaptoethanol, in a flask coated with 0.3 mg/ml goat anti-hamster antibodies (MP). For Th1 differentiation, the cells were stimulated in the presence of 10 ng/ml recombinant mouse IL-12 (R&D Systems) and 10 μg/ml purified anti-IL-4 antibodies (11B11). For Th2 differentiation, the cells were stimulated in the presence of 1000 units/ml mouse IL-4 (added as a supernatant of the 13L6 cell line), 5 μg/ml purified anti-interferon γ antibodies (XMG1.2), and 3 μg/ml purified anti-IL-12 antibodies (C178). After 2 days, the medium was expanded (4-fold) in the absence of anti-CD3ϵ and anti-CD28 antibodies, but in the continued presence of the cytokines and antibodies, which included 12 units/ml IL-2. The medium was then expanded every other day. After 8 days, the differentiated Th cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with PMA (15 nm) and ionomycin (0.75 μm). When indicated, 1 μm cyclosporine A (CsA) was added 0.5 h before stimulation, and 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (Act D) was added 0.5 h after stimulation. For short stimulation of naive cells, 4 × 107 cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-CD3ϵ and 1 μg/ml anti-CD28 antibodies in the presence of 160 μl of protein G beads coated with goat anti-hamster IgG for 45 min. Unstimulated cells were cultured without antibodies in the presence of the beads.RNA Extraction and Real-time PCR—RNA was extracted using TriReagent (Sigma), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and was reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) using random primers (Amersham Biosciences). Quantitative PCR was preformed with Absolute Blue SYBR-Green ROX Mix (Thermo Scientific, ABgene) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the Rotor-Gene™ 6000 system (Corbett Research, Sydney, Australia) and its software, version 1.7. The amounts of transcript were normalized to that of β2-μ-globin. Melting curves were determined to ensure the amplification of a single product. The primers used for the exon-specific quantitative PCR analysis were: 1a, 5′-GAGCGTCAGCAACAGTGAAG-3′ and 5′-CCACACTGCACACTGATTCC-3′; 1b, 5′-CAATCTGACCGGGCAGGT-3′ and 5′-CAGAGACGGTTGCTCTTCCG-3′; β2-μ-globin, 5′-TTCTGGTGCTTGTCTCACTGA-3′ and 5′-CAGTATGTTCGGCTTCCCATTC-3′.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP analysis was carried out as previously described (58Jacob E. Hod-Dvorai R. Schif-Zuck S. Avni O. J. Biol. Chem... 2008; 283: 13471-13481Google Scholar). Cells (10–24 × 107) were cross-linked on ice for 20 min, by adding a one-tenth volume of 11% formaldehyde solution (0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0) directly to the medium. Glycine was then added to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Following an incubation in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.4), 10 mm dithiothreitol, the cells were washed and resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 mm iodoacetamide) and sonicated three times with 1-min intervals at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 12 °C, and the cleared supernatants were diluted with an equal volume of dilution buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and protease inhibitors). Aliquots containing ∼3 × 107 cells were stored at -80 °C. The samples were thawed in 1 ml of dilution buffer and pre-cleared with 40 μl of a slurry of salmon sperm DNA-coated Protein A- or G-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C (the beads were incubated first with 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA). After 10 min of high-speed centrifugation, the cleared samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg of specific antibody followed by a 3-h incubation with the salmon sperm DNA beads. The specific antibodies used were mouse anti-GATA3 (HG 3.31, Santa Cruz), goat anti-GATA3 (d-16, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-STAT6 (M-20, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-STAT6 (M-200, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-Notch1 (C-20R, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-NFAT-1 (T2B1 and 67.1 (59Avni O. Lee D. Macian F. Szabo S.J. Glimcher L.H. Rao A. Nat. Immunol... 2002; 3: 643-651Google Scholar)), and rabbit anti-acetyl-histone H3 K-9 and K-14 (C-20, Upstate). After the immunoprecipitation, washes, and reverse cross-linking, the samples were extracted twice with phenol/chloroform and once with chloroform, and then ethanol precipitated in the presence of 30 μg of glycogen.20 μl (out of the resuspended 130 μl) was used for PCR: 2.5 min at 95 °C, 28–30 cycles (30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 48 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C), completed by 10 min at 72 °C. As a control, PCR was performed directly on input DNA purified from the chromatin before immunoprecipitation. Selected input samples were also amplified with each pair of specific primers. The PCR products were resolved on 3% NuSieve-agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. The following primers were used: Il4 enhancer VA, 5′-AGGGCACTTAAACATTGC-3′ and 5′-ACGCCTAAGCACAATTCC-3′ (239-bp product); Il4 site V, 5′-TGTTTGGGTAAGACGACG-3′ and 5′-AGCCTCCAGACAAATTGG-3′ (240-bp product); Gata3 distal promoter, (b) 5′-ACACTGCAGTTATCTGGG-3′ and 5′-ACTTCACACCACTGCTGC-3′ (295-bp product), (c) 5′-GTGTTTACTCCAAGCAGG-3′ and 5′-ATTGCTGCTGTCTAATCC-3′ (229-bp product), (d) 5′-TGACCGTGCCCATAGAAC-3′ and 5′-GCCTGAAATGTGACCTGC-3′ (186-bp product).

Each sample was normalized to the value obtained from the input material for that sample without immunoprecipitation. The values of the controls without antibody were subtracted from the samples. Melting curves were determined to ensure the amplification of a single product. The following primers were used: Il4 enhancer VA,5′-GACTGAGAACCCAACAGAGATGC-3′ and 5′-GCCTTGGTTCCATATATTCATGACT-3′ (79-bp product); Gata3 distal promoter, 5′-TGCCTATGATAATGGCCCATTC-3′ and 5′-CTGCTCCTGGTGCCTACAAAG-3′ (101-bp product); Gata3 proximal promoter, (a) 5′-ATGCATCGCGTTGTCACTAA-3′ and 5′-CCAAACCTCTCCAGAACGAA-3′ (104-bp product), (b) 5′-AAACGTTCTGGCTTGAATCCT-3′ and 5′-AGATTATTCCGTACGAGTGA-3′ (122-bp product); Exon 1b 5′-CTGGCGCCGTCTTGATAGTT-3′ and 5′-GGTCAGATTGCGTAGCTCTCTATGT-3′ (123-bp product); CNS I, (a) 5′-AAGCAGATAATCTGGAAAGC-3′ and 5′-TCTGTCCTGCTCACATATCC-3′ (119-bp product).Nuclear/Cytoplasmic Extraction and Western Blotting—Cells were centrifuged for 7 min at 2000 × g, 4 °C, and the pellet was collected with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged for 5 min at 6000 × g. The supernatant was discarded, followed by another short centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 9 volumes of HL buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) and incubated for 30 min on ice, followed by centrifugation for 5 min at 600 × g, 4 °C. 8 volumes of supernatant was collected into a new tube containing an equal volume of 2× GSLB buffer (90 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 500 mm KCl, 0.15% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol), and defined as the “cytoplasmic fraction.” The rest of the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed with 9 volumes of HL buffer followed by spinning for 5 min at 600 × g, 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 1× GSLB buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 250 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol), followed by incubation for 30 min on ice. The tubes were then centrifuged for 10 min, maximum speed, at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected into a new tube, and defined as the “nuclear fraction.” The samples were fractionated by electrophoresis on 12% SDS gels, followed by transfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). The membranes were stained with anti-GATA3, anti-Lamin-B (Santa Cruz), and anti-γ-tubulin (Sigma) antibodies.RESULTSDynamic Changes in the Expression Levels of Gata3 Transcripts—The first alternative exons of the Gata3 transcripts (1a and 1b) are spliced to a common second exon, which contains the translation start site (49Asnagli H. Afkarian M. Murphy K.M. J. Immunol... 2002; 168: 4268-4271Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). To quantify the ratio between the expression levels of the Gata3 transcripts during Th cell development and in the differentiated Th cells, we performed an exon-specific quantitative PCR analysis. First, the mRNA amounts were monitored in developing Th2 cells during the first 2 days following stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (Fig. 1B). The level of both transcripts was increased more than 10 times after 48 h; the expression of the 1b-containing transcript was augmented gradually, whereas the 1a-containing transcript was up-regulated significantly during the second day. Then, after 8 days of differentiation, Th1 and Th2 cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with PMA and ionomycin for the indicated time periods between 1 and 4 h, and the mRNA levels were evaluated (Fig. 1C). As expected, the Th1 cells expressed negligible amounts of the Gata3 transcripts. At 4 h after stimulation, the expression level of both transcripts had increased ∼1.5 times in the Th2 cells. In both developing and differentiated Th2 cells, the 1b-containing transcript was more abundant than the 1a-containing one (Fig. 1D); however, the ratio was dynamic: ∼600 in naive cells, peaking between 4 and 24 h to an average value of ∼2000 and then decreasing to ∼20 in resting differentiated cells. Fig. 6 below shows that the dramatic decline in the ratio is the result of a sharp induction in the expression of the 1a-containing transcript after the second day, whereas the 1b-containing transcript reaches its expression peak earlier.FIGURE 6The expression of the 1a-containing transcript is dependent on STAT6 even after the second day of Th2 differentiation. Naive CD4+ cells were differentiated under Th2 conditions for 48 h and then maintained under the Th2 conditions (Th2) or transferred to neutral conditions without IL-4 and in the presence of anti-IL-4 antibodies (Th2 → N) for the indicated time periods. The Gata3 mRNA level of the 1b-containing transcript (left panel) or the 1a-containing transcript (right panel) was measured. The expression in naive cells was set as 1. Data show the mean of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test whether the stability of the transcripts plays a role in their differential expression rates, we terminated transcription with Act D. Act D was added to (i) differentiating Th2 cells 48 h after stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (Fig. 1E, left panel), (ii) 8-day resting differentiated Th2 cells (middle panel), and (iii) differentiated Th2 cells 30 min after restimulation (right panel). At the indicated time points, between 0 and 4 h after Act D was added, the cells were harvested and the amount of both transcripts was determined. No major changes were found in the degradation rates of either the 1a- or 1b-containing transcript in developing, resting, or restimulated cells. Therefore, the differential amounts of the transcripts is most likely a result of selective transcriptional rates, although we cannot rule out the possibility that Act D terminates the transcription of an inducible regulator of the Gata3 mRNA stability.A ChIP assay showed that the proximal promoter is preferentially acetylated on histone H3 (AcH3) in naive cells (Fig. 1F, left panel). This level of acetylation was maintained for 24 h in differentiating Th1 cells and increased in both the proximal and distal promoters during Th2 differentiation. The proximal promoter was more acetylated than the distal one also in the 24-h differentiating Th2 cells (left panel) and in the 1-week differentiated Th2 cells (right panel). Thus, differences in the acetylation status might underlie the dominance of the proximal promoter. Taken together, these results show that during in vitro Th2 differentiation, the proximal promoter is more active, especially during the early developmental stages, but also in the differentiated cells, although less strikingly.Identification of Conserved Non-coding Sequences (CNSs) at the Gata3 Locus—Next, we wanted to test whether transcription factors downstream of the IL-4R and TCR are directly bound to Gata3, and whether they have differential effects on the activity of the Gata3 promoters.

Non-invasive techniques, liver stiffness measurements (LSM) and biomarkers [FibroTest® (FT)], are widely used in countries where they are available. The aim was to identify factors associated with LSM accuracy using FT as a non-invasive endpoint and vice versa. Methods The proof of concept was taken using the manufacturers recommendations for excluding patients at high risk of false negative/positive. The hypothesis was that the concordance between LSM and FT, would be improved by excluding high-risk patients. Thereafter, the impact of potential variability factors was assessed by the same methods. Liver biopsy and independent endpoints were used to validate the results. Results Applying manufacturers' recommendations in 2,004 patients increased the strength of concordance between LSM and FT (P<0.00001). Among the 1,338 patients satisfying recommendations, the methodology identified a significant LSM operator effect (P = 0.001) and the following variability factors (all P<0.01), related to LSM: male gender, older age, and NAFLD as a cause of liver disease. Biopsy confirmed in 391 patients these results. Conclusion This study has validated the concept of using the strength of concordance between non-invasive estimates of liver fibrosis for the identification of factors associated with variability and precautions of use."
https://openalex.org/W1969189307,"Cationic amphipathic drugs, such as amiodarone, interact preferentially with lipid membranes to exert their biological effect. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, toxic levels of amiodarone trigger a rapid influx of Ca(2+) that can overwhelm cellular homeostasis and lead to cell death. To better understand the mechanistic basis of antifungal activity, we assessed the effect of the drug on membrane potential. We show that low concentrations of amiodarone (0.1-2 microm) elicit an immediate, dose-dependent hyperpolarization of the membrane. At higher doses (>3 microm), hyperpolarization is transient and is followed by depolarization, coincident with influx of Ca(2+) and H(+) and loss in cell viability. Proton and alkali metal cation transporters play reciprocal roles in membrane polarization, depending on the availability of glucose. Diminishment of membrane potential by glucose removal or addition of salts or in pma1, tok1Delta, ena1-4Delta, or nha1Delta mutants protected against drug toxicity, suggesting that initial hyperpolarization was important in the mechanism of antifungal activity. Furthermore, we show that the link between membrane hyperpolarization and drug toxicity is pH-dependent. We propose the existence of pH- and hyperpolarization-activated Ca(2+) channels in yeast, similar to those described in plant root hair and pollen tubes that are critical for cell elongation and growth. Our findings illustrate how membrane-active compounds can be effective microbicidals and may pave the way to developing membrane-selective agents."
https://openalex.org/W1998810377,"During epithelial homeostasis, stem cells divide to produce progenitor cells, which not only proliferate to generate the cell mass but also respond to cellular signaling to transition from a proliferative state to a differentiation state. Such a transition involves functional alterations of transcriptional factors, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Recent studies have implicated Kruppel-like factors (KLFs) including KLF5 in the renewal and maintenance of stem/progenitor cells. Here we demonstrate that the pro-proliferative factor KLF5 becomes anti-proliferative upon TGFbeta-mediated acetylation in an in vitro model of epithelial homeostasis. In the HaCaT epidermal cell line treated with or without TGFbeta, we found that KLF5 was not only essential for cell proliferation, it was also indispensable for TGFbeta-induced anti-proliferation in these cells. KLF5 inhibited the expression of p15 (CDKN2B), a cell cycle inhibitor, without TGFbeta, but became a coactivator in TGFbeta-induced p15 expression in the same cells. Mechanistically, TGFbeta recruited acetylase p300 to acetylate KLF5, and acetylation in turn altered the binding of KLF5 to p15 promoter, resulting in the reversal of KLF5 function. These studies not only demonstrate that a basic transcription factor can be both pro-proliferation and anti-proliferation in epithelial homeostasis, they also present a unique mechanism for how transcriptional regulation changes during the transition from proliferation to inhibition of proliferation. Furthermore, they establish KLF5 as an essential cofactor for TGFbeta signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1968110070,"The adhesion receptor CD96 (TACTILE) is a transmembrane glycoprotein possessing three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains. Among peripheral blood cells, CD96 is expressed on T cells as well as NK cells and a subpopulation of B cells. A possible function of this receptor in NK cell-mediated killing activities was suggested recently. Moreover, CD96 was described as a tumor marker for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. CD96 binds to CD155 (poliovirus receptor) and nectin-1, an adhesion receptor related to CD155. Here we report that human but not mouse CD96 is expressed in two splice variants possessing either an I-like (variant 1) or V-like (variant 2) second domain. With the notable exception of an AML tumor sample, variant 2 predominates in all the CD96-expressing cell types and tissues examined. Using chimeric human/murine CD96 receptors, we show that the interaction with its ligands is mediated via the outermost V-like domain. In contrast to mouse, however, the binding of human CD96 to CD155 is sensitive to the characteristics of the two downstream domains. This is illustrated by a significantly weaker CD96/CD155 interaction mediated by variant 1 when compared with variant 2. Moreover, recent evidence suggested that mutations in human CD96 correlate with the occurrence of a rare form of trigonocephaly. One such mutation causing a single amino acid exchange in the third domain of human CD96 decreased the capacity of both variants to bind to CD155 considerably, suggesting that a CD96-driven adhesion to CD155 may be crucial in developmental processes.

CD96 is a single pass transmembrane glycoprotein belonging to the Ig superfamily (1Wang P.L. O'Farrell S. Clayberger C. Krensky A.M. J. Immunol.. 1992; 148: 2600-2608Google Scholar). In its extracellular part, CD96 consists of three Ig-like domains in the order VN-term-V-CC-term and a membrane proximal region rich in proline/serine/threonine. It is assumed that extensive O-linked glycomodification of this region equips CD96 with a semi-flexible stalk. Therefore, the Ig-like domains may protrude among other membrane-bound macromolecules comprising the outer layer of the cell (1Wang P.L. O'Farrell S. Clayberger C. Krensky A.M. J. Immunol.. 1992; 148: 2600-2608Google Scholar). Even though such exposed presentation predestines CD96 for roles in adhesion, interaction partners of CD96 as well as its biological function(s) remained largely obscure until recently. However, CD96 was described as tumor marker for T-ALL and AML characteristic for the AML stem cell in particular (2Gramatzki M. Ludwig W.D. Burger R. Moos P. Rohwer P. Grunert C. Sendler A. Kalden J.R. Andreesen R. Henschke F. Moldenhauer G. Exp. Hematol.. 1998; 26: 1209-1214Google Scholar, 3Hosen N. Park C.Y. Tatsumi N. Oji Y. Sugiyama H. Gramatzki M. Krensky A.M. Weissman I.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2007; 104: 11008-11013Google Scholar). Among human peripheral blood cells, CD96 expression was observed on T and NK cells but not on the majority of B cells, monocytes, and granulocytes (4Fuchs A. Cella M. Giurisato E. Shaw A.S. Colonna M. J. Immunol.. 2004; 172: 3994-3998Google Scholar). The murine CD96, characterized recently, is widely expressed on T cells of all developmental and differentiation stages tested albeit to varying extents (5Seth S. Maier M.K. Qiu Q. Ravens I. Kremmer E. Forster R. Bernhardt G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2007; 364: 959-965Google Scholar). This is in line with the original observation of elevated CD96 expression in activated human T cells (1Wang P.L. O'Farrell S. Clayberger C. Krensky A.M. J. Immunol.. 1992; 148: 2600-2608Google Scholar). In humans, CD96 promotes adhesion of NK cells to tumor cells expressing CD155, an interaction that may assist in NK-mediated destruction of the targets (4Fuchs A. Cella M. Giurisato E. Shaw A.S. Colonna M. J. Immunol.. 2004; 172: 3994-3998Google Scholar); yet direct evidence proving CD96 as NK receptor is missing. Although CD155 remained the only identified interaction partner for CD96 in human (4Fuchs A. Cella M. Giurisato E. Shaw A.S. Colonna M. J. Immunol.. 2004; 172: 3994-3998Google Scholar), nectin-1 also binds to CD96 in mouse (5Seth S. Maier M.K. Qiu Q. Ravens I. Kremmer E. Forster R. Bernhardt G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2007; 364: 959-965Google Scholar). Although the significance of the CD96/nectin-1 interaction remains unclear, it is interesting to note that nectin-1 is expressed prominently in brain and, in particular, localizes to the synaptic junctions. Nectin-1-deficient mice suffer from microphthalmia (small eyes), an eye disorder caused by malformation of cell layers of the ciliary epithelia (6Inagaki M. Irie K. Ishizaki H. Tanaka-Okamoto M. Morimoto K. Inoue E. Ohtsuka T. Miyoshi J. Takai Y. Development.. 2005; 132: 1525-1537Google Scholar). In humans, mutations in nectin-1 were associated with the occurrence of cleft lip/palate-ectodermal dysplasia syndrome (7Suzuki K. Hu D. Bustos T. Zlotogora J. Richieri-Costa A. Helms J.A. Spritz R.A. Nat. Genet.. 2000; 25: 427-430Google Scholar), whereas a mutation in CD96 (T280M) or disruption of the genetic locus of CD96 by chromosomal translocation link to a distinct manifestation of the C syndrome (Opitz Trigonocephaly) (8Kaname T. Yanagi K. Chinen Y. Makita Y. Okamoto N. Maehara H. Owan I. Kanaya F. Kubota Y. Oike Y. Yamamoto T. Kurosawa K. Fukushima Y. Bohring A. Opitz J.M. Yoshiura K. Niikawa N. Naritomi K. Am. J. Hum. Genet.. 2007; 81: 835-841Google Scholar). Nectin-1 as well as CD155 belong to a subfamily of Ig-like adhesive receptors (9Takai Y. Irie K. Shimizu K. Sakisaka T. Ikeda W. Cancer Sci.. 2003; 94: 655-667Google Scholar). An evolutionary analysis revealed that the members of this family share a common progenitor with CD96 and CD226 (10Du Pasquier L. Zucchetti I. De Santis R. Immunol. Rev.. 2004; 198: 233-248Google Scholar), another binding partner for CD155 (11Bottino C. Castriconi R. Pende D. Rivera P. Nanni M. Carnemolla B. Cantoni C. Grassi J. Marcenaro S. Reymond N. Vitale M. Moretta L. Lopez M. Moretta A. J. Exp. Med.. 2003; 198: 557-567Google Scholar). Mice deficient for CD155 produce a reduced humoral immune response to soluble antigens entering the organism via the gastrointestinal tract, whereas subcutaneous or systemic immunizations are not affected (12Maier M.K. Seth S. Czeloth N. Qiu Q. Ravens I. Kremmer E. Ebel M. Muller W. Pabst O. Forster R. Bernhardt G. Eur. J. Immunol.. 2007; 37: 2214-2225Google Scholar). These findings document the involvement of CD96 and members of the CD155/nectin family in immunological as well as developmental processes. In this study we were interested to investigate the interaction of CD96 with its binding partners in more detail. To this end, chimeric receptors were generated consisting of distinct mouse and human Ig-like domains. It could be demonstrated that the first domain of CD96 harbors the epitope(s) essentially required for CD155 binding. However, the magnitude of binding is modulated by the second domain in case of human but not mouse CD96. Contrary to murine CD96, human CD96 is alternatively spliced, giving rise to two isoforms differing in the Ig fold of the second domain. Expression analysis by real time PCR revealed that the shorter variant is predominantly expressed in all nonmalignant tissue and cell types investigated. CD155 binds to both splice variants yet with different strength. Moreover, the T280M mutation residing in Ig-like domain three of CD96 resulted in a significantly reduced binding to CD155. Cloning of Human CD96 cDNA—Full-length hCD96 4The abbreviations used are: hCD, human CD; mCD, murine CD; mAb, monoclonal antibody; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol; EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; T-ALL, T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; AML, acute myeloid leukemia; PBSd, PBS deficient in Ca2+ and Mg2+. was cloned out of white blood cell cDNA (Clontech) by PCR (Expand high fidelity; Roche Applied Science). The cycling conditions were: 1 min at 94 °C, then 10 cycles consisting of 15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 2 min at 72 °C, and an additional 15 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, 2 min at 72 °C with an extension time of 5 s/cycle. The primers used were: HCD96.KPN, 5′-GCG GTA CCG GTG TTC AGA AGA CAA TGG AG-3′; and hcd96_xba, 5′-GCT CTA GAC TAG AGG GTC TCC ATC TCA TGA T-3′. After cloning into pcDNA3, the products were sequenced. Two types of cDNA inserts were obtained (see also Ensembl data base entry ENSG00000153283). Variant 1 (hCD96V1) represents the hCD96 version carrying exon 4, whereas in variant 2 (hCD96V2) this exon is missing, causing the absence of 18 amino acids. Exon 4 borders are in frame (phase 0) such that differential splicing does not cause additional amino acid changes. Detection of hCD96 Proteins by Western Blotting—To visualize hCD96 proteins, the pCDNA3 plasmids driving the expression of murine ICAM-1, hCD96V1 or hCD96V2 were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells (see below). After 2 days the cells were surface-biotinylated. The AML cell line KG1 endogenously expressing hCD96 served as a positive control. For biotinylation, ∼5 × 107 cells were detached with PBSd, 10 mm glucose/2 mm EDTA (only for HEK293) and washed twice with PBSd, 10 mm glucose and resuspended in 1 ml of PBSd, 10 mm glucose. 2 mg of biotinylation reagent (No-weigh NHS-PEO4-Biotin; Thermo Scientific) was dissolved in 1 ml of PBSd, 10 mm glucose and added to the cells. The mixture was slowly rotated at room temperature for 30 min and then washed twice with 15 ml of PBSd, 10 mm glucose. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBSd, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, incubated for 20 min on ice, and centrifuged to obtain cell extract. For immunoprecipitations, the cell extracts were rocked gently either with 10 μg of anti-hCD96 antibody TH-111 (2Gramatzki M. Ludwig W.D. Burger R. Moos P. Rohwer P. Grunert C. Sendler A. Kalden J.R. Andreesen R. Henschke F. Moldenhauer G. Exp. Hematol.. 1998; 26: 1209-1214Google Scholar) or 20 μg of recombinant hCD155-hIgG protein along with 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed twice with PBSd, 0.25% Nonidet P-40 and twice with PBSd. The beads were boiled in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer. Following SDS-PAGE on a 10% BisTris gel (Invitrogen), the proteins were blotted, and the biotinylated material was revealed after blocking with dry milk in TBST and incubation/detection with streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Sigma) and nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Construction of Chimeric and Mutant Receptors—Full-length cDNAs coding for hCD96V2 and mCD96 were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to create ClaI or BlpI sites according to the manufacturer's instruction (Stratagene). Although the introduction of the BlpI site was silent, that of the ClaI site caused one amino acid substitution (hCD96, A142T; mCD96, Q141T). Domain interchanges were done applying appropriate restriction enzyme digests. The T280M mutation was inserted into both hCD96 cDNA versions. All of the mutant clones were sequenced to verify their integrity. The primers used were: HCD96D12, 5′-CAT TCA GAC ACA CGT TAC AAT CGA TGA ATG GAA CAG CAA CC; hcd96_d12 5′-GGT TGC TGT TCC ATT CAT CGA TTG TAA CGT GTG TCT GAA TG; HMCD96D23, 5′-TCC ACC ACA GTC AAG GTT TTT GCT AAG CCA GAA ATC C; hmcd96_d23, 5′-GGA TTT CTG GCT TAG CAA AAA CCT TGA CTG TGG TGG A; MUCD96D12, 5′-CAT TGT GGA ACC CTA TAC AAT CGA TGA ACA CAA CTA TAC AAT AG; mucd96_d12, 5′-CTA TTG TAT AGT TGT GTT CAT CGA TTG TAT AGG GTT CCA CAA TG; CD96T280M, 5′-GTG ATT GTG GAA AAT AAC TCC ATG GAT GTC TTG GTA G; and cd96_t280m, 5′-CTA CCA AGA CAT CCA TGG AGT TAT TTT CCA CAA TCA C. Transient Transfection and Binding of Antibodies or Recombinant Proteins—Twenty μg of cDNA encoding the diverse human/murine CD96 versions were transfected into HEK293 cells along with 2 μg of a green fluorescent protein-expressing plasmid applying the standard calcium phosphate transfection technique. The cells were detached 48 h later and incubated with either anti-hCD96 antibody TH-111 or a panel of anti-mCD96 antibodies clones 6A6, 8B10, or 6B4, respectively (see Ref. 5Seth S. Maier M.K. Qiu Q. Ravens I. Kremmer E. Forster R. Bernhardt G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2007; 364: 959-965Google Scholar for details). Rat anti-mouse IgG-Cy5 or mouse anti-rat IgG-Cy5 secondary antibodies were used for detection. CD155 and nectin-1 were expressed and purified as recombinant hIgG1 proteins as described earlier (5Seth S. Maier M.K. Qiu Q. Ravens I. Kremmer E. Forster R. Bernhardt G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2007; 364: 959-965Google Scholar). They consist of the entire ectodomain of CD155 or nectin fused to domains 3 + 4 of hIgG1. Transfected cells were first incubated with 2 μg of recombinant protein on ice and washed twice, and bound protein was detected by mouse anti-human biotin/streptavidin PerCP. For titration of recombinant protein on HEK293 cells transiently expressing hCD96V1, hCD96V1m, hCD96V2, or hCD96V2m, respectively, the cells were incubated with the indicated amounts of recombinant hCD155-hIgG1 in 50 μl of PBSd, 2% fetal calf serum for 1 h on ice. After three washes bound protein was detected using goat anti-hIgG-bio/streptavidin Cy5. In parallel samples, the cells were incubated with decreasing amounts of mAb TH-111 and washed, and bound mAb revealed by adding rat anti-mouse IgG-Cy5. For flow cytometry, propidium iodide was added to exclude dead cells from analysis. The cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur or LSRII (BD Biosciences), and the data were evaluated using WinList5.0. The binding of mAb and recombinant protein (as seen in Fig. 3) was normalized to cover a range from 0 to 100, where 100 was assigned to the binding to the parental receptors (hhh in case of TH-111 and hCD155-IgG; mmm for 6A6, 8B10, 6B4, and mCD155-IgG, respectively) using the following formula. relative binding=linMeanX−linMeanXbase linelinMeanXphysiological−linMeanXbase line⋅100(Eq. 1) Three independent experiments were included in the analysis, allowing the calculation of the mean and S.D. for representation. The TH-111 binding efficiencies to different hCD96 variants (Fig. 4) were determined by titration. The linMeanX values were normalized for plotting using the following formula. normalized mAb binding=linMeanXsample−linMeanXbase linelinMeanXmax−linMeanXbase line⋅100(Eq. 2) Signals detected from protein binding were corrected to include the expression level of each CD96 variant by dividing by the half-maximal signal of mAb TH-111. corrected binding=linMeanX(CD155)linMeanX50(TH−111)(Eq. 3) The results were then normalized to a scale from 0 to 100, thereby adjusting the strongest binding (elicited by hCD96V2 binding to the highest amount of hCD155-IgG) to 100. Three independent experiments were included in the analysis, allowing the calculation of the mean and S.D. for representation. Electroporation of Raji Cells and Cell Adhesion Assay—Raji cells were grown in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum and taken up at 2 × 107 cells/ml in growth medium following centrifugation. 400 μl of cells were mixed in a cuvette (0.4 cm electrode gap) with 10–20 μg of expression plasmid, 10 μl of 0.2 m ATP, and 3 μl of 1 m MgCl2. Electroporation was done at 240 V and 1,500 microfarad. The cells were then kept for 2 days in growth medium. For cell adhesion assays, EYFP-tagged hCD96 receptors were constructed. First, the XbaI fragment of vector pEYFP (Clontech) containing the open reading frame for the fluorescent protein EYFP was cloned into pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) to yield vector pCDNA3-EYFP. Next, hCD96 fusion fragments encompassing the entire ectodomain of either hCD96 variant were generated by PCR for in frame cloning into the BamHI site of pCDNA3-EYFP. PCR conditions were as described above with the full-length hCD96 clones as templates using the following primers: HSCD96.BAM, 5′-GCG GAT CCG GTG TTC AGA AGA CAA TGG AG; and hscd96_bamfus, 5′-GCG GAT CCA GGG TCT CCA TCT CAT GAT AAG G. The correct sequences of the fusion clones, hCD96V1-EYFP and hCD96V2-EYFP, was verified by sequencing. Expression of the fusion proteins following transfection into HEK293 cells confirmed that EYFP fluorescence linearly increased with the amount of bound anti-hCD96 antibody, thus providing a tool for monitoring expression efficiency (not shown). 96-well plates were coated with 1 μg/100 μl of PBSd/well of recombinant hCD155-hIgG or murine nectin-2-hIgG protein overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed with RPMI 1640, 10% fetal calf serum before 2 × 106 Raji cells in ∼200 μl of growth medium/well, transiently expressing equal percentages, and amounts of hCD96 fusion receptors were seeded into 96-well plates in triplicate. Raji cells expressing cytosolic EYFP following transfection of vector pCDNA3-EYFP served as controls. The plates were then spun shortly and incubated for 90 min. at 37 °C. Unbound cells were then removed by two washing steps using 200 μl of growth medium. The attached cells were quantified using the CellTiter96 nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Isolation of Primary Human Cells, RNA Preparation, and Real Time PCR—White blood cells from healthy donors were prepared using a Biocoll (Biochrom) gradient. The obtained cells from 40 ml of blood were MACS sorted using the CD56 MultiSort kit (Miltenyi), and the CD56+ cell population was stained with mouse anti-hCD3-PerCP (BD Biosciences) to sort out CD3- NK cells on a FACSAria (BD Biosciences). The CD3+ CD4+ and CD3+ CD8+ subpopulations were isolated accordingly from human blood following MACS separation of CD3+ cells with CD3 MicroBeads (Miltenyi) and subsequent staining with anti-CD4/anti-CD8 mAb (in-house preparations) and flow cytometric separation. Monocytes and B cells were obtained as CD14+ and CD20+ fractions following MACS separation. The purity (>95%) of all isolated populations was confirmed by reanalysis. Total RNA was prepared using the Absolutely RNA Microprep Kit (Stratagene). RNA was reverse transcribed (Superscript II reverse transcriptase; Invitrogen) using random hexamer primers. For other human fetal and adult tissues, premade template cDNAs were used (human MTC panel II, human immune system MTC panel, and human fetal MTC panel; Clontech). The ages of the spontaneously aborted fetuses were: 20–33 weeks (fetal brain), 16–32 weeks (fetal spleen), 21–37 weeks (fetal kidney), and 16–32 weeks (fetal thymus). cDNA samples representing AML and T-ALL (13Cario G. Izraeli S. Teichert A. Rhein P. Skokowa J. Moricke A. Zimmermann M. Schrauder A. Karawajew L. Ludwig W.D. Welte K. Schunemann H.J. Schlegelberger B. Schrappe M. Stanulla M. J. Clin. Oncol.. 2007; 25: 4813-4820Google Scholar) were obtained from Dr. J. Krauter (Hannover Medical School) and Dr. M. Stanulla (Hannover Medical School). The expression of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase, hCD96V1, and hCD96V2 was analyzed using a Lightcycler 2.0 (Roche Applied Science) and the Fast Start DNA Master plus SYBR Green Kit (Roche Applied Science) or the Sybr Premix Ex Taq Kit (Takara). Standardization and absolute relative quantification of expression levels was done as described (14Czeloth N. Bernhardt G. Hofmann F. Genth H. Forster R. J. Immunol.. 2005; 175: 2960-2967Google Scholar). hCD96 primer combinations used were RTPC96UP/rtpc96_ex4 to detect hCD96V1 and RTPC96UP/rtpc96_alt35 for hCD96V2. Both PCR products were cloned, and the inserts were verified by sequencing. These plasmids were then applied as internal standards and also used to demonstrate that the hCD96V1 specifying primer set did not yield any signal on the hCD96V2 template and vice versa. The primers used were: RTPCD96UP, 5′-AAC AGC AAC CAT ACG ATA GAA ATA GA; rtpcd96_alt35, 5′-TTC CAT TAT CCT CCA CCG ACC; and rtpcd96_ex4, 5′-CTT AGA AAG AAG GAC CCA AGA ATC. Ig Folding Prediction and β-Strand Assignment—The sequences representing the Ig-like domains of CD96 were sent to the PHYRE server of the Imperial College (London, UK) and to the Jpred server of the Barton group, University of Dundee for secondary structure predictions. Human CD96 Exists in Two Splice Variants Affecting the Ig Fold of the Second Domain—When cloning human CD96, we noticed a PCR product that represented a version of CD96 lacking exon 4 (Fig. 1, A and D). This exon is 48 nucleotides in length, preserves the open reading frame when spliced out, and maps to the second Ig-like domain (Fig. 1, A and B). A closer analysis involving strand prediction using two different programs suggests that this Ig-like domain belongs to the V-like subset when containing exon 4 amino acids (hCD96V1), whereas the domain encoded by mRNA lacking exon 4 adopts features resembling an I- or a C-like domain, despite maintaining a V-like core folding pattern (hCD96V2). Notably, we failed to identify the corresponding splice variants in mouse. Alignments suggest that murine CD96 is equivalent to human variant2(i.e. the short one). Attempts to detect a putative variant 1 by PCR applied on several murine organ cDNAs were unsuccessful (Fig. 1, compare D and E). This observation is fitting with the exon/intron organization of the mouse gene that does not offer the equivalent of the short human exon 4 in this region of the gene (not shown). Flow cytometry revealed that CD96 is expressed by the human AML cell line KG1. Therefore, KG1 cells were surface-biotinylated and subjected to immunoprecipitations to visualize hCD96 by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting (Fig. 1F). Both the anti-hCD96 mAb TH-111 as well as recombinant hCD155-hIgG, precipitated a protein with an apparent molecular weight of ∼160 kDa. This confirms earlier observations (1Wang P.L. O'Farrell S. Clayberger C. Krensky A.M. J. Immunol.. 1992; 148: 2600-2608Google Scholar) and indicates extensive post-translational modification as already shown for murine CD96 (5Seth S. Maier M.K. Qiu Q. Ravens I. Kremmer E. Forster R. Bernhardt G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2007; 364: 959-965Google Scholar). Following cloning of the full-length cDNA encoding hCD96V1 and hCD96V2, the sizes of the two variants were analyzed separately following transient expression in HEK293 cells, which are devoid of endogenous hCD96. A clear cut difference in size was not observed, even though hCD96V2 gave rise to a slightly faster migrating band. This also explains why the immunoprecipitate of biotinylated KG1 material appeared as a single band in the Western blot (Fig. 1F), although PCR indicated that both hCD96 variants are expressed by these cells (Fig. 1D). We analyzed the expression pattern of the two human CD96 isoforms in various human organs with a special emphasis on lymphoid tissue. Real time PCR revealed considerable expression of CD96 in peripheral leukocytes, thymus, lymph nodes, tonsils, spleen, as well as colon and moderate levels in ovary and kidney (Fig. 2A). An hCD96-specific message could not be detected in prostate (not shown) and brain. Among fetal tissues, hCD96 was found to be expressed in thymus and spleen at levels comparable with the adult organs and to a considerably lesser extent in kidney and brain. Because we failed to detect hCD96 in adult brain, this may indicate that hCD96 is expressed exclusively during distinct developmental stages. hCD96 was reported to be expressed on T cells, a subpopulation of B cells, and NK cells but not on monocytes and granulocytes. Therefore, white blood cells from healthy donors were isolated, sorted by flow cytometry, and/or magnetic bead separation (see “Experimental Procedures”) and the mRNA levels representing the two hCD96 variants determined in CD19+ B cells, CD3+ CD4+ T cells, CD3+ CD8+ T cells, CD14+ monocytes, and CD3- CD56+ NK cells (Fig. 2B). In all of the subsets studied, hCD96V2 predominated, although a considerable variation of the hCD96 levels between individual blood donors was observed, especially regarding their T cell subpopulations (see error bars in Fig. 2B). Because hCD96 was identified as tumor marker expressed in T-ALL and AML (2Gramatzki M. Ludwig W.D. Burger R. Moos P. Rohwer P. Grunert C. Sendler A. Kalden J.R. Andreesen R. Henschke F. Moldenhauer G. Exp. Hematol.. 1998; 26: 1209-1214Google Scholar, 3Hosen N. Park C.Y. Tatsumi N. Oji Y. Sugiyama H. Gramatzki M. Krensky A.M. Weissman I.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 2007; 104: 11008-11013Google Scholar), it was of interest to test the hCD96 expression pattern in a panel of samples representing these types of leukemias (Fig. 2, C and D). Confirming earlier results, we observed a broad range of expression levels among both AML and T-ALL samples. However, in all of the T-ALL tumors analyzed, hCD96V2 represents the major hCD96 isoform to an extent as already seen for healthy T cells. In AML cells, the general expression level of CD96 seem more moderate when compared with T-ALL, even though also the AML panel is distinguished by a huge variability regarding the individual CD96 expression levels. In contrast to T-ALL, one AML sample (Fig. 2C, A3) displayed a marked switch in the isoform expression pattern usually observed with variant 1 predominating. It has been reported that hCD96 protein levels increase several days following either allogenic or phytohemagglutinin-mediated stimulation, thereby coining the original name of CD96: Tactile (T cell activation, increased late expression) (1Wang P.L. O'Farrell S. Clayberger C. Krensky A.M. J. Immunol.. 1992; 148: 2600-2608Google Scholar). To analyze whether the splicing of hCD96 pre-mRNA is influenced during T cell stimulation, peripheral T cells treated with phytohemagglutinin or anti-CD3 mAb OKT3 were studied. hCD96 protein expression was down-regulated within the first 2–3 days, but at later time points, a significant up-regulation was observed (not shown), thereby confirming earlier results (1Wang P.L. O'Farrell S. Clayberger C. Krensky A.M. J. Immunol.. 1992; 148: 2600-2608Google Scholar). This particular kinetic of regulation was paralleled by the mRNA levels, although these declined earlier and to more pronounced degree. Again, the hCD96 variant specific pattern remained unchanged with hCD96V2 message predominating by a factor of ∼10 at all time points investigated (not shown). The First Ig-like Domain of CD96 Is Necessary for Binding to CD155—We next intended to determine the location of the binding epitopes on CD96 responsible for docking onto CD155 and nec-1. The finding that the CD155/CD96 interaction is not operating across the human/mouse species barrier (5Seth S. Maier M.K. Qiu Q. Ravens I. Kremmer E. Forster R. Bernhardt G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun.. 2007; 364: 959-965Google Scholar) was exploited to construct chimeric human/mouse CD96 receptors based on hCD96V2 and mCD96. To achieve this, restrictions sites were inserted into the domain 1/2 and domain 2/3 borders by site-directed mutagenesis into each receptor cDNA (Fig. 3A). Next, chimeric receptors were cloned by domain exchange (Fig. 3) and named according to their species origin (Fig. 3B). For example, receptor mhh denotes a CD96 chimera where the first human domain was replaced by its murine equivalent. In all of the constructs, the species origin of the third domain also defines that of the S/T/P-rich stalk, the transmembrane region, and the cytoplasmic tail. The receptors were then transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, and binding of recombinant mouse or human CD155-hIgG1 proteins to them was monitored (Fig. 3, D and F). In addition, the binding of various anti-CD96 mAb to the chimeric receptors was tested (Fig. 3, C and E). As expected, the anti-hCD96 mAb TH-111 did not bind at all to the murine receptor. mAb TH-111 binding to chimeric receptors suggests that epitopes residing in the first two domains are recognized. Replacement of the second human domain substantially reduced (hmm) or eliminated binding (hmh, mmh), whereas that of the first domain surprisingly caused increased antibody binding (mhh, mhm). Exchange of the third human domain had only little impact on TH-111 binding. The hCD155 binding profile to the chimeric receptors indicates that the presence of the first human domain is obligatory for the interaction with the second and possi"
https://openalex.org/W2003466571,"Bile acids are steroid detergents that are toxic to mammalian cells at high concentrations; increased exposure to these steroids is pertinent in the pathogenesis of cholestatic disease and colon cancer. Understanding the mechanisms of bile acid toxicity and apoptosis, which could include nonspecific detergent effects and/or specific receptor activation, has potential therapeutic significance. In this report we investigate the ability of synthetic enantiomers of lithocholic acid (ent-LCA), chenodeoxycholic acid (ent-CDCA), and deoxycholic acid (ent-DCA) to induce toxicity and apoptosis in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells. Natural bile acids were found to induce more apoptotic nuclear morphology, cause increased cellular detachment, and lead to greater capase-3 and -9 cleavage compared with enantiomeric bile acids in both cell lines. In contrast, natural and enantiomeric bile acids showed similar effects on cellular proliferation. These data show that bile acid-induced apoptosis in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells is enantiospecific, hence correlated with the absolute configuration of the bile steroid rather than its detergent properties. The mechanism of LCA- and ent-LCA-induced apoptosis was also investigated in HT-29 and HCT-116 cells. These bile acids differentially activate initiator caspases-2 and -8 and induce cleavage of full-length Bid. LCA and ent-LCA mediated apoptosis was inhibited by both pan-caspase and selective caspase-8 inhibitors, whereas a selective caspase-2 inhibitor provided no protection. LCA also induced increased CD95 localization to the plasma membrane and generated increased reactive oxygen species compared with ent-LCA. This suggests that LCA/ent-LCA induce apoptosis enantioselectively through CD95 activation, likely because of increased reactive oxygen species generation, with resulting procaspase-8 cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2109921234,"Background The variable efficacy (0–80%) of Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette Guréin (BCG) vaccine against adult tuberculosis (TB) necessitates development of alternative vaccine candidates. Development of recombinant BCG (rBCG) over-expressing promising immunodominant antigens of M. tuberculosis represents one of the potential approaches for the development of vaccines against TB. Methods/Principal Findings A recombinant strain of BCG - rBCG85C, over expressing the antigen 85C, a secretory immuno-dominant protein of M. tuberculosis, was evaluated for its protective efficacy in guinea pigs against M. tuberculosis challenge by aerosol route. Immunization with rBCG85C resulted in a substantial reduction in the lung (1.87 log10, p<0.01) and spleen (2.36 log10, p<0.001) bacillary load with a commensurate reduction in pathological damage, when compared to the animals immunized with the parent BCG strain at 10 weeks post-infection. rBCG85C continued to provide superior protection over BCG even when post-challenge period was prolonged to 16 weeks. The cytokine profile of pulmonary granulomas revealed that the superior protection imparted by rBCG85C was associated with the reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines - interleukin (IL)-12, interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, moderate levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine - transforming growth factor (TGF)-β along with up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). In addition, the rBCG85C vaccine induced modulation of the cytokine levels was found to be associated with reduced fibrosis and antigen load accompanied by the restoration of normal lung architecture. Conclusions/Significance These results clearly indicate the superiority of rBCG85C over BCG as a promising prophylactic vaccine against TB. The enduring protection observed in this study gives enough reason to postulate that if an open-ended study is carried out with low dose of infection, rBCG85C vaccine in all likelihood would show enhanced survival of guinea pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2033654386,"The role of the 18-kDa isoform of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) in the maintenance of bone mass was examined in Col3.6-18-kDa FGF2-IRES-GFPsaph transgenic (18-kDa TgFGF2) mice in which a 3.6-kb fragment of the type I collagen 5′-regulatory region (Col3.6) drives the expression of only the 18-kDa isoform of FGF2 with green fluorescent protein-sapphire (GFPsaph). Vector only transgenic mice (Col3.6-IRES-GFPsaph, VTg) were also developed as a control, and mice specifically deficient in 18-kDa FGF2 (FGF2lmw-/-) were also examined. Bone mineral density, femoral bone volume, trabecular thickness, and cortical bone area and thickness were significantly increased in 18-kDa TgFGF2 mice compared with VTg. Bone marrow cultures (BMSC) from 18-kDa TgFGF2 mice produced more mineralized nodules than VTg. Increased bone formation was associated with reduced expression of the Wnt antagonist secreted frizzled receptor 1 (sFRP-1). In contrast to 18-kDa TgFGF2 mice, FGF2lmw-/- mice have significantly reduced bone mineral density and fewer mineralized nodules, coincident with increased expression of sFRP-1 in bones and BMSC. Moreover, silencing of sFRP-1 in BMSC from FGF2lmw-/- mice reversed the decrease in β-catenin and Runx2 mRNA. Assay of Wnt/β-catenin-mediated transcription showed increased and decreased TCF-luciferase activity in BMSC from 18-kDa TgFGF2 and FGF2lmw-/- mice, respectively. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the 18-kDa FGF2 isoform is a critical determinant of bone mass in mice by modulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. The role of the 18-kDa isoform of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) in the maintenance of bone mass was examined in Col3.6-18-kDa FGF2-IRES-GFPsaph transgenic (18-kDa TgFGF2) mice in which a 3.6-kb fragment of the type I collagen 5′-regulatory region (Col3.6) drives the expression of only the 18-kDa isoform of FGF2 with green fluorescent protein-sapphire (GFPsaph).

Endocrinology.. 1989; 124: 1539-1547Google Scholar). A single fgf2 gene encodes multiple protein isoforms from alternative translation start sites (2Abraham J.A. Whang J.L. Tumolo A. Mergia A. Friedman J. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. EMBO J.. 1986; 5: 2523-2528Google Scholar, 3Florkiewicz R.Z. Sommer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1989; 86: 3981-3987Google Scholar). Humans express four FGF2 isoforms, including three high molecular mass 22-, 23-, and 24-kDa proteins that have nuclear localization sequences and a low molecular mass 18-kDa FGF2 protein that is exported from cells. In rodents, there are two high molecular mass isoforms of 22 and 21 kDa and a low molecular mass 18-kDa FGF2 protein that is exported from cells. Translation of each of the three high molecular mass human FGF2 isoforms (22, 23, and 24 kDa) is initiated from an unconventional CUG translation initiation codon. In contrast, translation of the 18-kDa FGF2 isoform is initiated from a classical AUG codon located downstream of the CUG codons. Thus, multiple isoforms of FGF2 protein can be expressed from a single mRNA as a result of translation at either AUG (18-kDa protein) or CUG (22-, 23-, and 24-kDa proteins) start sites (2Abraham J.A.

Previous studies showed that constitutive overexpression of all the human FGF2 protein isoforms in transgenic (TgFGF2) mice resulted in chondrodysplasia (5gon Coffin J.D. Florkiewicz R.Z. Neumann J.

Liu P. Sobue T. Lichtler A. Coffin J.D. Hurley M.M. J. Cell. Biochem... 2003; 89: 1291-1301Google Scholar). Counterintuitively, targeted deletion or “knock-out” (KO) of all FGF2 protein isoforms in mice also resulted in decreased bone mass (8Montero A. Okada Y. Tomita M. Ito M. Tsurukami H. Nakamura T. Doetschman T. Coffin J.D. Hurley M.M. J. Clin. Investig... 2000; 105: 1085-1093Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to analyze the role of the exported FGF2 18-kDa protein isoform during in vivo bone formation. Systemic administration of the 18-kDa FGF2 isoform to rats was reported to induce extraskeletal effects such as anemia and glomerular hypertrophy (9Wamsley H.L. Iwaniec U.T. Wronski T.J. Toxicol. Pathol... 2005; 33: 577-583Google Scholar). Therefore, another goal of this study was to analyze whether targeted overexpression of 18-kDa FGF2 in bone modulated development of the extraskeletal side effects. To achieve these goals, we generated transgenic mice expressing the human 18-kDa FGF2 isoform under the control of the Col I 3.6-kb 5′-regulatory region of type 1 collagen, resulting in 18-kDa FGF2 expression in cells of immature and mature osteoblast lineage. In addition, we characterized the bone phenotype of mice with selective deletion of the 18-kDa isoform of FGF2 (10Garmy-Susini B. Delmas E. Gourdy P. Zhou M. Bossard C. Bugler B. Bayard F. Krust A. Prats A.C. Doetschman T. Prats H. Arnal J.F. Circ. Res... 2004; 94: 1301-1309Google Scholar). Recent studies reported a role for modulation of Wnt signaling by fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 (FGFR2) and the ligand fibroblast growth factor-1 (FGF-1) in intramembranous bone formation (11Mansukhani A. Ambrosetti D. Holmes G. Cornivelli L. Basilico C. J. Cell Biol... 2005; 168: 1065-1076Google Scholar). However, possible cross-talk between FGF2 and Wnt signaling during postnatal bone formation has not been investigated, so we examined a putative role of the Wnt pathway in the bone anabolic effect mediated by 18-kDa FGF2. Wnt proteins are a family of secreted glycoproteins that play important roles in many biological processes, including skeletal development (12Church V.L. Francis-West P. Int. J. Dev. Biol... 2002; 46: 927-936Google Scholar) as well as postnatal bone formation (13Patel M.S. Karsenty G. N. Engl. J. Med... 2002; 346: 1572-1574Google Scholar, 14Goltzman D. Nat. Rev.

Wnt proteins initiate a signaling cascade by binding to a membrane receptor complex composed of the frizzled (FZD) G protein-coupled receptor that is combined with a low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein to activate downstream signaling pathways (15Krishnan V. Bryant H.U. MacDougald O.A. J. Clin. Investig... 2006; 116: 1202-1209Google Scholar). Wnt signaling is controlled by both extracellular and intracellular proteins (15Krishnan V. Bryant H.U. MacDougald O.A. J. Clin. Investig... 2006; 116: 1202-1209Google Scholar). Secreted FZD-related proteins (sFRPs) are extracellular proteins that are able to bind Wnts or FZD receptors thereby attenuating all Wnt-activated pathways. Published results show that sFRP1 is a negative regulator of trabecular bone mass as demonstrated by increased trabecular bone mineral density in sFRP1-/- mice (16Bodine P.V. Zhao W. Kharode Y.P. Bex F.J. Lambert A.J. Goad M.B. Gaur T. Stein G.S. Lian J.B. Komm B.S. Mol. Endocrinol... 2004; 18: 1222-1237Google Scholar). Interestingly, FGF2 and FGFR signaling were shown to modulate heparin-induced sFRP1 accumulation in the HEK293 cell line (17Zhong X. DeSilva T. Lin L. Bodine P. Bhat R.A. Presman E. Pocas J. Stahl M. Kriz R. J. Biol. Chem... 2007; 282: 20523-20533Google Scholar). Because of the similarities between the Sfrp1-/- and the 18-kDa TgFGF2 mice bone phenotypes, we examined sFRP1 mRNA and protein expression in 18-kDa TgFGF2 and VTg mice as well as mice with selective deletion of the 18-kDa FGF2 isoform. We also examined whether differential expression of sFRP-1 altered β-catenin that is important in osteoblast differentiation. These studies demonstrate that transgenic overexpression of the 18-kDa FGF2 protein isoform increased bone mass and that the increase in bone mass is regulated through modulation of the Wnt pathway. Generation and Identification of Mice Expressing 18-kDa Isoform of Human FGF2—To elucidate the role of the endogenous 18-kDa isoform of FGF2 in a bone-specific manner, we generated a construct, called Col3.6-18-kDa FGF2 isoform IRES-GFPsaph. Col3.6-18-kDa FGF2 isoform IRES-GFPsaph was built by replacing a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fragment in a previously made Col3.6-CAT-IRES-GFPsaph (18Dacic S. Kalajzic I. Visnjic D.

This expression construct is capable of concurrently overexpressing the 18-kDa isoform of FGF2 (3Florkiewicz R.Z. Sommer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1989; 86: 3981-3987Google Scholar, 19Florkiewicz R.Z. Shibata F. Barankiewicz T. Baird A. Gonzalez A.M. Florkiewicz E. Shah N. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Generation of the FGF2 cDNAs was described previously (7Xiao L. Liu P. Sobue T. Lichtler A. Coffin J.D. Hurley M.M. J. Cell. Biochem... 2003; 89: 1291-1301Google Scholar). As control, a Col3.6-IRES/GFP (VTg) construct was also generated. The construct insert was released from Col3.6-IRES/GFP (VTg) or Col3.6-18-kDa FGF2 isoform IRES/GFP (18 kDa) by digestion with AseI and AflII and purified according to standard techniques. Microinjections into the pronucleus of fertilized oocytes were performed at the Gene Targeting and Transgenic Facility at the University of Connecticut Health Center. Founder mice of the F2 (FVBN) strain were mated with wild-type mice to establish individual transgenic lines. Mating heterozygote male with heterozygote female generated homozygote mice. Mice were maintained in a virus- and parasite-free barrier facility under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle at the Gene Targeting and Transgenic Facility and weaned at 21 days of age onto autoclaved rodent chow. Mice were sacrificed by CO2 narcosis and cervical dislocation. The University of Connecticut Health Center, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal protocols. For all the transgenic experiments presented, 4.5-month-old homozygote (HO) male mice were used except where noted. Isoform-specific 18-kDa KO Mice—A variation on the Tag and Exchange strategy was used to introduce a 4-bp change that replaced the methionine translational start site encoding CCATGG NcoI restriction site with an alanine-encoding CTGCAG PstI restriction site. No residual genetic modifications such as antibiotic resistance/marker genes or LoxP recombination recognition sites were present in the targeted allele. Examination of tissues of 18-kDa KO mice revealed only expression of the high molecular mass 21- and 22-kDa FGF2 isoforms compared with their WT littermates that expressed all three mouse FGF isoforms of 18, 21, and 22 kDa. Development of these mice has been previously described in detail (10Garmy-Susini B. Delmas E. Gourdy P. Zhou M. Bossard C. Bugler B. Bayard F. Krust A. Prats A.C. Doetschman T. Prats H. Arnal J.F. Circ. Res... 2004; 94: 1301-1309Google Scholar). To further elucidate the role of the endogenous 18-kDa FGF2 isoform in bone, wild type and 18-kDa homozygote knock-out littermates were used in this study. Reporter Assays—The expression of GFP reporter gene in transfectants was detected under fluorescent microscopy. GFP expression in cell was visualized using an Olympus IX50 inverted system microscope equipped with an IX-FLA inverted reflected light fluorescence (Olympus America, Inc., Melville, NY). A specific excitation wavelength was obtained using filters for GFPsaph (exciter, D395/40; dichroic, 425DCLP; emitter, D510/40 m) and recorded with a SPOT camera (Diagnostic Instrument, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). Fluorescent images were taken with equal exposure times applied to bones derived from different transgenic constructs. Genotyping—Genomic DNA was extracted from the tails of heterozygote mice using standard techniques. Transgenes were confirmed by PCR. The presence of the GFP gene was detected by PCR using a set of primers from the middle region of the GFP, 5-TCATCTGCACCACCGGCAAGC-3 and 5-AGCAGGACCATGTGATCGCGC-3, which yield a fragment of 525 bp. PCR was performed in a final volume of 50 μl containing 0.2 g of DNA and 1.25 units of TaqDNA polymerase, 1.25 mm 4dNTP mix; 5 μl of amplification buffer, 1.5 μl of 50 mm CaCl2, 10 μl primers, 20-40 pmol of each. PCR was conducted using standard conditions on an GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Brinkman Instruments Ltd., Westbury, NY) as follows: 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 40 s. Prior to the first cycle, initial denaturation was performed at 94 °C for 3 min, and the last cycle was followed by an extension step of 5 min at 72 °C. The amplification products were evidenced through 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and observed under UV light. Dual Beam X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA)—Femurs, tibiae, and vertebrae were harvested and stored in 70% ethanol at 4 °C. BMD and bone mineral content (BMC) were measured using a Piximus Mouse 11 densitometer (GE Medical Systems, Madison, WI). Micro-CT Scanning of Femurs—After measuring the BMD and BMC, the femurs were analyzed by micro-CT system (μCT-20, Scanco Medical, Zurich), as reported previously (20Ruegsegger P. Koller B.

Using two-dimensional data from scanned slices, three-dimensional analysis was performed to calculate morphometric indices, including bone volume density (bone volume (BV)/tissue volume (TV)), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th = 2 × BV/bone surface). These parameters were calculated by the parallel plate model of Parfitt et al. (21Parfitt A.M. Mathews C.H. Villanueva A.R. Kleerekoper M. Frame B. Rao D.S. J. Clin. Investig... 1983; 72: 1396-1409Google Scholar). The structure model index (SMI), which reflects the degree of normal plate-like trabeculae versus abnormal rod-like trabeculae, was also determined as described previously (22Hildebrand T. Ruegsegger P. Comput. Methods. Biomech. Biomed. Engin... 1997; 1: 15-23Google Scholar). Tissue Preparation for Histology—For histological analysis, mice expressing VTg and 18-kDa transgenes were sacrificed by CO2 narcosis and cervical dislocation. Following euthanasia, the femurs and other tissue samples were removed and immediately fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. After processing each sample was embedded in Shandon Cryomatrix (Thermo Electron Corp., Pittsburgh, PA) and completely frozen. In selected cases, femurs were decalcified in 20% EDTA in PBS for 2 days, and paraffin blocks were prepared by standard procedures. Paraffin or frozen samples were cut into 5-μm sections. The sections were stained with von Kossa. For immunohistochemistry staining, sFRP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) antibody was used at 1:200 dilution following product protocol. Mouse Bone Marrow Cultures—Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were isolated using a modification of previously published methods (8Montero A. Okada Y. Tomita M. Ito M. Tsurukami H. Nakamura T. Doetschman T. Coffin J.D. Hurley M.M. J. Clin. Investig... 2000; 105: 1085-1093Google Scholar). Tibiae and femurs from VTg and 18-kDa mice or from WT and FGF2lmw-/- mice were dissected free of adhering tissue. Bone ends were removed, and the marrow cavity was flushed with α-minimum Eagle's medium by slowly injecting medium into one end of the bone using a sterile 25-gauge needle. Marrow cells were collected into tubes washed twice with serum-free α-minimum Eagle's medium. BMSCs were plated in 6-multiwell plates (2 × 106 cells/well) in αMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS and on day 3 changed to differentiation medium, and cultures were fed every 3 days by replacing 80% of the medium with fresh medium. BMSCs for ALP or xylenol orange staining were harvested on days 7, 14, and 21 of culture. ALP staining was performed with a commercial kit (Sigma). Dishes were scanned and then counterstained for mineral by the von Kossa method as described previously (8Montero A. Okada Y. Tomita M. Ito M. Tsurukami H. Nakamura T. Doetschman T. Coffin J.D. Hurley M.M. J. Clin. Investig... 2000; 105: 1085-1093Google Scholar). mRNA Isolation and Gene Expression—Total RNA was extracted from BMSCs or shaft of flushed long bone by using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. For real time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis, RNA was reverse-transcribed by the Super-Script™ first-strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was carried out using the QuantiTect™ SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen) on a MyiQ™ instrument (Bio-Rad). β-Actin was used as an internal reference for each sample. Using a formula described previously (23Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res... 2001; 29: e45Google Scholar), the relative change in mRNA was normalized against the β-actin mRNA level. RNA Interference—BMSCs were transfected with sFRP-1 siRNA that is able to down-regulate the sFrp1 gene in living cells by introducing a homologous double-stranded RNA. A control siRNA (scrambled sequence) was used as a negative control. The siRNA transfection was performed according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection and were used for ALP activity assay and/or RNA extraction. The specificity of the silencing was confirmed in three different experiments by real time PCR. Transient Transfections—To determine changes in β-catenin trans-activating activity, bone marrow stromal cells were cultured to 70% confluence in 24-well dishes and transiently transfected with the TOP-flash reporter construct using Lipofectamine reagent and PLUS reagent (25 μl Lipofectamine reagent/160 ng of TOP-flash DNA/80 ng of cytomegalovirus 5′-regulatory region DNA) according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Cotransfection with a construct containing the cytomegalovirus 5′-regulatory region driving the β-galactosidase gene (a gift from Dr. Anne M, Delany, University of Connecticut) was used to control for transfection efficiency. Cells were exposed to the Lipofectamine Reagent/PLUS Reagent/DNA mix for 3 h, transferred to regular medium for 48 h, washed twice with PBS, and harvested in a reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured using an Optocomp luminometer (MGM Instruments, Hamden, CT). Luciferase activity was corrected for β-galactosidase activity to control for transfection efficiency. Western Blot Analysis—The expression of FGF2 isoform protein was determined by Western blot. Briefly, protein was extracted using 1× cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA), and total protein concentration was assayed with BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). After SDS-PAGE on 10-20% gels, proteins were transferred to Immobilon™ transfer membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked overnight in TBS-T containing 5% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-FGF2 antibody that recognizes all isoforms of FGF2 (BD Biosciences) for 1 h, washed 1 h with TBS-T, and then incubated with a rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) in TBS-T, 1% nonfat milk for 1 h. After incubation with antibodies, membranes were washed 1 h with TBS-T. Western Lightning™ chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences and GE Healthcare) was used for detection. Band density was quantified by densitometry. The membranes were striped and re-probed for sFPR1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) or β-catenin (BD Biosciences). Biochemistry—Blood was collected from euthanized animals by cardiac puncture. After clotting, the blood was spun, and serum was collected for analysis. Serum phosphate and calcium were measured using the FAST 340 phosphorous reagent SET/calcium reagent SET (Eagle Diagnostics, Desoto, TX). Creatinine was measured using QuantiChrom™ creatinine assay kit (DICT-500) (Sigma). Serum FGF2 level was measured using Quantikine®HS human FGF basic immunoassay kit (R & D Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Indirect Immunofluorescence Staining for sFRP1 in BMSCs—BMSC cells from 2-month-old FGF2lmw-/- and WT littermate mice were plated at 2 × 106 cells/well in 6-well dishes containing coverslips and cultured for 2 weeks on coverslips fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. After rinsing twice with PBS, a 1:50 dilution of the rabbit anti-human sFRP1 antibody was added to the cells and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. For control studies, primary antibody was replaced with PBS alone. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) was then applied to the cells at a dilution of 1:60 for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, cells were mounted in 50% glycerol in PBS. The cells were examined and photographed with a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. Statistical Analysis—All results were expressed as means ± S.E. Differences between groups were analyzed using the Student's t test, and differences were considered significant at p values of less than 0.05. For the comparison among multiple groups, analysis of variance was used, and the significant difference was determined by the Bonferroni test (StatView 4.1J Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). Characterization of 18-kDa TgFGF2 Mice—Fig. 1A shows the maps for the vector only and 18-kDa Fgf2 transgenes that were utilized to develop the vector control (VTg) and 18-kDa TgFGF2 mice. Several founder mice were identified and two viable 18-kDa TgFGF2 lines (18-kDa(305) and 18-kDa(308)) carrying the human 18-kDa FGF2 isoform transgene were established. Analysis was performed on HO 18-kDa TgFGF2 mice compared with HO VTg mice as controls unless noted. Since these mice are on an FVB/N background, HO-breeding pairs were maintained to generate sufficient VTg, 18-kDa(305)TgFGF2, and 18-kDa(308)TgFGF2 mice necessary for experimentation. PCR analysis of genomic DNA sample collected from tail samples demonstrated that both lines of 18-kDa TgFGF2 mice carried the transgene, whereas their non-transgenic littermates lacked the transgene (Fig. 1B). Western blot analysis of protein from tissues of 7-day-old (P7) 18-kDa TgFGF2 mice demonstrated high levels of 18-kDa FGF2 in femurs and calvariae compared with VTg controls. Low levels of FGF2 were observed in liver, but other tissues such as kidney and skin did not overexpress 18-kDa FGF2 (Fig. 1C). There was no difference in serum FGF-2 levels between VTg and 18-kDa TgFGF2 mice (Fig. 1E), confirming bone specificity of FGF-2 overexpression. Expression of the 18-kDa FGF2-GFP transgene in vivo was analyzed in frozen undecalcified sections of femurs from 24-day-old male mice (Fig. 1D). GFP expression was seen in bone-forming osteoblasts and osteocytes, which is consistent with observations in other transgenic animals that have been generated using the col3.6 5′-regulatory region construct (18Dacic S. Kalajzic I. Visnjic D. Lichtler A.C. Rowe D.W. J. Bone Miner. Res... 2001; 16: 1228-1236Google Scholar). Osteoblasts expressing the transgene were present on the surface of trabecular bone and on the endosteal surface and periosteal surface of the metaphyseal cortical bone. GFP expression was stronger in osteoblasts found on trabecular surfaces, endosteum, periosteal (supplemental Fig. 1), and in osteocytes of tibiae from 18-kDa TgFGF2 mice. To determine whether there were extra-skeletal side effects from targeted overexpression of 18-kDa FGF2 in bone, hematocrit, serum creatinine, serum calcium, and phosphorus were measured. There were no differences in any of these parameters between VTg and 18-kDa TgFGF2 mice (data not shown). Histologic examination of hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of the kidneys showed that targeted overexpression of 18-kDa FGF2 in bone did not cause enlargement, vacuolation and karyomegaly of podocytes in glomeruli, dilatation and cast formation in tubules, thickening of the media in lobular arteries, or hyperplasia of the epithelium of the papilla and collecting ducts (24Mazue G. Newman A.J. Scampini G. Della Torre P. Hard G.C. Iatropoulos M.J. Williams G.M. Bagnasco S.M. Toxicol. Pathol... 1993; 21: 490-501Google Scholar). We assessed body weight and femoral bone lengths in mice in VTg and 18-kDa TgFGF2 mice. Mean body weights were 27.6 ± 0.6 for VTg mice versus 29.4 ± 0.3 and 29.7 ± 0.3 g for 18-kDa(305) TgFGF2 and 18-kDa(308) TgFGF2 mice, respectively (p < 0.05). Femoral bone lengths were 14.37 ± 0.60 for VTg mice versus 14.87 ± 0.26 and 14.68 ± 0.13 mm for 18-kDa(305)TgFGF2 and 18-kDa(308)TgFGF2, respectively. There were no significant differences in bone lengths; therefore, the overexpression of the 18-kDa FGF2 isoform did not cause dwarfism or shortened femurs. DXA Analysis of BMD and BMC in VTg and 18-kDa TgFGF2 Mice—BMD and BMC were determined by DXA analysis of femurs and tibiae from two independent lines of 18-kDa TgFGF2 mice compared with VTg. Tibial BMD (Fig. 2A) was increased by 16 and 12% in 18-kDa(305)TgFGF2 and 18-kDa(308)TgFGF2 mice, respectively (p < 0.05). Tibial BMC (Fig. 2B) was significantly increased by 29 and 18% in 18-kDa(305)TgFGF2 and 18-kDa(308)TgFGF2 mice, respectively (p < 0.05). Femoral BMD (Fig. 2C) was significantly increased by 8 and 6% in 18-kDa(305)TgFGF2 and 18-kDa(308)TgFGF2 mice, respectively (p < 0.05). Femoral BMC (Fig. 2D) was significantly increased by 22 and 12% in 18-kDa(305)TgFGF2 and 18-kDa(308)TgFGF2 mice, respectively (p < 0.05). Micro-CT Analysis of Femurs from VTg and 18-kDa TgFGF2 Mice—To investigate the structural effects of 18-kDa FGF2 isoform overexpression on different bone compartments, bone micro-architecture was examined in adult mice by micro-CT. Three-dimensional images of the femurs from VTg, 18-kDa(305)TgFGF2, and 18-kDa(308)TgFGF2 mice are shown in Fig. 3A. Structural analysis showed that BV/TV was significantly increased by 19% in 18-kDa(305)TgFGF2 and increased by 24% in 18-kDa(308)TgFGF2 mice (Fig. 3B)(p < 0.05). The SMI describes the normal plate-like structure of bone, the closer to 0 the more plate-like the trabecular structure, and the closer to 3 the more abnormal rod-like the trabeculae. As shown in (Fig. 3C), SMI was significantly decreased by 10 and 12% in 18-kDa(305)TgFGF2 and 18-kDa(308)TgFGF2 mice, respectively (p < 0.05). Trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) (Fig. 3D) was significantly increased by 8 and 13% in 18-kDa(305)TgFGF2 and 18-kDa(308)TgFGF2 mice, respectively, compared with VTg mice (p < 0.05). The effect of 18-kDa FGF2 isoform overexpression on femoral cortical bone was also determined by micro-CT. Segmented bone area (Fig. 3E) was significantly increased by 17 and 15% in 18-kDa(305)TgFGF2 and 18-kDa(308)TgFGF2 mice, respectively, compared with VTg mice (p < 0.05). Circumferential cortical thickness (Fig. 3F) was increased by 7% in both 18-kDa(305)TgFGF2 and 18-kDa(308)TgFGF2 mice (p < 0.05). Circumferential periosteal perimeter (Fig. 3G) was increased by 9 and 7% in 18-kDa(305)TgFGF2 and 18-kDa(308)TgFGF2 mice, respectively, compared with VTg mice (p < 0.05). Circumferential endosteal perimeter (Fi"
https://openalex.org/W2009131973,"Activation of the Aspergillus nidulans transcription factor PacC, which mediates ambient pH regulation of gene expression and is recruited to ESCRT-III by the Vps32-interacting scaffold PalA, involves its ambient pH-dependent C-terminal proteolysis. This reaction is almost certainly catalyzed by the PalB calpain-like protease. Here we show that PalB associates with membranes and interacts specifically and directly with ESCRT-III Vps24. The PalB N-terminal MIT domain and the Vps24 C-terminal MIM motif are necessary and sufficient for this interaction. PalB(DeltaMIT), a mutant PalB lacking the MIT domain is inefficiently recruited to membranes and impaired in PacC proteolytic processing. Notably, membrane recruitment is promoted and PacC processing largely restored by covalent attachment of Vps24 to mutant PalB(DeltaMIT). This is the first reported evidence that calpain-like recruitment to ESCRT-III lattices plays a physiological role. It unambiguously positions the calpain-like protease PalB within the ESCRT-III-associated pH signaling complex, underlines the positive role of ESCRT-III in ambient pH signal transduction, and suggests a possible mechanism for PalB activation."
https://openalex.org/W2042540266,"ABCA4 is an ATP-binding cassette transporter that is expressed in rod and cone photoreceptor cells and implicated in the removal of retinal derivatives from outer segments following photoexcitation. Mutations in the ABCA4 gene are responsible for a number of related retinal degenerative diseases, including Stargardt macular degeneration, cone-rod dystrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, and age-related macular degeneration. In order to determine the role of the C terminus of ABCA4 in protein structure and function and understand mechanisms by which C-terminal mutations cause retinal degenerative diseases, we have expressed and purified a series of deletion and substitution mutants of ABCA4 and ABCA1 in HEK 293T cells for analysis of their cellular localization and biochemical properties. Removal of the C-terminal 30 amino acids of ABCA4, including a conserved VFVNFA motif, resulted in a loss in N-retinylidene-phosphatidylethanolamine substrate binding, ATP photoaffinity labeling, and retinal-stimulated ATPase activity. This mutant was also retained in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells. Replacement of the VFVNFA motif with alanine residues also resulted in loss in function and cellular mislocalization. In contrast, C-terminal deletion mutants that retain the VFVNFA motif were functionally active and localized to intracellular vesicles similar to wild-type ABCA4. Our studies indicated that the VFVNFA motif is required for the proper folding of ABCA4 into a functionally active protein. This motif also contributes to the efficient folding of ABCA1 into an active protein. Our results provide a molecular based rationale for the disease phenotype displayed by individuals with mutations in the C terminus of ABCA4.

Finally, individuals heterozygous for selected disease-linked mutations in ABCA4 have been suggested to be at higher risk in developing age-related macular degeneration (20Allikmets R. Shroyer N.F.

Disease-associated mutations are distributed throughout the ABCA4 gene and comprise missense, splice site, and nonsense mutations as well as small deletion and insertions resulting in a truncated protein. Biochemical studies indicate that disease-linked mutations in ABCA4 cause complete or partial loss in retinal-stimulated ATPase activity (21Sun H. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Nat.

ABCA4 and ABCA1 are over 50% identical in amino acid sequence. Both proteins have a similar topological organization consisting of two tandem halves, each containing a transmembrane segment followed by a large extracellular domain, a membrane-spanning domain, and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) (24Bungert S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 23539-23546Google Scholar, 25Fitzgerald M.E. Tolley E. Frase S. Zagvazdin Y. Miller R.F. Hodos W. Reiner A. Vis. Neurosci.. 2001; 18: 299-317Google Scholar). In addition, both transporters contain an extended C-terminal tail of about 170 amino acids in length downstream from the NBD in the C-terminal half (NBD2). The importance of the C terminus is underscored by the finding that a mutation in ABCA4, which causes the removal of the C-terminal 30 amino acids of ABCA4, is responsible for cone-rod dystrophy (26Stenirri S. Battistella S. Fermo I. Manitto M.P. Martina E. Brancato R. Ferrari M. Cremonesi L. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med.. 2006; 44: 533-537Google Scholar) and a mutation leading to the deletion of the C-terminal 46 amino acids of ABCA1 is associated with Tangiers disease, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by a loss in circulating high density lipoprotein and accumulation of cholesterol esters in peripheral tissues (27Brousseau M.E.

Their studies suggest that a conserved VFVNFA motif present in the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of ABCA1 interacts with an unknown cytoplasmic protein to orchestrate the binding of apoA-I to ABCA1 and efflux of cholesterol from cells. The VFVNFA motif is also present within the C-terminal 30 amino acids of ABCA4, but its role in this transporter has not been determined. In this paper, we have characterized a number of C-terminal deletion and substitution mutants of ABCA4, including mutants known to cause cone-rod dystrophy and Stargardt macular degeneration (26Stenirri S.

Martina E. Manitto M.P. Brancato R. Dean M. Allikmets R. Cremonesi L. Hum. Genet.. 2001; 109: 326-338Google Scholar). Our studies indicate that the VFVNFA motif present within the 30 C-terminal amino acids plays a crucial role in the folding of ABCA4 into a functionally active protein. Reagents—All-trans-retinal and ATP were purchased from Sigma; CHAPS detergent was from Anatrace (Maumee, OH); and lipids, including brain polar lipids, dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Extracti-Gel D detergent removal gel was obtained from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL), and 8-azidoadenosine 5′-[α-32P]triphosphate was a product of ALT Bioscience (Lexington, KY). All-trans-retinal and all-trans-retinol were radiolabeled and isolated as described by Garwin and Saari (30Garwin G.G. Saari J.C. Methods Enzymol.. 2000; 316: 313-324Google Scholar). Solutions—The compositions of buffers were as follows: hypotonic buffer, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5; column buffer, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.32 mg/ml dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, and 0.32 mg/ml dioleoylphosphatidylcholine; reconstitution buffer: 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.14 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol; solubilization buffer, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 18 mm CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.32 mg/ml dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, and 0.32 mg/ml dioleoylphosphatidylcholine. All-trans-retinal concentration in ethanol was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 42,900 m-1 cm-1. Monoclonal Antibodies and DNA Constructs—The Rim 3F4 monoclonal antibody directed against a defined epitope near the C terminus of ABCA4 and the Rho 1D4 monoclonal antibody to the 9-amino acid C-terminal sequence of rhodopsin have been described previously (2Illing M. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem.. 1997; 272: 10303-10310Google Scholar, 31MacKenzie D. Arendt A. Hargrave P. McDowell J.H. Molday R.S. Biochemistry.. 1984; 23: 6544-6549Google Scholar, 32Hodges R.S. Heaton R.J. Parker J.M. Molday L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem.. 1988; 263: 11768-11775Google Scholar). The purified Rho 1D4 antibody was purchased from UBC-UILO (available on the World Wide Web). C-terminal deletion mutants of ABCA4 containing an added 9-amino acid 1D4 tag (-TETSQVAPA) were generated by PCR using 1) the human ABCA4-1D4 in the pCEP4 plasmid (Invitrogen) as a template; 2) a common forward primer that anneals between nucleotide positions 5808 and 5831 and contains an AflII site; and 3) unique reverse primers that anneal between nucleotides 6778 and 6795 (ABCA4-Δ8-1D4), 6751 and 6771 (ABCA4-Δ16-1D4), 6726 and 6747 (ABCA4-Δ24-1D4), and 6710 and 6729 (ABCA4-Δ30-1D4) and contain an NheI site and the sequence for 1D4 tag. C-terminal deletion mutants of ABCA1 were also generated by PCR using human ABCA1-1D4 in the pCEP4 plasmid as the template, a common forward primer that anneals between nucleotide 6221 and 6239 of ABCA1 with a BamHI site, and unique reverse primers that anneal to nucleotide 6689–6711 (ABCA1-Δ24-1D4), 6642–6663 (ABCA1-Δ40-1D4), and 6625–6645 (ABCA1-Δ46-1D4) and contain a BamHI site and the sequence for the 1D4 tag. Chimera constructs ABCA4/A1 with the C terminus of ABCA4 replaced with the C terminus of ABCA1 just after the VFVNFA motif and ABCA1/A4 in which the C terminus of ABCA1 was replaced with the C terminus of ABCA4 were generated by overlapping PCR. Alanine substitution mutants (ABCA4-Ala6 and ABCA1-Ala6) in which the VFVNFA motif in ABCA4 and ABCA1 were replaced with 6 alanine residues (VFVNFA → AAAAAA) were generated by overlapping PCR. Expression of WT and Mutant ABCA4 and ABCA1 in HEK 293T Cells and Extraction of Membrane Proteins—HEK 293-T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1.25 μg/ml fungizone. Typically, each 10-cm dish of cells at 30% confluence was transfected with 20 μg of plasmid DNA using calcium phosphate (33Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell Biol.. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar). After 48 h, cells from two or three plates were harvested in 1.5 ml of hypotonic buffer. Membranes from homogenates of transfected cells were prepared as described previously (24Bungert S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 23539-23546Google Scholar) but in a smaller scale. Briefly, the cell homogenate from two or three 10-cm dishes was passed five times through a 26-gauge needle and subsequently applied to a step gradient consisting of 5 and 60% (w/v) sucrose. Centrifugation was carried out for 30 min at 77,000 × g in a TLS 55 swing bucket (Optima TL Ultracentrifuge, Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). Membranes at the interface between the 5 and 60% layers were collected, pelleted at 100,000 × g, and resuspended at a concentration of 5 mg of protein/ml in buffer consisting of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. To compare extractability of the expressed 1D4-tagged ABCA4 mutants, 20 μl of membranes was added to 180 μl of CHAPS solubilization buffer at 4 °C. The mixture was stirred for 20 min and subsequently centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min in a TLA55 rotor (Beckman). The supernatant fraction (20 μl) was mixed with 4× SDS loading buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE for analysis by Western blotting. To determine the total expression level of each mutant, 2 μl of membranes was mixed with 18 μl of water, 10 μl4× SDS loading buffer, and resolved by SDS-PAGE for quantification by Western blotting. Analysis of Retinoid Binding—Solid phase binding assay using [3H]-labeled all-trans-retinal was carried out as described previously (7Beharry S. Zhong M. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 53972-53979Google Scholar). All incubations were carried out at 4 °C. Briefly, transfected HEK 293T cells harvested from one dish were centrifuged at 2800 × g for 3 min and resuspended in 0.5 ml of solubilization buffer. The supernatant fraction obtained after centrifugation (100,000 × g for 10 min) was incubated with 12.5 μl of Rho 1D4-Sepharose 2B immunoaffinity matrix pre-equilibrated in column buffer. After 1 h, the matrix containing the bound 1D4-tagged protein was washed several times with 0.4 ml of column buffer by low speed centrifugation and mixed with 0.25 ml of 20 μm3H-labeled all-trans-retinal (specific activity of 500 dpm/pmol, 2.5 × 106 dpm total) in column buffer for 30 min. The matrix was washed several times with 0.4 ml of column buffer to remove unbound 3H-labeled all-trans-retinal and then incubated in the presence or absence of 0.5 mm ATP for 15 min. The matrix was washed two more times with 0.4 ml of column buffer before being transferred to Ultrafree-MC (0.45-μm filter) spin column (Millipore). The samples containing the immobilized 1D4-tagged ABCA4 proteins with bound labeled retinoid were washed three more times before extracting the 3H-labeled all-trans-retinal from the matrix with 0.5 ml of ice-cold ethanol for 15 min at room temperature by centrifugation. Radiolabeled all-trans-retinal in the ethanol extractions was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Assays were carried out in triplicate for each point determination. In general, the procedures were carried out under dim light to prevent any photoreaction of the retinoids. 1D4-tagged Na,K-ATPase was treated in the same way and used as a control to monitor for background retinoid binding. The counts in the controls, typically about 20% of the test sample not treated of ATP, were subtracted from the test samples to determine specific retinoid binding. A duplicate column eluted with 60 μl of 1% SDS was used to determine the amount of 1D4-tagged protein immobilized on Rho 1D4-Sepharose affinity matrix. Reconstitution in Lipid Vesicles—For ATPase assays, 2–3 dishes of transfected HEK 293T cells were solubilized as described for retinoid binding studies. The solubilized protein was incubated with 25 μl of Rim 3F4 or Rho 1D4-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C in an Ultrafree-MC spin column. The matrix was washed six times with 0.4 ml of column buffer to remove unbound protein. The matrix was then incubated with 37.5 μl of 0.2 mg/ml competing peptide (3F4 (YDLPLHPRTA) or 1D4 (TETSQVAPA) peptide) in column buffer at 7 °C for 20 min. The addition of peptide and elution was repeated, and two eluates were combined. The eluted ABCA4 proteins were reconstituted into brain polar lipids using the procedure of Sun et al. (6Sun H. Molday R.S. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 8269-8281Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 9 μl of 25 mg/ml sonicated brain polar lipid extract (33% PE, 18% phosphatidylserine, 13% phosphatidylcholine, 4.1% phosphatidylinositol, 31% other lipids) was mixed with 6 μl of 15% n-octyl glucoside (w/v) in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol. Purified ABCA4 protein (60 μl) was added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 30 min. Reconstitution buffer (180 μl) was added rapidly, and the sample was then passed through 400 μl of Extracti-gel resin pre-equilibrated with reconstitution buffer in a Mobicol minicolumn fitted with a 10-μm pore size filter (MoBiTec, Gottingen, Germany). The flow-through containing reconstituted ABCA4 or ABCA1 protein was collected at 0.8 ml/min by applying gentle pressure with a syringe, and 5 mm MgCl2 was added prior to carrying out ATPase activity measurements. ATPase Assay—ATP assays were carried out using [α-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and thin layer chromatography as previously described (34Ahn J. Wong J.T. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 20399-20405Google Scholar). ATPase assays were carried out in a 10-μl total reaction volume consisting of 8 μl (20–40 ng) of reconstituted protein and 1 μl of 10× retinoid or buffer. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 μl of a 10× ATP solution (0.2 μCi) to achieve a final concentration of 50 μm. After 30 min at 37 °C, 4 μl of 10% SDS was added. One μl of the reaction mixture was spotted onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose plate (Sigma) and chromatographed in 0.5 m LiCl, 1 m formic acid. The plate was exposed to a storage phosphor screen for 3 h and scanned in a Typhoon Variable Mode Imager (GE Healthcare). Spots corresponding to ATP and ADP were quantified using ImageQuant TL software (Amersham Biosciences). The ratio of the amount of ADP produced to the initial amount of ATP present in the reaction mixture was calculated. Each sample was assayed in triplicate. Buffer blanks were included to determine nonenzymatic ATP hydrolysis, which was subtracted from the total ATP hydrolyzed. Protein Determination—The amount of protein in detergent extracts and reconstituted vesicles was determined by comparing the intensity of Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of ABCA4 with that of standard amounts of bovine serum albumin after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon FL membranes (Millipore) at 13 V for 30 min in a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad) using a buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 10% methanol, pH 8.3. The membranes were blocked with 0.5% skim milk in PBS (140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.4) for 30 min, rinsed, and incubated with Rho 1D4 monoclonal antibody diluted in 0.5% milk, PBS for 1 h. After extensive washing in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST), the membranes were treated for 30 min with secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse Ig conjugated with IRDye 680 (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE), diluted 1:10,000 in 0.5% milk, 0.02% SDS, PBST) and washed in PBST prior to analysis with a LI-COR infrared imaging system. Photoaffinity Labeling of ABCA4—Five μl of membrane protein (25 μg protein) in resuspension buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) was mixed with 15 μl of 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (4.5 μm, 0.05 mCi/ml) in the same buffer. The sample was immediately exposed to 254-nm UV light at a distance of 10 cm for 10 min. SDS sample buffer (10 μl) was mixed with each sample without heating, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Triplicate cell expression samples were carried out for each mutant. The same amount of unlabeled membranes was resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting analysis for protein quantification. Immunofluorescence Labeling of Cells—HEK293T cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected with the plasmid using calcium phosphate. After 24 h, the cells were washed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer and fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer at 22 °C. Cells were then blocked and permeabilized for 30 min at 22 °C in the same buffer containing 10% (v/v) normal goat serum and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. For single labeling experiments, the cells were treated with the Rho 1D4 antibody for 1 h at 22 °C, washed in PBS buffer, and treated with goat anti-mouse Ig-coupled Cy3 diluted 1:1000 in phosphate buffer and counterstained with the nuclear dye 4′,6-diamido-2-phenylindole. For double labeling studies, ABCA4 protein was labeled with Rho 1D4 followed by goat anti-mouse Ig conjugated to Alexa 488, and calnexin was labeled with a rabbit anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody followed by goat anti-rabbit Ig conjugated to Alexa 594. Immunofluorescence labeling was visualized using a Meta 510 Zeiss confocal microscope or a Zeiss Axioplan 2 fluorescence microscope. C-terminal 1D4 Tag Does Not Affect the ATPase Activity of ABCA4—In previous studies, the Rim 3F4 monoclonal antibody coupled to Sepharose was used to purify ABCA4 from bovine rod outer segments and recombinant ABCA4 from transfected cells for structure-function studies (2Illing M. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem.. 1997; 272: 10303-10310Google Scholar, 6Sun H. Molday R.S. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 8269-8281Google Scholar, 7Beharry S. Zhong M. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem.. 2004; 279: 53972-53979Google Scholar, 21Sun H. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Nat. Genet.. 2000; 26: 242-246Google Scholar, 34Ahn J. Wong J.T. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 20399-20405Google Scholar). Since the 3F4 epitope is located close to the C terminus (amino acids 2252–2262) of ABCA4, the Rim 3F4 antibody cannot be used to purify ABCA4 C-terminal deletion mutants for biochemical studies. To circumvent this problem, we have added a 9-amino acid 1D4 tag to the C terminus of WT and mutant ABCA4. This tag recognized by the Rho 1D4 monoclonal antibody (31MacKenzie D. Arendt A. Hargrave P. McDowell J.H. Molday R.S. Biochemistry.. 1984; 23: 6544-6549Google Scholar) has been shown previously to be extremely effective for the immunoaffinity purification of membrane proteins for structure-function studies (35Oprian D.D. Molday R.S. Kaufman R.J. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1987; 84: 8874-8878Google Scholar, 36Loewen C.J. Moritz O.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem.. 2001; 276: 22388-22396Google Scholar). First, it was necessary to determine if the addition of the 1D4 tag has any effect on the biochemical properties of ABCA4. This was determined by expressing ABCA4 and ABCA4-1D4 in HEK 293T cells and purifying the proteins from CHAPS-solubilized membranes on a Rim 3F4-Sepharose immunoaffinity matrix (Fig. 1, A and B). Both proteins expressed at similar levels and were solubilized to the same extent in CHAPS detergent. Elution of the proteins bound to the immunoaffinity matrix with the 3F4 peptide yielded similar amounts of highly pure 250-kDa ABCA4 as quantified on SDS gels stained with Coomassie Blue. After reconstitution into brain lipid vesicles, both ABCA4 and ABCA4-1D4 displayed similar basal and all-trans-retinal-stimulated ATPase activities (Fig. 1C). The basal activities for ABCA4 and ABCA4-1D4 were 54.3 ± 0.9 and 48.9 ± 2.5 nmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein, respectively. HEK 293T cells transfected with vector alone were used in control studies. No contaminating proteins or ATPase activity was observed when the detergent-solubilized extract from these cells was passed through either a Rim 3F4 or Rho 1D4 immunoaffinity column (data not shown). These results indicate that the C-terminal 1D4 tag does not affect the expression, purification, or enzymatic activity of ABCA4, and the basal and retinal-stimulated ATPase activities are solely due to expressed ABCA4. 1D4-tagged ABCA4 and ABCA1 Mutants—To investigate the importance of the C terminus on the biochemical properties of ABCA4, we generated four C-terminal deletion mutants, one C-terminal chimera mutant (ABCA4/A1) in which the C-terminal 24-amino acid segment of ABCA4 was replaced with the C-terminal 40-amino acid segment of ABCA1, and one C-terminal mutant in which a conserved VFVNFA motif was replaced with 6 alanine residues (ABCA4-Ala6) (Fig. 2). Several related ABCA1 mutants were also constructed for comparative studies. The WT and mutant proteins contained a 1D4 C-terminal tag for detection and purification. For simplicity, we have omitted 1D4 in the designation of the various ABCA4 proteins used in this study. The Effect of C-terminal Deletions on the Expression and Solubilization of ABCA4—The level of expression of WT ABCA4 and the various mutants was determined by directly solubilizing membranes from HEK 293T cells in SDS for analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 3A). The WT and mutants migrated as tightly spaced doublets, presumably arising from differential posttranslational processing of the proteins. The level of expression of the mutants was typically within 75% that of WT ABCA4 with the exception of ABCA4-Δ24, which expressed at only 40% of WT ABCA4. The ability of CHAPS to effectively solubilize the ABCA4 mutants from HEK 293T cell membranes was also investigated. Fig. 3B shows that all CHAPS-solubilized mutants migrated as a sharp single band but at variable levels. The single bands suggest that CHAPS solubilized only a single class of ABCA4 proteins, presumably nonaggregated proteins having a native-like structure. ABCA4-Δ8 was solubilized in CHAPS at a level comparable with WT ABCA4,"
https://openalex.org/W2170760765,"The Extracellular Regulated Kinase 1 and 2 transduce a variety of extracellular stimuli regulating processes as diverse as proliferation, differentiation and synaptic plasticity. Once activated in the cytoplasm, ERK1 and ERK2 translocate into the nucleus and interact with nuclear substrates to induce specific programs of gene expression. ERK1/2 share 85% of aminoacid identity and all known functional domains and thence they have been considered functionally equivalent until recent studies found that the ablation of either ERK1 or ERK2 causes dramatically different phenotypes. To search a molecular justification of this dichotomy we investigated whether the different functions of ERK1 and 2 might depend on the properties of their cytoplasmic-nuclear trafficking. Since in the nucleus ERK1/2 is predominantly inactivated, the maintenance of a constant level of nuclear activity requires continuous shuttling of activated protein from the cytoplasm. For this reason, different nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of ERK1 and 2 would cause a differential signalling capability. We have characterised the trafficking of fluorescently tagged ERK1 and ERK2 by means of time-lapse imaging in living cells. Surprisingly, we found that ERK1 shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm at a much slower rate than ERK2. This difference is caused by a domain of ERK1 located at its N-terminus since the progressive deletion of these residues converted the shuttling features of ERK1 into those of ERK2. Conversely, the fusion of this ERK1 sequence at the N-terminus of ERK2 slowed down its shuttling to a similar value found for ERK1. Finally, computational, biochemical and cellular studies indicated that the reduced nuclear shuttling of ERK1 causes a strong reduction of its nuclear phosphorylation compared to ERK2, leading to a reduced capability of ERK1 to carry proliferative signals to the nucleus. This mechanism significantly contributes to the differential ability of ERK1 and 2 to generate an overall signalling output."
https://openalex.org/W2042030551,"Inhalant allergens from cockroaches are an important cause of asthma to millions of individuals worldwide. Here we report for the first time the structures of two major cockroach allergens, Bla g 4 and Per a 4, that adopt a typical lipocalin fold but with distinct structural features as compared with other known lipocalin allergens. Both Bla g 4 and Per a 4 contain two long-range disulfide bonds linking the N and C termini to a β-barrel. The C-terminal helix of Bla g 4 is bent and greatly extended toward the N terminus. Bla g 4 is found to be a monomer, whereas Per a 4 exists as a dimer in solution with a novel dimeric interface involving residues from loops at the top and bottom of the β-barrel. Putative ligand binding sites of both allergens are determined by docking of the juvenile hormone III inside the β-barrel and found to interact with the ligand using non-conserved residues. Bla g 4 and Per a 4 are found to be cross-reactive in sera IgE binding, at least in the Singaporean Chinese population tested. A major IgE binding epitope unique to Per a 4 is found on the loops at the bottom of the β-barrel that may aid the development of hypoallergens for immunotherapy.

Rising incidence of asthma and other allergy-related diseases has been one of the major healthcare concerns worldwide. The great importance of these diseases has lead to the isolation and identification of many allergenic proteins involved in eliciting inflammation responses. Allergens bind to IgE antibodies and cross-link their receptors on mast cells, subsequently causing the release of histamine and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. Despite the identification of many allergens from several different sources, the characterization and epitope mapping studies on all these proteins yet remain limited. Consequently, the basis of the IgE binding of many of these allergens also remains unknown. Inhalant allergens from cockroaches have been recognized for the last 30 years as an important cause of asthma. Sensitization to cockroach allergens is a major risk factor, especially due to the high levels of these proteins found in the urban environment (1Eggleston P.A. Rosenstreich D. Lynn H. Gergen P. Baker D. Kattan M. Mortimer K.M. Mitchell H. Ownby D. Slavin R. Malveaux F. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol... 1998; 102: 563-570Google Scholar). It has been reported that 44% of the 755 allergy clinic patients living in New York responded positive in skin tests to cockroach allergens (2Bernton H. Brown H. J. Allergy.. 1964; 35: 506-513Google Scholar). In Singapore, sensitization rates among patients with asthma and/or allergic rhinitis to cockroaches are 56.4% (Blattella germanica) and 59.5% (Periplaneta americana), second only to the dust mite (3Chew F.T. Lim S.H. Goh D.Y.T. Lee B.W. Allergy.. 1999; 54: 1150-1159Google Scholar). Both species of domestic cockroaches produce several potent allergens, including Bla g 1 and Per a 1 (food intake and digestion); Bla g 2 and Per a 2 (inactive aspartic protease); Per a 3 (arylphorin-like storage protein); Bla g 4 and Per a 4 (male pheromone transport lipocalin); Bla g 5 and Per a 5 (glutathione S-transferase); Bla g 6 and Per a 6 (troponin C); and Bla g 7 and Per a 7 (tropomyosin) (4Gore J.C. Schal C. Annu. Rev. Entomol... 2007; 52: 439-463Google Scholar). The prevalence of serum IgE antibody to recombinant Bla g 4 in 73 cockroach allergic patients with asthma ranged from 40 to 60%, indicating that it is a major allergen (5Arruda L.K. Vailes L.D.

Bla g 4 belongs to a family of protein known as lipocalin, a group of small extracellular ligand-binding proteins (6Arruda L.K. Vailes L.D. Hayden M.L. Benjamin D.C. Chapman M.D. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 31196-31201Google Scholar). Typically, members of the lipocalin protein family exhibit greatly diverse protein sequence similarities but all of them contain a highly conserved overall protein structure (7Flower D.R. Biochem.

Nature.. 1992; 360: 186-188Google Scholar). Although several crystal structures of these lipocalins have been determined, exact IgE epitope residues of these allergens are not well understood. Consequently, the basis of allergenicity of lipocalin allergens remains unknown. Previously, we have isolated the cDNA of variants of Bla g and Per a 4, from the expressed sequence tag (EST) library of B. germanica and P. americana, respectively. 6F. T. Chew, H. S. Shang, and Q. R. Pan, unpublished data. Here we report the crystal structures of variants of two allergenic lipocalins, Bla g 4 and Per a 4, from cockroaches B. germanica and P. americana, which showed typical lipocalin folds but with distinct structural features. The putative ligand binding site has been identified by docking with the physiological ligand. The cross-reactivity and key IgE binding residues of these two allergens will also be discussed. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Bla g 4 and Per a 4—The gene of a Bla g 4 variant (GenBank accession code 1146297, residues 1-176) or a Per a 4 variant (GenBank accession code 1146802, residues 1-167), both without their intact signal peptides, was subcloned into a modified pET-32a vector (Novagen; with thioredoxin and S-tag removed). BL21 Origami B cells (Novagen) were used for recombinant protein expression. Overnight cultures of the bacterial cells were grown in 2 liters of Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin, 15 μg/ml kanamycin, and 12.5 μg/ml tetracycline. For expression in BL21(DE3) cells, Luria broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin was used. Cultures were induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for overnight expression at 20 °C. Selenomethionine (Se-Met) 7The abbreviations used are: Se-Met, selenomethionine; CCD, charge-coupled device; GA-LS, genetic algorithm with local search; 1H-15N HSQC, 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation; JHIII, juvenile hormone III; PEG, polyethylene glycol; r.m.s. deviation, root mean square deviation; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.-labeled Bla g 4 and Per a 4 were expressed similarly in M9 minimal media supplemented with Se-Met. Both Bla g 4 and Per a 4 were expressed as soluble His-tagged proteins and purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resins (Qiagen). The N-terminal His tag was cleaved using thrombin digestion (3 units/mg, Sigma) and the protein was further purified on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, and 0.2 m NaCl. Proteins were dialyzed overnight against 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, prior to crystallization experiments. Crystallization and Data Collection—Both the native and Se-Met-labeled Bla g 4 were concentrated to 12 mg/ml prior to crystallization, whereas native and Se-Met-labeled Per a 4 were concentrated to 27 mg/ml. Initial crystallization conditions were identified using Hampton Research screens for both proteins. A final crystallization condition was optimized for Bla g 4 to contain 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 m sodium citrate, and 3% acetone. Diffraction quality crystals grew after 7 days at room temperature. Per a 4 crystals grew in 10% PEG 4000, 2 m NaCl, and 3% acetone at room temperature after 3 days. Synchrotron datasets for both protein crystals were processed and scaled using the program HKL2000 (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol.. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—Four selenium sites in the asymmetric unit of Bla g 4 crystals were located by the program Solve (14Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr... 1999; 55: 849-861Google Scholar) and the initial phases were further improved by RESOLVE (15Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr... 1999; 55: 1863-1871Google Scholar). RESOLVE built ∼75% of the molecule. The remaining parts of the model were built manually using the program Coot (16Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr... 2004; 60: 2126-2132Google Scholar). Further cycles of model building alternate with refinement using CNS (17Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr... 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar) resulted in a final model, with reflections I > σI used in the refinement. The model was later refined against the native data of 1.9 Å in resolution. The final model comprised 338 residues in the asymmetric unit (Asn7-Lys135 and Met141-His176 of each monomer) and 179 water molecules were added to the model. PROCHECK (18Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr... 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar) analysis showed >84.5% residues in the most favorable region with 0.7% residues in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. Per a 4 was refined by similar procedures as those for Bla g 4 but with non-crystallographic symmetry restraints used throughout the refinement. The final model comprised of 314 residues (Asp3-Tyr87 and Ser94-Tyr165 of each monomer) with no water molecules added due to the limited resolution. The density from residues Gly88 to Trp93 were not observed and thus not modeled. A well defined density belonging to the PEG molecule was observed in the model. The Ramachandran plot showed 76.6% of residues in the most favorable region with 0.7% residues in the disallowed region. Docking of JH III Ligand on Bla g 4 and Per a 4—The crystal structures of Bla g 4 and Per a 4 were used for docking with JH III using the program Autodock 4.0 (19Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem... 1998; 19: 1639-1662Google Scholar). The initial three-dimensional structure of JH III was generated using the program Discovery Studio 2.0 from Accelrys. Coordinate files of the macromolecule as well as the ligand used for autogrid and autodock calculations were prepared using the program AutoDockTools (19Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem... 1998; 19: 1639-1662Google Scholar). A grid with spacing of 0.375 Å and 74 × 68 × 66 points or spacing of 0.375 Å and 74 × 68 × 80 points were used for Bla g 4 and Per a 4, respectively. The grid center was selected to include all residues in the putative ligand binding cavity. The GA-LS algorithm was adopted using default settings except with the maximum number of generation changed to 500,000 and the maximum number of energy evaluations increased to 25,000,000. For each docking job, 100 hybrid GA-LS runs were carried out. A total of 100 possible binding conformations were generated and grouped into clusters based on a 2.0-Å cluster tolerance. Titration of Bla g 4 and Per a 4 with JH III—JH III (Sigma) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide to a final concentration of 50 mm. Titration studies were carried out using Bla g 4 or Per a 4 at the protein concentration of 0.5 mm and with a final molar ratio of protein:ligand equal to 1:1. HSQC experiments were performed at 308 K and in a buffer containing 20 mm acetate, pH 4.5, for Bla g 4 or 20 mm phosphate, pH 6.0, for Per a 4. Dimethyl sulfoxide alone was titrated into the protein sample as a blank control. IgE binding by Immuno Dot-blot—Sera from 700 consecutive individuals (80% Singaporean Chinese, remaining 14% Malaysians and 6% Indians) with asthma or allergic rhinitis were screened by dot blotting for Bla g 4- and Per a 4-specific IgE responses. For mapping of IgE epitopes, 24 and 32 sera from individuals with positive responses to Bla g 4 and Per a 4 were tested against Bla g 4 or Per a 4 proteins (wild type or mutant). The immuno dot-blot was performed as previously described (20Chan S.L. Ong T.C. Gao Y.F. Tiong Y.S. Wang D.Y. Chew F.T. Mok Y.K. J. Immunol... 2008; 181: 2586-2596Google Scholar). IgE Binding by ELISA—The specific binding of Bla g 4 and Per a 4 (wild type or mutant) to IgE from the serum of a patient was determined to map the IgE binding epitopes. ELISA was performed as previously described (20Chan S.L. Ong T.C. Gao Y.F. Tiong Y.S. Wang D.Y. Chew F.T. Mok Y.K. J. Immunol... 2008; 181: 2586-2596Google Scholar). Cross-inhibition of Bla g 4 and Per a 4 by Competitive ELISA—Microtiter plates (Nunc) were coated with Bla g 4 or Per a 4. Before use, pooled sera from 73 reactive individuals were preabsorbed with serial dilutions of recombinant proteins, Bla g 4 or Per a 4. Competitive ELISA was performed as described previously (21Gao Y.F. Wang D.Y. Ong T.C. Tay S.L. Yap K.H. Chew F.T. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol... 2007; 120: 105-112Google Scholar). Coordinates—Coordinates for the crystal structures of Bla g 4 and Per a 4 have been deposited at the Protein Data bank with accession codes of 3EBK and 3EBW, respectively. Structures of Bla g 4 and Per a 4—The models of Bla g 4 and Per a 4 had been refined and both showed good stereochemical parameters (Table 1 and Fig. 1A). Both Bla g 4 and Per a 4 crystallized with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Bla g 4 and Per a 4 adopted a typical lipocalin fold with an eight-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel (βA to βH) followed by a single C-terminal α-helix that packed against the β-barrel (Fig. 1B). The 9th β-strand (βI) can be found in many lipocalins but was absent in Bla g 4 and Per a 4. In Bla g 4, a short helical segment preceding the βA strand crossed and closed the bottom of the β-barrel, whereas the CD loop and three 310 helices from the AB loop, EF loop, and GH loop surrounded the entrance of the cavity on top of the β-barrel (Fig. 1, B and C). Per a 4 does not have any secondary structural element at loops or N- and C-terminal regions. The bottom of the β-barrel is closed by the loop region preceding the βA and the entrance of the cavity is surrounded by the AB loop, CD loop, and GH loop. The AB loop is much longer, reaching the center of the entrance and, thus, conceivably, acting as a lid for the cavity. The βE strand is especially shortened in Per a 4, making the EF loop to “peel” away from the β-barrel making the entrance to the cavity much more open and accessible as compared with Bla g 4 (Fig. 1, B and C). All lipocalins contain a C-terminal helix that pack on one face of the β-barrel. The most distinct feature of Bla g 4 is that this α-helix is especially longer and bent, whereas the equivalent helix in Per a 4 and other lipocalins are much shorter and straight (Fig. 1B and Fig. 2). This bent α-helix of Bla g 4 has a unique hydrogen bonding pattern. The carbonyl oxygen (C′O) of residues Val150 and Asn151 are both hydrogen-bonded to NH of residue Lys154. The C′O of residue Gln152 does not form a hydrogen bond with NH of Ala156. The NH of residue Lys155 and Ala156, as well as CO′ of Gln152, are left free without forming any hydrogen bonds. Other residues in this α-helix adopt regular hydrogen bonding patterns (CO′ of residue i to NH of residue i+4).TABLE 1Crystallographic data and refinement statisticsNativeBla g 4Per a 4RemotePeakInflectionRemotePeakInflectionData collectionSpace groupP41P41Cell dimensionsa, b, c (Å)a = 60.17a = 63.02b = 60.17b = 63.02c = 124.93c = 143.82α,β,γ (°)α = β = γ = 90α = β = γ = 90Wavelength1.1000.97970.97990.96000.97960.97980.9600Resolution (Å)50.0-1.950.0-2.250.0-2.350.0-2.450.0-2.850.0-2.850.0-2.8(2.0-1.9)(2.3-2.2)(2.4-2.3)(2.5-2.4)(2.9-2.8)(2.9-2.8)(2.9-2.8)Rsym0.064 (0.226)0.069 (0.333)0.077 (0.339)0.085 (0.323)0.047 (0.326)0.046 (0.387)0.040 (0.279)I/σI52.6 (18.0)33.5 (3.5)29.2 (2.1)22.7 (1.3)49.7 (3.4)46.1 (1.5)48.4 (2.9)Completeness (%)99.9 (100.0)100.0 (100.0)100.0 (100.0)99.9 (100.0)100.0 (100.0)99.9 (100.0)99.9 (100.0)Redundancy15.0 (15.0)5.1 (5.1)5.2 (5.1)3.9 (3.9)5.7 (5.7)5.6 (5.5)3.8 (3.8)RefinementResolution (Å)8.0-1.98.0-2.8Rwork (No. of reflections)0.218 (31990)0.231 (23093)Rfree (No. of reflections)0.253 (1676)0.277 (1226)No. atomsProtein27062516Ligand/ion44Water179B-FactorsProtein35.9063.41Ligand/ion40.33Water39.06R.m.s. deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.00910.010Bond angles (°)1.511.55 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Structure-based alignment of Bla g 4 and Per a 4 with lipocalin allergens and endogenous lipocalins. Secondary structures of Bla g 4 and Per a 4 are aligned with those of known lipocalin allergens (Mus m 1, Protein Data Bank code, 1MUP; Rat n 1, Protein Data Bank code, 2A2G; Equ c 1, Protein Data Bank code, 1EW3; Bos d 2, Protein Data Bank code, 1BJ7; and Bos d 5, Protein Data Bank code, 1BEB), and, endogenous lipocalins (human tear lipocalin, Protein Data Bank code, 1XKI; and bilin-binding protein, Protein Data Bank code, 1BBP) using the protein structure comparison service SSM at European Bioinformatics Institute. Note that residues 1-6 and 136-140 of Bla g 4, and residues 1-2, 88-93, and 166-167 of Per a 4, are absent in the structure alignment due to the lack of electron densities at these residues in the electron density map. β-Strands, α-helices, and 310 helices are highlighted in yellow, cyan, and magenta, respectively. Boundaries and types of secondary structures are determined using the program MOLMOL (49Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics.. 1996; 14: 51-55Google Scholar). Three SCRs are boxed with solid black lines and highly conserved residues are in bold face. The pair of cysteine residues involved in the same disulfide bond are boxed and marked in a same color (red, blue, or green). The sequence identity between Bla g 4 and Per a 4 is 21%. Sequence identities between Bla g 4 and Mus m 1, Bos d 2, and Equ c 1 are 17, 10, and 17%, respectively. Sequence identities between Per a 4 and Mus m 1, Bos d 2, and Equ c 1 are 15, 4, and 14%, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Another characteristic structural feature of lipocalins is the long-range disulfide bond that either connects the N and C terminus or just the C terminus of the protein to the β-barrel (Figs. 1C and 2). This is the first report to reveal the simultaneous presence of both disulfide bonds in allergenic lipocalins. Both Bla g 4 and Per a 4 contain two long-range disulfide bonds similar to those found in many non-allergenic lipocalins. One long-range disulfide bond connects the N terminus to the end of βG, whereas the other one connects the start of βB to the C terminus. A similar pattern of long-range disulfide is also observed in many non-allergenic lipocalins like insecticyanin from the tobacco hornworm (22Holden H.M. Rypniewski W.R. Law J.H. Rayment I.

Structure.. 1997; 5: 481-495Google Scholar) contain single long-range disulfide bonds that connect the start of βD to the C terminus. Bla g 4 and Per a 4 share a low sequence identity among them, and with other lipocalins (Fig. 2). Despite the very low sequence identity, there exist some conserved sequence motifs among lipocalins that allow them to be classified (7Flower D.R. Biochem. J... 1996; 318: 1-14Google Scholar, 27Flower D.R. North A.C.T. Sansom C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta.. 2000; 1482: 9-24Google Scholar). Three conserved sequence motifs that are found in the three “structurally conserved regions” (SCR1, SCR2, and SCR3) are GXW, TDYXXY, and Arg, respectively (7Flower D.R. Biochem. J... 1996; 318: 1-14Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Bla g 4 belongs to a kernel lipocalin as it shares all three conserved sequence motifs, whereas Per a 4 is an outlier lipocalin that shares only the GXW and TDYXXY motifs (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 shows the structure-based sequence alignment of selected allergenic and nonallergenic lipocalins using the protein structure comparison service SSM at European Bioinformatics Institute (28Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr... 2004; 60: 2256-2268Google Scholar). Overall, structures of all lipocalins are similar adopting the basic lipocalin fold. However, the C-terminal α-helix of Bla g 4 is extended far toward the N terminus and this region cannot be aligned with other lipocalins (Fig. 2). For comparison of structures, we have overlaid structures of Bla g 4 and Per a 4, and also, with their structurally most homologous nonallergenic and allergenic lipocalins selected based on the DALI search (29Holm L. Sander C. Science.. 1996; 273: 595-602Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Structure superposition was performed using the TopMatch (30Sippl M.J. Wiederstein M. Bioinformatics.. 2008; 24: 426-427Google Scholar) web service. Bla g 4 superimposed with Per a 4 with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.6 Å for Cα atoms of 119 structurally equivalent residues. Main differences are found at the N-terminal part of the bent α-helix of Bla g 4 and residues at the CD, EF, and GH loops located at the entrance of the ligand binding cavity and the C terminus located at the top of the β-barrel (Fig. 3A). A similar pattern has been observed in the superposition of Bla g 4 with the bacterial lipocalin Blc with an r.m.s. deviation of 2.4 Å for Cα atoms of 121 structurally equivalent residues (Fig. 3B). For superposition with Mus m 1, additional regions from βG and βH adjacent to the GH loop cannot be aligned with Bla g 4. The overall number of structurally equivalent residues was reduced to 112 with an r.m.s. deviation of 2.6 Å for Cα atoms (Fig. 3C). Per a 4 superimposed well with the bilin-binding protein with a r.m.s. deviation of 2.6 Å for Cα atoms of 138 structurally equivalent residues, with main exceptions residing at the EF and GH loops at the entrance to the cavity, and also at the C terminus at the top of the molecule (Fig. 3D). Per a 4 superimposed poorly with Bos d 5, with a r.m.s. deviation of 3.0 Å for Cα atoms of 118 structurally equivalent residues and with main discrepancies at the N and C termini as well as the AB and EF loops surrounding the entrance of the cavity (Fig. 3E). Overall, both Bla g 4 and Per a 4 are structurally more similar to nonallergenic than allergenic lipocalins. Moreover, due to its much longer C-terminal α-helix, Bla g 4 aligned less well with other lipocalins than Per a 4. The Per a 4 Dimer—Both Bla g 4 and Per a 4 were crystallized with 2 molecules in the asymmetric unit. However, only Per a 4 was found to exist as a dimer in solution. When expressed using Origami cells, gel filtration studies have showed that Per a 4 eluted as a dimer, whereas Bla g 4 eluted as a monomeric protein. Formation of the disulfide bonds in Per a 4 may be essential for its dimer formation as both Bla g 4 and Per a 4 eluted as a monomeric protein when expressed in BL21(DE3) cells (Fig. 4C). The two monomers of Per a 4 are packed side by side with each other leaving the entrance to the ligand binding cavity open and pointing into opposite directions. The 2 α-helices are on opposite sides of the dimer running in an anti-parallel fashion (Fig. 4, A and B). Residues from the loops (AB and GH) and the C terminus at the top of one monomer are in close contact with residues from the loops (BC and DE) and the N terminus at the bottom of another monomer (Fig. 4, A and B). There is an extensive network of hydrogen bonds in the dimeric interface. A total of 12 hydrogen bonds (7 backbone to side chain; 1 backbone to backbone and 4 side chain to side chain) are observed in the dimeric interface. There is no significant hydrophobic interaction involved in the dimeric interface, a case that is very different for other lipocalins. For instance, Equ c 1 has an extended hydrophobic patch at the center of the dimeric interface (10Lascombe M.-B. Grégoire C. Poncet P. Tavares G.A. Rosinski-Chupin I. Rabillon J. Goubran-Botros H. Mazié J.-C. David B. Alzari P.M. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 21572-21577Google Scholar). The dimeric interface of Per a 4 buried an area of 858 Å2, which is ∼10% of the total solvent accessible surface. Presence of a tight dimeric interface suggests that this is a physiologically relevant Per a 4 dimer. The Putative Ligand Binding Sites of Bla g 4 and Per a 4—Lipocalins carry out their function by binding small hydrophobic ligands such as pheromones, steroids, and retinoids (31Pomés A. Wünschmann S. Hindley J. Vailes L.D. Chapman M.D. Protein Pept. Lett... 2007; 14: 960-969Google Scholar). Many lipocalins have been suggested to be involved in regulation of cell homeostasis (32Flower D.R. FEBS Lett... 1994; 354: 7-11Google Scholar). Recent studies have found that the lipocalin Bla g 4 is expressed only in the adult male reproductive system of cockroach, specifically in the utricles and the conglobate gland, and is transferred to the female within the spermatophore during copulation (33Fan Y. Gore J.C. Redding K.O. Vailes L.D. Chapman M.D. Schal C. Insect Mol. Biol... 2005; 14: 45-53Google Scholar). Topical application of juvenile hormone III (10-eposy-methylfarnesoate, JH III) (Fig. 5A) stimulated Bla g 4 production by both the conglobate gland and utricles (33Fan Y. Gore J.C. Redding K.O. Vailes L.D. Chapman M.D. Schal C. Insect Mol. Biol... 2005; 14: 45-53Google Scholar). We have performed titration of JH III into NMR samples of Bla g 4 and Per a 4 and found significant perturbation of chemical shifts in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra (supplemental Fig. S1), indicating the interaction of JH III with both Bla g 4 and Per a 4. During crystallization of Per a 4, polyethylene glycol (PEG) from the buffer co-crystallized with Per a 4 in a conformation almost perpendicular to the axis of the β-barrel and with one end of the molecule curved upward toward the entrance of the β-barrel (Fig. 5B). We have thus docked JH III on Bla g 4 and Per a 4 using Autodock 4.0 with rigid protein side chains (19Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem... 1998; 19: 1639-1662Google Scholar) to determine whether JHIII will adopt a conformation similar to that of PEG. Docking of JH III on Bla g 4 showed that JH III molecule lies almost perpendicular to the axis of the β-barrel and located closely to the entrance of the β-barrel (Fig. 5C). The docked li"

Based on data implicating IRS-2 but not IRS-1 in breast cancer invasion, survival, and metastasis, we assessed the contribution of IRS-1 and IRS-2 to aerobic glycolysis, which is known to impact tumor growth and progression. For this purpose, we used tumor cell lines derived from transgenic mice that express the polyoma virus middle T antigen (PyV-MT) in the mammary gland and that are wild-type (WT) or null for either Irs-1 (Irs-1–/–) or Irs-2 (Irs-2–/–). Aerobic glycolysis, as assessed by the rate of lactic acid production and glucose consumption, was diminished significantly in Irs-2–/– cells when compared with WT and Irs-1–/– cells. Expression of exogenous Irs-2 in Irs-2–/– cells restored the rate of glycolysis to that observed in WT cells. The transcription factor FoxO1 does not appear to be involved in Irs-2-mediated glycolysis. However, Irs-2 does regulate the surface expression of glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) as assessed by flow cytometry using a Glut1-specific ligand. Suppression of Glut1 expression inhibits Irs-2-dependent invasion, which links glycolysis to mammary tumor progression. Irs-2 was shown to be important for mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) activation, and Irs-2-dependent regulation of Glut1 surface expression is rapamycin-sensitive. Collectively, our data indicate that Irs-2, but not Irs-1, promotes invasion by sustaining the aerobic glycolysis of mouse mammary tumor cells and that it does so by regulating the mTor-dependent surface expression of Glut1. The insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins are cytoplasmic adaptor molecules that function as signaling intermediates downstream of activated cell surface receptors. Based on data implicating IRS-2 but not IRS-1 in breast cancer invasion, survival, and metastasis, we assessed the contribution of IRS-1 and IRS-2 to aerobic glycolysis, which is known to impact tumor growth and progression. For this purpose, we used tumor cell lines derived from transgenic mice that express the polyoma virus middle T antigen (PyV-MT) in the mammary gland and that are wild-type (WT) or null for either Irs-1 (Irs-1–/–) or Irs-2 (Irs-2–/–). Aerobic glycolysis, as assessed by the rate of lactic acid production and glucose consumption, was diminished significantly in Irs-2–/– cells when compared with WT and Irs-1–/– cells. Expression of exogenous Irs-2 in Irs-2–/– cells restored the rate of glycolysis to that observed in WT cells. The transcription factor FoxO1 does not appear to be involved in Irs-2-mediated glycolysis. However, Irs-2 does regulate the surface expression of glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) as assessed by flow cytometry using a Glut1-specific ligand. Suppression of Glut1 expression inhibits Irs-2-dependent invasion, which links glycolysis to mammary tumor progression. Irs-2 was shown to be important for mammalian target of rapamycin (mTor) activation, and Irs-2-dependent regulation of Glut1 surface expression is rapamycin-sensitive. Collectively, our data indicate that Irs-2, but not Irs-1, promotes invasion by sustaining the aerobic glycolysis of mouse mammary tumor cells and that it does so by regulating the mTor-dependent surface expression of Glut1. Glucose metabolism in cancer cells differs significantly from that of normal cells as observed initially by Warburg in the 1920s (1Warburg O. Science.. 1956; 123: 309-314Google Scholar). Specifically, cancer cells depend more on glycolysis than oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP, even in high oxygen tensions. Subsequent studies have affirmed the importance of aerobic glycolysis in tumor progression and have shown that it provides tumor cells with a selective advantage in their ability to progress toward invasive and metastatic disease (2Gatenby R.A. Gillies R.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer.. 2004; 4: 891-899Google Scholar, 3DeBerardinis R.J. Lum J.J. Hatzivassiliou G. Thompson C.B. Cell Metab.. 2008; 7: 11-20Google Scholar, 4Kroemer G. Pouyssegur J. Cancer Cell.. 2008; 13: 472-482Google Scholar). Significantly, the “Warburg effect” has become a powerful and standard imaging technique for detecting tumors and their metastases by positron emission tomography using [18F]deoxyglucose (5Gambhir S.S. Nat. Rev. Cancer.. 2002; 2: 683-693Google Scholar). Aerobic glycolysis is also an ideal target for therapeutic intervention because apoptosis results if this process is perturbed (2Gatenby R.A. Gillies R.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer.. 2004; 4: 891-899Google Scholar, 6Garber K. Science.. 2006; 312: 1158-1159Google Scholar). To exploit aerobic glycolysis for the clinical management of cancer, however, much more needs to be learned about how this form of metabolism is induced and sustained in tumors. Our interest is in understanding how aerobic glycolysis is regulated in breast cancer. The insulin receptor substrate (IRS) 3The abbreviations used are: IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PyV-MT, polyoma virus middle T antigen; WT, wild type; mTor, mammalian target of rapamycin; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor-1; Glut1, glucose transporter 1; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. proteins are cytoplasmic adaptor molecules that function as signaling intermediates downstream of activated cell surface receptors (7White M.F. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol.. 2006; 84: 725-737Google Scholar). The role of the IRS-2 family member is of particular significance in breast cancer. IRS-2 is predominantly expressed in estrogen receptor-negative breast carcinoma cell lines, which are invasive and metastatic (8Jackson J.G. Zhang X. Yoneda T. Yee D. Oncogene.. 2001; 20: 7318-7325Google Scholar). Moreover, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) promotes cell motility and invasion and metastasis in human breast carcinoma cell lines that signal preferentially through IRS-2 (8Jackson J.G. Zhang X. Yoneda T. Yee D. Oncogene.. 2001; 20: 7318-7325Google Scholar, 9Dunn S.E. Ehrlich M. Sharp N.J. Reiss K. Solomon G. Hawkins R. Baserga R. Barrett J.C.

In contrast, signaling through IRS-1 promotes breast carcinoma cell proliferation (13Byron S.A. Horwitz K.B. Richer J.K. Lange C.A. Zhang X. Yee D. Br. J. Cancer.. 2006; 95: 1220-1228Google Scholar). Our own studies using a transgenic mouse model of breast cancer have revealed a striking role for Irs-2 in promoting tumor survival and metastasis that cannot be compensated for by Irs-1 (14Nagle J.A. Ma Z. Byrne M.A. White M.F. Shaw L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2004; 24: 9726-9735Google Scholar). Given that both IRS-2 signaling and aerobic glycolysis enhance the invasive and metastatic behavior of breast carcinomas, we sought to establish a role for IRS-2 in regulating this essential process in breast cancer. We report here that Irs-2 but not Irs-1 promotes invasion by sustaining aerobic glycolysis in mouse mammary tumor cells and that it does so by regulating the mTor-dependent surface expression of glucose transporter 1 (Glut1). Cell Lines, Antibodies, and Reagents—Mammary tumor cell lines were isolated from PyV-MT-derived wild-type (WT), Irs-1–/–, and Irs-2–/– tumors as described previously (14Nagle J.A. Ma Z. Byrne M.A. White M.F. Shaw L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2004; 24: 9726-9735Google Scholar). Cell lines were maintained in low glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). The murine Irs-2 construct (pCMVHis-Irs-2) was provided by Morris White (Children's Hospital, Boston, MA). Cells were transfected using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations and then selected for stable expression of the constructs with histidinol (Sigma). LY294002 was obtained from Cell Signaling, Inc. (Beverly, MA), and rapamycin was obtained from Sigma. The following antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting: IRS-1 (Bethyl Laboratories); IRS-2 (immunoblot, Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences, Inc., Darmstadt, Germany; immunoprecipitation, Bethyl Laboratories); phosphotyrosine (PY99; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); FoxO1 (CeMines); Glut1 (AbCam); and actin and tubulin (Sigma). All other antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling, Inc. Glucose Uptake and Lactic Acid Production Assays—Mammary tumor cells were grown to near confluence in 24-well plates, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated for 6–24 h with either fresh serum-containing medium or DMEM containing 0.1% heat-inactivated BSA (DMEM/BSA) in the presence or absence of IGF-1 (50 ng/ml) and inhibitors. Glucose and lactic acid were subsequently assayed in the conditioned medium using a glucose assay kit (Sigma) and lactic acid assay kit (Trinity Biotech). The amount of cellular protein per well was quantified by the Bradford assay, and the metabolism of glucose and lactic acid was expressed as a rate measurement (mm/mg of total protein/h). Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were deprived of serum overnight in DMEM/BSA and then stimulated with IGF-1 (100 ng/ml) for the time periods indicated in Fig. 5. Cells were solubilized at 4 °C for 10 min in a 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors (Complete mini tab; Roche Applied Science). Nuclei were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. Aliquots of cell extracts containing equivalent amounts of protein were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with antibodies and protein-A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) with constant agitation. Frozen tumors were homogenized at 4 °C in T-PER tissue protein extraction reagent (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.), containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors (Complete mini; Roche Applied Science). Immune complexes, as well as aliquots of cell and tumor extracts containing equivalent amounts of total protein, were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Membranes were blocked for an hour using a 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, and 5% (w/v) Carnation dry milk. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the same buffer containing primary antibodies. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) after a 1-h incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. For phospho-immunoblots, the blocking buffer for the primary antibodies contained 5% (w/v) BSA. FoxO1 Experiments—Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared using the NE-PER extraction kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To suppress FoxO1 expression, cells were infected with a pLKO lentivirus containing either a FoxO1-specific or a GFP-specific shRNA (Open Biosystems), and stable subclones were selected with puromycin. Glut1 Surface Expression—Mammary tumor cells were grown overnight, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated for 24 h with fresh DMEM/BSA in the presence or absence of IGF-1 (50 ng/ml) and inhibitors. Cells were trypsinized, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 0.01% sodium azide (PBA), and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in PBA in the presence or absence of EGFP-Glut1 ligand (1:10 dilution; AbCys (15Manel N. Kim F.J. Kinet S. Taylor N. Sitbon M. Battini J.L. Cell.. 2003; 115: 449-459Google Scholar, 16Kim F.J. Manel N. Garrido E.N. Valle C. Sitbon M. Battini J.L. Retrovirology.. 2004; 1: 41Google Scholar)). Cells were washed once in PBA and analyzed by flow cytometry. Invasion Assay—To suppress Glut1 expression, cells were infected with pLKO lentiviruses containing either Glut1-specific or GFP-specific shRNA (Open Biosystems). Infected cells were incubated for 48 h, and then Matrigel invasion assays were performed as described previously using 6.5-mm Transwell chambers (8-μm pore size) (17Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell.. 1997; 91: 949-960Google Scholar). After 5 h, the cells that had invaded to the lower surface of the filters were fixed in methanol for 10 min. The fixed membranes were mounted on glass slides using Vectashield mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Invasion was quantified by counting the number of stained nuclei in five independent fields in each Transwell. Statistics—All statistical analyses were performed using a two-tailed Student's t test for unpaired data. A p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Corresponding significance levels are indicated in the figure legends. Irs-2 Is Required for the Aerobic Glycolysis of Metastatic Mammary Carcinoma Cells in Vitro—To assess the importance of Irs-1 and Irs-2 in mammary carcinoma aerobic glycolysis, we examined the rate of lactic acid production and glucose consumption in tumor cell lines established from WT, Irs-1–/–, and Irs-2–/– PyV-MT-derived mammary tumors (Fig. 1A). Generation of these cell lines has been reported previously, and Irs-2–/– cells have been shown to be poorly invasive and more apoptotic in response to growth factor deprivation than their WT or Irs-1–/– counterparts (14Nagle J.A. Ma Z. Byrne M.A. White M.F. Shaw L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2004; 24: 9726-9735Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, mammary tumor cells lacking Irs-2 had a dramatically reduced (∼80%) basal rate of lactic acid production when compared with WT cells. The effect of Irs-2 on aerobic glycolysis was also assessed by measuring the rate of glucose consumption. A 50–70% decrease in glucose consumption was observed in Irs-2–/– cells when compared with WT cells (Fig. 1C). Importantly, glucose uptake and lactic acid production were not diminished in Irs-1–/– cell lines that express only Irs-2 (Fig. 1, B and C). To assess the contribution of Irs-2 to glycolysis directly, WT and Irs-2–/– cells were stimulated with IGF-1, which signals through the Irs proteins (7White M.F. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol.. 2006; 84: 725-737Google Scholar). WT cells responded to IGF-1 with an ∼2-fold increase in lactic acid production. In contrast, no IGF-1-dependent increase in lactic acid production was observed in cells lacking Irs-2 expression (Fig. 1D). We next confirmed the specificity of Irs-2 in regulating aerobic glycolysis in mammary carcinoma cells. Irs-2 expression was restored in Irs-2–/– cells following stable transfection with pCMVHis-Irs-2. The level of Irs-2 protein expression in stable transfectants was found to be similar to Irs-2 protein levels in WT cells, as determined by immunoblotting (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, restoration of Irs-2 in Irs-2–/– cells increased their rate of lactic acid production by 3.5-fold when compared with vector control cells. The rate of lactic acid production in the Irs-2-rescued cells was ∼75% of WT cells. We also observed a corresponding and significant increase (∼50%) in glucose consumption when Irs-2 expression was restored in Irs-2–/– cells (Fig. 2C). We conclude from these data that Irs-2 expression in mouse mammary tumor cells is required to sustain aerobic glycolysis. Irs-2 Promotes Glycolysis by Stimulating Glut1 Surface Expression—We next explored the molecular mechanism through which Irs-2 regulates aerobic glycolysis. The Akt-FoxO1 pathway has been linked specifically to IRS-2 signaling (18Guo S. Dunn S.L. White M.F. Mol. Endocrinol.. 2006; 20: 3389-3399Google Scholar). It is known that the intracellular distribution of the transcription factor FoxO1 is primarily determined by its phosphorylation status (19Biggs III, W.H. Meisenhelder J. Hunter T. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1999; 96: 7421-7426Google Scholar). Specifically, Akt initially phosphorylates FoxO1 on Ser256, causing its exclusion from the nucleus and subsequent retention in the cytoplasm. Conversely, a decrease in the phosphorylation of FoxO1 allows FoxO1 to remain in the nucleus, where it represses transcription of FoxO1 target genes. FoxO1 signaling has been linked to the repression of glycolysis and stimulation of gluconeogenesis (20Zhang W. Patil S. Chauhan B. Guo S. Powell D.R. Le J. Klotsas A. Matika R. Xiao X. Franks R. Heidenreich K.A. Sajan M.P. Farese R.V. Stolz D.B. Tso P. Koo S.H. Montminy M. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem.. 2006; 281: 10105-10117Google Scholar, 21Buteau J. Shlien A. Foisy S. Accili D. J. Biol. Chem.. 2007; 282: 287-293Google Scholar). On the basis of these reports and our previous demonstration that Irs-2 preferentially activates Akt signaling in tumors (22Ma Z. Gibson S.L. Byrne M.A. Zhang J. White M.F. Shaw L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2006; 26: 9338-9351Google Scholar), we initially postulated that Irs-2 stimulates aerobic glycolysis in mouse mammary tumor cells by signaling through Akt-FoxO1. In Irs-2–/– cells, FoxO1 was hypophosphorylated at Ser256 and localized at higher levels in the nucleus when compared with both WT cells and Irs-2-restored Irs-2–/– cells (Fig. 3, A and B). Importantly, however, suppression of FoxO1 expression by shRNA targeting did not rescue glycolysis in the Irs-2–/– cells (Fig. 3, C and D). These observations discount a major role for FoxO1 in mediating Irs-2-regulated aerobic glycolysis. Another hypothesis to account for our data is that Irs-2 regulates glucose transporter expression to enhance glucose uptake, a rate-limiting step in the glycolysis pathway. Glut1, in particular, plays an important role in tumor glycolysis (2Gatenby R.A. Gillies R.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer.. 2004; 4: 891-899Google Scholar) and appears to be the predominant glucose transporter in breast cancer (23Kang S.S. Chun Y.K. Hur M.H. Lee H.K. Kim Y.J. Hong S.R. Lee J.H. Lee S.G. Park Y.K. Jpn. J. Cancer Res.. 2002; 93: 1123-1128Google Scholar, 24Moadel R.M. Weldon R.H. Katz E.B. Lu P. Mani J. Stahl M. Blaufox M.D. Pestell R.G. Charron M.J. Dadachova E. Cancer Res.. 2005; 65: 698-702Google Scholar), and its expression has been shown to correlate with tumor aggressiveness and reduced survival time in women with breast cancer (23Kang S.S. Chun Y.K. Hur M.H. Lee H.K. Kim Y.J. Hong S.R. Lee J.H. Lee S.G. Park Y.K. Jpn. J. Cancer Res.. 2002; 93: 1123-1128Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, total expression of Glut1 is similar in WT, Irs-1–/–, and Irs-2–/– cells, indicating that Irs-2 does not regulate Glut1 expression. Next, we assessed the surface expression of Glut1 by flow cytometry using a GFP-tagged human T cell leukemia virus peptide (EGFP-Glut1) that specifically recognizes extracellular Glut1 (15Manel N. Kim F.J. Kinet S. Taylor N. Sitbon M. Battini J.L. Cell.. 2003; 115: 449-459Google Scholar, 16Kim F.J. Manel N. Garrido E.N. Valle C. Sitbon M. Battini J.L. Retrovirology.. 2004; 1: 41Google Scholar). EGFP-Glut1 binding was decreased significantly in Irs-2–/– cells when compared with WT or Irs-1–/– cells, indicating that Irs-2 regulates Glut1 surface expression (Fig. 4B). Moreover, expression of Irs-2 in the null cells restored EGFP-Glut1 binding without affecting total Glut1 protein expression (Fig. 4, C and D). Glut1-dependent Glycolysis Contributes to Mammary Tumor Cell Invasion—To investigate the functional link between our observation that Irs-2 regulates aerobic glycolysis and the preferential ability of Irs-2 to promote breast carcinoma cell invasion and metastasis, Glut1 expression was suppressed in Irs-1–/– mammary tumor cells, which express only Irs-2, by shRNA targeting. Suppression of Glut1 expression in these cells by ∼80% resulted in a significant decrease in both glucose uptake (data not shown) and mammary tumor cell invasion (Fig. 4, E and F). Irs-2 Regulates Glut 1 Surface Expression through a PI3K/mTor-dependent Pathway—The Irs proteins function by organizing signaling complexes at activated surface receptors to initiate downstream signaling cascades (7White M.F. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol.. 2006; 84: 725-737Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism by which Irs-2 selectively regulates Glut1 surface expression, we evaluated the activation of signaling pathways downstream of this adaptor protein. WT cells, which express both Irs-1 and Irs-2, and Irs-1–/– cells, which express only Irs-2, were stimulated with IGF-1 to activate Irs-dependent signaling pathways. As shown in Fig. 5A, IGF-1 treatment of WT cells resulted in a modest increase in mTor activation and subsequent activation of its downstream effector S6-kinase. In contrast, stimulation of Irs-1–/– cells resulted in a marked increase in activation of the mTor pathway downstream of Irs-2. The basal level of mTor activation was also higher in the Irs-1–/– cells, which supports the enhanced Irs-2-dependent glycolysis observed in the absence of IGF-1 stimulation (Fig. 1). These findings agree with our previous observation that activation of the PI3K/mTor pathway is enhanced in Irs-1–/– tumors (22Ma Z. Gibson S.L. Byrne M.A. Zhang J. White M.F. Shaw L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2006; 26: 9338-9351Google Scholar). To examine further whether Irs-2 is required for mTor signaling, we assessed the status of this pathway in Irs-2–/– tumors that express only Irs-1. When compared with WT tumors, activation of the mTor effectors S6-kinase and 4EBP1 was significantly lower in tumors that lack Irs-2 expression, indicating that Irs-1 cannot compensate for the activation of this pathway in vivo (Fig. 5B). To assess the involvement of mTor signaling in the Irs-2-mediated enhancement of glycolysis, Irs-1–/– cells were stimulated with IGF-1 in the presence of inhibitors of this signaling pathway. IGF-1 stimulation increased Glut1 surface expression, and this increase was prevented when PI3K and mTor signaling was inhibited using LY29004 and rapamycin, respectively (Fig. 5C). IGF-1 also stimulated a corresponding increase in glucose uptake in the Irs-1–/– cells, which was also prevented by inhibition of PI3K/mTor signaling (Fig. 5D). Given that the total levels of Glut1 expression were not affected significantly by IGF-1 stimulation or inhibition of mTor signaling (Fig. 5C, lower panels), our data indicate that Irs-2 regulates the surface expression of Glut1 in an mTor-dependent manner to enhance tumor glycolysis. This study establishes an important link among insulin receptor substrate signaling, aerobic glycolysis, and the aggressive behavior of mammary carcinoma cells. Specifically, we demonstrate that aerobic glycolysis in mammary carcinoma cells is dependent on Irs-2 but not on Irs-1 and that Irs-2 functions to maintain the surface expression of Glut1 by an mTor-dependent mechanism. Irs-2-dependent regulation of glycolysis is linked to the ability of this adaptor protein to promote mammary tumor cell invasion. Collectively, our data provide a mechanism to substantiate the finding derived from transgenic mouse models that Irs-2 has a causal role in breast cancer progression (14Nagle J.A. Ma Z. Byrne M.A. White M.F. Shaw L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2004; 24: 9726-9735Google Scholar, 22Ma Z. Gibson S.L. Byrne M.A. Zhang J. White M.F. Shaw L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2006; 26: 9338-9351Google Scholar), and they support the hypothesis that the ability of tumor cells to sustain aerobic glycolysis is an essential component of the metastatic odyssey (2Gatenby R.A. Gillies R.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer.. 2004; 4: 891-899Google Scholar). The ability of IRS-2 to sustain aerobic glycolysis provides a mechanistic basis for the necessity of this signaling adaptor in breast cancer progression. As mentioned, this study was predicated on the previous finding that mammary tumors deficient in Irs-2 are significantly more apoptotic, less invasive, and unable to metastasize when compared with either wild-type tumors or tumors deficient in Irs-1 (14Nagle J.A. Ma Z. Byrne M.A. White M.F. Shaw L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2004; 24: 9726-9735Google Scholar). As discussed comprehensively in a recent review (4Kroemer G. Pouyssegur J. Cancer Cell.. 2008; 13: 472-482Google Scholar), there are several reasons why the ability to sustain aerobic glycolysis is advantageous for tumors including the ability to sustain fluctuations in oxygen tension that would be toxic to cells that depend on oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, IRS-2 could provide a degree of autonomy that enables cells to survive within a hypoxic tumor microenvironment. In this direction, an important consideration from our data is that mammary carcinoma cells are able to sustain aerobic glycolysis in the absence of exogenous growth factor stimulation (i.e. serum-deprived conditions) and that this glycolysis is dependent on Irs-2. Although we observed that growth factor (IGF-1) stimulation can enhance Irs-2-mediated glycolysis, our findings imply that these cells possess intrinsic mechanisms such as autocrine growth factor stimulation that maintain Irs-2-mediated signaling and glycolysis. The acids (lactic and bicarbonic) that are generated by aerobic glycolysis can facilitate tumor invasion by degrading extracellular matrix (4Kroemer G. Pouyssegur J. Cancer Cell.. 2008; 13: 472-482Google Scholar, 25Gatenby R.A. Gawlinski E.T. Gmitro A.F. Kaylor B. Gillies R.J. Cancer Res.. 2006; 66: 5216-5223Google Scholar). This function is consistent with our previous finding that Irs-2–/– cells are significantly less invasive than wild-type or Irs-1–/– cells (14Nagle J.A. Ma Z. Byrne M.A. White M.F. Shaw L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2004; 24: 9726-9735Google Scholar) and our current results demonstrating that suppression of glycolysis inhibits Irs-2-dependent mammary tumor cell invasion. It is worth noting in this context that the rate of aerobic glycolysis correlates with the aggressiveness of human breast carcinoma cell lines (2Gatenby R.A. Gillies R.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer.. 2004; 4: 891-899Google Scholar) and that IRS-2 expression correlates with their rate of glycolysis (data not shown). These observations support that the ability of Irs-2 to regulate aerobic glycolysis contributes to tumor progression. Although aerobic glycolysis appears to be essential for tumor progression, data that elucidate the mechanisms that promote glycolysis in tumor cells are only beginning to emerge, especially for solid tumors (4Kroemer G. Pouyssegur J. Cancer Cell.. 2008; 13: 472-482Google Scholar). In principle, aerobic glycolysis in tumors can be regulated at the level of glycolytic enzymes or glucose transporters. The recent, seminal finding that tumor cells express an embryonic M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase and that this isoform, but not the M1 isoform expressed in normal adult cells, promotes aerobic glycolysis (26Christofk H.R. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Ramanathan A. Gerszten R.E. Wei R. Fleming M.D. Schreiber S.L. Cantley L.C. Nature.. 2008; 452: 230-233Google Scholar) substantiates the hypothesis that glycolysis can be regulated at the level of glycolytic enzymes in tumor cells. In this direction, it will be interesting to assess the impact of IRS-2 expression on M2 isoform-mediated glycolysis in mammary tumor cells, especially because such cells were shown to express the M2 isoform (26Christofk H.R. Vander Heiden M.G. Harris M.H. Ramanathan A. Gerszten R.E. Wei R. Fleming M.D. Schreiber S.L. Cantley L.C. Nature.. 2008; 452: 230-233Google Scholar). The data we present here, however, center on the surface expression of glucose transporters as a mechanism to regulate glycolysis. We conclude from our data that Irs-2 regulates the surface expression of Glut1 in an mTor-dependent manner. Multiple mechanisms have been proposed for the regulation of Glut1 by mTor signaling, including at the level of protein expression, transporter activation, and trafficking (27Taha C. Liu Z. Jin J. Al-Hasani H. Sonenberg N. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem.. 1999; 274: 33085-33091Google Scholar, 28Zhou Q.L. Jiang Z.Y. Holik J. Chawla A. Hagan G.N. Leszyk J. Czech M.P. Biochem.

Bissler J. Yeung R.S. Am. J. Pathol.. 2008; 172: 1748-1756Google Scholar). In one study that examined interleukin-3-dependent regulation of glycolysis using a hematopoietic/lymphoid cell line, Glut1 surface expression was not affected by rapamycin treatment (30Wieman H.L. Wofford J.A. Rathmell J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2007; 18: 1437-1446Google Scholar). Rapamycin did, however, inhibit glucose uptake, suggesting that mTor signaling may regulate Glut1 transporter activity (30Wieman H.L. Wofford J.A. Rathmell J.C. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2007; 18: 1437-1446Google Scholar). In contrast, a recent study using Tsc2–/– fibroblasts reported that mTor signaling regulates the surface localization of several glucose transporters, including Glut1, through phosphorylation of the microtubule linker protein CLIP170 (31Jiang X. Kenerson H. Aicher L. Miyaoka R. Eary J. Bissler J. Yeung R.S. Am. J. Pathol.. 2008; 172: 1748-1756Google Scholar). In this study, constitutive mTor signaling inhibited Glut1 expression on the cell surface. We observed a negative effect of rapamycin on Glut1 surface expression in our studies, which supports a positive role for mTor signaling in Glut1 trafficking and suggests that dynamic regulation of this pathway may be necessary for normal trafficking. However, the possibility that rapamycin also affects Glut1 activity in our model system cannot be excluded. Ours is the first study to implicate the Irs proteins in regulating glucose uptake in tumor cells, and our data reveal a novel mechanism for regulating tumor cell glycolysis. The involvement of the Irs proteins in regulating glucose transport in insulin-responsive tissues has been investigated previously, and most of these studies have focused on their involvement in regulating Glut4, the major insulin-stimulated glucose transporter. These studies have revealed that the contribution of Irs-1 and Irs-2 to glucose transporter regulation is cell type-dependent. In brown adipocytes, Irs-2 regulates the insulin-dependent translocation of Glut4 to the plasma membrane (32Fasshauer M. Klein J. Ueki K. Kriauciunas K.M. Benito M. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem.. 2000; 275: 25494-25501Google Scholar), whereas Irs-1 appears to play the primary role in regulating Glut4 trafficking in other adipocyte model systems and in myotubes (33Kaburagi Y. Satoh S.

Huang X. Klip A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2005; 280: 19426-19435Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the regulation of glucose transporter trafficking is distinct in breast cancer cells from these previously published studies because GLUT1 appears to be the major glucose transporter that is expressed in breast cancer (23Kang S.S. Chun Y.K. Hur M.H. Lee H.K. Kim Y.J. Hong S.R. Lee J.H. Lee S.G. Park Y.K. Jpn. J. Cancer Res.. 2002; 93: 1123-1128Google Scholar, 24Moadel R.M. Weldon R.H. Katz E.B. Lu P. Mani J. Stahl M. Blaufox M.D. Pestell R.G. Charron M.J. Dadachova E. Cancer Res.. 2005; 65: 698-702Google Scholar) and its surface expression is dependent on IRS-2. A novel conclusion from our data is that increased expression of GLUT1 alone may not be sufficient to confer enhanced glycolysis in human tumors because factors such as IRS-2 may be required for GLUT1 to localize to the cell surface where it can facilitate glucose uptake. A major finding in this study is that Irs-1 and Irs-2 differ markedly in their ability to activate mTor and sustain aerobic glycolysis in mammary carcinoma cells. These data are consistent with our previous finding that mammary tumor progression is significantly diminished in the absence of Irs-2 and that Irs-1 cannot compensate for loss of Irs-2 (14Nagle J.A. Ma Z. Byrne M.A. White M.F. Shaw L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2004; 24: 9726-9735Google Scholar). Although both Irs-1 and Irs-2 can activate PI3K, which is an upstream regulator of mTor, Irs-2 activates mTor preferentially in mammary tumor cells, suggesting that there are mechanisms that control the signaling outcomes of these adaptor proteins. One potential mechanism that could selectively restrict downstream signaling from Irs-1 or Irs-2 is a differential sensitivity to negative feedback regulation. Many of the kinases that are activated downstream of the IRS proteins including Akt, S6-kinase, mTor, and MAPKs can phosphorylate the IRS proteins on serine/threonine residues to disrupt signaling either through inactivation or through degradation (reviewed in Ref. 36Gual P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Tanti J.F. Biochimie (Paris).. 2005; 87: 99-109Google Scholar). Differences in the subcellular localization of IRS-1 and IRS-2 could also impact their downstream signaling pathways and consequent ability to regulate aerobic glycolysis. In breast carcinomas, IRS-1, but not IRS-2, is expressed in the nucleus, where it has been reported to contribute to both gene regulation and DNA repair (37Trojanek J. Ho T. Del Valle L. Nowicki M. Wang J.Y. Lassak A. Peruzzi F. Khalili K. Skorski T. Reiss K. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2003; 23: 7510-7524Google Scholar, 38Morelli C. Garofalo C. Sisci D. del Rincon S. Cascio S. Tu X. Vecchione A.

Surmacz E. J. Clin. Pathol. (Lond.).. 2006; 60: 633-641Google Scholar). In adipocytes, IRS-1 is found predominantly in an intracellular membrane compartment, whereas IRS-2 is more concentrated in the cytosol (40Inoue G. Cheatham B. Emkey R. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem.. 1998; 273: 11548-11555Google Scholar). Differential compartmentalization of IRS-1 and IRS-2 would influence access to distinct substrates and regulatory proteins. These potential mechanisms need to be evaluated with respect to IRS-2-specific regulation of mTOR and aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer cells. In summary, the data reported here implicate Irs-2 but not Irs-1 in the regulation of aerobic glycolysis in mammary tumor cells by a mechanism that involves mTor-dependent regulation of Glut1 surface expression. Our data link the regulation of aerobic glycolysis in breast cancer to tumor cell invasion and reveal a novel mechanism by which IRS-2 promotes breast cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2093756720,"Background Aspergillus nidulans is an important model organism for studies on fundamental eukaryotic cell biology and on industrial processes due to its close relation to A. niger and A. oryzae. Here we identified the gene coding for a novel metabolic pathway in A. nidulans, namely the phosphoketolase pathway, and investigated the role of an increased phosphoketolase activity. Methodology/Principal Findings Over-expression of the phosphoketolase gene (phk) improved the specific growth rate on xylose, glycerol and ethanol. Transcriptome analysis showed that a total of 1,222 genes were significantly affected by over-expression of the phk, while more than half of the affected genes were carbon source specific. During growth on glucose medium, the transcriptome analysis showed that the response to phk over-expression is targeted to neutralize the effect of the over-expression by regulating the acetate metabolism and initiate a growth dampening response. Conclusions/Significance Metabolic flux analysis using 13C-labelled glucose, showed that over-expression of phosphoketolase added flexibility to the central metabolism. Our findings further suggests that A. nidulans is not optimized for growth on xylose, glycerol or ethanol as the sole carbon sources."
https://openalex.org/W2056009047,"Type I Hsp40s are molecular chaperones that protect neurons from degeneration by modulating the aggregation state of amyloid-forming proteins. How Type I Hsp40s recognize beta-rich, amyloid-like substrates is currently unknown. Thus, we examined the mechanism for binding between the Type I Hsp40 Ydj1 and the yeast prion [RNQ+]. Ydj1 recognized the Gln/Asn-rich prion domain from Rnq1 specifically when it assembled into the amyloid-like [RNQ+] prion state. Upon deletion of YDJ1, overexpression of the Rnq1 prion domain killed yeast. Surprisingly, binding and suppression of prion domain toxicity by Ydj1 was dependent upon farnesylation of its C-terminal CAAX box and action of a zinc finger-like region. In contrast, folding of luciferase was independent of farnesylation, yet required the zinc finger-like region of Ydj1 and a conserved hydrophobic peptide-binding pocket. Type I Hsp40s contain at least three different domains that work in concert to bind different protein conformers. The combined action of a farnesyl moiety and zinc finger-like region enable Type I Hsp40s to recognize amyloid-like substrates and prevent formation of cytotoxic protein species."
https://openalex.org/W1970566822,"Dietary supplementation with resveratrol may produce calorie restriction-like effects on metabolic and longevity endpoints in mice. In this study, we sought to determine whether resveratrol treatment elicited other hallmark changes associated with calorie restriction, namely bradycardia and decreased body temperature. We found that during short-term treatment, wild-type mice on a calorie-restricted diet experienced significant decreases in both heart rate and body temperature after only 1 day whereas those receiving resveratrol exhibited no such change after 1 wk. We also used ob/ob mice to study the effects of long-term treatment because previous studies had indicated the therapeutic value of resveratrol against the linked morbidities of obesity and diabetes. After 12 wk, resveratrol treatment had produced no changes in either heart rate or body temperature. Strikingly, and in contrast to previous findings, we found that resveratrol-treated mice had significantly reduced endurance in a treadmill test. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction suggested that a proposed target of resveratrol, Sirt1, was activated in resveratrol-treated ob/ob mice. Thus, we conclude that the bradycardia and hypothermia associated with calorie restriction occur through mechanisms unaffected by the actions of resveratrol and that further studies are needed to examine the differential effects of resveratrol in a leptin-deficient background."

Colicins intrude into the host cell by exploiting existing transport, diffusion, or efflux systems. We have traced the way colicin S4 takes to execute its function and show that it interacts specifically with OmpW, OmpF, and the Tol system before it inserts its pore-forming domain into the cytoplasmic membrane. The common structural architecture of colicins comprises a translocation, a receptor-binding, and an activity domain. We have solved the crystal structure of colicin S4 to a resolution of 2.5 A, which shows a remarkably compact domain arrangement of four independent domains, including a unique domain duplication of the receptor-binding domain. Finally, we have determined the residues responsible for binding to the receptor OmpW by mutating exposed charged residues in one or both receptor-binding domains."
https://openalex.org/W2134090406,"The aims of the study were to meet the demand of new tubulin antagonists with fewer side effects by characterizing the antiangiogenic properties of the experimental compound spongistatin 1, and to elucidate nonmitotic mechanisms by which tubulin antagonists inhibit angiogenesis. Although tubulin-inhibiting drugs and their antiangiogenic properties have been investigated for a long time, surprisingly little is known about their underlying mechanisms of action. Antiangiogenic effects of spongistatin 1 were investigated in endothelial cells in vitro, including functional cell-based assays, live-cell imaging, and a kinome array, and in the mouse cornea pocket assay in vivo. Spongistatin 1 inhibited angiogenesis at nanomolar concentrations (IC(50): cytotoxicity>50 nM, proliferation 100 pM, migration 1.0 nM, tube formation 1.0 nM, chemotaxis 1.0 nM, aortic ring sprouting 500 pM, neovascularization in vivo 10 microg/kg). Further, a kinome array and validating data showed that spongistatin 1 inhibits the phosphorylation activity of protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha), an essential kinase in angiogenesis, and its translocation to the membrane. Thus, we conclude that PKCalpha might be an important target for the antiangiogenic effects of tubulin antagonism. In addition, the data from the kinase array suggest that different tubulin antagonists might have individual intracellular actions."
https://openalex.org/W1978416856,"The Río Tinto (RT) is distinguished from other acid mine drainage systems by its natural and ancient origins. Microbial life from all three domains flourishes in this ecosystem, but bacteria dominate metabolic processes that perpetuate environmental extremes. While the patchy geochemistry of the RT likely influences the dynamics of bacterial populations, demonstrating which environmental variables shape microbial diversity and unveiling the mechanisms underlying observed patterns, remain major challenges in microbial ecology whose answers rely upon detailed assessments of community structures coupled with fine-scale measurements of physico-chemical parameters.By using high-throughput environmental tag sequencing we achieved saturation of richness estimators for the first time in the RT. We found that environmental factors dictate the distribution of the most abundant taxa in this system, but stochastic niche differentiation processes, such as mutation and dispersal, also contribute to observed diversity patterns.We predict that studies providing clues to the evolutionary and ecological processes underlying microbial distributions will reconcile the ongoing debate between the Baas Becking vs. Hubbell community assembly hypotheses."
https://openalex.org/W2010988587,"JIPs (c-Jun N-terminal kinase interacting proteins), which scaffold JNK/p38 MAP kinase signaling modules, also bind conventional kinesins and are implicated in microtubule-based membrane trafficking in neuronal cells. Here we have identified a novel splice variant of the Jip4 gene product JLP(L) (JNK-interacting leucine zipper protein) in yeast-two hybrid screens with the phosphoinositide kinase PIKfyve. The interaction was confirmed by pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation assays in native cells. It engages the PIKfyve cpn60_TCP1 consensus sequence and the last 75 residues of the JLP C terminus. Subpopulations of both proteins cofractionated and populated similar structures at the cell perinuclear region. Because PIKfyve is essential in endosome-to-trans-Golgi network (TGN) cargo transport, we tested whether JLP is a PIKfyve functional partner in this trafficking pathway. Short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of endogenous JLP or PIKfyve profoundly delayed the microtubule-based transport of chimeric furin (Tac-furin) from endosomes to the TGN in a CHO cell line, which was rescued upon ectopic expression of siRNA-resistant JLP or PIKfyve constructs. Peptides from the contact sites in PIKfyve and JLP, or a dominant-negative PIKfyve mutant introduced into cells by ectopic expression or microinjection, induced a similar defect. Because Tac-TGN38 delivery from endosomes to the TGN, unlike that of Tac-furin, does not require intact microtubules, we monitored the effect of JLP and PIKfyve depletion or the interacting peptides administration on Tac-TGN38 trafficking. Remarkably, neither maneuver altered the Tac-TGN38 delivery to the TGN. Our data indicate that JLP interacts with PIKfyve and that both proteins and their association are required in microtubule-based, but not in microtubule-independent, endosome-to-TGN cargo transport."
https://openalex.org/W2061466854,"Numerous studies have shown that the active form of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3, can exert growth inhibitory effects on human breast cancer cells and mammary tumor growth. However, the molecular mechanisms remain to be fully delineated. This study demonstrates for the first time that CCAAT enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), a member of the C/EBP family of transcription factors, is induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 and is a potent enhancer of VDR transcription in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. 1,25(OH)2D3 was found to induce C/EBPα as well as VDR expression in MCF-7 cells.

Antiproliferative effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 and induction of VDR were observed in MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with C/EBPα, and knockdown of C/EBPα suppressed VDR and antiproliferative effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 in MCF-7 cells. Transfection of C/EBPα in MCF-7 cells resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of hVDR transcription.

(1Christakos S. Dhawan P. Liu Y. Peng X. Porta A. J. Cell Biochem... 2003; 88: 695-705Google Scholar). The actions of 1,25(OH)2D3 include not only maintenance of calcium homeostasis but also effects on numerous other systems, including effects on the immune system and the growth and differentiation of a number of malignant cells including breast cancer cells (1Christakos S. Dhawan P. Liu Y. Peng X. Porta A. J. Cell Biochem... 2003; 88: 695-705Google Scholar). 1,25(OH)2D3 acts by binding to a high affinity intracellular receptor protein (the vitamin D receptor or VDR). 1,25(OH)2D3 bound to the VDR heterodimerizes with the retinoid X receptor and along with coactivators and additional accessory nuclear proteins interacts with vitamin D response elements in the promoter of target genes and modulates their transcription (1Christakos S.

In vivo studies have suggested a role for vitamin D and 1,25(OH)2D3 in breast cancer prevention as well as in treatment of breast cancer. It has been demonstrated that rats fed diets low in vitamin D and calcium develop significantly more mammary tumors when treated with 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene than rats fed control diets with adequate vitamin D and calcium (2Jacobson E.A. James K.A. Newmark H.L. Carroll K.K. Cancer Res... 1989; 49: 6300-6303Google Scholar). In other in vivo studies using N-methyl-N-nitrosourea-treated rats 1,25(OH)2D3 or analogs of 1,25(OH)2D3 were found to inhibit the progression of mammary tumor growth (3Colston K.W. Chander S.K.

Although these studies provide compelling evidence for the use of 1,25(OH)2D3 or less calcemic analogs of 1,25(OH)2D3 that have similar growth-inhibitory effects, little is known about the mechanisms involved in mediating the cellular responsiveness to 1,25(OH)2D3 and the downstream targets involved. Recently, we reported that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) is a 1,25(OH)2D3 target gene in kidney and in osteoblastic cells (14Dhawan P. Peng X. Sutton A.L. MacDonald P.N. Croniger C.M.

It was suggested that C/EBPα could be considered a potential tumor suppression gene in breast cancer (22Gery S. Tanosaki S. Bose S. Bose N. Vadgama J. Koeffler H.P. Clin. Cancer Res... 2005; 11: 3184-3190Google Scholar). In our previous studies we found that C/EBPβ cooperates with VDR in 1,25(OH)2D3-induced transcription (14Dhawan P. Peng X. Sutton A.L. MacDonald P.N. Croniger C.M. Trautwein C. Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Christakos S. Mol. Cell Biol... 2005; 25: 472-487Google Scholar). In the present study we extend our initial observations in kidney and osteoblastic cells to cooperative effects between 1,25(OH)2D3 and the C/EBP family of transcription factors in breast cancer cells. We report for the first time that C/EBPα is induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and that C/EBPα cooperates with Brm, an ATPase that is a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, and is a potent enhancer of VDR transcription. The induction of C/EBPα is accompanied by induction of p21WAF1/Cip1 and p27Kip1. Because the levels of VDR correlate with the antiproliferative effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 and because 1,25(OH)2D3 and C/EBPα up-regulate p21, these findings provide important mechanisms whereby 1,25(OH)2D3 may act to inhibit growth of breast cancer cells. These findings also identify C/EBPα as a 1,25(OH)2D3 target in breast cancer cells and provide evidence for C/EBPα as a candidate for breast cancer treatment.

The deletion construct was prepared using KpnI and NotI and re-ligating the remaining promoter construct containing (-646/+60). The C/EBP site at -919/-911 was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis using a site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The oligonucleotides used to generate the C/EBPβ mutated site (shown in lowercase underlined letters; C/EBP site shown in bold) were as follows: 5′-CCA GAA GAT Tat gtt acg atT ACT ATT TAT TTA TAC-3′ and 5′-GTA TAA ATA AAT AGT Aat cgt aac aTA ATC TTC TGG. All these promoter constructs were used for transcription assays in MCF-7 cells. The C/EBPα promoter construct was kindly gifted by (A. Peres-Castillo, Madrid Spain) (24Menendez-Hurtado A. Santos A. Perez-Castillo A. Endocrinology.. 2000; 141: 4164-4170Google Scholar). The C/EBPα,-β, and -δ expression vectors were a gift of Simon Williams, Texas Tech University (Lubbock, TX). The dominant negative (DN) C/EBP construct was a gift from Dr. C. Vinson, NCI, National Institutes of Health. pCMV-Brm and pCMV-mutant Brm (with the ATPase site mutated, which acts as a dominant negative inhibitor) were obtained from M. Yaniv (25Muchardt C. Reyes J.C. Bourachot B. Leguoy E. Yaniv M. EMBO J.. 1996; 15: 3394-3402Google Scholar). pCMV-AML-1/ETO expression vector was from S. W. Hiebert (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN) Empty vectors were transfected to keep the total DNA concentration equal. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) treated as described under “Results” in the appropriate medium supplemented with 2% charcoal-dextran-treated FBS. After treatment with vehicle or the compounds noted at the concentrations and times indicated under “Results,” cells were harvested and dual luciferase assay was performed according to the Dual Luciferase assay kit manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). For experiments shown in Fig. 5, MDA-MB-231 cells were co-transfected with C/EBPα expression plasmid and green fluorescent protein expression plasmid with G418 resistance using Lipofectamine 2000 and incubated at 37 °C for 20 h. Control cells were transfected with vector alone. Normal growth medium (DMEM as indicated in “cell culture” above) was added the next day. Three days after transfection, selection began with increasing amounts of G418 to a final concentration of 600 μg/ml. After 2 weeks of G418 selection, cells were used for Western blot analysis, VDR transcription assays, and assessment of cell proliferation in the presence or absence of 1,25(OH)2D3. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized based on the region of the hVDR promoter containing the wild-type (-919/-911) or the mutated C/EBP site (prepared by the University of Medicine and Dentistry Molecular Resource Facility, Newark, NJ). The complementary oligonucleotides were annealed, end-radiolabeled, and purified as described before (14Dhawan P. Peng X. Sutton A.L. MacDonald P.N. Croniger C.M. Trautwein C. Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Christakos S. Mol. Cell Biol... 2005; 25: 472-487Google Scholar) and were used for the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used were 5′-CCA GAA GAT TAT GTT GTA ATT ACT ATT TAT TTA TAC-3′ and 5′-TAA ATA AAT AGT AAT TAC AAC ATA ATC TTC TGG-3′ for the wild-type and 5′-CCA GAA GAT TAT GTT ACG ATT ACT ATT TAT TTA TAC-3′ and 5′-GTA TAA ATA AAT AGT AAT CGT AAC ATA ATC TTC TGG-3′ for the mutant construct. Briefly, 5 μg of the nuclear preparations from C/EBPα-transfected MCF-7 cells were incubated for 20 min at 25 °C with 2 μg of poly(dI/dC) with or without unlabeled specific or nonspecific DNA competitor or C/EBPα antibody in binding buffer (4 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 60 mm KCl, 12% glycerol, 12 mm HEPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol). This was further incubated with 0.5 ng of the labeled oligonucleotide probe (∼100,000 cpm) and incubation for 30 min at 25 °C. The samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel that had been pre-electrophoresed for 30 min at 100 V/cm at 4 °C in 45 mm Tris-45 mm boric acid-1 mm EDTA. Electrophoresis was conducted for 2.5 h under identical conditions. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film at -80 °C with intensifying screens. siRNA Transfections—The following are the sequences of the oligonucleotides used to knockdown C/EBPα expression. C/EBPα siRNA sequences are as follows: sense, 5′-GUCGGCCAGGAACUCGUCGUU-3′ and antisense, 3′-UUCAGCCGGUCCUUGAGCAGC-3′. Scrambled siRNA sequences are as follows: sense, 5′-GUAGUCCAUGGACCCGUAGUU and antisense, 3′-UUCAUCAGGUACCUGGGCAUC-3′. siRNA transfections were done using Oligofectamine™ (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with C/EBPα siRNA following the manufacturer's instructions. One day prior to transfection, 5 × 104 cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates (corresponding to a density of 40% at the time of transfection) without antibiotics. The transfection mixture (containing 20 μm siRNA with Oligofectamine reagent) was added to the 6-well plate 20 min after mixture preparation. After 24–48 h of transfection the medium was changed to DMEM with 2% charcoal-stripped FBS. Transfected cells were treated with vehicle or 1,25(OH)2D3 for 24–72 h as described above. Cells were then harvested, and cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. Similarly transfected and treated cells were also used for preparation of nuclear extracts for Western blotting. Nuclear Extracts—For nuclear extract preparation from MCF-7 cells, cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, harvested by scraping, gently pelleted, washed, and lysed in hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride), protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg of pepstatin A per ml, 2 mg of leupeptin per ml, 2 mg of aprotinin per ml), and 1% Triton X-100. Nuclei were pelleted at 3,500 × g for 5 min, and cytoplasmic supernatants were separated. Nuclei were resuspended in hypertonic buffer containing 0.42 m NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, and the phosphatase and protease inhibitors indicated above. Soluble nuclear proteins were released by 60 min of incubation at 4 °C, and insoluble material was separated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The protein concentration of the supernatant was measured by using Bradford's method (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem... 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar), and aliquots were stored at -80 °C. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—Co-immunoprecipitation assay was performed as described previously (14Dhawan P. Peng X. Sutton A.L. MacDonald P.N. Croniger C.M. Trautwein C. Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Christakos S. Mol. Cell Biol... 2005; 25: 472-487Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts were isolated using the NEPER nuclear extraction reagents kit from Pierce. 1 μg of primary antibody (C/EBPα, or Brm) was added to the nuclear extract in 500 μl of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X 100) and incubated for 4 h to overnight with rotation at 4 °C. 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow Beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the nuclear extract-antibody mix, and it was further incubated with rotation at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min, the supernatant was discarded and the immunoprecipitated complex was washed with immunoprecipitation buffer three times, eluted and separated on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad). The Western blot was probed with Brm or C/EBPα antibody, respectively. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—MCF-7 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS to 95% confluence and then treated with vehicle or 1,25(OH)2D3 in medium supplemented with 2% charcoal-stripped serum under the conditions and for the times indicated. Treated cells were used for the ChIP assay performed as described earlier (27Liu Y. Shen Q. Malloy P.J. Soliman E. Peng X. Kim S. Pike J.W. Feldman D. Christakos S. J. Bone Miner Res... 2005; 20: 1680-1691Google Scholar, 28Shen Q. Christakos S. J. Biol. Chem... 2005; 280: 40589-40598Google Scholar). In brief, treated cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and cross-link using 1% formaldehyde for 15 min. Glycine was added to a final concentration of 0.125 m to stop cross-linking. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected by scraping. The cells were lysed for 20 min each first in buffer 1 (5 mm Pipes, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and then in buffer 2 (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). The resulting chromatin pellet was sonicated to an average DNA size of 500-bp DNA (evaluated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis) using a Fisher model 100 sonic dismembranator at a power setting of 1. The sonicated extract was centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C and then diluted into ChIP dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA). Immunoprecipitations were performed at 4 °C overnight with the indicated antibody. After a 1-h incubation with salmon sperm DNA and bovine serum albumin-pretreated Zysorbin (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA), the precipitates were collected by centrifugation. Precipitates were washed sequentially in buffer I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), buffer II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and twice in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA). The protein-DNA was then eluted by using 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3 for 15 min twice. Cross-links were reversed by incubating at 65 °C overnight in elution buffer with 0.2 m NaCl. DNA fragments were purified using Qiagen QIAquick PCR purification kits, and PCR was performed using the primers designed to amplify fragments of human VDR promoter C/EBP motif (upper, 5′-GAGGCGAATAGCAATATCTTCC-3′; lower, 5′-GAGACCTGGAATTGTGGATGG-3′). PCR analysis was performed in the linear range of DNA amplification. 248-bp PCR products were resolved in 1% agarose gel and visualized using ethidium bromide staining. DNA obtained before precipitation was used as the input. 10% of input was used for PCR reaction. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as means ± S.E., and significance was determined by analysis by Student's t test for two-group comparison or by analysis of variance for multiple-group comparison. C/EBPα Expression Is Induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 in MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells—Shown in Fig. 1A is the 1,25(OH)2D3-induced inhibition of MCF-7 cell proliferation. Because C/EBPα has been reported to have a growth inhibitory role in breast cancer (22Gery S. Tanosaki S. Bose S. Bose N. Vadgama J. Koeffler H.P. Clin. Cancer Res... 2005; 11: 3184-3190Google Scholar), we tested the possibility that 1,25(OH)2D3 may regulate the expression of C/EBPα in breast cancer cells. When MCF-7 breast cancer cells were treated with 1,25(OH)2D3 (10 nm for 8–24 h), Western blot analysis, using nuclear extracts from the vehicle or 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells, showed that 1,25(OH)2D3 induced C/EBPα expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (Fig. 1B, left panel; maximum induction, 4.2-fold). The induction of C/EBPα by 1,25(OH)2D3 in MCF-7 cells was accompanied by an increase in the expression of VDR (maximum 3.7-fold at 24 h) (Fig. 1B, left panel). A dose response of the stimulation by 1,25(OH)2D3 (1–100 nm for 24 h), shown in Fig. 1B (right panel), similarly indicates that induction of C/EBPα by 1,25(OH)2D3 is accompanied by an increase in VDR. C/EBPβ is not induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 in MCF-7 cells (not shown). Induction of C/EBPα mRNA by 1,25(OH)2D3 in MCF-7 cells is shown in Fig. 1C. 1,25(OH)2D3 also enhanced the expression of p21WAF1/Cip1 and p27Kip1 in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1D). To examine a possible mechanism of regulation of C/EBPα by 1,25(OH)2D3 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, MCF-7 cells were transfected with the rat C/EBPα promoter (-1171/+23) and treated with 1,25(OH)2D3. 1,25(OH)2D3 failed to show any effect on the activity of the C/EBPα promoter (Fig. 1E). The C/EBPα promoter was also unresponsive to 1,25(OH)2D3 when VDR-transfected COS-7 cells were used (not shown). As a positive control, MCF-7 cells were transfected with C/EBPβ expression vector. C/EBPβ significantly induced C/EBPα transcription 5.5-fold (p < 0.01 compared with cells transfected with vector alone; Fig. 1E). The unresponsiveness of the C/EBPα promoter to 1,25(OH)2D3 (similar to what we observed using the C/EBPβ promoter and transfection in osteoblastic cells (14Dhawan P. Peng X. Sutton A.L. MacDonald P.N. Croniger C.M. Trautwein C. Centrella M. McCarthy T.L. Christakos S. Mol. Cell Biol... 2005; 25: 472-487Google Scholar)) suggests the possibility that C/EBPα is regulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 at other sites yet to be defined or that 1,25(OH)2D3 may be regulating C/EBPα at a post transcriptional level. Enhancement of VDR Transcription by C/EBPα in MCF-7 Cells—Because the induction by 1,25(OH)2D3 of C/EBPα is accompanied by an increase in VDR (Fig. 1B) and because sequence analysis of the hVDR promoter revealed the presence of a putative C/EBP site at -919/-911 and two CRE sites at -571/-567 and -361/-357 (Fig. 2A (29Miyamoto K. Kesterson R.A. Yamamoto H. Taketani Y. Nishiwaki E. Tatsumi S. Inoue Y. Morita K. Takeda E. Pike J.W. Mol. Endocrinol... 1997; 11: 1165-1179Google Scholar)) (C/EBP family members have been reported to bind to a CRE or a C/EBP site (30Wilson H.L. Roesler W.J. Mol. Cell Endocrinol... 2002; 188: 15-20Google Scholar)), the possibility that C/EBPα may have a role in the 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated enhancement of VDR in MCF-7 breast cancer cells was examined. MCF-7 cells were co-transfected with hVDR promoter (-1500/+60) and C/EBPα expression vector. A dose-dependent enhancement of hVDR transcription by C/EBPα was observed (maximum enhancement of 11 ± 1.2-fold at 0.25 μg of C/EBPα (Fig. 2B)). Unlike C/EBPα, C/EBPβ or C/EBPδ had no effect on VDR transcription (Fig. 2B). To further confirm the role of C/EBPα as an enhancer of the hVDR transcription, MCF-7 cells were transfected with the hVDR promoter (-1500/+60) in the presence of C/EBPα expression vector and dominant negative C/EBP (DN C/EBP). DN C/EBP, which lacks the transactivation domain sequence but retains the dimerization and DNA binding domain, suppressed the C/EBPα mediated enhancement of hVDR transcription in MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). AML-ETO has earlier been reported to block C/EBPα DNA binding and transactivation (31Pabst T. Mueller B.U. Harakawa N. Schoch C. Haferlach T. Behre G. Hiddemann W. Zhang D.E. Tenen D.G. Nat. Med... 2001; 7: 444-451Google Scholar). Increasing concentrations of AML-ETO also suppressed the C/EBPα mediated activation of the hVDR promoter (Fig. 2D). These results indicate, for the first time, the involvement of C/EBPα in VDR transcription in MCF-7 cells. Identification of the C/EBPα Activation Domain in the VDR Promoter—Sequences in the hVDR promoter involved in transactivation by C/EBP were identified by deletion mutant analysis and site-directed mutagenesis. Deletion of the hVDR promoter to -646 (DEL C/EBP) eliminated the ability of C/EPBα to transactivate the hVDR promoter, suggesting the involvement of the site at -919/-911 in the induction by C/EBPα of hVDR transcription (Fig. 3, A and B). To investigate the specific contribution of this element to the induction of hVDR transcription by C/EBPα, a mutant hVDR promoter construct was generated with the C/EBP site at -919/-911 mutated (MT CEBP). Mutation of this site within the -1500/+60 promoter construct blocked the C/EBPα-mediated induction of transcription (Fig. 3B), suggesting that C/EBPα acts through this site to induce hVDR transcription. Gel mobility shift assays were performed using synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to the wild-type (-919/-911) C/EBP binding sequences and nuclear extracts from control and 1,25(OH)2D3-treated MCF-7 cells transfected with C/EBPα. An interaction of MCF-7 cell nuclear extract with this element was observed and binding was enhanced in the presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 3). A supershift was observed in the presence of C/EBPα antibody, indicating the specificity of this interaction for C/EBPα (Fig. 3C, lanes 4 and 6). Binding was competed by excess cold oligonucleotide, confirming specificity (Fig. 3C, lanes 5 and 7). C/EBPα failed to bind to mutant radiolabeled oligonucleotide, and the oligonucleotide containing the mutated C/EBP sequences could not deplete the binding of C/EBPα to the labeled WT probe (not shown). RNA Interference Knockdown of C/EBPα Reduces the Anti-proliferative Effect of 1,25(OH)2D3 in MCF-7 Cells—MCF-7 cells were transfected with C/EBPα siRNA or scrambled siRNA (Fig. 4A). C/EBPα siRNA transfection reduced the expression of C/EBPα as well as VDR protein in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4B). Treatment of MCF-7 cells or control transfected MCF-7 cells (scrambled siRNA) with 10 nm 1,25(OH)2D3 decreased the number of the viable cell"
https://openalex.org/W2147582518,"Background Centrioles are microtubule-based cylindrical structures composed of nine triplet tubules and are required for the formation of the centrosome, flagella and cilia. Despite theirs importance, centriole biogenesis is poorly understood. Centrosome duplication is initiated at the G1/S transition by the sequential recruitment of a set of conserved proteins under the control of the kinase Plk4. Subsequently, the procentriole is assembled by the polymerization of centriolar tubules via an unknown mechanism involving several tubulin paralogs. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we developed a cellular assay to study centrosome duplication and procentriole stability based on its sensitivity to the microtubule-depolymerizing drug nocodazole. By using RNA interference experiments, we show that the stability of growing procentrioles is regulated by the microtubule-stabilizing protein CAP350, independently of hSAS-6 and CPAP which initiate procentriole growth. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the critical role of centriolar tubule stability for an efficient procentriole growth. Conclusions/Significance CAP350 belongs to a new class of proteins which associate and stabilize centriolar tubules to control centriole duplication."
https://openalex.org/W2022292568,"Spy1A is a cyclin-like protein required for progression through the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. Elevated Spy1A protein levels have been implicated in tumorigenesis and are attributed to overriding the DNA damage response and enhancing cell proliferation. Understanding how Spy1A is produced and degraded is essential in resolving how it contributes to normal and abnormal growth processes. Herein, we demonstrate that Spy1A is degraded in a cell cycle-dependent manner during mitosis via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We have resolved the E3 ligase and essential phosphorylation sites mediating Spy1A degradation. Furthermore, we have determined that non-degradable forms of Spy1A do not trigger cell cycle arrest but, rather, contribute to uncontrolled cell growth. Further investigation into the regulation of Spy1A may reveal novel strategies for understanding the etiology and progression of specific growth disorders.

Members of the Speedy/RINGO family are unique cyclin-like regulators of the cell division cycle. There are now five members characterized in mammals exhibiting distinct tissue expression patterns and functional specificity (1Cheng A. Xiong W. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Solomon M.J. Cell Cycle.. 2005; 4: 155-165Google Scholar). The originally characterized family member Spy1A1, herein referred to as Spy1A, is expressed constitutively in most human tissues; it shortens the G1/S transition through activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) 4The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; HA, hemagglutinin; si-, small interfering; Ub, ubiquitin; Nedd4, neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated-4; DM, deletion mutant; LLNL, N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norleucinal; wt, wild type; BES, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminotehane sulfonic acid. and is essential for cell proliferation to occur (2Porter L.A.

Activation of CDKs by Spy1/RINGO proteins is thought to occur in an atypical fashion, independent of cyclin binding and in the absence of CDK phosphorylation within the T-loop (3Karaiskou A. Perez L.H. Ferby I. Ozon R. Jessus C. Nebreda A.R. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 36028-36034Google Scholar). Spy1A can also act in a unique fashion to prevent inhibition of CDK2 by p27Kip1 (p27); this occurs through direct interactions with the p27 protein and results in enhanced degradation of p27 (4Porter L.A. Kong M. Donoghue D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell.. 2003; 14: 3664-3674Google Scholar, 5McAndrew C.W. Gastwirt R.F. Meyer A.N. Porter L.A. Donoghue D.J. Cell Cycle.. 2007; 6: 1937-1945Google Scholar). At a cellular level Spy1A also plays a role in the DNA damage response, functioning to enhance cell survival and promote cell proliferation in lieu of apoptosis (6Barnes E.A. Porter L.A.

Hence, determining how Spy1A protein levels are regulated may reveal novel information regarding the dynamics of cell cycle control during normal and abnormal growth conditions. In mammals Spy1A mRNA is known to be up-regulated during G1/S; however, regulation at the protein level has not been studied (2Porter L.A. Dellinger R.W. Tynan J.A. Barnes E.A. Kong M. Lenormand J.L. Donoghue D.J. J. Cell Biol... 2002; 157: 357-366Google Scholar). The Xenopus homologue of Spy1A, X-Spy1, has been shown to undergo steps of proteasome-dependent processing and degradation in a manner dependent on the initiation and progression of meiotic events (10Gutierrez G.J. Vogtlin A. Castro A. Ferby I. Salvagiotto G. Ronai Z. Lorca T. Nebreda A.R. Nat. Cell Biol... 2006; 8: 1084-1094Google Scholar). Degradation of X-Spy1 occurs after meiosis I and is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Siah-2; this depends on phosphorylation of X-Spy1 on a C-terminal residue Ser-243 (10Gutierrez G.J. Vogtlin A. Castro A. Ferby I. Salvagiotto G. Ronai Z. Lorca T. Nebreda A.R. Nat. Cell Biol... 2006; 8: 1084-1094Google Scholar). Cyclin proteins in general are tightly regulated temporally and spatially through the cell cycle, controlled on a fundamental level by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is the primary mechanism involved in the selective degradation of intracellular and membrane-bound proteins, and aberrations in this critically important system are correlated to many diseases including cancer (11Chen C. Seth A.K. Aplin A.E. Mol. Cancer Res... 2006; 4: 695-707Google Scholar, 12Robinson P.A. Ardley H.C. J. Cell Sci... 2004; 117: 5191-5194Google Scholar). Ubiquitination involves the conjugation of ubiquitin to a substrate protein via a concerted effort from three classes of enzymes: the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, and the ubiquitin-protein ligase E3 (13Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1992; 61: 761-807Google Scholar). The E3 enzyme catalyzes the formation of a chain of ubiquitin molecules which then targets the substrate protein for degradation by the 26 S proteasome (12Robinson P.A. Ardley H.C. J. Cell Sci... 2004; 117: 5191-5194Google Scholar, 14Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1998; 67: 425-479Google Scholar, 15Shearwin-Whyatt L. Dalton H.E. Foot N. Kumar S. BioEssays.. 2006; 28: 617-628Google Scholar). Given the functional cyclin-like properties of Spy1A, it is a valid hypothesis that Spy1A may also be subject to a cell cycle-dependent ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis; however, whether the mammalian somatic cell cycle regulates this critical protein in the same manner as that seen during oocyte maturation in Xenopus warrants investigation. Herein we demonstrate that Spy1A is ubiquitinated and degraded during G2/M phase of the cell cycle. We have determined three key amino acids within the N-terminal region of Spy1A which are essential to support regulated degradation of the protein, and we have demonstrated that the C-terminal region, known to regulate X-Spy1 degradation, is dispensable for degradation of the mammalian homologue. We have resolved that the E3 ligase neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated-4 (Nedd4) is capable of binding to Spy1A and that dominant negative forms and knockdown of Nedd4 reduce ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Spy1A. Furthermore, we show that non-degradable forms of Spy1A do not trigger intrinsic cell cycle checkpoints but, rather, promote cell proliferation; demonstration that this mechanism may contribute to tumorigenesis. Cell Culture—Human mammary breast cancer cells, MCF7 (ATCC), and human embryonic kidney cells, HEK293 (293; ATCC), were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) containing 2 mm l-glutamine (Sigma), penicillin, and streptomycin (Invitrogen) and were cultured in a 5% CO2 environment. MCF7 cells were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Sigma), and 293 cells were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmids and Mutagenesis—The Nedd4-PCEP plasmid (Nedd4), dominant negative Nedd4-PCEP plasmid (Nedd4DN), and empty vector control (PCEP) were provided by Dr. Dale S. Haines (Temple University School of Medicine). HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub) was provided by Dr. Sylvain Meloche (Université de Montréal). siRNA against Nedd4-1 was synthesized by inserting the oligo 5′-GATGAAGCCACCATGTATA into the pSUPER-basic vector, as previously described (16Pak Y. Glowacka W.K. Bruce M.C. Pham N. Rotin D. J. Cell Biol... 2006; 175: 631-645Google Scholar). As a control, LacZ siRNA (siCntl) was synthesized and inserted into pSUPER-basic vector as described (19Wang X. Trotman L.C. Koppie T. Alimonti A. Chen Z. Gao Z. Wang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. Jiang X. Cell.. 2007; 128: 129-139Google Scholar). Creation of Myc-Spy1A-PCS3 vector was described previously (2Porter L.A. Dellinger R.W. Tynan J.A. Barnes E.A. Kong M. Lenormand J.L. Donoghue D.J. J. Cell Biol... 2002; 157: 357-366Google Scholar). QuikChange multi-site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to incorporate new silent sites into the original Spy1-pJT0013 vector (2Porter L.A. Dellinger R.W. Tynan J.A. Barnes E.A. Kong M. Lenormand J.L. Donoghue D.J. J. Cell Biol... 2002; 157: 357-366Google Scholar) to facilitate the cloning of deletion mutants A (DMA), B (DMB), C (DMC), G (DMG), and Z (DMZ). A BglII site was inserted by altering nucleotide 256 from T to C using the primers A043 (5′-GACGATTTAATTCAAGATCTCTTGTGGATGGACTGCTGC-3′) and A044 (5′-GCAGCAGTCCATCCACAAGAGATCTTGAATTAAATCGTC-3′) to construct the pRA01 vector. Using the pRA01 plasmid, an Mlu site was also added by altering nucleotide 175 from C to G using A004 (5′-CAACAAATCTAAACGCGTCAAAGGACCTTGTCTGG-3′) and A005 (′-CCAGACAAGGTCCTTTGACGCGTTTAGATTTGTTG-3′) to make the vector pRA02. The pRS2 vector was constructed from Spy1-pJT0013 by creating an NdeI site just after the stop codon using the primers A045 (′-GTCTTGTGTCCATATGTGTTTTGTGGTGACCC-3′) and A046 (5′-GGGTCACCACAAAACACATATGGACACAAGAC-3′). The pRS1 vector was constructed by creating a MluI site in the Spy1-pJT0013 plasmid by altering nucleotide 175 from C to G using primers A004 (5′-CAACAAATCTAAACGCGTCAAAGGACCTTGTCTGG-3′) and A005 (5′-CCAGACAAGGTCCTTTGACGCGTTTAGATTTGTTG-3′). DMA was created by digesting wild-type Spy1A (in pRS1) with NdeI and MluI to remove the first 57 amino acids of the protein. DMB was created by digesting wild-type Spy1A (in pRA02) with MluI and BglII to remove 27 amino acids. Deletion mutant C was created by digesting wild-type Spy1A (in pRA01) with BglII and NcoI to remove 61 amino acids. Deletion mutant G was created by digesting wild-type Spy1A (in pJT0013) with NcoI and BbsI to remove 94 amino acids. Finally, DMZ was created by digesting wild-type Spy1A (in pRS1) with BbsI and NdeI to remove the last 47 amino acids. Gel electrophoresis of these digestions was run on a 1% agarose gel; the desired band was excised and gel-extracted (Bio Basics) for ligation using T4 DNA ligase (Fermentas). For all five deletion mutants, linkers containing a silent restriction site, PstI, and complementary sticky ends were designed, commercially synthesized (Sigma), annealed, and utilized in the ligations. In each case 20-μl ligation reactions were carried out at 22 °C for 2–4 h containing a 1:3 vector to linker ratio. Ligations were transformed into DH5α cells and selected for ampicillin resistance, mini-prepped, and digested with PstI (Fermentas) to detect the correct ligation. The five Spy1A deletion mutants (depicted in Fig. 3A), spanning the length of the gene, were moved from the pJT0013 into pCS3 using EcoRI and XbaI sites flanking the gene. Multi-site-directed mutagenesis was also carried out using the PCS3 vector to generate the Spy1A-T15A, Spy1A-T33A, Spy1A-S22A, and Spy1A-S247A mutants. Spy1A-T15A was designed using the primers A151 (5′-GAGACACCACCTACTGTCGCTGTTTATGTAAAATCAG-3′) and A152 (5′-CTGATTTTACATAAACAGCGACAGTAGGTGGTGTCTC-3′); Spy1A-T33A was designed using the primers A-153 (5′-CAGCCTAAAAAGCCCATTGCACTGAAGCGTCCTATTTG-3′) and A154 (5′-CAAATAGGACGCTTCAGTGCAATGGGCTTTTTAGGCTG-3′); Spy1A-S22A was designed using the primers A139 (5′-GTTTATGTAAAATCAGGGGCCAATAGATCACATCAGC-3′) and A140 (5′-CTGATGTGATCTATTGGCCCCTGATTTTACATAAAC-3); Spy1A-S247A was designed using the primers A143 (5′-GGATTGTCTTCATCATCAGCGTTATCCAGTCATACTGCAGGGGTG-3′) and A144 (5′-CACCCCTGCAGTATGACTGGATAACGCTGATGATGAAGACAATCC-3′). Successful cloning in all cases was determined by DNA sequencing (Robarts Sequencing Facility; University of Western Ontario). Inhibitors and Antibodies—The following antibodies were used: Spy1A (NB 100-2521; Novus), Nedd4 (ab14592; Abcam), Myc (9E10 and C19; Santa Cruz), HA (Y11 and F7; Santa Cruz), actin (MAB1501R; Chemicon), cyclin E (551157; BD Pharmingen), IgG (SC66186; Santa Cruz). The following inhibitors were used: N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-norleucinal (LLNL; Sigma A6060); MG132 (Sigma C2211); cyclohexamide (Sigma C7698); nocodazole (Sigma M1404), thymidine (Sigma T1895), and lactacystin (Boston Biochem I-116). Transfections—Calcium phosphate precipitation transfections were carried using 10–12 μg of DNA per 10-cm tissue culture plate. 250 μl of CaCl2 was incubated with the DNA for 30 s, 250 μl of 2 × BBS (50 mm BES, 280 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm NaHPO4) at pH 7.01 was added while vortexing, and the solution was incubated for 10 min. The mixture was added slowly to the cells and then incubated in 3% CO2 for 12–16 h. The medium was then changed, and plates were returned to 5% CO2 for at least 12 h before harvest. Cell Synchronization and Flow Cytometry—293 cells were synchronized using a double thymidine block. Briefly, cells were cultured in medium containing 2 mm thymidine for 16 h followed by release into normal medium for 8 h and then a second thymidine block for 14 h and then released into medium containing 70 ng/ml nocodazole (with or without 10 μm MG132 as indicated). MCF7 cells were synchronized by being cultured in a serum-free medium for 48 h followed by release into medium containing serum and 70 ng/ml nocodazole. 293 and MCF7 cells were trypsinized at specified times, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and then either used immediately or fixed and stored at –20 °C. Fixation was carried out by resuspending cells at 2 × 106 cells in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline followed by slow addition of an equal amount of 100% ethanol. Within 1 week fixed cells were pelleted, washed, and resuspended in 300 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Samples were then prepared for flow cytometry by treating with 1 μl of 10 mg/ml stock of DNase free RNase (Sigma) and 50μl of 500 mg/ml propidium iodide stock solution. Data were collected using a Beckman Coulter FC500 (Biology Department, University of Windsor), and cell cycle profiles were analyzed using CXP Beckman Coulter FC500 software. Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in 0.1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m EDTA, 5 m NaCl) containing protease inhibitors (100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin) for 30 min on ice. Bradford reagent was used to determine the protein concentration following the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Aliquots of lysates containing 20–30 μg of protein were subjected to electrophoresis on denaturing 10–12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Polyvinylidene Fluoride-Plus transfer membranes (Osmonics Inc.) for 2 h at 30 V using a wet transfer method. Blots were blocked for 2 h in Tris-buffered Tween containing 3% nonfat dry milk (blocker) at room temperature. Primary antibodies were reconstituted in blocker and incubated overnight at 4 °C at a 1:1000 dilution for all antibodies, and secondary antibodies were used at a 1:10,000 dilution in blocker for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed 3 times with Tris-buffered Tween after incubation with both the primary and secondary antibodies. Washes were 6 min each after the primary antibody and 10 min each after the secondary antibody. Chemiluminescent peroxidase substrate was used for visualization following the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Chemiluminescence was quantified on an Alpha Innotech HD2 (Fisher) using AlphaEase FC software. Immunoprecipitation reactions were carried out using equal amounts of protein (∼200 μg/ml) incubated with 2 μg of primary antisera as indicated overnight at 4 °C. This was followed by the addition of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) and incubated at 4 °C with gentle rotation for an additional 2 h. Complexes were washed extensively with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. In Vivo Labeling—293 cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 and 70 ng/ml nocodazole for 14 h followed by incubation in phosphate-free media for 2 h, and cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (0.3 mCi/ml) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 4 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with Myc antisera. Immunoprecipitations were washed rigorously with Tris-buffered Tween, and samples were analyzed by 10% SDS page gel. Gels transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were visualized using Cyclone storage phosphor system and quantified using OptiQuant software (PerkinElmer and Biology Department, University of Windsor). In Vivo Ubiquitination Assays—293 cells were plated and transfected appropriately in a 100-mm dish. 24 h after transfection cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 for 14 h. Cells were then collected, pelleted by centrifugation, lysed in 200 μl of preboiled lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and further boiled for an additional 10 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm on a microcentrifuge for 10 min. Supernatant was diluted 10 times with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody. Spy1A Protein Levels Are Regulated in a Cell Cycle-dependent Fashion—MCF7 and 293 cells were blocked in G1 using serum starvation and thymidine block procedures, respectively. Cells were released into serum, and nocodazole-containing media and populations enriched in G1 or G2/M phases of the cell cycle were collected as determined by flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 1, A and C). Cell lysates from the respective populations were immunoblotted for endogenous Spy1A expression (Fig. 1, B and D, upper panels). Cyclin E was utilized as a control for the cell cycle stage (Fig. 1B, middle panel), and actin was used as the loading control (Fig. 1, B and D, lower panels). These data demonstrate that Spy1A protein levels are greatly decreased during G2/M phase of the cell cycle and support that, like many important cell cycle proteins, Spy1A is tightly regulated in a cell cycle-dependent fashion. Spy1A Degradation Depends on Phosphorylation within the N-terminal Region—Using a panel of Spy1A deletion mutants (Fig. 2A), we began to narrow down the region within the Spy1A protein that was necessary for degradation. We first determined whether deletion of any of the regions of Spy1A would result in stabilization of the protein. 293 cells were transfected with wild-type Spy1A or deleted versions of the Spy1A protein, DMA-DMZ. Cells were synchronized at G2/M, and levels of Spy1A were monitored by immunoblotting (Fig. 2B; upper left panel). All deletion mutants of Spy1A were degraded by G2/M phase with the exception of the mutant lacking the first 57 amino acids (DMA). Asynchronous cells demonstrate that all deletion mutants were expressed (Fig. 2B; upper right panel). Collectively, these data demonstrate that the N-terminal region of Spy1A is essential to mediate degradation of the protein and that unlike the Xenopus homolog of Spy1 the C-terminal region is dispensable for degradation. Phosphorylation is often the key event regulating recognition of the substrate protein by the E3 (11Chen C. Seth A.K. Aplin A.E. Mol. Cancer Res... 2006; 4: 695-707Google Scholar). To determine whether deletion of the N-terminal region of Spy1A altered the phosphorylation status of the protein, orthophosphate labeling was performed on G2 populations of cells expressing either wild-type or Spy1A deleted of its N-terminal region (DMA) in the presence of MG132. Over three experiments a significant decrease in the incorporation of orthophosphate was repeatedly observed when the N-terminal region of Spy1A was deleted (Fig. 2C). From this information, we conclude that there is at least one phosphorylation site present within the N-terminal region of Spy1A that may play a significant role in regulating Spy1A stability. Spy1A Steady State Levels Are Proteasome-dependent—After determining the timing of Spy1A degradation during cell cycle progression, we set out to investigate the mechanism by which this occurs. To determine whether this mechanism was proteasome-dependent we studied 293 cells in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitors MG132, lactacystin, and the calpain inhibitor LLNL. Spy1A protein levels were significantly elevated in the presence of MG132 as well as lactacystin but not in the presence of the calpain inhibitor or the vehicle controls (Fig. 3A, upper panel; ETOH, vehicle for LLNL; DMSO, vehicle for MG132 and lactacystin). These data imply that Spy1A abundance is proteasome-dependent. 293 cells were then utilized for an in vivo ubiquitination assay where cells were transiently transfected with HA-Ub and Myc-tagged Spy1A (Myc-Spy1A) in the presence of MG132 followed by immunoprecipitation with α-Myc (Fig. 3B, lower panel). Immunoblotting with α-HA revealed that Spy1A was labeled with HA-ubiquitin in vivo (Fig. 3B, upper panel). The experiment was then repeated using endogenous Spy1A and immunoprecipitation with α-HA. Immunoblotting with α-Spy1A revealed that Spy1A was indeed labeled with HA-ubiquitin in vivo (Fig. 3C, upper panel). Collectively these results demonstrate that Spy1 protein levels are regulated via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. To determine whether the stability shown by DMA is due to lack of ubiquitination, 293 cells were utilized in an in vivo ubiquitination assay. Cells were transiently transfected with HA-Ub and either Myc-tagged Spy1A (Myc-Spy1A), DMA, or DMB in the presence of MG132 followed by immunoprecipitation with α-Myc (Fig. 3D, lower panel). Immunoblotting with α-HA revealed that Spy1A and TMB were labeled with HA-ubiquitin in vivo, whereas TMA was not. This result demonstrates that lack of ubiquitination is responsible for the stability of the N-terminal deletion of Spy1A. The E3 Ligase Nedd4 Regulates Spy1A Degradation—There are many different E3 ubiquitin ligase enzymes that are able to function in the ubiquitination pathway. To determine which E3 ligase functions in the degradation of Spy1A, a protein blast for the N-terminal region of Spy1A revealed a weak potential interaction region for WW domain containing proteins, PPXXXXY spanning from Pro-11 to Tyr-17 in the Spy1A sequence. Immunoprecipitation with endogenous Spy1A followed by Coomassie staining revealed a predominant band enriched in G2 populations of cells at ∼110–115 kDa (data not shown). It is known that the 114-kDa WW domain-containing ligase Nedd4 (product of neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated gene 4), although preferring the canonical PPXY sequence, also binds to a variety of proline-rich regions with phosphorylated threonine or serine residues to trigger ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (15Shearwin-Whyatt L. Dalton H.E. Foot N. Kumar S. BioEssays.. 2006; 28: 617-628Google Scholar, 17Harvey K.F. Kumar S. Trends Cell Biol... 1999; 9: 166-169Google Scholar, 18Sutterluty H. Chatelain E. Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Senften M. Muller U. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol... 1999; 1: 207-214Google Scholar). Because of this we investigated the potential role of Nedd4 in Spy1A degradation. Interestingly, Nedd4 is a family of conserved E3 ubiquitin ligases found to function as both proto-oncogenes as well as tumor suppressors. Nedd4 is known to mono-, di-, and polyubiquitinate its target proteins, where polyubiquitinated proteins are selectively targeted for degradation by the proteasome (19Wang X. Trotman L.C. Koppie T. Alimonti A. Chen Z. Gao Z. Wang J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Cordon-Cardo C. Pandolfi P.P. Jiang X. Cell.. 2007; 128: 129-139Google Scholar). Clarifying the biology of the Nedd4 family and relevant substrates may provide important information for tumorigenesis (19Wang X. Trotman L.C. Koppie T. Alimonti A. Chen Z. Gao Z. Wang J.

Co-immunoprecipitation of lysates overexpressing exogenous Nedd4 as well as Myc-Spy1A in the presence of MG132 demonstrates that Nedd4 interacts with Spy1A in vivo (Fig. 4A). These results were then confirmed by using endogenous binding in two different cell lines 293 and NIH3T3 (Fig. 4B). To further investigate whether Nedd4 functions as a ubiquitin ligase for Spy1A, we repeated the co-immunoprecipitation experiment using overexpression of wild-type Nedd4 or dominant negative Nedd4 (Nedd4DN) in the presence of HA-Ub and MG132. Nedd4DN contains a single amino acid substitution that prevents the formation of a thioester bond with ubiquitin and, hence, renders Nedd4 inactive (12Robinson P.A. Ardley H.C. J. Cell Sci... 2004; 117: 5191-5194Google Scholar, 14Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 1998; 67: 425-479Google Scholar, 15Shearwin-Whyatt L. Dalton H.E. Foot N. Kumar S. BioEssays.. 2006; 28: 617-628Google Scholar). Immunoblotting for Spy1A followed by quantification revealed that HA-Ub incorporation was significantly decreased in the presence of Nedd4DN (Fig. 4C). To further establish whether Nedd4-1 was required for both binding and degradation of Spy1A, 293 cells were transfected with either siNedd4 or an siRNA control (siLacZ; siCntl) followed by immunoblotting with α-Nedd4 (Fig. 4D, upper panel), α-Spy1A (Fig. 4D, middle panel, and α-actin (Fig. 4D, lower panel). Densitometry of detected bands over three separate experiments demonstrate that Spy1A protein levels accumulate when Nedd4 levels are reduced with siRNA. To examine the effect of knockdown of Nedd4-1 on Spy1A-Nedd4 binding, 293 lysates overexpressing Myc-Spy1A and either siNedd4 or siCntl were immunoprecipitated with α-Myc (Fig. 4E, left panels). Immunoblotting with α-Nedd4 shows that Nedd4-Spy1 binding was significantly reduced after knockdown of Nedd4-1 (Fig. 4E, upper panel). To assess the effect of Nedd4 on endogenous Spy1A, Nedd4 was transfected into 293 cells in the presence and absence of MG132, and endogenous levels of Spy1A were measured. Overall Spy1A protein levels were consistently decreased in 2 separate experiments by at least 20% when Nedd4 was transiently transfected in the absence of MG132 as compared with when MG132 was present (Fig. 4F). To confirm the effect of Nedd4DN and siNedd4 on Spy1 protein stability, Nedd4DN or siNedd4wt-Nedd4 and Myc-Spy1A were transfected into 293 cells. 12 h post-transfection cells were released, and at 16 h post-transfection 50 μg/ml cycloheximide was added to prevent de novo protein synthesis. Over three separate experiments immunoblotting for Spy1A followed by quantification showed that wt-Spy1 had a half-life of ∼1 h and that stability was decreased significantly in the presence of Nedd4 but was significantly more stable in the cells transfected with Nedd4DN and siNedd4 (Fig. 4, G and H). Collectively, these data demonstrate a novel relationship between two proteins previously implicated in tumorigenesis, Spy1A and Nedd4.FIGURE 4The E3 ligase Nedd4 regulates degradation of Spy1A. A, 293 cells were transfected with empty vectors (PCS3 or PCEP), Nedd4-PCEP (Nedd4), or Myc-Spy1A-PCS3 (Myc-Spy1A) and treated with MG132 for 14 h before harvest. α-Myc immunoprecipitations (IP) were immunoblotted (IB) withα-Nedd4 (upper panel) and α-Myc (lower panel). Lysates from NIH3T3 cells served as positive control for Nedd4 expression (+, lane 5).

The CDT1-interacting protein, Geminin, together with CDK activity, prevents the firing of the same origin of replication during S-G2 phases, assuring that each portion of the DNA is replicated once and only once per cell cycle (26Machida Y.J.

The function of pre-RC components during S phase has not been clearly elucidated. It is known that the pre-RCs are disassembled as cells exit S phase, and only ORC proteins remain on the site to establish a complex, the so-called post-replicative complex (post-RC), representing a landing platform for pre-RC formation at the following M-G1 transition (3Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem... 2002; 71: 333-374Google Scholar). MCM proteins have been found to have in vitro helicase activity and have been hypothesized to be necessary for unwinding of the double helix and progression of the replication forks (35Masai H. You Z. Arai K. IUBMB Life.. 2005; 57: 323-335Google Scholar, 36Ishimi Y. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 24508-24513Google Scholar, 37Shechter D. Ying C.Y. Gautier J. J. Biol.

Previous reports have shown that CDT1 is not required for keeping the MCM proteins on chromatin once the pre-RCs have been assembled (7Maiorano D. Moreau J. Mechali M. Nature.. 2000; 404: 622-625Google Scholar, 8Nishitani H. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. Nurse P. Nature.. 2000; 404: 625-628Google Scholar, 9Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C.

CDT1 is expressed throughout the cell cycle, but levels fluctuate, due to proteasome degradation, being high in G1, low in S, and high again at the G2-M transition, when it is stabilized by the interaction with Geminin (38Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 44905-44911Google Scholar, 41Ballabeni A. Melixetian M. Zamponi R. Masiero L. Marinoni F. Helin K.

Intriguingly, we have previously noticed that a fraction of CDT1 is stabilized during S phase and protected from proteasome degradation (41Ballabeni A. Melixetian M. Zamponi R. Masiero L. Marinoni F. Helin K. EMBO J.. 2004; 23: 3122-3132Google Scholar). Based on these and other observations we hypothesized that CDT1 has a role beyond pre-RC formation. In agreement with this, we demonstrate here that CDT1 binds to CDC7 and recruits CDC45 to chromatin during S phase. Plasmids, siRNA, and Inhibitors—Human CDT1 was cloned as FLAG-tagged and HA-tagged versions in pcDNA3 and pCMVneoBam vectors, respectively, as previously described (41Ballabeni A. Melixetian M. Zamponi R. Masiero L. Marinoni F. Helin K. EMBO J.. 2004; 23: 3122-3132Google Scholar). For expression in bacteria, CDT1 was cloned in pGEX4T3 and expressed fused to GST. Deletion mutants of CDT1 were constructed by PCR. ΔCy mutant was obtained by mutating arginines 68 and 69 to alanines by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). cDNA for human CDC7 was cloned into blunt-ended BamH1 site of pCMVneoBam as an N-terminal HA-tagged version. D196N and T376A mutants were obtained by changing the nucleotide sequence by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). Human DBF4 was obtained by PCR from a human cDNA library and cloned in the blunt BamHI site of pCMVneo-Bam expression vector as an N-terminal Myc-tagged version. Human CDC45 was cloned in pCMVneoBam expression vector with CDC45 fused at the N terminus to the HA tag. siRNAs were from MWG: the GL2 control and the CDT1 siRNAs have been previously reported (41Ballabeni A. Melixetian M. Zamponi R. Masiero L. Marinoni F. Helin K. EMBO J.. 2004; 23: 3122-3132Google Scholar). The following compounds were used: 2.5 mm thymidine (Sigma), 50 ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma), and 20 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). Antibodies—For CDC7 the DCS-341 antibody (NeoMarkers) was used for immunoblotting analysis, and the monoclonal D10 antibody was produced against full-length protein for immunoprecipitations. A polyclonal antiserum for DBF4 was raised by immunization of a rabbit with a peptide corresponding to residues 357–596. The antibody for CDC45 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-20685). Antibodies for loading controls Lamin B and α-tubulin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-6217) and NeoMarkers (MS-581), respectively. The antibody for MCM7 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-9794). The anti-FLAG antibody was from Sigma (M2). The antibodies for CDT1, cyclin A, MCM2, MCM6, ORC2, vinculin, HA, and Myc were as previously reported (41Ballabeni A. Melixetian M. Zamponi R. Masiero L. Marinoni F. Helin K. EMBO J.. 2004; 23: 3122-3132Google Scholar). Synchronization of Cell Lines—Human U2OS osteosarcoma, HeLa cervix carcinoma, and 293 kidney-transformed cell lines were cultivated, synchronized, and treated at the indicated times as previously described (41Ballabeni A. Melixetian M. Zamponi R. Masiero L. Marinoni F. Helin K. EMBO J.. 2004; 23: 3122-3132Google Scholar). Transfections, Lysates, and Immunoblotting Analysis—Cells were transfected using either Ca3PO4 precipitation method or, alternatively, FuGENE reagent for the experiments of synchronization in S phase. The concentration of DNA for CDC45 was one-third of the concentration of DNA for the other proteins in Fig. 4. Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection, or at the indicated times, with CSK-Triton (CSKT) buffer as previously described (41Ballabeni A. Melixetian M. Zamponi R. Masiero L. Marinoni F. Helin K. EMBO J.. 2004; 23: 3122-3132Google Scholar). The lysates were fractionated in a Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble chromatin-containing fraction. The Triton-insoluble fractions were washed, solubilized with Laemmli buffer, and sonicated before separation by SDS-PAGE for immunoblotting analysis. Total cell lysates were obtained by treating the cell pellets directly with Laemmli buffer and sonication. Immunoblotting analysis was performed by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for chemiluminescence detection. Separation of the proteins by electrophoresis was performed using 10% polyacrylamide gels (unless otherwise specified). Immunoblotting analysis was also performed with fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies for Infrared imaging for quantification of the bands in Fig. 5 (Odyssey Infrared Imaging System, Li-Cor Biosciences).FIGURE 5CDT1 recruits CDC7 complex and CDC45 to chromatin during S phase (U2OS cells). A, U2OS cells were transfected with the plasmids for the indicated proteins. The cells were transfected before synchronization with a double-thymidine block. The cells were then released from the second thymidine block for 1 h and harvested. Half of the cells were used for whole cell extracts, whereas the second half was treated with CSKT buffer for fractionation in triton-“soluble” and triton-“insoluble” chromatin-containing fractions. The “total” (T), soluble (S), and “chromatin” (C) fractions were loaded in parallel for each type of transfection. The Ponceau staining of the nitrocellulose membrane used for the immunoblotting analysis is shown as loading control and to visualize the distribution of the proteome in the three fractions. Lanes relative to chromatin-containing fractions stain weakly due to low levels of the total proteome associated with chromatin. Immunoblotting analysis was performed using the infrared imaging system (Odyssey, Li-Cor, Biosciences) for quantification of the bands. Tubulin and Lamin B are shown as loading controls for the soluble and chromatin-containing fractions, respectively. In the CDC45 blot, the upper band represents the exogenous protein, whereas the bottom band represents the endogenous protein. NT represents non-transfected cells. B, a plot showing the quantification of the bands corresponding to exogenous CDC45 protein in the soluble (S) and chromatin-containing (C) fractions for the four different types of transfections is shown. Arbitrary units have been used for the quantification.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Oligofections were performed following instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen) and by withdrawing serum for 3 or 4 h before re-addition of serum. Oligofections during G1 were performed at 1 h after the release from the mitotic block, followed by 3 h of serum withdrawal. Immunoprecipitations and in Vitro Binding Experiments—To immunoprecipitate CDT1, a monoclonal antibody, P26A6 was used as previously described (41Ballabeni A. Melixetian M. Zamponi R. Masiero L. Marinoni F. Helin K. EMBO J.. 2004; 23: 3122-3132Google Scholar). Sigma anti-FLAG M2 antibody conjugated to agarose gel was used to immunoprecipitate FLAG-tagged CDT1. CDC7 was immunoprecipitated with the D10 monoclonal antibody. For GST binding experiments 1 μg of GST-CDT1 or GST deletion mutants or GST as a control were incubated with 200 μg of total protein extracts from cells overexpressing the indicated proteins and lysed with the following buffer: 50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 m dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors. In Vitro Kinase Assays—For in vitro kinase assays exponentially growing U2OS or HeLa cells, transfected with the indicated plasmids, were lysed with the following buffer: 50 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 1 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors. The lysates were pre-cleared with protein G-Sepharose beads and then used for immunoprecipitations with the anti-CDC7 D10 monoclonal antibody. In vitro kinase reactions were assembled adding 1 μg of Histone H1 (Sigma) as a substrate, 0.1 mm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) and the indicated buffer to reach the final volume of 30 μl. The reactions were conducted at 30 °C for 30 min with moderate shaking and stopped with Laemmli buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. After separation on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transfer to nitrocellulose membrane the phosphorylated proteins were detected by autoradiography. DNA Synthesis—Cells synchronized in mitosis were released into G1, treated with the indicated siRNAs, and blocked at the G1/S transition by 12 h of aphidicolin treatment. After release from aphidicolin, cells were treated at the indicated time with 5 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine (GE Healthcare) for 30 min. The cells were subsequently washed with phosphate-buffered saline, treated with trichloroacetic acid 5%, and washed twice with EtOH. Dried cells were lysed with 1% SDS and 10 mm NaOH for 30 min. The measurement of [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation was performed using a Packard γ-counter for liquid scintillation. Means ± S.D. were calculated. BrdUrd Staining—Cells were treated with 33 μm BrdUrd for 30 min at the indicated times. Cells were then fixed with paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized with Triton 0.1%, stained with mouse anti-BrdUrd primary antibody and Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody, and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence. Nuclei were simultaneously counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The BrdUrd-positive nuclei were counted and plotted. Three independent counts (n = 150 cells each count) were used to calculate means ± S.D. DNA Damage-induced Degradation of CDT1 in G1: Role of CDT1 after Pre-RC Formation?—The past demonstration that the levels of CDT1 are strongly decreased in response to DNA damage after the pre-RCs are formed in G1 (42Higa L.A. Mihaylov I.S. Banks D.P. Zheng J. Zhang H. Nat. Cell Biol... 2003; 5: 1008-1015Google Scholar) led us to hypothesize that CDT1 could have a role during late G1 and in S phase. In agreement with the published results, we also observed a dramatic reduction in CDT1 levels following x-ray and UV treatments (Fig. 1). HeLa cells, pre-synchronized in mitosis, were treated with the indicated doses (10 or 30 Gy) of x-rays at 3 or 6 h after release (Fig. 1A). The cells were then lysed with CSKT buffer at 8 h after mitotic release and Triton-soluble and Triton-insoluble chromatin-containing fractions were obtained. Immunoblotting analysis confirmed that CDT1 is strongly degraded upon DNA damage (Fig. 1B). Interestingly MCM2 and MCM6 proteins were not degraded, either in the soluble or the insoluble fractions (Fig. 1B). FACS analysis showed the cells were synchronized at G1/S transition (Fig. 1C). HeLa cells were then irradiated with UV or x-rays during G1 at 8 h after nocodazole release and harvested 3 h later for immunoblotting analysis. Again, we observed a decrease in total and chromatin-associated CDT1 protein levels. Importantly, total and chromatin-associated MCM2 levels were unchanged (Fig. 1, D and E), suggesting that DNA damage does not affect the already formed pre-RCs. Previously it has been suggested that the degradation of CDT1 upon DNA damage is related to the subsequent decrease of DNA replication (42Higa L.A. Mihaylov I.S. Banks D.P. Zheng J. Zhang H. Nat. Cell Biol... 2003; 5: 1008-1015Google Scholar), and we therefore hypothesized that CDT1 has a role beyond pre-RC formation. In agreement with this, previous results have shown that a small pool of CDT1 is present during S phase and not affected by proteasome activity (41Ballabeni A. Melixetian M. Zamponi R. Masiero L. Marinoni F. Helin K. EMBO J.. 2004; 23: 3122-3132Google Scholar, 46Maiorano D. Rul W. Mechali M. Exp. Cell Res... 2004; 295: 138-149Google Scholar, 47Kulartz M. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 41686-41694Google Scholar). To confirm this, we synchronized HeLa cells with a double thymidine block and released them for 3 h in the middle of S phase. Cells were harvested for immunoblotting and FACS analysis, which showed that all the cells were synchronized in the middle of S phase (data not shown). The immunoblotting analysis of the whole cell extracts confirmed that a small pool of CDT1 was present during S phase (Fig. 1F). In a parallel experiment, we showed that treatment of HeLa cells, released into S phase, with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide decreased the levels of CDT1 (Fig. 1G). As previously shown (38Nishitani H. Taraviras S. Lygerou Z. Nishimoto T. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 44905-44911Google Scholar), CDT1 was also degraded at a high rate during S phase (as inferred by cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132). Based on these results, we conclude that a small pool of CDT1 is maintained during S phase and hypothesize that CDT1 is involved in pre-IC formation in S phase. CDT1 Associates with the CDC7-DBF4 Complex in Vitro—To understand if human CDT1 has a role in pre-IC formation during S phase we first tested if CDT1 can interact with the CDC7-DBF4 complex (for brevity CDC7 complex), whose activity is required for pre-IC assembly and S phase progression. CDT1 has previously been shown to interact with the Cyclin A/CDK2 complex during S phase (48Liu E. Li X. Yan F. Zhao Q. Wu X. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 17283-17288Google Scholar, 49Sugimoto N. Tatsumi Y. Tsurumi T. Matsukage A. Kiyono T. Nishitani H. Fujita M. J. Biol. Chem... 2004; 279: 19691-19697Google Scholar). Because CDT1 interacts with the regulatory subunit of that complex, we tested if recombinant GST-CDT1 fusion protein could interact with DBF4. As shown in Fig. 2A, CDT1 can bind to DBF4 only when co-expressed with CDC7, suggesting that CDT1 binds to the catalytic subunit of the CDC7-DBF4 complex. We therefore tested if CDT1 can bind to CDC7 alone. To test this we also used two different catalytic inactive mutants of CDC7. One (D196N) mutated in an aspartic acid residue (of the putative ATP hydrolysis site) required for kinase activity (Fig. 2, B and C), and the other (T376A) mutated in the threonine residue of the putative activation loop (50Masai H. Matsui E. You Z. Ishimi Y. Tamai K. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem... 2000; 275: 29042-29052Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2D, CDT1 can bind to CDC7 in the absence of ectopically expressed DBF4 (Fig. 2D). However, interestingly, the binding of CDC7 to CDT1 was increased in cells co-expressing CDC7 and DBF4 suggesting that the regulatory subunit increases the affinity of the enzymatic subunit for CDT1. Alternatively, CDT1 might bind with higher affinity to activated CDC7. Both mutants were able to bind to CDT1 either alone or in combination with DBF4 similarly to wild type (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the increase in affinity observed upon DBF4 overexpression is not due to CDC7 kinase activity per se. We also mapped the region of CDT1 involved in the binding to CDC7. As demonstrated in Fig. 2E, N-terminal-deleted CDT1 mutants did not bind to CDC7. Moreover, we confirmed the binding by gel filtration of CDT1 and CDC7 complex purified from baculovirus-infected cells. When expressed with the CDC7 complex, CDT1 eluted earlier and in the same fractions as CDC7 and DBF4 indicating that CDT1, CDC7, and DBF4 proteins are part of the same complex (supplemental Fig. S1). Taken together, we conclude that the CDC7-DBF4 complex can bind to the N terminus of CDT1 through its catalytic subunit. This N terminus of CDT1, which is conserved in multicellular eukaryotes (9Wohlschlegel J.A. Dwyer B.T. Dhar S.K. Cvetic C. Walter J.C. Dutta A.

J. Biol. Chem... 2006; 281: 6246-6252Google Scholar) (Fig. 2F). CDT1 Associates with the CDC7-DBF4 Complex in Vivo—To test if CDT1 and CDC7 could interact in vivo, we overexpressed CDT1 in 293 cells with either the CDC7 complex or the D196N complex and immunoprecipitated CDT1 using a CDT1-specific monoclonal antibody. In our experimental conditions CDT1 overexpression did not lead to re-replication, which is in agreement with the notion that the onset of re-replication is dependent on the cell type and the expression levels (34Lutzmann M. Maiorano D. Mechali M. EMBO J.. 2006; 25: 5764-5774Google Scholar, 57Saxena S. Dutta A. Mutat. Res... 2005; 569: 111-121Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, CDT1 binds both wild-type and kinase-inactive mutants of CDC7. Moreover, CDT1 can also associate with endogenous CDC7 (Fig. 3B). Because CDC7 and CDK complexes bind to the same region of CDT1, we tested if a mutant of CDT1 unable to bind CDK (ΔCyCDT1) was impaired in binding to the CDC7 complex. To do this, we expressed CDT1 and ΔCyCDT1 mutant in 293 cells together with wt CDC7 or the D196N mutant complex. We observed that CDC7 was able to interact (even though slightly less efficiently) with ΔCy mutant (Fig. 3C). Moreover, we also noticed that DBF4 was less phosphorylated when CDC7 was co-expressed with ΔCy mutant (Fig. 3C). CDT1 Promotes CDC45 Recruitment to Chromatin in Vivo (HeLa Cells)—The recruitment of the CDC7 complex to chromatin is a prerequisite for pre-IC formation and DNA replication. To test if CDT1 is required for the recruitment of CDC7 to chromatin and involved in pre-IC formation during S phase, we expressed the pre-IC component CDC45 at low levels (see “Experimental Procedures”) together with CDT1 either alone or in combination with CDC7 and DBF4 (Fig. 4, A and B). The transfected cells were then synchronized at the G1/S transition with a double thymidine block. Lysates were prepared 1 h after release from the second thymidine block and analyzed by immunoblotting for the levels of CDC45 protein associated with the chromatin. Because we were also concerned about the stability and levels of the other proteins during S phase progression (see “Results” and “Discussion” below) we treated the cells with protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide at the time of the first harvesting (i.e. 1 h after the release from the second thymidine block) and then prepared lysates at intervals of 3 h. Strikingly both the expression of CDT1 and the CDC7 complex resulted in increasing levels of CDC45 on chromatin, whereas the levels in the soluble fraction were only mildly affected (Fig. 4, A and B, correspond to the soluble and chromatin-containing fractions, respectively). The co-expression of CDT1 with the CDC7 complex led to a further increase of the levels of CDC45 on chromatin, suggesting that both components are limiting for the recruitment of CDC45 to chromatin. The expression of D196N mutant complex led to results similar to those obtained"

However, the molecular mechanism by which IL-3 regulates 24p3 expression remains largely unknown. Here, we show that 24p3 is a direct target of Foxo3a and that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt mediates IL-3-repressed 24p3 through regulation of Foxo3a. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt (but not MAPK) pathway induced 24p3 expression and programmed cell death in FL5.12 cells. Furthermore, constitutively active Akt largely attenuated 24p3 expression and apoptosis in response to IL-3 withdrawal. Foxo3a directly bound to the 24p3 promoter and induced promoter activity. Akt abrogated wild-type Foxo3a-induced (but not Akt-non-phosphorylatable Foxo3a3A-induced) 24p3 expression and promoter activity. Therefore, these data indicate for the first time that 24p3 is a Foxo3a target gene and that PI3K/Akt (but not MAPK) mediates IL-3-regulated 24p3 expression in hematopoietic cells.

Apoptosis is a genetically controlled cell suicide program that has been implicated in diverse biological processes such as the development and homeostasis of multicellular organisms and the defense mechanism against pathogens (1Raff M.C.

Apoptosis in hematopoietic cells can be induced by withdrawal of cytokines such as interleukin-3 (IL-3) 2The abbreviations used are: IL-3, interleukin-3; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; Myr-Akt, myristoylated Akt. 2The abbreviations used are: IL-3, interleukin-3; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; Myr-Akt, myristoylated Akt. (4Ishida Y. Agata Y. Shibahara K. Honjo T. EMBO J.. 1992; 11: 3887-3895Google Scholar). IL-3 exerts its survival and proliferative functions through a common signaling subunit, the βc receptor. Signal transduction events that regulate survival by IL-3 are mediated in part by cytosolic tyrosine kinases (5Kinoshita T. Yokota T. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J.. 1995; 14: 266-275Google Scholar). In the absence of IL-3, IL-3-dependent progenitor cells undergo apoptosis (6McCubrey J. Holland G. McKearn J. Risser R. Oncogene Res.. 1989; 4: 97-109Google Scholar, 7Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nuñez G. Thompson C.B. Cell.. 1993; 74: 597-608Google Scholar). Another signaling molecule that is activated by IL-3 is phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) (8Gold M.R. Duronio V. Saxena S.P. Schrader J.W. Aebersold R. J. Biol. Chem.. 1994; 269: 5403-5412Google Scholar, 9Scheid M.P. Lauener R.W. Duronio V. Biochem. J.. 1995; 312: 159-162Google Scholar). PI3K has been implicated in the regulation of survival in various cell types (10Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell.. 1995; 81: 727-736Google Scholar). Akt is a downstream target of PI3K and is able to support the survival of a number of cell types after survival factor deprivation (3Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev.. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Google Scholar, 11Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E.

A previous study also examined the ability of activated forms of Akt to protect cells from death induced by withdrawal of IL-2 in BAF/3 cells (13Ahmed N.N. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.. 1997; 94: 3627-3632Google Scholar). Akt activity is induced rapidly by IL-3, and the activation of Akt by IL-3 depends upon the activity of PI3K. Previous studies demonstrated that Akt protects IL-3-dependent FL5.12 cells from IL-3 depletion-induced apoptosis through phosphorylation of BAD (14del Peso L. González-García M. Page C. Herrera R. Nuñez G. Science.. 1997; 278: 687-689Google Scholar, 15Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell.. 1997; 91: 231-241Google Scholar). Pro-apoptotic protein 24p3 has been shown to be significantly elevated at the mRNA and protein levels in FL5.12 cells after IL-3 withdrawal, which was demonstrated to be essential for IL-3 deprivation-induced apoptosis (16Devireddy L.R. Teodoro J.G. Richard F.A. Green M.R. Science.. 2001; 293: 829-834Google Scholar). The conditioned medium from IL-3-deprived cells, which contains secreted 24p3, induces apoptosis in naïve cells, even when IL-3 is present. 24p3 also induces apoptosis in a wide variety of leukocytes, indicating that IL-3 deprivation enhances 24p3 transcription and leads to synthesis and secretion of 24p3, which induces apoptosis in an autocrine manner (16Devireddy L.R. Teodoro J.G. Richard F.A. Green M.R. Science.. 2001; 293: 829-834Google Scholar). In addition to murine FL5.12 pro-B cells, many other cell types are susceptible to 24p3-mediated apoptosis, including murine primary thymocytes, murine primary splenocytes, murine primary bone marrow cells, human primary neutrophils, and human peripheral blood lymphocytes. In contrast, human primary macrophages, HeLa cells, and Jurkat cells are not susceptible to 24p3-mediated apoptosis (16Devireddy L.R. Teodoro J.G. Richard F.A. Green M.R. Science.. 2001; 293: 829-834Google Scholar). In addition, the 24p3 receptor was recently identified in FL5.12 cells and found to bind to iron-bound and iron-free forms of 24p3 (17Devireddy L.R. Gazin C. Zhu X. Green M.R. Cell.. 2005; 123: 1293-1305Google Scholar). However, their effects on cell survival are different. Iron-bound 24p3 increases intracellular iron concentration without promoting apoptosis; iron-free 24p3 decreases intracellular iron levels, which induces expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim, resulting in apoptosis. Recent studies also showed that the BCR-ABL oncoprotein activates expression of 24p3 but inhibits 24p3 receptor transcription in BCR-ABL-positive cells. Secreted 24p3 leads neighboring cells to apoptosis (17Devireddy L.R. Gazin C. Zhu X. Green M.R. Cell.. 2005; 123: 1293-1305Google Scholar, 18Lin H. Monaco G. Sun T. Ling X. Stephens C. Xie S. Belmont J. Arlinghaus R. Oncogene.. 2005; 24: 3246-3256Google Scholar). By inhibiting BCR-ABL, imatinib/Gleevec inhibits 24p3 transcription and induces 24p3 receptor expression. As a result, BCR-ABL-positive chronic myeloid leukemia cells undergo programmed cell death (17Devireddy L.R. Gazin C. Zhu X. Green M.R. Cell.. 2005; 123: 1293-1305Google Scholar, 18Lin H. Monaco G. Sun T. Ling X. Stephens C. Xie S. Belmont J. Arlinghaus R. Oncogene.. 2005; 24: 3246-3256Google Scholar). Members of the forkhead transcription factor family play a pro-apoptotic role in neurons or hematopoietic cells. Akt antagonizes FOXO pro-apoptotic function through phosphorylation of serine/threonine residues, leading to FOXO translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (19Greer E.L. Brunet A. Oncogene.. 2005; 24: 7410-7425Google Scholar, 20Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell.. 1999; 96: 867-868Google Scholar). In this work, we show that Foxo3a, a major member of the FOXO family, directly binds to the 24p3 promoter and induces 24p3 transcription in response to IL-3 withdrawal. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt (but not MAPK) pathway antagonizes IL-3 down-regulation of 24p3. Activation of Akt inhibits 24p3 expression and apoptosis induced by IL-3 deprivation in FL5.12 cells through phosphorylation of Foxo3a. Cell Culture, Reagents, and Transfection—IL-3-dependent FL5.12 murine pro-B cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% WEHI-3B-conditioned medium (a source of IL-3) (21Cory A.H. Owen T.C. Barltrop J.A. Cory J.G. Cancer Commun.. 1991; 3: 207-212Google Scholar). PD98059, wortmannin, and LY294002 were obtained from Calbiochem. Human recombinant insulin-like growth factor-1 was purchased from Invitrogen. Transfection of FL5.12 cells was carried out by electroporation. Cells were electroporated at 1 × 106 cells/400 μl at 275 V and 960 microfarads with 25 μg of plasmid DNA. Stable clonal cell lines were established after selection with G418 (600 μg/ml). Plasmids—The human 24p3 gene was amplified by nested PCR using a human myeloid leukemia cDNA library (Stratagene). The primers used were 5-1 (5′-AGCAGCCACCACAGCGCCTG-3′), 5-2, (5′-CCGGAATTCGGATCCATGCCCCTAGGTCTCCTGTG-3′), 3-1 (5′-TCAATGGTGTTCGGGCTGGTG-3′), and 3-2 (5′-TGCTCTAGACTCGAGGCCGTCGATACACTGGTCGATTG-3′). Amplified DNA products were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.5-GW-FLAG and the glutathione S-transferase-fused vector pGEX-4T-1. For cloning the human 24p3 promoter, a 1.3-kb DNA fragment upstream transcription start site was amplified from human genomic DNA using nested PCR and primers 5-1 (5′-AAGACAGAATATCGCTCTGTTCCAGGC-3′), 5-2 (TTCAGATCTCCAGGCTAAAGTGCAAAGGGG-3′), 3-1 (5′-CTGCTGGGCCTGGCAGGGGTGGAAG-3′), and 3-2 (5′-CCCAAGCTTAGGAGGTGGCGAGTGAGAGG-3′). Amplified DNA fragments were subcloned into the pGL3-Luc reporter vector (Promega). The integrity of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Hemagglutinin-Foxo3a and FLAG-Foxo3a3A were kindly provided by Dr. B. M. T. Burgering, and Akt plasmids were described previously (22Sun M. Yang L. Feldman R.I. Sun X. Jove R. Nicosia S.V. Cheng J.Q. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 42992-43000Google Scholar). Luciferase Reporter Assay—FL5.12 or HEK293 cells were cultured in 12-well plates and transiently transfected with pGL3-24p3-Luc, Foxo3a, and/or Akt as well as with pCMV-β-gal. The amount of DNA in each transfection was kept constant by the addition of empty vector. After incubation for 36 h, luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay reagent (Promega). The β-galactosidase activity was measured with Galacto-Light (Tropix). Transfection efficiency was normalized by pCMV-β-gal. Luciferase activity was expressed as relative luciferase activity. Northern and Western Blot Analyses—Northern blot analysis was performed according to standard procedure. Briefly, total RNA was electrophoresed on 1.0% formaldehyde-agarose gels, transferred to Duralon-UV™ membrane (Stratagene), and then hybridized with 32P-labeled 24p3 cDNA probe. Membrane was exposed to x-ray film, and the mRNA levels were visualized and quantified using PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Western blotting was performed as described previously (22Sun M. Yang L. Feldman R.I. Sun X. Jove R. Nicosia S.V. Cheng J.Q. J. Biol. Chem.. 2003; 278: 42992-43000Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with the appropriate antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. Cell Viability—Cell viability was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium dye reduction assay measuring mitochondrial respiratory function (23Wells J. Boyd K.E. Fry C.J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol.. 2000; 20: 5797-5807Google Scholar). FL5.12 cells were plated in 96-well plates (104 cells/well) and treated with conditioned media and inhibitors as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were incubated with 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium dye (20 μl/well) for 2 h and solubilized with 10% SDS (25 μl/well) at room temperature for 4 h. Absorbance was determined in a Titertek plate reader at 490 nm. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed essentially as described previously (24Tran H. Brunet A. Grenier M.J. Datta S.R. Fornace Jr., A.J. DiStefano P.S. Chiang L.W. Greenberg M.E. Science.. 2002; 296: 530-534Google Scholar). Briefly, solubilized chromatin was prepared from a total of 2 × 107 asynchronously growing FL5.12 cells that were electroporated with hemagglutinin-Foxo3a. The chromatin solution was diluted 10-fold with chromatin immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.01% SDS, and protease inhibitors) and precleared with protein A beads. The precleared chromatin solution was utilized for immunoprecipitation assay with either anti-Foxo3a (Upstate) or anti-actin antibody. Following washing, the antibody-protein-DNA complex was eluted from the beads by resuspending the pellets in 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3 at room temperature for 20 min. After a reverse cross-link, protein and RNA were removed by incubation with 10 μg of proteinase K and 10 μg of RNase A at 42 °C for 3 h. Purified DNA was subjected to PCR with primers specific for three putative Foxo3a-binding sites in the 24p3 promoter. The PCR primers used were as follows: region 1, 5′-CAGGAGCAGCAAACAGGTAAATCAATGGCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CATCCCTCTGTCCCTGGCCATAACCTTG-3′ (reverse); region 2, 5′-TACCTTTGAAAGCAGCCACAAGGGCGTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AACAGACCCTGTGCAGCTTCCTTGTCTGG-3′ (reverse); and region 3, 5′-TTGCTCAACCTTGCACAGTTCCGACCTGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGCCATGGTTTCCACAGCTACATGGTCTG-3′ (reverse). Amplified PCR products were resolved on 1.2% agarose gel and visualized by BioImage. DNA Fragmentation and Caspase Activity—Approximately 2 μg of DNA from cells treated with different reagents was separated on 1.5% agarose gel and visualized. Caspase activity was measured with the Caspase-Glo® 3/7 assay system (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. PI3K/Akt (but Not MAPK) Pathway Inhibits 24p3 Expression Induced by IL-3 Deprivation and Mediates IL-3 Survival Signal in FL5.12 Cells—Previous studies have demonstrated that IL-3 activates Akt, which results in the phosphorylation of BAD and cell survival in IL-3-dependent FL5.12 cells. Deprivation of IL-3 reduces BAD phosphorylation, leading to programmed cell death (14del Peso L. González-García M. Page C. Herrera R. Nuñez G. Science.. 1997; 278: 687-689Google Scholar, 15Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell.. 1997; 91: 231-241Google Scholar). Transcriptional induction of 24p3 has been shown, however, to play a pivotal role in induction of apoptosis in response to IL-3 withdrawal (16Devireddy L.R. Teodoro J.G. Richard F.A. Green M.R. Science.. 2001; 293: 829-834Google Scholar). To determine whether the PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in the regulation of 24p3 by IL-3, FL5.12 cells were cultured in IL-3-free medium for 12 h and then switched into medium containing IL-3, PI3K inhibitor LY294002, or MEK inhibitor PD98059. Immunoblot analysis revealed that, upon IL-3 withdrawal, 24p3 was increased by ∼3-fold. The addition of IL-3 to the medium significantly reduced 24p3 expression. However, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway with either LY294002 or dominant-negative Akt largely abrogated IL-3-reduced 24p3, whereas the MEK inhibitor PD98059 had no effect on 24p3 expression. Furthermore, stable expression of constitutively active Akt inhibited 24p3 levels induced by IL-3 deprivation (Fig. 1A). We further examined the role of the PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways in IL-3-dependent cell survival. FL5.12 cells were treated with or without LY294002 or PD98059 in the presence and absence of IL-3. As shown in Fig. 1 (B and C), inhibition of PI3K induced greater cell death compared with blockage of the MAPK pathway. Moreover, ectopic expression of constitutively active Akt inhibited cell death induced by IL-3 deprivation (Fig. 1, D and E), whereas expression of dominant-negative Akt largely abrogated IL-3-protected apoptosis (Fig. 1D). However, neither constitutively active nor dominant-negative Akt had a significant effect on FL5.12 cell proliferation (data not shown). These data indicate that the PI3K/Akt pathway mediates primarily IL-3 action in 24p3 expression and cell survival. PI3K/Akt Reduces 24p3 mRNA Expression—Having observed the PI3K/Akt pathway to mediate IL-3-regulated 24p3 protein expression, we next investigated whether PI3K/Akt regulates 24p3 at the transcriptional level. Following culture of FL5.12 cells in the absence and presence of IL-3 and treatment with LY294002 or PD98059, Northern blot analysis showed that the mRNA level of 24p3 was elevated upon IL-3 withdrawal. The addition of IL-3 repressed 24p3 mRNA expression. Inhibition of PI3K (but not MEK) reduced the effect of IL-3 on 24p3 mRNA expression (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, expression of constitutively active Akt inhibited IL-3 withdrawal-induced 24p3, whereas dominant-negative Akt partially abrogated IL-3-repressed 24p3 mRNA expression (Fig. 2, A and B). Isolation of the Human 24p3 Promoter and IL-3 Inhibition of 24p3 Promoter Activity through the PI3K/Akt Pathway—To further analyze the transcriptional regulation of 24p3 by Akt, we defined the transcription start site using 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends and cloned the 1.3-kb DNA upstream transcription start site of the human 24p3 gene (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. 1). Sequence analysis revealed three putative binding sites (TTGTTTAC) for Foxo3a (-1178/-1163, -903/-892, and -69/-52), two (i.e. -1178/-1163 and -903/-892) of which are conserved in mouse, as well as one for NF-κB, CREB (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein), and C/EBP (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein) in the 24p3 promoter (Fig. 3B). To investigate whether the promoter is regulated by IL-3, FL5.12 cells were transfected with pGL3-24p3-Luc and β-galactosidase and cultured in medium supplemented with and without IL-3. Fig. 3C shows that the 24p3 promoter activity was induced by ∼22-fold upon IL-3 withdrawal, whereas the addition of IL-3 significantly reduced the promoter activity. Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K (but not MAPK) largely abrogated IL-3-repressed 24p3 promoter activity. In addition, 24p3 promoter activity induced by IL-3 deprivation was decreased by expression of constitutively active Akt in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3D). These findings suggest that IL-3 controls 24p3 transcription by regulation of transcriptional factor(s) through a PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway. Foxo3a Mediates IL-3 Signals to Regulate the 24p3 Promoter—Previous studies have shown that expression of the Foxo3a transcription factor induces cell death and cell growth arrest through transactivation of a number of genes such as bim, fasL, and gadd45 (20Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell.. 1999; 96: 867-868Google Scholar, 24Tran H. Brunet A. Grenier M.J. Datta S.R. Fornace Jr., A.J. DiStefano P.S. Chiang L.W. Greenberg M.E. Science.. 2002; 296: 530-534Google Scholar, 25Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Curr. Biol.. 2000; 10: 1201-1204Google Scholar). Because the 24p3 promoter contains three putative Foxo3a-binding sites and because Foxo3a is a major target of Akt (20Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell.. 1999; 96: 867-868Google Scholar), we investigated whether the 24p3 promoter is regulated by Foxo3a. HEK293 cells were transfected with pGL3-24p3-Luc, β-galactosidase, and increasing amounts of Foxo3a. Fig. 4A shows that 24p3 promoter activity was induced by Foxo3a in a dose-dependent manner. Coexpression of constitutively active Akt repressed the promoter activity induced by Foxo3a but not by Foxo3aA3, a mutant form that cannot be phosphorylated by Akt (Fig. 4B). Moreover, Foxo3a-induced 24p3 promoter activity was largely inhibited by IL-3 treatment in FL5.12 cells. In contrast, IL-3 treatment had no effect on Foxo3aA3-induced 24p3 promoter activity (Fig. 4C). To further demonstrate that IL-3 regulates 24p3 through the Akt/Foxo3a axis, we examined the phosphorylation level of Foxo3a and 24p3 expression in response to IL-3 treatment. FL5.12 cells were transfected with constitutively active Akt [myristoylated Akt (Myr-Akt)] or pcDNA3 vector and then treated with and without IL-3. Immunoblot analysis showed that IL-3 deprivation reduced the phosphorylation levels of Foxo3a and Akt and increased 24p3 expression in pcDNA3-transfected cells (Fig. 5A, second lane) but not in Myr-Akt-transfected cells (fourth lane). Furthermore, expression of Akt-non-phosphorylatable Foxo3aA3 abrogated IL-3-inhibited 24p3 expression at the protein (Fig. 5B) and mRNA (Fig. 5C) levels. In addition, knockdown of Foxo3a largely attenuated 24p3 levels induced by IL-3 withdrawal (Fig. 5D). In contrast, inhibition of Akt by either Akt inhibitor API-2 or Akt short hairpin RNA induced 24p3 expression (Fig. 5, E and F). Taken collectively, these data indicate that 24p3 is a direct downstream target of Foxo3a and that Foxo3a-regulated 24p3 is controlled by the IL-3/Akt pathway. Defining the Foxo3a Response Element(s) in the 24p3 Promoter—The 24p3 promoter contains three putative Foxo3a-binding sites, and thus, we next defined which binding site(s) is required for the promoter to respond to Foxo3a. A series of deletion mutants of the 24p3 promoter were created and used for the luciferase reporter assay. As shown in Fig. 6A, the deletion mutant promoter (P3) created by removal of region -340/+18 was considerably induced by Foxo3a, whereas the mutant promoters (P4 and P5) with a deletion of the region(s) containing the third and/or the second Foxo3a-binding sites largely reduced the ability to respond to Foxo3a, suggesting that major Foxo3a response elements in the promoter are located in the last two Foxo3a-binding sites and that a repression element(s) may reside in the region between bp -304 and +18. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that Foxo3a bound to the second and third sites in vivo (Fig. 6B). In addition, luciferase reporter assay using point mutation of each Foxo3a-binding site demonstrated that the last two binding sites are indeed required for the 24p3 promoter to respond to Foxo3a (Fig. 6C). Conditioned Medium from Myr-Akt-FL5.12 Cells Fails to Induce Apoptosis, and Myr-Akt-FL5.12 Cells Resist Apoptosis Induced by Conditioned Medium Expressing 24p3—Previous studies have shown that conditioned medium from IL-3-deprived FL5.12 cells expresses 24p3 and induces apoptosis in a number of hematopoietic cell lines (16Devireddy L.R. Teodoro J.G. Richard F.A. Green M.R. Science.. 2001; 293: 829-834Google Scholar). Because Akt/Foxo3a mediates IL-3-regulated 24p3 expression, we further examined the cell viability of naïve FL5.12 cells following treatment with different conditioned media. As shown in Fig. 7A, the conditioned media from pcDNA3-transfected and parental FL5.12 cells induced naïve FL5.12 cell death, whereas the conditioned medium from constitutively active Akt-transfected FL5.12 cells contained very low levels of 24p3 and had no significant effect on cell viability. In contrast, all conditioned media failed to induce cell death in constitutively active Akt-transfected FL5.12 cells (Fig. 7B). These results further support our findings that 24p3 is regulated by IL-3 through the PI3K/Akt/FOXO pathway and that activation of Akt not only inhibits 24p3 expression induced by IL-3 deprivation but also reduces 24p3-induced cell death (Fig. 7C). Previous studies have shown that Akt mediates the IL-3 cell survival signal in hematopoietic cells through phosphorylation of BAD, which leads to the switching of BAD from the Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL complex into 14-3-3 and the loss of its pro-apoptotic function (14del Peso L. González-García M. Page C. Herrera R. Nuñez G. Science.. 1997; 278: 687-689Google Scholar). 24p3 has recently been identified as a key molecule for IL-3 withdrawal-induced apoptosis in IL-3-dependent cells (16Devireddy L.R. Teodoro J.G. Richard F.A. Green M.R. Science.. 2001; 293: 829-834Google Scholar). Neutralization of 24p3 using anti-24p3 antibody largely reduces cell death induced by IL-3 deprivation (16Devireddy L.R. Teodoro J.G. Richard F.A. Green M.R. Science.. 2001; 293: 829-834Google Scholar). 24p3 is transcriptionally regulated by IL-3 signaling, i.e. withdrawal of IL-3 induces and addition of IL-3 represses 24p3 expression at both the protein and mRNA levels. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is unknown. We have demonstrated in this study that IL-3 regulation of 24p3 is mediated by the Akt/Foxo3a axis. Transcription factor Foxo3a directly binds to and transactivates the 24p3 promoter. The regulation of 24p3 by Foxo3a is controlled by IL-3 through the PI3K/Akt (but not MAPK) pathway. IL-3 activates Akt, which leads to phosphorylation and inhibition of Foxo3a function for 24p3. IL-3 deprivation results in dephosphorylation and activation of Foxo3a and increases the expression of 24p3. Moreover, expression of constitutively active Akt inhibits FL5.12 cell death after deprivation of IL-3, which is due to suppression of 24p3 transcription through phosphorylation of Foxo3a. FOXO transcription factors are crucial regulators of cell fate. It has been shown that FOXO transcription factors control cell survival by regulation of its downstream target genes. The common FOXO target genes that are involved in apoptosis include BNIP3 and bim (24Tran H. Brunet A. Grenier M.J. Datta S.R. Fornace Jr., A.J. DiStefano P.S. Chiang L.W. Greenberg M.E. Science.. 2002; 296: 530-534Google Scholar, 25Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Curr. Biol.. 2000; 10: 1201-1204Google Scholar). In addition to direct targets, FOXO also indirectly down-regulates the expression of pro-survival Bcl-xL by inducing the expression of transcriptional repressor Bcl-6 (26Tang T.T. Dowbenko D. Jackson A. Toney L. Lewin D.A. Dent A.L. Lasky L.A. J. Biol. Chem.. 2002; 277: 14255-14265Google Scholar). In neurons, Foxo3a triggers cell death circuitously by inducing the expression of Fas ligand, which activates programmed cell death through the death receptor pathway (20Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell.. 1999; 96: 867-868Google Scholar). In hematopoietic cells, we have shown in this study that 24p3 is a direct target of Foxo3a and provokes cell death after IL-3 deprivation in naïve FL5.12 cells. Foxo3a up-regulates 24p3 transcription through directly binding to the 24p3 promoter. In addition, a previous study demonstrated that 24p3 induces apoptosis in FL5.12 cells even in culture medium containing IL-3 (16Devireddy L.R. Teodoro J.G. Richard F.A. Green M.R. Science.. 2001; 293: 829-834Google Scholar). However, our data show that constitutively active Akt-transfected FL5.12 cells resist apoptosis induced by conditioned medium expressing 24p3 (Fig. 7A). Because IL-3 induces Akt activation, it is difficult to understand how constitutively active Akt can override 24p3-induced cell death. A possible mechanism is that constitutively active Akt might regulate the 24p3 receptor cascade and other pro-apoptotic molecules prior to 24p3 treatment. Further investigations into the underlying mechanism are required. In summary, we have demonstrated that Foxo3a directly regulates 24p3 expression and mediates IL-3 signaling in hematopoietic cells. Deprivation of IL-3 decreases Akt phosphorylation of Foxo3a, which leads to the induction of 24p3 transcription and cell death. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt (but not MAPK) increases 24p3 expression, whereas activation of Akt reduces 24p3 and inhibits 24p3-induced apoptosis. These findings indicate that 24p3 is a direct target of Foxo3a and that the PI3K/Akt (but not MAPK) pathway mediates IL-3 function in 24p3 in hematopoietic cells.

https://openalex.org/W2049974415,"Among the primary goals of microarray analysis is the identification of genes that could distinguish between different phenotypes (feature selection). Previous studies indicate that incorporating prior information of the genes' function could help identify physiologically relevant features. However, current methods that incorporate prior functional information do not provide a relative estimate of the effect of different genes on the biological processes of interest.Here, we present a method that integrates gene ontology (GO) information and expression data using Bayesian regression mixture models to perform unsupervised clustering of the samples and identify physiologically relevant discriminating features. As a model application, the method was applied to identify the genes that play a role in the cytotoxic responses of human hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2) to saturated fatty acid (SFA) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, as compared to the non-toxic response to the unsaturated FFAs (UFA) and TNF-alpha. Incorporation of prior knowledge led to a better discrimination of the toxic phenotypes from the others. The model identified roles of lysosomal ATPases and adenylate cyclase (AC9) in the toxicity of palmitate. To validate the role of AC in palmitate-treated cells, we measured the intracellular levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP). The cAMP levels were found to be significantly reduced by palmitate treatment and not by the other FFAs, in accordance with the model selection of AC9.A framework is presented that incorporates prior ontology information, which helped to (a) perform unsupervised clustering of the phenotypes, and (b) identify the genes relevant to each cluster of phenotypes. We demonstrate the proposed framework by applying it to identify physiologically-relevant feature genes that conferred differential toxicity to saturated vs. unsaturated FFAs. The framework can be applied to other problems to efficiently integrate ontology information and expression data in order to identify feature genes."

The ecological equilibrium in the nasopharynx can be disrupted by the presence of antibiotics.A computerized two-compartment pharmacodynamic model was used to explore beta-lactam effects on the evolution over time of a bacterial load containing common pharyngeal isolates by simulating free serum concentrations obtained with amoxicillin (AMX) 875 mg tid, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC) 875/125 mg tid and cefditoren (CDN) 400 mg bid regimens over 24 h. Strains and MICs (microg/ml) of AMX, AMC and CDN were: S. pyogenes (0.03, 0.03 and 0.015), S. pneumoniae (2, 2 and 0.25), a beta-lactamase positive H. influenzae (BL(+); >16, 2 and 0.06) and a beta-lactamase positive AMC-resistant H. influenzae (BLPACR, >16, 8 and 0.06). Mixture of identical 1:1:1:1 volumes of each bacterial suspension were prepared yielding an inocula of approximately 4 x 10(6) cfu/ml. Antibiotic concentrations were measured both in bacterial and in bacteria-free antibiotic simulations. beta-lactamase production decreased AMX concentrations and fT(>MIC) against S. pneumoniae (from 43.2% to 17.7%) or S. pyogenes (from 99.9% to 24.9%), and eradication was precluded. The presence of clavulanic acid countered this effect of co-pathogenicity, and S. pyogenes (but not BL(+) and S. pneumoniae) was eradicated. Resistance of CDN to TEM beta-lactamase avoided this co-pathogenicity effect, and CDN eradicated S. pyogenes and H. influenzae strains (fT(>MIC) >58%), and reduced in 94% S. pneumoniae counts (fT(>MIC) approximately 25%).Co-pathogenicity seems to be gradual since clavulanic acid countered this effect for strains very susceptible to AMX as S. pyogenes but not for strains with AMX MIC values in the limit of susceptibility as S. pneumoniae. There is a potential therapeutic advantage for beta-lactamase resistant cephalosporins with high activity against streptococci."

PTEN dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate and thus is a potent negative regulator of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway. Although PTEN was initially discovered as a tumor suppressor, more recent in vivo studies have highlighted its role in metabolism.

Importantly, despite the loss of this tumor suppressor, there was no evidence of tumor formation in β cells. c-Myc is a proto-oncogene, and its expression is often elevated and deregulated in a wide range of human cancers. c-Myc is a potent inducer of both cell proliferation and apoptosis and appears to sensitize cells to apoptotic triggers (10Klefstrom J. Verschuren E.W. Evan G.I. J. Biol. Chem... 2002; 277: 43224-43232Google Scholar). Importantly, the effects of c-Myc appear to be highly tissue-specific. Overexpression of c-Myc in β cells using the rat insulin promoter in mice leads to accelerated proliferation, which is rapidly overcome by apoptosis, leading to severe diabetes and death shortly after birth (11Laybutt D.R. Weir G.C. Kaneto H. Lebet J. Palmiter R.D. Sharma A. Bonner-Weir S. Diabetes.. 2002; 51: 1793-1804Google Scholar). Investigating the role of c-Myc in adult β cells, however, has been made possible by the use of a modified estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain fused to the human c-myc gene, which has allowed for a molecular “switch” to turn on or off c-Myc activity in tissues of interest (12Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res... 1995; 23: 1686-1690Google Scholar). Using this transgenic model, Pelengaris et al. (13Pelengaris S. Khan M. Evan G.I. Cell.. 2002; 109: 321-334Google Scholar) revealed that when apoptosis is suppressed in β cells using overexpression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL, the oncogenic potential of c-Myc is manifested, with development of islet tumors and dedifferentiation of β cells as early as 7 days after c-Myc activation and evidence of metastases upon prolonged c-Myc induction. Given the emerging interest in PTEN as a potential therapeutic target for diabetes, we were interested in studying the potential tumorigenic effect of the loss of PTEN in β cells with concomitant c-Myc activation. Mouse Protocol—RIPcre+Pten+/fl mice, expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the rat insulin promoter, were generated as described previously (9Nguyen K.T. Tajmir P. Lin C.H. Liadis N. Zhu X.D. Eweida M. Tolasa-Karaman G. Cai F. Wang R. Kitamura T. Belsham D.D. Wheeler M.B. Suzuki A. Mak T.W. Woo M. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2006; 26: 4511-4518Google Scholar). Myc-ER(TAM) (Myc+) transgenic mice were generated as described previously (13Pelengaris S. Khan M. Evan G.I. Cell.. 2002; 109: 321-334Google Scholar). Myc+ mice were bred to RIPcre+Pten+/fl mice to generate Myc+RIPcre+Pten+/fl mice, and these mice were intercrossed to generate Myc+RIPcre+Pten+/+, Myc+RIPcre+Ptenfl/fl, and Myc+RIPcre+Pten+/fl mice. A small number of Myc- mice were also produced using this breeding strategy. Control mice for all experiments were Myc+RIPcre+Pten+/fl or Myc+-RIPcre+Pten+/+ littermates. Both male and female mice were used for experiments as there were no sex-related differences. Mice were maintained on a mixed background. The activity of the mice was not restricted, and they were maintained on a 12-h light/dark schedule. All mice were fed regular chow (Harlan Laboratories). All protocols were approved by the Ontario Cancer Institute, Animal Care Committee. Activation of c-Myc and Blood Glucose Measurements—The Myc-ER(TAM) transgene was activated by daily intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg of tamoxifen (Sigma) suspended in peanut oil (Sigma) at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml in adult mice (age 2–10 months). Tamoxifen was injected in all experimental mice between 8 and 10 a.m. daily for 1, 6, and 20 days. Blood glucose was measured by an automated glucose monitor (One Touch Ultra; Lifescan Inc., Milpitas, CA) prior to each injection. Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescent Staining—Pancreata were isolated from mice at day 0, day 1, day 6, and day 20 after tamoxifen injection. Pancreatic tissue was fixed for 24 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), and sections were immunostained for PTEN (Neomarker), insulin (DAKO), glucagon (Sigma), hematoxylin and eosin (not shown), synaptophysin (Roche Applied Science), laminin (Sigma), β-catenin (BD Biosciences), Ki67 (DAKO), and TUNEL (ID Labs Biotechnology Inc.). Immunofluorescent-stained sections were visualized using a Zeiss inverted fluorescent microscope. Western Blotting—Islets from mice at day 1 of tamoxifen injection as well as from non-injected littermates were isolated, and protein lysates were obtained as described previously (7Wijesekara N. Konrad D. Eweida M. Jefferies C. Liadis N. Giacca A. Crackover M. Suzuki A. Mak T.W. Kahn C.R. Klip A. Woo M. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2005; 25: 1135-1145Google Scholar). Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies for c-Myc (9E10, gift of L. Penn), Akt, phospho-Akt-(Ser-473), Bad, phospho-Bad(Ser-136), phospho-Bad(Ser-112), phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (phospho-ERK), ERK, p53 (Cell Signaling), amylin (Bachem), p27, and Bcl-xL (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Western blot signal densities were analyzed using Image J software. Protein levels were normalized to α-tubulin levels and expressed in arbitrary units relative to littermate control levels. Semiquantitatve Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—mRNA was extracted from isolated islets by TRIzol following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) and treated with ribonuclease-free deoxyribonuclease (Invitrogen). RT-PCR amplifications of endogenous mouse c-Myc and β-actin transcripts were performed with a one-step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). Primer sequences are available upon request. Densitometric analysis was performed using Image J software. To correct for differences in loading, we corrected densitometric values of c-Myc cDNA with corresponding values of β-actin cDNA and calculated the c-Myc:β-actin ratios. Statistical Analysis—Data are presented as means ± S.E and were analyzed by one-sample t test and independent samples t test. Significant differences were determined using the statistical software SPSS (version 11.0 for Macintosh). p values of < 0.05 were accepted as statistically significant. PTEN Deletion in Islets Leads to Increased Islet Mass—Immunohistochemistry for PTEN protein in paraffin-embedded pancreata confirmed deletion of PTEN in islets of Myc+-RIPcre+Ptenfl/fl mice versus control littermates (Fig. 1A). As we and others have previously shown (8Stiles B.L. Kuralwalla-Martinez C. Guo W. Gregorian C. Wang Y. Tian J. Magnuson M.A. Wu H. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2006; 26: 2772-2781Google Scholar, 9Nguyen K.T. Tajmir P. Lin C.H. Liadis N. Zhu X.D. Eweida M. Tolasa-Karaman G. Cai F. Wang R. Kitamura T. Belsham D.D. Wheeler M.B. Suzuki A. Mak T.W. Woo M. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2006; 26: 4511-4518Google Scholar), the loss of PTEN in β cells led to increased islet mass when examined under basal conditions without tamoxifen injection (Fig. 1B). Additionally, consistent with its role as a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway, the loss of PTEN led to increased phospho-Akt and diminished expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 as well as increased expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-xL (Fig. 1, A and C). These results indicate that when the c-Myc transgene is not active, the Myc+RIPcre+Ptenfl/fl mice are similar with respect to islet phenotype as compared with RIPcre+Ptenfl/fl mice without the Myc-ER(TAM) transgene. The observed differences between p27 and Bcl-xL expression in the Myc+RIPcre+Ptenfl/fl and control mice without c-Myc activation are abolished after 1 day of c-Myc induction (Fig. 1C). However, there is a persistent increase in phospho-Akt expression in the Myc+RIPcre+Ptenfl/fl mice as compared with controls even after 1 day of tamoxifen treatment. Furthermore, c-MycER protein expression levels were similar in control and Myc+RIPcre+Ptenfl/fl mice injected for 1 day with tamoxifen, suggesting that the c-Myc transgene was activated to a similar degree in these animals (Fig. 1D). Endogenous mouse c-Myc mRNA transcript levels were similarly low between the islets of Myc+RIPcre+Ptenfl/fl mice as compared with control mice in the absence of c-Myc activation (Fig. 1E). These results are consistent with the low levels of c-Myc expression that have been observed in association with the low rates of proliferation that occur in β cells under basal conditions (14Jonas J.C. Sharma A. Hasenkamp W. Ilkova H. Patane G. Laybutt R. Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 14112-14121Google Scholar, 15Bonner-Weir S. Weir G.C. Nat. Biotechnol... 2005; 23: 857-861Google Scholar). After 1 day of tamoxifen injection, levels of endogenous c-Myc in islets were again similarly low between Myc+RIPcre+Pten+/+ and Myc+RIPcre+Ptenfl/fl mice. These results indicate that endogenous c-Myc does do not play a significant role in our transgenic model of c-Myc-activation and that there were no differences between PTEN-deficient and wild-type islets (Fig. 1E). PTEN Koss in c-Myc-activated β Cells Does Not Provide Protection against Diabetes—Mice were injected daily for 20 days with tamoxifen to persistently activate the c-Myc transgene as described previously (13Pelengaris S. Khan M. Evan G.I. Cell.. 2002; 109: 321-334Google Scholar). Both Myc+RIPcre+Ptenfl/fl mice and control littermates became hyperglycemic within 4 days of c-Myc activation (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, consistent with the rise in blood glucose, prolonged c-Myc activation led to complete β cell ablation in Myc+RIPcre+Ptenfl/fl mice and control littermates (Fig. 2B). Given that Myc- mice do not have the c-Myc transgene, as expected, they did not have any change in blood glucose levels after daily tamoxifen injection (Fig. 2A), and pancreatic islets remained unaffected (Fig. 2B). Thus, with c-Myc activation in β cells by tamoxifen, the concomitant loss of PTEN in β cells does not confer protection from islet involution and diabetes development. Loss of PTEN Does Not Affect c-Myc-induced Proliferation and Apoptosis—Because the pancreata of Myc+RIPcre+Ptenfl/fl mice have enlarged islet area prior to c-Myc activation, we next examined the pancreatic area of Myc+RIPcre+Ptenfl/fl mice after c-Myc activation. After 1 day of tamoxifen injection, the Myc+RIPcre+Ptenfl/fl mice still had evidence of a greater islet area (Fig. 3A). Activation of c-Myc in β cells has been shown to lead to an early increase in proliferation (13Pelengaris S. Khan M. Evan G.I. Cell.. 2002; 109: 321-334Google Scholar). Indeed, at day 1 after tamoxifen injection, there was rapid appearance of increased proliferation of β cells, as evidenced by markedly increased Ki67-positive staining (Fig. 3B). This increase in proliferation was similar between Myc+RIPcre+Ptenfl/fl and Myc+-RIPcre+Pten+/+ control mice with tamoxifen treatment (Fig. 3B). As c-Myc in β cells has been shown to have dual roles in both proliferation and apoptosis, we also examined for apoptosis by TUNEL of pancreata. As suggested by the rise in blood glucose observed with 20 days of tamoxifen injection, there was increased TUNEL after 1 day of c-Myc activation to a similar degree in Myc+RIPcre+Ptenfl/fl and Myc+-RIPcre+Pten+/+ islets as compared with non-injected mice (Fig. 3C). These results indicate that with the loss of PTEN in β cells and concomitant c-Myc activation, the β cells do undergo early proliferation. However, the loss of PTEN in β cells is not able to override the predominant apoptotic signal conferred by sustained c-Myc activation in β cells. c-Myc Activation and PTEN Loss Does Not Lead to Tumor Formation—We have previously shown that the loss of PTEN alone in β cells does not lead to tumorigenesis (9Nguyen K.T. Tajmir P. Lin C.H. Liadis N. Zhu X.D. Eweida M. Tolasa-Karaman G. Cai F. Wang R. Kitamura T. Belsham D.D. Wheeler M.B. Suzuki A. Mak T.W. Woo M. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2006; 26: 4511-4518Google Scholar). However, c-Myc is known to be a potent oncogene, and its multiple oncogenic attributes are revealed if apoptosis is suppressed in β cells (13Pelengaris S. Khan M. Evan G.I. Cell.. 2002; 109: 321-334Google Scholar). Thus, we were interested to know whether both the loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN and the activation of the oncogene c-Myc in β cells would lead to islet tumorigenesis. With the early proliferation seen after 1 day of tamoxifen injection, there was no evidence of disrupted islet architecture as evidenced by preserved β and α cell localization within the islet (Fig. 4A, upper panel). However, after 6 days of sustained c-Myc activation, there was an increase in α cells, as is often observed after β cell destruction (16Li Z. Karlsson F.A. Sandler S. J. Endocrinol... 2000; 165: 93-99Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A, lower panel). β-Catenin is usually localized to the plasma membrane in quiescent cells as part of cell adhesion complexes. However, in rapidly proliferating cells such as tumors, β-catenin is liberated from the cell membrane and migrates to the nucleus, where it acts as a transcription factor and mediates cell proliferation (17Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1990; 87: 4246-4250Google Scholar). In the Myc+RIPcre+Ptenfl/fl and Myc+RIPcre+Pten+/+ islets, β-catenin was localized at the cell membrane after 1 day as well as sustained activation of c-Myc, suggesting that cell-cell adhesion was intact (Fig. 4B). Additionally, in both Myc+-RIPcre+Ptenfl/fl and Myc+-RIPcre+Pten+/+ islets, laminin expression demonstrated intact basement membrane structures (Fig. 4C). Moreover, examination of synaptophysin-stained pancreatic sections (Fig. 2B) did not reveal the presence of tumors upon prolonged (20-day) c-Myc activation. These data taken together indicate that concomitant loss of a potent tumor suppressor, PTEN, and the activation of a potent oncogene, c-Myc, in β cells do not lead to tumor formation. c-Myc Induction Leads to Bad Dephosphorylation and Increased MAPK Signaling Activity—In an attempt to clarify which components of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway were involved in c-Myc-induced apoptosis, we examined the phosphorylation levels of the downstream proapoptotic molecule Bad. The inactivation of Bad requires phosphorylation at two distinct sites, serines 112 and 136, which are phosphorylated by the epidermal growth factor receptor/mitogen extracellular kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (EGFR/MEK/MAPK) and PI3K/Akt pathways respectively (18Gajewski T.F. Thompson C.B. Cell.. 1996; 87: 589-592Google Scholar, 19Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell.. 1996; 87: 619-628Google Scholar). Prior to c-Myc activation, Bad is phosphorylated at both serine 112 and serine 136. However, upon c-Myc activation, we observed decreased levels of Bad phosphorylation of both serine residues in Myc+RIPcre+Ptenfl/fl mice relative to control, suggesting that c-Myc apoptosis at least in part is Bad-dependent (Fig. 5). The MAPK pathway regulates the activity of several transcription factors, including p53, which modulates the cell cycle and apoptosis and hence functions as a tumor suppressor (20Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer.. 2002; 2: 594-604Google Scholar). MAPK activity, as shown by phosphorylation of ERK, is increased, as is p53 expression upon c-Myc activation in islets of both Myc+RIPcre+Ptenfl/fl and Myc+RIPcre+Pten+/+ mice. These results would suggest that perhaps PTEN-deficient β cells may undergo apoptosis using these pathways that are not differentially protected as a consequence of PTEN deletion. Together, we have shown that when PTEN is deleted and c-Myc is activated in β cells, islet disruption and rapid diabetes development ensue due to apoptosis directed by c-Myc activation, which still proceeds despite the loss of PTEN. Importantly, the lack of tumor development suggests that even in the context of oncogenic activation, the loss of PTEN is insufficient to promote tumor formation in β cells. The use of tissue-targeted ablation has shown that PTEN has diverse tissue- and context-specific roles. In the pancreatic β cell, PTEN plays a role in β cell size and islet mass (8Stiles B.L.

Importantly, the loss of PTEN in β cells does not lead to tumorigenesis, and differentiated β cell function is preserved (9Nguyen K.T. Tajmir P. Lin C.H. Liadis N. Zhu X.D. Eweida M. Tolasa-Karaman G. Cai F. Wang R. Kitamura T. Belsham D.D. Wheeler M.B. Suzuki A. Mak T.W. Woo M. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2006; 26: 4511-4518Google Scholar). In addition, within the β cell, the loss of PTEN has been shown to confer protection from β cell apoptosis and diabetes induced by multiple low doses of streptozotocin (8Stiles B.L. Kuralwalla-Martinez C. Guo W. Gregorian C. Wang Y. Tian J. Magnuson M.A. Wu H. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2006; 26: 2772-2781Google Scholar, 9Nguyen K.T. Tajmir P. Lin C.H. Liadis N. Zhu X.D. Eweida M.

Biol... 2006; 26: 4511-4518Google Scholar). c-Myc is a potent oncogene that has a predominantly proapoptotic role in β cells. However, when coupled with Bcl-xL overexpression, c-Myc activation leads to β cell tumorigenesis (13Pelengaris S. Khan M. Evan G.I. Cell.. 2002; 109: 321-334Google Scholar). Given that PTEN is a tumor suppressor, we were interested in examining the effect of the loss of PTEN in β cells with concomitant c-Myc activation. We found that surprisingly, apoptosis due to c-Myc activation still occurred despite the loss of PTEN. Additionally, there was no evidence of islet tumor development in these double mutant mice. Our results suggest that the c-Myc-induced apoptotic signal can overcome the potent prosurvival signal conferred by the loss of PTEN. The role of PTEN in apoptosis is mediated through the PI3K/Akt pathway via regulation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 like factors (such as Bcl-2, Bcl-xL) and proapoptotic factors (such as Bad, Bax, Bak). Akt inhibits caspases, which cleave Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (21Kennedy S.G. Wagner A.J. Conzen S.D. Jordan J. Bellacosa A. Tsichlis P.N. Hay N. Genes Dev... 1997; 11: 701-713Google Scholar) and which are involved in the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Bcl-xL resides in the outer mitochondrial membrane, and increased activation of this protein leads to decreased permeabilization of the membrane, blockage of cytochrome c release, and thus, a decrease in apoptosis. Because the loss of PTEN increases signaling through the PI3K pathway, PTEN deletion would be expected to increase Bcl-xL levels and lead to protection from apoptosis. Indeed, we have shown that Bcl-xL expression is increased in PTEN-deficient mice under basal conditions. The Bcl-xL overexpression results by Pelengaris et al. (13Pelengaris S. Khan M. Evan G.I. Cell.. 2002; 109: 321-334Google Scholar) implied that c-Myc-induced apoptosis in β cells is also mediated by the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (13Pelengaris S. Khan M. Evan G.I. Cell.. 2002; 109: 321-334Google Scholar). This makes our results in which we fail to observe tumor development upon c-Myc activation in PTEN-deficient mice all the more surprising given the evidence supporting the role of both PTEN and c-Myc in the same pathway of apoptosis. Our model reveals that physiological prosurvival signals that are unveiled as a consequence of PTEN deletion are clearly different from those at work in the overexpression model of Bcl-xL. Through its negative regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, PTEN also influences the function of proapoptotic proteins such as Bad. Phosphorylation at either of its serine residues is sufficient to bind Bad to 14-3-3, which sequesters it from its effector molecules, thereby preventing it from exercising its proapoptotic function (22Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell.. 1997; 91: 961-971Google Scholar). In PTEN-deficient tumor cells, Bad has been implicated as the key molecule responsible for integrating the pathways that suppress apoptosis (23She Q.-B. Solit D.B. Ye Q. O'Reilly K.E. Lobo J. Rosen N. Cancer Cell.. 2005; 8: 287-297Google Scholar). We, however, have shown decreased levels of Bad phosphorylation in PTEN-deficient islets upon c-Myc activation. This finding suggests that the prosurvival signal conferred by PTEN deletion appears to be insufficient to counteract c-Myc-induced apoptosis. As well, it suggests that c-Myc is exerting its proapoptotic effect, at least in part, by influencing molecules that are involved in Bad phosphorylation. In addition, the activation of the c-Myc transgene in the Myc+RIPcre+Ptenfl/fl and Myc+RIPcre+Pten+/+ mice is associated with increased MAPK activity and p53 expression in islets of both groups. These results are in keeping with a previous study that p53 mediates apoptosis as a safeguard mechanism to prevent cell proliferation induced by c-Myc activation (24Hermeking H. Eick D. Science.. 1994; 265: 2091-2093Google Scholar), which may further explain the increased apoptosis and the lack of tumorigenesis in these islets. Accumulating evidence supporting favorable metabolic changes upon PTEN inhibition has led to PTEN as an attractive drug target against type 2 diabetes mellitus (25Lazar D.F. Saltiel A.R. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov.. 2006; 5: 333-342Google Scholar). Due to the broad tissue distribution of PTEN as well as its role in attenuating numerous PI3K-dependent processes, this approach may pose significant safety risks. However, advances in tissue selectivity for gene targeting may make it possible to inhibit PTEN function specifically in the β cells of diabetic individuals. Not only does the loss of PTEN in β cells not lead to tumorigenesis, but even with a concomitant induction of an oncogene, a situation that should create an environment that is favorable for tumor formation, we observed no tumorigenesis. Thus, in β cells, PTEN deletion seems to maintain and perhaps enhance β cell function without impacting on tumorigenesis, which raises hopes that selective inhibition of PTEN activity may be a promising therapeutic approach to type 2 diabetes."
