A potential disadvantage of this process is that some of the antibodies produced are self-reactive. We determined the prevalence of self-reactive antibody formation and its regulation in human B cells. A majority (55 to 75%) of all antibodies expressed by early immature B cells displayed self-reactivity, including polyreactive and anti-nuclear specificities. Most of these autoantibodies were removed from the population at two discrete checkpoints during B cell development. Inefficient checkpoint regulation would lead to substantial increases in circulating autoantibodies."

We compiled records, extending back thousands of years, of the status and trends of seven major guilds of carnivores, herbivores, and architectural species from 14 regions. Large animals declined before small animals and architectural species, and Atlantic reefs declined before reefs in the Red Sea and Australia, but the trajectories of decline were markedly similar worldwide. All reefs were substantially degraded long before outbreaks of coral disease and bleaching. Regardless of these new threats, reefs will not survive without immediate protection from human exploitation over large spatial scales."

Five amino acids have been incorporated into proteins efficiently and with high fidelity in response to the nonsense codon TAG. The side chains of these amino acids contain a keto group, which can be uniquely modified in vitro and in vivo with a wide range of chemical probes and reagents; a heavy atom–containing amino acid for structural studies; and photocrosslinkers for cellular studies of protein interactions. This methodology not only removes the constraints imposed by the genetic code on our ability to manipulate protein structure and function in yeast, it provides a gateway to the systematic expansion of the genetic codes of multicellular eukaryotes."

Traditionally, this deposition is thought to reinforce the cell wall and is regarded as a defense response. Surprisingly, here we found that powdery mildew resistant 4 (pmr4), a mutant lacking pathogen-induced callose, became resistant to pathogens, rather than more susceptible. This resistance was due to mutation of a callose synthase, resulting in a loss of the induced callose response. Double-mutant analysis indicated that blocking the salicylic acid (SA) defense signaling pathway was sufficient to restore susceptibility to pmr4 mutants. Thus, callose or callose synthase negatively regulates the SA pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2002820714,"Identification of general properties of evolutionary radiations has been hindered by the lack of a general statistical and phylogenetic approach applicable across diverse taxa. We present a comparative analytical framework for examining phylogenetic patterns of diversification and morphological disparity with data from four iguanian-lizard taxa that exhibit substantially different patterns of evolution. Taxa whose diversification occurred disproportionately early in their evolutionary history partition more of their morphological disparity among, rather than within, subclades. This inverse relationship between timing of diversification and morphological disparity within subclades may be a general feature that transcends the historically contingent properties of different evolutionary radiations."

Vitamin K2 supplementation up-regulates the expression of bone markers, increases bone density in vivo, and is used clinically in the management of osteoporosis. The mechanism of vitamin K2 action in bone formation was thought to involve its normal role as an essential cofactor for γ-carboxylation of bone matrix proteins. However, there is evidence that suggests vitamin K2 also has a transcriptional regulatory function. Vitamin K2 bound to and activated the orphan nuclear receptor SXR and induced expression of the SXR target gene, CYP3A4, identifying it as a bona fide SXR ligand. Vitamin K2 treatment of osteosarcoma cells increased mRNA levels for the osteoblast markers bone alkaline phosphatase, osteoprotegerin, osteopontin, and matrix Gla protein. The known SXR activators rifampicin and hyperforin induced this panel of bone markers to an extent similar to vitamin K2. Vitamin K2 was able to induce bone markers in primary osteocytes isolated from wild-type murine calvaria but not in cells isolated from mice deficient in the SXR ortholog PXR. We infer that vitamin K2 is a transcriptional regulator of bone-specific genes that acts through SXR to favor the expression of osteoblastic markers. Thus, SXR has a novel role as a mediator of bone homeostasis in addition to its role as a xenobiotic sensor. An important implication of this work is that a subset of SXR activators may function as effective therapeutic agents for the management of osteoporosis.

Osteoporosis is a common disease affecting the elderly, particularly postmenopausal women, although a significant minority of older men is also affected. It is defined as the gradual reduction in bone strength with advancing age that is manifested by such observations as bone fracture following minimal trauma (1Orwoll E.S. Bauer D.C. Vogt T.M.

Vitamin K2 is a family of naphthoquinones, the most biologically important of which is menatetrenone (for a review, see Ref. 21Shearer M.J. Lancet. 1995; 345: 229-234Abstract PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Vitamin K2 was discovered as a critical nutrient required for blood clotting. It acts as a cofactor for the microsomal γ-carboxylase that facilitates the post-translational conversion of glutamic acid to γ-carboxyglutamyl (Gla) residues (for a review, see Ref. 14Weber P. Int. J. Vitam. Nutr. Res. 1997; 67: 350-356PubMed Google Scholar). Post-translational conversion of 9–12 Glu to Gla residues is required for the function of proteins such as prothrombin and Factors VII, IX, and X in the blood clotting cascade (for reviews, see Refs. 21Shearer M.J.

These studies indicate that SXR functions as a xenobiotic sensor to coordinately regulate drug clearance in the liver and intestine. Indeed gene knockout studies have confirmed a role for SXR in regulating the metabolism of endogenous steroids and dietary and xenobiotic compounds (29Staudinger J.L. Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Hawkins-Brown D. MacKenzie K.I. LaTour A. Liu Y. Klaassen C.D. Brown K.K. Reinhard J. Willson T.M. Koller B.H. Kliewer S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 2000; 406: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). During our original screening experiments that led to the discovery of SXR as a steroid and xenobiotic sensor, we noted that vitamin K2 could also activate SXR. 2B. Blumberg, unpublished observations. This observation led us to consider the possibility that vitamin K2 might act as a bona fide SXR ligand to mediate biological processes other than xenobiotic metabolism and clearance. Since vitamin K2 was previously suspected to have a transcriptional regulatory function in addition to its role as an enzyme cofactor (37Koshihara Y. Hoshi K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that SXR might be the mediator of this activity. In this report, we demonstrate that vitamin K2 transcriptionally activates SXR in a dose-dependent manner and binds directly to SXR in vitro and in vivo. SXR mRNA is expressed in osteosarcoma cell lines, and vitamin K2 induced the expression of the prototypical SXR target gene CYP3A4 in these cells. Vitamin K2 up-regulates the steady state mRNA levels for a panel of osteoblastic bone markers in the osteosarcoma cell lines HOS, MG-63, and Saos-2, demonstrating a mechanistic connection between vitamin K2 and bone development. The known SXR activators rifampicin and hyperforin induce the same panel of bone markers as does vitamin K2, further confirming a role for SXR in the regulation of these genes. Finally we found that vitamin K2 was able to induce bone markers in primary osteocytes isolated from wild-type murine calvaria but not in cells isolated from PXR knockout mice. From these data, we conclude that vitamin K2 modulates the expression of osteoblastic bone markers through SXR and infer that vitamin K2 activation of SXR could be an important factor favoring the deposition of bone over its resorption. Therefore, SXR is likely to be involved in the maintenance of bone homeostasis in addition to its known role in hormonal homeostasis. This reveals a novel biological function for SXR and suggests that a subset of SXR activators may function as effective therapeutic agents for the management of osteoporosis. SXR Detection by RT-PCR—HOS, MG-63, Saos-2, LS180, and HeLa cells were cultured in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% resin charcoal-stripped FBS. Total RNA was isolated using TriZol reagent (Invitrogen). For RT-PCR analysis, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer-supplied protocol (Invitrogen). SXR was detected with the following primer set: forward primer, 5′-CAAGCGGAAGAAAAGTGAACG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CTGGTCCTCGATGGGCAAGT-3′. PCR was carried out at 37 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s. Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells were cultured and transfected as described previously (38Grun F.

Typically COS-7 cells were cultured in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. For transient transfection experiments, COS-7 cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 5000 cells/well. The next day cells were transfected with either CMX-GAL-SXR or CMX-GAL4 (control) together with tk(MH100)4-luc reporter (39Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) and CMX-β-galactosidase transfection control plasmids using standard calcium phosphate precipitation methodology. 22–24 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1 mm MgCl2 or DMEM-ITLB (DMEM containing 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml holotransferrin, 5 μg/ml selenium, 0.5% defined lipid mix (Invitrogen), 0.12% (w/v) delipidated bovine serum albumin (Sigma)) (40Buck J. Grun F. Derguini F. Chen Y. Kimura S. Noy N. Hammerling U. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Ligands were typically purchased from Sigma and BIOMOL Research Laboratories Inc., made freshly from powder in Me2SO as 0.1 m stocks, diluted in Me2SO to appropriate concentrations, and added to media with vigorous vortex mixing. Ligands were added in DMEM-ITLB, and the cells were incubated for an additional 24–48 h. The cells were lysed in situ, and extracts were prepared and assayed for β-galactosidase and luciferase activity as described previously (41Blumberg B. Sabbagh W. Juguilon H. Bolado Jr., J. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3195-3205Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). Reporter gene activity was normalized to the β-galactosidase transfection controls, and the results were expressed as normalized relative luciferase units per OD β-galactosidase per minute to facilitate comparisons between plates. Fold induction was calculated relative to solvent controls. Each data point represents the average of triplicates ± S.E. The experiments were repeated three times with similar results. For coactivator recruitment experiments, GAL4-coactivator plasmids were generated by cloning the receptor interaction domains of human TIF2 (GenBank™ accession number NM_006540, amino acids 563–790), human SRC-1 (GenBank™ accession number U59302, amino acids 600–800), or human ACTR (GenBank™ accession number AF036892, amino acids 600–788) into pCMX-GAL4. The GAL4-PBP construct was described previously (30Synold T.W. Dussault I. Forman B.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar).

Incubation was continued for 3 h at room temperature. Total counts were measured using a Topcount scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Counts remaining after the addition of 10 μm clotrimazole were taken as nonspecific background and subtracted from all wells (33Jones S.A. Moore L.B. Shenk J.L. Wisely G.B. Hamilton G.A. McKee D.D.

Briefly, cells were harvested by washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, then collected with a cell scraper, and transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Cell pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C, and lysates were prepared with a solution containing 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and 1 mm MgCl2. Aliquots of lysate were combined with reaction buffer (1 m diethanolamine, pH 9.8, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Absorbance at 405 nm was measured using a Spectra MAX Plus spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences), and the enzyme activity was calculated as described previously (6Akedo Y. Hosoi T. Inoue S.

ALP activity was corrected for protein content, which was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR Analysis of Bone Biomarker Genes in Osteosarcoma Cell Lines—Human osteosarcoma cell lines HOS, MG-63, and Saos-2 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in phenol red-free DMEM supplemented with 10% resin charcoal-stripped FBS. Cells were treated with vitamin K2, 1α,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3, rifampicin, or solvent controls for 48 h. Total RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed as described above. Quantitative real time RT-PCR (QRT-PCR) was performed using the following primer sets: ALP (F, 5′-CATGGCTTTGGGCAGAAGGA-3′; R, 5′-CTAGCCCCAAAAAGAGTTGCAA-3′), osteopontin (OPN) (F, 5′-CAGACGAGGACATCACCTCA-3′; R, 5′-TGGCTGTGGGTTTCAGCA-3′), matrix Gla protein (MGP) (F, 5′-ATCGCTACTTCAGGAAGCGCC-3′; R, 5′-TGACTCTCCTTTGACCCTGACCCTCAC-3′), osteoprotegerin (OPG) (F, 5′-CCTCTCATCAGCTGTTGTGTG-3′; R, 5′-TATCTCAAGGTAGCGCCCTTC-3′), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (F, 5′-TGGACCTCATGGCCCACA-3′; R, 5′-TCAAGGGGTCTACATGGCAA-3′), CYP3A4 (F, 5′-GGCTTCATCCAATGGACTGCATAAAT-3′; R, 5′-TCCCAAGTATAACACTCTACACAGACAA-3′), and the SYBR green PCR kit (Applied Biosystems) in a DNA Engine Opticon-Continuous Fluorescence Detection system (MJ Research). All samples were quantitated by the comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method for relative quantitation of gene expression, normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (43Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). Isolation of Calvaria, Culture of Primary Bone Cells, and QRT-PCR—Calvaria were isolated from newborn wild-type and PXR knockout mice (postnatal day 1–5) and were digested sequentially with 0.1% collagenase, 0.05% trypsin, 4 mm EDTA in 1× phosphate-buffered saline essentially as described in Refs. 44Wong G.L.

Bone cells released upon digestion were cultured in phenol-red free DMEM, 10% FBS and treated for 48 h with 10 μm vitamin K2 or pregnenolone 16α-carbonitrile (PCN). Total RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, and analyzed using the following mouse primer sets: MGP (F, 5′-TCTCACGAAAGCATGGAGTC-3′; R, 5′-ATCTCGTAGGCAGGCTTGTT-3′), OPG (F, 5′-CTGCTGAAGCTGTGGAAACA-3′; R, 5′-AAGCTGCTCTGTGGTGAGGT-3′), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (F, 5′-AACTTTGGCATTGTGGAAGG-3′; R, 5′-GGATGCAGGGATGATGTTCT-3′). Statistical Analysis—Differences between two groups were analyzed using two-sample, two-tailed Student's t test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered to be significant. All data are presented in the text and figures as the mean ± S.E. SXR Is Expressed in Osteosarcoma Cell Lines—SXR functions as a xenobiotic sensor and is expressed at high levels in the liver and intestine where it modulates the levels of CYP enzymes and ATP-binding cassette family transporters (31Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 46Xie W. Evans R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37739-37742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). SXR is expressed at lower levels in normal and neoplastic breast tissues (47Dotzlaw H. Leygue E. Watson P. Murphy L.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 2103-2107PubMed Google Scholar) and breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-435) (47Dotzlaw H. Leygue E. Watson P. Murphy L.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 2103-2107PubMed Google Scholar). 3M. M. Tabb and B. Blumberg, unpublished data. It is not clear at present what role SXR is playing in other tissues. We were intrigued by the ability of vitamin K2 to activate SXR in preliminary experiments. To ascertain whether SXR might be mediating the effects of vitamin K2, we first determined whether SXR was expressed in a panel of osteosarcoma cell lines using RT-PCR. SXR expression was observed in the LS180 human colon adenocarcinoma cells and in the osteosarcoma cell lines HOS, MG-63, and Saos-2. SXR mRNA was not detected in HeLa cells or in negative controls (Fig. 1). It has been previously reported that SXR is expressed in LS180 cells (28Dussault I. Lin M. Hollister K. Wang E.H. Synold T.W. Forman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33309-33312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 30Synold T.W. Dussault I. Forman B.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), whereas it is not expressed in HeLa cells (48Masuyama H. Inoshita H. Hiramatsu Y. Kudo T. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). SXR is expressed at highest levels in LS180 cells with lower levels in the osteosarcoma cell lines (Fig. 1). Vitamin K2 Activates SXR—SXR is activated by a diverse array of pharmaceutical agents including Taxol, rifampicin, SR12813, clotrimazole, phenobarbital, and hyperforin. As noted above, our early screening efforts aimed at identifying SXR ligands also demonstrated SXR activation by vitamin K2. Accordingly we tested the ability of vitamin K2 to activate SXR in dose-response experiments. As shown in Fig. 2A, vitamin K2 activates CMX-GAL-SXR robustly with the highest levels of activation approximately equivalent to 1 μm rifampicin (RIF). In contrast, no activation was observed using CMX-GAL4 alone, demonstrating that the activation results from a specific interaction with the SXR ligand binding domain. Next we tested the ability of vitamin K2 to induce the SXR target gene CYP3A4 in cultured osteosarcoma cells. It has been reported previously that CYP3A4 expression is induced by RIF and vitamin D3 in cultured HepG2 and LS180 cells (49Schmiedlin-Ren P. Thummel K.E. Fisher J.M. Paine M.F. Watkins P.B. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2001; 29: 1446-1453PubMed Google Scholar, 50Sumida A. Fukuen S. Yamamoto I. Matsuda H. Naohara M. Azuma J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 756-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), although the 1α,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 induction of CYP3A4 is mediated by the vitamin D3 receptor rather than by SXR (51Makishima M. Lu T.T. Xie W. Whitfield G.K. Domoto H. Evans R.M. Haussler M.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2002; 296: 1313-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). RIF induced the expression of CYP3A4 in all three lines (Fig. 2B). Vitamin K2 was able to induce CYP3A4 expression at both 1 and 10 μm in all three lines. 1α,25-(OH)2 vitamin D3 could not induce CYP3A4 expression in Saos-2 or HOS cells (Fig. 2B). Vitamin K2 Specifically Binds to SXR in Vitro and in Vivo— Since vitamin K2 activates SXR in transient transfections (Fig. 2A) and induces the expression of a prototypical SXR target gene in osteosarcoma cells (Fig. 2B), we next sought to determine whether vitamin K2 binds to SXR. One important measure of ligand binding is the ability of a compound to induce a nuclear receptor to interact with coactivator proteins. Accordingly we conducted coactivator recruitment experiments that utilized VP16-SXR together with fusions between the GAL4 DNA binding domain and the receptor-interacting domains of the nuclear hormone receptor coactivators SRC-1, TIF2, ACTR, and PBP (30Synold T.W. Dussault I. Forman B.M. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, VP16-SXR was able to interact with PBP, SRC-1, and ACTR in the presence of vitamin K2 or the known SXR ligand RIF. The results from the coactivator recruitment experiments paralleled those of the activation assays. As is the case for other SXR ligands (30Synold"

Deletion of both FXR and PXR in vivo by cross-breeding B6;129-Fxrtm1Gonz (FXR-null) and B6;129-Pxrtm1Glaxo-Wellcome (PXR-null) mice revealed a more severe disruption of bile acid, cholesterol, and lipid homeostasis in B6;129-Fxrtm1Gonz Pxrtm1Glaxo-Wellcome (FXR-PXR double null or FPXR-null) mice fed a 1% cholic acid (CA) diet. Hepatic expression of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and its target genes was induced in FXR- and FPXR-null mice fed the CA diet. To test whether up-regulation of CAR represents a means of protection against bile acid toxicity to compensate for the loss of FXR and PXR, animals were pretreated with CAR activators, phenobarbital or 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichlorpyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP), followed by the CA diet. A role for CAR in protection against bile acid toxicity was confirmed by a marked reduction of serum bile acid and bilirubin concentrations, with an elevation of the expression of the hepatic genes involved in bile acid and/or bilirubin metabolism and excretion (CYP2B, CYP3A, MRP2, MRP3, UGT1A, and glutathione S-transferase α), following pretreatment with phenobarbital or TCPOBOP. In summary, the current study demonstrates a critical and combined role of FXR and PXR in maintaining not only bile acid but also cholesterol and lipid homeostasis in vivo. Furthermore, FXR, PXR, and CAR protect against hepatic bile acid toxicity in a complementary manner, suggesting that they serve as redundant but distinct layers of defense to prevent overt hepatic damage by bile acids during cholestasis.

Furthermore, FXR, PXR, and CAR protect against hepatic bile acid toxicity in a complementary manner, suggesting that they serve as redundant but distinct layers of defense to prevent overt hepatic damage by bile acids during cholestasis. Bile acids, the amphipathic end products of cholesterol metabolism, are critical for the absorption of dietary fats and fat-soluble vitamins, as well as regulation of bile flow and biliary lipid secretion that facilitate the excretion of conjugated drugs and endogenous waste products. Bile acid production also represents a major route for the elimination of excess cholesterol (1Hofmann A.F. Ital. J. Gastroenterol. 1995; 27: 106-113PubMed Google Scholar). Because disturbances of bile acid biosynthesis, metabolism, or transport cause diseases in the liver, biliary tree, and intestine (2Salen G. Batta A.K. Gastroenterol. Clin. North.

It is strongly activated by bile acids, such as chenodeoxycholic acid, CA, deoxycholic acid, and lithocholic acid (LCA). Activated FXR forms a heterodimer with retinoid X receptor α and binds to its response elements found upstream of FXR target genes (6Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A.

Disruption of the FXR gene in mice clearly demonstrated that FXR serves as a central coordinator for bile acid biosynthesis, metabolism, and transport (12Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that bile acids bind and activate nuclear receptors other than FXR. In FXR-null mice, cyp3a11, a target gene of the pregnane X receptor (PXR; NR1I2) encoding a cytochrome P450 enzyme that facilitates bile acid metabolism and elimination, was significantly up-regulated (13Schuetz E.G. Strom S. Yasuda K. Lecureur V. Assem M. Brimer C. Lamba J. Kim R.B. Ramachandran V. Komoroski B.J. Venkataramanan R. Cai H. Sinal C.J. Gonzalez F.J. Schuetz J.D. J. Biol.

PXR was recently identified as another bile acid sensor and is bound and activated by LCA, deoxycholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid (14Xie W. Radominska-Pandya A. Shi Y. Simon C.M. Nelson M.C.

LCA and its major metabolites also activate the vitamin D receptor (NR1I1 (see Ref. 16Makishima M. Lu T.T. Xie W. Whitfield G.K. Domoto H. Evans R.M. Haussler M.R. Mangelsdorf D.J. Science. 2002; 296: 1313-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar)). Activation of PXR and vitamin D receptor by bile acids leads to the induction of hepatic and/or enteric phase I and phase II metabolizing enzymes, such as CYP3A11 and sulfotransferase (17Sonoda J. Xie W. Rosenfeld J.M. Barwick J.L. Guzelian P.S. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13801-13806Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), indicating the existence of alternative pathways for metabolism and excretion of bile acids. In order to determine, in vivo, whether there is a combined role for FXR and PXR in maintaining bile acid, cholesterol, and lipid homeostasis, the FXR-null mice were cross-bred with PXR-null mice to create FPXR-null mice. FPXR-null mice exhibited a marked disruption of bile acid and cholesterol homeostasis when fed a 1% CA diet. Moreover, CAR and its target genes were induced in FXR- or FPXR-null mice fed the CA diet, and pretreatment with CAR activators, PB or TCPOBOP, resulted in a marked reduction in serum bile acid and bilirubin levels in these animals. This study therefore demonstrates a critical and combined role for FXR and PXR as bile acid sensors and further revealed that induction of CAR provided an additional hepatic defense to maintain bile acid and cholesterol homeostasis.

The primer sequences and reaction conditions used for genotyping the FXR-null allele were reported previously (12Sinal C.J. Tohkin M. Miyata M. Ward J.M. Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). The primer sets used for genotyping the PXR-null mice were as follows: PXR-F1 (5′-CTG GTC ATC ACT GTT GCT GTA CCA-3′), PXR-R2 (5′-GCA GCA TAG GAC AAG TTA TTC TAG AG-3′), and PXR-R3 (5′-CTA AAG CGC ATG CTC CAG ACT GC-3′). Amplification of the PXR WT allele produced a 348-bp product, whereas amplification of the null allele produced a 265-bp product. Diets, Sample Collection, and Histological Analysis—Mice were housed in a pathogen-free animal facility under standard 12-h light/ 12-h dark cycle with access to chow and water ad libitum. All protocols and procedures were approved by the NCI Animal Care and Use Committee and are in accordance with the National Institutes of Health and ALAC Guidelines. All diets were prepared by Bioserv (Frenchtown, NJ) and were based on a standard AIN-93G rodent diet (58.6% carbohydrate, 18.1% protein, 7.2% fat, 0.1% cholesterol, 5.1% fiber, 3.4% ash, and 10% moisture) (12Sinal C.J.

The 1% CA diet consisted of the control diet supplemented with 1% (w/w) CA. Groups of 8–12-week-old males were used for all experiments. At the end of the study, animals were fasted for 4 h in the morning and anesthetized with avertin. Following blood collection from the orbital plexus, animals were euthanized. Tissues were weighed, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until use. Plasma Chemistry—Serum was prepared from whole blood by centrifugation at 6,000 × g using Microtainer serum separator tubes (BD Biosciences). Serum levels of total bile acids, total and direct bilirubin, were measured colorimetrically using corresponding Sigma diagnostics analysis kits. Total cholesterol and triglyceride (Sigma) as well as free cholesterol and phospholipid (Wako, Osaka, Japan) concentrations were measured from 12-μl aliquots of serum using commercial kits and the Hitachi 911 automated chemistry analyzer (Roche Applied Science). Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) separation of serum lipoproteins from pooled plasma samples (60 μl; n = 4–7) was achieved by gel filtration using two Superose 6HR 10/30 columns (Amersham Biosciences) in series as described previously (12Sinal C.J.

Plasma lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity was measured as described previously (19Chen C.H. Albers J.J. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 680-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biliary Bile Acid and Lipid Secretion—Mice were fasted for 4 h in the morning following a 1% CA diet for 4 days. Animals were weighed, anesthetized by avertin (2.5%), and their abdominal cavities opened under sterile conditions. The cystic duct was ligated, and the common bile duct was cannulated. The hepatic bile was collected by gravity for 45 min. Biliary cholesterol, phospholipids, and bile acids (Sigma diagnostic kit) were measured immediately after bile collection. Cloning and Analysis of Gene Expression—Total RNA was prepared using Trizol reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed by electrophoresis in 0.22 m formaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gels.

Probes were 32P-labeled by the random primer method using Ready-to-Go DNA labeling beads (Amersham Biosciences). Western Blot Analysis—Hepatic microsomal proteins were prepared as described previously (21Guo G.L. Choudhuri S. Klaassen C.D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 206-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and 1 μg of protein was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred by electroblotting to GeneScreen Plus membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membranes were incubated with monoclonal anti-rat CYP3A1/2 or polyclonal anti-rat CYP2B antibody (N-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 4 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for CYP3A1/2 or goat anti-rabbit IgG for CYP2B (Sigma). Bands were visualized with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Statistics—Unless otherwise stated, all values were expressed as the mean ± S.E. All data were analyzed by the unpaired Student's t test for statistical significance between each group. Deletion of Both FXR and PXR Results in Severe CA-induced Toxicity—The nuclear receptors, FXR and PXR, play important roles in maintaining bile acid homeostasis. However, the combined role of FXR and PXR in vivo has not been studied, thus FXR-PXR double null mice were generated by cross-breeding PXR-null with FXR-null mice to abolish both FXR and PXR expression in vivo. Under standard housing and dietary conditions, there was no external difference among FPXR-, FXR-, PXR-nulls, or WT mice. However, upon feeding a 1% CA diet for 4 days, FPXR-null mice exhibited the most severe body weight loss, followed by FXR-, PXR-nulls, and WTs (Fig. 1A). Serum bile acids and total and direct bilirubin levels were highest in FPXR-followed by FXR-, PXR-null mice, and WTs fed the CA diet. The serum levels of direct bilirubin or conjugated bilirubin, a direct indicator for hepatic function, were statistically higher in FPXR-null mice than those in FXR-null mice, but there was no statistical significance between FPXR- and FXR-nulls for bile acid and total bilirubin levels (Fig. 1, B–D). Histological examination of the livers by hematoxylin and eosin revealed more fatty metamorphosis in FPXR-, FXR-, and PXR-null mice than WT mice fed the CA diet, but the degree was similar (data not shown). Disruption of Serum Cholesterol and Lipid Homeostasis in FPXR-null Mice—Because bile acid synthesis and excretion represents the major pathway for elimination of cholesterol, we examined cholesterol and lipid levels in these animals. On a control diet, the plasma levels of cholesterol were highest in FXR-null mice, followed by FPXR- and PXR-null mice, compared with WT mice; and plasma triglycerides (TG) and phospholipids (PL) were elevated in both FXR- and FPXR-null mice followed by PXR-null and WT mice. The CA diet lowered the plasma lipid levels in FXR-null and PXR-null mice but increased those of FPXR-null mice (Fig. 2A). The serum contents of cholesterol and lipid were further analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) using pooled serum samples. This revealed that the dramatic hyperlipidemia observed in FXR- and FPXR-null mice on a control diet was mostly due to increased quantities of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and large HDL1 particles (Fig. 2B, panels A and B), accompanied by an increase in plasma apoE and apoB100 (Fig. 2B, panel A, inset). The plasma FPLC profiles of WT and PXR-null mice predominantly consisted of HDL particles that were only slightly affected by the CA diet. In contrast, the CA diet resulted in a dramatic shift in the elution of VLDL and IDL/LDL in FPXR-nulls and to a lesser degree in FXR-nulls (Fig. 2B, panels C and D). There was a virtual absence of HDL particles in the plasma of FPXR-null mice fed the CA diet. Consistent with these data, plasma apoA-I and apoA-II levels were reduced, whereas levels of apoB100 were increased in FPXR-null mice fed the CA diet (Fig. 2B, panel C, inset). The PL elution profiles were similar to those of total cholesterol, and the TG profiles were similar to those of free cholesterol in all groups and for both diets (data not shown). Biliary Excretion of Bile Acids, Cholesterol, and Phospholipids—Because FXR and PXR regulate many genes encoding hepatic canalicular transporters, biliary excretion of bile acids, cholesterol, and phospholipids was determined in WTs, PXR-, FXR-, and FPXR-null mice fed the 1% CA diet for 4 days to saturated their hepatic biliary secretion ability, as described previously (20Lambert G. Marcelo J.A. Amar G.G. Brewer Jr., H.B. Gonzalez F.J. Sinal C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2563-2570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Under these experimental conditions, the flow of biliary cholesterol and phospholipid, measured after cannulation of the common bile duct, was dramatically reduced in FPXR-nulls, followed by FXR-nulls but unchanged in PXR-nulls, compared with WTs (Fig. 3, A and B). The bile acid output was similar in WTs, PXR-, and FXR-nulls but dramatically reduced in FPXR-nulls (Fig. 3C), indicating that loss of both PXR and FXR in mice leads to the most severe impairment of biliary excretion. Expression of the Major Genes Involved in Cholesterol and Lipid Metabolism—To understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the severe disturbances of lipoprotein homeostasis in FPXR-nulls, especially after CA feeding, the hepatic expression levels of the major genes involved in cholesterol and lipid metabolism were determined by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 4). Among the major apolipoproteins, only the expression of apoA-I, apoA-II, apoE, and apoB was increased in FXR- and FPXR-null mice after CA feeding; expression of other apolipoproteins was either not altered (apoC-I, apoC-II) or up-regulated by the CA diet regardless of genotype (apoA-V; data not shown). The levels of ABCA1 and CD36 mRNA were also increased in the livers of FXR- and FPXR-null mice fed the CA diet, whereas those of SRB1 and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c were lower in FXR- and FPXR-nulls. In addition, feeding of CA resulted in a dramatic reduction of plasma LCAT activity in FXR- and FPXR-nulls (5.8 ± 2.1 and 3.7 ± 1.4 nmol cholesterol esterification/ml/h, respectively) compared with WTs and PXR-nulls, respectively (21.2 ± 0.9 and 19.4 ± 3.2 nmol CE/ml/h, n = 4, p < 0.05). There was a dose-dependent and positive correlation between the concentration of bile acids and the inhibition of LCAT activity in the plasma of the animals, suggesting a specific inhibition of LCAT activity by bile acids (data not shown). Hepatic Expression of the Genes Associated with Bile Acid Metabolism and Transport—To understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for defective biliary secretion in FPXR-null mice, the hepatic expression of the major genes involved in bile acid production, metabolism, and transport was determined (Fig. 5). With the control diet, expression levels of the rate-limiting enzyme for bile acid synthesis, CYP7A1, were decreased in PXR-nulls, elevated in FXR-nulls, and markedly reduced in FPXR-nulls. With the CA diet, CYP7A1 mRNA levels were strongly repressed in WTs and PXR-nulls, weakly in FXR-nulls, but not altered in FPXR-nulls. Basal levels of CYP3A11 mRNA were induced in PXR-, FXR-, and FPXR-nulls but were only further elevated in FXR-nulls fed the CA diet. Basal mRNA levels of the nuclear hormone receptor CAR and its classical target gene, CYP2B, were markedly increased in FXR-nulls and to a lesser degree in FPXR-nulls. The CA diet further induced CAR and CYP2B mRNA levels in FXR-nulls, followed by in FPXR- and PXR-nulls. Basal mRNA levels of the bile salt export pump, BSEP, were higher in PXR-nulls, lower in FXR-nulls, and unchanged in FPXR-nulls fed the control diet. Feeding the CA diet led to an induction of BSEP in WTs and PXR-nulls but a further suppression in FXR- and FPXR-nulls. The expression pattern of MDR1a followed that of CYP3A11, whereas the levels of MRP2 and MRP3 mRNA were slightly induced in FPXR-nulls on the CA diet (1.6- and 2-fold, respectively). On the control diet, the mRNA levels of the biliary phospholipid transporter MDR2, the biliary cholesterol half-transporter ABCG8, and the biliary cholesterol half-transporter ABCG5 appeared to be not altered in FXR- or FPXR-nulls on control diet, but all were induced to a similar degree by the CA diet. With the CA diet, the levels of ABCG1 were suppressed in WTs and PXR-nulls but were up-regulated in FXR- and FPXR-nulls. Levels of other nuclear hormone receptors (retinoid X receptor α, LXRα, HNF4α, and PPARα) were not altered in these four strains regardless of the diet (data not shown). Hepatic Protein Levels of CYP3A and CYP2B—Because hepatic mRNA levels of CYP3A11 and CYP2B in FXR- and FPXR-null mice were increased following a 1% CA diet, their protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 6). Similar to their mRNA levels, basal protein levels of CYP3A were increased in PXR-, FXR-, and FPXR-null mice, with the highest elevation in the latter animals. However, feeding the 1% CA diet only resulted in increased CYP3A protein levels in WTs, PXR-, and FXR-nulls but not in FPXR-nulls, indicating that activation of PXR is mainly responsible for induction of CYP3A in FXR-null mice. Basal levels of CYP2B protein in FPXR-null mice were slightly increased compared with WTs (1.5-fold), which was further increased by feeding with the CA diet (1.8-fold). Compared with CYP3A, the degree of CYP2B induction was much lower. Protection of CA Toxicity in FXR- and FPXR Null Mice by Pretreatment with PB or TCPOBOP—Because CAR and CYP2B were induced in FXR- and FPXR-null mice, it was hypothesized that activation of both CAR and CYP2B might reduce the overt hepatic toxicity by bile acids. To test this possibility, two CAR activators, PB (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, with saline as control) or TCPOBOP (3 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, with corn oil as control), were administered 2 days before the CA diet feeding was initiated, and the treatment was continued for an additional 4 days with coadministration of the CA diet. Cotreatment of PB or TCPOBOP with CA significantly lowered the serum bile acids and total and direct bilirubin levels in FXR- and FPXR-null mice compared with treatment with CA alone, strongly indicating that activation of CAR reduced the overt bile acid toxicity (Fig. 7, A–C). Hepatic Expression of the Genes for Bile Acid and Bilirubin Metabolism and Transport following PB or TCPOBOP Treatment—To determine the mechanism by which PB or TCPOBOP treatment effectively prevented the elevation of serum bile acid and bilirubin levels in CA-fed FXR- or FPXR-null mice, mRNA levels of the major genes involved in bile acid and/or bilirubin metabolism and transport were determined (Fig. 8). Treatment with the CAR activators induced the levels of CYP2B, CYP3A11, UGT1a, GSTα, MRP2, MRP3, and organic anion transporting polypeptide 2, leading to increased metabolism and excretion of bile acids and bilirubin. Surprisingly, the mRNA levels of ALAS1, the rate-limiting enzyme for bilirubin synthesis, were induced by the CAR activators as well. Because the net levels of serum bilirubin were decreased following treatment with the CAR activators, the possibility exists that the degree for induction of bilirubin synthesis was lower than that for its metabolism and excretion. Furthermore, PB and TCPOBOP affected the CAR mRNA levels differently; PB induced CAR mRNA in WT and PXR-null mice but not in FXR- and FPXR-null mice; in contrast, TCPOBOP did not affect CAR mRNA levels in WT mice, and it prevented the induction of CAR mRNA by CA in PXR-, FXR-, and FPXR-null mice. PB and TCPOBOP also differentially affected MDR1a; PB induced but TCPOBOP repressed MDR1a mRNA levels. PB and TCPOBOP tended to reduce the CA toxicity not only by inducing metabolism enzymes and export transporters but also by inhibiting the main bile acid uptake transporter, Na+/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide. The mRNA levels of BSEP were not affected by the pretreatment with CAR activators (data not shown). In summary, pretreatment with the CAR activators reduced bile acid uptake but enhanced their metabolism and excretion, particularly in FXR- and FPXR-null mice fed with a CA diet, thus resulting in a lower bile acid or bilirubin content in the circulation. Following the discovery that FXR was a key nuclear receptor for regulating bile acid levels (5Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Bledsoe R.K. Chandra G. Consler T.G. Kliewer S.A. Stimmel J.B. Willson T.M.

These records suggest close coupling of mid-southern latitudes with Antarctic climate during deglacial and interglacial periods. Glacial sections display higher variability than is seen in Antarctic ice cores, which implies climatic decoupling between mid- and high southern latitudes due to enhanced circum-Antarctic circulation. Structural and temporal similarity with the Greenland ice core record is evident in glacial sections and suggests a degree of interhemispheric synchroneity not predicted from bipolar ice core correlations."

Northern blot analysis revealed predominant expression of Oatp14 in the brain, and Western blot analysis revealed its expression in the brain capillary and choroid plexus. Immunohistochemical staining indicated that Oatp14 is expressed in the border of the brain capillary endothelial cells. When expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, Oatp14 transports thyroxine (T4; prothyroid hormone) (Km = 0.18 μm), as well as amphipathic organic anions such as 17β estradiol-d-17β-glucuronide (Km = 10 μm), cerivastatin (Km = 1.3 μm), and troglitazone sulfate (Km = 0.76 μm). The uptake of triiodothyronine (T3), an active form produced from T4, was significantly greater in Oatp14-expressed cells than in vector-transfected cells, but the transport activity for T3 was ∼6-fold lower that for T4. The efflux of T4, preloaded into the cells, from Oatp14-expressed cells was more rapid than that from vector-transfected cells (0.032 versus 0.006 min–1). Therefore, Oatp14 can mediate a bidirectional transport of T4. Sulfobromophthalein, taurocholate, and estrone sulfate were potent inhibitors for Oatp14, whereas digoxin, p-aminohippurate, or leukotriene C4, or organic cations such as tetraetheylammonium or cimetidine had no effect. The expression levels of Oatp14 mRNA and protein were up- and down-regulated under hypo- and hyperthyroid conditions, respectively. Therefore, it may be speculated that Oatp14 plays a role in maintaining the concentration of T4 and, ultimately, T3 in the brain by transporting T4 from the circulating blood to the brain.

Brain capillary endothelial cells are characterized by tightly sealed cellular junctions (tight junctions) and the paucity of fenestra and pinocytotic vesicles, which prevent free exchange between brain and blood (1Rapoport S.I.

Therefore, the uptake of nutrients by the brain occurs through the brain capillary endothelial cells via specific transport systems (3Minn A. Ghersi-Egea J.F. Perrin R. Leininger B. Siest G.

The uptake of [d-penicillamine2,5]-enkephalin (DPDPE) from the blood to the brain was determined by the brain perfusion technique in the presence and absence of Oatp2 inhibitors (17Dagenais C.

The brain uptake of DPDPE was increased in Mdr1a (P-glycoprotein) gene knockout mice, and the uptake in Mdr1a knockout mice was inhibited by the substrates and inhibitors of rat Oatp2 such as digoxin and 17β estradiol-d-17β-glucuronide (E217βG). Vice versa, when E217βG was microinjected into the cerebral cortex, the subsequent elimination of E217βG from the brain was carrier-mediated (18Sugiyama D. Kusuhara H. Shitara Y. Abe T. Meier P.J. Sekine T. Endou H. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Partial inhibition by digoxin suggested that additional efflux transport system(s) for E217βG, which is taurocholate- and probenecid-sensitive, is involved in the brain capillary. Li et al. (19Li J.Y. Boado R. Pardridge W.M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2001; 21: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) recently identified BBB-specific anion transporter 1 (BSAT1) using gene microarray techniques by comparing the gene expression profile of cDNA from the brain capillary with that from the liver and kidney. BSAT1 cDNA consisted of 2148 bp that encoded a 716-amino acid residues protein with 12 putative membrane-spanning domains. BSAT1 was highly enriched in the brain capillary compared with brain homogenate, liver, and kidney. Comparison of the cDNA sequences of BSAT1 revealed that it is the 14th member of the Oatp/OATP family (Oatp14). Although the localization at the BBB and the substrates of this isoform remain unknown, BBB-specific expression prompted us to hypothesize that Oatp14 accounts for the efflux of organic anions including E217βG via the BBB, together with Oatp2. The purpose of the present study is to characterize the substrate specificity and spectrum of inhibitors of Oatp14, as well as its tissue distribution and localization. Through this study, we found out that thyroxine (T4) is a good substrate of Oatp14, and the expression level of Oatp14 in the BBB is affected by plasma thyroid conditions. The results of the present study suggest that Oatp14 plays an important role in regulating the concentration of T4 in the central nervous system and in brain development.

Neurochem. 1991; 57: 2136-2139Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). All steps in the isolation procedure were carried out at 4 °C in pregassed (95% O2-5% CO2) solutions. Briefly, pieces of gray matter were gently homogenized in three volumes (v/w) of an artificial extracellular fluid buffer and, after addition of dextran (final concentration 15%), the homogenate was centrifuged at low speed. The resulting pellet was resuspended in Buffer B (103 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm d-glucose, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm K2HPO4, and 15 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) and then filtered through a 200-μm nylon mesh. The filtrate was passed over a column of glass beads, and after washing with Buffer B, the capillaries adhering to the beads were collected by gentle agitation. Northern Blot Analysis—A commercially available hybridization blot containing poly(A)+ RNA from various rat tissues (rat multi-tissue Northern blot; Clontech) was used for the Northern blot analysis. A fragment (position numbers 1–807) from Oatp14 was used as a probe, and its nucleotide sequence showed less than 60% identity with other members of the Oatp family. The master blot filter was hybridized with the 32P-labeled probe at 68 °C according to manufacturer's instructions. The filter was washed finally under high stringency conditions (0.1× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate)) and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and then exposed to Fuji imaging plates (Fuji Photo Film, Kanagawa, Japan) for 3 h at room temperature and examined using an imaging analyzer (BAS 2000; Fuji Photo Film). Western Blot Analysis—Antiserum against Oatp14 was raised in rabbits against a synthetic peptide consisting of the 17 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of Oatp14. Antiserum was purified by affinity column chromatography using the antigen and used for subsequent analyses. Choroid plexus, brain homogenate, and isolated brain capillary samples were diluted with Loading Buffer (BioLabs, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom). They were then boiled for 3 min and loaded onto an 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel with a 3.75% stacking gel. Proteins were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Pall Filtran, Karlstein, Germany) using a blotter (Trans-blot; Bio-Rad) at 15 V for 1 h. The membrane was blocked with TBS-T (Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20) and 5% skimmed milk for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with TBS-T, the membrane was incubated with the antibodies (dilution 1:1000). The membrane was allowed to bind a horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:5000 in TBS-T for 1 h at room temperature followed by washing with TBS-T. Immunohistochemical Study—Frozen sections from male Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared for the immunohistochemical study after fixing in acetone (–20 °C). The brain slices adhered to the glass cover slips were washed with PBS and fixed for 10 min on ice in acetone. After washing with PBS, the capillaries were permearized in 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS and incubated with peroxidase blocking reagent (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) for 10 min at room temperature to block nonspecific peroxidase. Slices were incubated with anti-Oatp14 antibody (1:100) for 60 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and subsequently incubated for 60 min at room temperature with the horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Envision+ system; DAKO). The immune reaction was visualized using diaminobenzidine and then nuclei were stained with hematoxylin (DAKO). The specificity of the antibody reaction was verified by negative controls, which were incubated with polyclonal antibody that had been blocked with the antigenic peptide. Cloning of Rat Oatp14 cDNA—Based on the nucleotide sequence reported by Li et al. (19Li J.Y. Boado R. Pardridge W.M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2001; 21: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) (GenBank™ accession number NM 053441), the following primers were designed to isolate Oatp14 cDNA encoding a full open reading frame of Oatp14: forward primer, 5′-ggaattccgccaccatggacacttcatccaaaga-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-ggattccttaaagtcgggtctccttgc-3′. PCR was performed using cDNA prepared from rat brain as template according to the following protocol: 96 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min; 50 cycles. PCR products were subcloned to pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced. The nucleotide sequence of rat Oatp14 cDNA was identical as being that of BSAT1 except for one base change (A175G) resulting in a change of amino acid (T59A). However, it was confirmed that this change was not because of an error accumulated during PCR by sequencing the RT-PCR products directly. Stable Expression of Oatp14 cDNA in HEK293 Cells—The Oatp14-cDNA was subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) and introduced into HEK293 cells by lipofection with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's protocol and were selected by culturing them in the presence of G418 sulfate (800 μg/ml; Invitrogen). HEK293 cells were grown in minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and G418 sulfate (400 μg/ml) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity. Cells were incubated for 24 h before starting the experiments with culture medium supplemented with sodium butyrate (5 mm). Transport Study—Uptake was initiated by adding the radiolabeled ligands to the incubating buffer in the presence and absence of inhibitors after cells had been washed three times and preincubated with Krebs-Henseleit buffer (142 mm NaCl, 23.8 mm NaHCO3, 4.83 mm KCl, 0.96 mm KH2PO4, 1.20 mm MgSO4, 12.5 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, and 1.53 mm CaCl2, adjusted to pH 7.4) at 37 °C for 15 min. For the efflux study, cells were preincubated with [125I]T4 at 37 °C for 15 min and washed three times with ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer, followed by incubation in the absence of [125I]T4 with Krebs-Henseleit buffer at 37 °C. The uptake and efflux were terminated at designed times by adding ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer. The radioactivity associated with the cells and medium specimens was determined in a liquid scintillation counter. The remaining aliquots of cell lysates were used to determine protein concentrations by the method of Lowry (23Lowry O. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Ligand uptake is given as the cell-to-medium concentration ratio determined as the amount of ligand associated with the cells divided by the medium concentration. Specific uptake was obtained by subtracting the uptake by vector-transfected cells from that by Oatp14-expressed cells. Kinetic Analyses—Kinetic parameters were obtained from the following Michaelis-Menten equation, v = V max S/(Km + S), where v is the uptake rate of the substrate (pmol/min/mg protein), S is the substrate concentration in the medium (μm), Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant (μm), and V max is the maximum uptake rate (pmol/min/mg protein). To obtain the kinetic parameters, the equation was fitted to the initial uptake velocity. The experimental data were fitted to the equation by nonlinear regression analysis with weighting as the reciprocal of the observed values, and the Damping Gauss Newton Method algorithm was used for fitting. Inhibition constants (Ki) for Oatp14-mediated transport were calculated assuming competitive inhibition. Production of Hyperthyroid and Hypothyroid Conditions—Male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 200–220 g, were purchased from Japan SLC (Shizuoka, Japan). Rats had free access to food and water at all times during the study. Production of hyperthyroid and hypothyroid conditions involved a modification of the procedure of Burmeister et al. (24Burmeister L.A. Pachucki J. Germain D.L.S. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5231-5237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hypothyroidism was induced by the addition of 0.05% methimazole (MMI), an inhibitor for thyroid hormone synthesis in the thyroid gland, to the drinking water or thyroidectomy. Hypothyroidism was assessed clinically by failure to gain weight at the expected rate and could be observed within 2 weeks of the beginning MMI treatment and within 1 week after thyroidectomy. Hyperthyrodism was produced by giving L-T3 (50 μg/100 g body weight, subcutaneously, daily) 4 days before capillary isolation. Tissue Distribution of Oatp14 —The expression of Oatp14 mRNA in rat tissues was investigated by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1A). A band was detected at 2.6 kbp, predominantly in the brain. No hybridization signals were detected in mRNA isolated from other tissues, including the heart, spleen, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and testis. Immunoblot and Immunohistochemical Staining of Oatp14— The expression of Oatp14 in the choroid plexus, brain homogenate, and brain capillary was examined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B). Immunoreactive protein was detected at ∼90 kDa in the choroid plexus, brain homogenate, and brain capillary. These bands were abolished when preabsorbed polyclonal antibody for Oatp14 was used, suggesting that the positive bands were specific for the antigen peptide. To investigate the localization of Oatp14 in brain capillary endothelial cells, immunohistochemical staining was carried out using anti-Oatp14 polyclonal antibody (Fig. 2). Positive signals for anti-Oatp14 polyclonal antibody were detected in brain capillary endothelial cells. The signals were detected along the plasma membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells. The signal was abolished by preincubating the polyclonal antibody of Oatp14 with antigen (data not shown). Transport Properties of Oatp14 — Fig. 3 shows the time profiles of the uptake of [3H]E217βG (A), [14C]cerivastatin (B), [35S]TRO-S (C), and [125I]T4 (D) by Oatp14-expressed HEK293 cells and vector-transfected HEK293 cells. Their uptake by Oatp14-expressed cells is markedly greater than that by vector-transfected cells. This Oatp14-mediated uptake showed saturation kinetics and followed the Michaelis-Menten equation (Fig. 3, E-H). The kinetic parameters for the uptake by Oatp14 were determined by nonlinear regression analysis and summarized in Table I. The uptake of various organic anions by Oatp14 was investigated, and the results are summarized in Table II. The uptake of [14C]E3040 glucuronide, [14C]E3040 sulfate, [14C]4-MUS, and [125I]reverse T3 by Oatp14-expressed cells was significantly greater compared with that by vector-transfected (Table II). Although the triiodothyronine (T3) uptake by Oatp14-expressed cells was significantly greater than that by vector-transfected cells, the Oatp14-mediated uptake for T3 was ∼6-fold smaller than that of T4 and reverse T3 by Oatp14 (Table II). The difference in the uptake of [3H]taurocholate, [3H]TLCS, [3H]testosterone, [3H]dihydrotestosterone, [3H]estrone, [3H]estrone sulfate (ES), [3H]dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, [3H]leukotriene E4 (LTE4), [3H]Leu-enkephalin, [3H]cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-8), [125I]T3, [3H]pravastatin, [3H]ketoprofen, and [3H]ochratoxin A was statistically significant between Oatp14-expressed and vector-transfected cells, although the rates of uptake were very low (Table II).Table ISubstrate specificity of Oatp14SubstratesOatp14pcDNARatio, Oatp14/pcDNAμl/mg protein/15 minCA5.66 ± 0.305.24 ± 0.431.1 ± 0.1GCA18.7 ± 2.315.7 ± 1.61.2 ± 0.2TCA8.09 ± 0.526.06 ± 0.101.3 ± 0.1aStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.05.LCA576 ± 6535 ± 181.1 ± 0.0CDCA65.7 ± 6.784.1 ± 11.50.8 ± 0.1UDCA10.5 ± 0.19.71 ± 0.351.1 ± 0.0TLCS61.5 ± 1.943.7 ± 1.71.4 ± 0.1Estradiol204 ± 4186 ± 131.1 ± 0.1Testosterone52.3 ± 1.539.2 ± 1.41.3 ± 0.1bStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.01.Dihydrotestosterone147 ± 15106 ± 51.4 ± 0.2bStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.01.Corticosterone24.7 ± 1.520.9 ± 0.51.2 ± 0.1Estrone303 ± 15248 ± 61.2 ± 0.1aStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.05.DHEAS9.68 ± 0.247.72 ± 0.481.3 ± 0.1aStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.05.Estrone-sulfate11.1 ± 0.86.3 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.1aStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.05.E217βG50.1 ± 4.72.4 ± 0.221.2 ± 2.9bStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.01.LTC414.5 ± 0.613.4 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.0bStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.01.LTD419.6 ± 0.818.0 ± 2.01.1 ± 0.1LTE430.5 ± 1.326.0 ± 0.91.2 ± 0.1aStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.05.PGD23.50 ± 0.153.61 ± 0.121.0 ± 0.1PGE26.99 ± 0.465.80 ± 0.241.2 ± 0.1Leu-Enkephalin54.2 ± 2.943.3 ± 2.51.3 ± 0.1aStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.05.CCK-82.58 ± 0.211.81 ± 0.131.4 ± 0.2aStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.05.T3951 ± 16733 ± 41.3 ± 0.0bStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.01.Reverse T31397 ± 7971 ± 519.7 ± 1.7bStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.01.T41456 ± 10124 ± 311.8 ± 0.3bStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.01.Ketoprofen9.53 ± 0.426.91 ± 0.261.4 ± 0.1bStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.01.Ibuprofen3.18 ± 0.113.99 ± 1.180.8 ± 0.2Indomethacin31.3 ± 0.934.3 ± 2.00.9 ± 0.1Benzylpenicillin5.76 ± 0.475.45 ± 0.121.1 ± 0.1OchratoxinA8.58 ± 1.295.81 ± 0.141.5 ± 0.2bStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.01.Qunidine1390 ± 341274 ± 1501.1 ± 0.1Cerivastatin105 ± 233 ± 13.1 ± 0.1bStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.01.Pravastatin5.62 ± 0.383.50 ± 0.751.6 ± 0.4aStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.05.Digoxin8.70 ± 0.139.96 ± 0.220.9 ± 0.0E3040106 ± 393 ± 51.1 ± 0.1E3040G10.7 ± 1.02.12 ± 0.225.1 ± 0.7aStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.05.E3040S4.78 ± 0.351.69 ± 0.262.8 ± 0.5bStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.01.4MUS1.82 ± 0.350.90 ± 0.032.0 ± 0.1bStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.01.Troglitazone-sulfate64.1 ± 14.38.4 ± 0.47.6 ± 1.7bStatistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.01.a Statistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.05.b Statistically significant uptake is indicated. p < 0.01.

The radioactivity associated with cell specimens was rapidly reduced in Oatp14-expressed HEK293 cells compared with that in vector-transfected cells, and the elimination rate constants were 0.032 ± 0.002 and 0.006 ± 0.001 min–1, respectively (Fig. 4). cis-inhibitory effects on the Oatp14-mediated uptake of [3H]E217βG were investigated (Fig. 5). Sulfobromophthalein (BSP), pravastatin, ES, and trichloroacetic acid were potent inhibitors of Oatp14, whereas probenecid was a moderate inhibitor (Fig. 5). p-Aminohippurate and cimetidine, typical substrates of organic anion and cation transporters, had no effect on the Oatp14-mediated uptake, whereas benzylpenicillin was a weak inhibitor (Fig. 6). Leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and glutathione (GSH) had no effect, but dinitrophenyl-s-glutathione (DNP-SG) was a weak inhibitor (see Figs. 5 and 6). No inhibitory effect by folates (methotrexate, folate, and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate) or tetraethylammonium was observed (Fig. 6). The Ki values of probenecid, BSP, trichloroacetic acid, ES, DNP-SG, DPDPE, T3, and T4 for the uptake of [3H]E217βG by Oatp14-expressed HEK cells are summarized in Table III.Fig. 5Effects of unlabeled probenecid, BSP, trichloroacetic acid, ES, DNP-SG, DPDPE, T3, and T4 on the uptake of [3H]E217βGby Oatp14-transfected HEK293 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2032398431,"The measurement sensitivity of the pointing direction of a laser beam is ultimately limited by the quantum nature of light. To reduce this limit, we have experimentally produced a quantum laser pointer, a beam of light whose direction is measured with a precision greater than that possible for a usual laser beam. The laser pointer is generated by combining three different beams in three orthogonal transverse modes, two of them in a squeezed-vacuum state and one in an intense coherent field. The result provides a demonstration of multichannel spatial squeezing, along with its application to the improvement of beam positioning sensitivity and, more generally, to imaging."

https://openalex.org/W2022725907,"alpha-Amino acids can undergo peptide formation by activation with carbon monoxide (CO) under hot aqueous conditions in the presence of freshly coprecipitated colloidal (Fe,Ni)S. We now show that CO-driven peptide formation proceeds concomitantly with CO-driven, N-terminal peptide degradation by racemizing N-terminal hydantoin and urea derivatives to alpha-amino acids. This establishes a peptide cycle with closely related anabolic and catabolic segments. The hydantoin derivative is a purin-related heterocycle. The (Fe,Ni)S-dependent urea hydrolysis could have been the evolutionary precursor of the nickelenzyme urease. The results support the theory of a chemoautotrophic origin of life with a CO-driven, (Fe,Ni)S-dependent primordial metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2096110602,"The AICD (amyloid precursor protein [APP] intracellular domain) and C31, the caspase-cleaved C-terminal fragment of APP, have been found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the C-terminal fragments of APP (AICD [C57, C59] and C31) exert neurotoxicity on differentiated PC 12 cells and rat primary cortical neurons by inducing the expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta, forming a ternary complex with Fe65 and CP2/LSF/LBP1 in the nucleus, whereas deletion mutants and a point mutant with Y682G of the YENPTY domain, a Fe65 binding domain, do not. Moreover, expression of APP770 and Swedish mutant form of APP increased the levels of C-terminal fragments of APP (APP-CTs) in neuronal cells and also induced the up-regulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta at both the mRNA and the protein levels. In addition, we show that CP2/LSF/LBP1 binding site (nt +0 to approximately +10) in human glycogen synthase kinase 3beta promoter region is essential for the induction of the gene transcription by APP-CTs. The neurotoxicities induced by APP-CTs (AICD and C31) were accompanied by an increase in the active form of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta, and by the induction of tau phosphorylation and a reduction in nuclear beta-catenin levels, and led to apoptosis."

Now HIV threatens control of TB in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America. Antiretroviral (ARV) drugs can prevent TB by preserving immunity, but cohort analysis shows that early therapy, plus high levels of coverage and compliance, will be needed to avert a significant fraction of TB cases. However, ARV drugs could enhance the treatment of TB, and TB programs provide an important entry point for the treatment of HIV/AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W1965903181,"Genes associated with Hirschsprung disease, a failure to form enteric ganglia in the hindgut, were highly up-regulated in gut neural crest stem cells relative to whole-fetus RNA. One of these genes, the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) receptor Ret, was necessary for neural crest stem cell migration in the gut. GDNF promoted the migration of neural crest stem cells in culture but did not affect their survival or proliferation. Gene expression profiling, combined with reverse genetics and analyses of stem cell function, suggests that Hirschsprung disease is caused by defects in neural crest stem cell function."
https://openalex.org/W2000343242,"The protein-tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 is required for normal activation of the ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase in multiple receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways. In fibroblasts, Shp2 undergoes phosphorylation at two C-terminal tyrosyl residues in response to some (fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)) but not all (epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factor) growth factors. Whereas the catalytic activity of Shp2 is required for all Shp2 actions, the effect of tyrosyl phosphorylation on Shp2 function has been controversial. To clarify the role of Shp2 tyrosyl phosphorylation, we infected Shp2-mutant fibroblasts with retroviruses expressing wild type Shp2 or mutants of either (Y542F or Y580F) or both (Y542F,Y580F) C-terminal tyrosines. Compared with wild type cells, ERK activation was decreased in Y542F- or Y580F-infected cells in response to fibroblast growth factor and PDGF but not the epidermal growth factor. Mutation of both phosphorylation sites resulted in a further decrease in growth factor-evoked ERK activation, although not to the level of the vector control. Immunoblot analyses confirm that Tyr-542 and Tyr-580 are the major sites of Shp2 tyrosyl phosphorylation and that Tyr-542 is the major Grb2 binding site. However, studies with antibodies specific for individual Shp2 phosphorylation sites reveal unexpected complexity in the mechanism of Shp2 tyrosyl phosphorylation by different receptor tyrosine kinases. Moreover, because Y580F mutants retain nearly wild type Grb2-binding ability, yet exhibit defective PDGF-evoked ERK activation, our results show that the association of Grb2 with Shp2 is not sufficient for promoting full ERK activation in response to these growth factors, thereby arguing strongly against the “Grb2-adapter” model of Shp2 action.

Many signaling pathways regulating cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and migration involve protein-tyrosyl phosphorylation which, in turn, is controlled by protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) 1The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; RPTPα, receptor PTP α; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; SH2, Src homology; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFR, PDGF receptor; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; Csw, corkscrew; WT, wild type; SFK, Src family kinase; SYF, cells deficient in Src, Fyn, and Yes.1The abbreviations used are: PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; RPTPα, receptor PTP α; RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; SH2, Src homology; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PDGFR, PDGF receptor; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; Csw, corkscrew; WT, wild type; SFK, Src family kinase; SYF, cells deficient in Src, Fyn, and Yes. and protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Most peptide growth factor receptors are transmembrane PTKs, termed receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Ligand binding activates the intrinsic PTK activity of RTKs, leading to the phosphorylation of several substrates, most of which have Src homology-2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine-binding domains. Tyrosyl phosphorylation of such signal relay molecules can alter their structure and/or function, thereby regulating enzyme activity, protein localization, and/or the assembly of multimeric signaling complexes (1Hunter T. Cell. 2000; 100: 113-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2231) Google Scholar). These events, in turn, control downstream signaling pathways, such as the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK cascade (2Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2266) Google Scholar, 3Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). Shp2 is a ubiquitously expressed non-transmembrane PTP that plays an essential role in most, if not all, RTK signaling pathways. In all of these pathways, Shp2 function is required for normal activation of the ERK MAPK and its downstream transcriptional targets (4Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 5Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 6Van Vactor D.

Experiments using dominant negative (catalytically inactive) Shp2 as well as studies of primary fibroblasts and cell lines from Shp2 mutant mice generated by homologous recombination (8Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2352-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar) have shown that Shp2 acts upstream of Ras in insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) (9Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling (10Shi Z.Q. Yu D.H. Park M. Marshall M. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1526-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Although likely, it has not been shown that Shp2 acts upstream of Ras in other RTK signaling pathways. Moreover, studies of mammalian cell systems as well as genetic analyses of the Drosophila Shp2 ortholog Corkscrew (Csw) suggest that Shp2 also acts downstream of Ras and/or in a parallel signaling pathway (5Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 6Van Vactor D. O'Reilly A.M. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Like its close relative Shp1, Shp2 contains two N-terminal SH2 domains, a tyrosine phosphatase catalytic (PTP) domain, a C terminus with two tyrosyl phosphorylation sites, Tyr-542 and Tyr-580, and an interposed proline-rich domain (Fig. 1A). Multiple studies have established that PTP activity is required for all actions of Shp2, including its role in the Ras/ERK pathway (5Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 6Van Vactor D. O'Reilly A.M. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 112-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast, the molecular details and functional consequences of tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shp2 have remained controversial. Shp2 undergoes phosphorylation at both Tyr-542 and Tyr-580 in response to many (but not all) stimuli, including many (but not all) peptide growth factors (11Feng G.S. Hui C.C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 12Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 13Lechleider R.J. Freeman Jr., R.M. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13434-13438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these sites conform to the consensus for binding to the Grb2 SH2 domain (YXNX), and, accordingly, tyrosyl-phosphorylated Shp2 binds Grb2. But whereas Bennett et al. reported that Tyr-542 is the major phosphorylation and Grb2 association site (14Bennett A.M. Tang T.L. Sugimoto S. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7335-7339Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), two other studies concluded that Tyr-580 is the major Grb2 binding site (15Vogel W. Ullrich A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1589-1597PubMed Google Scholar, 16Keegan K. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1537-1544PubMed Google Scholar). The reason(s) for these discrepancies is (are) not clear. The effects of tyrosyl phosphorylation on Shp2 enzymatic activity and RTK signaling are also in dispute. The finding that Grb2 binds tyrosyl-phosphorylated Shp2, together with the requirement for Shp2 upstream of Ras in the ERK pathway (see above), suggested an “adapter model” of Shp2 action (14Bennett A.M. Tang T.L. Sugimoto S. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7335-7339Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 17Li W. Nishimura R. Kashishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, tyrosyl-phosphorylated Shp2 contributes to Ras (and, ultimately, ERK) activation by recruiting Grb2/Sos complexes to the vicinity of the plasma membrane; hence, Shp2 functions as an adapter. Notably, it is unclear how the requirement for Shp2 catalytic activity can be reconciled with this model. Others have argued that tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shp2 stimulates its catalytic activity (12Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 18Lu W. Gong D. Bar-Sagi D. Cole P.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 759-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Early studies found a temporal correlation between Shp2 tyrosyl phosphorylation and increased Shp2 activity (12Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). However, upon growth factor stimulation, Shp2 binds via its SH2 domains to RTKs and/or scaffolding adapters (e.g. Gab/Dos, insulin receptor substrate (IRS), and fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate (FRS) family members) at the same time that it becomes tyrosyl phosphorylated (11Feng G.S. Hui C.C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 12Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 13Lechleider R.J. Freeman Jr., R.M. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13434-13438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because engagement of the SH2 domains of Shp2 markedly enhances PTP activity (19Barford D. Neel B.G. Structure. 1998; 6: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), these early studies could not distinguish between the effects of tyrosyl phosphorylation and SH2 domain engagement on Shp2 catalytic activity. More recently, protein ligation techniques were used to introduce a phosphonate at either Tyr-542 or Tyr-580 of Shp2 (18Lu W. Gong D. Bar-Sagi D. Cole P.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 759-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Phosphonate incorporation at Tyr-542 resulted in intramolecular binding to the N-terminal SH2, whereas phosphono-Tyr-580 binds to the C-terminal SH2. Moreover, both phosphonate derivatives were found to stimulate catalytic activity (to an extent similar to SH2 domain engagement) and display enhanced biological activity in a microinjection assay. These data argue for an “enzyme activation” model for Shp2 tyrosyl phosphorylation. Because Shp2 rapidly autodephosphorylates, however, a stable phosphonate might not have the same effect in cells as would a transiently phosphorylated tyrosyl residue. The function of Grb2 binding in the enzyme activation model is also unclear. Most importantly, there has been no clear demonstration that tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shp2 is required for its signaling functions. Several studies have investigated the effects of over-expressing tyrosyl phosphorylation site mutants of Shp2 on RTK signaling in vertebrate systems. Bennett et al. found no effect of such mutants on EGF and PDGF signaling in transiently transfected 293 cells (20Bennett A.M. Hausdorff S.F. O'Reilly A.M. Freeman R.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), nor did these mutants inhibit FGF-induced ERK activation, elongation movements, or mesoderm induction in Xenopus embryos (21O'Reilly A.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Csw also has a tyrosyl phosphorylation site that binds Grb2, and a mutant lacking this site rescues csw mutant embryos when expressed under heat shock promoter control (22Allard J.D. Herbst R. Carroll P.M. Simon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13129-13135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These results argue that the effects (if any) of tyrosyl phosphorylation on Shp2/Csw function can be bypassed, at least at sufficiently high levels of expression. Because all of the above studies used over-expression approaches, a requirement for Shp2 tyrosyl phosphorylation might have been obscured. To clarify the role of tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shp2, we used retroviral gene transduction to reconstitute 3T3-immortalized fibroblasts derived from Shp2 mutant mice (8Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2352-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 23Zhang S.Q. Tsiaras W.G. Araki T. Wen G. Minichiello L. Klein R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4062-4072Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) with wild type (WT) Shp2 and Shp2 mutants lacking either or both tyrosyl phosphorylation sites. This approach allowed us to directly compare the signaling abilities of WT Shp2 and phosphorylation site mutants expressed at comparable levels. Our results show that tyrosyl phosphorylation is, in fact, required for normal levels and kinetics of ERK activation in some (FGF and PDGF) but not all (EGF) signaling pathways in fibroblasts. Our data also confirm our previous report that Tyr-542 is the major Grb2 binding site in tyrosylphosphorylated Shp2 and suggest that, in contrast to the predictions of the adapter model, Grb2 binding is not sufficient to mediate the signaling function of Shp2 in the Ras/ERK pathway. Cell Lines and Culture—3T3-immortalized fibroblasts (Ex3–/–cells) derived from a Shp2 exon 3-deficient mouse (23Zhang S.Q. Tsiaras W.G. Araki T. Wen G. Minichiello L. Klein R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell.

The resulting retroviral vectors were co-transfected with the Ecopack packaging vector (generously provided by Dr. D. G. Gilliland, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA) into 293T cells (26Schwaller J. Frantsve J. Aster J. Williams I.R. Tomasson M.H. Ross T.S. Peeters P. Van Rompaey L. Van Etten R.A. Ilaria Jr., R.

Pools of infected cells were recovered following 1 week of puromycin (2 μg/ml) treatment and used for experiments. For growth factor stimulations, cells were starved for at least 16 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then exposed to EGF (20 ng/ml), IGF-1 (50 ng/ml), FGF (20 ng/ml), or PDGF (20 ng/ml). In some experiments, the Src-selective inhibitor SU6656 (Calbiochem) was added to a final concentration of 1 μm for 1 h before stimulation. Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblotting—Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a buffer containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml antipain, and 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, and the protein concentration of clarified lysates was determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (23Zhang S.Q. Tsiaras W.G. Araki T. Wen G. Minichiello L. Klein R. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell.

The monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY.), and monoclonal anti-Shp2 and anti-Grb2 antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Polyclonal anti-Shp2 and anti-MAPK antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal anti-phospho-MAPK and phospho-SHP-2 (Tyr-542) and (Tyr-580) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, Mass.). All immuno-reagents were used at the concentrations recommended by their manufacturers. MAPK Assays—Cells were lysed in 20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. Clarified lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of polyclonal anti-ERK2 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein A-Sepharose (30 μl) was added, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 30–60 min. Immune complex kinase assays using myelin basic protein as substrate were performed as described previously (28Takahashi-Tezuka M. Yoshida Y. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Yamanaka Y. Nishida K. Nakajima K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4109-4117Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Incorporated 32P was visualized by autoradiography and quantified by using NIH image 1.62. Data were evaluated by factorial analysis of variance and Newman-Keuls multiple range test. To clarify the physiological function of tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shp2, we reconstituted Ex3–/–fibroblasts with WT Shp2, mutants of either (Y542F or Y580F) or both (Y542F,Y580F) tyrosyl phosphorylation sites, or the parental retrovirus as a control (Fig. 1A). All experiments were performed with pools of retrovirally infected cells to average out possible inter-clonal variation. Immunoblot analysis using antibodies directed against the Shp2 C terminus revealed that the levels of expression of the reconstituted WT and mutant Shp2 proteins were comparable in each pool (Fig. 1B), thus enabling direct comparison of their signaling properties. An immunoreactive species smaller than WT Shp2 was also detected in each pool, including cells expressing the parental retrovirus alone. As described previously (8Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2352-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), this truncated Shp2 species arises as a consequence of splicing around the neomycin resistance cassette that was used to replace exon 3. Although the N-terminally truncated protein has markedly increased PTP activity, because of its missing N-terminal SH2 domain it fails to target appropriately and, in all settings tested thus far, behaves as an Shp2 hypomorph (8Saxton T.M.

Because of the key role of Shp2 in RTK-evoked ERK activation, we compared the response of WT and mutant Shp2-reconstituted cells to several growth factors. In WT cells, FGF and PDGF stimulation resulted in strong tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shp2. In contrast, IGF-1 and EGF failed to evoke detectable Shp2 tyrosyl phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). Why stimulation with some but not all RTKs leads to tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shp2 is not known, although this difference may be more apparent than real. When over-expressed in heterologous cells, the insulin receptor can evoke detectable Shp2 tyrosyl phosphorylation (33Stein-Gerlach M. Kharitonenkov A. Vogel W. Ali S. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24635-24637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and EGF-stimulated tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shp2 also has been reported in some cell systems (13Lechleider R.J. Freeman Jr., R.M. Neel B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13434-13438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Vogel W. Ullrich A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1589-1597PubMed Google Scholar). Conceivably, RTK-evoked tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shp2 occurs only when surface expression of the receptor exceeds a certain minimal level. We have not quantified EGF receptor, PDGF receptor, IGF-1 receptor, or FGF receptor surface expression in WT or Shp2 mutant-reconstituted cells. However, we did observe higher and/or more sustained growth factor-evoked ERK activation in cells exposed to saturating levels of FGF or PDGF (which stimulate Shp2 tyrosyl phosphorylation) compared with those treated with saturating levels of EGF or IGF (Fig. 1D). Previous studies have shown that increasing RTK expression levels can prolong the kinetics of ERK activation (34Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 702-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 35Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27665-27670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Although several other explanations remain possible, these data along with reports of EGF- or insulin/IGF1-evoked Shp2 tyrosyl phosphorylation in other cell systems are consistent with the possibility that Shp2 phosphorylation depends on the strength of the RTK signal delivered. Alternatively, the ability of a particular growth factor to evoke Shp2 tyrosyl phosphorylation may depend on the proximity of Shp2 to the activated RTK. Notably, the PDGFR has a direct binding site for Shp2 (36Lechleider R.J. Sugimoto S. Bennett A.M. Kashishian A.S. Cooper J.A. Shoelson S.E. Walsh C.T. Neel B.G. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 6939-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), whereas Shp2 is recruited to the FGF receptor signaling complex via FRS-2, which binds constitutively to the FGF receptor (38Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 39Hadari Y.R. Kouhara H. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3966-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In contrast, Shp2 is recruited to the EGF receptor via Gab1 (40Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), and the insulin/IGF-1 receptors are recruited primarily via members of the IRS family (41Kuhne M.R. Pawson T. Lienhard G.E. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11479-11481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which associate less tightly with the respective activated RTKs. In fibroblasts, Shp2 is required for sustained ERK activation in response to EGF, IGF-1, FGF, and PDGF (8Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4904-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of Shp2 tyrosyl phosphorylation, we monitored ERK activation by phospho-specific antibody immunoblotting in cells expressing WT Shp2 or the phosphorylation site mutants (Fig. 2). As expected, restoring WT Shp2 expression increased ERK activation in response to all growth factors, particularly at later time points, compared with vector control-infected cells (Figs. 2, B–F). Consistent with the absence of tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shp2 in response to EGF stimulation, we found no difference in EGF-evoked ERK activation between WT, Y542F-, or Y580F-expressing cells (Fig. 2A). Mutation of both Tyr-542 and Tyr-580 also had no effect on EGF-evoked ERK activation (data not shown). In contrast, ERK activity induced by FGF (Fig. 2B) or PDGF (Fig. 2C) was decreased in Y542F and Y580F mutant cells compared with WT cells, although it remained higher than that in control (vector alone) cells. ERK activation was decreased even further in cells expressing the double phosphorylation site mutant (Y542F,Y580F) than in single mutant (Y542F or Y580F)-expressing cells, although the Y542F,Y580F mutant retained some ability to restore ERK activation compared with vector control cells (Figs. 2, D and E). Direct assessment of ERK activity by immune complex kinase assays confirmed that, compared with WT-expressing cells, ERK activation in response to FGF or PDGF was impaired in cells expressing phosphorylation site mutants of Shp2 (Fig. 2F). Taken together, these data indicate that tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shp2 enhances its ability to restore normal ERK activation to Shp2-mutant cells, although mutants of Shp2 that are unable to become tyrosyl phosphorylated retain some function. Next, we examined the effect of each Tyr → Phe mutation on total tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shp2 and its association with Grb2 in growth factor-stimulated cells. Interestingly, the truncated mutant Shp2 expressed in Ex3–/–fibroblasts (and all of its derivative lines) retained the ability to undergo tyrosyl phosphorylation in response to PDGF, although to a significantly lesser extent than in WT Shp2-expressing cells (Fig. 3A). These data suggest that, in contrast with a previous report on EGFR signaling (10Shi Z.Q. Yu D.H. Park M. Marshall M. Feng G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1526-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), truncated Shp2 can be recruited to the vicinity of the PDGFR. Thus, the Ex3–/–protein may have some residual signaling potential and, consistent with this notion, we have found that unlike Ex3–/–embryos, which die at embryonic days 8.5–10, totally null Shp2 embryos succumb before embryonic day 6.5. 2W. Yang and B. G. Neel, unpublished data. Surprisingly, however, total tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shp2 in cells expressing either Y542F or Y580F, as measured by immunoblotting with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 (Fig. 3A) or several other anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (data not shown), appeared to be reduced to levels seen in cells expressing only the parental retrovirus (Fig. 3A). Similar results were obtained following stimulation with FGF (Fig. 3B). Even more surprising, although the Y542F mutant lost virtually all Grb2-binding ability, PDGF-evoked Grb2 binding to Shp2 in Y580F-expressing cells was restored to WT levels despite the apparent lack of any Shp2 tyrosyl phosphorylation of this mutant (Fig. 3A). Likewise, the Y580F mutant retained about half the Grb2 binding ability of WT Shp2 in FGF-stimulated cells despite lacking any obvious tyrosyl phosphorylation as detected by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting (Fig. 3B). These results appeared to suggest dissociation between Shp2 tyrosyl phosphorylation (as measured by total anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting) and Grb2 binding. On the other hand, they also suggested that Tyr-542 was required for most of the ability of Grb2 to bind to Shp2 following PDGF or FGF stimulation. These are at least two potential explanations for this apparent paradox. Both tyrosines might be necessary for efficient phosphorylation of Shp2. Alternatively, the anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies used for immunoblotting might not recognize mono-phosphorylated Tyr-542 or Tyr-580 effectively. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used recently developed phospho-specific antibodies that recognize Tyr-542 or Tyr-580 (Figs. 3, C and D). Immunoblotting with Tyr(P)-542-specific antibodies revealed that, following PDGF stimulation, Tyr-542 was phosphorylated to comparable extents in WT and Y580F cells. In contrast, no phosphorylation was detected in Y542F-expressing cells, confirming the specificity of these antibodies for Tyr(P)-542 (Fig. 3C, left panel). Immunoblotting with anti-Tyr(P)-580 revealed no phosphorylation in Y580F cells, as expected. Surprisingly, however, Y542F-expressing cells exhibited an ∼50% decrease in Tyr-580 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C, right panel). These data suggest that Tyr-542 must be phosphorylated to promote efficient Tyr-580 phosphorylation in response to PDGF stimulation. Following PDGF stimulation, the Y542F and Y580F mutants also exhibited increased mobility on SDS-PAGE compared with WT Shp2. Whether this reflects the direct effects of tyrosyl phosphorylation on the mobility of Shp2 in SDS-PAGE or a more indirect consequence of tyrosyl phosphorylation, e.g. on seryl/threonyl phosphorylation of Shp2, remains to be determined. The tyrosyl phosphorylation site mutations had a somewhat different effect on FGF signaling. Whereas mutation of Tyr-580 had no effect on Tyr-542 phosphorylation in PDGF signaling, FGF-evoked phosphorylation of Tyr-542 was reduced by ∼50% in Y580F-expressing cells; note that Y580F and WT Shp2 are expressed at comparable levels in these cells (Fig. 1B and 3D). As in PDGF signaling, however, Tyr-542 phosphorylation also was required for efficient phosphorylation of Tyr-580 (Fig. 3D). Taken together, these data suggest a model in which, in the absence of growth factor stimulation, the C terminus of Shp2 is in a “closed” conformation wherein the tyrosyl phosphorylation sites, Tyr-580 in particular, are relatively inaccessible. Following PDGF stimulation, Tyr-542 probably becomes phosphorylated first and then promotes “opening” of the closed form, permitting efficient phosphorylation of Tyr-580. Consistent with our previous work, but in contrast to the conclusions of others (15Vogel W. Ullrich A. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 1589-1597PubMed Google Scholar, 16Keegan K. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1537-1544PubMed Google Scholar), Tyr-542 must also be the major Grb2 binding site in response to PDGF, because Grb2 binding is essentially normal in Y580F-expressing cells, whereas it is absent in cells expressing Y542F. Tyr-542 phosphorylation probably occurs first in response to FGF stimulation as well; but here, Tyr-580 must also undergo phosphorylation for WT levels of Tyr-542 phosphorylation to be attained. Further studies will be required to determine whether Tyr-580 phosphorylation is required for effective phosphorylation of Tyr-542 by its respective kinase or to stabilize it from dephosphorylation, most likely auto-dephosphorylation (33Stein-Gerlach M. Kharitonenkov A. Vogel W. Ali S. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24635-24637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It also is not clear whether tyrosyl phosphorylation per se evokes the conformational changes proposed above or whether it acts more indirectly, e.g. by promoting seryl/threonyl phosphorylation and/or binding of other proteins. Notably, Shp2 has a proline-rich region between Tyr-542 and Tyr-580 (Fig. 1A); conceivably, phosphorylation of either (or both) of these residues could regulate binding of an SH3 domain-containing protein. Regardless, Tyr-542 is probably the major Grb2 binding site in response to FGF signaling as well, because in Y580F-expressing cells Grb2 binding to Shp2 is reduced in parallel to the reduction in Tyr-542 phosphorylation (Figs. 3, B and D). One potential explanation for the apparently ordered phosphorylation of Tyr-542 and Tyr-580 is that these sites could be the targets of different PTKs. For example, Tyr-542 might be phosphorylated by the RTK itself, whereas Tyr-580 would be phosphorylated by a downstream PTK. Src family kinases (SFKs) are attractive candidates for such downstream PTKs, because they are activated in a variety of RTK signaling pathways (42Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3456) Google Scholar, 43Abram C.L. Courtneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Moreover, Shp2 is tyrosyl phosphorylated in viral Src-transformed cells and also is a good Src substrate in vitro (11Feng G.S. Hui C.C. Pawson T. Science. 1993; 259: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 44Hakak Y. Hsu Y.S. Martin G.S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3164-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To test whether SFKs phosphorylate Shp2 downstream of growth factor receptors, we treated WT Shp2-expressing cells with the Src selective inhibitor SU6656 (45Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). However, there was no effect of this inhibitor on either Tyr-542 or Tyr580 phosphorylation in FGF- or PDGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 4A). As an independent test of the role of SFKs, we compared growth factor-evoked Shp2 phosphorylation in cells lacking Src, Fyn, and Yes (SYF cells) and SYF cells reconstituted with Src (46Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Consistent with the inhibitor studies, there was no difference in phosphorylation of either Tyr-542 or Tyr-580 in SYF and SYF Src cells (Fig. 4B). These data indicate that SFKs are not required for phosphorylation of either Tyr-542 or Tyr-580 in response to FGF or PDGF and suggest that each is a direct target of the FGFR and PDGFR, respectively. We cannot exclude the possible involvement of another downstream PTK in the phosphorylation of either Tyr-542 or Tyr-580. Notably, however, two other types of downstream PTKs, the Abl and Tec family PTKs, typically require SFKs to become activated (47Plattner R. Kadlec L. DeMali K.A. Kazlauskas A. Pendergast A.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2400-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 48Rawlings D.J. Scharenberg A.M. Park H. Wahl M.I. Lin S. Kato R.M. Fluckiger A.C. Witte O.N. Kinet J.P. Science. 1996; 271: 822-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 49Miller A.T. Berg L.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our results also argue strongly against the Grb2 adapter model for positive signaling by Shp2. Although mutation of Tyr-580 results in marked diminution of the ability of Shp2 to restore normal ERK activation in response to PDGFR stimulation (Figs. 2, C and D), Y580F Shp2 retains essentially WT Grb2 binding in PDGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 3A). Likewise, Y580F retains ∼50% Grb2 binding in FGF-stimulated cells. Because heterozygotic Shp2-deficient fibroblasts express about half the level of Shp2 as WT cells yet activate ERK normally in response to FGF (8Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2352-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar),2 the level of Grb2 binding in Y580F cells should have been sufficient to restore Shp2 function if the adapter model was correct. Instead, our results support alternative explanations for the role of tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shp2. Cole and co-workers have provided compelling evidence that tyrosyl phosphorylation of Shp2 can result in increased Shp2 activity (18Lu W. Gong D. Bar-Sagi D. Cole P.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 759-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and increased Shp2 activity might well explain our results. But, in addition to becoming tyrosyl-phosphorylated, Shp2 binds via its SH2 domains to the PDGFR and Gab1 following PDGF stimulation and to Gab1 and FRS2 in response to FGF. Engagement of the N-terminal SH2 domain of Shp2 fully activates the enzyme; therefore, it is unclear how/why tyrosyl phosphorylation would be required to promote additional Shp2 activation. Conceivably, a significant amount of tyrosyl-phosphorylated Shp2 transmits signals while unbound to the above phosphotyrosyl proteins. However, a second alternative is suggested by the role of tyrosyl phosphorylation of the receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase RPTPα. ∼20% of RPTPα is phosphorylated constitutively on Tyr-789 and, like Shp2, tyrosyl-phosphorylated RPTPα binds Grb2 (50den Hertog J. Tracy S. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3020-3032Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 51Su J. Batzer A. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18731-18734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies show that tyrosyl phosphorylation of RPTPα is essential for its major function, the dephosphorylation of inhibitory C-terminal phosphotyrosines of Src family PTKs (SFKs) (52Zheng X.M. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6037-6049Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 53Zheng X.M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Inactive SFKs assume a closed state with their C-terminal phosphotyrosines bound intramolecularly to their respective SH2 domains. Phosphorylated Tyr-789 of RPTPα competes with SFK C-terminal tyrosyl residues for binding to SFK SH2 domains, thereby “prying open” the closed form and facilitating dephosphorylation of SFK C-terminal tyrosyl residues by the RPTPα catalytic domain. Grb2 competes with SFK C-terminal phosphotyrosines for binding to RPTPα Tyr(P)-789; thus, Grb2 functions as an inhibitor of the biological activity of RPTPα. By analogy, tyrosyl-phosphorylated Shp2 might engage the SH2 domain of a potential substrate(s), thereby increasing its accessibility to the PTP domain. If so, then key substrates for Shp2 might be identified by virtue of their ability to bind to phosphotyrosyl peptides derived from the sequences surrounding Tyr-542 and/or Tyr-580. In summary, our studies reveal new complexity in Shp2 regulation and function. We have shown that phosphorylation of the two Shp2 C-terminal tyrosines most likely occurs in an ordered fashion, with Tyr-542 phosphorylation preceding phosphorylation of Tyr-580. Moreover, our results show unambiguously that Tyr-542 is the major Grb2 binding site in Shp2, at least in fibroblasts stimulated with PDGF or FGF. Most importantly, although it is well established that the PTP activity of Shp2 is essential for its positive signaling functions, we have demonstrated for the first time that tyrosyl phosphorylation has an important but more auxiliary role, potentiating the actions of Shp2 in some, but not all, RTK signaling pathways. Further studies will be required to clarify just how tyrosyl phosphorylation regulates Shp2 function."

Sea surface temperature reconstructions show that although some past upwelling events have been stronger, there were no analogous episodes of coral mortality during the past 7000 years, indicating that the 1997 red tide was highly unusual. We show that iron fertilization by the 1997 Indonesian wildfires was sufficient to produce the extraordinary red tide, leading to reef death by asphyxiation.

https://openalex.org/W2026537091,"Atherosclerosis in inbred mouse strains has been widely studied by using an atherogenic (Ath) diet containing cholesterol, cholic acid, and fat, but the effect of these components on gene expression has not been systematically examined. We employed DNA microarrays to interrogate gene expression levels in liver of C57BL/6J mice fed the following five diets: mouse chow, the Ath diet, or modified versions of the Ath diet in which either cholesterol, cholate, or fat were omitted. Dietary cholesterol and cholate produced discrete gene expression patterns. Cholesterol was required for induction of genes involved in acute inflammation, including three genes of the serum amyloid A family, three major histocompatibility class II antigen genes, and various cytokine-related genes.

The mouse has become established as a key animal model for studies of lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis, due to the development of techniques for genetic manipulation and tools for gene discovery in this species (reviewed in Refs. 1Knowles J.W.

The first studies to demonstrate that the mouse might provide a useful model for characterization of genetic factors affecting atherosclerosis susceptibility appeared more than 30 years ago. These studies surveyed several inbred laboratory mouse strains and demonstrated that some strains develop early atheromatous lesions when fed experimental diets. These diets contained high concentrations of cholesterol (5%) and fat (30%) supplemented either with cholic acid (2%) (5Thompson J.S. J. Atheroscler. Res. 1969; 10: 113-122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) or fed in combination with irradiation treatments (6Vesselinovitch D. Wissler R.W. J. Atheroscler. Res. 1968; 8: 497-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These early diets produced high mortality and were subsequently modified to reduce the concentrations of cholesterol (1.25%), fat (15%), and cholate (0.5%). By using this modified atherogenic (Ath) 1The abbreviations used are: Ath, atherogenic diet; LDL/VLDL, low density/very low density lipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; EST, expressed sequence tag; SAA, serum amyloid A; RT, reverse transcriptase. diet, Paigen et al.

The C57BL/6J strain was among the most susceptible and has been extensively used as a model for dietinduced atherosclerosis. Although the Ath diet has been widely used to study atherogenesis in C57BL/6J and other mouse strains, the effects of the individual dietary components have not been well characterized. In susceptible mouse strains, the Ath diet produces an atherogenic lipoprotein profile and induces inflammatory gene expression in the liver. For example, C57BL/6J mice fed the Ath diet exhibit dramatically elevated low density/very low density lipoprotein (LDL/VLDL) and reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (8Paigen B. Mitchell D. Reue K. Morrow A. Lusis A.J. LeBoeuf R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3763-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 9LeBoeuf R.C. Doolittle M.H. Montcalm A. Martin D.C. Reue K. Lusis A.J. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 91-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this strain, the Ath diet also induces inflammatory and oxidative stress genes such as serum amyloid A, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, colony-stimulating factors, and heme oxygenase (10Liao F. Andalibi A. deBeer F.C. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 2572-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). It is unclear at present which component(s) of the atherogenic diet produce the observed effects on lipoproteins and inflammation. Furthermore, previous work (11Nishina P.M. Verstuyft J. Paigen B. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 859-869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Nishina P.M. Lowe S. Verstuyft J. Naggert J.K. Kuypers F.A. Paigen B. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1413-1422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that reduction in the concentration of either cholesterol or cholate in the Ath diet decreases the rate of aortic lesion formation and that the two components differentially affect gallstone formation and lipid accumulation in liver. This suggests that cholesterol and cholate may have independent pro-atherogenic effects. To test this hypothesis, we undertook a systematic analysis of plasma lipid and gene expression changes that occur in response to the cholesterol, cholate, and fat components of the Ath diet. C57BL/6J mice were fed one of five diets: mouse chow, the Ath diet, or modified versions of the Ath diet in which either cholesterol, cholate, or fat were omitted. We examined plasma lipid profiles and used DNA microarrays to screen the response of more than 11,000 mouse genes and expressed sequence tags (ESTs). A comparison of gene expression levels across all five diets allowed the identification of genes that were activated or repressed specifically by dietary cholesterol, cholate, or fat. We identified more than 300 genes that were activated or repressed by one of the three diet components, with more than a quarter of those (89:316) exhibiting at least a 10-fold response to either cholesterol, cholate, or fat. Cholesterol and cholate were found to induce expression of genes involved in different aspects of the inflammatory response, with cholesterol being required for the acute inflammatory response, whereas cholate was responsible for activating genes associated with hepatic fibrosis. Biochemical measurements of representative proteins from the acute inflammatory and fibrotic responses confirmed the gene expression data. We further investigated the potential role of these gene expression changes in atherogenesis by examining their expression in an atherosclerosis-resistant substrain of C57BL/6 mice. The activation of both the inflammatory and fibrotic genes was dramatically attenuated in the resistant mice, suggesting that their response to the Ath diet at the level of gene transcription may be one mechanism contributing to their resistance to diet-induced atherosclerosis. Overall, our results establish that cholesterol and cholate components of the Ath diet have distinct proatherogenic effects on gene expression, which correlate with genetic differences in atherosclerosis susceptibility in two closely related C57BL/6 mouse strains. Mice and Diets—Male C57BL/6J and C57BL/6ByJ mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were fed ad libitum Purina Mouse Chow 5001, or one of four experimental diets (Teklad Research Diets, Madison, WI) containing various combinations of cholesterol, sodium cholate, and fat (in the form of cocoa butter). The Ath diet (Teklad TD90221) contained (by weight) 75% Purina Mouse Chow, 7.5% cocoa butter, 1.25% cholesterol, and 0.5% sodium cholate. The other three diets were equivalent to the Ath diet, with the omission of cholesterol (TD98232), cholate (TD94059), or fat (TD98233). At 3 months of age, mice were housed individually and fed the specified diet for 3 weeks before harvesting tissue and blood. The care of the mice and all procedures used in this study were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health animal care guidelines. Lipid Determinations—Blood was obtained after a 16-h fast. Enzymatic assays for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, unesterified cholesterol, triglyceride, and free fatty acids were performed using enzymatic assays (13Hedrick C.C. Castellani L.W. Warden C.H. Puppione D.L. Lusis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20676-20682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LDL/VLDL cholesterol levels were determined as the difference between total and HDL cholesterol levels. For hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride determinations, lipids were extracted from 100 mg of tissue as described (14Carr T.P. Andresen C.J. Rudel L.L. Clin. Biochem. 1993; 26: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide Microarray Hybridization—Liver samples comprising the identical lobe were harvested from each mouse and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was prepared from mouse liver using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Each microarray hybridization was performed using 10 μg of total liver RNA pooled from four mice. Oligonucleotide microarrays (MU11K) were from Affymetix (Santa Clara, CA) and contained representations of more than 11,000 full-length mouse genes and EST clusters. cRNA synthesis, hybridization, washing, and scanning were performed according to standard Affymetrix protocols. Fluorometric data were generated by Affymetrix software, and the gene chips were globally scaled to all the probe sets with an identical target intensity value. Transformation of the fluorescent signals into numerical values and filtering of the data were accomplished as described (15Kersten S. Mandard S. Escher P. Gonzalez F.J. Tafuri S. Desvergne B. Wahli W. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1971-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Only genes with an absolute expression level (expressed as average difference, or Avg Diff, value from Affymetrix software output) above a threshold of 30 were analyzed. Identification of genes that are activated or repressed by specific diet components was accomplished using Microsoft EXCEL. The full set of microarray data for strains C57BL/6J and C57BL/6ByJ is available in supplemental data online. mRNA Quantitation—Confirmation of mRNA expression differences observed on microarrays was performed by Northern blot and RT-PCR. Total liver RNA was isolated using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from total RNA using the Poly(A)Tract mRNA isolation system (Promega, Madison, WI) and 2 μg loaded per lane for Northern analysis. Hybridizations were performed as described (16Cohen R.D. Castellani L.W. Qiao J.-H. Van Lenten B.J. Lusis A.J. Reue K. J. Clin.

Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 503-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Total RNA was treated with DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX) to remove contaminating genomic DNA, and cDNA was prepared from 2 μg of total liver RNA. 5% of the resulting cDNA sample was amplified for 32 cycles using a Touchdown protocol with a beginning annealing temperature of 63 °C and a final annealing temperature of 53 °C (18Vergnes L. Phan J. Stolz A. Reue K. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 503-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in agarose, and quantitation of digital images was performed using 1D Image Analysis software (Eastman Kodak Co.). Serum Amyloid A and Collagen Quantitation—Serum amyloid A levels in mouse plasma were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA). Collagen concentration in liver was determined using the Sircol collagen assay (Accurate Chemicals, Westbury, NY). Briefly, 50 mg of liver was homogenized, and total acid pepsin-soluble collagens were extracted overnight using 5 mg/ml pepsin in 500 μl of 0.5 m acetic acid. One ml of Sircol dye reagent was added to 100 μl of each sample, in duplicate, and incubated at 25 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, the pellet was suspended in 1 ml of alkali reagent, and absorbance was read at 540 nm. Effects of Ath Diet Components on Circulating Lipid Levels—To investigate the effect of specific components of the Ath diet on circulating lipid levels, C57BL/6J mice were fed a chow diet, the Ath diet, or one of three modified Ath diets in which either cholesterol, cholate, or fat was omitted (Table I). Compared with chow, the Ath diet produced more than a 2-fold increase in plasma cholesterol levels, due to an increase of more than 100 mg/dl in LDL/VLDL cholesterol (Fig. 1), as observed previously (9LeBoeuf R.C. Doolittle M.H. Montcalm A. Martin D.C. Reue K. Lusis A.J. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 91-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to previous reports, HDL cholesterol levels were not significantly reduced on the Ath diet. This may be a result of using male, as opposed to female mice, and/or the shorter (3 week) duration of the diet compared with some previous studies. The amount of unesterified cholesterol more than doubled on the Ath diet, whereas triglyceride levels were reduced ∼50%, and free fatty acid levels were unchanged.Table IComposition of the five dietsChowAthNo cholateNo cholesterolNo fatCholate-+-++Cholesterol-++-+Fat-+++- Open table in a new tab The diets lacking cholesterol, cholate, and fat components each produced distinct plasma lipid profiles (see Fig. 1). The omission of fat from the Ath diet did not alter plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, or fatty acid levels compared with the complete Ath diet, indicating that the fat added to this diet has little effect on the circulating lipid levels. In contrast, omission of cholesterol prevented any significant increase in total cholesterol or unesterified cholesterol above the levels on a chow diet. The cholate-free diet produced elevated cholesterol levels that were intermediate between values on the chow and Ath diets and were significantly higher than the chow values. Although total cholesterol levels were not statistically different between Ath and no cholate diets, the distribution of cholesterol among LDL/VLDL and HDL fractions was dramatically affected by dietary cholate. LDL/VLDL cholesterol increased 10-fold on the Ath diet but only 2-fold on the cholate-free diet, whereas HDL cholesterol was at it highest on the cholate-free diet. The omission of cholesterol from the Ath diet also blunted the increase in LDL/VLDL cholesterol levels seen with the complete diet, indicating that cholesterol and cholate act synergistically to elicit the large increase in LDL/VLDL cholesterol that occurs on the Ath diet. A similar diet effect was observed with hepatic cholesterol levels. Thus, although hepatic cholesterol levels increased 6-fold on the Ath diet, this required the inclusion of both cholesterol and cholate. Triglyceride levels were suppressed about 2-fold on the Ath diet (Fig. 1). Omission of either cholate or cholesterol from the Ath diet produced a significant elevation in triglyceride levels above those seen on either chow or Ath diets, suggesting that the two components act together to effect the reduced triglyceride levels observed with the Ath diet. Hepatic triglyceride levels were also repressed on the Ath diet, but omission of cholate prevented this repression. Free fatty acid levels were not significantly affected by the Ath diet components. Thus, cholesterol and cholate components appear to have both independent effects and synergistic effects on plasma and hepatic lipid levels. Cholesterol and Cholate Induce Distinct Sets of Inflammatory Genes—To investigate gene expression changes underlying the diet-induced alterations in lipid levels, we performed microarray hybridization studies. Liver RNA from mice fed each of the five diets was hybridized to Affymetrix MU11K oligonucleotide microarrays to assess the relative expression levels of thousands of mouse genes and ESTs. Data were filtered to exclude signals below a defined threshold of absolute expression level and to ensure specificity of hybridization for perfect match versus mismatch oligonucleotides (see “Experimental Procedures”) (15Kersten S. Mandard S. Escher P. Gonzalez F.J. Tafuri S. Desvergne B. Wahli W. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1971-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). By using these criteria, 7200 of the 13,104 DNA elements on the array were scored as present in at least one diet sample. Comparison of gene expression profiles for the two most extreme diets, chow and Ath, revealed that the combination of cholesterol, cholate, and fat produces widespread changes in hepatic gene expression levels. 839 genes were activated, and 454 genes were repressed by at least 3-fold on the Ath diet compared with basal levels on the chow diet. A systematic comparison of expression levels among all five diets allowed the identification of genes that are regulated by specific dietary components. Approximately 1.4% of genes represented on the array exhibited altered expression specifically in response to cholesterol, cholate, or fat. By comparing the expression levels of genes across all five diets, we defined six gene expression patterns with respect to regulation by specific diet components: cholesterol-activated, cholesterol-repressed, cholate-activated, cholate-repressed, fat-activated, and fat-repressed. For example, “cholesterol-activated genes” were those having at least 2-fold higher levels on all three diets containing cholesterol (Ath, No Cholate, and No Fat diets) than on the two diets lacking cholesterol (Chow and No Cholesterol diets). Representative expression profiles for each of the six groups are shown in Fig. 2. A full list of genes activated or repressed by cholesterol, cholate, or fat is given in Table II, and a summary of each group is given below.Table IIGenes activated or repressed by cholesterol, cholate, or fat Cholesterol-regulated Genes—Expression of 38 of the genes assayed was altered by the presence of dietary cholesterol, including 25 genes that were activated and 13 repressed by cholesterol (Table II). The magnitude of activation by cholesterol was striking, with 30% of the cholesterol-activated genes showing more than 10-fold induction in response to cholesterol. An example of a cholesterol-activated gene, serum amyloid A3 (Saa3), showed equivalent high levels of expression on the complete Ath diet and the No Fat diet, and lowest levels on the No Cholesterol diet (Fig. 2a). The nearly identical expression levels on the Ath and No Fat diets indicate that fat had little effect on expression of this group of genes and also illustrate the consistency of gene expression measurements across individual microarray hybridizations. Most of these genes had expression levels on the No Cholate diet that were intermediate between those on Ath and the No Cholesterol diets. This suggests that whereas cholesterol has the strongest effect on expression of these genes, cholate plays an additive role with cholesterol to achieve the peak expression levels. Notable among the cholesterol-activated genes were 12 genes known to be involved in acute inflammation and the immune response: genes of the serum amyloid A (SAA) family (Saa2, Saa3, and Saa4), histocompatibility antigens (H2-1A-α, H2-1A-β, H2-1E-β, and Ia-associated invariant chain), and additional inflammation/immune-associated genes including interleukin-2 receptor γ (Il2rg), small inducible cytokine B9 (Scyb9), SAM domain and HD domain 1 (Samhd1), paired-Ig-like receptor A5 (Pira5), and galectin-3 (Lgals3) (Table II). SAA gene expression was induced from 7- to 8-fold (Saa2 and Saa4) to 37-fold (Saa3) on the Ath diet. Whereas omission of cholate from the diet diminished the response, cholesterol was absolutely critical for activation of SAA gene expression (Fig. 2a). Similar cholesterol requirements were observed for the other inflammation-related genes shown in Fig. 2a, although magnitude of expression was lower. Genes that were repressed by dietary cholesterol included aquaporin-8, which has been implicated in canalicular bile secretion in liver (19Huebert R.C. Splinter P.L. Garcia F. Marinelli R.A. LaRusso N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22710-22717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), Cyp17a1, a key enzyme in C-21 steroid biosynthesis, and apolipoprotein A-IV, a component of high density lipoproteins, that has been shown previously (20Baroukh N. Ostos M.A. Vergnes L. Recalde D. Staels B. Fruchart J. Ochoa A. Castro G. Zakin M.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 502: 16-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) to be repressed by the Ath diet. An additional 7 novel ESTs of unknown function were also repressed by cholesterol (for example see Fig. 2b). Cholate-regulated Genes—Of the three Ath diet components examined here, cholate affected expression levels of the greatest number of genes, with 81 genes induced and 23 repressed by cholate (Table II; see examples in Fig. 2, c and d). Most striking was the induction of numerous genes encoding collagen and non-collagen extracellular matrix components. The expression and excretion of extracellular matrix proteins is indicative of fibrogenesis, a wound healing process that occurs in response to inflammation induced by infectious or metabolic agents (21Neubauer K. Saile B. Ramadori G. Can. J. Gastroenterol. 2001; 15: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Five collagen genes were activated up to 70-fold by the Ath diet: Col1a1 and Col1a2 (which encode procollagen, type I, subunits α1 and α2), Col3a1 (procollagen, type III, α1), Col4a1 (procollagen, type IV, α1), Col6a1 (procollagen, type VI, α1), and nidogen (a glycoprotein that binds type IV collagen). Omission of cholesterol from the diet had little effect on collagen gene expression, but omission of cholate prevented induction (Fig. 2c). Additional cholate-activated genes involved in extracellular matrix synthesis included nidogen and lumican, two proteins that have direct interactions with extracellular collagens, as well as vimentin, a cytoskeletal intermediate filament protein, and connective tissue growth factor (Ctgf), which modulates extracellular matrix secretion. Thus, dietary cholate appears to have a specific effect on activation of genes involved in the response to chronic inflammation. Several additional genes induced by cholate have recognized roles in lipid metabolism. For example, cholate induced phospholipid transfer protein (Pltp), which is involved in lipoprotein remodeling and has been shown recently to be regulated by bile acids through the farnesoid X-activated nuclear hormone receptor (22Urizar N.L. Dowhan D.H. Moore D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39313-39317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), Also induced by cholate was liver X receptor β, an oxysterol-binding nuclear hormone receptor that activates several genes involved in cellular cholesterol efflux. Dietary cholate also induced choline kinase and lipocalin 2, genes involved in phospholipid synthesis and intracellular lipid transport, respectively. The list of genes repressed by cholate was less extensive than those activated by this component (Table II). These included chemokine orphan receptor 1, a choline/ethanolamine kinase (Chk1), a gene implicated in very long chain fatty acid elongation (Elovl3), and cytochrome P450, 7b1 (Cyp7b), a key enzyme in the alternate pathway of bile acid synthesis. Fat-regulated Genes—Of the Ath diet components, fat affected expression of the fewest genes, with 6 fat-activated and 9 fat-repressed genes identified by our criteria of at least 2-fold effects in response to fat across all five diets (Table II). The magnitude of expression of most of these genes was quite modest. A notable exception was insulin growth factor-like binding protein-1 (Igfbp1), which was expressed at high levels on the chow and no fat diets, but repressed on all diets containing fat (Fig. 2f). Confirmation of Independent Cholesterol and Cholate Effects on SAA and Fibrogenic Gene Expression—The data above demonstrated that cholesterol was required for the large induction of SAA gene expression, whereas cholate was required for induction of collagen gene expression. To confirm that these gene expression changes resulted in corresponding increases in protein levels, we quantitated SAA protein levels in blood and collagen levels in liver under the various diet conditions. In agreement with the mRNA expression results, SAA protein levels in the circulation increased about 30-fold on Ath compared with a chow diet. The same high SAA levels were present when cholate was omitted from the Ath diet, but omission of cholesterol prevented any increase above chow values (Fig. 3a). Analogously, hepatic collagen levels were elevated specifically in diets containing cholate, regardless of the other components (Fig. 3b). These results establish that the cholesterol- and cholate-specific changes in SAA and collagen gene expression give rise to altered protein levels as well. Additional confirmation that the fibrotic process is activated by dietary cholate was obtained by examining additional markers of fibrotic gene expression. The major source of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins in liver fibrosis is hepatic stellate cells, a population of perisinusoidal cells comprising 15% of the resident liver cells (23Kmiec Z. Adv. Anat. Embryol. Cell Biol. 2001; 161: 1-151Crossref Google Scholar, 24Friedman S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2247-2250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar). Hepatic stellate cells typically exist in a quiescent state, serving as the principal storage site for retinoids. In response to stimuli such as bacterial infection or inflammation, the stellate cells become activated and transform into proliferative, fibrogenic cells. To characterize further the fibrogenic response to dietary cholate, we examined established markers of activated stellate cells via RT-PCR (17Canbay A. Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Taniai M. Sebo T.J. Gores G.J. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 1323-1330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The Ath diet increased expression of several hepatic stellate cell markers including platelet-derived growth factor β-receptor (Pdgfrb), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (Timp1), transforming growth factor β1(Tgfb1) (see Fig. 4), and α-smooth muscle actin (not shown). The induction of hepatic stellate cell genes was attenuated when cholate was omitted from the diet, consistent with the observed induction of collagen and other fibrotic genes specifically by cholate. Attenuated Response to Cholesterol and Cholate in an Atherosclerosis-resistant C57BL/6 Substrain—As described above, the Ath diet induces expression of several inflammatory genes in C57BL/6J mice, primarily through the cholesterol and cholate components. This raises the possibility that induction of these genes contributes to the pro-atherogenic effect of this diet. To address this issue, we investigated whether the same gene expression patterns occur in an atherosclerosis-resistant, but otherwise genetically similar, mouse strain C57BL/6ByJ. C57BL/6ByJ mice were derived from the same original progenitor as C57BL/6J but have been bred independently for many years (25Bailey D.W. Morse H.C.T. Origins of Inbred Mice. Academic Press, New York1978: 197-215Crossref Google Scholar). Although very few DNA polymorphisms have been detected between the two C57BL/6 substrains, the C57BL/6ByJ strain is resistant to hypercholesterolemia and aortic lesion formation in response to the Ath diet (26Mouzeyan A. Choi J.-H. Allayee H. Wang X.W. Sinsheimer J. Phan J. Castellani L.W. Reue K. Lusis A.J. Davis R.C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 573-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether this strain also differs in gene expression response to cholesterol and cholate, C57BL/6ByJ mice were fed the five diets described earlier, and expression levels of inflammatory genes induced by cholesterol and cholate were compared with those seen for C57BL/6J. C57BL/6ByJ mice were found to differ dramatically from C57BL/6J mice in gene expression response to cholesterol. The inflammatory genes activated by cholesterol in C57BL/6J mice were expressed at similar levels on the chow diet but were not induced significantly in C57BL/6ByJ by the Ath diet or other diets (Fig. 5, a and b). Although the SAA genes were induced 7–37-fold in C57BL/6J, Saa2 and Saa4 were induced only 2–3-fold and Saa3 was not induced at all in C57BL/6ByJ. Many other cholesterol-responsive inflammatory genes showed either no induction at all (Scyb9, Samhd1, Pira5, Lgals, and Ly6), or increased expression slightly on cholesterol-containing diets (H2-Aa, H2-Ab1, H2-Ebi, Ii, and Il2rg) (Fig. 5b). The induction of fibrosis-related gene expression in C57BL/6ByJ was also attenuated compared with C57BL/6J, but less dramatically than the cholesterol-responsive genes (Fig. 5, c and d). Although nidogen, lumican, vimentin, and Ctgf were similarly activated by cholate in both strains, most collagen genes were either not activated at all (Col6a1 and Col1a2) or activated at 25–50% the levels seen in C57BL/6J (Col1a1 and Col3a1). Thus, the two C57BL/6 substrains differ substantially in their gene expression response to dietary cholesterol, and C57BL/6ByJ mice also fail to induce collagen family members to the levels seen in C57BL/6J mice in response to cholate. The gene expression differences between C57BL/6J and C57BL/6ByJ in SAA and collagen were confirmed by biochemical measurements. Circulating SAA levels in C57BL/6J mice fed the Ath diet were 5–8-fold higher than in C57BL/6ByJ mice (Fig. 6a). Hepatic collagen levels also remained significantly lower in the C57BL/6ByJ mice in response to the Ath diet (Fig. 6b), consistent with the gene expression data. Thus, the closely related C57BL/6 substrains exhibit clearly different responses to the cholesterol and cholate components of the Ath diet, at both the transcriptional and protein levels. These findings are consistent with the possibility that attenuated inflammatory and fibrotic gene expression contributes to the atherosclerosis resistance in C57BL/6ByJ compared with C57BL/6J mice. The atherogenic diet containing cholesterol, cholate, and fat has been used for more than 25 years by several investigators to study the pathology and genetics of atherosclerosis in inbred mouse strains. Although it has been shown that both cholesterol and cholate are required to produce aortic lesions in susceptible mouse strains in a practical period of time (12Nishina P.M. Lowe S. Verstuyft J. Naggert J.K. Kuypers F.A. Paigen B. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1413-1422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is not clear what effect each component produces. To begin to address this issue, we have used microarrays to quantitate gene expression levels in response to Ath diet components. By comparing expression patterns on the Ath diet with those on diets in which one component was omitted, we identified groups of genes that are activated or repressed specifically by cholesterol, cholate, or fat. Although some genes were regulated by more than one component, many genes were strongly induced or repressed primarily by a single dietary component. Two key groups of genes that are likely to play a role in atherogenesis were found to be induced by the Ath diet: 1) more than 20 genes involved in acute inflammation/immune response, and 2) extracellular matrix proteins, characteristic of hepatic fibrosis in response to chronic injury. Inflammatory gene activation was dependent on the presence of cholesterol in the diet, whereas the collagen gene family members were induced specifically by cholate. These results extend previous observations showing that the Ath diet induces SAA genes in C57BL/6J liver (27Liao F. Andalibi A. Qiao J.H. Allayee H. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1994; 94: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) by demonstrating that activation of SAA and other acute inflammatory genes occurs largely in response to cholesterol. Furthermore, the fact that SAA levels were elevated on the cholate-free diet demonstrates that the dramatic elevation in LDL/VLDL seen on the Ath diet is not required to activate SAA gene expression, nor do elevated HDL levels protect against it (see Fig. 1). Likewise, fibrotic gene expression was induced even when cholesterol was omitted from the Ath diet, indicating that fibrosis is not dependent on elevated plasma or hepatic cholesterol levels (Fig. 1). These results indicate that the cholesterol and cholate components of the Ath diet have distinct proatherogenic effects and suggest a strategy to study the contribution of the acute inflammatory response and fibrogenesis independently through dietary manipulation. To evaluate the potential relationship between the Ath diet-induced expression of inflammatory and fibrogenic genes and susceptibility to atherosclerosis, we compared gene expression in two substrains of C57BL/6 mice, one susceptible and the other resistant to atherosclerosis. We determined previously (26Mouzeyan A. Choi J.-H. Allayee H. Wang X.W. Sinsheimer J. Phan J. Castellani L.W. Reue K. Lusis A.J. Davis R.C. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 573-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that C57BL/6ByJ mice fed the Ath diet maintain lower plasma LDL/VLDL cholesterol levels than C57BL/6J. Here we show that an important consequence of this may be attenuated expression in C57BL/6ByJ of cholesterol-responsive inflammatory genes in the liver, resulting in reduced levels of SAA in the circulation. We also observed reduced collagen gene activation in C57BL/6ByJ. This is intriguing in light of our finding that C57BL/6ByJ mice exhibit increased bile acid excretion compared with C57BL/6J mice (28Phan J. Pesaran T. Davis R.C. Reue K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Thus, reduced bile acid accumulation in B6By mice may protect these animals from fibrosis via reduced bile acid-induced stellate cell activation and/or apoptosis (29Brady L.M. Beno D.W.A. Davis B.H. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 765-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 30Higuchi H. Gores G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G734-G738Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Inhibition of stellate cell activation has been suggested as a strategy for treatment of conditions characterized by hepatic inflammation and fibrosis, including chronic viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and other causes of liver cirrhosis (23Kmiec Z. Adv. Anat. Embryol. Cell Biol. 2001; 161: 1-151Crossref Google Scholar, 31Bissell D.M. J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 1998; 33: 295-302Google Scholar, 32Li D. Friedman S.L. J. Gastroenterol.

(Verh.). 1995; 33: 613-620PubMed Google Scholar). Because C57BL/6ByJ mice are resistant to atherosclerosis and exhibit reduced hepatic fibrosis, they may provide a valuable model to establish whether inhibition of stellate cell activation is a useful strategy for treatment of chronic viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and other causes of liver cirrhosis.

https://openalex.org/W1994133913,"The generation of inorganic phosphate by alkaline phosphatase during osteoblast differentiation represents an important signaling event, although the molecular and cellular consequences are currently undefined. We have previously described osteopontin as a gene regulated by an increase in inorganic phosphate not only in osteoblasts but also in other cell types. We describe here the identification of specific signaling pathways required for the stimulation of osteopontin expression by inorganic phosphate. We have determined that phosphate selectively activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) signaling pathway but does not activate the other mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling proteins, p38, or the c-Jun N-terminal kinase. In addition, our results suggest that cellular exposure to 10 mm inorganic phosphate causes a biphasic ERK1/2 activation. The second ERK1/2 activation is required for osteopontin regulation, whereas the first is not sufficient. Analysis of common protein kinase families has revealed that phosphate-induced osteopontin expression specifically uses a protein kinase C-dependent signaling pathway. In addition, our results suggest that protein kinase C and ERK1/2 are not part of the same pathway but constitute two distinct pathways. Finally, we have determined that the proteasomal activity is required not only for phosphate-induced expression of osteopontin but also for the induction of osteopontin in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate and okadaic acid. The data presented here define for the first time the ability of increased inorganic phosphate to stimulate specific signaling pathways resulting in functionally significant changes in gene expression and identify three important signaling pathways in the regulation of osteopontin.

The data presented here define for the first time the ability of increased inorganic phosphate to stimulate specific signaling pathways resulting in functionally significant changes in gene expression and identify three important signaling pathways in the regulation of osteopontin. The process of osteoblast differentiation requires the integration and coordination of multiple intra- and extracellular signals. Previous analysis of a MC3T3-E1 murine preosteoblast cell line repressed for alkaline phosphatase activity identified inorganic phosphate generated in the medium through the interaction of alkaline phosphatase and β-glycerol phosphate as a potentially important signaling molecule in osteoblast differentiation (1Beck Jr., G.R. Sullivan E.C. Moran E. Zerler B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The importance of inorganic phosphate in the process of osteoblast differentiation, in addition to its presence in hydroxyapatite mineral, Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2, is suggested by changes in bone metabolism both in vitro (2Bingham P.J. Raisz L.G. Calcif. Tissue Res. 1974; 14: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 3Bellows C.G. Heersche J.N. Aubin J.E.

Investig. 1971; 50: 2519-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) in response to changes in inorganic phosphate concentrations. Although these studies, as well as others, identified inorganic phosphate as an important factor in osteoblast differentiation, the mechanisms by which it alters cell function remain relatively unknown. The identification of a discrete set of phosphate-responsive genes, including osteopontin, has begun to shed light on the molecular and cellular consequences of increased inorganic phosphate (5Beck Jr., G.R. Zerler B. Moran E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8352-8357Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 6Beck Jr., G.R. Moran E. Knecht N. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 288: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The ability of the phosphate transport inhibitor foscarnet to block phosphate-induced osteopontin expression suggests that phosphate must enter the cell to alter cell function and supports the idea that inorganic phosphate represents a novel and important intracellular signaling molecule in osteoblast differentiation. Although our initial studies determined that inorganic phosphate must enter the cell to alter transcription, little is known about how it ultimately results in regulated gene expression. Inorganic phosphate enters the cell membrane through a family of sodium-dependent transporters (7Kavanaugh M.P. Kabat D.

Upon entering the cell, inorganic phosphate, in addition to regulating osteopontin, has also been demonstrated to alter the cellular localization of the important osteoblast transcription factor Cbfa1 (21Fujita T.

Recently, studies have suggested that inorganic phosphate does not act by sequestering either extracellular or intracellular calcium (6Beck Jr., G.R. Moran E. Knecht N. Exp.

Osteopontin is a highly phosphorylated and glycosylated protein secreted to the extracellular matrix by a variety of cell types. Numerous functions have been ascribed to osteopontin, including roles in bone remodeling; cell-mediated immunity; the ability to act as cytokine in cell signaling, resulting in proliferation and/or cell survival; and as a cell attachment protein (24Denhardt D.T. Giachelli C.M. Rittling S.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 723-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Increased levels of osteopontin protein have been linked to many disease states, including atherosclerosis, transformation, metastasis (24Denhardt D.T. Giachelli C.M. Rittling S.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 723-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 25Furger K.A. Menon R.K. Tuckl A.B. Bramwelll V.H. Chambers A.F. Curr. Mol.

Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 1645-1657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Although intensely studied, the regulation and role of osteopontin in these diseases is not fully understood. In addition, the upstream events regulating osteopontin expression in response to varied signals and disease states are also not well characterized. The potential importance of understanding the signaling pathways used by inorganic phosphate in conjunction with determining the upstream regulation of osteopontin led us to investigate the pathway(s) by which elevated levels of inorganic phosphate regulate osteopontin expression. We describe here a systematic evaluation of many of the major signaling pathways with the goal of identifying required signaling molecules in the up-regulation of osteopontin by inorganic phosphate. Analysis of the mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; PKC, protein kinase c; OPN, osteopontin; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; PKA, protein kinase A; TPA, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; MG-132, N-benzoyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-leucinal; HMGA2, high mobility group A2. ERK1/2, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1/2) reveals that ERK1/2 is specifically required for osteopontin expression in response to elevated phosphate. In addition, we demonstrate that phosphate causes a biphasic phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Analysis of protein kinase signaling molecules reveals that protein kinase c (PKC) is also required in the phosphate-signaling pathway. Finally, we determine that proteasomal activity is required for increased osteopontin expression, not only in response to elevated phosphate but also in response to other regulators of osteopontin, including the tumor promoters okadaic acid and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). The requirement of proteasome activity for osteopontin expression represents a novel and potentially globally important pathway in the regulation of this gene and also identifies a possible target in the modulation of osteopontin in various disease states. These data not only provide insights into the regulation of osteopontin but also identify key signaling cascades initiated by an increase in intracellular inorganic phosphate.

We hypothesized that the up-regulation of osteopontin mRNA expression that occurs in response to elevated inorganic phosphate requires specific signaling pathways. Previous findings established that phosphate must enter the cell through a sodium-dependent transporter to induce osteopontin expression (5Beck Jr., G.R. Zerler B. Moran E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8352-8357Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Because many stimuli use pathways that include one or more members of the MAPK family, we first examined ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 for possible roles in phosphate regulation of osteopontin. MC3T3-E1 cells were pretreated with the indicated inhibitor for 30 min followed by 24 h of treatment with either 10 mm sulfate (control) or phosphate, and the samples were analyzed by Northern blotting. Pretreatment with the ERK1/2-specific MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 (30 μm) (28Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F.

Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3956) Google Scholar), inhibited the induction of osteopontin in response to inorganic phosphate (Fig. 1A). The inactive form of the compound, U0124 (30 μm), had no effect on phosphate-induced osteopontin expression. Treatment with two specific p38 inhibitors, SB202190 and SB203580 (29Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3956) Google Scholar), at 30 μm had little effect on the up-regulation of osteopontin by phosphate. A selective inhibitor of JNK 1/2/3 at doses up to 10 μm (30Wang X. Tokuda H. Hirade K. Kozawa O. J. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 87: 417-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the highest dose the cells would tolerate for 24 h, did not inhibit the phosphate up-regulation of osteopontin (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the inhibition of osteopontin by U0126 is dose-dependent, MC3T3-E1 cells were treated as described above and Northern analysis was performed. The data indicate that pretreatment with U0126 at 10 μm resulted in a decrease of approximately 50% in osteopontin expression in response to phosphate (Fig. 1B), whereas 30 μm resulted in complete inhibition. A concentration of 3 μm resulted in no inhibition (data not shown). The inactive form of the compound, U0124, was again used as a control and showed no inhibition. These results reveal that the up-regulation of osteopontin in response to elevated inorganic phosphate is dose-dependently inhibited by the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 and suggest that activation of the ERK1/2 MAP kinase signaling pathway is required. Phosphate Causes a Biphasic Activation of ERK1/2—The ability of the MEK1/2 inhibitor to block up-regulation of osteopontin in response to inorganic phosphate suggests that elevated inorganic phosphate results in the phosphorylation and hence activation of ERK1/2. To test this hypothesis, MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with 10 mm phosphate for the indicated times (Fig. 2) and harvested for Western analysis. Equal amounts of protein were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. Use of a phospho-specific antibody demonstrated that treatment with phosphate resulted in a biphasic activation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 2A). The activation was initiated within the first 15 min and returned to basal levels by 2 h. A second, more sustained period of activation occurred starting at 8 to 12 h and continued at least through 32 h. An antibody to non-phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 was used to demonstrate equal protein loading. Evaluation of the time course for osteopontin protein levels revealed a detectable increase in osteopontin protein that follows the second increase in ERK1/2, starting at ∼12 h. These results reveal that increased levels of inorganic phosphate lead to phosphorylation and activation of the ERK1/2 signaling proteins and that this pathway is required for phosphate-induced osteopontin RNA and protein (Figs. 1 and 2A). We have demonstrated previously that the concentration of inorganic phosphate required to up-regulate osteopontin expression was inversely proportional to the amount of time the cells were exposed to elevated phosphate (6Beck Jr., G.R. Moran E. Knecht N. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 288: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The results discussed thus far describe the response to 10 mm phosphate. To determine whether the inverse relationship between time and dose holds true for ERK1/2 activation, a time-course experiment was performed in response to treatment with 4 mm inorganic phosphate (Fig. 2B). The results suggest that 4 mm inorganic phosphate requires ∼2 days for the first ERK1/2 phosphorylation, with the second peak occurring at ∼4 days. The up-regulation of osteopontin again follows the second ERK1/2 phosphorylation and is detectable at 5 days. These results agree with the inverse dose/time relationship identified by Northern analysis (6Beck Jr., G.R. Moran E. Knecht N. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 288: 288-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and suggest that the same events that occur after treatment with 10 mm inorganic phosphate for 24 h also occur in response to lower concentrations of phosphate at longer time points. Phosphate Stimulation of ERK1/2 Is Specific—Our initial analysis using inhibitors of the traditional MAPK signaling proteins suggested that neither p38 nor JNK was required in the regulation of osteopontin by phosphate. It is possible that these signaling proteins were activated by phosphate but not required for osteopontin expression. To determine whether these signaling proteins were activated by phosphate, or whether phosphate specifically activated ERK1/2, MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with phosphate for the indicated times (Fig. 3). One sample was additionally treated with 2.5 μg/ml anisomycin, a known activator of both p38 and JNK, for 30 min as a control. Western analysis using phospho-specific antibodies to p38 and JNK revealed no detectable phosphorylation of either p38 or JNK in response to phosphate at any time point analyzed (Fig. 3A). However, these proteins were phosphorylated in response to anisomycin, as determined by the positive response to phospho-specific antibodies. Antibodies to the nonphosphorylated forms of p38 and JNK demonstrated that there are ample amounts of these proteins in MC3T3-E1 cells. These results suggest that although the MAP kinases p38 and JNK are abundantly expressed and capable of activation in these cells, inorganic phosphate specifically stimulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation. To further test the specificity of the MEK1/2 inhibitor, MC3T3-E1 cells were pretreated with 30 μm U0126 for 30 min followed by treatment with either 10 mm inorganic phosphate or 2.5 μg/ml anisomycin for 30 min. The resulting protein samples were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 3B). Treatment with 10 mm phosphate resulted in an increase in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 that was completely inhibited by pretreatment with U0126. Elevated inorganic phosphate did not cause detectable phosphorylation of either p38 or JNK with the antibodies used; however, treatment with anisomycin resulted in phosphorylation of both p38 and JNK. Pretreatment with U0126 did not block phosphorylation of either protein in response to anisomycin, suggesting specificity of this compound for the ERK1/2 signaling pathway. The First ERK1/2 Activation Is Not Sufficient and the Second Activation Is Required—To determine whether one or both peaks of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (activation) are required for osteopontin expression, we again used Northern analysis. MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with 10 mm phosphate followed by treatment with 30 μm U0126 at the indicated times (Fig. 4) after phosphate treatment and all samples were harvested at 24 h (Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, addition of U0126 at 4 and 8 h after phosphate treatment, well after the first peak of ERK1/2 phosphorylation (1 h), resulted in essentially complete inhibition of osteopontin expression, whereas addition of U0126 at 16 h after phosphate treatment resulted in no inhibition of osteopontin expression. Addition of U0126 at 12 h caused a partial inhibition of osteopontin (data not shown). The ability of U0126 to inhibit osteopontin expression after the first ERK1/2 activation peak has occurred suggests that the first peak alone is not sufficient to regulate osteopontin expression and that the second peak of ERK1/2 activation at 8 to 12 h after phosphate treatment is required for induction of osteopontin expression. This does not rule out the requirement of the first peak but does suggest that it is insufficient. We confirmed these results using a different approach. MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with 10 mm inorganic phosphate for the indicated times “pulsed” (Fig. 4), followed by replacement of the phosphate-containing medium with normal growth medium. All samples were harvested at 24 h from the initial phosphate treatment and used for Northern analysis. The results (Fig. 4B) demonstrate that neither the pulse at 3 h nor the pulse at 6 h shows an increase in osteopontin expression, whereas the pulses at both the 9 and 12 h show a clear increase in expression. As a control, the medium was changed on a corresponding 12 h sample without phosphate treatment (–) and showed no increase in osteopontin, confirming that the change in medium itself was not the cause of increased osteopontin expression. The timing of osteopontin regulation in these two experiments corresponds to the timing of the second ERK1/2 activation in Fig. 2A and supports the idea that at least 8 to 12 h of exposure to 10 mm phosphate is required for increased osteopontin expression. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the first ERK1/2 peak demonstrated in Fig. 2A is insufficient to cause the increase in osteopontin expression and that the second ERK1/2 activation peak is required. It should be pointed out that this does not rule out the requirement of the first peak but does establish that it is insufficient. Phosphate-induced OPN Expression Is PKC-dependent—The availability of numerous and relatively specific PKC inhibitors allows for the determination of the requirement of this family in signal transduction events. Although these inhibitors can reveal the requirement of the family as a whole, their use becomes somewhat more controversial in determining the exact family member required. We used two different relatively broad-spectrum PKC inhibitors, calphostin C (31Kobayashi E. Nakano H. Morimoto M. Tamaoki T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 32Tamaoki T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 33Tokuda H. Kozawa O. Niwa M.

The PHO84 gene encodes a high affinity inorganic phosphate transporter, and we find that its disruption results in a manganese-resistant phenotype. Resistance to zinc, cobalt, and copper ions was also demonstrated for pho84Δ yeast. When challenged with high concentrations of metals, pho84Δ yeast have reduced metal ion accumulation, suggesting that resistance is due to reduced uptake of metal ions. Pho84p accounted for virtually all the manganese accumulated under metal surplus conditions, demonstrating that this transporter is the major source of excess manganese accumulation. The manganese taken in via Pho84p is indeed biologically active and can not only cause toxicity but can also be incorporated into manganese-requiring enzymes. Pho84p is essential for activating manganese enzymes in smf2Δ mutants that rely on low affinity manganese transport systems. A role for Pho84p in manganese accumulation was also identified in a standard laboratory growth medium when high affinity manganese uptake is active. Under these conditions, cells lacking both Pho84p and the high affinity Smf1p transporter accumulated low levels of manganese, although there was no major effect on activity of manganese-requiring enzymes.

Excessive accumulation of manganese can interfere with calcium metabolism (11Oehme F.W. Oehme F.W. Toxicity of Heavy Metals in the Environment. Vol. 2. Marcel Dekker, New York and Basel1978: 547-616Google Scholar) and increase errors during replication of mitochondrial DNA (12Putrament A. Baranowska H. Prazmo W. Mol. Gen.

In humans manganese is a potent neurotoxin, and industrial uses of manganese have led to cases of “manganism,” which is characterized by disturbances in mental processes and symptoms similar to those of Parkinson's disease (14Pal P.K. Samii A. Calne D.B. Neurotoxicology. 1999; 20: 227-238PubMed Google Scholar, 15Finley J.W. Davis C.D. Biofactors. 1999; 10: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 16Kaiser J.

The bakers' yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has served as an excellent model system in which to study the homeostasis of manganese. Two of the manganese transporters identified in this organism are Smf1p and Smf2p (17West A.H. Clark D.J. Martin J. Neupert W. Hart F.U. Horwich A.L. J. Biol.

Smf1p is localized to the plasma membrane when manganese is limiting (21Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4863-4868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and has the capacity for high affinity uptake of manganese (22Supek F. Supekova L. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5105-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, when cells are not starved for manganese, as is the case in standard laboratory growth medium, Smf1p does not appear to be essential for manganese accumulation. In smf1Δ cells lacking this transporter there is no major deficiency in the uptake of manganese, and the activity of manganese-requiring enzymes is not significantly decreased, indicating that other cell surface manganese transporters must be active (23Luk E.

The other Nramp manganese transporter of S. cerevisiae, Smf2p, does not directly function in the uptake of extracellular manganese but is localized to intracellular vesicles (19Portnoy M.E. Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7893-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and appears to function in the distribution of manganese within the cell (23Luk E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Yeast lacking SMF2 display a severe reduction in whole cell manganese and activity of manganese-requiring enzymes. The reduction in whole cell manganese of smf2Δ mutants has been proposed to result from a feedback inhibition of cell surface manganese uptake (23Luk E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A separate set of manganese transporter(s) may become active when cells accumulate elevated or toxic levels of the metal (“manganese surplus” state). This is certainly the case for zinc, copper, and iron uptake in yeast. Although high affinity transporters contribute to zinc, copper, and iron uptake when these metals are present at moderate levels (24Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 25Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol.

Science. 1996; 271: 1552-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar), upon exposure to elevated concentrations of these metals the low affinity transporter(s) become the primary source of metal for the cell (27Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 28Dix D. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol.

J. 2000; 351: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the current study we provide evidence that the apparent low affinity uptake of manganese in yeast is accomplished by the action of Pho84p, a cell surface transporter of phosphate (31Bun-Ya M. Nishimura M. Harashima S. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3229-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 32Petersson J. Pattison J. Kruckeberg A.L. Berden J.A. Persson B.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Yeast lacking PHO84 are resistant to high concentrations of manganese and have altered metal ion accumulation. Our results indicate that Pho84p works with the high affinity transporter Smf1p to help maintain cellular manganese levels. This is the first example of an eukaryotic phosphate transporter functioning in metal ion transport. Strains, Culture Conditions, and Plasmids—Strains used in this study were derived from either BY4741 (Mat a, leu2Δ0, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0, his3Δ1) or AA255 (Mat a, ade2, his3Δ200, leu2–3112, lys2Δ201, ura3–52). Yeast strains containing single deletions in PHO84, PHO87, PHO88, PHO89, PHO90, and PHO91 were derived from BY4741 and purchased from Research Genetics. Strains XL112 (smf1Δ), XL117 (smf2Δ), and XL131 (smf1Δ smf2Δ) were derived from AA255 and described previously (19Portnoy M.E. Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7893-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Disruptions of PHO84 in strains AA255, XL112, and XL117 were generated with plasmid pLJ246, resulting in strains LJ328 (pho84Δ), LJ329 (pho84Δ smf1Δ), and LJ330 (smf2Δ pho84Δ); gene deletions were verified by in vivo PCR. Yeast transformations were performed using the lithium acetate procedure (33Gietz R.D. Schiestl R.H. Yeast. 1991; 7: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Cells were propagated without shaking at 30 °C either in an enriched yeast extract, peptone-based medium supplemented with 2% dextrose (YPD) 1The abbreviations used are: YPD, yeast extract, peptone, and dextrose; YPLG, yeast extract, peptone, lactate, and glucose. or in minimal synthetic dextrose medium (34Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1978Google Scholar). Cultures for invertase activity assays were grown in a yeast extract, peptone-based medium with 2% lactate, and 0.1% glucose (YPLG). The PHO84 disruption plasmid was generated by PCR amplifying the upstream (from –837 to –15) and downstream sequences (from 2008 to 2672) introducing BamHI and NotI or XhoI and BamHI sites, respectively. The PHO84 PCR products were digested with the indicated enzymes and ligated in a trimolecular reaction into pRS305 (LEU2) digested with XhoI and NotI, resulting in pLJ246. Transformation of yeast strains with pLJ246 digested with BamHI resulted in deletion of PHO84 sequences from –14 to 2007. Metal Measurements—Yeast cells were grown to an A 600 of 2 in YPD medium or the same medium supplemented with the indicated metal ions. The cultures were harvested and washed with TE (10 mm Tris-Cl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8), then deionized water, and resuspended in deionized water as described (35Jensen L. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3918-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Metal analysis of whole yeast cells was carried out on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences AAnalyst 600 graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer according to the manufacturer's specifications. Biochemical Assays—Superoxide dismutase enzymatic activity was assayed in cells grown in YPD medium to an A 600 of 2. For invertase activity gels, cells were grown in YPD to an A 600 of 1, washed with deionized water, resuspended in YPLG medium at an A 600 of 0.3, and grown for 5 h. To prepare cell lysates for electrophoresis on both denaturing and non-denaturing gels, cells were harvested, and spheroplasts were generated as described previously (35Jensen L. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3918-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Spheroplasts were lysed with 30 strokes of a microcentrifuge tube pestle in 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5, containing protease inhibitors. Extracts were filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane, and protein content was quantitated by the method of Bradford (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). Analysis of superoxide dismutase activity by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis and staining with nitro blue tetrazolium and immunoblot analysis of Sod2p levels were performed as described previously (23Luk E.

Methods in Enzymology: Oxygen Radicals in Biological Systems. Vol. 105. Academic Press, New York1984: 93-104Google Scholar). Invertase activity gels were analyzed by non-denaturing gel electrophoresis and staining with tetrazolium red as described previously (23Luk E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 38Gabriel O. Wong S.F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Disruption of PHO84 but Not Other Phosphate Transporters Genes Causes Resistance to Manganese—Through an analysis of the Research Genetics collection of yeast deletion mutants, we noted that yeast lacking PHO84 were resistant to high concentrations of manganese. PHO84 encodes an inorganic phosphate transporter that localizes to the cell surface of S. cerevisiae and appears to be a major source of cellular phosphate (31Bun-Ya M. Nishimura M. Harashima S. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3229-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 32Petersson J. Pattison J. Kruckeberg A.L. Berden J.A. Persson B.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, pho84Δ mutants are viable because these mutants can obtain phosphate from other transporters. S. cerevisiae is known to express at least six phosphate transporters that contribute to cellular phosphate under various conditions (39Wykoff D.D. O'Shea E.K. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether manganese resistance was associated with the deletion of other phosphate transporters, we tested all six corresponding mutants in a manganese toxicity growth test. As seen in Fig. 1, of the six potential phosphate transporters only disruption of PHO84 resulted in increased resistance to manganese. The identical manganese-resistant phenotype of the pho84Δ strain was observed in two independent genetic backgrounds, i.e. the wild type strain used in the Research Genetics collection (BY4741) (Fig. 1) and an unrelated wild type strain AA255 (not shown). This confirmed that the manganese resistance was in fact due to loss of PHO84. Yeast Lacking PHO84 Are Resistant to Other Metal Ions—We tested whether pho84Δ cells were resistant to other metal ions. As seen in Fig. 2, deletion of PHO84 was not specific to manganese and conferred resistance to zinc and cobalt and a slight resistance to copper. As one possible explanation for the metal resistance, pho84Δ mutants might accumulate lowered concentrations of these metals. We therefore monitored the total cellular concentration of manganese, zinc, cobalt, and copper in cells grown under conditions of moderate metal exposure (e.g. standard laboratory YPD growth medium not supplemented with metals) or exposed to concentrations of these metals that inhibited wild type cell growth by ≈50% (e.g. metal surplus conditions). When grown in a standard laboratory medium without metal supplementation, the cellular levels of zinc and copper were not affected by disruption of PHO84; however, we did observe nearly a 2-fold decrease in manganese and a 4-fold decrease in cobalt levels in the pho84Δ strain relative to wild type (Fig. 3A). Under metal surplus conditions, accumulations of manganese, zinc, cobalt, and copper in the pho84Δ strain were all reduced compared with the wild type (Fig. 3B). The largest effect was observed with manganese in which an 80-fold decrease in metal accumulation was obtained with pho84Δ mutants. Metal accumulation was down 4- to 5-fold for both zinc and cobalt in the pho84Δ strain, and copper showed the smallest difference with a ∼2-fold decrease in pho84Δ yeast. These results indicate that reduced metal accumulation and presumably reduced metal ion uptake is the mechanism of metal ion resistance in pho84Δ yeast. However, Pho84p may also be contributing to the accumulation of manganese and cobalt in a standard laboratory medium in which these metals are present at moderate concentrations.Fig. 3Metal accumulation in pho84 Δ yeast under moderate and surplus metal conditions. Strains AA255 (WT) and LJ328 (pho84Δ) were grown to mid-log phase in YPD medium (A) or the same medium supplemented with 100 μm MnCl2, 750 μm ZnCl2, 250 μm CoSO4, or 2 mm CuSO4 (B) (concentrations of metal that inhibit wild type cell growth by 50%; data not shown), and whole cell metal content was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. The data (± S.D.) are from at least two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PHO84 Is Responsible for Increased Manganese Accumulation When Cells Are Exposed to Elevated Concentrations of the Metal—Using wild type and pho84Δ strains, we sought to determine at what concentration of manganese in the growth medium does Pho84p contribute to manganese accumulation. Both strains were grown in YPD medium containing increasing concentrations of MnCl2, and whole cell manganese was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The steady state accumulation of manganese under these conditions is shown in Fig. 4. Interestingly, intracellular manganese remained relatively constant until the medium manganese concentration reached ≈5 μm. At this manganese concentration a manganese surplus state ensued in which the wild type strain began to accumulate excess manganese at a level that was proportional to the level of extracellular metal. This increase in cellular manganese was PHO84-dependent, as manganese levels in the pho84Δ strain were unchanged with concentrations of up to 25 μm MnCl2 (Fig. 4). The results clearly show that, under conditions of manganese surplus, virtually all the over-accumulation of manganese is dependent on PHO84. PHO84 and SMF1 Both Contribute to Manganese Acquisition—To date, the only reported high affinity manganese transporter at the cell surface in yeast is Smf1p (22Supek F. Supekova L. Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5105-5110Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). However, yeast lacking SMF1 only displays a mild reduction in manganese accumulation and does not display symptoms of manganese starvation such as lowered activity in the manganese-containing enzymes Mn-Sod2p and the manganese-requiring mannosyltransferases (23Luk E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Clearly other routes of manganese acquisition are present beyond this high affinity transporter. To test the role of Pho84p in these other pathways of manganese acquisition, we created a strain lacking both SMF1 and PHO84. Under standard laboratory conditions (YPD medium not supplemented with manganese), a single disruptant of either SMF1 or PHO84 was associated with similar reductions in manganese content (≈30 or ≈40% decrease, respectively). Disruption of both SMF1 and PHO84 was found to be additive and further decreased manganese accumulation ≈80% compared with wild type (Fig 5A). This additivity demonstrates that Smf1p and Pho84p are functioning in separate pathways for the accumulation of manganese. The in vivo manganese status of cells grown under standard laboratory conditions was monitored using the activity of two distinct manganese-requiring enzymes, namely Mn-Sod2p in the mitochondria and mannosyltransferases in the Golgi. The activity of manganese-dependent mannosyltransferases was measured indirectly by observing the level of invertase glycosylation, which can be measured by electrophoretic shifts on non-denaturing gels (38Gabriel O. Wong S.F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). For example, smf2Δ mutants, which accumulate very low levels of manganese, show an increased mobility of invertase, indicative of poor glycosylation (Fig. 5C) and (23Luk E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). We noted that even with the dramatic decrease in manganese content, the smf1Δ pho84Δ strain did not exhibit symptoms of manganese starvation. As is seen in Fig. 5, B and C, smf1Δ pho84Δ cells grown in a standard laboratory medium contained near wild type levels of Mn-Sod2p activity, and the ability of mannosyltransferases to modify invertase was not impaired. In fact, invertase from cells disrupted for PHO84 showed slower mobility, indicating that invertase from these strains was modified to a somewhat greater extent than that from the wild type sample; however, the cause of this mobility difference is not clear. Therefore, even though the smf1Δ pho84Δ strains accumulate low levels of manganese in standard laboratory medium, there is no obvious impairment in the delivery of manganese to enzymes in the mitochondria or the Golgi. By comparison, smf2Δ strains. which also accumulate low manganese, exhibit a noticeable deficiency in manganese-requiring enzymes (Fig. 5, B and C) and (23Luk E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although the rationale for this difference is unknown, it may reflect differential compartmentalization and availability of the manganese in the two types of mutants. Rescue of Mn-Sod2p Activity by Manganese Is Impaired in smf2Δ pho84Δ Yeast—The aforementioned experiments demonstrate that Pho84p is not critical for activation of manganese enzymes in a standard laboratory medium when high affinity manganese uptake systems are operative. However, the situation may be different when cells rely on more low affinity transport systems for manganese acquisition (e.g. manganese surplus conditions). Low affinity transport systems are certainly important in the case of smf2 mutants of yeast, as these cells show severe symptoms of manganese starvation unless the medium is supplemented with elevated manganese (23Luk E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The addition of excess manganese to the growth medium, in this case 5–25 μm manganese, corrects the smf2Δ defect and completely restores the activity of Mn-Sod2p (Fig. 6A). Whole cell manganese content was also returned to wild type levels in the smf2Δ strain with the addition of 5 μm manganese, and excess manganese accumulation was observed upon exposure to higher manganese concentrations (Fig. 6B). This important low affinity pathway does not involve Smf1p, because deletion of SMF1 did not block the rescue of the manganese starvation phenotype by excess manganese in smf2Δ yeast (Fig. 6A, right panel). Thus, this manganese uptake must be occurring through an alternative manganese transporter, perhaps Pho84p. To determine whether this was the case, a strain containing a double disruption of SMF2 and PHO84 was generated. Measuring Mn-Sod2p activity and whole cell manganese content of smf2Δ pho84Δ yeast revealed that PHO84 is critical in alleviation of the manganese starvation phenotype when excess manganese is added to the growth medium (Fig. 6A). Whereas smf2Δ cells require the addition of 5 μm MnCl2 to restore activity of Mn-Sod2p, yeast containing double disruptions of SMF2 and PHO84 require 50 μm MnCl2 to achieve similar levels of Sod2p activity. Even with 50 μm manganese added, the whole cell manganese content of smf2Δ pho84Δ is still only ∼60% that of untreated wild type yeast (Fig. 6B). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that Pho84p is a major component of the low affinity manganese transport system. This manganese taken up via Pho84p is indeed biologically active. The metal not only contributes to cell toxicity but can enter manganese utilization pathways and be incorporated into manganese-requiring enzymes such as Sod2p. The results presented here provide strong evidence that PHO84 encoding an inorganic phosphate transporter also has a role in metal ion transport. Unlike dedicated metal transporters whose activity is tightly regulated by metal concentration (21Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), the uptake of excess metals by Pho84p appears to escape this regulation, perhaps because of its primary function in phosphate transport. As we observed, even in the presence of toxic concentrations of metal ions, PHO84-dependent metal transport continues. Disruption of PHO84 has the strongest effect on manganese accumulation under conditions of manganese surplus, and Pho84p appears to be the primary low affinity transporter of manganese. We find that the manganese transported by Pho84p is biologically active and can both cause toxicity and be incorporated into manganese-requiring enzymes. The intracellular manganese content of yeast is remarkably constant over a certain range of extracellular manganese levels, e.g. up to 5 μm in the case of enriched YPD medium. This buffering of intracellular manganese levels is likely maintained, at least in part, through the action of Pmr1p, a manganese-transporting P-type ATPase (44Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) that facilitates manganese export from the cell through the secretory pathway (45Durr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K.

It seems that when the external manganese concentration reaches a certain threshold (e.g. 5 μm in YPD medium), Pho84p becomes effective in causing manganese accumulation, and the export of manganese through Pmr1p is not sufficient to offset the Pho84p-transported manganese. We suggest that Smf1p and Pho84p together comprise a manganese uptake system that functions over a wide array of external metal concentrations. This is similar to what has been described for the metal transport systems for iron, copper, and zinc, which contain both high (24Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 25Dancis A. Haile D. Yuan D.S. Klausner R.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 28Dix D. Bridgham J.T. Broderius M.A. Byersdorfer C.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol.

Although Pho84p seems to function primarily under manganese surplus or low affinity conditions, our results indicate that PHO84 as well as SMF1 contribute to the acquisition of manganese under conditions of moderate metal exposure (e.g. growth in a standard laboratory medium). Yeast lacking both SMF1 and PHO84 accumulated low levels of manganese, although no major effect on activity of manganese-requiring enzymes was observed in a standard laboratory medium. Our results suggest that under standard conditions the transport of cobalt is also reduced in pho84Δ yeast, indicating that, like manganese, Pho84p contributes to cobalt accumulation under a wide range of environmental metal concentrations. Yet, this is not the case for all metals, because with copper and zinc the pho84Δ mutations only affected uptake with metal surplus and not under standard laboratory conditions. The different levels of PHO84-dependent metal accumulation observed with manganese, cobalt, zinc, and copper may be the result of metal availability in the medium or the competing influence of other specific transporters for these metals. Presumably, Pho84p is co-transporting divalent metal ions and phosphate in vivo in the form of metal-phosphate complexes. Evidence for such a transport mechanism has come from studies of recombinant Pho84p in reconstituted proteoliposomes (47Fristedt U. van der Rest M. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Persson B.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16010-16015Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Recombinant Pho84p was found to require the presence of metal ions such as manganese and cobalt for phosphate transport, and a MeHPO4 metal-phosphate complex was the proposed substrate. Not all metal phosphate complexes are good substrates for Pho84p, as the addition of magnesium was shown to actually have an inhibitory effect on phosphate transport with recombinant Pho84p (47Fristedt U. van der Rest M. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Persson B.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16010-16015Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we found an inhibitory effect of magnesium on the Pho84p-dependent uptake of manganese in vivo (data not shown). The preference of Pho84p for metal-phosphate complexes containing manganese (and also cobalt) is consistent with our proposal that Pho84p functions as a low affinity transporter for these metals in vivo. A phosphate transporter that utilizes a metal-phosphate complex as a substrate is not unique to yeast. Bacterial phosphate transporters from Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter johnsonii have been described that require the presence of divalent cations for phosphate transport in reconstituted proteoliposomes (48van Veen H.W. Abee T. Kortstee G.J. Konings W.N. Zehnder A.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1766-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 49van Veen H.W. Abee T. Kortstee G.J. Konings W.N. Zehnder A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19377-19383Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These bacterial phosphate transporters show a striking biochemical similarity to Pho84p. The substrate for both Pho84p and the bacterial phosphate transporters are thought to be neutral metal-phosphate complex, and each of these transporters shows a preference for MnHPO4 (47Fristedt U. van der Rest M. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Persson B.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16010-16015Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 48van Veen H.W. Abee T. Kortstee G.J. Konings W.N. Zehnder A.J.

Pho84p is homologous to transporters from mammalian, plant, fungal, and bacterial sources and include transporters for both phosphate and sugars (50Henderson P.J. Curr. Opin.

Although Pho84p is the first eukaryotic phosphate transporter described with a role in metal transport, it is likely that this type of system is present in higher organisms, including humans. Exposure to high concentrations of manganese has been shown to result in the development of manganism, a neurological disorder similar to Parkinson's Disease that is characterized by high concentrations of manganese in the brain (14Pal P.K.

It is possible that neuronally expressed homologues to Pho84p contribute to manganese accumulation under metal surplus conditions. The unexpected connection between phosphate and manganese metabolism revealed here with studies in yeast may have implications in the understanding of manganese toxicity and diseases of manganese exposure in humans."

Here, we present a 106,000-year record of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) along with corresponding isotopic records spanning the last 30,000 years, which together suggest minimal changes in the ratio of marine to terrestrial N2O production. During the last glacial termination, both marine and oceanic N2O emissions increased by 40 +/- 8%. We speculate that our records do not support those hypotheses that invoke enhanced export production to explain low carbon dioxide values during glacial periods."
https://openalex.org/W2102521454,"Leptin, a 16 kDa pleiotropic cytokine primarily expressed in adipose tissue, has been shown to cause multiple systemic biological actions. Recently, leptin has also been documented as an important component of the wound healing process and its receptor appears to be expressed in wound tissue. We have previously demonstrated that leptin is a potent angiogenic factor exerting direct effects on endothelial cells and that transcription of its encoding gene is regulated by hypoxia. Here, we hypothesize that leptin expression is acutely up-regulated in the ischemic tissue of experimental wounds. Using a combination of in situ hybridization and quantitative RT-PCR experiments, we show that leptin expression is rapidly and steadily up-regulated in skin tissue from incisional and excisional wounds. By immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate increased and sustained leptin protein levels in basal keratinocytes, blood vessel walls, and fibroblasts. To determine whether leptin is required for normal healing, excisional wounds were treated with neutralizing anti-leptin antibodies. This treatment markedly hampered healing progression and prevented wound closure and contraction. Finally, a transient rise in circulating blood leptin levels was detected within the first 24 h after inflicting the injury; we present evidence suggesting that this elevation is due to increased leptin production at the ischemic wound site. We conclude that leptin is acutely up-regulated in the injured skin and propose that this local production of leptin serves a critical functional role as an autocrine/paracrine regulator of normal wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W2162807163,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a profound movement disorder resulting from progressive degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. Although its etiology remains unknown, increasing evidence suggests the involvement of multiple factors such as environmental toxins and genetic susceptibilities in the pathogenesis of PD. In this study using mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures as an in vitro PD model, we demonstrated that the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP, 0.1-0.5 microM) and an inflammogen lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.5 ng/ml) synergistically induced a progressive and selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. The synergistic neurotoxicity was observed when both agents were applied either simultaneously or in tandem. The synergistic neurotoxicity was more prominent when lower doses of both agents were applied for a longer period of time. Mechanistically, microglial NADPH oxidase-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species played a pivotal role in the synergistic neurotoxicity: MPTP and LPS synergistically stimulated the NADPH oxidase-mediated release of superoxide free radical; pharmacological inhibition and genetic inactivation of NADPH oxidase prevented superoxide production and the synergistic neurotoxicity. Additionally, inhibition of nitric oxide synthase afforded significant neuroprotection, suggesting the involvement of nitric oxide in the synergistic neurotoxicity. This study lends strong support for a multifactorial etiology of PD and provides clues for therapeutic interventions."

In the present study we found that the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase activity of cyclophilin is fully inactivated in the oxidized form. Reduction of cyclophilin by thioredoxin-m recovered the isomerase activity. Two crucial disulfide bonds were determined by disulfide-linked peptide mapping. The relevance of these cysteines for isomerase activity was confirmed by the mutagenesis studies. Because four cysteine residues in Arabidopsis thaliana cyclophilin were conserved in the isoforms from several organisms, it appears that this redox regulation must be one of the common regulation systems of cyclophilin.

Heitman J. Gething M.-J. Guidebook to Molecular Chaperones and Protein-folding Catalysts. Oxford University Press, 1997: 359-369Google Scholar). CyP shows peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) activity and functions as a catalyst in protein folding, facilitating the slow isomerization around Xaa-Pro peptide bonds, which is a general rate-limiting step of protein folding (2Takahashi N.

However, the physiological significance of CyP in plant cytoplasm and in chloroplasts has been obscure thus far (9Luan S. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Luan S. Albers M.W. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The important function of CyP in the process of T-cell activation for the regulation of immunosuppression in mammalian cells suggests that CyP also has an important physiological role in the plant cell, e.g. in signal transduction. Although CyPs of some eukaryotic organisms have several conserved cysteines, there is still no information available on the role of these cysteines. However, we found that CyP is the potential target protein of chloroplast thioredoxin (Trx) (16Motohashi K. Kondoh A. Stumpp M.T. Hisabori T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11224-11229Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Trx is a small, ubiquitous, disulfide oxidoreductase with two redox active cysteines at the active center (17Buchanan B.B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1980; 31: 341-374Crossref Google Scholar, 18Schürmann P. Jacquot J.P. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 371-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 19Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The active site sequence (-Trp-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-) of Trx is well conserved regardless of the lower overall sequence homology. Trx induces a conformational change in the target protein via exchange of the disulfide bond and thereby modulates the activity of these enzymes. The mechanism for reduction of target proteins by Trx has been studied in vitro (20Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Holmgren A. Structure. 1995; 3: 239-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The first Cys in the active site sequence of Trx probably forms a mixed disulfide intermediate with the target protein. Then the established disulfide bond between the two redox partners is attacked by another cysteine of Trx. Consequently the reduced form of the target protein is released from Trx, and Trx itself is oxidized. In the chloroplasts of higher plants two Trx isoforms, designated f-type (Trx-f) and m-type (Trx-m) based on their first identified target proteins, are well known (18Schürmann P. Jacquot J.P. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 371-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 22Jacquot J.P. Lancelin J.M. Meyer Y.

Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The various chloroplast enzymes are regulated by reduction of their internal disulfide or reoxidation of thiols. Calvin cycle enzymes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase, and phosphoribulokinase, are regulated by their redox states, and their activities are enhanced in the reduced enzymes (24Baumann U. Juttner J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 1042-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recently several approaches to identify the target proteins of Trx have been challenged (16Motohashi K.

A. 2003; 100: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Within the captured candidate proteins, we identified CyP as an unreported Trx target in chloroplasts (16Motohashi K. Kondoh A. Stumpp M.T. Hisabori T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11224-11229Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In the present study, we revealed that CyP in chloroplasts is an actual target protein of Trx and that the PPIase activity of CyP is regulated by the reduction of the internal disulfide bond by Trx-m. In addition, cysteine residues involved in this redox regulation were identified. Preparation of Trx-m—The recombinant Trx-m was expressed in Escherichia coli (27Stumpp M.T. Motohashi K. Hisabori T. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and was purified as follows. The E. coli cells were suspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), disrupted by a French pressure cell (5501-M, Ohtake Works, Tokyo), and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl 650 m column (Tosoh, Tokyo) and then eluted with a 0–150 mm linear gradient of NaCl in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.5 mm DTT. The peak fraction containing Trx-m was collected, and solid ammonium sulfate was added to be the final concentration of 1.6 m. The solution was then applied to a butyl-Toyopearl 650 m column, and eluted with a 1.6 to 0 m inverse gradient of ammonium sulfate. The protein concentration was calculated from the A 278 using the published molar absorption coefficient value for Trx-m, 20,500 m–1·cm–1 (28Schürmann P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 274-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Preparation of CyP—E. coli BL21(DE3) cell carrying CyP-pET23c, the plasmid for the wild-type CyP (CyPWT), was cultured at 37 °C, and the desired protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.5 mm) at 25 °C. CyPWT was obtained as soluble protein and purified as described previously (16Motohashi K. Kondoh A. Stumpp M.T. Hisabori T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11224-11229Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Preparation of the Mutant CyP—To prepare the mutant CyPs, CyPC53S/C170S, CyPC128S/C175S, and CyPC53S/C128S/C170S/C175S (CyPNoCys), site-directed mutagenesis was performed with mega-primer PCR method (29Landt O. Grunert H.P. Hahn U. Gene. 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar) using KOD DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka). The sequences of the resultant plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Prism 310, Applied Biosystems). When the desired proteins were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3), CyPC128S/C175S was obtained as soluble protein and could be purified by the method for CyPWT. However, CyPC53S/C170S and CyPNoCys were insoluble proteins and were purified as follows. After induction, the cells were suspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 5 mm EDTA, disrupted by sonication, and centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 10 min. The inclusion bodies obtained were suspended in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, and 2% (v/v) Triton X-100, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 10 min. This washing step was repeated twice. Then the precipitate was washed twice with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA and dissolved finally in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 8 m urea, and 0.5 mm DTT. The insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was diluted 50–100-fold with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm DTT. Solid ammonium sulfate was added to the diluted solution up to 1.3 m and the solution was applied to a butyl-Toyopearl 650 m column, which was equilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1.3 m ammonium sulfate. The protein was eluted from the column with a 1.3–0 m inverse gradient of ammonium sulfate. The peak fraction containing CyP was collected and stored at –80 °C. The protein concentration of CyP was determined by the method described previously (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar). In Vitro Reduction of CyP Assisted by Trx—The recombinant CyPs (both wild-type and mutants) were obtained in reduced form, and the oxidized form of CyP (CyPox) was prepared as described (16Motohashi K. Kondoh A. Stumpp M.T. Hisabori T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11224-11229Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Oxidized CyP (3.0 μm) was incubated with DTT (50 μm) in the presence or absence of Trx-m (3 μm) for 1 h at 25 °C. To assess the redox state of CyP, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidyl-stilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (AMS) (Molecular Probes), a maleimidyl reagent that specifically modifies cysteine residues, was used. AMS labeling was carried out as described previously (16Motohashi K. Kondoh A. Stumpp M.T. Hisabori T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11224-11229Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), and CyPox and reduced CyP (CyPred) were separated by 15% (w/v) SDS-PAGE. PPIase Activity of the Recombinant CyP—The PPIase activity of CyP was measured as described (31Liu J. Albers M.W. Chen C.M. Schreiber S.L. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2304-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 32Fischer G. Bang H. Berger E. Schellenberger A. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3041-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. An assay mixture containing 35 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 8.0), 50 μm N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (Peptide Institute) was incubated at 10 °C. α-Chymotrypsin (final concentration 20 μm) was added to initiate the reaction. CyP was added after 15 s. Absorbance at 360 nm was monitored by UV spectrophotometry. First-order rate constants (k obs) were derived by a curve fit to a first-order rate equation (A 360 = A 1+ A 0 e –kt, where k is the rate constant). The k cat/K m values were calculated according to the equation k cat/K m = (k obs – k 0)/[PPIase], where k 0 is the first-order rate constant for spontaneous cis-trans isomerization (31Liu J. Albers M.W. Chen C.M. Schreiber S.L. Walsh C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2304-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Peptide Mapping and Analysis—To determine the internal disulfide partner cysteines, CyPox was digested with sequencing grade modified trypsin (catalog no. V5111, Promega) for 20 h at 37 °C in 25 mm (NH4)HCO3, pH 7.0, with a protein-to-protease ratio of 90:1 (w/w), or sequencing grade chymotrypsin (catalog no. 1-418-467, Roche Diagnostics) for 15 h at 37 °C in 25 mm (NH4)HCO3, pH 7.8, containing 2 mm CaCl2, with a protein-to-protease ratio of 50:1 (w/w). The proteolytic peptides obtained were analyzed directly by reversed-phase HPLC or reduced before analysis. For reduction of the fragments obtained from CyPox, the mixture of proteolytic peptides was incubated with 10 mm DTT for 1 h at 37 °C in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Then, the peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC column (Cosmosil 5C18 AR-300, 4.6 × 150 mm, Nacalai tesque, Kyoto, Japan) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with solvent A (0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid) and solvent B (90% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) using the gradient elution (2% solvent B at 0–5 min, 2–50% solvent B at 5–50 min, 50–80% solvent B at 50–60 min, 80% solvent B at 60–70 min). The peptide fragments were monitored at 220 nm. N-terminal amino acid sequences of the separated fragments were analyzed by N-terminal peptide sequencing (PPSQ-21, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) and their molecular masses were determined by using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Axima-CFR, Shimadzu). The Quantitative Analysis of Sulfhydryl Groups—The number of free sulfhydryl groups in CyP molecule was determined using 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (34Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21474) Google Scholar). 5,5′-Dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (final concentration of 0.4 mm) was added to CyP in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA and 6 m guanidine HCl. The absorbance at 412 nm was measured, and the amounts of reactive sulfhydryls were determined from ϵ412 = 13,380 m–1·cm–1 (35Glazer A.N. Delange R.J. Sigman D.S. Delange R.J. Sigman D.S. Chemical Modification of Proteins. Elsevier, Amsterdam1975: 21-25Google Scholar). The Oxidized CyP Is Inactive as PPIase—In the previous study, we reported that chloroplast CyP is a possible target protein for Trx-m and that CyPox could be reduced by Trx-m in vitro (16Motohashi K. Kondoh A. Stumpp M.T. Hisabori T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11224-11229Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). CyP, known as a member of the immunophilin superfamily, promotes the isomerization from cis-form to trans-form in peptidylproline. Therefore we examined whether the PPIase activity of CyP is affected by reduction or oxidation. We measured the PPIase activity using the model substrate N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide and monitored the change of the absorbance at 360 nm derived by the release of the methylcoumaryl moiety from the artificial model peptide when the trans-form peptide was digested by α-chymotrypsin. A slow increase in absorbance was observed even in the absence of the catalyzing enzyme, indicating that the model substrate was gradually transferred from the cis-form to the trans-form irrespective of PPIase (Fig. 1A, none). The addition of CyPox did not change the rate of increase in absorbance at 360 nm (Fig. 1A, CyPox). Thus, PPIase activity of CyP must be suppressed when CyP is present in the oxidized form. In contrast, the model substrate was rapidly shifted to the trans-form and digested by α-chymotrypsin when CyPred was added to the assay mixture (Fig. 1A, CyPred). The K obs value of PPIase activity was measured in the presence of various concentrations of CyPred or CyPox, and the k cat/K m values were calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1B and Table I). The activity of CyPox was less than 1% of the CyPred activity, suggesting that CyP is inactive in the oxidized form.Table IPPIase activity of oxidized or reduced CyPConditionkcat/Kms-1 μm-1CyPred8.32CyPox + Trx-m + DTT4.57CyPox + DTT1.14CyPox + Trx-m0.04CyPox0.07 Open table in a new tab CyP ox Can Be Reduced, and the PPIase Activity Is Reactivated by Trx-m—We examined whether CyPox could be reduced and the PPIase activity reactivated by Trx-m. When CyPox was incubated with Trx-m only, PPIase activity was not observed (Fig. 1B). Weak PPIase activity was detected when 50 μm DTT was used instead of Trx-m. In contrast, PPIase activity recovered to 55% of the rate observed in the reduced state when Trx-m was added together with 50 μm DTT (Fig. 1B and Table I). Inactivation and partial recovery of PPIase activity was dependent on the redox conditions following the redox state of CyP, which was visualized by AMS labeling (Fig. 2). Identification of Cysteine Pairs Involved in Disulfide Bond Formation in CyP ox —CyP from A. thaliana contains four cysteine residues allowing six different combinations of disulfide bonds. To specify the cysteine pairs involved in disulfide formation that are responsible for the regulation of the PPIase activity, CyPox was digested by proteases, and the resultant peptide fragments were separated by reversed-phase HPLC after incubation under non-reduced or reduced conditions (Fig. 3). We identified a single redox-responsive peptide fragment in trypsin-digested and in chymotrypsin-digested fragments of CyPox, respectively (Fig. 3A, TO1, and Fig. 3C, CTO1). Under reduced conditions, TO1 emerged with two specific peaks (Fig. 3B, TR1 and TR2). In the case of the reduced fragments after chymotrypsin digestion, CTO1 disappeared and three specific peaks emerged (Fig. 3D, CTR1, CTR2, and CTR3). The elution profiles of the peptide fragments from CyPred were very similar to those of CyPox proteolytic fragments after reduction (data not shown). These redox-specific peptide fragments were analyzed by N-terminal peptide sequencing and mass spectrometry (Table II). TO1 obtained by trypsin digestion of CyPox was composed of two peptides, which were recovered as two peaks, TR1 and TR2, under reduced conditions. The TR1 peptide contains Cys175, whereas TR2 contains Cys128. Therefore these two cysteines should form the disulfide bond. In the case of chymotrypsin cleavage, CTO1 was composed of two peptides containing Cys53 and Cys170, respectively. The peptide containing Cys53 of CyP was recovered as CTR1 in the reduced fragments. The peptide containing Cys170 was not identified in the fragments under reduced conditions. In contrast, CTR2, which possibly contains Cys53, and CTR3, containing Cys175, were obtained only from the reduced fragments. The failure to detect additional peaks corresponding to cysteine containing fragments under reduced and oxidized conditions might be attributed to an incomplete digestion by chymotrypsin or the insufficient separation of the peptides by the reversed-phase HPLC. As a consequence, we were able to determine two disulfide bond pairs, Cys53–Cys170 and Cys128–Cys175, in CyPox (Fig. 4A). To confirm the formation of these two disulfide bonds in CyP, the number of free sulfhydryl groups in oxidized or reduced CyP was quantified with 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). According to these measurements CyPox contained 0.2 mol of thiol/mol of CyP, and CyPred contained 4.0 mol of thiol/mol of CyP.Table IIPeptide mapping analysis of oxidized CyP using N-terminal peptide sequencer and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometryPeptide fractionPeptide fragmentaResidue numbers denote the amino acid positions in the sequence of the mature protein.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 4The suggested disulfide bonds in CyP and the redox state of Cys mutants. A, the identified disulfide bonds in CyP are presented schematically. B, the oxidized (ox) or reduced (red) form of CyP mutants (3 μm) was incubated with Trx-m (3 μm) or DTT (50 μm) or both. The redox states of CyP were monitored by the AMS labeling method. In lane “red,” original CyPs were AMS-labeled; lane “ox,” CyPs were oxidized before AMS-labeling; lane “ox + DTT + M,” oxidized CyPs were incubated with Trx-m and DTT. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Both Disulfide Bonds in CyP ox Inactivate the PPIase Activity and Are Reduced by Trx-m—A CyPNoCys mutant, containing no cysteines, and two cysteine mutants, CyPC53S/C170S and CyPC128S/C175S, which cannot form either of the internal disulfide bonds identified above, were constructed. The PPIase activities of these mutants were examined under oxidizing and reducing conditions to determine the redox-responsive disulfide bonds in the molecule. Although the PPIase activities of three mutants were affected by the number of deleted cysteines, redox sensitivity of the PPIase activity was clearly maintained in the case of CyPC53S/C170S and CyPC128S/C175S (Table III). Redox sensitivity of the internal disulfide bonds in these mutants was confirmed by AMS-labeled CyP mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4B). The PPIase activity of CyPNoCys was remarkably lower than that of other mutants and was not affected by the reduction or oxidation (Table III). This insensitivity was also confirmed by AMS labeling (Fig. 4B). As observed in Fig. 4B, CyPC128S/C175S was greatly reduced by Trx-m and DTT, although activity was not recovered very much by reduction (Table III). This apparent discrepancy might be due to the instability of the mutant protein after the redox treatment. Taken together, both Cys53–Cys170 and Cys128–Cys175 disulfide bonds were redox-sensitive and involved in redox regulation of the PPIase activity of CyP.Table IIIPPIase activity change of CyP mutants under redox conditionsCypkcat/KmCyPredCyPoxCyPox + Trx-m + DTTs-1 μm-1WT8.210.135.45C53S/C170S7.120.123.02C128S/C175S5.740.071.83No Cys1.361.331.13 Open table in a new tab CyP Is a Trx-Regulated Enzyme—In the present study, we observed that the PPIase activity of CyP is modulated by the redox state of the molecule and revealed that CyPox is an inactive PPIase, whereas CyPred is an active one (Fig. 1). A disulfide bond in CyPox was definitely reduced by Trx-m, and the PPIase activity of CyP was recovered by the reduction of disulfide bonds in CyP. We identified two critical disulfide bonds involved in the thiol modulation of PPIase activity, Cys53–Cys170 and Cys128–Cys175. Cyclophilin 3 from Caenorhabditis elegans has four cysteine residues, which correspond to the residues in A. thaliana. Their amino acid sequence homology is very high; the identity of the amino acids was 65%. The crystal structure of cyclophilin 3 has been reported (36Dornan J. Page A.P. Taylor P. Wu S. Winter A.D. Husi H. Walkinshaw M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34877-34883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and the distance between Cα–Cα in each disulfide bond pair of CyPox in A. thaliana could be estimated based on the coordinates of the three-dimensional structure of cyclophilin 3. The distances between Cα–Cα in Cys53–Cys170 and Cys128–Cys175 was estimated as 16.49 and 18.91 Å, respectively. When Dornan et al. (36Dornan J. Page A.P. Taylor P. Wu S. Winter A.D. Husi H. Walkinshaw M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34877-34883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reported the structure, they suggested the possible disulfide bond formation in cyclophilin 3 because the distance between the sulfur atoms of Cys40 and Cys168 (corresponding to Cys53 and Cys175 of CyP from A. thaliana) was close enough (5.38 Å) to form the bond. However, disulfide bond formation between Cys53 and Cys175 has not been found in our case (Table II and Fig. 4). As the calculated distances between Cα–Cα in Cys53–Cys170 and Cys128–Cys175 were too great to form the intramolecular disulfides, a remarkable conformational change may occur when CyP is oxidized, which may be the cause of the loss of PPIase activity. Physiological Role of Redox Regulation of CyP—In the thylakoid lumen, a 40-kDa cyclophilin-like protein named TLP40 had been reported (37Fulgosi H. Vener A.V. Altschmied L. Herrmann R.G. Andersson B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1577-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). TLP40 shows PPIase activity and affects the dephosphorylation of several key proteins of photosystem II, probably as a constituent of a transmembrane signal transduction chain (38Vener A.V. Rokka A. Fulgosi H. Andersson B. Herrmann R.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14955-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Another cyclophilin is CyP40, which has a cyclophilin-like PPIase domain in the N terminus and has been identified as a regulatory factor in the vegetative phase of A. thaliana (39Berardini T.Z. Bollman K. Sun H. Poethig R.S. Science. 2001; 291: 2405-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Thus cyclophilin-related molecules seem to have significant roles in various compartments of the plant cell and in chloroplasts. So far, the role of CyP in chloroplasts is uncertain. Here we found that CyP in chloroplasts is redox-sensitive and its PPIase activity is modulated by the redox states via Trx-m. Light initiates many physiological phenomena in chloroplasts including biogenesis of proteins. Therefore, the accurate activation of the PPIase activity of CyP under reducing conditions must be physiologically meaningful, as CyP is a member of the protein folding catalyst proteins. Recently, Lee et al. (40Lee S.P. Hwang Y.S. Kim Y.J. Kwon K.S. Kim H.J. Kim K. Chae H.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29826-29832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) have reported that a mammalian cyclophilin, CyP-A, binds to 1-Cys peroxiredoxin and supports the peroxidase activity as an electron donor. This finding allowed proposing the cascade from Trx to 1-Cys peroxiredoxin via cyclophilin in the cell. However we could not yet identify the counterpart proteins of CyP in chloroplasts under the physiological conditions, and further studies will be required to understand the physiological significance of the redox transmission network involving CyP in chloroplast. Perspective—It appears that the reduction/oxidation cascade via Trx in chloroplasts must be an important regulation network for the metabolic pathways in chloroplasts. Actually various metabolic enzymes are suggested to be involved in this network (16Motohashi K. Kondoh A. Stumpp M.T. Hisabori T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11224-11229Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 26Balmer Y. Koller A. del Val G. Manieri W. Schurmann P. Buchanan B.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 370-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have clearly shown the redox regulation of the PPIase activity of CyP. Although we do not have information on the physiological contribution of CyP in chloroplasts at the moment, and we do not know why CyP-PPIase activity was affected by their redox states, our finding should be important in revealing the role of CyP in chloroplasts. Further studies in vivo are necessary to clarify the physiological significance of redox regulation of CyP together with structure analysis to understand the redox regulation of PPIase activity.

https://openalex.org/W2128537053,"The metastasis-associated protein MTA1 has been shown to express differentially to high levels in metastatic cells. MTA2, which is homologous to MTA1, is a component of the NuRD ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylase complex. Here we report evidence that although both human MTA1 and MTA2 repress transcription specifically, are located in the nucleus, and contain associated histone deacetylase activity, they exist in two biochemically distinct protein complexes and may perform different functions pertaining to tumor metastasis. Specifically, both MTA1 and MTA2 complexes exert histone deacetylase activity. However, the MTA1 complex contained HDAC1/2, RbAp46/48, and MBD3, but not Sin3 or Mi2, two important components of the MTA2 complex. Moreover, the MTA2 complex is similar to the HDAC1 complex, suggesting a housekeeping role of the MTA2 complex. The MTA1 complex could be further separated, resulting in a core MTA1-HDAC complex, showing that the histone deacetylase activity and transcriptional repression activity were integral properties of the MTA1 complex. Finally, MTA1, unlike MTA2, did not interact with the pleotropic transcription factor YY1 or the immunophilin FKBP25. We suggest that MTA1 associates with a different set of transcription factors from MTA2 and that this property may contribute to the metastatic potential of cells overexpressing MTA1. We also report the finding of human MTA3, which is highly homologous to both MTA1 and MTA2. However, MTA3 does not repress transcription to a significant level and appears to have a diffused pattern of subcellular localization, suggesting a biological role distinct from that of the other two MTA proteins.

Metastasis represents one of the fundamental differences between benign and malignant tumors and poses a major obstacle in effective cancer treatment. The metastasis-associated gene 1 (MTA1) is closely associated with cancer metastasis. The rat mta1 gene was first identified using differential cDNA library screening techniques in a mammary adenocarcinoma metastatic system (1Pencil S.D. Toh Y. Nicolson G.L. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1993; 25: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 2Toh Y. Pencil S.D. Nicolson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22958-22963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Toh Y. Pencil S.D. Nicolson G.L. Gene. 1995; 159: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The expression levels of MTA1 are elevated in human metastatic breast cell lines (2Toh Y. Pencil S.D. Nicolson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22958-22963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and metastatic cancer tissues, such as breast, colorectal, gastric, and esophageal carcinomas (2Toh Y.

Cancer. 1999; 79: 1723-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Overexpression of MTA1 correlates with enhancement of the ability of human breast cancer cells to invade and to grow in an anchorage-independent manner (6Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In patients, colorectal and gastric carcinomas overexpressing MTA1 show deeper invasion and higher rates of penetration into lymph nodes (4Toh Y. Oki E. Oda S. Tokunaga E. Ohno S. Maehara Y. Nicolson G.L. Sugimachi K. Intl. J. Cancer. 1997; 74: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In culture, administration of antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides specific for MTA1 inhibits the rapid growth of human breast cancer cells that express high levels of MTA1 compared with normal breast epithelial cells (7Nawa A. Nishimori K. Lin P. Maki Y. Moue K. Sawada H. Toh Y. Fumitaka K. Nicolson G.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 79: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Although evidence shows that MTA1 is closely linked to cancer metastasis, it was unclear how MTA1 is involved in the metastatic process. Genetic studies in Caenorhabditis elegans suggest that MTA1 may function in embryonic patterning, determination of cell polarity, and cell migration (8Herman M.A. Ch'ng Q. Hettenbach S.M. Ratliff T.M. Kenyon C. Herman R.K. Development. 1999; 126: 1055-1064PubMed Google Scholar, 9Solari F. Bateman A. Ahringer J. Development. 1999; 126: 2483-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, an MTA1 homologue, MTA2, was found to be part of an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling complex called NuRD (nucleosome remodeling histone deacetylation) (10Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). Interestingly, NuRD also has histone deacetylase activity (11Zhang Y. LeRoy G. Seelig H.P. Lane W.S. Reinberg D. Cell. 1998; 95: 279-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, DNA is packaged into chromatin (12Kornberg R.D. Thomas J.O. Science. 1974; 184: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 13Kornberg R.D. Science. 1974; 184: 868-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). Formation of closed chromatin precludes the access of transcription factors to DNA and inevitably leads to transcriptional repression (14Knezetic J.A. Luse D.S. Cell. 1986; 45: 95-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 15Lorch Y. LaPointe J.W. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1987; 49: 203-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Dynamic changes in the chromatin structure, therefore, lead to either transcriptional activation or transcriptional repression. Alteration of the chromatin structure utilizing energy derived from ATP hydrolysis is called “chromatin remodeling” and is one of the two transcriptional regulatory mechanisms at the chromatin level (reviewed in Refs. 16Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar and 17Urnov F.D. Wolffe A.P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2991-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The other mechanism involves covalent modifications of nucleosomes, the basic units of chromatin. Nucleosomes are formed by DNA wrapping around a histone octamer, which composes of two copies of four histone proteins, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (12Kornberg R.D. Thomas J.O. Science. 1974; 184: 865-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar, 18Kelley R.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1973; 54: 1588-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 19Roark D.E. Geoghegan T.E. Keller G.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 59: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The N termini of core histones are exposed and unstructured (20Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar); these exposed tails are thought to contact neighboring core histones as well as DNA and are critical in mediating higher order structures of chromatin. As a result, covalent modifications of nucleosomes also lead to changes in the chromatin structure. One of the most well studied nucleosomal modification is acetylation and deacetylation of histone proteins at the unstructured N-terminal tails (reviewed in Ref. 16Kingston R.E. Narlikar G.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2339-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The addition of acetyl groups to the N-terminal tails of histones is catalyzed by histone acetyltransferases and the hydrolysis of the acetylated histone tails by HDACs. 1The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein.1The abbreviations used are: HDAC, histone deacetylase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein. Acetylation of histone proteins opens up the chromatin structure and leads to transcriptional activation (21Hong L. Schroth G.P. Matthews H.R. Yau P. Bradbury E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 305-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, deacetylation of histone proteins condenses the chromatin structure and is associated with transcriptional repression (reviewed in Ref. 22Cress W.D. Seto E. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The finding that MTA2 is found in a protein complex containing both ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling activity and histone deacetylase activity suggests that the molecular mechanism of tumor metastasis might involve aberrant regulations of the chromatin structure.Shortly after the discovery of the NuRD complex, MTA1 was found to be a component of another protein complex with histone deacetylase activity (23Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Cote J. Wang W. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 851-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Furthermore, evidence shows that MTA1 may repress estrogen receptor-mediated transcription by recruiting HDACs, leading to loss of estradiol responsiveness and progression of breast cancer to more invasive phenotypes (6Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). However, despite the high homology between MTA1 and MTA2, MTA2 has not been shown to involve in metastasis or cancer formation. The level of MTA2 remains constant while MTA1 protein level is up-regulated by heregulin-β1 in breast cancer cells (6Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The findings that the homologous proteins MTA1 and MTA2 are both present in HDAC-containing complexes but only MTA1 has been concretely linked to cancer metastasis pose a conundrum.To further understand the biological functions of MTA1 and MTA2, we used a variety of assays to probe the differences and similarities between the MTA proteins. We also found a third member of the human MTA family, MTA3. We found that both MTA1 and MTA2 mediate transcriptional repression, but MTA3 does not appear to repress transcription to a significant level. In addition, MTA1 and MTA2 form distinct protein complexes, both containing histone deacetylase activity. Our results suggest that although the highly homologous N-terminal regions of the MTA proteins are important in forming protein complexes with histone deacetylases, the divergent C termini are likely to be critical in modulating the histone deacetylase activity associated with the MTA complexes and possibly in the downstream biological events, including the metastatic process.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids—Gal4-MTA1 was expressed from pM1-MTA1, Gal4-MTA2 from pM2-MTA2, and Gal4-MTA3 from pM2-MTA3. pM1-MTA1, pM2-MTA2, and pM2-MTA3 were constructed by inserting the full-length MTA cDNAs in frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in pM1 (24Sadowski I.

GFPHDAC1, which expressed an N-terminal fusion of GFP to HDAC1, was made by inserting HDAC1 cDNA into pEGFP.FLAG-tagged MTA1 (FLAG-MTA1) was expressed from pME18S-MTA1, which was generated by inserting the MTA1 cDNA into pME18S (25Laherty C.D.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested and a luciferase assay performed using the dual luciferase assay system (Promega).Fluorescence Microscopy—HeLa cells were seeded on chamber slides and grown for 18 h. 5 μg of expression plasmids for various GFP fusion proteins were transfected into cells using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (31Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6475) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours later, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, rinsed with cold PBS again, and dried. One drop of anti-fade mounting medium with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector) was added to the cells before coverslips were applied. Fluorescence images were observed and analyzed under a fluorescence microscope.Immunoprecipitation, Western Blot Analysis, and Histone Deacetylase Assay—Immunoprecipitation of FLAG-MTA1, FLAG-MTA1*, and FLAG-MTA2 was carried out using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) following the manufacturer's suggestions. Western blot analyses were performed using standard protocols (32Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 490-505Google Scholar).Histone deacetylase assay was performed using immunoprecipitated MTA proteins or the eluted fractions of the FLAG fusion protein complexes as the source of the enzyme and a labeled peptide corresponding to residues 2-24 of histone H4 as substrate following a previously published procedure except that incubation was performed at room temperature overnight (33Taunton J. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1996; 272: 408-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). Trichostatin A (400 nm final concentration) (Sigma) was added to the FLAG-MTA1 immunoprecipitate 30 min prior to the addition of the H4 substrate peptide in one of the reactions.Protein Complex Purification—Anti-FLAG immunoaffinity columns were prepared using anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) following the manufacturer's suggestions. Approximately for every 6 × 107 HeLa cells, 5 μg of the plasmids expressing FLAG fusion proteins were transfected using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (31Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6475) Google Scholar). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested by scraping. Cells were subsequently lysed by adding PBS plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and then briefly sonicating. Cell lysate obtained from about 4.8 × 109 cells was applied to an equilibrated FLAG column of 1-ml bed volume to allow for adsorption of the protein complex to the column resin. After binding, the column was washed with cold PBS plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40. FLAG peptide (Sigma) was applied to the column as described by the manufacturer to elute the FLAG protein complex. Fractions of 1 bed volume were collected.For the purification of the MTA1-HDAC complex, anti-HDAC2 antibody (25Laherty C.D. Yang W.M. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) was used to pack an immunoaffinity column following a previously published method (34Zhang Y. Sun Z.W. Iratni R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1021-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Eluted FLAG-MTA1 complex was applied to the anti-HDAC2 column and allowed for adsorption. After extensive washing, the MTA1-HDAC complex was eluted with excess HDAC2 peptide that contained the epitope of the anti-HDAC2 antibody (25Laherty C.D. Yang W.M. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar).In Vitro Protein-Protein Interaction Assay—35S-Labeled MTA1 was generated from pGEM7Zf3X-MTA1 using T7 RNA polymerase and the TNT Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega). 35S-labeled MTA2 was generated using the same method from pGEM7Zf3X-MTA2. GST, GST-p53, GST-FKBP12, GST-FKBP25, and GST-YY1 were expressed in Escherichia coli strain DH5α and captured onto glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). In vitro translated MTA1 or MTA2 (5 μl) was mixed with the beads in the presence of PBS plus 0.2% Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed extensively in PBS plus 0.2% Nonidet P-40. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and detected by Coomassie Blue staining and autoradiography.RESULTSMTA1 and MTA2 Are Highly Homologous in the N Terminus but Divergent in the C Terminus—To further understand the potential functions of MTA1 and MTA2 and to probe the functional differences between them, we began by analyzing the primary structure of the MTA proteins. Human MTA2 is 65% identical to human MTA1, with the highest homology concentrated in the N-terminal half of the proteins. The C-terminal half of the MTA proteins is divergent; data base searches (EMBL) show that in MTA1 there are a GATA zinc finger domain, a bipartite nuclear localization signal embedded in a myb DNA-binding domain, and an Src homology 3 binding domain (Fig. 1A). MTA2 also contains a GATA zinc finger domain and a nuclear localization signal, but there is no C-terminal myb domain or Src homology 3 binding domain in MTA2. It has not been shown that MTA1 possesses DNA binding activity; therefore, the consequence of the additional myb DNA-binding domain in MTA1 is unclear. However, the functional differences between MTA1 and MTA2, if any, might relate to the differences in the C-terminal parts of the proteins.Contrary to the C-terminal half, the N-terminal half of the MTA proteins is highly similar and can be organized into four functional domains. At the extreme N terminus is a BAH (bromo-adjacent homology) domain, followed by an ELM2 (Egl-27 and MTA1 homology 2) domain (InterPro, European Bioinformatics Institute). Next is a conserved leucine zipper. C-terminal to the leucine zipper is a SANT domain related to the myb DNA-binding domain. The BAH domain has been identified in a number of transcriptional regulators including DNA cytosine-5 methyltransferase (35Nicolas R.H. Goodwin G.H. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 175: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 36Callebaut I. Courvalin J.C. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and the Orc1 (origin recognition complex 1) protein (36Callebaut I. Courvalin J.C. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the BAH domain may serve as a protein-protein interaction module linking DNA methylation, replication, and transcriptional regulation together (36Callebaut I. Courvalin J.C. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 37Goodwin G.H. Nicolas R.H. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 268: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The ELM2 domain was named after the C. elegans homologue of MTA1, Egl-27, and MTA1. Although many unidentified proteins in C. elegans, Drosophila, Xenopus laevis, Arabidopsis thaliana, and humans also contain the unique ELM2 domain (Fig. 1B), it is unclear what function this domain might have. However, CoREST, a specific co-repressor for REST/NRSF (RE1 silencing transcription factor/neural restrictive factor) required for the regulation of neuron-specific gene expression (38Andres M.E. Burger C. Peral-Rubio M.J. Battaglioli E. Anderson M.E. Grimes J. Dallman J. Ballas N. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9873-9878Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), also contains the ELM2 domain (Fig. 1B).Interestingly, CoREST shares another domain, the SANT (SWI3/ADA2/NCoR/TFIIIB) domain, with MTA1 and MTA2. SANT domains are present in a variety of transcriptional regulators, including SWI3 of the yeast SWI/SNF transcriptional activation complex; ADA2 of the ADA activation complex; and NCoR and SMRT, two co-repressors mediating inducible repression by steroid hormone receptors (reviewed in Ref. 39Aasland R. Stewart A.F. Gibson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 87-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that SANT domains are important in protein complex assembly in a recent study documenting the purification of stable protein complexes containing HDAC1 and HDAC2 (40Guenther M.G. Barak O. Lazar M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6091-6101Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 41You A. Tong J.K. Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1454-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). The juxtaposition of the SANT domain and the leucine zipper in the MTA proteins suggests the presence of a functional module in the formation of protein complexes.In summary, domain structures of MTA1 and MTA2 suggest that the MTA proteins are transcriptional regulators capable of forming protein complexes. The unique C-terminal regions of MTA1 and MTA2 might confer additional regulatory roles to the differences in their biological functions.Human MTA3—Through homology search, we identified a human cDNA clone that is highly homologous to MTA1 and MTA2 (clone KIAA1266; Kazuda DNA Research Institute). This clone was confirmed by dideoxyribonucleotide sequencing to contain a full-length open reading frame, and we named this protein human MTA3 (Fig. 1C). MTA3 appeared to share the highest homology with MTA1 and MTA2 in the N terminus (Fig. 1C). It is likely that MTA1, MTA2, and MTA3 represent members of the same gene family, and they might possess distinct or overlapping functions.MTA1 and MTA2 Repress Transcription, whereas MTA3 Has Minimal Repression Activity—Chimeric proteins of MTA1, MTA2, and MTA3 fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain were constructed to test whether they could repress transcription from a promoter containing Gal4-binding sites (Fig. 2A). Gal4-MTA1, Gal4-MTA2, or Gal4-MTA3 was co-transfected into HeLa cells with a reporter plasmid, G5TKLuc, which contained five Gal4-binding sites within the thymidine kinase promoter driving the luciferase reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 2B, whereas Gal4-MTA1 repressed the target promoter more than 10-fold (compare lane 4 with lane 3), it had no significant effect on an identical promoter with no Gal4-binding site (lanes 1 and 2). Similarly, Gal4-MTA2 also repressed transcription from the promoter containing Gal4-binding sites (lane 5). Furthermore, overexpression of MTA1 alone did not repress the thymidine kinase promoter with the Gal4-binding sites, strongly suggesting that the repression is specifically from Gal4-MTA1 (lane 8). Moreover, a carboxyl-terminally truncated form of MTA1 (Gal4-MTA1*, containing amino acids 1-387; lane 6) lost most of the transcriptional repression activity. Most significantly, the transcriptional repression activity of MTA3 appeared to be significantly lower than that of MTA1 or MTA2 (lane 7). These results demonstrate that MTA1 and MTA2 are able to repress transcription when recruited to a target promoter. More importantly, the reduced level of transcriptional repression activity observed for MTA3 and a C-terminally truncated form of MTA1 suggests that the C terminus of the MTA proteins has regulatory roles pertaining to the biological functions of the MTA family.Fig. 2Both MTA1 and MTA2 exhibit strong transcriptional repression activity, whereas MTA3 shows significantly reduced repression activity. A, a schematic diagram of Gal4-MTA fusion proteins. B, Gal4-MTA fusion protein constructs were transfected into HeLa cells together with a luciferase gene reporter with or without five tandem Gal4 DNA binding sites. Results shown are means ± S.D. drawn from at least four transfection experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)MTA1 and MTA2, but Not MTA3, Are Located in the Nucleus—Transcriptional regulation takes place in the nucleus. To confirm the functional significance of the MTA proteins with respect to transcriptional repression, the subcellular localization of the MTA proteins was analyzed by direct fluorescence. GFP-MTA1, GFP-MTA2, and GFP-MTA3 fusion constructs were transfected into HeLa cells. After 48 h, transfected cells were fixed, and the localization of fluorescence was observed under a fluorescence microscope. As shown in Fig. 3, GFPMTA1 and GFP-MTA2 were clearly localized to the nucleus compared with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) counterstaining for DNA. GFP was nonspecifically localized to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and GFP-HDAC1 was localized to the nucleus as previously reported (29Yang W.M. Yao Y.L. Seto E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4814-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). GFP-MTA3, however, appeared to have a diffused distribution and failed to localize to a specific subcellular locale (Fig. 3o). This result, together with the finding that MTA3 lacked significant repression activity, suggests that the major function of MTA3 may not involve transcriptional regulation.Fig. 3Nuclear localization of MTA1 and MTA2. HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-MTA1, GFP-MTA2, GFP-MTA3, or GFP-HDAC1 expression constructs and fixed. Fluorescence microscopy revealed nuclear localization of GFP-MTA1 and GFP-MTA2 similar to that of GFP-HDAC1. GFP-MTA3, on the contrary, had a nonspecific localization pattern similar to that of GFP.

 examine the most likely culprit for this cooling: an outburst of fresh water from a vast, ice-dammed glacial lake in North America. The superlake had formed when the kilometers-thick ice sheet covering much of North America disintegrated. When the ice dam became unstable, fresh water flooded from the lake into the North Atlantic. It remains unclear how this fresh water affected ocean circulation or whether the outburst occurred in more than one stage, but the timing points strongly to the outburst flood as the trigger of the 8200-year climate event."
https://openalex.org/W2160882954,"The severity of many inherited disorders is influenced by genetic background. We describe a modifier interaction in C57BL/6Jmice that converts a chronic movement disorder into a lethal neurological disease. The primary mutation (medJ) changes a splice donor site of the sodium channel gene Scn8a (Nav1.6). The modifier mutation is characteristic of strain C57BL/6Jand introduces a nonsense codon into sodium channel modifier 1 (SCNM1), a zinc finger protein and a putative splice factor. An internally deleted SCNM1 protein is also predicted as a result of exon skipping associated with disruption of a consensus exonic splicing enhancer. The effect of the modifier mutation is to reduce the abundance of correctly spliced sodium channel transcripts below the threshold for survival. Our finding that genetic variation in a putative RNA splicing factor influences disease susceptibility in mice raises the possibility that a similar mechanism modifies the severity of human inherited disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2141578030,"Protein synthesis, in particular peptide chain elongation, is an energy-consuming biosynthetic process. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key regulatory enzyme involved in cellular energy homeostasis. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that, as in liver, it could mediate the inhibition of protein synthesis by oxygen deprivation in heart by modulating the phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF2), which becomes inactive in its phosphorylated form. In anoxic cardiomyocytes, AMPK activation was associated with an inhibition of protein synthesis and an increase in phosphorylation of eEF2. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), did not mimic the effect of oxygen deprivation to inhibit protein synthesis in cardiomyocytes or lead to eEF2 phosphorylation in perfused hearts, suggesting that AMPK activation did not inhibit mTOR/p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) signaling. Human recombinant eEF2 kinase (eEF2K) was phosphorylated by AMPK in a time- and AMP-dependent fashion, and phosphorylation led to eEF2K activation, similar to that observed in extracts from ischemic hearts. In contrast, increasing the workload resulted in a dephosphorylation of eEF2, which was rapamycin-insensitive, thus excluding a role for mTOR in this effect. eEF2K activity was unchanged by increasing the workload, suggesting that the decrease in eEF2 phosphorylation could result from the activation of an eEF2 phosphatase.

Protein synthesis, in particular peptide chain elongation, is an energy-consuming biosynthetic process, accounting for a large proportion of the oxygen requirements of cells (1Buttergeit F. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Protein synthesis is regulated via the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of translation factors and ribosomal proteins (2Proud C.G. Curr. Top. Cell.

Abraham R.T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 345-349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The control of translation by mTOR is also exerted at elongation by regulating the phosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF2) (4Wang X. Li W. Williams M. Terada N. Alessi D.R. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4370-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of eEF2 at Thr-56 by a specific calcium- and calmodulin-dependent eukaryotic eEF2 kinase (eEF2K) leads to its inactivation (5Redpath N.T. Price N.T. Severinov K.V. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) lies downstream of mTOR and phosphorylates Ser-366 of eEF2K, causing inactivation (4Wang X. Li W. Williams M. Terada N. Alessi D.R. Proud C.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4370-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Therefore, mTOR activation can result in a stimulation of protein synthesis by decreasing eEF2 phosphorylation. Indeed, one of the mechanisms by which insulin stimulates protein synthesis in the heart involves mTOR activation, the effect being blocked by the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, and by wortmannin, which blocks phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) upstream of mTOR (6Wang L. Wang X. Proud C.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1056-H1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulation of protein synthesis by insulin also involves a mTOR-independent mechanism via the phosphorylation and inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase-3. Glycogen synthase kinase-3 phosphorylates and inactivates the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) (7Wang X. Janmaatt M. Beugnet A. Paulin F.E. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 475-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).Increasing the workload of heart stimulates protein synthesis, leading to cardiac hypertrophy (8Kira Y. Kochel P.J. Gordon E.E. Morgan H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: C247-C258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The stretch of the ventricular wall could be the mechanical trigger for this effect. Therefore, protein synthesis plays an important role in the adaptation of cell size and myofibrillar content to mechanical stress. However, the signal transduction pathway leading to the stimulation of protein synthesis due to an increased workload is unknown. Like insulin, increasing the workload stimulates glycolysis via a wortmannin-sensitive pathway (9Lefebvre V. Méchin M.-C. Louckx M.P. Rider M.H. Hue L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22289-22292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 10Beauloye C. Marsin A.-S. Bertrand L. Vanoverschelde J.-L. Rider M.H. Hue L. FEBS Lett. 2002; 531: 324-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Activation of PI 3-kinase and mTOR could therefore be implicated in the stimulation of protein synthesis by increasing the workload, which was one of the aspects studied in this report.In contrast to insulin and increased workload, oxygen deprivation inhibits protein synthesis (11Jefferson L.S.

Cardiology. 1971; 56: 48-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar).

AMPK acts as an energy and nutrient sensor in cells and is activated by an increased AMP:ATP ratio, as occurs in the absence of oxygen or in response to other cellular stresses (14Hardie D.G.

Human GST·eEF2K (1.5 μg) was incubated with AMPK (1 unit/ml) and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]MgATP (specific radioactivity, 1000 cpm/pmol) in a final volume of 50 μl at 30 °C in the presence and absence of 0.2 mm AMP. At the indicated times, aliquots (5 μl) were removed for SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging for the measurement of 32P incorporation. Heart extracts or human recombinant GST·eEF2K were assayed for eEF2K activity at 30 °C in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Hepes-Tris-Mes (pH 7), 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2% (v/v) glycerol with 4.14, 1.625, or 0.23 mm CaCl2/5 mm EGTA to give free Ca2+ concentrations of 1 μm, 100 nm, or 10 nm, respectively, at pH 7, and 10 μg/ml calmodulin, 70 pmol purified eEF2, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]MgATP (specific radioactivity, 1000 cpm/pmol) in a final volume of 50 μl. After 5 min, the reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer for SDS-PAGE in gels containing 10% (w/v) acrylamide. 32P incorporation was calculated by phosphorimaging the dried gels. One unit of protein kinase activity corresponds to the formation of one nmol/min under the conditions of the various assays.Immunoblotting—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The percentage of acrylamide used for the gels depended on the protein under study. Acrylamide concentrations were 15% (w/v) for 4E-BP1, 12% (w/v) for eIF2α and ERK1/2, and 10% (w/v) for eEF2 and eIF2B. The membranes were probed with the relevant primary antibodies, and immunoreactive bands were detected with protein G-peroxidase by enhanced chemiluminescence.Phosphorylation Site Identification by Mass Spectrometry—Phosphorylated bands corresponding to the GST·eEF2K (M r 119000) were cut from Coomassie Blue-stained gels, concentrated, and digested with 1 μg of sequencing grade trypsin as described (20Woods A.

Protein synthesis was inhibited 48% by anoxia and 22% by oligomycin treatment, and there was an inverse relationship between the rates of protein synthesis and AMPK activation (Fig. 1A). Incubation of cardiomyocytes under anoxic conditions increased the phosphorylation state of Thr-56 of eEF2, the effect of anoxia being more pronounced than that of oligomycin (Fig. 1B), in line with the extent of AMPK activation.Ischemia and Anoxia Increase eEF2 Phosphorylation in Langendorff-perfused Rat Hearts—Similarly, in Langendorff-perfused rat hearts, no-flow ischemia and anoxia induced AMPK activation (Fig. 1C) and an increase in eEF2 phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). Phosphorylation of eEF2 was detectable within 2 min and was maximal between 5 and 10 min of no-flow ischemia and correlated with AMPK activation (not shown). The phosphorylation states of initiation factors 4E-BP1 and eIF2α, initiation factors that are also known to be regulated by phosphorylation, were unchanged under anoxia or ischemia for 10 min (not shown).Rapamycin Has No Effect on the Rate of Protein Synthesis and eEF2 Phosphorylation in Rat Cardiomyocytes and Langendorff-perfused Rat Hearts—In isolated cardiomyocytes, rapamycin inhibited mTOR as it blocked Thr-389 phosphorylation of p70S6K induced by a mixture of insulin (0.1 μm), leucine (1 mm), and glutamine (10 mm) (Fig. 2A). The phosphorylation of Thr-389 of p70S6K by mTOR is required for its activation (24Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Zhang A. Combs M.J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16621-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Rapamycin did not mimic the effect of oxygen deprivation to inhibit protein synthesis in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 2C), suggesting that this inhibition did not result from a reduction in mTOR/p70S6K signaling. Moreover, the level of eEF2 phosphorylation in ischemic-perfused hearts was unaffected by rapamycin, although there was a small increase in eEF2 phosphorylation in the controls (Fig. 2B). The failure of rapamycin to inhibit basal protein synthesis, despite a slight increase in eEF2 phosphorylation, indicates that the mTOR/p70S6K pathway was not active and could not be implicated in the control of eEF2 phosphorylation under these conditions.Fig. 2Effect of rapamycin on p70S6K activation, eEF2 phosphorylation, and basal protein synthesis. Cardiomyocytes were preincubated for 10 min in the presence of 250 nm rapamycin and treated with or without a mixture of insulin (0.1 μm), leucine (1 mm), and glutamine (10 mm) for 30 min. In A, extracts (50 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted (IB) with anti-phospho (Thr-389) p70S6K antibody (upper panel). The membrane was stripped and probed with anti-full-length antibody that does not distinguish the phosphorylated protein (lower panel). In B, eEF2 phosphorylation was assessed in Langendorff-perfused hearts submitted to no-flow ischemia for 10 min in the presence or absence of rapamycin 250 nm. In C, protein synthesis was measured in cardiomyocytes as described in the legend for Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)AMPK Phosphorylates and Activates eEF2K—The upstream kinase that phosphorylates Thr-56 of eEF2 is a highly specific calcium-and-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase called eEF2K (5Redpath N.T. Price N.T. Severinov K.V. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). When measured in the presence of calcium, eEF2K was activated 3-fold in extracts prepared from isolated Langendorff-perfused rat hearts subjected to 10 min of no-flow ischemia (Fig. 3A). However, in the absence of calcium, some eEF2K activity was detectable, as observed in crude extracts from certain cells (25Diggle T.A. Redpath N.T. Heesom K.J. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Recombinant human GST·eEF2K was phosphorylated by AMPK in a time- and AMP-dependent fashion to a stoichiometry of 0.7 mol of phosphate incorporated per mol of enzyme (Fig. 3B). Phosphorylation resulted in a 2–2.5-fold increase in eEF2K activity that was restricted to the total activity measured in the presence of calcium (Fig. 3C). In an attempt to identify phosphorylation sites, GST·eEF2K was maximally phosphorylated with AMPK and [γ-32P]MgATP. Following SDS-PAGE, bands corresponding to eEF2K were digested with trypsin, and the resulting peptides were separated by reverse-phase HPLC. A radioactive peak was detected, and its labeling was increased by AMP (not shown). Analysis of the labeled peak by nano-ESI-MS/MS allowed the identification of Ser-78 as one phosphorylation site for AMPK in the fragmentation spectrum of the phosphopeptide 69YSSSGSPANpSFHFK82, where “p” represents the phosphorylated residue (not shown).Fig. 3Effect of AMPK on eEF2K activity. In A, eEF2K was assayed in extracts (15 μg) from Langendorff-perfused hearts as described under “Materials and Methods” in the presence or absence of Ca2+ at pH 7. The values are the means ± S.E. from at least three different hearts. In B, GST·human eEF2K (1.5 μg) was incubated with AMPK (1 unit/ml) and [γ-32P]MgATP (specific radioactivity 1000 cpm/pmol) in a final volume of 50 μl at 30 °C in the presence and absence of 0.2 mm AMP. At the indicated times, aliquots (5 μl) were removed for SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging for measurement of 32P incorporation. In C, GST·human eEF2K (1.5 μg) was incubated with 0.2 mm AMP and 1 mm MgATP in a final volume of 25 μl for 20 min at 30 °C in the presence or absence of AMPK (1 unit/ml). Aliquots (2.5 μl) were assayed for eEF2K activity for 5 min in reaction mixtures at the indicated Ca2+ concentrations at pH 7 as described under “Materials and Methods.” The results are the means of three separate determinations. *, a statistically significant difference with respect to the controls (p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Regulation of eEF2 Phosphorylation by Anoxia under Working Conditions—Since eEF2K is a Ca2+-dependent protein kinase, basal eEF2 phosphorylation could be different in a model of isolated working heart, in which a higher calcium transient has been observed. Therefore, isolated working hearts were perfused with an afterload of 100 cm of H2O and a preload of 20 cm of H2O (physiological conditions) under normoxia and were then submitted to anoxia. Heart function was monitored continuously with a pressure transducer, indicating a drop in aortic pressure within the first minutes of anoxia (Fig. 4A). After 5 min of anoxia, AMPK was maximally activated about 4-fold (Fig. 4B), and at 10 min of anoxia, the AMP/ATP ratio was increased 2–3-fold (Fig. 4C), whereas the PCr/Cr ratio was reduced by about 30% (Fig. 4D). An increase in eEF2 phosphorylation was observed after 5 and 10 min of anoxia (Fig. 4E) as in unloaded hearts (Fig. 1D).Fig. 4Effect of anoxia on AMP/ATP, PCr/Cr ratio, AMPK activity, and eEF2 phosphorylation in isolated working hearts. Hearts were perfused at 100 cm of H2O afterload and 20 cm of H2O preload. After 20 min of equilibration, hearts were submitted to anoxia by changing the gas phase (95% N2, 5% CO2) for 10 min. In A, the aortic pressure recording from a representative experiment is shown. Hearts were freeze-clamped at the indicated times for measurement of AMPK activity (B) and for the determination of the intracellular AMP/ATP (C) and PCr/Cr (D) concentration ratios. The values are the means ± S.E. for at least five hearts. *, a statistically significant difference with respect to the controls (p < 0.05).

IB, immunoblot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)eEF2 Is Dephosphorylated during Increased Heart Work—In perfused working hearts, we also studied the effects of increased heart work on eEF2 phosphorylation, as this condition is known to increase protein synthesis (8Kira Y. Kochel P.J. Gordon E.E. Morgan H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: C247-C258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Heart work was increased by raising the afterload from 60 (low load) to 120 cm of H2O (high load). In contrast to anoxia, an acute increase in pressure load resulted in a decrease in eEF2 phosphorylation, which occurred within 1 min and persisted over 15 min (Fig. 5A). This could explain the increase in protein synthesis in response to an increased workload (8Kira Y. Kochel P.J. Gordon E.E. Morgan H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: C247-C258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as eEF2 phosphorylation inhibits protein synthesis. The effect of increasing the workload to dephosphorylate eEF2 was unaffected by wortmannin and rapamycin (Fig. 6A), which are inhibitors of PI 3-kinase and mTOR respectively. Surprisingly, Thr-389 phosphorylation of p70S6K was also decreased under high load conditions, suggesting that mTOR was inhibited (Fig. 6B). This contrasts with the situation in rat cardiomyocytes treated with insulin, in which p70S6K is activated and protein synthesis is stimulated, both effects being blocked by rapamycin (6Wang L. Wang X. Proud C.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H1056-H1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 2A). No significant decrease in eEF2K activity was observed after 15 min of high load (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the decrease in eEF2 phosphorylation might be due to the activation of an eEF2 phosphatase. Taken together, these results show a decrease in eEF2 phosphorylation in response to increasing the workload, for which mTOR/p70S6K does not seem to play a role.Fig. 5Effect of increased heart work on eEF2 phosphorylation and eEF2K activity. Hearts were perfused at 60 cm of H2O for 15 min, submitted to an acute increase in afterload (120 cm of H2O), and freeze-clamped at the indicated times.

Wortmannin or rapamycin was added to the perfusion medium after 5 min of equilibration at final concentrations of 100 and 250 nm, respectively. Me2SO was the control vehicle. In A and C, eEF2 and 4E-BP1 (Thr-36 and Thr-45) phosphorylation were assessed in extracts (50 μg) as described in the legend for Fig. 1. IB, immunoblot.

The anti-phospho antibody used in these experiments recognizes Thr-36 and probably cross-reacts with Thr-45 (the surrounding sequences are almost identical). However, there was no change in eIF2α phosphorylation state (not shown). In a previous study, we showed that the stimulation of glycolysis by increasing the workload, like the metabolic effects of insulin, were wortmannin-sensitive and did not require AMPK (10Beauloye C.

https://openalex.org/W2059036105,"In most neurodegenerative disorders, including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease, a massive neuronal cell death occurs as a consequence of an uncontrolled inflammatory response, where activated microglia and its cytotoxic agents play a crucial pathologic role. Because current treatments for these diseases are not effective, several regulatory molecules termed ""microglia-deactivating factors"" recently have been the focus of considerable research. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neuropeptide with a potent anti-inflammatory effect, which has been found to protect from other inflammatory disorders, such as endotoxic shock and rheumatoid arthritis. In the present study, we investigate the effect of VIP on inflammation-mediated neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo as well as on the putative neuroprotective effect of VIP on experimental pathological conditions in which central nervous system (CNS) inflammation is involved, such as brain trauma. The involvement of activated microglia and their derived cytotoxic products is also studied. VIP has a clear neuroprotective effect on inflammatory conditions by inhibiting the production of microglia-derived proinflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1beta, nitric oxide). In this sense, VIP prevents neuronal cell death following brain trauma by reducing the inflammatory response of neighboring microglia. Therefore, VIP emerges as a valuable neuroprotective agent for the treatment of pathologic conditions of the CNS where inflammation-induced neurodegeneration occurs."
https://openalex.org/W2109158057,"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear receptor family that plays a critical role in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism. Here we report for the first time that PPARgamma is expressed in human renal cortical collecting ducts (CCD), segments of the nephor involved in regulation of sodium and water homeostasis via action of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). ENaC activity is regulated by the hormones aldosterone and insulin, primarily through co-ordinate actions on serum and glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1 (SGK1). We show that SGK1 activity is stimulated by treatment of a human CCD cell line with PPARgamma agonists, paralleled by an increase in SGK1 mRNA that is abolished by pretreatment with a specific PPARgamma antagonist, and that this leads to increased levels of cell surface ENaCalpha. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that these effects are caused by binding of PPARgamma to a specific response element in the SGK1 promoter. Our results identify SGK1 as a target for PPARgamma and suggest a novel role for PPARgamma in regulation of sodium re-absorption in the CCD via stimulation of ENaC activity. This pathway may play a role in sodium retention caused by activation of PPARgamma in man."
https://openalex.org/W2003531759,"To better understand the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids, which likely plays a key role in a variety of cell functions, in Entamoeba histolytica, we searched the genome data base for genes encoding putative orthologs of enzymes known to be involved in the metabolism. The search revealed that E. histolytica possesses only incomplete cysteine-methionine conversion pathways in both directions. Instead, this parasite possesses genes encoding two isoenzymes of methionine γ-lyase (EC 4.4.1.11, EhMGL1/2), which has been implicated in the degradation of sulfur-containing amino acids. The two amebic MGL isoenzymes, showing 69% identity to each other, encode 389- and 392-amino acid polypeptides with predicted molecular masses of 42.3 and 42.7 kDa and pIs of 6.01 and 6.63, respectively. Amino acid comparison and phylogenetic analysis suggested that these amebic MGLs are likely to have been horizontally transferred from the Archaea, whereas an MGL from another anaerobic protist Trichomonas vaginalis has MGL isotypes that share a common ancestor with bacteria. Enzymological and immunoblot analyses of the partially purified native amebic MGL confirmed that both of the MGL isotypes are expressed in a comparable amount predominantly in the cytosol and form a homotetramer. Recombinant EhMGL1 and 2 proteins catalyzed degradation of l-methionine, dl-homocysteine, l-cysteine, and O-acetyl-l-serine to form α-keto acid, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide or methanethiol, whereas activity toward cystathionine was negligible. These two isoenzymes showed notable differences in substrate specificity and pH optimum. In addition, we showed that EhMGL is an ideal target for the development of new chemotherapeutic agents against amebiasis by demonstrating an amebicidal effect of the methionine analog trifluoromethionine on trophozoites in culture (IC50 18 μm) and that this effect of trifluoromethionine was completely abolished by the addition of the MGL-specific inhibitor dl-propargylglycine.

Entamoeba histolytica is a causative agent of amebiasis, which annually affects an estimated 48 million people and results in 70,000 deaths (1Behbehani K. Bull World Health Organ. 1998; 76: 64-67PubMed Google Scholar). The most common clinical presentation of amebiasis is amebic dysentery and colitis; extraintestinal abscesses, i.e. hepatic, pulmonary, and cerebral, however, are also common and often lethal. This microaerophilic anaerobe has been considered to be a unique eukaryotic organism because it apparently lacks organelles typical of eukaryotic organisms such as mitochondria, the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and the Golgi apparatus (2Ravdin, J.

In addition, recent studies suggesting the horizontal transfer of genes encoding a variety of fermentation enzymes from bacteria (9Rosenthal B. Mai Z. Caplivski D. Ghosh S. de la Vega H. Graf T.

In mammals, cysteine is produced solely from incorporated methionine and serine via S-adenosylmethionine, homocysteine, and cystathionine in a pathway called the reverse trans-sulfuration pathway.

Chem. 1999; 274: 32445-32452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) that major enzymes in this pathway, serine acetyltransferase (SAT) and cysteine synthase (CS), play a central role in the control of the intracellular cysteine concentrations, and in the antioxidative stress defense mechanism of this gluthathione-lacking parasite (8Fahey R.C. Newton G.L. Arrick B. Overdank-Bogart T. Aley S.B. Science. 1984; 224: 70-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). One important question remaining about the sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism in this parasite, and also in anaerobic protists in general, is how these parasites degrade toxic sulfur-containing amino acids since they possess apparently incomplete trans-sulfuration pathways in both the forward and reverse orientation (data not shown, see the present study). Thus, in order to better understand the metabolism, particularly degradation, of these sulfur-containing amino acids in E. histolytica, we attempted to isolate other essential genes encoding proteins involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism. We identified and characterized two isotypes of the unique enzyme, methionine γ-lyase (MGL; EC 4.4.1.11) and their encoding genes, which, we propose, function in the degradation of sulfur amino acids in this parasite. We show a line of evidence suggesting that the MGL genes and their proteins were likely derived from the Archaea by horizontal transfer as shown for other metabolic enzymes in this parasite (10Field J. Rosenthal B. Samuelson J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 446-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, we also demonstrate that the methionine analog trifluoromethionine (TFMET) has a cytotoxic effect on amebic trophozoites that is abolished by a specific inhibitor of MGL, indicating that MGL is exploitable as an attractive target for the development of new amebicidal compounds. Chemicals and Reagents—l-methionine, l-cysteine, dl-homocysteine, OAS, O-succinyl-l-homocysteine, O-acetyl-l-homoserine, dl-propargylglycine (PPG), 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazon hydrochloride, trichloroacetic acid, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), and other chemicals were commercial products of the highest purity available unless otherwise stated. TFMET was a gift from Dr. Cyrus J. Bacchi (Haskins Laboratories and Department of Biology, Pace University, New York). Microorganisms and Cultivation—Trophozoites of E. histolytica strain HM-1:IMSS cl-6 (16Diamond L.S. Mattern C.F. Bartgis I.L. J. Virol. 1972; 9: 326-341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained axenically in Diamond's BI-S-33 medium (11Diamond L.S. Harlow D.R. Cunnick C.C. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1978; 72: 431-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1565) Google Scholar) at 35.5 °C. Trophozoites were harvested at the late-logarithmic growth phase 2-3 days after inoculation of one-twelfth to one-sixth of a total culture volume. After the cultures were chilled on ice for 5 min, trophozoites were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Cell pellets were stored at -80 °C until use. Search of the Genome Data Base of E. histolytica—The E. histolytica genome data base at the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR, www.tigr.org/tdb/) was searched using the TBLASTN algorithm with protein sequences corresponding to the PLP-attachment site of cysteine- and methionine-metabolizing enzymes (PROSITE access number PS00868). This motif is conserved among the γ-subfamily (α-family) of PLP enzymes (for the classification of PLP enzymes used in this study, see Ref. 17Mehta P.K. Christen P. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 129-184PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. cystathionine γ-lyase (CGL), cystathionine γ-synthase (CGS), and cystathionine β-lyase (CBL) from a variety of organisms. We also searched for amebic orthologs that belong to the β-family of PLP enzymes using the PLP-attachment site from CS of E. histolytica and cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) from yeast and mammals. Cloning of E. histolytica MGL1 and MGL2 and Production of their Recombinant Proteins—Based on nucleotide sequences of the protein-encoding region of the two putative amebic MGL genes (EhMGL1 and EhMGL2), two sets of primers, shown below, were designed to amplify the open reading frames (ORF) of EhMGL1 and to construct plasmids to produce glutathione S-transferase (GST)-EhMGL fusion proteins. The two sense and two antisense primers contained the SmaI restriction site (underlined) either prior to the translation initiation site or next to the stop codon (bold), respectively. The primers used are: EhMGL1 (sense), 5′-CATCCCGGGGATGACTGCTCAAGATATTACTACTACT-3′ (37-mer); EhMGL1 (antisense), 5′-TAGCCCGGGATTACCAAAGCTCTAATGCTTGTTTTAA-3′ (37-mer); EhMGL2 (sense), 5′-CATCCCGGGTATGTCTCAATTGAAGGATTTACAAACA-3′ (37-mer); EhMGL2 (antisense), 5′-TAGCCCGGGATTAGCATTGTTCAAGAGCTTGTTTTAA-3′ (37-mer). The cDNA library of E. histolytica trophozoites constructed in a lambda phage (14Nozaki T. Asai T. Kobayashi S. Ikegami F. Noji M. Saito K. Takeuchi T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was used as the template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following parameters. An initial step for denaturation and rTaq (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) activation at 94 °C for 15 min was followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 45 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. A final step at 72 °C for 10 min was used to complete the extension. Approximately 1.1-kb PCR fragments were obtained and cloned into the SmaI site of a pGEX-6P-1 expression vector (Amersham Biosciences K.K., Tokyo, Japan). The final constructs were designated as pGEX6P1/MGL1 and pGEX6P1/MGL2, respectively. Nucleotide sequences were confirmed by using appropriate synthetic sequencing primers, a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit, and an ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems Japan Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), according to the manufacturer's protocol. To express the recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli, pGEX6P1/MGL1 and pGEX6P1/MGL2 were introduced into BL21 (DE3) (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI) host cells. Expression of the GST-MGL1 and GST-MGL2 fusion proteins was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside at 18 °C for 20 h. The fusion proteins were purified using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant EhMGL1/2 (rEhMGL1/2) were obtained by digestion of these fusion proteins with PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences) in the column, followed by elution from the column and dialysis at 4 °C with 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 0.02 mm PLP. The final purified recombinant EhMGL (rEhMGL) proteins were presumed to contain 10 additional amino acids (GPLGSPEFPG) at the N terminus. The purified enzymes were stored at -80 °C with 30-50% dimethyl sulfoxide until use. No decrease in enzyme activity was observed under these conditions for at least 3 months. Protein concentrations were determined by Coomassie Brilliant Blue assay (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Amino Acid Alignments and Phylogenetic Analyses—The sequences of MGL and other members of the γ-subfamily of PLP enzymes showing similarities to the amino acid sequences of EhMGL were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI, www.ncbi.nih.gov/) by using the BLASTP algorithm. The alignment and phylogenetic analyses were performed with ClustalW version 1.81 (18Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55409) Google Scholar) using the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method with the Blosum matrix. An unrooted NJ tree composed of the amino acid sequences of 13 MGLs and 10 other members of the γ-subfamily of PLP enzymes from various organisms with two EhCSs (β-family of PLP enzymes) as the outgroup was drawn by Tree View ver.1.6.0 (19Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Branch lengths and bootstrap values (1000 replicates) were derived from the NJ analysis. Phylogenetic analyses by the maximum parsimony method (MP) and maximum likelihood method (ML) were also conducted using PROTPARS (PHYLIP version 3.57c, Ref. 20Kuhner M.K. Felsenstein J. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1994; 11: 459-468PubMed Google Scholar) and ProtML (MOLPHY version 2.3, Ref. 21Adachi J. Hasegawa M. Computer Science Monographs, Institute of Statistical Mathematics. 28. Tokyo, Japan1996: 1-150Google Scholar), respectively. Subcellular Fractionation of the Crude Extract—The lysate of ∼3 × 106 E. histolytica trophozoites was prepared by two cycles of freezing and thawing in 1 ml of cell lysis buffer: 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.02 mm PLP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science, Tokyo, Japan), and 1 μg/ml of N-(3-carboxyoxirane-2-carbonyl)-leucyl-amino(4-guanido)butane (E-64, Sigma). The whole lysate was then centrifuged at 14,000 × g in a microcentrifuge tube for 20 min at 4 °C to separate the supernatant (soluble cytosolic fraction) and the pellet (debris, membrane, and nuclear fraction). Anion Exchange Chromatography of the Native Form MGLs—A supernatant fraction obtained from 2 g (wet weight) of the trophozoite pellet, as described above, was filtered with a 0.45-μm-pore mixed cellulose membrane (Millex-HA, Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). The sample buffer was exchanged with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.02 mm PLP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 μg/ml of E-64) by using a Centricon Plus-20 (Millipore). A 20-ml sample containing ∼100 mg of total protein was loaded on a DEAE-Toyopearl HW-650S column (7.5 × 1.6 cm, 15-ml bed volume, Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) that was previously equilibrated with buffer A. The column was further washed with ∼50 ml of buffer A until the A 280 dropped below 0.1. The bound proteins were then eluted with a 50-ml linear potassium chloride gradient (0-0.5 m) in buffer A at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. All 0.8-ml fractions were concentrated to 0.2 ml with a Centricon YM-10 (Millipore). All procedures were performed at 4 °C. The amount of MGL in each fraction was assessed using the hydrogen sulfide assay and immunoblotting as described below. Size Exclusion Chromatography of Recombinant and Native EhMGLs—To estimate the molecular mass of the recombinant and native EhMGLs, gel filtration chromatography was performed. Approximately 500 μg of recombinant and 100 μg of partially purified native EhMGL were dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.02 mm PLP, and 0.2 m KCl) and concentrated to 1 ml with the Centricon Plus-20. The concentrated samples were then applied to a column of Toyopearl HW-65S (70 × 1.6 cm, 140-ml bed volume, Tosoh) preequilibrated with buffer B. The recombinant and native MGLs were eluted with buffer B at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The peaks were detected by measuring absorbance at A 280 (recombinant MGLs) and immunoblotting (native MGLs). The same column was calibrated with blue dextran (2000 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and aldolase (158 kDa) (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblot Anaylsis—Polyclonal antisera against recombinant EhMGL1 and 2 were raised in rabbits by Sigma-Genosys (Hokkaido, Japan). Immunoblot analysis was carried out using a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane as described in (22Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 3rd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 18.62-18.74Google Scholar). The blot membrane was visualized by using alkaline phosphatase conjugate-coupled secondary antibody with NBT/BCIP solution (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two-dimensional Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—First-dimensional electrofocusing of two-dimensional PAGE was performed using Immobiline Drystrip, pH 3-10 NL, 7 cm and IPG Buffer pH 3-10 NL (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Second dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 12% SDS-PAGE gel using prestained SDS-PAGE standards, Broad Range (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Tokyo, Japan), as a molecular marker. Enzyme Assays and Kinetic Calculations—The enzymatic activitiy of MGL was monitored by measuring the production of α-keto acid, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide or methanethiol. The standard MGL reaction was performed in 200 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, a reaction mixture containing 0.02 mm PLP, and 0.1-10 mm of each substrate with appropriate amounts of each enzyme. The α-keto acid assay was performed as described (23Soda K. Agr. Biol. Chem. 1967; 31: 1054-1060Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The MGL reaction was terminated by adding 25 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid. After the proteins were precipitated by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, 100 μl of the supernatant was mixed with 200 μl of 0.5 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, and 80 μl of 0.1% of 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone hydrazon hydrochloride, and then incubated at 50 °C for 30 min. After the mixture had cooled to room temperature, absorbance at A 320 was measured. Pyruvic acid and 2-α-butyric acid were used as standards. For the detection of ammonia, the nitrogen assay (24Thompson J.F. Morrison G.R. Anal. Chem. 1951; 23: 1153-1157Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was used. A 50-μl sample of the supernatant, as for the α-keto acid assay, was mixed with 50 μl of Nessler's reagent (Nakalai) and 75 μl of 2 n sodium hydroxide, and then incubated at 25 °C for 15 min. Absorbance at A 440 was measured. Ammonium sulfate was used as a standard. The hydrogen sulfide assay was performed as described (25Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1965; 11: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 26Schneider D. Jaschkowitz K. Seidler A. Rogner M. Indian J. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 37: 441-446PubMed Google Scholar, 27Jaschkowitz K. Seidler A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3416-3423Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, the MGL reaction was terminated by adding 20 μl of 20 mm N,N-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine sulfate in 7.2 n HCl and 20 μl of 30 mm FeCl3 in 1.2 n HCl. After further incubation in the dark for 20 min, the proteins were precipitated by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and then the absorption at OD650 of the supernatant was measured to quantitate the formed methylene blue. Na2S was used as a standard. The methanethiol assay was performed as described (28Laakso S. Nurmikko V. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 600-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) using 5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid). One-hundred microliters of the sample supernatant were mixed with 1 μl of 100 mm 5,5′-dithio-bis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) in ethanol, and after 2 min incubation at room temperature, absorbance at A 412 was measured. l-cysteine was used as a standard. The cysteine and cystathionine assay was performed as described (29Kashiwamata S. Greenberg D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 212: 488-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The ninhydrin reagent was prepared by dissolving 1 g of ninhydrin in 100 ml of glacial acetic acid and adding 33 ml of glacial phosphoric acid. For the determination of cystathionine, 0.2 ml of cystathionine-containing solution was mixed with 0.33 ml of the ninhydrin reagent and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. The solution was then cooled on ice for 2 min and at room temperature for a further 10 min. Absorbance at A 455 was measured. Cysteine concentrations were determined using the same protocol except for the measurement of absorbance at A 560. Kinetic parameters were estimated with Lineweaver-Burk plots using Sigma Plot 2000 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) with the Enzyme Kinetics module (version 6.0, Hulinks, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). Assay of the Inhibition of rEhMGL by dl-Propargylglycine—An α-keto acid assay (described above) with l-methionine as the substrate was performed to evaluate the inhibitory effects of dl-propargylglycine (PPG) on the activity of rEhMGLs. rEhMGL (5 μg) was preincubated with various concentrations of PPG in the standard MGL reaction mixtures (described above) in the absence of l-methionine at 36 °C. The preincubation time was 5 min for kinetic analyses and 1 to 60 min to characterize the slow binding of this inhibitor. After preincubation, the reaction was initiated by adding an appropriate amount of l-methionine to the reaction mixture. In Vitro Assessment of Amebicidal Reagents—To assess the amebicidal effect of TFMET, the trophozoites were cultured in the BI-S-33 medium containing various concentrations of TFMET or metronidazole, the therapeutic compound commonly used for amebiasis, as a control. After cultivation at 35.5 °C for 18 h, cell survival was assessed with the cell proliferation reagent WST-1 (Roche Applied Science). Briefly, the trophozoites were seeded on 96-well microtiter plates in 200 μl of BI-S-33 medium at a density of 2 × 104 cells per well (1 × 105 cells/ml), and the lid was completely sealed with a sterilized adhesive silicon sheet (Corning, New York). After these plates were further incubated at 35.5 °C for 18 h, 20 μl of WST-1 reagent was added to each well and the incubation was continued for 2 more hours. The optical density at A 445 was measured with that at A 595 as a reference using a microplate reader (Model 550, Bio-Rad, Tokyo, Japan). The initial density and incubation period of the cultures were chosen to maintain the control trophozoites in the late-logarithmic growth phase throughout the experiment, and also to allow the measurement of optical density in the linear portion of the curves (between 4 × 103 to 2.0 × 105 cells/ml). Data Base Search of the PLP-dependent Enzymes—In an attempt to obtain genes encoding the PLP-dependent enzymes involved in the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids, we searched the genome data base for putative proteins that possessed a conserved PLP-binding domain as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two independent contigs were found in the genome data base. These contigs (Contig 315785 and 316820, TIGR) contained two similar but not identical ORFs that encode proteins possessing a region containing the PLP-binding motif of the γ-subfamily of PLP enzymes. Non-coding flanking regions within these contigs also showed significant variations (data not shown). All other contigs or singletons showing significant identity to these two contigs perfectly overlapped them, which is consistent with the notion that these fragments are present as a single copy in the genome. We also searched for genes containing the PLP-binding site of the β-family of PLP enzymes using both the amebic CS and the yeast and mammalian CBS. However, after eliminating contigs and singletons that contain genes encoding the two CS isotypes described previously (14Nozaki T. Asai T. Kobayashi S. Ikegami F. Noji M. Saito K. Takeuchi T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 97: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), no contig or singleton was found to contain this motif. This suggests that E. histolytica possesses two uncharacterized genes encoding proteins that belong to the γ-subfamily of PLP enzymes, and lacks the β-family of PLP enzymes (i.e. CBS) known to be involved in the reverse trans-sulfuration pathway in other organisms. We also tentatively concluded that the trans-sulfuration sequences in both the forward and reverse orientation are incomplete since the amebic genome lacks putative genes for CBL, CGS, and CGL (also see below). In addition, the major pathways for cysteine degradation of sulfur amino acids present in mammals, i.e. the cysteine sulfinic acid (cysteine dioxygenase as a key enzyme), 4′-phosphopanthetheine (leading to synthesis of coenzyme A and cysteamine), and mitochondrial mercaptopyruvate pathways, are apparently absent in this organism (data not"

Programmed cell death (apoptosis) is indispensable for all multicellular organisms in normal development and tissue homeostasis (1Ellis R.E. Yuan J.Y. Horvitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar, 2Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar). Excessive apoptosis leads to disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases, whereas diseases such as cancer arise from insufficient apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 3Rathmell J.C. Thompson C.B. Annu. Rev. Imunol. 1999; 17: 781-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar and 4Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). The apoptotic process involves an intricate cascade of events, which is classified as occurring in two major pathways. The extrinsic pathway relies on a cell surface stimulus and is initiated by binding of death ligands to death receptors or by granzyme B. The intrinsic pathway occurs as a consequence of cellular stress and is mediated by the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrion. Because the mitochondrion-dependent pathway is also employed as an amplification loop for the death receptor pathway, the terms “extrinsic” and “intrinsic” are used here strictly according to the origin of the death signals, indicating extracellular or intracellular initiation of apoptosis, respectively. Caspase-2 was discovered as the first mammalian apoptotic caspase (5Wang L. Miura M. Bergeron L. Zhu H. Yuan J. Cell. 1994; 78: 739-750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that caspase-2 is engaged as an initiator in both the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. Additionally, caspase-2 serves in neuronal cells both as the default initiator and the default executioner caspase (reviewed in Ref. 6Troy C.M. Shelanski M.L. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The first function described for caspase-2 is that of an initiator of the extrinsic pathway, thereby mediating external death signals to the cellular apoptotic machinery. Upon binding of a death ligand to the death receptors, the adaptor molecule RAIDD (RIP-associated Ich-1/CED-3 homologous protein with death domain, also known as CRADD) is recruited intracellularly, followed by binding of procaspase-2 via its N-terminal CARD 1The abbreviations used are: CARD, caspase-associated recruitment domain; Apaf-1, apoptotic protease activating factor-1; Ac-LDESD-cho, acetyl-LeuAsp-Glu-Ser-Asp-aldehyde; Ac-DEVD-cmk, acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-chloromethylketone; amc, 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin; Ich-1, interleukin-1β-converting enzyme and CED3 homologue; DTT, dithiothreitol; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Chaps, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: CARD, caspase-associated recruitment domain; Apaf-1, apoptotic protease activating factor-1; Ac-LDESD-cho, acetyl-LeuAsp-Glu-Ser-Asp-aldehyde; Ac-DEVD-cmk, acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-chloromethylketone; amc, 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin; Ich-1, interleukin-1β-converting enzyme and CED3 homologue; DTT, dithiothreitol; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Chaps, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. domain (7Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In this complex, caspase-2 is activated via proteolytic cleavage, releasing the active protease to the cytoplasm. Unlike all other initiators, caspase-2 is completely inactive toward other caspase zymogens (8Guo Y. Srinivasula S.M. Druilhe A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13430-13437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Instead, the protease cleaves cytosolic Bid, which leads to an increase of the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. As a consequence, cytochrome c is released to the cytoplasm and assembles with procaspase-9 and Apaf-1 to form the apoptosome, leading to caspase-9 activation and eventually to programmed cell death. More recently, caspase-2 was also found to be the apical initiator caspase of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, which is activated during cell stress (8Guo Y. Srinivasula S.M. Druilhe A.

Both the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways engage the same proteolytic cascade, but the mechanism of caspase-2 activation is different. Unlike in the extrinsic pathway, the molecular basis for the activation of caspase-2 as a consequence of cell stress remains obscure. The importance of caspase-2 in the intrinsic pathway, however, becomes increasingly evident: caspase-2 activation is crucial in chemotherapy-induced cell death, as shown for acute myeloid and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (12Faderl S. Thall P.F. Kantarjian H.M. Talpaz M. Harris D. Van Q. Beran M. Kornblau S.M. Pierce S. Estrov Z. Clin. Cancer Res. 1999; 5: 4041-4047PubMed Google Scholar), caspase-2 is activated in response to the chemotherapeutic drug etoposide (10Robertson J.D. Enoksson M. Suomela M. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29803-29809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and can mediate apoptosis in human breast cancer cell lines (13Sevignani C. Calin G.A. Cesari R. Sarti M. Ishii H. Yendamuri S. Vecchione A. Trapasso F. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1183-1187PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, caspase-2 is most closely related to the Caenorhabditis elegans CED-3 of all mammalian caspases and is the most evolutionarily conserved caspase within the family (14Lamkanfi M. Declercq W. Kalai M. Saelens X. Vandenabeele P. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). However, based on the lack of a dramatic phenotype in the caspase-2 null mouse (15Bergeron L. Perez G.I. Macdonald G. Shi L. Sun Y. Jurisicova A. Varmuza S. Latham K.E. Flaws J.A. Salter J.C. Hara H. Moskowitz M.A. Li E. Greenberg A. Tilly J.L. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1304-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that the protease is the sole mediator of cell stress signals. Probably, cell stress-dependent and developmental apoptosis can be ignited by caspase-2 and by other initiators, which act in a redundant manner (16Marsden V.S. O'Connor L. O'Reilly L.A. Silke J. Metcalf D. Ekert P.G. Huang D.C. Cecconi F. Kuida K. Tomaselli K.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Vaux D.L. Bouillet P. Adams J.M. Strasser A. Nature. 2002; 419: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). All caspases show a high degree of specificity with an absolute requirement for cleavage after an aspartic acid residue and a recognition sequence of normally four consecutive amino acids N-terminal to the cleavage site. Using a combinatorial approach they have been classified into three distinct specificity groups: group I (caspases-1, -4, and -5) with preference for Trp-Glu-His-Asp, group II (caspases-2, -3, and -7) with a preference for Asp-Glu-X-Asp and group III (caspases-6, -8, -9, and -10) with a preference for (Leu/Val)-Glu-X-Asp (17Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1834) Google Scholar). This characteristic specificity is crucial to the apoptotic process, because it involves cleavage of a particular group of proteins in an ordered manner rather than indiscriminate proteolysis (18Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). Given their pivotal role in the regulation of apoptosis, the caspases are important therapeutic targets, and it is evident that further investigation of caspase specificity and its relationship to structure is important for understanding cell death. A number of neurological diseases are connected to the caspase apoptotic pathway (19Braun J.S. Novak R. Herzog K.H. Bodner S.M. Cleveland J.L. Tuomanen E.I. Nat.

A possible strategy could involve the design of compounds that specifically promote dimerization of monomeric caspase zymogens. Caspase-2 Production—Expression and purification were based on protocols previously described for a set of caspases (17Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

Thornberry N.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), however, several modifications were introduced. The cloned genes for the large p19 (Met-Ala-Asn150-Asp316) and the small p12 subunit (Met-Ala331-Thr435) were inserted in the NcoI/BamHI sites of pET11d plasmids (Novagen). For separate expression of both subunits, Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene), containing one of the two plasmids were grown to a density of A 600 = 0.6 at 37 °C in a 0.5-liter Luria-Bertani medium. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) was added, and the culture was shaken at 37 °C for 2.5 h. Under these conditions, the subunits were localized in the inclusion body fraction where they constituted more than 90% of the total protein. Cells were harvested, washed in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and broken using a French press. Inclusion bodies were sedimented, washed, and solubilized as described previously (17Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

For refolding, equimolar amounts of each subunit were combined and rapidly diluted to a final concentration of ∼100 μg of subunit/ml. As refolding buffer, 200 ml of 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20% sucrose, and 10 mm DTT was used. Refolding was achieved overnight at 20 °C under nitrogen. Precipitate was removed by centrifugation (5,000 × g, 20 min), and the supernatant was concentrated 25-fold using an Amicon-stirred cell (membrane: PLGC 10,000). To reduce the salt concentration, the protein solution was diluted 1:4 with 7.5% (w/v) sucrose, 4 mm DTT prior to chromatography. Active enzyme was separated from inactive subunits by anion-exchange chromatography using a MonoQ 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.35, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 4 mm DTT. A further 4 mm DTT was added to all fractions immediately after chromatography. Fractions containing pure and active caspase-2 were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration to a final concentration of 1.2-2 mg/ml (yield, 5-8 mg/liter medium). The protease was subsequently inhibited with a 2-fold molar excess of Ac-LDESD-cho (Calbiochem). Analytical Methods—Protein concentration was determined by absorbance spectroscopy at 280 nm using the theoretical extinction coefficient (ϵ280 = 17,930 m-1cm-1) and with the Advanced Protein Assay from cytoskeleton. Amino acid analysis was performed using an amino acid analyzer (AminoQuant, Hewlett-Packard) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. All three methods yielded comparable results. SDS-PAGE was performed on 15% or 18% acrylamide gels in a Tris/glycine system. Analytical size exclusion chromatography was performed at 4 °C using an Amersham Biosciences Superdex 200 HR10/30 column equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) sucrose. The enzyme (concentration: 8-10 μm; active and irreversibly inhibited with Ac-DEVD-cmk) was chromatographed in the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The elution volume was compared with a standard curve of the column calibrated with molecular weight markers and with active and inhibited caspase-8 using the same elution buffer described above. Enzymatic Assay—The enzymatic activity of caspase-2 was determined using Ac-DEVD-amc and Ac-LDESD-amc in 100 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 10% polyethylene glycol 400, 0.1% Chaps, 10 mm DTT (27Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. METHODS: A Companion to Methods Enzymol. 1999; 17: 313-319Crossref Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was detected at λex = 360 nm and λem = 465 nm for 20 min at room temperature using an HTS 7000 Plus Bio Assay Reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For relative (V max/K m) determinations, all substrate concentrations were first measured by amino acid analysis and then adjusted to a final concentration of 17.6 μm; the active enzyme was diluted to a final concentration of 200 nm. Mass Spectrometry—Prior to mass spectrometry, p19 of the uninhibited enzyme was separated from p12 by high-performance liquid chromatography using a C8 reverse phase column (Vydac), 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O as buffer A, 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile as buffer B, and a gradient from 20 to 100% B. The fractions were directly analyzed by mass spectrometry using a Bruker Biflex MALDI spectrometer and α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. To examine the reduced species, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 4 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride was added prior to the analysis. Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of the caspase-2/LDESD complex were obtained by sitting drop vapor diffusion at 4 °C by mixing 1.5 μl of protein solution (in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 8 mm DTT; protein concentration: 1.2-2.0 mg/ml) with 1 μl of reservoir solution consisting of 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 6000, 100 mm Mops, pH 7.0. Crystals (∼600 × 50 × 50 μm) grew within 1 week at 4 °C. For data collection, crystals were frozen in the nitrogen stream after a short soak in 15% ethylene glycol, 30% polyethylene glycol 6000, 100 mm Mops, pH 7.0. X-ray data were collected from a single crystal at 90 K using monochromatic synchrotron radiation (λ = 0.9184 Å) and a MarCCD detector. This work was performed at the Swiss Light Source, Paul Scherrer Institut, Villigen, Switzerland. The crystals belong to space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions of a = 63.65, b = 96.58, and c = 97.55 Å. Data reduction was carried out with the programs DENZO and Scalepack (28Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Due to anisotropic diffraction, the data were cut at 1.65 Å.

Open table in a new tab Structure Solution and Refinement—The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program AMoRe (29Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar) using a (p17/p12)2 polyserine model of caspase-3 (1CP3) as template (30Mittl P.R. Di Marco S. Krebs J.F. Bai X. Karanewsky D.S.

Structure refinement was performed using the program CNS (31Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1, a system for crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). No NCS restraints were used during the refinement of the structure. Electron density was visible for the majority of the amino acids. For dimer A, 8 N-terminal residues of p19 and 6 N-terminal residues of p12 and the C-terminal residue of both chains could not be modeled. For the p19 and p12 subunit of dimer B, 7 and 6 N-terminal residues could not be fitted, respectively. Structure of Caspase-2—During activation, the single-chain procaspase-2 is proteolytically processed to active caspase-2 consisting of one p19 and one p12 subunit, hereafter referred to as a monomer. The structure of caspase-2 comprises two copies of the p19/p12 monomer that contain residues 8/9-168 and 207-304/305, respectively (Fig. 1a). The root mean square deviation of the Cα distance of superimposed monomers, including all 257 Cα atoms is 0.30 Å. Therefore, both monomers can be considered to be identical. The core of the enzyme is formed by a 12-stranded β-sheet, which is surrounded by a total of 14 α-helices. The overall fold of caspase-2 is similar to that of other caspases for which structures have been determined previously (30Mittl P.R. Di Marco S. Krebs J.F. Bai X. Karanewsky D.S. Priestle J.P.

Structure. 1999; 7: 1125-1133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This is illustrated by a superposition of the Cα chains with caspase-3, another representative of the specificity group II caspases, and caspase-9, the closest relative of caspase-2 based on sequence identity (Fig. 1b). Interestingly, caspase-2 shows an extraordinary long structured N terminus of the large p19 subunit. This tail structure contains a short helix and is so far unique to the CARD domain-containing caspases-2 and -1. In caspase-1, a surface disulfide bridge was observed to be stabilizing this extension, but its formation depends on the crystallization conditions. In caspase-2, there are also two cysteine residues at exactly the same position; however, they do not form a disulfide bridge, probably due to the reducing conditions maintained during purification and crystallization. As with other caspases, the dimer is mainly formed by interactions between residues of the central strands of the two p12 subunits (Fig. 1a). The additional interactions found in caspase-9, provided by a 7-residue loop inserted between helices 3 and 3a (36Renatus M. Stennicke H. Scott F. Liddington R. Salvesen G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14250-14255Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), are not present in caspase-2. In this region caspase-2 superimposes well with caspase-3 (Fig. 1b). Aside from the intersubunit disulfide, the absence of this insertion could contribute to the observed difference in dimer formation of caspase-2 compared with caspase-9. The pentapeptidic inhibitor Ac-LDESD-cho is covalently bound to the active site cysteine and all atoms are well-resolved in the electron density (Fig. 1c). Because specificity of caspases is determined predominantly by three specificity loops, which show considerable variation both in length and amino acid composition, it is not surprising that significant structural differences prevail in the vicinity of the active site (Fig. 1b). The Active Site and Inhibitor Binding—Both caspase-2 p19/p12 monomers form an active site to which an inhibitor molecule is bound, this in contrast to its closest relative, caspase-9, which contains only one active site per (p19/p12)2 dimer (36Renatus M. Stennicke H. Scott F. Liddington R. Salvesen G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14250-14255Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The bound Ac-LDESD-cho inhibitor reveals the details of the pentapeptidic substrate recognition site of caspase-2, and its resemblance to the widely used tetrapeptidic Ac-DEVD inhibitor allows a direct comparison with other caspases bound to the latter compound. In the S1 specificity pocket, aspartic acid is absolutely required for catalysis. Accordingly, interactions in S1 are strictly conserved among caspases. The aspartate side chain is buried within the deep positively charged S1 pocket and is stabilized by electrostatic interactions with two arginine residues (Arg179 and Arg341; caspase-1 numbering scheme throughout) and by a hydrogen bond with a conserved glutamine (Gln283; Fig. 2). In addition, most caspase inhibitor complex structures show a hydrogen bond between the P1 backbone carbonyl and the backbone nitrogen of a highly conserved serine, which is replaced in caspase-2 by a glycine (Gly238). Even though aldehyde inhibitors have been described as not exhibiting classic oxyanion hole binding to caspases (30Mittl P.R. Di Marco S. Krebs J.F. Bai X. Karanewsky D.S. Priestle J.P. Tomaselli K.J. Grutter M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6539-6547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), the C-terminal carbonyl group of Ac-LDESD-cho interacts directly with the amide proton of the strictly conserved Gly238 in the oxyanion hole and with the imidazole moiety of the active site histidine (His237). The S2 pocket of the enzyme is not very selective and can accommodate a variety of side chains. Hence, S2 can be considered to be of minor importance for substrate recognition (17Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol.

As seen in other caspases, the glutamate side chain is stabilized by electrostatic interaction with the highly conserved Arg341. Both the P3 backbone nitrogen and the carbonyl oxygen form hydrogen bonds with the respective backbone carbonyl oxygen and nitrogen of the same conserved arginine involved in the surface charge interaction. A charge-charge interaction with a second arginine, Arg177 in caspase-8 (39Blanchard H. Kodandapani L. Mittl P.R. Di Marco S. Krebs J.F. Wu J.C. Tomaselli K.J. Grutter M.G.

https://openalex.org/W2103252821,"B7-H1 is a novel B7 family protein attributed to costimulatory and immune regulatory functions. Here we report that human myoblasts cultured from control subjects and patients with inflammatory myopathies as well as TE671 muscle rhabdomyosarcoma cells express high levels of B7-H1 after stimulation with the inflammatory cytokine IFN-gamma. Coculture experiments of MHC class I/II-positive myoblasts with CD4 and CD8 T cells in the presence of antigen demonstrated the functional consequences of muscle-related B7-H1 expression: production of inflammatory cytokines, IFN-gamma and IL-2, by CD4 as well CD8 T cells was markedly enhanced in the presence of a neutralizing anti-B7-H1 antibody. This observation was paralleled by an augmented expression of the T cell activation markers CD25, ICOS, and CD69, thus showing B7-H1-mediated inhibition of T cell activation. Further, we investigated 23 muscle biopsy specimens from patients with polymyositis (PM), inclusion body myositis (IBM), dermatomyositis (DM), and nonmyopathic controls for B7-H1 expression by immunohistochemistry: B7-H1 was expressed in PM, IBM, and DM specimens but not in noninflammatory and nonmyopathic controls. Staining was predominantly localized to areas of strong inflammation and to muscle cells as well as mononuclear cells. These data highlight the immune regulatory properties of muscle cells and suggest that B7-H1 expression represents an inhibitory mechanism induced upon inflammatory stimuli and aimed at protecting muscle fibers from immune aggression."
https://openalex.org/W2133031337,"Although many different pattern recognition receptors recognizing peptidoglycan and 1,3-β-d-glucan have been identified in vertebrates and insects, the molecular mechanism of these molecules in the pattern recognition and subsequent signaling is largely unknown. To gain insights into the action mechanism of 1,3-β-d-glucan pattern recognition protein in the insect prophenoloxidase (proPO) activation system, we purified a 53-kDa 1,3-β-d-glucan recognition protein (Tm-GRP) to homogeneity from the hemolymph of the mealworm, Tenebrio molitor, by using a 1,3-β-d-glucan affinity column. The purified protein specifically bound to 1,3-β-d-glucan but not to peptidoglycan. Subsequent molecular cloning revealed that Tm-GRP contains a region with close sequence similarity to bacterial glucanases. Strikingly, two catalytically important residues in glucanases are replaced with other nonhomologous amino acids in Tm-GRP. The finding suggests that Tm-GRP has evolved from an ancestral gene of glucanases but retained only the ability to recognize 1,3-β-d-glucan. A Western blot analysis of the protein level of endogenous Tm-GRP showed that the protein was specifically degraded following the activation of proPO with 1,3-β-d-glucan and calcium ion. The degradation was significantly retarded by the addition of serine protease inhibitors but not by cysteine or acidic protease inhibitor. These results suggest that 1,3-β-d-glucan pattern recognition protein is specifically degraded by serine protease(s) during proPO activation, and we propose that this degradation is an important regulatory mechanism of the activation of the proPO system.

These results suggest that 1,3-β-d-glucan pattern recognition protein is specifically degraded by serine protease(s) during proPO activation, and we propose that this degradation is an important regulatory mechanism of the activation of the proPO system. The innate immune system is a host defense mechanism that is evolutionarily conserved from plants to humans (1Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A.

It is activated by a group of germ line-encoded receptors, conceptually termed pattern recognition receptors, that recognize microbial surface determinants that are conserved among microbes but absent in the host, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 1The abbreviations and trivial name used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; proPO, prophenoloxidase; Tm-GRP, T. molitor β-1,3-d-glucan recognition protein; PGN, peptidoglycan; PO, phenoloxidase; PGRP, peptidoglycan recognition proteins; GRP, 1,3-β-d-glucan recognition protein; GNBP, Gram-negative bacteria binding protein; LGBP, LPS -and 1,3-β-d-glucan-binding proteins; ELSG, eluate solution from 1,3-β-d-glucan-immobilized column; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; p-APMSF, p-amidinophenyl methane sulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; Boc, butoxycarbonyl; Suc, succinyl; MCA, 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide; E-64, l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane.1The abbreviations and trivial name used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; proPO, prophenoloxidase; Tm-GRP, T. molitor β-1,3-d-glucan recognition protein; PGN, peptidoglycan; PO, phenoloxidase; PGRP, peptidoglycan recognition proteins; GRP, 1,3-β-d-glucan recognition protein; GNBP, Gram-negative bacteria binding protein; LGBP, LPS -and 1,3-β-d-glucan-binding proteins; ELSG, eluate solution from 1,3-β-d-glucan-immobilized column; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; p-APMSF, p-amidinophenyl methane sulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; Boc, butoxycarbonyl; Suc, succinyl; MCA, 4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide; E-64, l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane. peptidoglycan (PGN), 1,3-β-d-glucan, and mannan (referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns). Upon recognition, these receptors activate distinct signaling cascades that regulate specific gene expression programs aimed at the aggressors. Recently, our knowledge of innate immunity in mammalian and insects has increased dramatically (1Hoffmann J.A. Kafatos F.C. Janeway C.A. Ezekowitz R.A.

The recruitment of similar receptors and pathways in both insects and mammals in the fight against infection suggests that they have developed similar mechanisms and molecular pathways to recognize and eliminate invaders (1Hoffmann J.A.

Science. 2002; 296: 298-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar). The activation of the prophenoloxidase (proPO) cascade is a major innate immune reaction in invertebrates triggered by elicitors derived from microbial cell walls such as LPS, PGN, and glucan (7Söderhäll K.

The proPO activation pathway, like the vertebrate complement system, is a proteolytic cascade containing several serine proteases and their inhibitors and terminates with the zymogen, proPO. Microbial carbohydrates such as LPS, PGN, or 1,3-d-β-glucan will first react with pattern recognition proteins, which then will induce activation of several serine proteases within the proPO system (7Söderhäll K.

It is known that one of the serine proteases in the cascade, which is named proPO-activating enzyme or factor, will cleave proPO to generate the active enzyme, phenoloxidase (PO) (13Lee S.Y. Cho M.Y.

Determining the molecular mechanism by which pattern recognition molecules differentiate non-self from self and transduce signals that stimulate defense responses is a key for understanding the ways in which innate immune systems are regulated.

We were able to reconstitute in vitro the downstream components of the proPO cascade using biochemically purified compounds from the large insect, Holotrichia diomphalia larvae (18Kim M.S. Baek M.J. Lee M.H. Park J.W. Lee S.Y. Söderhäll K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39999-40004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although we have determined that the downstream part of proPO system is regulated by two easter-type serine proteases and a masquerade-type serine protease homologue and involves two-step limited proteolysis for showing PO activity (18Kim M.S. Baek M.J. Lee M.H. Park J.W. Lee S.Y. Söderhäll K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39999-40004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the upstream part of the proPO cascade is still poorly understood. Also, it remains to be elucidated how the connection between the upstream and downstream part of the proPO cascade is organized and activated. A hypothesis is that the pattern recognition molecules, such as PGRPs, GRPs, GNBPs, and LGBPs, will make a complex with the proPO-activating enzyme(s) and microbial cell wall components, and then activated proPO-activating enzyme(s) will convert proPO to active PO by a limited proteolysis. We have undertaken a task to purify 1,3-β-d-glucan-binding protein to understand the upstream part of the proPO cascade in the larvae of mealworm, Tenebrio molitor. Here we present the isolation, molecular cloning, and biological functions of a new 1,3-β-d-glucan pattern recognition protein. Animals—T. molitor larvae (mealworm) were maintained on a laboratory bench in terraria containing wheat bran. Vegetables were placed on top of the bran to provide water. Hemolymph and hemocytes were collected as previously described (19Lee K.Y Zhang R. Kim M.S. Park J.W. Park H.Y. Kawabata S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4375-4383Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, to harvest the hemolymph, larvae were injected with 50 μl of a modified anti-coagulation buffer (30 mm trisodium citrate, 26 mm citric acid, 20 mm EDTA, and 15 mm sodium chloride, pH 5.5, buffer A) using a 25-gauge needle. The tail of each larva was cut off using a fine pair of scissors, and the extruding hemolymph was placed in a test tube on ice. The collected crude hemolymph was centrifuged at 203,000 × g for 4 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was then stored at -80 °C until use. Assay of PO Activity—An assay of PO was carried out according to our previously published method (18Kim M.S. Baek M.J. Lee M.H. Park J.W. Lee S.Y. Söderhäll K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39999-40004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, to measure PO activity, 30 μl of crude hemolymph (150 μg of proteins) or fractionated solution from column chromatography was preincubated in 85 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 μg of 1,3-β-d-glucan for 10 min at 30 °C, and then 400 μl of substrate solution (1 mm 4-methylcatechol, 2 mm 4-hydroxyproline ethylester in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm CaCl2) was added to the reaction mixture. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the increase in absorbance at 520 nm was measured using a Shimadzu spectrophotometer. One unit of PO activity was defined as the amount of enzyme causing an increase in absorbance of 0.1 at 520 nm per 10-min incubation (A 520/10 min). To examine the effects of the eluate solution from the 1,3-β-d-glucan affinity column (referred to as ELSG) on PO activity, 1,3-β-d-glucan-binding protein-excluded hemolymph was obtained by passing Tenebrio hemolymph through the 1,3-β-d-glucan-immobilized column. The bound proteins on the 1,3-β-d-glucan column were eluted with buffer A containing 8 m urea, and then urea was immediately excluded by repeated ultrafiltrations (YM10 membrane; Amicon) with buffer A. To reconstitute the 1,3-β-d-glucan-dependent PO activity, the urea-excluded eluate solution and 1,3-β-d-glucan-binding protein-depleted hemolymph was incubated in the presence of 1,3-β-d-glucan and Ca2+, and then PO activity was examined. To check the effects of the purified T. molitor 1,3-β-d-glucan-binding Protein (Tm-GRP) on the Tenebrio proPO system, the purified native Tm-GRP (0.5 μg) was incubated with crude hemolymph (250 μg) containing the proPO system and the ELSG or pass-through solution (250 μg) of the 1,3-β-d-glucan affinity column at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of Ca2+ and 1,3-β-d-glucan as described above. Preparation of 1,3-β-d-Glucan Affinity Column by Using AF-Amino Toyopearl 650 M Resin—A 1,3-β-d-glucan affinity column was prepared as previously described (41Takaki Y. Seki N. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Muta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14281-14287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 ml of insoluble 1,3-β-d-glucan (curdlan; Wako) stock solution (500 mg of curdlan was dissolved in 15 ml of 1 n NaOH solution) was added to 20 ml of 0. 2 m K2HPO4, and pH was adjusted to 8.4 with 6 m HCl. 2.5 g of suction-dried AF-Amino Toyopearl 650 M was suspended in the soluble curdlan solution prepared with 10 n NaOH. After the addition of 1 g of NaCNBH3, the suspension was incubated at 60 °C overnight. The gel was then acetylated to block remaining free amino groups by incubating with 8 ml of 0.2 m sodium acetate and 4 ml of acetic anhydride on ice for 30 min followed by the addition of an additional 4 ml of acetic anhydride and then incubation for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, the resin was washed with 150 ml of 0.1 m NaOH, 150 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and finally with a sufficient amount of distilled water. As a control, the resin was treated with the same procedure described above but without curdlan. The coupled 1,3-β-d-glucans to resins were quantified by the sulfuric acid-phenol method (42Rao P. Pattabiraman T.N. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 181: 18-22Crossref Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The resins that bound more than 3 μg of glucose/mg of resin were used for purification of Tenebrio 1,3-β-d-glucan-binding protein. Purification of the Denatured Tenebrio Tm-GBP—To purify hemolymph proteins that can recognize 1,3-β-d-glucan from the hemolymph of T. molitor larvae, 50 ml of hemolymph solution (300 mg of proteins) was collected after ultracentrifugation at 203,000 × g for 4h at 4 °C and then filtered with 0.45-μm Gelman polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The obtained supernatant solution was applied to a 1,3-β-d-glucan-immobilized Toyopearl 650 M column (2.5 × 5 cm) equilibrated with buffer A at 0.6 ml/min. After washing the column with buffer A until no absorbance at 280 nm, bound proteins were eluted at a rate of 0.5 ml/min with buffer A containing 8 m urea and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions. The major 53-kDa band was cut out from the gel and was then extracted by electroelution with 250 mA for 3 h at 4 °C according to the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, the purity of the 53-kDa was checked by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. On the control column (2.5 × 5 cm), 20 ml of hemolymph was loaded to the column, which had been preequilibrated with buffer A at 0.6 ml/min, and bound proteins were eluted with the same method as described above. To determine the partial amino acid sequences of the purified 53-kDa protein, the purified protein (25 μg) was reduced, alkylated, and digested with 2 μg of lysylendopeptidase at 37 °C for 13 h. The digested peptides were separated by HPLC on a C18 reverse phase column (Gilson) with a linear gradient between 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water and 0.052% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile (18Kim M.S. Baek M.J. Lee M.H. Park J.W. Lee S.Y. Söderhäll K. Lee B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39999-40004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified 53-kDa protein and the amino acid sequences of internal peptides from HPLC were determined on an Applied Biosystem Procise automated gas phase sequencer (43LeGendre N. Matsudaira P. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 154-159PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of the Native Tm-GRP—After ultracentrifugation of 100 ml of crude hemolymph, the resulting supernatant was loaded to a control Toyopearl 650 M column (2.5 × 5 cm), which had been preequilibrated with buffer A at a rate of 0.6 ml/min. The flow-through solution from the control column was loaded again to a 1,3-β-d-glucan-coupled Toyopearl 650 M column, which also pre-equilibrated with buffer A at the same flow rate as the control Toyopearl column. After washing the column with buffer A until absorbance at 280 nm was zero, bound proteins were eluted with 50 ml of buffer A containing 8 m urea at 0.5 ml/min, and eluted proteins were analyzed on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. The 53-kDa Tm-GRP was cut out from the gels. After transferring the gel slices to a new Eppendorf tube, the proteins on crushed gels were carefully extracted with 200 μl of buffer A containing 8 m urea at 40 °C for 30 min. After loading the extraction solution to plasmid extraction microspin column (Qiagen), the column was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to separate gel slices and the extracted solution. Finally, the extraction solution was loaded to a Superdex 200 FPLC column for the exclusion of urea, pre-equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl (pH 6.8, buffer B), and then eluted with buffer B at 0.2 ml/min. The purity of the purified native Tm-GRP was confirmed by SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions. cDNA Cloning and Nucleotide Sequencing of 53-kDa Tm-GRP—A cDNA library from T. molitor larvae was constructed with a previously described method (13Lee S.Y. Cho M.Y. Hyun J.H. Lee K.M. Homma K.-I. Natori S. Kawabata S.-I. Iwanaga S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) using a ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene). Seven partial amino acid sequences of the purified 53-kDa protein were determined. Among them, a DNA oligonucleotide corresponding to PDQIPMM (5′-CCIGA(C/T)CA(A/G)AT(A/T/C)ACIATGATGGT-3′) was synthesized, and it was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by a previously described method (44Sgaramella V.

The membranes were prehybridized at 65 °C for 1 h in 5× SSC (750 mm NaCl, 75 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 5× Denhardt's solution (100× Denhardt's solution: 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 2% (w/v) Ficoll, and 2% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone), 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 0.5% SDS. The membranes were then hybridized at 65 °C for 12 h in the same solution as during prehybridization. Five hybridization-positive clones were obtained, and two of them were found to contain an 882-base pair fragment of Tm-GRP cDNA. To obtain the full cDNA of Tm-GRP, the cDNA library from T. molitor larvae was screened once again with a 770-base pair fragment prepared by the random primer method and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. Plaques that hybridized to the probe were purified to homogeneity and subcloned by in vivo excision of pBluescript plasmids. The positive clone with the longest cDNA insertion was sequenced using vector primers with an Applied Biosystems PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The amino acid sequence of the 53-kDa Tm-GRP was compared with the protein sequence data base of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the Genetyx system (Software Development Co., Ltd., Tokyo). Antibody and Immunoblotting—An antibody against purified Tm-GRP was raised by injecting 10 μg of the purified protein into a male albino rabbit with complete Freund's adjuvant and giving two booster injections with the same amount of protein 7 and 14 days later (45McCauley R. Racker E. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1973; 1: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The resulting antibody was affinity-purified as previously described (46Cho M.Y. Lee H.S. Lee K.M. Homma K. Natori S. Lee B.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, the proteins separated on SDS-PAGE were transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the membrane was blocked by immersion in 5% skimmed milk solution containing 1% horse serum for 12 h. The membrane was then transferred to rinse solution I (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 2.5% skimmed milk) containing the affinity-purified antibody against Tm-GRP (50 ng/ml) and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The bound antibody was identified using the ECL Western blotting reagent kit (Amersham Biosciences). Determination of Tm-GRP Localization—Hemolymph was obtained from 150 larvae and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was used as a plasma solution. The precipitated hemocytes were washed with 500 μl of buffer A and suspended again with 500 μl of buffer A, sonicated for 15 s at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm (22,000 × g) at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was used as a source of hemocyte lysate. The soluble proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and subjected to SDS-PAGE and then immunoblotting with the affinity-purified antibody raised against the purified 53-kDa Tm-GRP. Western Blot Analysis of 53-kDa Tm-GRP during proPO Activation—To follow the change of the amount of endogenous Tm-GRP during proPO activation, we first measured β-1,3-glucan-dependent PO activity by incubating the pass-through solution from the glucan column with the ELGS or incubating the purified 53-kDa Tm-GRP with the crude hemolymph both in the presence of 1,3-β-d-glucan and Ca2+. The reaction mixtures were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid at various time intervals. After performing SDS-PAGE, the amount of 53-kDa Tm-GRP was examined by Western blot analysis using the purified Tm-GRP antibody. Effects of Protease Inhibitors on Degradation of Tm-GRP and Tenebrio proPO System—Four kinds of protease inhibitors (p-nitroguanidino benzoate, p-amidinophenyl methane sulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (p-APMSF), l-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E-64), and pepstatin A) were used to reveal whether these inhibitors might have an effect on the amount of Tm-GRP during proPO system activation.

Here we show that most members of the collagen superfamily contain short, repeating heptad sequences typical of coiled coils. Such sequences are found at the N-terminal ends of the C-propeptide domains in all fibrillar procollagens. When fused C-terminal to a reporter molecule containing a collagen-like sequence that does not spontaneously trimerize, the C-propeptide heptad repeats induced trimerization. C-terminal heptad repeats were also found in the oligomerization domains of the multiplexins (collagens XV and XVIII). N-terminal heptad repeats are known to drive trimerization in transmembrane collagens, whereas fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices, as well as collagens VII, XIII, XXIII, and XXV, were found to contain heptad repeats between collagen domains. Finally, heptad repeats were found in the von Willebrand factor A domains known to be involved in trimerization of collagen VI, as well as in collagen VII.

Unconventional Collagens.

Early studies on the procollagen precursors of the fibrillar collagens (types I–III, V, and XI) (6Mclaughlin S.H. Bulleid N.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) showed that the C-propeptide regions are necessary to direct correct chain association, which is followed by zipper-like folding of the triple helix in the C- to N-terminal direction (7Engel J.

The paradigm here is the collectin family (22Hakansson K. Reid K.B. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1607-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which includes the lung surfactant proteins (SP-A and SP-D), mannan-binding proteins (MBP-A and MBP-C), conglutinin, and collectin-43. Collectins are trimeric molecules in which each chain contains a collagen-like domain followed by an α-helical coiled-coil region and then a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). The amino acid sequence of the coiled-coil domain is characterized by up to four heptad repeats (a-b-c-d-e-f-g) in which hydrophobic amino acid residues occur at positions a and d (23Kammerer R.A. Matrix Biol. 1997; 15: 555-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures of the coiled-coil and CRD regions in MBP and SP-D show that chains within the trimer are associated via a three-stranded coiled coil, with the three CRDs arranged as distinct lobes (24Sheriff S.

Several studies have shown that the coiled-coil region is both necessary and sufficient for trimerization of SP-D (27Hoppe H.J. Barlow P.N. Reid K.B.M.

Coiled-coil oligomerization domains have also been shown to be essential for trimerization and folding of the membrane-associated collagens XIII (30Snellman A. Tu H.M. Visnen T. Kvist A.P. Huhtala P.

In all of these proteins, the transmembrane domain is found close to the N terminus and is followed immediately by a heptad repeat region at the beginning of the large ectodomain. Once trimerized via the coiled-coil domains, folding of the C-terminal collagen helix then proceeds in the N- to C-terminal direction. N-terminal coiled-coil oligomerization domains are thought to play similar roles in the assembly of macrophage scavenger receptor proteins (35Frank S. Lustig A. Schulthess T. Engel J. Kammerer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11672-11677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which also contain collagen-like regions. Several coiled-coil domains, as well as collagen-like regions, are also present in the emilins (36Colombatti A. Doliana E. Bot S. Canton A. Mongiat M. Mungiguerra G. Paron-Cilli S. Spessotto P. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Here we show that putative α-helical coiled-coil oligomerization domains are present in most members of the collagen superfamily, located either before, after, or between collagen-like regions, suggesting a general role in triple-helical assembly. Sequence Analysis—All sequences were obtained from Swiss-Prot, SPTREMBL, or REMTREMBL data bases. Potential coiled-coil sequences in all polypeptide chains of the collagen superfamily were searched initially using the program COILS2 (37Lupas A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 513-525Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the reliability of this computational approach is very limited, particularly for short (14-residue) sequences, all “hits” (regardless of score) were also examined by informed eye in order to assess the likelihood of coiled-coil formation. Experience has shown that this approach can more easily recognize heptad discontinuities and individual or small groups of residues that are generally disruptive to coiled-coil formation, hence allowing elimination of some regions from further consideration. Although sequences were analyzed for their potential to form either two- or three-stranded helices using SCORER (38Woolfson D.N. Alber T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1596-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), their very short lengths (2–3 heptads in general) rendered the results statistically uncertain. The presence of three-chain structures in the proteins reported here would nonetheless strongly favor the formation of three-stranded rather two-stranded coiled coils. To test the plausibility of a three-stranded coiled-coil geometry for the heptad containing region of type I procollagen C-propeptides, a model three-stranded coiled coil was built based on the homotrimeric GCN4-pII leucine zipper structure (Protein Data Bank code 1gcm). Appropriate residue replacements were made, placing the pro-α1 chains onto chains A and B and the pro-α2 chain onto chain C of GCN4-pII, in such a way as to ensure the heptad repeat patterns were in phase. The packing of the core residues was then checked manually using Turbo-Frodo 5.5 (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/TURBO_FRODO), noting particularly the positions of the a and d residues relative to those in the GCN4-pII structure. Automated energy minimization was done in a multistep process using conjugate gradients followed by simulated annealing with CNSsolve 0.5 (39Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16919) Google Scholar). In the conjugate gradient minimization, the main chain atoms were first held fixed followed by harmonically restraining them to their initial positions with an energy constant of 10 kcal/mol·A2. Annealing using torsion dynamics was employed with the main chain atoms again harmonically restrained. Synthesis of Chimeric IIA N-pro/CPII cDNA Fusion Constructs— cDNA fusion constructs encoding the full-length human type IIA procollagen N-propeptide linked to 18, 25, or 31 amino acids of the coiled-coil domain present at the beginning of the type II procollagen C-propeptide (IIA N-pro/CPII; Fig. 3) were synthesized by overlap extension PCR. Oligonucleotide primers used for PCR and overlap extension PCR procedures were from Invitrogen. One PCR was carried out to amplify type IIA N-propeptide cDNA using primers 1 and 2 (Table I) for 30 cycles (95 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 50 s). Here IIA N-pro/SP-D cDNA in pGEM3Z was used as a substrate (28Zhang P. McAlinden A. Li S. Schumacher T. Wang H. Hu S. Sandell L. Crouch E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19862-19870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Another set of PCRs was done to amplify cDNA encoding the 18-, 25-, or 31-amino acid sequence of the C-propeptide (plus the terminal alanine residue of the telopeptide at the procollagen C-proteinase cleavage site) corresponding to amino acid numbers 1172–1189, 1172–1196, or 1172–1202, respectively (GenBank™ accession number X16468). Table I shows the sequence of the PCR primer pairs used to amplify the cDNA fragments encoding each of the three C-propeptide regions. Each of these PCRs was carried out for 30 cycles (95 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 25 s), and oligonucleotides encoding amino acid residues 1172–1189, 1172–1196, or 1172–1202 of the C-propeptide were used as substrates. Overlap extension PCRs were then prepared by mixing cDNA encoding the IIA N-propeptide with cDNA encoding one of the three C-propeptide cDNA fragments. To promote overlap extension, a preliminary PCR was carried out for 5 cycles in the absence of primers (95 °C, 30 s; 52 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 45 s). Primer pairs were then added to each PCR (Table I), and IIA N-pro/CPII cDNA fusion constructs were amplified for 30 cycles (95 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 55 s). cDNA fusion constructs were purified from 1% agarose gels, digested with EcoRI, and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). DNA sequencing using the T7 and Sp-6 promoter primers confirmed correct orientation of the inserted cDNA fragments.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for amplification of cDNA encoding the type IIA N-propeptide (IIA N-pro) or three regions of the type II procollagen C-propeptide domain (CPII)cDNAPrimer pairs for PCR (5′-3′)IIA N-propeptideF 1, ggtacgaattcatgattcgcctcgggR 2, tgcctggtcggccattggtccttgcatCPII (aa 1172-1189)F 3, aggaccaatggccgaccaggcagcagccR 4, catgggaattctcatcatgtggcatccacctcCPII (aa 1172-1196)F 3, aggaccaatggccgaccaggcagcagccR 5, catgggaattctcatcactggttgttgagggaCPII (aa 1172-1202)F 3, aggaccaatggccgaccaggcagcagccR 6, catgggaattctcatcagctgcggatgctctcFusion cDNA constructPrimer pairs for overlap extension PCRIIA N-pro/CPII (aa 1172-1189)1 + 4IIA N-pro/CPII (aa 1172-1196)1 + 5IIA N-pro/CPII (aa 1172-1202)1 + 6 Open table in a new tab Transient Transfections—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were plated overnight in 6-well tissue culture dishes at a density of 3 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 alone or pcDNA3 containing each of the three cDNA fusion constructs (IIA N-pro/CPII amino acids 1172–1189/1196/1202) using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science), in the presence of 50 μg/ml ascorbate. Cells transfected to synthesize full-length IIA N-pro/SP-D fusion protein (28Zhang P. McAlinden A. Li S. Schumacher T. Wang H. Hu S. Sandell L. Crouch E. J. Biol.

Conditioned medium (12–36 ml per fusion construct) was harvested after 2 days in culture and clarified by centrifugation. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm) was added to the medium, and proteins were precipitated overnight at 4 °C with 33% ammonium sulfate. Precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation and washed three times in saturated ammonium sulfate. Protein pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (1–3 ml) and dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C. Chemical Cross-linking and Detection of Chimeric Fusion Proteins— Covalent cross-linking of fusion proteins was done using bis-(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3; Pierce). Increasing amounts of BS3 (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, or 2 mm final concentration) prepared in 5 mm sodium citrate, pH 5, were added to dialyzed conditioned medium for 1 h at room temperature. Addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer containing Tris-HCl (0.5 m) inhibited the reaction. Samples were boiled for 5 min prior to SDS-PAGE, which was carried out without sulfhydryl reduction. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by Western blotting, and the presence of cross-linked dimers or trimers was identified by immunolocalization using anti-IIA polyclonal antisera (40Oganesian A. Zhu Y. Sandell L.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1469-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Peptide Analysis—Peptides corresponding to GCN4-pII (RMKQIEDKIEEILSKIYHIENEIARIKKLIGER-NH2) and residues 1172–1189 (ADQAAGGLRQHDAEVDAT-NH2), 1172–1196 (ADQAAGGLRQHDAEVDATLKSLNNQ-NH2), and 1172–1202 (ADQAAGGLRQHDAEVDATLKSLNNQIESIRS-NH2) from human procollagen II were synthesized on a Milligan 9050 instrument with Fmoc/DIC/HOBt chemistry. They were then cleaved using trifluoroacetic acid with classical scavengers and precipitated in diethyl ether, followed by centrifugation. Pellets were then dissolved in water and lyophilized. The crude peptides were then re-dissolved in water and purified on a Vydac column (C18, 5 μm, 25 × 1 cm) with an appropriate gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. They were then characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry (SCIEX API 165) and by high pressure liquid chromatography (HP1100) using an analytical Vydac C18 column with a 30-min gradient from 7 to 63% acetonitrile. Far-UV (180–260 nm) circular dichroism measurements were carried out using thermostated 0.2-mm path length quartz cells in a Jobin-Yvon CD6 instrument, calibrated with aqueous d 10-camphorsulfonic acid. Peptides (200-400 μm) were analyzed at 25 °C in 20 mm KH2PO4/NaOH, 150 mm NaF, pH 7.2, in the presence or absence of 50% TFE (41Pan O.H. Beck K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14205-14209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Spectra were measured with wavelength increment 0.2 nm, integration time 1 s, and bandpass 2 nm. For cross-linking analysis with BS3, conditions were the same as those used for the fusion proteins (see above), except that peptide concentrations were as for the circular dichroism. Coiled Coils in Fibrillar Procollagen C-propeptides— Fig. 1A shows an amino acid sequence alignment of the C-propeptide domains of the human fibrillar procollagens. From the pattern of repeating hydrophobic residues at positions a and d, and the frequent occurrence of charged residues at positions e and g, it can be seen that there are up to four heptad repeats, indicative of coiled coils, beginning soon after the procollagen C-proteinase cleavage site. In all chains, the g position at the end of the fourth heptad repeat is a proline which therefore defines the end of the α-helical region. The extent of the heptad repeat pattern is similar to that found in the collectins (Fig. 1B), again C-terminal to the collagenous region. This suggests the existence of a coiled-coil structure near the N terminus of all fibrillar C-propeptide trimers. Putative coiled-coil regions were also found C-terminal to the triple helix in the fibrillar procollagens XXIV (42Gordon M.K. Hahn R.A. Zhou P. Bhatt P. Song R. Kistler A. Gerecke D.R. Koch M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 359Google Scholar) and XXVII (43Pace J.M. Corrado M. Missero C. Byers P.H. Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 44Boot-Handford R.P.

When the C-propeptide heptad repeats were further analyzed using SCORER (38Woolfson D.N. Alber T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1596-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), a preference for three-stranded, as opposed to two-stranded, coiled coils was evident (data not shown). Modeling of the three-dimensional structure of the type I procollagen C-propeptide di-heptad sequence spanning the d positions of heptads two and four (Fig. 1A), based on that adopted by the mutated form of the GCN4 leucine zipper (GCN4-pII, in which residues at the a and d positions are isoleucines) (45Harbury P.B. Kim P.S. Alber T. Nature. 1994; 371: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) was consistent with a three-stranded coiled-coil conformation free of steric clashes (Fig. 2). Possible ionic interactions stabilizing the structure are listed in Table II. Based on this analysis, and in view of the recent observation that a di-heptad repeat in SP-D is sufficient for trimerization (29McAlinden A. Crouch E. Bann J.G. Zhang P. Sandell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41274-41281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), this suggests that the heptad repeats in the fibrillar procollagen C-propeptides could also act as oligomerization domains.Table IIPossible interactions between charged amino acid residues in the putative coiled regions of the human fibrillar procollagen C-propeptidesi → i + 3i → i + 4g → ePro-α1(I)Glu15-Arg18Asp4-Lys8Pro-α2(I)Asp4-Lys8Pro-α1(II)Glu15-Arg18Asp4-Lys8Pro-α1(III)Pro-α1(V)Glu15-Lys18Lys11-Glu15Glu13-Lys18E15-Arg19Pro-α2(V)Glu15-Arg18Pro-α1(XI)Glu15-Lys18Lys11-Glu15Asp13-Lys18Pro-α2(XI)Asp8-Arg11Arg12-Glu16Glu13-Arg18Glu15-Arg18Glu15-Arg19 Open table in a new tab Coiled Coils in Procollagens as Oligomerization Domains—In order to test whether the heptad repeats in the procollagen C-propeptides can act as oligomerization domains, we adopted the approach described by McAlinden et al. (29McAlinden A. Crouch E. Bann J.G. Zhang P. Sandell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41274-41281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in which putative trimerization domains were fused C-terminal to the type IIA procollagen N-propeptide and expressed in CHO cells. The IIA N-propeptide contains a short, interrupted (GXY)n region (25 triplets), which alone does not spontaneously trimerize. When fused to at least the first two heptad repeats of the neck region of SP-D, however, trimerization ensues, as revealed by electrophoretic analysis after stabilization of trimers by cross-linking. By using the same IIA N-propeptide as a trimerization reporter molecule, we made fusion constructs using sequences from the C-propeptide of human type II procollagen, beginning at the alanine residue in the procollagen C-proteinase cleavage site, up to the end of the second, third, or fourth heptad repeats (Fig. 3). As shown in Fig. 4A, positive controls with the IIA N-propeptide fused to the entire C-terminal region of SP-D (beginning at the first heptad repeat) readily formed dimers and trimers, as expected (29McAlinden A. Crouch E. Bann J.G. Zhang P. Sandell L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41274-41281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), whereas in the absence of an oligomerization domain only monomers were observed (Fig. 4B). In contrast, when the IIA N-propeptide was fused to the N-terminal sequence of the type II procollagen C-propeptide, up to position f in the fourth heptad repeat, cross-linkable dimers and trimers were again observed (Fig. 4C). Similar results were obtained with fusion constructs containing only the first three (Fig. 4D) or two (Fig. 4E) heptad repeats. The data obtained with the fusion constructs show that sequences from the N-terminal region of the procollagen II C-propeptide can trimerize when linked to the IIA N-propeptide. To determine whether these sequences are capable of trimerizing independently, the corresponding peptides were synthesized along with GCN4-pII as a positive control. When analyzed by circular dichroism (Fig. 5A), GCN4-pII gave a spectrum characteristic of an almost fully α-helical coiled coil, as shown by the positions and heights of the peaks at 192, 208, and 222 nm, with a ratio of mean residue ellipticities θ220/θ208 of 1.039. In the presence of 50% TFE (Fig. 5B), which disrupts coiled coils and stabilizes α-helices (46Litowski J.R. Hodges R.S. J. Pept. Res. 2001; 58: 477-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), this ratio decreased to 0.84, due mainly to changes in the peak at 208 nm, as expected. In contrast, all three peptides from the N-terminal region of the procollagen II C-propeptide yielded spectra characteristic of random coils, in the absence of TFE. Therefore these peptides do not form stable coiled coils independently. In the presence of 50% TFE, spectra clearly characteristic of α-helices were obtained with the two longer peptides (residues 1172–1196 and 1172–1202), whereas the shorter peptide (residues 1172–1189) showed some signs of α-helical structure. Therefore, all three peptides are capable of adopting an α-helical fold. The results obtained by circular dichroism were confirmed by cross-linking analysis using BS3, followed by SDS-PAGE, which showed trimerization of GCN4-pII but not of a similar length peptide (residues 1172–1202) from the human procollagen II C-propeptide (data not shown). C-terminal Coiled Coils in Other Members of the Collagen Superfamily—α-Helical coiled-coil heptad repeats were also found in the C-propeptides of known invertebrate fibrillar procollagens, including the sponge Ephydatia muelleri, hydra, annelids (alvinella, arenicola, and riftia), mollusc (abalone), and sea urchin (Fig. 1C) (47Exposito J.Y. Cluzel C. Garrone R. Lethias C. Anat. Rec. 2002; 268: 302-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 48Boot-Handford R.P. Tuckwell D.S. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Both the length and distance of the heptad repeats from the end of the collagen triple-helical region were similar to those in the vertebrate fibrillar collagens (Fig. 1A), although in hydra and annelid fibrillar procollagens the intervening sequence was relatively long (Fig. 1C). Similar C-terminally located heptad sequences were also found in some bacteriophage tail fiber collagen-like proteins (data not shown). As pointed out by Beck and Brodsky (49Beck K. Brodsky B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), a possible coiled-coil oligomerization domain C-terminal to the triple helix is also found in the collagen-like tail subunit of acetylcholinesterase (ColQ) (50Ohno K. Brengman J. Tsujino A. Engel A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9654-9659Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The sequence (Fig. 1D) consists of 2.5 heptad repeats and is found about 30 residues C-terminal to the last GPP triplet, similar to that in the procollagen C-propeptides. Probable trimerization domains have also been identified in the multiplexins (collagens XV and XVIII) (51Sasaki T. Fukai N. Mann K. Gohring W. Olsen B.R. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4249-4256Crossref"
https://openalex.org/W2015686095,"Using fura-2 and the manganese quenching technique, we show here that sarcolemmal permeability to cations (SP-Ca) of slow-twitch muscles is greater than that of fast-twitch ones. This appears to be related to a higher expression and/or activity of stretch-activated channels, whereas leak channel activities are similar. During hindlimb suspension (HU), we found highly correlated decreases in SPCa and resting calcium of soleus muscle toward values of extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle. This was significant as soon as 3 days of suspension, contrary to soleus muscle caffeine sensitivity and responsiveness that were not modified after this HU period. After 14 days of HU, SP-Ca, resting calcium, and caffeine response of soleus muscle became similar to that normally observed in EDL muscle. These results demonstrate that the correlated decreases in SP-Ca and resting calcium precede most functional changes due to HU. Given the known shortening of HU soleus muscle, we proposed that this could induce a decrease of SP-Ca and a consequent reduction of resting calcium. According to the crucial role of resting cytosolic free calcium in the maintenance and the adaptation of muscle phenotype, our results suggest that slow-to-fast transition of HU soleus muscle is calcium dependent."

In this study, we have employed Ca2+ imaging and the single-electrode voltage-clamp technique to investigate whether the NAADP-mediated Ca2+ entry discovered in our laboratory in starfish oocytes was underlain by a membrane current and whether the response to NAADP required an intact cytoskeleton. Uncaging of preinjected NAADP evoked a cortical Ca2+ flash that was followed by the spreading of the wave to the remainder of the cell. No Ca2+ increase was detected in Ca2+-free sea water. Under voltage-clamp conditions, the photoliberation of NAADP activated an inward rectifying membrane current, which reversed at potentials more positive than +50 mV and was abolished by removal of Ca2+ but not of Na+. The current was affected by preincubation with verapamil, SKF 96356, and thapsigargin but not by preinjection of heparin, 8-NH2- cyclic ADP-ribose, or both antagonists. The membrane current and the Ca2+ wave were inhibited by latrunculin-A and jasplakinolide, which depolymerize and stabilize actin cytoskeleton, respectively. These data offer the first demonstration that NAADP initiates a Ca2+ sweep by activating a Ca2+-permeable membrane current that requires an intact F-actin cytoskeleton as other Ca2+-permeable currents, such as ICRAC and IARC."

The formation of active ARF6GTP is stimulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as cytohesins, which translocate to the plasma membrane in agonist-stimulated cells by binding the lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate through the pleckstrin homology domain with subsequent ARF6 activation.

Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that IPCEF1 co-localizes with cytohesin 2 to the cytosol in unstimulated cells and translocates to the plasma membrane via binding to cytohesin 2 in epidermal growth factor-stimulated cells. However, a deletion mutant of IPCEF1 that lacks the cytohesin 2 binding site failed to co-migrate with cytohesin 2 to the membrane in stimulated cells.

(2000) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2000/59/re1.Google Scholar). Like other small GTPases, ARFs also function as molecular on/off switches by shuttling between an inactive GDP- and an active GTP-bound form. In mammalian cells, the ARF family consists of six ARF isoforms (ARF1–6). ARF1 and ARF6 are the best characterized and the most distantly related members of the ARF family. ARF1 localizes to the cytosol in the GDP-bound form and attaches in the GTP-bound form to the Golgi complex where it regulates vesicle formation by recruiting cytosolic coat proteins (COPI and AP1) onto the Golgi membranes (3Lippincott-Schwartz J. Cole N.B. Donaldson J. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 109: 449-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). ARF1 has been implicated in cellular events such as protein secretion (2Randazzo, P. A., Nie, Z., Miura, K., and Hsu, V. W. (2000) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2000/59/re1.Google Scholar). ARF6, by contrast, associates with a tubular endosomal compartment in its inactive GDP-bound state and localizes to the plasma membrane in its active GTP-bound state. It primarily regulates vesicle trafficking between these two compartments by acting as a GDP/GTP-regulated switch (4Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). ARF6 plays an important role in cellular events such as receptor-mediated endocytosis, regulated exocytosis, and cell spreading by regulating cortical actin rearrangement beneath the plasma membrane and membrane ruffling (2Randazzo, P. A., Nie, Z., Miura, K., and Hsu, V. W. (2000) Science's STKE http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/OC_sigtrans;2000/59/re1.Google Scholar, 4Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). ARFs are regulated by two kinds of proteins: ARF guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which promote exchange of bound GDP with GTP, and ARF GTPase-activating proteins, which activate the hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP (5Jackson T.R. Kearns B.G. Theibert A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 489-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6Donaldson J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3792-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).ARF GEFs are divided into two major groups, high molecular weight and low molecular weight, on the basis of sequence similarity, functional differences, and sensitivity to brefeldin A, a fungal metabolite that inhibits activation of ARF1 but not ARF6 (7Klausner R.D. Jonaldson J.G. Lippincott S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). The high molecular weight mammalian ARF GEFs (>100 kDa in size) consist of BIG1, BIG2, and GBF1 (Golgi-specific brefeldin A resistance factor 1). They localize to and regulate membrane trafficking in the Golgi region (4Donaldson J.G. Jackson C.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 8Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). BIG1 and BIG2 have been reported to be sensitive to brefeldin A. The low molecular weight mammalian ARF GEFs include the cytohesin family, the EFA6 (exchange factor for ARF6) family, and ARF-GEP100 (8Jackson C.L. Casanova J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 60-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 9Someya A. Sata M. Takeda K. Pacheco-Rodriguez G. Ferrans V. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2413-2418Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These ARF GEFs are insensitive to brefeldin A and appear to be involved in ARF6-mediated membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal reorganization. The cytohesin family of ARF GEFs (cytohesin 1, cytohesin 2/ARNO (ARFnucleotide binding site opener), cytohesin 3/GRP1 (general receptor for phosphoinositides 1), and cytohesin 4) consist of a central catalytic Sec7 domain flanked by a C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and an N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain (5Jackson T.R.

However, the functional consequences of these interactions have not been fully determined, although Cybr has been shown to enhance cytohesin 1 ARF GEF activity in vitro (25Tang P. Cheng T. Agnello D.

We report here the characterization of a novel protein termed IPCEF1 (interaction protein for cytohesin exchange factors 1) that has been identified by a yeast two-hybrid screen of a rat brain cDNA library using cytohesin 2 as bait. IPCEF1 associates with cytohesin 2 and localizes to the cytosol in intact cells and translocates with cytohesin 2 to the plasma membrane of cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) where it modulates the ARF6 GEF activity of cytohesin 2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals—All chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise specified. DNA restriction enzymes were from Roche Applied Science.Plasmids—Full-length human cytohesin 2 and its deletion mutant cDNA sequences were amplified by PCR using cytohesin 2/pEGFPC1 plasmid as a template (11Venkateswarlu K.

The full-length cytohesin 4 cDNA was amplified from mammalian gene collection clone 48780 by PCR using sense primer 5′-CGCGAATTCATGGACCTGTGCCACCCAGAGCCCG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CGCGTCGACTCACTGCTTGCTGGCAATCTTC-3′ containing EcoRI (underlined) and SalI (underlined) sites, respectively. The cDNA was then digested with EcoRI and SalI and ligated to pGEX-4T1. Bait constructs encoding human cytohesins 1, 3, and 4 and centaurin-α1 were prepared by subcloning the full-length sequences from the respective pGEX constructs into pBTM116 vector. IPCEF1 and its deletion mutant sequences were isolated by PCR using IPCEF1/pGEMT (see below) and the following sets of primers containing EcoRI (sense, underlined) and SalI (antisense, underlined) sites, digested with EcoRI-SalI, and cloned into the same sites of pGAD424 (Clontech) for expression as GAL4 activation domain (AD) fusion proteins in yeast cells and pCMV-tag2 (Stratagene) for expression as FLAG-tagged proteins in mammalian cells: IPCEF1 FL (IPCEF1 full-length, 1–406 aa), sense primer 5′-CGCGAATTCATGAGTCGGAGAAGGATATCCTG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CGCGTCGACAAGAGAATTTTCCACACAGTCAG-3′; ΔN101 (IPCEF1, 102–406 aa), sense primer 5′-CGCGAATTCATGTGGCTAAACAAACTTGGATTTG-3′ and IPCEF1 FL antisense primer; ΔN188 (IPCEF1, 189–406 aa), sense primer 5′-CGCGAATTCATGAAAGAAAGACAGTCGTGGCTTG-3′ and IPCEF1 FL antisense primer; ΔN285 (IPCEF1, 286–406 aa), sense primer 5′-CGCGAATTCATGGAGAAACTGTACAAGTCATTG-3′ and IPCEF1 FL antisense primer; and ΔC121 (IPCEF1, 1–285 aa), IPCEF1 FL sense primer and antisense primer 5′-CGCGTCGACCTCATCGTCTTCGGCGATTTTAT-3′. ARF6-HA/pXS construct, kindly provided by Dr. J. Donaldson (National Institutes of Health), was used to express ARF6 with a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag in mammalian cells. ARF6-HA/pXS was also used as a template to isolate full-length ARF6 by PCR using forward (5′-CTAGCCATGGGGAAGGTGCTATCCAAAATC-3′) and reverse (5′-CGGAATTCGAGATTTGTAGTTAGAGGTTAACC-3′) primers containing NcoI (underlined) and EcoRI (underlined) restriction sites, respectively. The PCR product was digested with NcoI-EcoRI and cloned into the same sites of pTric-His2b (Novagen) for expression of protein with a C-terminal His6 epitope tag in E. coli. Similarly the full-length metallothionein 2A (MT2A) cDNA was amplified from mammalian gene collection clone 12397 by PCR using sense (5′-CGCGAATTCATGGACCCCAACTGCTCCTGCGCCGC-3′) and antisense (5′-CGCGTCGACGGCGCAGCAGCTGCACTTGTCCG-3′) primers having EcoRI (underlined) and SalI (underlined) sites, respectively. The cDNA was digested with EcoRI-SalI and ligated to pGEX-4T1 for expression as GST fusion protein in E. coli. pBB131 plasmid encoding yeast N-myristoyltransferase (obtained from Prof. J. I. Gordon, Washington University) was used to myristoylate ARF6 in E. coli. The authenticity of all constructs was verified by nucleotide sequencing using an ABI Prism 211 automated sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All bait constructs tested negative for autoactivation of reporter gene activity in the yeast two-hybrid reporter strain L40 (contains HIS3 and β-galactosidase reporters) (29Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar).Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed as described previously (31Stephens D.J. Banting G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30080-30086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, yeast strain L40 was first transformed with cytohesin 2/pBTM116 construct and then with a rat brain pGAD10 cDNA library (Clontech) using the lithium chloride method (31Stephens D.J. Banting G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30080-30086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The transformation mixture was grown overnight at 30 °C in synthetic medium lacking tryptophan and leucine to select the transformants carrying the plasmids. A total of 10 million transformants were assayed for growth on synthetic medium in the absence of histidine, leucine, and tryptophan. Positive colonies were then reassayed for growth on the histidine-lacking medium and for β-galactosidase activity. β-Galactosidase filter assays were carried out as described previously (46). The pGAD plasmids were recovered from the transformed yeast colonies using E. coli strain HB101 as a recipient strain and selecting on M9 minimal medium. The cDNA inserts of the recovered plasmids were sequenced as described above. The 5′ coding sequence of IPCEF1 was obtained by 5′-end rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE) from the Marathon-Ready cDNA library of rat brain (Clontech) using antisense primer 5′-GTCCCACATCTTCGGTAGCAGGCGA-3′ (741–765 base pairs of IPCEF1) and an adapter sense primer provided with the library. The 5′-RACE was carried out as described in the manufacturer's manual. The RACE product was sequenced and then ligated to the truncated IPCEF1 cDNA to obtain a full-length cDNA by PCR. The PCR product was cloned into pGEMT vector (Promega) and sequenced as described.Gene Expression Analysis—Expression of IPCEF1 gene in various rat tissues was analyzed by amplifying a 375-base pair 3′-translated region of IPCEF1 from the multiple tissue cDNA panel (Clontech) by PCR (94 °C for 1 min; 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min; and 68 °C for 5 min) using the IPCEF1ΔN285 sense and IPCEF1 FL antisense primers (described above) and DNA polymerase (Clontech). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression in multiple tissue cDNA was also analyzed by PCR using sequence-specific primers provided by the manufacturers.Cell Culture and Transfection—COS and normal rat kidney (NRK) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 2 mm glutamine in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. COS and NRK cells were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA using the liposomal transfection reagent FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) at a ratio of 4 μl of reagent/1 μg of DNA according to the manufacturer's instructions.GST Fusion Protein Pull-down Assay—COS cells were plated into 100-mm Petri dishes and allowed to grow to 70–80% confluency. Then they were transfected with FLAG-tagged full-length IPCEF1 or its deletion mutant-encoding plasmids (5 μg of DNA). After 48 h of transfection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture, Sigma). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. 90% of the cell extract was incubated with 20 μg of GST or GST-fused protein coupled to glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed three times with the lysis buffer and boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Whatman) and probed with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). GST fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) according to the method described previously (12Venkateswarlu K. Gunn-Moore F. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).Co-immunoprecipitation—COS cells were co-transfected with GFP or GFP-cytohesin 2 and FLAG or FLAG-tagged full-length IPCEF1 plasmids (1:1 ratio, 10 μg of total DNA). After 2 days, COS cells were lysed as described above, and the cell extracts were incubated with 5 μg of anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Clontech) for 30 min at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were incubated with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C and washed five times with lysis buffer. The bound protein was detected by immunoblotting using anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody. To examine the interaction of FLAG-IPCEF1 with endogenous cytohesin 2, NRK cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged IPCEF1 plasmid, and cell extracts were prepared as described above. The cell extracts of NRK cells were incubated with 10 μl of preimmune serum or anti-cytohesin 2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells extracts of NRK cells were also incubated with GST or GST-cytohesin 2 CC for 60 min and then with 10 μl of anti-FLAG monoclonal M2 antibody (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were incubated with 30 μl of protein A- or protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C and washed five times with lysis buffer. The bound protein was detected as described above with an anti-cytohesin 2 polyclonal antibody.In Vitro ARF6 Activation Assay—Myristoylated ARF6 with His6 tag at the C terminus was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) strain by cotransforming with yeast N-myristoyltransferase plasmid (pBB131) and purified using a Ni2+ affinity column (Novagen) according to the procedure described previously by Glenn et al. (32Glenn D.E. Thomas G.M. O'Sullivan A.J. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2023-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). GST-cytohesin 2 and GST-IPCEF1 recombinant proteins were prepared as described previously (12Venkateswarlu K. Gunn-Moore F. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). [35S]GTPγS binding to recombinant myristoylated ARF6 was performed in triplicate using a rapid filtration procedure (33Kliche S.

Briefly, 50 μl of the reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 1 μm ARF6, 4 μm [35S]GTPγS (0.2 μCi), and 50 μg of liposomes (70% phosphatidylcholine, 30% phosphatidylglycerol, and 5% PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) was incubated with either GST (200 nm), GST-cytohesin 2 (50 nm), GST-IPCEF1 (10–200 nm), or GST-cytohesin 2 (50 nm) + GST-IPCEF1 (10–200 nm) at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped at the indicated times by adding 1.5 ml of ice-cold washing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2) to each reaction tube. Samples were filtered through nitrocellulose membranes in a vacuum manifold (Millipore). The filters were washed three times with 2 ml of ice-cold washing buffer and dried. Scintillation fluid was added to the filters, and they were counted in a Beckman LS 5000 β-counter to quantify the amount of [35S]GTPγS-bound protein.In Vivo ARF6 Activation Assay—This assay was performed as described previously (34Schweitzer J.K. D'Souza-Schorey C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27210-27216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). COS cells transfected with ARF6-HA, GFP, or GFP-cytohesin 2 and FLAG or FLAG-tagged full-length IPCEF1 plasmids (3:1:1 ratio, 10 μg of total DNA) were serum-starved for 2 h and incubated for 5 min with or without 200 ng/ml EGF. In some experiments 8 μg of ARF6-HA, 2 μg of GFP-cytohesin 2, 5–0 μg of FLAG, and 0–5 μg of FLAG-IPCEF1 vectors were used for transfection. The cells were then lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)).

https://openalex.org/W2127621151,"It has been proposed that the activation status of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) plays a significant role in the development of autoimmune disease. Whether expression of costimulatory ligands on tissue-resident APCs controls organ-specific autoimmune responses has not been tested. We here report that transgenic mice constitutively expressing the costimulatory ligand B7.2/CD86 on microglia in the central nervous system (CNS) and on related cells in the proximal peripheral nervous tissue spontaneously develop autoimmune demyelinating disease. Disease-affected nervous tissue in transgenic mice showed infiltration characterized by a predominance of CD8+ memory-effector T cells, as well as CD4+ T cells. Transgenic animals lacking alphabeta TCR+ T cells were completely resistant to disease development. Transgenic T cells induced disease when adoptively transferred into T cell-deficient B7.2 transgenic recipients but not into non-transgenic recipients. These data provide evidence that B7/CD28 interactions within the nervous tissue are critical determinants of disease development. Our findings have important implications for understanding the etiology of nervous system autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS)."
https://openalex.org/W2005802272,"The β subunits of voltage-dependent calcium channels are known to modify calcium channel currents through pore-forming α1 subunits. Of the four β subunits reported to date, the β3 subunit is highly expressed in smooth muscle cells and is thought to consist of L-type calcium channels. To determine the role of the β3 subunit in the voltage-dependent calcium channels of the cardiovascular system in situ, we performed a series of experiments in β3-null mice. Western blot analysis indicated a significant reduction in expression of the α1 subunit in the plasma membrane of β3-null mice. Dihydropyridine binding experiments also revealed a significant decrease in the calcium channel population in the aorta. Electrophysiological analyses indicated a 30% reduction in Ca2+ channel current density, a slower inactivation rate, and a decreased dihydropyridine-sensitive current in β3-null mice. The reductions in the peak current density and inactivation rate were reproduced in vitro by co-expression of the calcium channel subunits in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Despite the reduced channel population, β3-null mice showed normal blood pressure, whereas a significant reduction in dihydropyridine responsiveness was observed. A high salt diet significantly elevated blood pressure only in the β3-null mice and resulted in hypertrophic changes in the aortic smooth muscle layer and cardiac enlargement. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the involvement and importance of the β3 subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels in the cardiovascular system and in regulating channel populations and channel properties in vascular smooth muscle cells.

Voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) 1The abbreviations used are: VDCCs, Voltage-dependent calcium channels; DHP, dihydropyridine; RyR, ryanodine-sensitive calcium release; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; RT, reverse transcriptase; GFP, green fluorescent protein. are the main mediators of calcium entry in many cell types and play pivotal roles in the control of calcium-dependent cellular functions, such as smooth muscle contraction. These channels are classified electrophysiologically and pharmacologically into five groups (L, N, T, R, and P/Q). L-type calcium channels are crucial for excitation-contraction coupling as voltage sensors in skeletal muscle and as the main mediators of calcium entry in heart and smooth muscle tissues. VDCCs are composed of four subunits, α1, α2, δ, β, and γ (1Hofmann F. Biel M. Flockerzi F. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 399-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 2Catterall W.A. Annu.

The α1 subunits are the pore-forming subunits and are targets of calcium channel blockers such as dihydropyridines (DHPs), phenylalkylamines, and benzothiazepines, which are widely used for the treatment of hypertension, angina pectoris, and cardiac arrhythmias. Ten genes encoding pore-forming α1 subunits have been reported to date (3Perez-Reyes E. Cribbs L.L. Daud A. Lacerda A.E. Barclay J. Williamson M.P. Fox M. Rees M. Lee J.-H. Nature. 1998; 391: 896-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). The β subunits accelerate activation and inactivation of calcium channel currents, increase the channel population, and influence the coupling of gating charge movement; in addition, the βγ dimer (Gβγ) is thought to be involved in G protein-mediated channel inhibition (4Pragnell M.

The β subunits are non-glycosylated hydrophilic proteins located on the intracellular side of the membrane; four variants are known (β1, β2, β3, and β4). Due to its wide expression in the aorta, trachea, and lung, β3 is considered the β subunit of smooth muscle calcium channels; it is also thought to couple with α1C subunits and comprise L-type calcium channels in these cells (9Hullin R.

Although the role of the β subunits has been investigated by heterologous co-expression studies and antisense experiments with cultured cells, little is known about the physiological importance of the β3 subunit in situ. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the importance of the voltage-dependent calcium channel β3 subunit in the cardiovascular system by using gene-targeted mutant mice. We examined channel populations in the aorta, calcium channel currents in aortic smooth muscle cells, calcium sparks in response to high KCl, and expression patterns of calcium channel subunits in the cardiovascular system of β3-null mice. We also measured blood pressure and heart rate in β3-null mice and compared them with wild-type controls. β3-Null mice showed high blood pressure, hypertrophic changes in the aortic smooth muscle layer, and cardiac enlargement in response to a high salt diet. The wild-type (β3+/+) and β3-deficient (β3–/–) mice were 12–16-week-old experimentally naive mice (11Murakami M. Yamamura H. Murakami A. Okamura T. Nunoki K. Mistui-Saito M. Muraki K. Hano K.

Animals were maintained at 22 ± 0.5 °C under a 12-h light-dark cycle. All experiments were conducted during the light phase of the cycle. RNA Isolation and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from the mouse aorta using an RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription reaction was performed in a solution of 10 pmol of oligo(dT) primer, 1 μg of RNA, 1× first strand cDNA buffer (Invitrogen), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm dNTPs, 40 units of RNAsin, and 200 units of Superscript II (Invitrogen), in a volume of 25 μl, at 42 °C for 45 min. β3 and β2 subunit-specific sequences were amplified by PCR with the following primers: MB3S (5′-CTC AAA CAG GAA CAG AAG GCC-3′) and MB3A (5′-CAT AGC CTT TCA GAG AGG GTC-3′), corresponding to the sequences of the murine β3 subunit 128LKQEQKAR136 and 184PSLKGYE191; MB2S (5′-CTA GAG AAC ATG AGG CTA CAG-3′) and MB2A (5′-ACT GTT TGC ACT GGG CTT AGG-3′), corresponding to the sequences of the murine β2 subunit 130LENMRLQ137 and 197PKPSANS204.

The membranes (0.2 mg/ml) were incubated in a final volume of 0.5 ml, in the dark, for 90 min at 25 °C, in the presence of (+)-[3H]PN 200-110 (84 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). The free ligand concentration was varied between 0.05 and 1.2 nm. Nonspecific binding was defined using nicardipine (1.0 μm). Incubation was terminated by rapid filtration on Whatman GF/B filters and by washing the filters six times with 2 ml of ice-cold buffer. The retained radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Patch Clamp Recording—Whole-cell recordings were made as described previously (16Imaizumi Y. Muraki K. Watanabe M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1990; 427: 301-324Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Isolated cells from the aorta were voltage-clamped in whole-cell mode using a patch clamp amplifier EPC-7 (List, Lambrecht, Germany). The pipettes (3–5 megohms) were filled with a solution containing 140 mm CsCl, 4.0 mm MgCl2, 5.0 mm EGTA, 5.0 mm Na2ATP, and 10 mm HEPES. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 with 1 n CsOH. The bath solution contained 92 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 30 mm BaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 14 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 with 10 n NaOH. Whole-cell currents were elicited by 150-ms voltage clamp steps, from –50 to +60 mV, every 15 s, from the holding potential of –60 mV. Whole-cell currents were displayed without any leak subtraction, and membrane potentials have been corrected for junction potentials according to the method of Neher (17Neher E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 207: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). Cell capacitance was measured by dividing the charge (Q) during the capacitative surge elicited by 10 mV hyperpolarization (ΔV) from –60 mV, using the equation Cm = Q/ΔV. Data acquisition and analysis were done on a computer using software (Cell Soft) developed at the University of Calgary, Canada. Pooled data are shown as the mean ± S.E. The statistical significance of differences between β3+/+ and β3–/– mice was determined using Student's unpaired t test. Calcium Spark Measurement—The first branch mesenteric arteries (300–500 μm in diameter, 5 mm in length) were removed and placed into ice-cold, oxygenated (95% O2, 5% CO2) Krebs solution containing 112 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 0.023 mm EDTA, and 14 mm glucose (pH 7.4). The endothelium of the artery was gently wiped off. The arterial segment was incubated with Krebs solution containing 10 μm fluo-3-AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), 0.09% pluronic F-127, and 1 μm wortmannin, a myosin light chain kinase inhibitor, to suppress the movement of smooth muscle cells at room temperature (24 ± 1 °C) for 60 min. After incubation, the arterial strip was placed in the recording chamber using a stainless steel ring and was continuously perfused with standard HEPES-buffered solution at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Standard HEPES-buffered solution has an ionic composition of 137 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 14 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES. The pH of the solutions was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Arteries were imaged using a fast scanning confocal microscope (Nikon RCM-8000; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an objective lens (Fluor 40 × 1.15 NA, water immersion, Nikon). The excitation wavelength from an argon ion laser was 488 nm, and the emission wavelength was 515 nm. The resolution of the microscope was ∼0.33 × 0.27 (1 pixel) and ∼2.2 μm in the z axis direction. The Ca2+ image required 33 ms to scan a full frame (512 × 512 pixels) and took 3.3 s to obtain 100 images in each trial at room temperature. Depolarization stimuli were applied by perfusion with HEPES-buffered solution containing 30 mm KCl. Pooled data are shown as the means ± S.E. The statistical significance of differences between groups was determined using Scheffé's test after one-way analysis of variance. Measurement of Blood Pressure—Mice were age-matched between the groups and were trained several times before measurements. The heart rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were measured using an automated computerized system with the tail-cuff method (BP-98A; Softron, Tokyo, Japan). The animals were fed the high salt diet for 2 weeks before the experiments. Multivariate differences were analyzed by repeated measured analysis of variance. Results are given as means ± S.E. Tissue Preparation and Histology—Tissues of β3+/+ and β3–/– mice were excised under ether anesthesia. The tissues were fixed immediately in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) overnight at 4 °C and embedded in paraffin wax. Histological examination of slides stained with hematoxylin-eosin was performed. Immunohistology—Immunohistochemical analysis was performed using the streptavidin-biotin amplification method. After deparaffinization, slides were treated with Pronase. The antigen-antibody complex was visualized as a brown precipitate with 3.3′-diaminobenzidine solution (1 mm diaminobenzidine, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6), and 0.006% H2O2), and counterstaining was performed with hematoxylin. Normal goat serum (1%) was applied to the sections for 20 min at room temperature, followed by the primary antibody at a dilution of 1:200 for 18 h at 4 °C. Commercially available antibodies that specifically recognize the α1C subunit (Alomone, Jerusalem, Israel) were used. Sections were reacted with Envision plus (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) to visualize the antigen-antibody complex. Whole-cell immunofluorescence labeling of isolated smooth muscle cells was tested with anti-β3 antibody at a dilution of 1:100 (Alomone) as the primary antibody, and further analyzed with fluorescein-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG at a dilution of 1:200. Electrophysiology with CHO Cells—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. For electrical recordings, CHO cells at 30–50% confluence were plated onto 22-mm coverslips. Some CHO cells were transfected with an expression vector carrying the cloned smooth muscle α1C subunit (Cav1.2b) in pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) and/or the β2a in pTracer (Invitrogen) and/or the β3 subunit in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) with or without a green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression vector (pTracer) by lipofection (Superfect Transfection Reagent; Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan) (18Bosse E. Bottlender R. Kleppisch T. Hescheler J. Welling A. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2033-2038Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Expression of the channel subunits was quantified by the emission of green light using an IX70 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Whole-cell patch clamp recording was carried out 48–72 h after transfection. Whole-cell currents were elicited by 3000-ms voltage clamp steps, from the holding potential at –60 to +10 mV every 15 s. Statistics—The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. Differences were evaluated using unpaired t tests, unless stated otherwise. The level of statistical significance was p < 0.05. β3 and β2 are Expressed in the Murine Aorta—RNA products derived from β3+/+ and β3–/– mice were analyzed using the β3-specific primers, MB3S and MB3A, and β2-specific primers, MB2S and MB2A. RT-PCR analysis of the wild-type aorta showed β3- and β2-specific bands of 187 and 222 bp, respectively (Fig. 1A), indicating the expression of both subunits in this tissue. We also performed the experiment with β1- and β4-specific primers, which yielded no PCR products (data not shown). The expression of the α1C subunit gene was confirmed in both wild-type and mutant mice. We also confirmed the expression of β2, β3, and α1C subunit genes with other primer sets. Moreover, we also performed the experiment with primers for other α1 subunits thought to participate in the formation of high voltage-activated calcium channels, such as α1A, but PCR yielded no products with these primers. Western Blot Analysis—To confirm the deficiency of the β3 subunit and the expression of the β2 subunit in the aortic tissue at the protein level, we performed Western blot analysis using anti-β2, anti-β3, and anti-α1C subunit antibodies. A single band corresponding to β3 was detected in β3+/+ mice, whereas no corresponding band was detected in β3–/– mice (Fig. 1B). Anti-β2 antibody detected a single band of 84 kDa in β3+/+ mice, indicating β2 subunit expression and suggesting that this subunit is a component of voltage-dependent calcium channels in the vascular tissue. There was no significant difference in the level of β2 subunit expression in the aortas of β3–/– mice, as compared with β3+/+ controls, suggesting that there was no compensatory increase in the level of β2 expression in this tissue. On Western blot analysis, a single band with a molecular mass of 210 kDa was detected in the aortas of β3+/+ and β3–/– mice with the anti-α1C subunit antibody. We also performed Western blot analysis with anti-pan α1 antibody, with the same results, suggesting that the majority of calcium channels are encoded by a single α1C subunit gene that forms VDCCs in the mammalian cardiovascular system. β3–/– mice showed a reduced amount of the α1C subunit in the aortic plasma membrane (∼45% reduction as determined by densitometry), which suggested a decrease in the channel population in the smooth muscle cell membrane by the targeted disruption of the β3 subunit gene. Binding Studies—To characterize further the decrease in the channel population, we next performed saturation binding analyses using the dihydropyridine derivative (+)-[3H]PN 200-110, which binds to a saturable, non-interacting set of binding sites in aortic smooth muscle membranes. Fig. 1C shows typical results from a saturation experiment. The Kd values were 0.248 ± 0.072 nm (β3+/+, n = 4) and 0.257 ± 0.064 nm (β3–/–, n = 4), and the B max values were 8.27 ± 0.51 fmol/mg protein (β3+/+) and 3.68 ± 0.42 fmol/mg protein (β3–/–) (Fig. 1C, inset), suggesting a decrease in the number of DHP receptors in the cell membrane (∼56% reduction) of the mutant mice, with no apparent changes in the channel affinity. This 56% reduction in the channel population coincided with a similar reduction in the level of expression of α1 subunits detected by Western blot analysis. The nonspecific binding values were quite high (about 30%), which made subsequent Scatchard analysis difficult in comparison to skeletal muscle membrane preparations, whose nonspecific binding value was about 10% (Kd = 0.287 nm, B max = 401.15 fmol/mg protein). Reduction and Modulation of Voltage-dependent Calcium Channel Currents—Whole-cell patch clamping was used to examine the effect of β3 expression on voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel currents in freshly dissociated aortic smooth muscle cells. The mean cell capacitance was 26.9 ± 1.1 in β3+/+ cells and 24.4 ± 1.0 pF in β3–/– cells (13 cells from 7 mice for each, p > 0.05), respectively. Rectangular pulses (150-ms duration) of various potentials were applied in the presence of 30 mm Ba2+, as a charge carrier. Fig. 2A shows examples of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel currents. At positive test potentials, inward Ba2+ currents were observed in both β3+/+ and β3–/– cells (Fig. 2A). In Fig. 2B, the density of the peak inward current was plotted against the test potential (I-V relationship). The density of the voltage-dependent inward current was, however, maximal at +10 mV irrespective of β3 expression. A reduction of about 30% in the Ca2+-channel current density was observed in β3–/– cells (0.84 ± 0.08 pA/pF, n = 12 versus β3+/+, 1.22 ± 0.10 pA/pF, n = 7, p < 0.05), in which the peak current was observed at +10 mV (Fig. 2B). Next, DHP sensitivity was examined with nicardipine. In both groups, the inward currents were effectively inhibited by 100 nm nicardipine, but a significant decrease was observed in the DHP-sensitive component in β3–/– cells (0.61 ± 0.10 pA/pF, n = 7, p < 0.05 versus β3+/+, 0.99 ± 0.13 pA/pF, n = 7, Fig. 2C). By contrast, inactivation of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel current was significantly slower in β3–/– cells. The decay time constant of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel current evoked at +10 mV was well fitted by an exponential function; the time constant was 59.2 ± 6.2 and 109.1 ± 7.4 ms in β3+/+ cells (n = 7) and β3–/– cells (n = 12), respectively (p < 0.01, Fig. 2D). This is consistent with the observation that the inactivation was altered by different β subunits (9Hullin R. Singer-Lahat D. Freichel M. Biel M. Dascal N. Hofmann F. Flockerzi V. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Decreased Responsiveness to Diltiazem in Global [Ca2 + ]i and No Changes in Ca2 + Sparks—It has been suggested that VDCCs play an important role in coupling sparks and spontaneous transient outward currents, and that this coupling represents a negative feedback mechanism for regulating arterial tone. Therefore, Ca2+ sparks in intact mesenteric arteries were further examined. Fig. 3A shows typical recordings of Ca2+ changes in the first branch of a wild-type mesenteric artery, in response to 30 mm KCl. This elevation of external K+ increased global [Ca2+] i in both β3+/+ and β3–/– mice (F/F0 increases of 1.34- and 1.21-fold in β3+/+ and β3–/–, respectively; Fig. 3B). The decrease in the global [Ca2+]i in β3+/+ mice on application of an L-type calcium channel blocker, diltiazem, was significantly larger than that in β3–/– mice (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting decreased responsiveness to diltiazem in the mutants. However, there were no significant differences in the amplitudes of local [Ca2+] i transients (Ca2+ sparks, >100 ms in half-duration) between β3+/+ (n = 18) and β3–/– cells (n = 24) from 5 mice each in either standard or high KCl solutions or in the presence of diltiazem (Fig. 3D). The frequency of Ca2+ sparks was also not affected significantly by β3 deficiency (0.22 ± 0.05 and 0.18 ± 0.04 Hz in β3+/+ and β3–/– cells, respectively, in standard solution, p > 0.05). The characteristics of longer periodical Ca2+ events (Ca2+ waves) were also detected in these preparations. The amplitude (F/F0) and frequency were 1.79 ± 0.03 and 0.13 ± 0.05 Hz, respectively, in β3+/+ cells (13 cells from 5 mice) and were not significantly different from those in β3–/– cells (1.98 ± 0.16 and 0.15 ± 0.04 Hz, respectively, 14 cells from 5 mice). Immunohistological Examination of the α 1C Subunit in the Heart and Aorta—To evaluate the decrease in channel population identified by Western blot and DHP binding analyses, we examined the distribution of the α1C subunit, of which the majority of L-type channels in the heart and aorta is comprised. The α1C subunit is distributed homogeneously in the heart and aortic smooth muscle cell layer. There were no clear differences in the patterns of immunohistological labeling between wildtype and mutant mice (Fig. 4A). Conventional immunohistological labeling with streptavidin-biotin amplification did not allow us to detect the distribution of the β3 subunit, as the levels of background signals were high. Therefore, we examined expression of the β3 subunit by whole-cell fluorescence immunohistochemical analysis in isolated aortic smooth muscle cells (Fig. 4B, left panels). In the wild-type mice (Fig. 4Bi), a homogeneous distribution of the β3 subunit was observed, whereas only background signals were detected in β3–/– mice (Fig. 4Bii, inset has high signal intensification, resulting in high background signals). The corresponding phase contrast images are shown in the right panels. Decreased Responsiveness to Amlodipine and Salt-sensitive Increase in Blood Pressure—The significance of the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels in the cardiovascular system is widely known, and its blockers, such as DHP, are widely used in the treatment of hypertension. Therefore, decreased blood pressure was anticipated, but no significant differences were observed in systolic or diastolic blood pressure in β3–/– mice on normal diets, as compared with wild-type controls. We also measured blood pressure using arterial catheters. As there were no significant differences in the results obtained using the tail-cuff and intra-arterial methods, we used the tail-cuff method for subsequent measurements. Intraperitoneal injection of amlodipine (1.0 mg/kg), a DHP analogue significantly lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure in β3+/+ mice, whereas it had no significant effect in β3–/– mice (Table I).Table I+/+, β3+/+ without treatment; -/-, β3-/- without treatment; +/+ amlodipine (amlo), β3+/+ 60 min after injection of amlodipine (1.0 mg/kg); -/-, β3-/- 60 min after injection of amlodipine (1.0 mg/kg); +/+ NaCl, β3+/+ after 2 weeks of NaCl loading; -/- NaCl, β3-/- after 2 weeks of NaCl loading.

Open table in a new tab As high dietary salt intake in humans is associated with high blood pressure (19John S.W.M. Krege J.H. Oliver P.M. Hagaman J.R. Hodgin J.B. Pang S.C. Flynn T.G. Smithies O. Science. 1995; 267: 679-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar), we next examined the effects of a high salt diet, containing 8% NaCl, on the blood pressure of β3+/+ and β3–/– mice. Loading with the high salt diet for 2 weeks increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure in β3–/– mice but not in β3+/+ mice (Table I). Loading with the high salt diet for 3 months induced hypertrophic changes in the aortic smooth muscle of β3–/– mice (Fig. 4C), whereas no significant changes were observed in β3+/+ mice. Mutant β3–/– mice on the high salt diet also showed an increase in heart weight (Fig. 4D). As these pathological changes are common features in hypertensive animals, they may have been a consequence of elevated blood pressure. Electrophysiological Recordings of Transiently Transfected Cav1.2b-expressing CHO Cells—To analyze further the importance of β subunits in the voltage-dependent calcium channels in smooth muscle cells, we next analyzed transient expression of the Cav1.2b, β2, and β3 subunits in CHO cells. Fig. 5A shows representative whole-cell Ca2+ channel currents recorded using Ba2+ as the charge carrier. A rectangular 10-mV pulse (3000 ms in duration) was applied. The mean cell capacitance was 16.0 ± 0.4 pF. To examine whether transfection itself influences the Ca2+ channel current, we first transfected CHO cells with a GFP plasmid alone (pTracer). This mock transfection had no effect on voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel currents (Fig. 5Ai). The voltage-dependent inward Ca2+ channel current (Fig. 5Aii) was recorded from CHO cells transiently expressing α1C (Cav1.2b) with GFP plasmid (α1C/Mock). In the CHO cells expressing α1C, the current density estimated from the peak inward current at 10 mV (PCD10mV) was 10.7 ± 0.5 pA/pF (n = 8). The voltage-dependent inward current decayed very slowly during depolarization (time constant, 868.0 ± 11.8 ms, n = 8). These features are es"

The inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunit Kir5.1 exhibits highly selective heteromultimerization with Kir4.1 to generate heteromeric Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels with unique rectification and kinetic properties. These novel channels are also inhibited by intracellular pH within the physiological range and are thought to play a key role in linking K+ and H+ homeostasis by the kidney. However, the mechanisms that control heteromeric K+ channel assembly and the structural elements that generate their unique functional properties are poorly understood. In this study we identify residues at an intersubunit interface between the cytoplasmic domains of Kir5.1 and Kir4.1 that influence the novel rectification and gating properties of heteromeric Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels and that also contribute to their pH sensitivity. Furthermore, this interaction presents a structural mechanism for the functional coupling of these properties and explains how specific heteromeric interactions can contribute to the novel functional properties observed in heteromeric Kir channels. The highly conserved nature of this structural association between Kir subunits also has implications for understanding the general mechanisms of Kir channel gating and their regulation by intracellular pH.

The highly conserved nature of this structural association between Kir subunits also has implications for understanding the general mechanisms of Kir channel gating and their regulation by intracellular pH. Inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels are not only important for the regulation of the resting membrane potential and cellular electrical activity but are also key regulators of K+ transport processes throughout the body (1Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 2Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 503-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). One such example of their critical role in K+ transport and homeostasis is in the polarized epithelia of the renal tubules. Some 95% of dietary K+ absorbed by the intestine is excreted via the kidney and thus control of this process is one of the key mechanisms of K+ homeostasis. Kir channels in the apical membrane are responsible for the secretion of excess K+, whereas in the basolateral membrane they maintain the negative membrane potential and allow K+ to recycle via the Na+/K+-ATPase powering most of the transepithelial solute and fluid transport (3Giebisch G. Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 436-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The apical secretory K+ channel in the distal nephron of the kidney is Kir1.1 (ROMK1) (3Giebisch G. Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 436-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas one of the basolateral Kir channels has recently been identified as a heteromeric Kir4.0/Kir5.1 channel (4Lourdel S. Paulais M. Cluzeaud F. Bens M. Tanemoto M. Kurachi Y. Vandewalle A. Teulon J. J. Physiol. 2002; 538: 391-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A key property of these Kir1.1, Kir4.0, and heteromeric Kir4.0/Kir5.1 channels is their inhibition by H+ within the physiological range, thus making them highly sensitive linkers between K+ and H+ homeostasis (5Tsai T.D. Shuck M.E. Thompson D.P. Bienkowski M.J. Lee K.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1173-C1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Yang Z. Jiang C. J.

Imbrici P. D'Adamo M.C. Salvatore L. Tucker S.J. J. Physiol. 2001; 532: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This functional linkage allows coordinate regulation of both apical and basolateral K+ channels, as well as providing a mechanism to prevent excessive loss of K+ during metabolic acidosis (3Giebisch G. Kidney Int. 2001; 60: 436-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which these channels sense intracellular pH is unclear, but it is thought to require the presence of a lysine residue in a particular position within the first transmembrane domain (Lys-80 in Kir1.1 and Lys-67 in Kir4.1). It has been proposed that this lysine residue exhibits anomalous titration and therefore functions directly as the H+ sensor (11Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Sculte U. Brandle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 12Schulte U. Hahn H. Konrad M. Jeck N. Derst C. Wild K. Weidemann S. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Ludwig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15298-15303Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Heteromeric Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels are much more sensitive to intracellular pH than Kir4.1 homomeric channels (Kir4.1 pKa = 6.1 compared with pKa = 7.4 for Kir4.1/Kir5.1) (10Pessia M. Imbrici P. D'Adamo M.C. Salvatore L. Tucker S.J. J. Physiol. 2001; 532: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, Kir5.1 does not possess a lysine residue at this equivalent position (Met-73) and the pH sensitivity of the heteromeric Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels is principally determined by the Kir4.1 subunit. Thus, heteromultimerization with Kir5.1 somehow modulates the “intrinsic pH sensor” within Kir4.1 and this must involve some form of specific heteromeric interaction between these subunits (10Pessia M. Imbrici P. D'Adamo M.C. Salvatore L. Tucker S.J. J. Physiol. 2001; 532: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The ability of Kir subunits to heteromultimerize with Kir5.1 is highly restricted, only Kir4.1 and Kir4.2 physically associate with Kir5.1 and we have recently shown that a small domain within the C terminus of Kir4.1 contributes to the specificity of this interaction (13Konstas A. Korbmacher C. Tucker S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C910-C917Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Highly selective heteromultimerization is important because individual cells express many different Kir subunits. Thus, for these cells to maintain distinct subpopulations of both homo- and heteromeric Kir channels it is essential that mechanisms exist to prevent random or promiscuous interactions. Heteromultimerization between Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 also produces an increase in single-channel conductance, an increase in rectification, and very slow time-dependent activation at hyperpolarizing potentials compared with homomeric Kir4.1 (14Pessia M.

This time-dependent activation is one of the most characteristic features of Kir4.1/Kir5.1 heteromeric channels. Although other heteromeric Kir channels (e.g. Kir3.1/Kir3.4) also exhibit time-dependent activation, the activation of the Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels is on a much slower time scale and takes several seconds to reach a steady-state current at –120 mV (τ = 2 s compared with 300 ms for Kir3.1/Kir3.4) (15Kofuji P. Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Physiol. 1996; 490: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which heteromultimerization between Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 produces such novel biophysical properties remains unclear, neither is it understood how Kir5.1 influences the pH sensor in Kir4.1. In this study we have identified an intersubunit interface between the intracellular domains of Kir4.1 and Kir5.1, which influences the inward rectification, time-dependent activation, and pH sensitivity of Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels. The results also reveal a functional linkage between these different properties and demonstrate how dynamic interactions between the intracellular domains can influence Kir channel permeation, gating, and regulation. Molecular Biology—All channel subunits were subcloned into the oocyte expression vector pBF, which provides 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions from the Xenopus β-globin gene flanking a polylinker containing multiple restriction sites. Kir subunits were joined in tandem as previously described (14Pessia M. Tucker S.J. Lee K. Bond C.T. Adelman J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2980-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This method controls the stoichiometry of the heteromeric channels and does not affect channel function (7Tucker S.J. Imbrici P. Salvatore L. D'Adamo M.C. Pessia M. J. Biol.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange XL protocol (Stratagene). Capped mRNAs were synthesized in vitro by using the SP6 mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion). Molecular Modeling—Coordinates of the Kir3.1 structure (Protein Data Bank code 1N9P) were used to produce the models shown in Fig. 5. Visualization and rendering of the structure was done using the RasTop program. 1www.geneinfinity.org/rastop. Electrophysiology: Two-electrode Voltage-Clamp Recording—Xenopus laevis care and handling were in accordance with the highest standards of institutional guidelines in compliance with both national and international laws and policies. Frogs underwent no more than two surgeries, separated by at least 3 weeks. Frogs were anesthetized with an aerated solution of 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. Standard recording solution contained 90 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) unless otherwise stated. Intracellular acidification was achieved using a potassium acetate buffering system (16Choe H. Zhou H. Palmer G. Sackin H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F516-F529PubMed Google Scholar). Only one pH/inhibition value per cell was determined in two-electrode voltage-clamp experiments. Measurement of pH sensitivity using this method was less accurate than measurement in excised patches because of the activity of Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels in the pH 7.5–8.0 range and the inability to alkalinize the intracellular pH of the oocytes. Nevertheless, the values recorded provide a quantitative indication of the response to acidification below pH 7.5. Microelectrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of 0.1–0.5 megaohms. Recordings were performed at 22 °C, 18–48 h after injection with a GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments) interfaced to a Power Macintosh 7200/90 computer with an ITC-16 computer interface (Instrutech Corp., New York). Currents were evoked by voltage commands from a holding potential of –10 mV, delivered in –10 mV increments from +50 mV to –120 mV, unless otherwise stated. The inward rectification factor (Fir) represents the inward current at –50 mV divided by the outward current at +50 mV (E rev ∼0 mV). Data were given as mean ± S.E. Results were reproducible in three different batches of oocytes. A Mutation in Kir5.1 Influences the Time-dependent Activation of Kir4.1/Kir5.1 Channels—To understand the structural features of Kir5.1 that contribute to the novel properties of heteromeric Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels we examined an alignment of different Kir channel sequences. This alignment (Fig. 1) reveals that Kir5.1 has a positively charged arginine residue at position 230, whereas all other known Kir channels possess a negatively charged glutamate. We therefore mutated this residue in Kir5.1(R230E) and coexpressed this with Kir4.1 as a Kir4.1-Kir5.1(R230E) tandemly linked dimer. Macroscopic whole cell currents were then recorded by two-electrode voltage-clamp from Xenopus oocytes expressing Kir4.1-Kir5.1-(R230E). Fig. 2A shows that wild-type Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels exhibit characteristic time-dependent activation at hyperpolarizing potentials and strong inward rectification. By contrast, the mutant Kir4.1-Kir5.1(R230E) channels exhibit no time-dependent activation and weaker rectification (Fig. 2, B and C). Similar effects were also observed with Kir4.1-Kir5.1(R230D) channels (Fig. 2, D and F). When Arg-230 was substituted with an equivalent positively charged lysine, the Kir4.1-Kir5.1-(R230K) channels demonstrated time-dependent activation similar to wild-type but with weaker rectification (Fig. 2, E and F).Fig. 2Mutation of Arg-230 in Kir5.1 alters inward rectification and gating.

To monitor the response of the channels to intracellular acidification we utilized a well established potassium acetate buffering system to modulate intracellular pH (16Choe H. Zhou H. Palmer G. Sackin H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F516-F529PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell currents were then recorded by two-electrode voltage-clamp from oocytes expressing either wild-type or Kir4.1/Kir5.1(R230E) mutant channels. Fig. 3B shows that there is no difference between the inhibition of the wild-type and mutant Kir4.1-Kir5.1(R230E) channels (pKa Kir4.1-Kir5.1 = 6.78 ± 0.04, n = 6, pKa Kir4.1-Kir5.1-(R230E) = 6.79 ± 0.04, n = 6). However, Fig. 3A shows that the slow time-dependent activation of the Kir4.1-Kir5.1(R230E) channels is pH-sensitive and reappears upon intracellular acidification. At pH 7.2 the channels exhibit no time-dependent activation, whereas at pH 6.8 the time-dependent component of activation reappears. The Kir4.1-Kir5.1(R230E) channels also exhibit stronger rectification at pH 6.8 (Fig. 3C). Because overall channel activity decreases with acidification we calculated an inward rectification “factor” (Fir) to compare inward rectification at different pH values (17Hommers L.G. Lohse M.J. Bunemann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1037-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fir represents the inward current at –50 mV divided by the outward current at +50 mV. Thus a larger Fir value represents stronger inward rectification. Fig. 3D shows that for the Kir4.1-Kir5.1(R230E) channels Fir increases by a factor of 3 between pH 7.2 and 6.8 (Fir pH 7.2 = 1.11 ± 0.10 n = 6; Fir pH 6.8 = 3.36 ± 0.50 n = 6). Fig. 4A shows that the time-dependent activation of both Kir4.1-Kir5.1(R230E) and Kir4.1-Kir5.1(R230D) channels “reappears” in response to intracellular acidification. Furthermore, it shows that the time-dependent activation of the wild-type Kir4.1-Kir5.1 channels is also pH-sensitive. The relative rates of activation for all these channels are shown in Fig. 4B. By contrast there is no effect of pH on the rectification of wild-type Kir4.1-Kir5.1 channels, although the Kir4.1-Kir5.1(R230D) channels demonstrate an increase in rectification at pH 6.8 (Fig. 4C). Arg-230 in Kir5.1 Forms an Intersubunit Interaction with Kir4.1—While conducting these studies a three-dimensional crystal structure of the intracellular domains of the Kir3.1 channel was resolved (18Nishida M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 2002; 111: 957-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The extensive homology between the C termini of the Kir channels means that the Kir3.1 structure can be used to interpret the arrangement of the intracellular domains of all Kir channels. The equivalent residue to Arg-230 in Kir5.1 is Glu-242 in Kir3.1. Fig. 5A shows that Glu-242 in Kir3.1 resides at the end of an extended “arm” on the C terminus. In the tetramer this arm forms close contacts with the adjacent C terminus and this is shown in Fig. 5B. This shows that Glu-242 in Kir3.1 is in close contact with Arg-326 and Arg-205 in the adjacent subunit. In a heteromeric Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channel these residues would reside on the Kir4.1 subunit and are represented by His-190 and Glu-310, respectively. It is interesting to note that His-190 resides within a small domain that we recently identified as a critical determinant of heteromeric assembly between Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 (13Konstas A. Korbmacher C. Tucker S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C910-C917Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The alignments in Fig. 1 show that at position 242 in Kir3.1 all known Kirs have a glutamate, whereas Kir5.1 has an arginine (Arg-230). Similarly at position 326 in Kir3.1, all known Kir channels have an arginine residue, whereas Kir4.1 and Kir4.2 have a glutamate. Because both Kir4.1 and Kir4.2 exhibit selective heteromultimerization with Kir5.1 it is possible that residues Glu-242 and Arg-326 in Kir3.1 represent an ion pair that is simply reversed in Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channels and which may contribute to their selective heteromeric assembly. In this case we would expect the Kir4.1(E310R) mutation to have the same functional consequences as the Kir5.1(R230E) mutation. We therefore tested the effect of a charge reversal at this position (E310R). However, the Kir4.1(E310R)/Kir5.1 channels behaved very similar to wild-type with strong rectification and time-dependent activation at pH 7.2. The pH sensitivity of these channels was also identical to wild-type (data not shown). Thus disruption of this putative ion pair by the R230E mutation is unlikely to control the pH-sensitive time-dependent activation of these channels. Control of pH Sensitivity by an Intersubunit Interaction— Fig. 5B shows that Glu-242 in Kir3.1 also makes close contact with Arg-205. The charged carboxyl group of Glu-242 and the amino group of Arg-205 are less than 4 Å apart. In other Kir channels the equivalent residue to Kir3.1(R205) is either an arginine or lysine residue, but in Kir4.1 it is a histidine (His-190) and in Kir4.2 a glutamine (Gln-189) (Fig. 1). We therefore tested the effect of mutating His-190 in Kir4.1. Fig. 6A demonstrates that the Kir4.1(H190R)-Kir5.1 channels exhibit very weak rectification at pH 7.2 and no time-dependent activation. However, as shown in Fig. 6B, at pH 6.8 the rectification increases (Fir pH 7.2 = 1.8 ± 0.20, n = 6; Fir pH 6.8 = 3.6 ± 0.5, n = 6) and the slow time-dependent activation reappears (τ = 1.59 ± 0.20 s, calculated at –120 mV, n = 5). Furthermore, the Kir4.1(H190R)-Kir5.1 channels were significantly less sensitive to inhibition by intracellular acidification (Fig. 7). The pKa for inhibition of Kir4.1(H190R)-Kir5.1 channels using this method was 6.23 ± 0.01, n = 6.Fig. 7pH sensitivity of Kir4.1(H190R)/Kir5.1 channels. Plot of the intracellular pH versus current inhibition for oocytes expressing Kir4.1-Kir5.1 (•) and Kir4.1(H190R)-Kir5.1 (▿) mRNAs. Values were calculated as described in the legend to Fig. 3B and under “Materials and Methods.” Data points are the mean ± S.E. n = 6.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the potential interaction between Arg-230 in Kir5.1 and His-190 in Kir4.1 we also tested the effect of combining mutations at both these positions. Fig. 8, A and B, shows that the Kir4.1(H190R)-Kir5.1(R230E) channels exhibit weak rectification and very little time-dependent activation, and that intracellular acidification induces stronger rectification and time-dependent activation. However, compared with Kir4.1(H190R)-Kir5.1 channels the double mutant exhibits a greater sensitivity to inhibition by H+; pKa Kir4.1(H190R)-Kir5.1(R230E) = 6.83 ± 0.02, n = 5 (Fig. 8C). Thus the Kir5.1(R230E) mutation has the ability to reverse the loss of pH sensitivity caused by the Kir4.1(H190R) mutation. In this study we demonstrate that residues at an interface between the cytoplasmic domains of Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 influence the permeation, gating, and pH sensitivity of heteromeric Kir4.1-Kir5.1 channels. This intersubunit interaction presents a structural mechanism for the functional coupling of these properties and explains how specific heteromeric interactions can contribute to the novel functional properties observed in heteromeric Kir channels. The highly conserved nature of this structural association throughout the Kir family has implications for understanding the general mechanisms of Kir channel gating and for their regulation by intracellular pH. A Structural as well as Functional Interaction—The ability of K+ channels to heteromultimerize contributes to the rich functional diversity produced by this gene family. However, the interactions that control Kir channel assembly are still poorly understood and no single domain has been shown to regulate channel assembly. Nevertheless, we have recently been able to define a small domain within the proximal C terminus of Kir4.1 that contributes to the highly selective heteromeric interaction between Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 (13Konstas A. Korbmacher C. Tucker S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C910-C917Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). It was therefore of extreme interest to notice that this domain in Kir4.1 contains His-190 and thus contributes to the novel functional properties of Kir4.1/Kir5.1 as well as influencing subunit assembly. However, His-190 in Kir4.1 cannot directly control the heteromeric assembly between Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 because Kir4.2 also shows similar heteromeric specificity and contains a glutamate at this position. Chimeric analysis of this region suggests that other residues within this domain are also required (13Konstas A. Korbmacher C. Tucker S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: C910-C917Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the overall domain containing His-190 clearly contributes to the specificity of heteromeric assembly and suggests that this interface between Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 serves a dual purpose as both a structural and functional interaction. It is also important to note that the “extended arm” structure that contains residue Arg-230 in Kir5.1 (see Fig. 5A) is very highly conserved and that a similar interaction must occur in all other Kir channels that are identical to that pictured in Fig. 5B. It is therefore likely that this conserved interface between Kir subunits has been adapted by Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 to assist with structural specificity during assembly as well as contributing to its unique functional properties. Interaction of the Cytoplasmic Domains in Heteromeric Kir Channels—If heteromeric Kir channels adopt a 2 + 2 stoichiometry with subunits opposite each other (14Pessia M. Tucker S.J. Lee K. Bond C.T. Adelman J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2980-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), then for channels where the two subunits are almost identical (e.g. Kir2.1/Kir2.4 (19Schram G. Melnyk P. Pourrier M. Wang Z. Nattel S. J. Physiol. 2002; 544: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and Kir6.1/Kir6.2 (20Babenko A.P. Gonzales G.C. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 275: 31563-31566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (26) Google Scholar)) the heteromeric channel is unlikely to be markedly different. Whereas if the two subunits are dissimilar (e.g. Kir4.1/Kir5.1) then the heteromeric channels are more likely to be asymmetric, have novel interactions, and thus novel properties. The three-dimensional crystal structure of the Kir3.1 intracellular domains (18Nishida M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 2002; 111: 957-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and more recently the prokaryotic KirBac1.1 structure (21Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar) demonstrate that these intracellular domains intimately associate with each other to generate an “extended pore” structure. Gating of Kir channels by intracellular ligands such as ATP, G-proteins, and pH have all been shown to involve allosteric movement of these domains (22Lippiat J.D. Albinson S.L. Ashcroft F.M. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S377-S380Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Riven I. Kalmanzon E. Segev L. Reuveny E.

They are therefore not static but dynamic structures and consequently the contacts between must also be dynamic. We propose that the intersubunit interface we have identified affects channel activity by influencing the interaction between Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 and that such interactions are likely to underlie the regulation of Kir channels by intracellular ligands. Coupling of Inward Rectification and Time-dependent Activation—There is a functional interdependence between the pore and gating mechanism of many potassium channels. Almost by definition, any gating mechanism will act to obstruct the pore and will therefore interact mechanically with the permeation pathway, also mutations within the pore of several K+ channels have been shown to influence gating (15Kofuji P. Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Physiol. 1996; 490: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 27Heginbotham L. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1992; 258: 1152-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 28Heginbotham L. Lu Z. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Rectification of Kir channels involves voltage-dependent block by intracellular Mg2+ and polyamines (29Nichols C.G. Lopatin A. Curr. Top. Membr. 1999; 46: 159-176Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that the time-dependent component of activation seen in Kir3.0 heteromeric channels is due to the slow unblock of the channel by intracellular polyamines that are bound within this cytoplasmic pore (30Lancaster M. Dibb K. Quinn C. Leach R. Lee J. Findlay J. Boyett M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 275: 35831-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that polyamines could provide a mechanistic link between the time-dependent activation (or slow unblock) and inward rectification seen in Kir4.1-Kir5.1 channels. However, the Kir4.1-Kir5.1(R230K) mutant exhibits weaker rectification but similar time-dependent activation compared with wild-type channels and if polyamines provide the direct link between these two processes then they would not be so easily uncoupled as they are by this mutation. Also, the R230K mutation demonstrates that it is not simply a reversal of electrostatic charge that disrupts the interaction at this interface. Instead, we propose that the mutations we have identified disturb the dynamic association between adjacent C termini and that this either stabilizes or destabilizes the physical association between the intracellular domains. This will result in allosteric changes in the domains themselves and because they define the inner pore of the channel, and their movement regulates gating, then this provides a mechanism by which intersubunit interactions can control both rectification and gating. The recent KirBac1.1 structure also presents a structural model for how such allosteric rearrangements of the C termini may be translated into channel gating (21Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Antcliff J.F. Rahman T. Lowe E.D. Zimmer J. Cuthbertson J. Ashcroft F.M. Ezaki T. Doyle D.A. Science. 2003; 300: 1922-1926Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). It still remains possible that polyamines may play a role but further experiments will be required to assess their contribution. pH-sensitive Inward Rectification and Time-dependent Activation— Fig. 3 demonstrates that the inward rectification and time-dependent activation properties of this channel are pH-sensitive. We believe that the pH effect on rectification is most prominent in the Kir4.1-Kir5.1(R230E) mutant because these channels exhibit weaker rectification to start with. By contrast, wild-type channels exhibit strong inward rectification at pH 7.2, therefore it is more difficult to measure any potential increase in rectification induced by acidification. However, pH-dependent effects on the time-dependent activation of wild-type Kir4.1-Kir5.1 channels can still be observed. But what of the mechanism? Intracellular acidification increases rectification and changes the rate of time-dependent activation, making it more pronounced. The functional effect of the Kir5.1(R230E) mutation is not to abolish this time-dependent activation but to somehow weaken the coupling between this effect and intracellular pH, i.e. it appears to shift the pH sensitivity of this process. It is unlikely that direct titration of polyamines accounts for this because their pKa is generally > 8. We believe the most likely explanation is that this interaction physically couples the pH-sensing mechanism (primarily on the Kir4.1 subunit) with the stronger rectification and time-dependent activation properties (conferred by the Kir5.1 subunit). Direct titration of histidine 190 in Kir4.1 is also unlikely to be responsible for the pH sensitivity of these properties because the rectification and time-dependent activation of the Kir4.1(H190R) mutant reappear upon intracellular acidification, thus other titratable residues must be responsible. Also, Kir4.2 possesses a glutamine at this position and heteromeric Kir4.2/Kir5.1 channels exhibit similar time-dependent activation and rectification. The interactions at this interface are therefore complex and a simple direct interaction between Kir5.1(Arg-230) and Kir4.1(His-190) cannot explain all these properties. It is therefore more likely that the Kir5.1(R230E) and Kir4.1(H190R) mutations somehow disturb the overall intersubunit interaction between Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 at this interface, and that this weakens the “coupling” between these biophysical properties and changes in intracellular pH. The Kir4.1(E310R) mutation does not have the same effect as the Kir5.1(R230E) mutation yet in the Kir3.1 structure the equivalent residues seem to be very close. The highly conserved nature of this “ion pair,” which is reversed in Kir4.1/Kir5.1, suggests that it must be of some importance, yet if it were absolutely essential for structural assembly or gating then in the Kir4.1 homomeric channel these residues would both be negatively charged and so would not be able to form an electrostatic ion pair. It was therefore intriguing to note that in a very recent study by Shyng and colleagues (31Lin Y.-W. Jia T. Weinsoft A.M. Shyng S.-L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) this ion pair appears to be responsible for stabilizing the activity of homomeric Kir6.2. However, the equivalent Kir5.1(R230)-Kir4.1-(E310) interaction does not appear to contribute to the specific properties we have investigated. Further studies will therefore be required to understand the contribution of this ion pair to heteromeric Kir4.1/Kir5.1 channel function. Nevertheless, the fact that this same interface regulates the activity of Kir6.2 (31Lin Y.-W. Jia T. Weinsoft A.M. Shyng S.-L. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 122: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) highlights the functional importance of this intersubunit interaction and suggests that similar interactions may contribute to the gating of other Kir channels. Intersubunit Interactions Influence Inhibition by Intracellular H + —One of the most surprising findings was that the Kir4.1(H190R)-Kir5.1 mutation also influences the ability of the channel to sense intracellular H+. This observation suggests that the current model for the pH sensor in these channels may be more complex than originally proposed (11Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Sculte U. Brandle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 12Schulte U. Hahn H. Konrad M. Jeck N. Derst C. Wild K. Weidemann S. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Ludwig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15298-15303Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Also, the structure of Kir3.1 and KirBac1.1 reveal that both of the highly conserved arginines thought to produce anomalous titration of the pH sensor lysine are at least 40 Å from the relevant part of TM1, shedding doubt on the precise role of the “RKR triad” in anomalous titration (12Schulte U. Hahn H. Konrad M. Jeck N. Derst C. Wild K. Weidemann S. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. Ludwig J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15298-15303Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It is possible that H+ inhibition is influenced by particular gating modes, inhibition occurring preferentially via an open or closed conformation of the channel, and that changes in channel gating produced by particular residues or mutations influence pH sensitivity indirectly. Such indirect effects of mutations on ligand regulation are observed in Kir6.2 where changes in channel gating influence regulation by ATP and H+, and also the activation of Kir3.2 by G-proteins (32Trapp S.

It is therefore possible that dynamic interactions between the intracellular domains of Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 influence channel gating and thereby regulation by H+. This may also provide a mechanism to account for the fact that physical association with Kir5.1 “enhances” the intrinsic pH sensitivity of Kir4.1, shifting the pKa into the physiological range. The ability of the Kir4.1(H190R) mutation to affect pH sensitivity, and the ability of the Kir5.1(R230E) mutation to compensate this effect further supports a role for this interface in the control of pH sensitivity. The contribution of this interaction to the pH sensitivity of heteromeric Kir4.2/Kir5.1 channel activity is less significant because Kir4.2 exhibits a much greater pH sensitivity than Kir4.1 (pKa 7.2 versus 6.0) and this is not affected by heteromultimerization with Kir5.1 (10Pessia M. Imbrici P. D'Adamo M.C. Salvatore L. Tucker S.J. J. Physiol. 2001; 532: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, Kir4.2 exhibits highly selective heteromultimerization with Kir5.1 and this interface is likely to contribute to this selectivity. Conclusions—These studies have allowed us to define an interaction between the cytoplasmic domains of Kir4.1 and Kir5.1, which influences inward rectification, gating, and regulation by intracellular pH. Functional coupling of these properties also appears to occur through this interaction. Finally, the fact that this interface is highly conserved and can contribute to the activity of other Kir channels suggests that it may form part of a common gating mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2111714443,"The outer dynein arm-docking complex (ODA-DC) targets the outer dynein arm to its correct binding site on the flagellar axoneme. The Chlamydomonas ODA-DC contains three proteins; loss of any one prevents normal assembly of the outer arm, leading to a slow, jerky swimming phenotype. We showed previously that the smallest ODA-DC subunit, DC3, has four EF-hands (Casey, D. M., Inaba, K., Pazour, G. J., Takada, S., Wakabayashi, K., Wilkerson, C. G., Kamiya, R., and Witman, G. B. (2003) Mol. Biol. Cell 14, 3650-3663). Two of the EF-hands fit the consensus pattern for calcium binding, and one of these contains two cysteine residues within its binding loop. To determine whether the predicted EF-hands are functional, we purified bacterially expressed wild-type DC3 and analyzed its calcium-binding potential in the presence and absence of dithiothreitol and Mg2+. The protein bound one calcium ion with an affinity (K d) of ∼1 × 10-5m. Calcium binding was observed only in the presence of dithiothreitol and thus is redox-sensitive. DC3 also bound Mg2+ at physiological concentrations but with a much lower affinity. Changing the essential glutamate to glutamine in both EF-hands eliminated the calcium binding activity of the bacterially expressed protein. To investigate the role of the EF-hands in vivo, we transformed the modified DC3 gene into a Chlamydomonas insertional mutant lacking DC3. The transformed strain swam normally, assembled a normal number of outer arms, and had a normal photoshock response, indicating that the Glu to Gln mutations did not affect ODA-DC assembly, outer arm assembly, or Ca2+-mediated outer arm activity. Thus, DC3 is a true calcium-binding protein, but the function of this activity remains unknown.

Thus, DC3 is a true calcium-binding protein, but the function of this activity remains unknown. Intracellular calcium plays an important role in the control of eukaryotic cilia and flagella. For example, calcium signals control the beat frequency of mammalian airway cilia (1Evans J.H. Sanderson M.J. Cell Calcium. 1999; 26: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the hyperactivation of mammalian sperm flagella (2Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Vol. 1. Raven Press, Ltd., New, York1988: 135-185Google Scholar), the reversal of ciliary beating in ciliates (3Naitoh Y. Kaneko H. Science. 1972; 176: 523-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and phototaxis and photoshock in the biflagellate alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (for review see Ref. 4Witman G.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 403-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Despite the important role that calcium plays in these processes, little is known about the biochemical pathways or the calcium-binding proteins involved. A few Ca2+-binding proteins, e.g. calmodulin (5Gitelman S.E. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 87: 764-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 6Jamieson Jr., G.A. Vanaman T.C. Blum J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6471-6475Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), centrin/caltractin (7Piperno G. Ramanis Z. Smith E.F. Sale W.S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and dynein light chain 4 (see Ref. 8King S.M. Patel-King R.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3757-3764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and see below), have been identified within the axoneme, but their precise functions in Ca2+-mediated flagellar behavior have not yet been clearly defined. Given the complexity of the axoneme and the likely need to modulate the activity of multiple axonemal structures to achieve a coordinated change in waveform in response to changes in Ca2+ concentration, it is probable that the axoneme contains additional Ca2+-binding proteins. Identification and characterization of these proteins will be essential for understanding the molecular basis for the Ca2+ control of ciliary and flagellar waveform. Chlamydomonas normally swims forward by means of a “breaststroke”-like beat pattern in which the flagella propagate asymmetrical bends. The photoshock response, which is induced by a strong step-up light stimulus and mediated by an increase in intraflagellar Ca2+ from ≤10-6 to 10-5-10-4m, consists of an abrupt cessation of forward swimming, followed by a brief period of backward swimming during which the flagella propagate symmetrical bends, and finally a return to the normal asymmetrical bending pattern and forward swimming (4Witman G.B. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 403-408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The generation of symmetrical bends during photoshock requires the outer dynein arms (9Mitchell D.R. Rosenbaum J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1228-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 10Kamiya R. Okamoto M. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 74: 181-191PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the outer arms are regulated by Ca2+. One outer dynein arm light chain, LC4, 1The abbreviations used are: LC4, the 18-kDa calcium-binding outer dynein arm light chain; ODA-DC, outer dynein arm-docking complex; ARG7, the argininosuccinate lyase gene of Chlamydomonas; CaM, calmodulin; CTER, a congruent group of EF-hand proteins including calmodulin, troponin C, and the essential and regulatory light chains of myosin; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TnC, troponin C; TnI, troponin I.1The abbreviations used are: LC4, the 18-kDa calcium-binding outer dynein arm light chain; ODA-DC, outer dynein arm-docking complex; ARG7, the argininosuccinate lyase gene of Chlamydomonas; CaM, calmodulin; CTER, a congruent group of EF-hand proteins including calmodulin, troponin C, and the essential and regulatory light chains of myosin; DTT, dithiothreitol; GST, glutathione S-transferase; TnC, troponin C; TnI, troponin I. is a Ca2+-binding protein, and it has been hypothesized that this subunit may have a role in mediating outer arm function during photoshock (8King S.M. Patel-King R.S. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3757-3764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, there currently is no experimental evidence in support of such a role for LC4. In the axoneme, the outer arms are in direct contact with the outer dynein arm-docking complex (ODA-DC) (11Takada S. Wilkerson C.G. Wakabayashi K. Kamiya R. Witman G.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1015-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which targets the outer arm to its correct binding site on the doublet microtubule (12Takada S. Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The ODA-DC contains three subunits, termed DC1, DC2, and DC3, with masses of 83, 62, and 21 kDa, respectively. DC1 and DC2 are predicted to be long coiled-coil proteins that have a structural role in assembling the ODA-DC, and loss of either of these results in complete loss of the outer arms and a slow, jerky swimming phenotype (11Takada S. Wilkerson C.G. Wakabayashi K. Kamiya R. Witman G.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1015-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 13Koutoulis A. Pazour G.J. Wilkerson C.G. Inaba K. Sheng H. Takada S. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Loss of DC3 causes partial loss of the outer arms and a phenotype intermediate between those of DC1 or DC2 mutants and wild type (14Casey D.M. Inaba K. Pazour G.J. Takada S. Wakabayashi K. Wilkerson C.G. Kamiya R. Witman G.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3650-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, sequence analysis of DC3 indicates that it may be a Ca2+-binding protein (see Ref. 14Casey D.M. Inaba K. Pazour G.J. Takada S. Wakabayashi K. Wilkerson C.G. Kamiya R. Witman G.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3650-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar and see below). Moreover, mutants lacking DC3 are unable to swim backwards during photoshock, despite having a partial complement of outer arms (14Casey D.M. Inaba K. Pazour G.J. Takada S. Wakabayashi K. Wilkerson C.G. Kamiya R. Witman G.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3650-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This raises the question of whether DC3 is a Ca2+-binding protein and, if so, if it is involved in this Ca2+-mediated flagellar response. Many calcium-binding proteins, including calmodulin (CaM), troponin C (TnC), and centrin, share a common calcium-binding motif called an EF-hand. EF-hand motifs consist of two α-helices (helix E and helix F, respectively) separated by a 12-residue loop. The loop of the helix-loop-helix motif forms the calcium-binding pocket. Loop residues 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 12 coordinate the calcium ion; their positions within the loop are designated X, Y, Z, -Y, -X, and -Z, respectively (Fig. 1). The last coordinating residue (-Z) is highly conserved and provides two oxygens for liganding calcium. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence and secondary structure of DC3 revealed four EF-hand motifs (EF1 to EF4, starting at the N terminus; Fig. 2), two of which (EF2 and EF4) fit the consensus pattern for calcium binding: DX(DNS){ILVFYW}(DENSTG)(DNQGHRK){GP}(LIVMC)(DENQSTAGC)X(2Yanagimachi R. Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. Vol. 1. Raven Press, Ltd., New, York1988: 135-185Google Scholar)(DE)(LIVMFYW), where X indicates any amino acid, parentheses indicate either/or, and braces indicate any amino acid except those shown (PROSITE accession number PS00018). DC3 is a novel member of the CTER (calmodulin, troponin C, essential and regulatory light chains of myosin) group of EF-hand proteins (14Casey D.M. Inaba K. Pazour G.J. Takada S. Wakabayashi K. Wilkerson C.G. Kamiya R. Witman G.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3650-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). DC3 is unique among CTER proteins in that one of its EF-hands contains two cysteines, which may be capable of forming a disulfide bond at the potential Ca2+-binding site. To determine the in vitro properties of the EF-hands of DC3, we expressed DC3 in bacteria (fused to the C terminus of GST), and we assayed its Ca2+/Mg2+ binding ability in the presence and absence of a dithiol reductant using an in vitro binding assay. The results indicate that DC3 binds one Ca2+ with a K d of ∼1 × 10-5m and binds Mg2+ with a much lower affinity; this Ca2+ binding activity is redox-sensitive. To determine the in vivo function of the EF-hands of DC3, we used site-directed mutagenesis to inactivate them and then transformed the mutated gene into a DC3-null strain that assembles only some of the outer dynein arms, swims slowly, and does not generate symmetrical bends during photoshock. We then assayed the swimming speed, number of outer arms, and ability to undergo photoshock of the transformant and compared it to a DC3-null strain transformed with the wild-type DC3 gene. Both the mutant and wild-type genes restored all parameters tested to wild-type levels. Strains—C. reinhardtii strains used in this study include the following: g1 (nit1, mt+) (15Pazour G.J. Sineshchekov O.A. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar); H8-(arg7, mt-) (obtained from Dr. P. Lefebvre, University of Minnesota); V06 (oda14-1::NIT1, nit1, mt+) (13Koutoulis A. Pazour G.J. Wilkerson C.G. Inaba K. Sheng H. Takada S. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1069-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), generated by insertional mutagenesis of g1; 026.2 (oda14-1::NIT1, arg7, mt+; offspring of V06 × H8- cross); and transformants d58, d65, d76, e20, e62, and e84 obtained by transforming strain 026.2 with a wild-type (transformants d58, d65, and d76) or a modified (transformants e20, e62, and e84) ODA14 genomic clone and pARG7.8 (16Debuchy R. Purton S. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2803-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Growth Media—The following media were used: M medium I (17Sager R. Granick S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1953; 56: 831-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) modified to contain 0.0022 m KH2PO4 and 0.00171 m K2HPO4 and supplemented with 0.0075 m sodium acetate (referred to as R medium in this study); R + Arg (R medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml arginine); and TAP (18Gorman D.S. Levine R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1665-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis—Starting with the plasmid clone pDC3S-2 (14Casey D.M. Inaba K. Pazour G.J. Takada S. Wakabayashi K. Wilkerson C.G. Kamiya R. Witman G.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3650-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which contains the intronless wild-type DC3 (ODA14) gene, two sequential rounds of mutagenesis (Chameleon™ Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were used to create point mutations in the DC3 gene. One primer (E74Q, 5′-CTGCATCAGCCTTCTACAATTCCAGACGCTATAC-3′) was designed to inactivate the first consensus EF-hand by changing the highly conserved glutamate residue in position 12 of the calcium-binding loop to a glutamine. After sequencing (DNA Sequencing Facility, Iowa State University, Ames) to confirm that the first consensus EF-hand had been mutated, a second primer (E152Q, 5′-CCTCACGCTCACGCAGTTCCTGCACTGCTTGC-3′) was used to make a similar Glu to Gln mutation in the second consensus EF-hand. Sequencing confirmed the presence of the second mutation. The construct was named pDC3Qx2-9. Bacterial Expression of Wild-type and Mutant DC3—The DC3 coding region of either pDC3S-2 or pDC3Qx2-9 was amplified by the PCR using the primers DCFPF-1 (5′-CGCGGATCCATGGCGAGTGCC-3′) and DCFPR-1 (5′-CCGGATCCTCACTTGCGCTTCTG-3′). Amplification with these primers resulted in a 5′ BamHI site directly upstream of the DC3 start codon and a 3′ BamHI site directly downstream of the stop codon. PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), digested with BamHI, and ligated into BamHI-digested and alkaline phosphatase-treated pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). This construct was designed to express DC3 fused to the C terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST). The wild-type fusion protein is termed “GST-DC3” and the EF-hand mutant fusion protein is termed “GST-DC3-(E74Q, E152Q).” The constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (Amersham Biosciences), and fusion protein expression was induced with either 0.1 mm (GST-DC3-(E74Q, E152Q)) or 0.3 mm (GST-DC3) isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at room temperature. A lower concentration of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was used to induce the mutant protein to aid in its solubility (according to The Recombinant Protein Handbook from Amersham Biosciences). After induction, the recombinant protein was released from the bacterial cells using a French® press (Thermo Spectronic, Rochester, NY). The bacterial lysate was centrifuged, and the soluble fraction was applied to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C; the affinity-purified fusion protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm reduced glutathione, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT). The size and purity of the recombinant protein was determined by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was determined with the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Prior to determination of protein concentration, the fusion protein was dialyzed extensively at 4 °C against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl using a Slide-A-Lyzer® Dialysis Cassette (Pierce) with a molecular mass cut-off of 10,000 Da to remove reduced glutathione and DTT present in the column elution buffer (DTT interferes with the bicinchoninic acid assay). In some instances, the GST moiety was removed from the fusion protein by adding DTT to 1 mm and cleaving with PreScission™ Protease (Amersham Biosciences) followed by glutathione-Sepharose 4B column chromatography. The protease is GST-tagged and was therefore retained by the column; DC3 was collected in the flow through. Before determining the protein concentration of DC3 alone, it was dialyzed extensively against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl using a Slide-A-Lyzer® Dialysis Cassette with a molecular mass cut-off of 3,500 Da to remove DTT present in the cleavage buffer. Unless indicated otherwise, DTT was added to 1 mm before using the protein in Ca2+ binding assays. Electroporation Of Recombinant DC3 into Chlamydomonas Cells—Introduction of recombinant DC3 into DC3-null cells was done essentially as described by Hayashi et al. (19Hayashi M. Yanagisawa H. Hirono M. Kamiya R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2002; 53: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell walls were removed from the DC3 deletion strain, V06, using Chlamydomonas autolysin (20Harris E.H. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook. Academic Press, New York1989: 1-780Crossref Google Scholar). After cell wall removal, the cells were washed several times in HMDKCaS (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm DTT, 50 mm CH3COOK, 1 mm (CH3COO)2Ca, 60 mm sucrose) and resuspended to 1 × 108 cells/ml in the same buffer. The cell suspension and a 2 μm DC3 solution made in HMDKCaS were mixed in a 1:1 volume ratio. A 125-μl aliquot of the mixture was transferred to an electroporation cuvette (model 620, BTX, San Diego) and incubated at 15 °C for a total of 15 min after cell washing. An electric pulse of 350 V was then applied to the mixture using an ECM600 electroporation apparatus (BTX) with a resistance of 24 ohms and a conductance of 600 microfarads. The overall time constant used for each sample was around 12 ms. After electroporation, the cuvette was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with shaking every 5 min. The cells were then washed several times in TAP medium supplemented with 60 mm sucrose (TAP + S), resuspended in 125 μl TAP + S, and left at room temperature for 2-3 h to allow the cells to recover. Ca2+ Binding Assay—Ca2+ binding assays were performed at room temperature by the ultrafiltration method of Ladant (21Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3179-3185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, 1 ml of a 10-20 μm protein solution (either GST-DC3, GST-DC3-(E74Q, E152Q), or DC3 alone) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, with or without 1 mm DTT was placed in the upper chamber of a Centricon Centrifugal Filter Device with a nominal molecular mass cut-off of 10,000 Da (YM-10; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). To reduce nonspecific protein binding, the filter unit was pre-treated with 5% Tween 20 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty μl of a 500 μm CaCl2 solution containing ∼2 μCi of 45Ca2+ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to the protein solution and mixed, and 20 μl was removed for scintillation counting of total radioactivity (i.e. bound + unbound 45Ca2+). Next, the filter assembly was centrifuged (IEC model HN-SII, 2500 rpm for ∼1 min) until 35-40 μl had filtered through. The filtrate was collected and added back to the top compartment, mixed, and centrifuged as before. Twenty μl of the second filtrate was taken for scintillation counting of unbound 45Ca2+. Samples were always collected from the second filtrate to ensure an accurate measure of the unbound Ca2+ at each unique total Ca2+ concentration (as opposed to a measure of the unbound Ca2+ remaining in the filter from the previous data point). Thereafter, 40 μl of 250 μm non-radioactive CaCl2 was added to the top compartment, and the above procedure was repeated until the desired range of calcium concentrations was covered. The ratio of radioactivity in the filtrate to radioactivity in the top compartment (i.e. unbound calcium/total calcium) was used to deduce the amount of calcium bound per molecule of protein at each total Ca2+ concentration. The Ca2+ affinity (reported as a dissociation constant, K d) was derived from a Scatchard plot of [Ca2+]bound/[Ca2+]free versus [Ca2+]bound. To determine whether the observed metal binding was Ca2+-specific, MgCl2 (1 or 20 mm) was included in some assays. Tryptophan Fluorescence Spectra—The effect of Ca2+ and Mg2+ on the tryptophan fluorescence of GST-DC3 was analyzed using a SPEX FluoroLog-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon, Inc., Edison, NJ). Trp fluorescence spectra were recorded before and after the addition of either 20 mm Mg2+ or 1 mm Ca2+ to 1 μm GST-DC3 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT. The spectra were recorded at 22 °C with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. Transformation of Chlamydomonas—By using the silicon carbide fiber method of Dunahay (22Dunahay T.G. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 452-454PubMed Google Scholar), we co-transformed strain 026.2, an arg7 derivative of oda14-1, with the pARG7.8 plasmid containing the cloned argininosuccinate lyase (ARG7) gene (16Debuchy R. Purton S. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2803-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), and plasmid clones containing the wild-type or modified ODA14 gene. ARG7 transformants were selected on solid R medium. Individual transformants were picked into liquid R medium and screened by light microscopy for restored wild-type forward motility. Electron Microscopy—Flagellar axonemes were isolated from cells grown in TAP medium (18Gorman D.S. Levine R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 1665-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1246) Google Scholar) by using the method of Witman (23Witman G.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 280-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and prepared for electron microscopy as described by Kamiya (24Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2253-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Swimming Velocity and Flagellar Beat Frequency Measurements—Swimming velocity was measured as described by Kamiya (24Kamiya R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2253-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Briefly, motile cells were imaged using dark-field microscopy, and their swimming behavior was recorded with a CCD camera and VCR. Images from the videotape were “captured” using motion-capture software (Motion Capture, InterQuest, Osaka, Japan) at a rate of 10 frames/s. The video clips were then played on a computer monitor, and representative cells to be tracked were chosen by the operator, and their positions as a function of time were determined by cell-tracking software (Image Tracker PTV, InterQuest). The swimming velocity of ∼30 cells was used to calculate the average swimming velocity for each strain. For photokinesis experiments, cells were dark-adapted for 2 h and then observed with or without 5 min of pre-illumination with white fluorescent light. Cells without pre-illumination were imaged using red light (630-nm cut-off filter), and those with pre-illumination were imaged using white light. Again, the average swimming velocity for each strain was determined from measurements of ∼30 cells. The average flagellar beat frequency of a population of forward swimming cells was determined by fast Fourier transform analysis, exactly as described by Kamiya (25Kamiya R. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 2000; 22: 383-387Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To determine the average flagellar beat frequency change induced by photoshock, cells were imaged using a ×40 objective (instead of the usual ×10 objective) and at low cell density to permit fast Fourier transform analysis of individual cells. Forward swimming cells were initially viewed and analyzed using red light; photoshock was then induced by removal of the red filter from the observation beam, and the beat frequency during the resulting transient backward swimming was determined. About 20 cells were used to calculate the average flagellar beat frequency before and during photoshock for each strain. Photoshock Assays—Cells that had been dark-adapted for 3 h were placed in a custom phototaxis chamber (26Moss A.G. Pazour G.J. Witman G.B. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 47: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) that was mounted on the stage of a Zeiss universal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornton, NJ). Randomly swimming cells were initially viewed with dim red illumination to prevent light-induced behaviors. Photoshock was assayed by monitoring the behavior of a population of cells in response to an intense flash of light (a Vivitar 283 camera flash). The response of the cells was recorded on videotape by capturing images with a CCD camera mounted on the microscope. Cells were scored as having a normal photoshock response if, after a flash of intense light, they stopped forward swimming, briefly swam backwards, and then resumed forward swimming. Bacterially Expressed DC3 Is Biologically Functional—DC3 was expressed in E. coli as a C-terminal fusion with GST. A protein of the appropriate mass (∼47 kDa) was produced and purified; SDS-PAGE analysis of the purified protein is shown in Fig. 3A. To determine whether bacterially expressed DC3 was biologically functional, the GST tag was removed by digesting the fusion protein with PreScission™ protease (Amersham Biosciences), and the free DC3 was purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences) (Fig. 3B). The purified DC3 was then electroporated into the DC3-null strain, V06. Because they lack DC3, V06 cells assemble a reduced number of outer arms and consequently have a lower flagellar beat frequency and slower swimming speed than wild-type cells (14Casey D.M. Inaba K. Pazour G.J. Takada S. Wakabayashi K. Wilkerson C.G. Kamiya R. Witman G.B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3650-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). During electroporation, most cells lose their flagella; this deflagellation is essential for efficient protein delivery (19Hayashi M. Yanagisawa H. Hirono M. Kamiya R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2002; 53: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Flagellar regeneration after electroporation takes about 3 h (19Hayashi M. Yanagisawa H. Hirono M. Kamiya R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2002; 53: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, the cells were viewed with dark-field microscopy 3 h after electroporation, and their movement was recorded using a microscope-mounted CCD camera and a VCR. By using motion-capture/cell-tracking software, we measured the average swimming velocity of wild-type cells, V06 cells, and V06 cells electroporated in the presence of 1 μm DC3. Wild-type cells swam with an average speed of 228 μm/s. V06 cells swam with an average speed of 130 μm/s. The average swimming velocity of V06 cells electroporated in the presence of 1 μm DC3 was 194 μm/s. These results indicate that recombinant DC3 was able to restore near wild-type swimming speed to the null mutant. As an additional test of rescue, we measured the average beat frequency of wild-type cells, V06 cells, and V06 cells electroporated in the presence of 1 μm DC3. Wild-type cells had an average beat frequency of 61 Hz, whereas V06 had an average beat frequency of 37 Hz. V06 electroporated in the presence of 1 μm DC3 had an average beat frequency of 59 Hz. Based on these data, we conclude that recombinant DC3 is biologically functional and supports the assembly of outer arms onto outer doublet microtubules. DC3 Is a Ca2+-binding Protein—DC3 has two consensus EF-hands (Fig. 2), indicating that it may bind Ca2+. By using the ultrafiltration method of Ladant (21Ladant D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3179-3185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we determined that GST-DC3 indeed bound ∼1 mol of calcium/mol of protein in the presence of DTT (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained with DC3 after removal of the GST tag, demonstrating that calcium binding is an intrinsic property of DC3 rather than a nonspecific effect due to the GST moiety (data not shown). Scatchard analysis of the GST-DC3 Ca2+-binding data indicated that the calcium affinity of DC3 (expressed as a dissociation constant, K d) is 1.2 × 10-5m (Fig. 4B); similar results were obtained with DC3 alone (K d = 1.3 × 10-5m). This is in the range expected to be physiologically relevant for photoshock (see Introduction). The Ca2+ Binding Activity of DC3 Is Redox-sensitive—DC3 contains four cysteine residues (underlined in Fig. 2), two of which (Cys-66 and Cys-69) are within the first consensus calcium-binding loop. Cys-69 is one of the six loop residues (position -Y) that coordinates the Ca2+ ion (see In"

Here we show that VEGF-D mRNA is down-modulated either by β-catenin mobilization from the cell membrane, by activation of the Wnt signaling pathway, or by transfection with the β-catenin stable mutant. Down-modulation of β-catenin by means of RNA interference showed an increase of VEGF-D mRNA steady state in fibroblasts. The β-catenin-dependent decrease of VEGF-D mRNA is indirect and mainly due to reduced VEGF-D mRNA stability, as demonstrated by experiments of mRNA decay in the presence of transcription or translation inhibitors. By transient transfection of chimeric constructs carrying fusion of VEGF-D sequences under the control of the cytomegalovirus early promoter, we demonstrated that β-catenin negative regulation is on the VEGF-D mRNA 3′-untranslated region. We mapped the VEGF-D mRNA-destabilizing element to a sequence, conserved between mouse and human VEGF-D, which contains an AU-rich element of group I. These results unveiled a new regulatory pathway for VEGF-D, which explains, at least in part, VEGF-D regulation in tumor progression.

During development and in the vascularization of tumors, the newly forming tissues produce inductive signaling that leads to the formation of capillaries throughout.

VEGF-A is a potent angiogenic factor able to induce vessel sprouting. It recognizes the receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 on endothelial cells. It is strongly expressed in tumors as it is induced by hypoxia with induced transcription and increasing mRNA stability (17Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol.

This latter is a tyrosine kinase receptor specifically found in adult lymphatic endothelium. In cell culture, VEGF-C is induced by serum, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and several factors including interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α (27Enholm B. Paavonen K. Ristimäki A. Kumar V.

In contrast, VEGF-D is highly expressed in fibroblasts grown under low serum conditions and is induced by direct cell-cell contact mediated by the surface molecule cadherin-11 (14Orlandini M.

VEGF-D was brought to attention with respect to tumor development, as in mice models tumors expressing this factor showed development of intra-tumor lymphatic vessels and dissemination of tumor cells in lymph nodes (2Stacker S.A.

Oliviero, unpublished results. reported that VEGF-D was underexpressed in tumors when compared with normal tissues. To understand VEGF-D regulation by cell-cell contact, we analyzed VEGF-D mRNA levels by altering cytoplasmic β-catenin expression in fibroblasts. β-Catenin is present in the cell in two fractions, a membrane-associated fraction linked to cadherins with a structural function, and an unstable cytoplasmic fraction that acts as a transcriptional regulator (38Henderson B.R. Fagotto F. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 834-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 39Bienz M. Clevers H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that cytoplasmic β-catenin down-modulates VEGF-D inducing the degradation of VEGF-D mRNA. This regulation requires new protein synthesis suggesting an indirect regulation. These results might explain VEGF-D regulation in tumors. Cloning and Plasmid Constructs—To obtain the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the CMV early promoter (FG470), a 878-bp BglII blunt-ended/HindIII fragment that contains the CMV early promoter was cut from the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) and subcloned into the SacI blunt-ended/HindIII sites of the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega).

Cell Culture and Transfections—Mouse 3T3-type fibroblasts, murine BALB/c 3T3, and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Stable clones expressing murine Wnt-1 were obtained from BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts transfected with the Wnt-1 expression vector PLNC-W1HA by standard CaPO4 precipitation procedures (29Orlandini M.

Selection was performed by culturing for 2 weeks in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Transient transfection experiments were performed by using PolyFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to instructions from the manufacturer. Degradation of the mRNAs was studied in mouse 3T3-type fibroblasts. The cells were grown in complete medium until they reached confluence, and then actinomycin D (5 μg/ml; Sigma) as an inhibitor of transcription or cycloheximide (10 μg/ml; Sigma) as an inhibitor of protein synthesis, with or without EGTA (2.2 mm), was added to the cell cultures for 2, 4, and 6 h. Northern Blot Analysis—Analysis of RNA was performed as described previously (14Orlandini M. Marconcini L. Ferruzzi R. Oliviero S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μg of total RNA were size-fractionated in a denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide to verify that each lane contained similar amounts of undegraded rRNA. RNA was transferred onto nylon membranes and cross-linked by UV irradiation. Filters were hybridized with 32P-labeled probes, washed, and analyzed by using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) was used as a control for RNA loading. Immunoblotting—Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested in TEN (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl), pelleted, and lysed in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 2 mm EDTA) containing Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics). The protein concentrations were determined by using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Equal loading was confirmed by staining in Ponceau S solution (Sigma). Filters were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 3% dry milk and 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by 2 h at room temperature with the primary antibodies in the same buffer. The following primary antibodies were used at the indicated concentrations: mouse monoclonal anti-β-catenin (0.2 μg/ml; Transduction Laboratories), rat monoclonal anti-HA (0.1 μg/ml; Roche Diagnostics), mouse monoclonal Abs specific for Myc tag (0.2 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (5 μg/ml; Sigma). The blots were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rat (Chemicon International) for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and finally developed by using the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescent Microscopy—Mouse fibroblasts were grown on glass coverslips and after treatment fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. For permeabilization, cells were incubated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed twice in PBS, blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with primary antibodies diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS (15 μg/ml for β-catenin and 15 μg/ml for anti-HA Abs). After washing, cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of Alexa Fluor-568 goat anti-mouse or Alexa Fluor-488 goat anti-rat secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). To localize actin filaments, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled phalloidin (Sigma) was added along with secondary antibodies at 2 μg/ml. Coverslips were counterstained with 0.1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI; Sigma) and mounted in Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem). Fluorescent images were captured using a Nikon DXM1200 digital camera from a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope. RNA Interference—siRNA duplexes were synthesized by Dharmacon Research Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The sequence of the β-catenin oligonucleotides was 5′-GUAGCUGAUAUUGACGGGCTT-3′ and 5′-GCCCGUCAAUAUCAGCUACTT-3′. Cells were transfected twice, 48 h apart, with the siRNA duplex by using OligofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. As a negative control the single-stranded sense siRNA was used. 96 h after the first transfection cells were analyzed for Northern blot, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescent microscopy. Reporter Assays—In chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assay, mouse 3T3-type and BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts were seeded in 6-well dishes and transiently transfected. Typically a transfection experiment included 0.4 μg of reporter plasmid (TOPCAT or FOPCAT) and 0.1 μg of pRSV-β-galactosidase plasmid for the transfection efficiency control. The expression plasmids were added to the reporter as indicated in the figure legends, and the total amount of transfected plasmids was maintained constant at 2 μg by the addition of empty vectors. CAT activity was determined as described previously (46Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar). Acetylated forms of chloramphenicol were quantified by using the ImageQuant radio analytic system from Amersham Biosciences. In luciferase assay, mouse 3T3-type fibroblasts and HEK 293 cells were seeded in 6-well dishes and transiently transfected with 0.1 μg of the reporter plasmid containing the luciferase gene under the control of the CMV early promoter either fused to the full-length VEGF-D 3′-UTR or to its deletion mutants. As control the polyadenylation signal of SV40 was used. 0.05 μg of pRSV-β-galactosidase plasmid were used for the transfection efficiency control, and the expression plasmids were co-transfected as indicated in Figs. 6 and 7, maintaining constant at 2 μg the total amount of transfected plasmids by the addition of empty vectors. 36–48 h after transfection cells were washed once with PBS and lysed in 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. Luciferase activities in cell lysates were determined using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). Luciferase activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activities and presented as relative luciferase units.Fig. 7β-Catenin-dependent VEGF-D mRNA destabilizing element is conserved between mouse and human. The different constructs used containing the luciferase reporter gene under the control of the CMV early promoter are shown. Chimeric constructs containing either the SV40 polyadenylation signal or deletion mutants of the VEGF-D 3′-UTR were co-transfected with 1.85 μg of either empty vector or mutant β-catenin.

Statistical analysis was performed by using Student's test, and a value of p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. The Presence of Cellular Free β-Catenin Correlates with VEGF-D mRNA Down-regulation—VEGF-D expression is not induced by growth factors which is different from the other members of the VEGF family. We demonstrated previously in mouse fibroblasts that VEGF-D mRNA is induced by cell-cell contact mediated by cadherin-11, a calcium-dependent adhesive protein (29Orlandini M. Oliviero S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6576-6581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Depletion of calcium from the culture medium induced caherin-11 re-localization from the cell surface to the cytoplasm and VEGF-D mRNA degradation. In contacting cells the majority of β-catenin is localized at cell-cell contacts where it links the cytoplasmic tail of cadherins to the cytoskeleton. In epithelial cells a direct consequence of cadherin disassembly is the release of free β-catenin within the cytoplasm (47Pokutta S. Weis W.I. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We examined the fate of β-catenin in contacting mouse fibroblasts treated with EGTA by using anti-β-catenin antibodies (Fig. 1A). In untreated cells, a positive staining was revealed at intercellular contacts. In contrast, within 1 h after cell treatment with EGTA, the β-catenin signal disappeared from the cell surface and re-localized to the cytoplasm. The reintroduction of Ca2+ into the culture medium restored β-catenin staining at intercellular contacts. After 2 h from Ca2+ addition, the β-catenin signal was detectable both in the cytoplasm and at the cell-cell contact surfaces, while after 20 h it was mostly present at the intercellular junctions similarly to untreated cells. The presence of transcriptional active nuclear β-catenin could be demonstrated by transient transfection of a reporter gene containing multimeric responsive TCF-binding sites (TOPCAT) with respect to its control plasmid containing mutated TCF-binding sites (FOPCAT). A significant response to the β-catenin-TCF complex was measured by the TOPCAT construct in fibroblasts grown for 4 h in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 1C). The same EGTA treatment showed reduction of VEGF-D mRNA with lower levels at 4 and 6 h (Fig. 1B). VEGF-D mRNA levels were increased to values of the untreated cells at about 24 h after calcium reintroduction in the culture medium, thus suggesting that forced re-localization of free β-catenin to the cytoplasm induced an inhibitory signal on the VEGF-D mRNA expression. Wnt-1 Signaling Inhibits VEGF-D Expression—In cells, cytoplasmic levels of free β-catenin are maintained low via the proteasome-dependent degradation, as phosphorylated β-catenin is recognized by the F box factor β-TrCP (48Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 49Marikawa Y. Elinson R.P. Mech.

Wnt pathway down-regulates β-catenin phosphorylation via the activation of the Frizzled receptor, which induces down-regulation of GSK-3β-adenomatous polyposis coli-axin complex causing the accumulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin (51Barker N. Morin P.J. Clevers H. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 77: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 52Huelsken J. Behrens J. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3977-3978Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the degradation of VEGF-D mRNA could be modulated via the Wnt signaling pathway, we generated stable clones constitutively expressing Wnt-1, which acts as an autocrine factor on the Frizzled receptor (42Young C.S. Kitamura M. Hardy S. Kitajewski J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2474-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, clones W1-1 and W1-34 expressed high levels of Wnt-1, whereas clone W1-18 expressed lower levels of the factor. As expected, wild-type cells showed low levels of TOPCAT activity, whereas clones expressing Wnt-1 showed significantly higher expression of TOPCAT promoter (Fig. 2C). According to our previous results, wild-type fibroblasts expressed low levels of VEGF-D mRNA at low cell density, while it increased after a few days of growth when cells reached confluence (29Orlandini M.

It is a potent chemoattractant factor for CD4+ T-cells and regulates proliferation and activation of lymphocytes and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (2Center D.M. Kornfeld H. Ryan T.C.

Immunology. 2000; 100: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). IL-16 functions also as an inhibitor of human and simian immunodeficiency virus replication and induces signaling via binding to the CD4 cell surface receptor (7Baier M. Werner A. Bannert N. Metzner K. Kurth R. Nature. 1995; 378: 563Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 8Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. Nisar N. Wu M. Natke B. Theodore A.C. Kornfeld H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cytokine is synthesized as a large precursor protein and is released as a C-terminal 121-amino acid fragment after cleavage by caspase-3, reminiscent of the processing of pro-IL-1 by caspase-1 (9Zhang Y. Center D.M. Wu D.M. Cruikshank W.W. Yuan J. Andrews D.W. Kornfeld H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1144-1149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 10Baier M. Bannert N. Werner A. Lang K. Kurth R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5273-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Two major forms of the IL-16 precursor are known. A 67-kDa protein (pro-IL-16) is almost exclusively expressed in leukocytes and lymphatic tissues, whereas the much larger 141-kDa neural precursor (npro-IL-16) seems to be confined to special neurons including CD4+ granule cells of the cerebellum and hippocampus (11Kurschner C. Yuzaki M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7770-7780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date only the sequence of mouse npro-IL-16 has been published (11Kurschner C. Yuzaki M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7770-7780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This protein represents an N-terminal extension of pro-IL-16 for which transcription is most likely induced by an alternative neural promoter, representing an unexpected connection between the immune system and the nervous system. Pro-IL-16 exhibits significant interspecies homology and contains three highly conserved PDZ domains (12Bannert N. Baier M. Werner A. Kurth R. Nature. 1996; 381: 30Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 13Bannert N. Adler H.S. Werner A. Baier M. Kurth R. Immunogenetics. 1998; 47: 390-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The npro-IL-16 comprises two further PDZ domains in addition to other putative interaction modules. PDZ domains are characteristic sequences of 80-90 amino acids that share a common fold (14Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). A typical interaction involves the association of the carboxyl end of the ligand with the peptide binding groove of the PDZ domain (15Hung A.Y. Sheng M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5699-5702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). It has been shown, however, that PDZ domains can also participate in other modes of protein interaction (16Hillier B.J. Christopherson K.S. Prehoda K.E. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Science. 1999; 284: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Proteins containing PDZ domains play crucial roles in the assembly of miscellaneous macromolecular signaling complexes and in the targeting of their components to specialized subcellular locations including synapses and other membrane microdomains (17Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). A predominantly indirect association with the cytoskeleton and cellular motor proteins is critical for the function of many of these proteins. Using a yeast two-hybrid approach, Kurschner and Yuzaki (11Kurschner C. Yuzaki M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7770-7780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) show subunits of NMDA receptors, inward rectifier, and voltage-gated potassium channels as well as the α1 subunit of the voltage-sensitive class C calcium channel to be binding partners of the two PDZ domains encoded exclusively in npro-IL-16. However, proteins interacting with the three C-terminal PDZ domains shared by both IL-16 precursor forms remain elusive (11Kurschner C. Yuzaki M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7770-7780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently it has been demonstrated that the HTLV type 1 tax protein interacts with the PDZ1 region of pro-IL-16 (18Wilson K.C. Center D.M. Cruikshank W.W. Zhang Y. Virology. 2003; 306: 60-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The presence of protein interaction domains in the IL-16 precursors strongly suggests that in addition to their function as a source of the cytokine, these proteins are involved in other cellular processes possibly related to the cleavage, transport, or release of the mature cytokine. Alternatively they may play a role in the targeting or clustering of receptors or signaling complexes, similar to other PDZ domain proteins. By identifying pro-IL-16 binding partners we attempt to further elucidate the intracellular functions of both IL-16 precursor proteins. Here we report the identification of three myosin phosphatase targeting subunits (MYPT1, MYPT2, and MBS85) as ligands of the second PDZ domain of pro-IL-16 and of the corresponding domain in human npro-IL-16. The interactions depend on a novel C-terminal binding motif for PDZ domains and reveal a previously unrecognized link between pro-IL-16 and cytoplasmic actin-myosin filaments, substantiated by the colocalization of pro-IL-16 with F-actin, myosin, and myosin phosphatase targeting subunits. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—Two-hybrid experiments were performed using the DupLEX-A system (OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD). Two commercially available cDNA libraries, an oligo(dT)-primed PBL library cloned into the pJG4-5 vector (OriGene) and a random-primed spleen library in the pYESTrp2 vector (Invitrogen) were utilized. The library plasmids were introduced into the EGY48 yeast strain previously transformed with the lacZ-reporter plasmid pSH18-34 (OriGen) and the pEG202/PDZ1-3 bait construct. The transformants were plated on yeast nitrogen base-(Gal) quadruple-minus plates (Leu-, Trp-, Ura-, and His-) containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) to detect potential positive blue colonies after 3-4 days at 30 °C. Plasmid DNA was isolated from these clones and transformed into the KC8 bacterial strain to recover the library plasmid. To confirm the screening results, recovered plasmids were reintroduced in combination with relevant and irrelevant control bait vectors into pSH18-34-containing EGY48 yeast. At least three colonies of each transformation were plated on glucose- or galactose-containing selective media, as recommended by the manufacturer. The library plasmid inserts with a confirmed interaction (blue yeast colonies) were sequenced. A similar two-hybrid test with mutants and subsequences of the pro-IL-16 bait and MYPT1, MYPT2, or MBS85 targets was used to identify the interacting protein regions. Plasmid Constructs and Primers for RT-PCR—The pEG202/PDZ1-3 bait plasmid was constructed by amplifying the PDZ1-3-containing pro-IL-16 sequence (aa 324-631) with the primer pair 5PDZ1 (5′-CAGGCTGGATCCCCATGACATCATCATCCAACGAAGAC) and 3PDZ3 (5′-GACATCGAATGCGGCCGCTAGGAGTCTCCAGCAGCTGT) and fusing it in-frame to the LEX-A protein of pEG202 (OriGene) utilizing the BamHI/NotI cloning sites. To localize the interacting region, subsequences of pEG202/PDZ1-3 consisting of the PDZ2-3 (aa 391-631), PDZ3 (aa 502-631), PDZ2 (aa 391-501, 405-501, and 405-473) and the two N-terminal PDZ domains of the npro-IL-16, nPDZ1-2 (aa 183-457), were amplified by PCR using primer pairs containing EcoRI/NotI restriction sites and cloned in-frame into pEG202. The mutation of the PDZ2 GLGF sequence to KSGS was introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), the oligonucleotide 5′-CACAAGGAGGAAGGTGCTAAGTCTGGGTCAAGCTTGGCAGGAGGAGCA, and a reverse complement version. The construct pYESTrp2/MYPT2-(953-982) was cloned by amplifying the C-terminal 30 aa and the subsequent 3′-untranslated region present in the retrieved library plasmid pYESTrp2/MYPT2-(855-982) using the sense primer 5′-ACTGAATTCTGATGAAGGTGTTAACAGAACTGAAAT and the pYesTrp reverse primer as the antisense primer. The amplified fragment was cloned in-frame with the activation domain into the empty pYESTrp2 vector (Invitrogen) using the EcoRI/NotI/restriction sites. The construct pYESTrp2/MYPT2-(962-982) was cloned in a similar way using the primer 5′-ACTGAATTCTGGACAACCAGAGGCTGAAAGATG as the sense primer. C-terminal MYPT2 target mutants for the yeast two-hybrid tests were created by PCR using pYESTrp2/MYPT2-(855-982) as template and the pYesTrp forward primer (OriGene) with the indicated antisense primer introducing the deletion or mutation: MYPT2-(855-978), 5′-ACTAATGTAAGCGGCCGCCTAGCTGATGACTCTGATGAGGGCACC; MYPT2-(855-980), 5′-ATAATGTAAGCGGCCGCCTACAGTTTGCTGATGACTCTGATGAG; MYPT2-(855-981), 5′-ATAATGTAAGCGGCCGCCTAGGACAGTTTGCTGATGACTCTGAT; MYPT2-(855-982+A), 5′-ATAATGTAAGCGGCCGCCTAAGCCTTGGACAGTTTGCTGATGACTCT; MYPT2-(855-982, K982A), 5′-ATAATGTAAGCGGCCGCCTAAGCGGACAGTTTGCTGATGACTCTGA; MYPT2-(855-982, S981A), 5′-ATAATGTAAGCGGCCGCCTACTTAGCCAGTTTGCTGATGACTCTGAT; MYPT2-(855-982, L980A), 5′-ATAATGTAAGCGGCCGCCTACTTGGAAGCTTTGCTGATGACTCTGAT. The amplified fragments were cloned into pYESTrp2 using the EcoRI/NotI restriction sites. For the production of His10-tagged PDZ2 (aa 391-501) and PDZ3 (aa 502-631), the respective cDNA sequence was PCR-amplified and cloned in-frame into the pET16b vector (Novagen) using the NdeI/BamHI restriction sites. GST fusion proteins of MYPT2 were created by amplifying aa 855-982 and a C-terminal 4-aa deletion mutant (aa 855-978) of MYPT2. The amplified fragments were cloned in-frame into the pGEX-5X-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) using the EcoRI/NotI sites. The pcDNA3/pro-IL-16-V5 construct was generated by fusing the DNA sequence coding for the V5 tag in-frame to the 3′ end of the pro-IL-16 cDNA. This was achieved by PCR using an antisense primer coding for the V5 tag and inserting the amplified pro-IL-16-V5 fragment into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Vectors encoding the cDNA sequence of MYPT2 and MYPT1 were a generous gift of Dr. Masaaki Ito (Mie University, Japan). The entire coding sequences of MYPT2 and MYPT1 were amplified and cloned into the pCMV-Tag3B vector (Stratagene) using the EcoRI/NotI restriction sites. The resulting pCMV/MYPT2 and pCMV/MYPT1 vectors allow the expression of the full-length proteins containing the Myc tag on the N terminus. The pCMV/MYPT2-(657-982), pCMV/MYPT2-(657-978), and pYesTrp2/MYPT1-(904-1030) constructs were made by PCR amplification of the indicated subsequence of MYPT2 or MYPT1 and insertion into pCMV3-Tag3B and pYesTrp2, respectively. The pXJ-FLAG-MBS85 plasmid for the expression of FLAG-MBS85 was contributed by Thomas Leung (Glaxo-IMCB Group, Singapore) and has been described previously (19Tan I. Ng C.H. Lim L. Leung T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21209-21216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For RT-PCR amplification of MYPT2 transcripts the primers Ex 20 (forw), 5′-ACCAGCCGTGTAGAAGAAGACAGCAAC; Ex 25 (rev), 5′-TCTTTCCTCATAAATCTGGAGCCTAGCC; Ex 13 (forw), 5′-AGCTACTCCTGTGCTCTCCATTACTGG, and In 13 (forw), 5′-CTGAGTTGAGACATCAGCAAGTGCTGG, were used. MYPT1 transcripts were amplified using the oligonucleotide 5′-AACCAGTTCTACATCAGCTGGTGATCG as forward primer and 5′-ACTGCCAATTATGGTCCACTGGGTTAC as reverse primer. For MBS85 amplification, 5′-GGAGGCTTTAGGACGCTGTATGCAGAG and 5′-GTGGCAGAAGCAGCTGTATAAATACGG were used as forward and reverse primers, respectively. Recombinant Proteins—His10-tagged PDZ2 and PDZ3 domains were produced in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) as described previously (7Baier M. Werner A. Bannert N. Metzner K. Kurth R. Nature. 1995; 378: 563Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Briefly, cultures in late logarithmic growth phase were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Bacterial pellets were frozen, thawed, and resuspended in 50 ml of PBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mg of lysozyme, 5-10 units of benzonase, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The suspension was sonicated and incubated on ice for 20-30 min. Recombinant proteins were extracted from cleared lysates by nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) followed by washes with PBS containing 10 mm imidazole. The fusion protein was eluted with 250 mm imidazole and dialyzed against PBS. Recombinant GST fusion proteins were produced in E. coli strain BL21. The pellet of induced cells was resuspended in 50 ml of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mg of lysozyme, 5-10 units of benzonase, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After sonication, the preparation was incubated on ice for 30 min and cleared by centrifugation. Glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) was added to adsorb the soluble GST fusion proteins. After extensive washing with PBS, the suspension was transferred to a column, and the recombinant protein was eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, buffer followed by a dialysis in PBS. In Vitro Binding Assays—3 μg of GST fusion proteins and 3 μg of the His10-PDZ domain containing purified recombinant proteins were diluted in 500 μl of GST binding buffer consisting of 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science). Glutathione-Sepharose 4B was added, and after a 2-h incubation at 4 °C on a rotator, the beads were extensively washed with binding buffer containing 0.02% SDS and no bovine serum albumin. After the final wash, the beads were resuspended in sample buffer, and bound proteins were analyzed by standard gel electrophoresis followed by Western blotting using INDIA His-Probe-HRP (Pierce) and the ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed using a BIAcore 1000 system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Similar amounts of GST fusion proteins of MYPT2-(855-982) and MYPT2-(855-978) were immobilized on CM5 sensor chips using an amine coupling kit. Association and dissociation reactions with several concentrations of His10-PDZ2 in running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% Surfactant P20) were detected as changes of the surface plasmon resonance signal expressed as resonance units. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—HEK 293T cells were transfected in 10-cm dishes using Superfect Reagent (Qiagen). For immunoprecipitation, transfected cells and primary PBLs were treated with 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitor mix) for 20 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation to remove cell debris. 0.5 μg of antibody and 20 μl of a 50% protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) suspension were added to the cleared lysates. For precipitation of proteins carrying V5, Myc, and FLAG tags, antibodies covalently linked to Sepharose were used. After a 4-h incubation at 4 °C on a rotator, the precipitates were washed 5 times with lysis buffer supplemented with 0.02% SDS to reduce unspecific binding. The precipitates were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), and detected by standard Western blotting using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Cell Culture—HEK 293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. COS-7 cells were cultured in CMRL (Connaught Medical Research Laboratories) medium containing the same supplements. PBLs were isolated on a Ficoll-Paque gradient and cultured for 3-4 days in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, 2 μg/ml phytohemagglutinin (Sigma), and 180 IU of interleukin-2 (Roche Applied Science). Antibodies—Anti-IL-16 clone 14.1, the IgG2A control, and the MYPT1-specific monoclonal antibody were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Goat polyclonal anti-IL-16 was obtained from R&D Systems. Monoclonal anti-V5 tag and anti-FLAG tag (M2) antibodies coupled to agarose beads, anti-FLAG (M2)-HRP, anti-mouse IgG-HRP used as secondary antibody in immunoblots, polyclonal rabbit anti-Myc, and rabbit anti-FLAG as well as the rabbit anti-myosin (smooth and skeletal muscle) serum used in confocal microscopy experiments were all purchased from Sigma. The monoclonal anti-V5 and anti-V5-HRP was obtained from Invitrogen. Anti-Myc (9E10) and control IgGs, free and immobilized on agarose, as well as the anti-Myc-HRP antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The goat anti-mouse IgGCy3 and goat anti-rabbit IgG-FITC were obtained from Dianova. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown in 6-well plates, transfected using Superfect Reagent (Qiagen), and transferred the next day into Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc). 24 h later, cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min, rinsed briefly in PBS, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min, and washed 3 times with PBS. After a 20 min incubation with blocking buffer (PBS with 1% Marvel nonfat milk) cells were incubated with the primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 60 min at 37 °C. F-actin was stained with FITC-phalloidin (Sigma). The slides were extensively washed with PBS, and the secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorophores were added for 30 min. After thorough washing steps with PBS, the cells were mounted in Mowiol. Images were obtained on a Zeiss (LSM510, Axioplan 2) confocal laser scanning microscope. Cloning of the Human Neural Pro-IL-16 cDNA—The human cerebellum Marathon-Ready cDNA (Clontech) and the pro-IL-16-specific antisense primer 5′-CAGTGGCAGCAGCTCTCTCGCTTCCTG were used to amplify the new cDNA sequence coding for the N-terminal region of human neural pro-IL-16. The sequence of the antisense primer corresponds to a segment of the 5′-untranslated region of pro-IL-16 expressed in lymphatic tissues (10Baier M. Bannert N. Werner A. Lang K. Kurth R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5273-5277Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Based on the amplified sequence, which exhibited high homology to the known mouse cDNA of neural pro-IL-16 (11Kurschner C. Yuzaki M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7770-7780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we identified the corresponding start codon of the human sequence. To generate a full-length cDNA sequence of the human neural pro-IL-16, the Marathon-Ready cDNA was used as template in a PCR with the sense primer 5′-ACAACAGGTACCGCCGCCATGGAGTCACACAGCCGCGCTGGA (KpnI site underlined) and antisense primer 5′-ATCAGGGAGCCCTCTTGGGTCTGAAGC to amplify the region of aa 1-811 of human npro-IL-16, which includes the single Hin-dIII site. Using this site, the amplified KpnI/HindIII fragment and a HindIII/NotI fragment, removed from the vector pcDNA3/pro-IL-16-V5, were fused in a ligation reaction with KpnI/NotI-digested pcDNA3-V5 to generate pcDNA/npro-IL-16-V5. The sequence of human npro-IL-16 reported in this paper was deposited in the GenBank™ data base (accession number AY324389) Identification of Myosin Phosphatase Targeting Subunits as Pro-IL-16-interacting Proteins—Yeast two-hybrid screens of a random-primed human spleen library and an oligo(dT)-primed PBL cDNA library were performed using the three PDZ domains (aa 324-631) of human pro-IL-16 as bait (Fig. 1A). Preliminary experiments showed no autoactivation of the EGY48 yeast strain by the lexA-PDZ1-3 fusion protein. Approximately 108 transformants of each library were analyzed. The screening of the spleen library resulted in 37 potentially positive clones. Restriction and sequence analysis revealed that 34 clones encoded the C-terminal region (aa 855-982 and 890-982) of MYPT2 (Fig. 1B). Among the 38 potential positives of the PBL library were 34 clones encoding two overlapping C-terminal sequences (aa 688-782 and 753-782) of MBS85 (Fig. 1B). The highly homologous C termini of MYPT2, MBS85, and the related protein MYPT1 (Fig. 1C) prompted us to determine the binding capacity of MYPT1 to the lexA-PDZ1-3 fusion bait. Introduction of an MYPT1 (aa 904-1030) prey construct and the pEG202/PDZ1-3 bait vector into competent yeast resulted in rapid growth of blue colonies on selective media similar to that after transformation with the isolated MYPT2 and MBS85 library plasmids. The results indicate that in addition to MYPT2 and MBS85, MYPT1 also interacts with the PDZ domains encoding pro-IL-16 region in yeast two-hybrid experiments. MYPT1, MYPT2, and MBS85 Isoforms Shown to Interact with Pro-IL-16 in the Yeast Two-hybrid Experiments Are Expressed in PBLs—Myosin phosphatase targeting subunits are expressed in a variety of cells and tissues including muscle, brain, and the spleen (19Tan I.

It has been shown that MYPT1 and MYPT2 are present in several variants or isoforms resulting from different splicing and use of an alternative promoter (22Arimura T. Suematsu N. Zhou Y.B. Nishimura J. Satoh S. Takeshita A. Kanaide H. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6073-6082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Not all of these variants encode the entire C-terminal regions shown to interact with the pro-IL-16 bait in the yeast two-hybrid experiments. In particular, the highly homologous terminal leucine zipper motif (Fig. 1C) is missing in MYPT2 variants containing exon 24, as shown by Arimura et al. (22Arimura T. Suematsu N. Zhou Y.B. Nishimura J. Satoh S. Takeshita A. Kanaide H. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6073-6082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Inclusion of this exon causes a frameshift resulting in an exchange of the very last 28 amino acids by 44 amino acids of exon 24. With respect to the high pro-IL-16 expression in stimulated PBL, we sought to confirm the presence of MYPT2, MBS85, and MYPT1 isoforms encoding the C-terminal leucine zipper by RT-PCR using isolated total mRNA and specific primers. For MYPT2 we extended the study by analyzing the expression of previously described variants (22Arimura T. Suematsu N. Zhou Y.B. Nishimura J. Satoh S. Takeshita A. Kanaide H. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6073-6082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, major fragments of 365 and 1188 nucleotides were produced by PCR using primers encoding cDNA sequences of exon 20 and 25 or 13 and 25, respectively. These sizes were expected for transcripts lacking exon 24 (containing the terminal leucine zipper). Transcripts comprising exon 24 result in slightly larger fragments of 546 and 1369 nucleotides, respectively. Faint bands with these sizes are detectable, indicative of their presence at much lower levels compared with isoforms containing the terminal leucine zipper. No fragment could be amplified using a sense primer encoding a sequence downstream of the alternative promoter of intron 13, indicating that it is silent in PBL and no M21 (small subunit) variants are expressed. Amplification of cDNA sequences with MBS85- and MYPT1-specific sense primers annealing upstream of the leucine zipper coding sequence and antisense primers binding downstream of the stop codon amplified only fragment sizes of 356 for MBS85 and 486 nucleotides for MYPT1, which are consistent with the pro-IL-16-interacting isoforms. Cloning and sequencing of all the major fragments confirmed the presence of the leucine zipper motifs. Thus, MYPT1, MYPT2, and MBS85 transcripts containing the C-terminal sequences shown to interact with pro-IL-16 in yeast two-hybrid experiments are all expressed in PBLs and seem to constitute the dominant isoforms. The PDZ2 Domain of pro-IL-16 Interacts with MYPT1, MYPT2, and MBS85—To identify the PDZ domain that mediates binding to the myosin phosphatase targeting subunits we made LexA fusion constructs of PDZ2-3, PDZ2, PDZ3, and neural PDZ1-2 and performed yeast two-hybrid experiments using the phosphatase targeting subunits as prey. As summarized in Table I, all constructs containing the PDZ2 domain showed binding, whereas no interaction was detected when PDZ3 or the neural PDZ1-2 domains were transformed. The latter construct interacted with the cytoplasmic region of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2A, confirming the results of Kurschner and Yuzaki (11Kurschn"

https://openalex.org/W1994580268,"Caveolin-1, a major protein of cell surface invaginations called caveolae, is currently believed to cycle between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments via the endocytotic pathway, at least for part of its itinerary. We studied the distribution of caveolin-1 in cell membranes, using ultrathin cryosections and freeze-fracture immunolabeling and found this protein not only in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane, but also in the exoplasmic leaflet of all intracellular membranes. This sidedness implies that caveolin-1 switches from one membrane leaflet to the other somewhere on its way through the cell and rules out the classic mechanism of endocytotic membrane budding and fusion for caveolin-1 intracellular trafficking. Underlying the sidedness of caveolin-1 may be a fundamental, hitherto unrecognized, mechanism by which proteins transit membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2035874799,"The <i>E. coli</i> BglG protein inhibits transcription termination within the <i>bgl</i> operon in the presence of β-glucosides. BglG represents a family of transcriptional antiterminators that bind to RNA sequences, which partially overlap rho-independent terminators, and prevent termination by stabilizing an alternative structure of the transcript. The activity of BglG is determined by its dimeric state, which is modulated by reversible phosphorylation catalyzed by BglF, a PTS permease. Only the non-phosphorylated BglG dimer binds to RNA and allows read-through of transcription. BglG is composed of three domains: an RNA-binding domain followed by two domains, PRD1 and PRD2 (PTS regulation domains), which are similar in their sequence and folding. Based on the three-dimensional structure of dimeric LicT, a BglG homologue from <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, the interactions within the dimer are PRD1-PRD1 and PRD2-PRD2. We have shown before that PRD2 mediates homodimerization very efficiently. Using genetic systems and <i>in vitro</i> techniques that assay and characterize protein-protein interactions, we show here that the PRD1 dimerizes very slowly, but once it does, the homodimers are stable. These results support our model that formation of BglG dimers initiates with PRD2 dimerization followed by zipping up of two BglG monomers to create the active RNA-binding domain. Moreover, our results demonstrate that PRD1 and PRD2 heterodimerize efficiently <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. The affinity among the PRDs is in the following order: PRD2-PRD2 > PRD1-PRD2 > PRD1-PRD1. The interaction between PRD1 and PRD2 offers an explanation for the requirement of conserved residues in PRD1 for the phosphorylation of PRD2 by BglF."
https://openalex.org/W1978791874,"Based on our previous results, we investigated whether cyclosporin A (CsA)-induced vasopressin type 1A receptor up-regulation was mediated by free radicals. We report that CsA analogues with different affinities for cyclophilin and calcineurin were able to up-regulate vasopressin type 1A receptor and to generate free radicals in smooth muscle cells independently of calcineurin. Further, we demonstrate that the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine blocked the increase in vasopressin type 1A receptor mRNA and protein levels induced by CsA and that low concentrations of prooxidants were able to directly increase vasopressin type 1A receptor mRNA and protein levels. In addition, short exposure to CsA or pro-oxidants was sufficient to significantly increase vasopressin type 1A receptor mRNA and protein levels. Using cell-permeable forms of superoxide dismutase and catalase, we finally show that superoxide mediates the CsA-induced effects on vasopressin type 1A receptor. These results provide strong evidence that CsA-induced superoxide generation is causally involved in vasopressin type 1A receptor expression and demonstrate for the first time that low physiological concentrations of radicals, most probably superoxide, are able to directly affect cellular signaling to increase vasopressin type 1A receptor expression in rat aortic smooth muscle cells.

Thus, ROS seem to play a role as activators of signaling pathways leading to altered gene expression.Using CsA analogues with different capacities to bind cyclophilin and calcineurin we demonstrate that CsA generates ROS and up-regulates V1A receptor in RASMC independently of cyclophilin and calcineurin. Further, we report that CsA generates superoxide and that it is likely the superoxide anion radical that is able to directly increase V1A receptor expression at the mRNA and protein levels.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals and Buffers—CsA, cyclosporin H (CsH), and PSC 833 were gifts from Novartis Pharma (Basel, Switzerland), and CsA analogues (cyclosporin C (CsC), [EtLeu4]CsA, [MeVal4]CsA, [EtVal4]CsA, [MeIle4]CsA, and [MeAla3EtVal4]CsA) were synthesized in the laboratory of M. Mutter. Fetal calf serum, oligo(dT) 12–18 primer, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, dithiothreitol, and first strand buffer were from Invitrogen. Ciproxin was purchased from Bayer Pharma AG (Zürich, Switzerland), and 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (2′,7′-DCFH) was from Molecular Probes. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), polyethylene glycol-coupled bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD), polyethylene glycol-coupled bovine liver catalase (PEG-CAT), hydrogen peroxide, hypoxanthine, xanthine oxidase, and N-acetyl-l-cysteine were from Sigma, and tert-butylhydroperoxide was from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Dimethylnaphthoquinone was purchased from Alexis Corporation (Läufelfingen, Switzerland), and α-tocopherol was from Calbiochem. [3H][Arg8]vasopressin ([3H]AVP) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and [Arg8]vasopressin (AVP) was from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiashredder columns, and Taq DNA polymerase were from Qiagen. RQ1 RNase-free DNase and dNTPs were purchased from Promega. TaqMan probes and 2xTaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Primers were custom synthesized by Qiagen. Stock solutions of chemicals were prepared in ethanol, buffer, or Me2SO. CsA stock solutions were prepared in ethanol at a concentration of 10 mm and diluted to either 1 or 10 μm for experiments, thus resulting in maximal final EtOH concentration of 0.1%. Fresh CsA stock solutions were prepared every week. In all experiments, 0.1% EtOH or Me2SO served as control and were set at 100%. The physiological salt solution contained 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 5mm Hepes, and 10 mm glucose, adjusted to pH 7.6.Cultures of Smooth Muscle Cells—RASMC were prepared from aortae of male Wistar Kyoto rats (200–300 g) as described (9Lo Russo A. Passaquin A.C. André P. Skutella M. Ruegg U.T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). RASMC were cultured in DMEM supplemented with essential and non-essential amino acids, vitamins, 10 μg/ml ciproxin, and 10% fetal calf serum and kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. For studies with CsA, cells were used at confluence (after 7 to 9 days of culture) between passages 6 and 11. Twenty-four h before experiments, culture media were replaced with fresh DMEM without fetal calf serum. Treatment of RASMC with CsA and other agents was always performed in serum-free DMEM.[3H]AVP Binding—Binding experiments were carried out as described (13Cottet-Maire F. Avdonin P.V. Roulet E. Buetler T.M. Mermod N. Ruegg U.T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Results are expressed in percent of control to normalize for inter-experimental variations. Control values ranged from 0.5 to 4.2 fmol/well in different experiments, and the intra-experimental variability was less than 5%.Measurements of ROS by 2′, 7′-DCFH—ROS measurements were performed as outlined in Ref. 20Krauskopf A.

Results are expressed in percent of control to normalize for inter-experimental variations. Because of the variability between experiments, the gain applied to the photomultiplier tube was adjusted before each experiment.Isolation of Total RNA, DNase Treatment, and Reverse Transcription—Total RNA from RASMC cultured in 6-well plates was isolated using a RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. All RNAs were quantified by spectrophotometrical determination of the absorption at 260 nm. The RNA integrity was assessed by electrophoresis in non-denaturing 1.2% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. DNase treatment and reverse transcription were executed as described (13Cottet-Maire F. Avdonin P.V. Roulet E. Buetler T.M. Mermod N. Ruegg U.T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Real-time Quantitative PCR Analysis—Real-time quantitative PCR analysis was performed with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 7700 Sequence Detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as illustrated (13Cottet-Maire F. Avdonin P.V. Roulet E. Buetler T.M. Mermod N. Ruegg U.T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Results were normalized for GAPDH expression for each sample. Results are expressed in percent of control to normalize for inter-experimental variations. V1A receptor/GAPDH ratios of controls varied from 0.51 to 1.04 in different experiments, and the intra-experimental variability was less than 5%.Data Analysis—Results are presented as the means of at least three independent experiments with bars indicating S.E. Statistical evaluation was performed by means of one-way analysis of variance followed by Newman Keuls or Dunnett post-tests using the software lnPlotPrism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Differences with a value of p < 0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSCsA and Analogues Up-regulate the V1A Receptor—To investigate whether CsA depended on its binding to cyclophilin and/or calcineurin to up-regulate V1A receptor, we tested whether CsA analogues with differential affinities for cyclophilin and/or calcineurin affected V1A receptor expression. Like CsA, the analogues CsC and [EtLeu4]CsA bind both to cyclophilin and calcineurin. [MeVal4]CsA, [EtVal4]CsA, [MeIle4]-CsA, and [MeAla3EtVal4]CsA do not bind to calcineurin but have a high binding affinity for cyclophilin. The analogues CsH and PSC 833 bind to neither cyclophilin nor calcineurin. Fig. 1 illustrates that all analogues (tested at 1 μm) were able to significantly increase V1A receptor expression in RASMC after a 20-h pretreatment at 37 °C. This response was of similar magnitude as for CsA (about 3-fold), thus suggesting that CsA-induced V1A receptor up-regulation occurred independently of cyclophilin and/or calcineurin inhibition.ROS Formation by CsA Analogues in RASMC—As V1A receptor up-regulation appears to occur independently of the calcineurin/NF-AT pathway, we investigated whether ROS could be involved. To assess whether CsA requires cyclophilin and/or calcineurin for the generation of ROS, we tested whether analogues of CsA would be able to generate ROS. Because the oxidation of 2′, 7′-DCFH has been used in many laboratories to detect cellular radical formation (33Rosenkranz A.R. Schmaldienst S. Stuhlmeier K.M. Chen W. Knapp W. Zlabinger G.J. J.

Cells were treated with CsA or the CsA analogues tested for V1A receptor up-regulation and 2′, 7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) fluorescence was measured after 1 h. Fig. 2 demonstrates that all analogues were able to produce ROS. From these results, we conclude that CsA and analogues generate ROS independently of their ability to bind to cyclophilin and/or calcineurin. In experiments that are not shown, we verified that ROS formation by CsA analogues were blocked by antioxidants.Fig. 2ROS formation by CsA and analogues. RASMC were treated with CsA or analogues (10 μm) for 1 h at 37 °C, and DCF-fluorescence was measured. Dark gray bars represent CsA analogues that bind to both cyclophilin and calcineurin, light gray bars represent CsA analogues that only bind to cyclophilin but not to calcineurin, and white bars represent CsA analogues that bind neither to cyclophilin nor calcineurin.

Because it is known that several transcription factors are regulated by changes in the redox balance, the two antioxidants N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and α-tocopherol were tested on CsA-induced increase in V1A receptor mRNA and protein levels. Fig. 3 reveals that NAC was not only able to block the increase in V1A receptor mRNA levels induced by CsA after a 6-h treatment (A), but this antioxidant also decreased CsA-induced V1A receptor protein up-regulation after a 20-h treatment (B). The apparently higher levels of [3H]AVP binding in cells treated with CsA and NAC were statistically not different from control. Co-treatment of RASMC with CsA and α-tocopherol was equally effective in blocking CsA-induced V1A receptor up-regulation (data not shown).Fig. 3Effect of antioxidants on CsA-mediated increase in V1A receptor mRNA (A) and protein (B) levels. A, RASMC were exposed to CsA (1 or 10 μm) alone or in the presence of NAC during 6 h at 37 °C. V1A receptor mRNA levels were measured by real-time quantitative PCR and were normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels. B, RASMC were treated with CsA (1 or 10 μm) in the presence or absence of NAC for 20 h at 37 °C, and [3H]AVP binding was measured at the end. Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate or quadruplicate. Asterisks indicate values significantly different from CsA alone (1 or 10 μm) at p < 0.01 (**) or at p < 0.001 (***).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Pro-oxidants on V1A Receptor mRNA and Protein Levels—The fact that antioxidants were able to block CsA-mediated increase in V1A receptor mRNA and protein levels suggests that CsA-induced ROS generation may be responsible for this effect. To address this question, RASMC were treated with the peroxides hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or tert-butylhydroperoxide (BHP) or the superoxide-generating systems dimethylnaphthoquinone (DMNQ) or hypoxanthine (HX)/xanthine oxidase (XO). V1A receptor mRNA expression was determined 6 h after treatment, and V1A receptor protein expression was determined 20 h after treatment. As shown in Fig. 4, all pro-oxidants were able to significantly increase V1A receptor mRNA (A) and V1A receptor protein (B) levels in RASMC.Fig. 4Effect of pro-oxidants on V1A receptor mRNA (A) and protein (B) levels. A, RASMC were treated with CsA (3 μm) or the pro-oxidants H2O2 (30 μm), BHP (3 μm), DMNQ (10 nm), or HX (10 μm)/XO (1 milliunit/ml) during 6 h at 37 °C. V1A receptor mRNA levels were determined by quantitative real-time PCR and were normalized to GAPDH mRNA levels. B, analysis of [3H]AVP binding after 20 h of treatment was performed with CsA (1 μm) or the same pro-oxidants as under A was measured. Results are means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments done in triplicate or quadruplicate.

Avdonin P.V. Roulet E. Buetler T.M. Mermod N. Ruegg U.T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that the effect of CsA on receptor protein expression was preceded by an increase in V1A receptor mRNA levels starting at 2 h and peaking at 6–10 h after CsA addition (13Cottet-Maire F. Avdonin P.V. Roulet E. Buetler T.M. Mermod N. Ruegg U.T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These data suggest that shorter times of CsA exposure may be sufficient to induce V1A receptor up-regulation. If ROS are the critical mediators of this response, it is questionable whether ROS are produced for the full 20 h. Our data have shown that CsA-induced ROS generation was increased within the first hour, peaking at 45 min, followed by a steady decline up to 2 h (20Krauskopf A. Buetler T.M. Nguyen N.S.D. Mace K. Ruegg U.T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 135: 977-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Additional investigations have shown that after 20 h CsA does no longer generate any detectable levels of ROS when incubated with 2′, 7′-DCFH for the last hour (data not shown). Also, the pro-oxidants used in Fig. 4 very likely produced ROS only for a limited time before either the substrate was exhausted (HX), or the chemical was inactivated (H2O2, BHP, DMNQ). Therefore, we investigated whether short exposure of RASMC to CsA or pro-oxidants was sufficient to trigger V1A receptor up-regulation detected after 20 h. For this, cells were incubated with either CsA or DMNQ or HX/XO for 30 min or 1 h. Then the compounds were removed, and the cells were incubated in medium without compounds for a total time of 20 h before [3H]AVP binding was measured. Fig. 5 shows that exposure of RASMC to CsA or pro-oxidants for as little as 30 min was sufficient to significantly up-regulate V1A receptors after 20 h.Fig. 5Effect of CsA and pro-oxidant exposure time on V1A receptor expression. RASMC were exposed at 37 °C to CsA (10 μm)or the pro-oxidants DMNQ (10 nm) or HX (10 μm)/XO (1 milliunit/ml) for 30 min, 1 h, or 20 h. [3H]AVP binding was measured after 20 h (for details see text). Data are means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate.

Minor Jr., R. White C. Repine J. Rosen G. Freeman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6884-6892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Cai H. Li Z. Dikalov S. Holland S.M. Hwang J. Jo H. Dudley Jr., S.C. Harrison D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48311-48317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). RASMC were pretreated for 6 h with PEG-SOD (100 units/ml) or PEG-CAT (50 units/ml), and DCF-fluorescence and [3H]AVP binding were determined in the presence or absence of CsA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 6A shows that PEG-SOD increased the CsA-induced DCF-signal whereas PEG-CAT decreased this signal. On the other hand, PEG-SOD decreased CsA-mediated V1A receptor up-regulation whereas PEG-CAT had no effect (Fig. 6B). These results imply that CsA generated O2·¯ and that O2·¯ , but not H2O2, acted as mediator in V1A receptor up-regulation. Neither PEG-SOD nor PEG-CAT alone had a significant effect on basal ROS formation or [3H]AVP binding (data not shown).Fig. 6Effect of PEG-SOD and PEG-CAT on CsA-mediated increase in ROS generation (A) and [3H]AVP binding (B). RASMC were pretreated for 6 h at 37 °C with PEG-SOD (100 units/ml) or PEG-CAT (50 units/ml) in culture medium without serum. A, the medium was changed with medium containing CsA (1 μm) but no PEG-SOD or PEG-CAT, and DCF-fluorescence was determined 1 h later. B, the medium was changed with medium containing CsA (1 μm) but no PEG-SOD or PEG-CAT, and [3H]AVP binding was measured 24 h later. Data are means ± S.E. of at least four independent experiments performed in triplicate. Asterisks indicate values significantly different from CsA at p < 0.01 (**) or at p < 0.001 (***).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn this study, we provide evidence that superoxide serves as mediator in CsA-induced increase in V1A receptor mRNA and protein expression whereas the contribution of the calcineurin/NF-AT pathway in this effect is negligible."
