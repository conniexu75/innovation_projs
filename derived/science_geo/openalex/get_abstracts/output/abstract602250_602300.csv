https://openalex.org/W2782053762,"There has been much research on sex differences in the ability to recognise facial expressions of emotions, with results generally showing a female advantage in reading emotional expressions from the face. However, most of the research to date has used static images and/or 'extreme' examples of facial expressions. Therefore, little is known about how expression intensity and dynamic stimuli might affect the commonly reported female advantage in facial emotion recognition. The current study investigated sex differences in accuracy of response (Hu; unbiased hit rates) and response latencies for emotion recognition using short video stimuli (1sec) of 10 different facial emotion expressions (anger, disgust, fear, sadness, surprise, happiness, contempt, pride, embarrassment, neutral) across three variations in the intensity of the emotional expression (low, intermediate, high) in an adolescent and adult sample (N = 111; 51 male, 60 female) aged between 16 and 45 (M = 22.2, SD = 5.7). Overall, females showed more accurate facial emotion recognition compared to males and were faster in correctly recognising facial emotions. The female advantage in reading expressions from the faces of others was unaffected by expression intensity levels and emotion categories used in the study. The effects were specific to recognition of emotions, as males and females did not differ in the recognition of neutral faces. Together, the results showed a robust sex difference favouring females in facial emotion recognition using video stimuli of a wide range of emotions and expression intensity variations."

Building on the idea that systemic effects of CHD risk factors are a conglomeration of genetic and environmental factors, we use machine learning techniques and integrate genetic, epigenetic and phenotype data from the Framingham Heart Study to build and test a Random Forest classification model for symptomatic CHD. Our classifier was trained on n = 1,545 individuals and consisted of four DNA methylation sites, two SNPs, age and gender. The methylation sites and SNPs were selected during the training phase. The final trained model was then tested on n = 142 individuals. The test data comprised of individuals removed based on relatedness to those in the training dataset. This integrated classifier was capable of classifying symptomatic CHD status of those in the test set with an accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 78%, 0.75 and 0.80, respectively. In contrast, a model using only conventional CHD risk factors as predictors had an accuracy and sensitivity of only 65% and 0.42, respectively, but with a specificity of 0.89 in the test set. Regression analyses of the methylation signatures illustrate our ability to map these signatures to known risk factors in CHD pathogenesis. These results demonstrate the capability of an integrated approach to effectively model symptomatic CHD status. These results also suggest that future studies of biomaterial collected from longitudinally informative cohorts that are specifically characterized for cardiac disease at follow-up could lead to the introduction of sensitive, readily employable integrated genetic-epigenetic algorithms for predicting onset of future symptomatic CHD."
https://openalex.org/W2782341938,"Roads are a main threat to biodiversity conservation in the Amazon, in part, because roads increase access for hunters. We examine how increased landscape access by hunters may lead to cascading effects that influence the prey community and abundance of the jaguar (Panthera onca), the top Amazonian terrestrial predator. Understanding such ecological effects originating from anthropogenic actions is essential for conservation and management of wildlife populations in areas undergoing infrastructure development. Our study was conducted in Yasuní Biosphere Reserve, the protected area with highest potential for jaguar conservation in Ecuador, and an area both threatened by road development and inhabited by indigenous groups dependent upon bushmeat. We surveyed prey and jaguar abundance with camera traps in four sites that differed in accessibility to hunters and used site occupancy and spatially explicit capture-recapture analyses to evaluate prey occurrence and estimate jaguar density, respectively. Higher landscape accessibility to hunters was linked with lower occurrence and biomass of game, particularly white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari) and collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), the primary game for hunters and prey for jaguars. Jaguar density was up to 18 times higher in the most remote site compared to the most accessible site. Our results provide a strong case for the need to: 1) consider conservation of large carnivores and other wildlife in policies about road construction in protected areas, 2) coordinate conservation initiatives with local governments so that development activities do not conflict with conservation objectives, and 3) promote development of community-based strategies for wildlife management that account for the needs of large carnivores."
https://openalex.org/W2781738339,"Familial cerebral cavernous malformations type III (fCCM3) is a disease of the cerebrovascular system caused by loss-of-function mutations in ccm3 that result in dilated capillary beds that are susceptible to hemorrhage. Before hemorrhage, fCCM3 lesions are characterized by a hyperpermeable blood-brain barrier (BBB), the key pathologic feature of fCCM3. We demonstrate that connexin 43 (Cx43), a gap junction (GJ) protein that is incorporated into the BBB junction complex, is up-regulated in lesions of a murine model of fCCM3. Small interfering RNA-mediated ccm3 knockdown (CCM3KD) in brain endothelial cells in vitro increased Cx43 protein expression, GJ plaque size, GJ intracellular communication (GJIC), and barrier permeability. CCM3KD hyperpermeability was rescued by GAP27, a peptide gap junction and hemichannel inhibitor of Cx43 GJIC. Tight junction (TJ) protein, zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1), accumulated at Cx43 GJs in CCM3KD cells and displayed fragmented staining at TJs. The GAP27-mediated inhibition of Cx43 GJs in CCM3KD cells restored ZO-1 to TJ structures and reduced plaque accumulation at Cx43 GJs. The TJ protein, Claudin-5, was also fragmented at TJs in CCM3KD cells, and GAP27 treatment lengthened TJ-associated fragments and increased Claudin 5-Claudin 5 transinteraction. Overall, we demonstrate that Cx43 GJs are aberrantly increased in fCCM3 and regulate barrier permeability by a TJ-dependent mechanism.-Johnson, A. M., Roach, J. P., Hu, A., Stamatovic, S. M., Zochowski, M. R., Keep, R. F., Andjelkovic, A. V.

https://openalex.org/W2782124946,"Transactive response DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) is involved in gene regulation via the control of RNA transcription, splicing, and transport. TDP-43 is a major protein component of ubiquinated inclusions that are found in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); however, the function of TDP-43 at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and its role in ALS pathogenesis is largely unknown. Here, we show that TDP-43Q331K mutation in mice resulted in impaired neurotransmission by age 3 mo, preceding deficits in motor function and motor neuron loss, which were observed from age 10 mo. These defects were in the effective fusion and release of synaptic vesicles within the motor nerve terminal and manifested in decreased quantal content and reduced probability of quantal release. We observed morphologic alterations that were associated with the TDP-43Q331K mutation, such as aberrant innervation patterns and the distribution of synaptic vesicle-related proteins, which is indicative of a failing NMJ undergoing synaptic remodeling. These findings support a growing acceptance that dysregulation of the NMJ function is a key early event in the pathology of ALS.—Chand, K. K., Lee, K. M., Lee, J. D, Qiu, H., Willis, E.

https://openalex.org/W2782228766,"Background In the 2015 NOAA Dengue Challenge, participants made three dengue target predictions for two locations (Iquitos, Peru, and San Juan, Puerto Rico) during four dengue seasons: 1) peak height (i.e., maximum weekly number of cases during a transmission season; 2) peak week (i.e., week in which the maximum weekly number of cases occurred); and 3) total number of cases reported during a transmission season. A dengue transmission season is the 12-month period commencing with the location-specific, historical week with the lowest number of cases. At the beginning of the Dengue Challenge, participants were provided with the same input data for developing the models, with the prediction testing data provided at a later date. Methods Our approach used ensemble models created by combining three disparate types of component models: 1) two-dimensional Method of Analogues models incorporating both dengue and climate data; 2) additive seasonal Holt-Winters models with and without wavelet smoothing; and 3) simple historical models. Of the individual component models created, those with the best performance on the prior four years of data were incorporated into the ensemble models. There were separate ensembles for predicting each of the three targets at each of the two locations. Principal findings Our ensemble models scored higher for peak height and total dengue case counts reported in a transmission season for Iquitos than all other models submitted to the Dengue Challenge. However, the ensemble models did not do nearly as well when predicting the peak week. Conclusions The Dengue Challenge organizers scored the dengue predictions of the Challenge participant groups. Our ensemble approach was the best in predicting the total number of dengue cases reported for transmission season and peak height for Iquitos, Peru."
https://openalex.org/W2782476209,"Traffic congestion brings not only delay and inconvenience, but other associated national concerns, such as greenhouse gases, air pollutants, road safety issues and risks. Identification, measurement, tracking, and control of urban recurrent congestion are vital for building a livable and smart community. A considerable amount of works has made contributions to tackle the problem. Several methods, such as time-based approaches and level of service, can be effective for characterizing congestion on urban streets. However, studies with systemic perspectives have been minor in congestion quantification. Resilience, on the other hand, is an emerging concept that focuses on comprehensive systemic performance and characterizes the ability of a system to cope with disturbance and to recover its functionality. In this paper, we symbolized recurrent congestion as internal disturbance and proposed a modified metric inspired by the well-applied “R4” resilience-triangle framework. We constructed the metric with generic dimensions from both resilience engineering and transport science to quantify recurrent congestion based on spatial-temporal traffic patterns and made the comparison with other two approaches in freeway and signal-controlled arterial cases. Results showed that the metric can effectively capture congestion patterns in the study area and provides a quantitative benchmark for comparison. Also, it suggested not only a good comparative performance in measuring strength of proposed metric, but also its capability of considering the discharging process in congestion. The sensitivity tests showed that proposed metric possesses robustness against parameter perturbation in Robustness Range (RR), but the number of identified congestion patterns can be influenced by the existence of ϵ. In addition, the Elasticity Threshold (ET) and the spatial dimension of cell-based platform differ the congestion results significantly on both the detected number and intensity. By tackling this conventional problem with emerging concept, our metric provides a systemic alternative approach and enriches the toolbox for congestion assessment. Future work will be conducted on a larger scale with multiplex scenarios in various traffic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2781735131,"The prevalence of metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease, has rapidly increased, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying the metabolic syndrome, a primary risk factor, remain incompletely understood. The small, gaseous molecule carbon monoxide (CO) has well-known anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and antiapoptotic effects in a variety of cellular- and tissue-injury models, whereas its potential effects on the complex pathways of metabolic disease remain unknown. We demonstrate here that CO can alleviate metabolic dysfunction in vivo and in vitro. We show that CO increased the expression and section of the fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) in hepatocytes and liver. CO-stimulated PERK activation and enhanced the levels of FGF21 via the eIF2a-ATF4 signaling pathway. The induction of FGF21 by CO attenuated endoreticulum stress- or dietinduced, obesity-dependent hepatic steatosis. Moreover, CO inhalation lowered blood glucose levels, enhanced insulin sensitivity, and promoted energy expenditure by stimulating the emergence of beige adipose cells from white adipose cells. In conclusion, we suggest that CO acts as a potent inducer of FGF21 expression and that CO critically depends on FGF21 to regulate metabolic homeostasis.—Joe, Y., Kim, S., Kim, H.

https://openalex.org/W2781678589,"Background Pathological response of breast cancer to chemotherapy is a prognostic indicator for long-term disease free and overall survival. Responses of locally advanced breast cancer in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) settings are often variable, and the prediction of response is imperfect. The purpose of this study was to detect primary tumor responses early after the start of neoadjuvant chemotherapy using quantitative ultrasound (QUS), textural analysis and molecular features in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. Methods The study included ninety six patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Breast tumors were scanned with a clinical ultrasound system prior to chemotherapy treatment, during the first, fourth and eighth week of treatment, and prior to surgery. Quantitative ultrasound parameters and scatterer-based features were calculated from ultrasound radio frequency (RF) data within tumor regions of interest. Additionally, texture features were extracted from QUS parametric maps. Prior to therapy, all patients underwent a core needle biopsy and histological subtypes and biomarker ER, PR, and HER2 status were determined. Patients were classified into three treatment response groups based on combination of clinical and pathological analyses: complete responders (CR), partial responders (PR), and non-responders (NR). Response classifications from QUS parameters, receptors status and pathological were compared. Discriminant analysis was performed on extracted parameters using a support vector machine classifier to categorize subjects into CR, PR, and NR groups at all scan times. Results Of the 96 patients, the number of CR, PR and NR patients were 21, 52, and 23, respectively. The best prediction of treatment response was achieved with the combination mean QUS values, texture and molecular features with accuracies of 78%, 86% and 83% at weeks 1, 4, and 8, after treatment respectively. Mean QUS parameters or clinical receptors status alone predicted the three response groups with accuracies less than 60% at all scan time points. Recurrence free survival (RFS) of response groups determined based on combined features followed similar trend as determined based on clinical and pathology. Conclusions This work demonstrates the potential of using QUS, texture and molecular features for predicting the response of primary breast tumors to chemotherapy early, and guiding the treatment planning of refractory patients."
https://openalex.org/W2781757716,"This paper proposes a novel adaptive Super-Twisting sliding mode control for a microgyroscope under unknown model uncertainties and external disturbances. In order to improve the convergence rate of reaching the sliding surface and the accuracy of regulating and trajectory tracking, a high order Super-Twisting sliding mode control strategy is employed, which not only can combine the advantages of the traditional sliding mode control with the Super-Twisting sliding mode control, but also guarantee that the designed control system can reach the sliding surface and equilibrium point in a shorter finite time from any initial state and avoid chattering problems. In consideration of unknown parameters of micro gyroscope system, an adaptive algorithm based on Lyapunov stability theory is designed to estimate the unknown parameters and angular velocity of microgyroscope. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by simulation results. The comparative study between adaptive Super-Twisting sliding mode control and conventional sliding mode control demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W2950862267,"Combining high throughput sequencing with stable isotope probing (HTS-SIP) is a powerful method for mapping in situ metabolic processes to thousands of microbial taxa. However, accurately mapping metabolic processes to taxa is complex and challenging. Multiple HTS-SIP data analysis methods have been developed, including high-resolution stable isotope probing (HR-SIP), multi-window high-resolution stable isotope probing (MW-HR-SIP), quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP), and ΔBD. Currently, there is no publicly available software designed specifically for analyzing HTS-SIP data. To address this shortfall, we have developed the HTSSIP R package, an open-source, cross-platform toolset for conducting HTS-SIP analyses in a straightforward and easily reproducible manner. The HTSSIP package, along with full documentation and examples, is available from CRAN at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HTSSIP/index.html and Github at https://github.com/buckleylab/HTSSIP."
https://openalex.org/W2782424662,"Due to concerns over negative impacts on insect pollinators, the European Union has implemented a moratorium on the use of three neonicotinoid pesticide seed dressings for mass-flowering crops. We assessed the effectiveness of this policy in reducing the exposure risk to honeybees by collecting 130 samples of honey from bee keepers across the UK before (2014: N = 21) and after the moratorium was in effect (2015: N = 109). Neonicotinoids were present in about half of the honey samples taken before the moratorium, and they were present in over a fifth of honey samples following the moratorium. Clothianidin was the most frequently detected neonicotinoid. Neonicotinoid concentrations declined from May to September in the year following the ban. However, the majority of post-moratorium neonicotinoid residues were from honey harvested early in the year, coinciding with oilseed rape flowering. Neonicotinoid concentrations were correlated with the area of oilseed rape surrounding the hive location. These results suggest mass flowering crops may contain neonicotinoid residues where they have been grown on soils contaminated by previously seed treated crops. This may include winter seed treatments applied to cereals that are currently exempt from EU restrictions. Although concentrations of neonicotinoids were low (<2.0 ng g-1), and posed no risk to human health, they may represent a continued risk to honeybees through long-term chronic exposure."

Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular parasite that infects migratory cells and enhances their motility, but the mechanisms underlying T. gondii–induced hypermotility are incompletely understood. We investigated the molecular basis for the hypermotility of primary human peripheral blood monocytes and THP-1 cells infected with T. gondii. Compared with uninfected monocytes, T. gondii infection of monocytes reduced cell spreading and the number of activated β1 integrin clusters in contact with fibronectin during settling, an effect not observed in monocytes treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Escherichia coli. Furthermore, T. gondii infection disrupted the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at tyrosine 397 (Tyr-397) and Tyr-925 and of the related protein proline-rich tyrosine kinase (Pyk2) at Tyr-402. The localization of paxillin, FAK, and vinculin to focal adhesions and the colocalization of these proteins with activated β1 integrins were also impaired in T. gondii–infected monocytes. Using time-lapse confocal microscopy of THP-1 cells expressing enhanced GFP (eGFP)–FAK during settling on fibronectin, we found that T. gondii–induced monocyte hypermotility was characterized by a reduced number of enhanced GFP-FAK–containing clusters over time compared with uninfected cells. This study demonstrates an integrin conformation–independent regulation of the β1 integrin adhesion pathway, providing further insight into the molecular mechanism of T. gondii–induced monocyte hypermotility.

We report the crystal structures of the full-length Thermotoga maritima YidC (TmYidC) and the TmYidC periplasmic domain (TmPD) at a resolution of 3.8 and 2.5 Å, respectively. The crystal structure of TmPD reveals a β-supersandwich fold but with apparently shortened β strands and different connectivity, as compared to the Escherichia coli YidC (EcYidC) periplasmic domain (EcPD). TmYidC in a detergent-solubilized state also adopts a monomeric form and its conserved core domain, which consists of 2 loosely associated α-helical bundles, assemble a fold similar to that of the other YidC homologues, yet distinct from that of the archaeal YidC-like DUF106 protein. Functional analysis using in vivo photo-crosslinking experiments demonstrates that Pf3 coat protein, a Sec-independent YidC substrate, exits to the lipid bilayer laterally via one of the 2 α-helical bundle interfaces: TM3–TM5. Engineered intramolecular disulfide bonds in TmYidC, in combination with complementation assays, suggest that significant rearrangement of the 2 α-helical bundles at the top of the hydrophilic groove is critical for TmYidC function.

https://openalex.org/W2781748479,"Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD) produces reduced NADPH in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen. NADPH constitutes a cofactor for many reducing enzymes, and its inability to traverse biologic membranes makes in situ synthesis of NADPH in the ER lumen indispensable. The H6PD gene is amplified in several types of malignancies, and earlier work pointed toward a potential involvement of the enzyme in cancer cell growth. In the present study, we demonstrated a pivotal role of H6PD in proliferation and migratory potential of 3 human breast cancer cell lines. Knockdown of H6PD decreased proliferation and migration in SUM159, MCF7, and MDA-MB-453 cells. To understand the mechanism through which H6PD exerts its effects, we investigated the cellular changes after H6PD silencing in SUM159 cells. Knockdown of H6PD resulted in an increase in ER lumen oxidation, and down-regulation of many components of the unfolded protein response, including the transcription factors activating transcription factor-4, activating transcription factor-6, split X-box binding protein-1, and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous protein. This effect was accompanied by an increase in sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase-2 pump expression and an decrease in inositol trisphosphate receptor-III, which led to augmented levels of calcium in the ER. Further characterization of the molecular pathways involving H6PD could greatly broaden our understanding of how the ER microenvironment sustains malignant cell growth.-Tsachaki, M., Mladenovic, N., Štambergová, H., Birk, J., Odermatt, A.

https://openalex.org/W2782002033,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common genetic disease with significantly increased mortality. CF airways exhibit ion transport abnormalities, including hyperactivity of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). Short-palate lung and nasal epithelial clone 1 (SPLUNC1) is a multifunctional innate defense protein that is secreted into the airway lumen. We have previously demonstrated that SPLUNC1 binds to and inhibits ENaC to maintain fluid homeostasis in airway epithelia and that this process fails in CF airways. Despite this, how SPLUNC1 actually regulates ENaC is unknown. Here, we found that SPLUNC1 caused αγ-ENaC to internalize, whereas SPLUNC1 and β-ENaC remained at the plasma membrane. Additional studies revealed that SPLUNC1 increased neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4–2-dependent ubiquitination of α- but not β- or γ-ENaC. We also labeled intracellular ENaC termini with green fluorescent protein and mCherry, and found that extracellular SPLUNC1 altered intracellular ENaC Forster resonance energy transfer. Taken together, our data indicate that SPLUNC1 is an allosteric regulator of ENaC that dissociates abg-ENaC to generate a new SPLUNC1– β-ENaC complex. These data indicate a novel mode for regulating ENaC at the plasma membrane.—Kim, C. S., Ahmad, S., Wu, T., Walton, W. G., Redinbo, M. R., Tarran, R.

Analysis of scientific research in comorbidity and multimorbidity is limited in the biomedical literature. This study aimed to map global scientific research in comorbidity and multimorbidity to understand the maturity and growth of the area during the past decades. Methods and findings This was a cross-sectional analysis of the Web of Science. Searches were run from inception until November 8, 2016. We included research articles or reviews with no restrictions by language or publication date. Data abstraction was done by one researcher. A process of standardization was conducted by two researchers to unify different terms and grammatical variants and to remove typographical, transcription, and/or indexing errors. All potential discrepancies were resolved via discussion. Descriptive analyses were conducted (including the number of papers, citations, signatures, most prolific authors, countries, journals and keywords). Network analyses of collaborations between countries and co-words were presented. During the period 1970–2016, 85994 papers (64.0% in 2010–2016) were published in 3500 journals. There was wide diversity in the specialty of the journals, with psychiatry (16558 papers; 19.3%), surgery (9570 papers; 11.1%), clinical neurology (9275 papers; 10.8%), and general and internal medicine (7622 papers; 8.9%) the most common. PLOS One (1223 papers; 1.4%), the Journal of Affective Disorders (1154 papers; 1.3%), the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (727 papers; 0.8%), the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (634 papers; 0.7%) and Obesity Surgery (588 papers; 0.7%) published the largest number of papers. 168 countries were involved in the production of papers. The global productivity ranking was headed by the United States (37624 papers), followed by the United Kingdom (7355 papers), Germany (6899 papers) and Canada (5706 papers). Twenty authors who published 100 or more papers were identified; the most prolific authors were affiliated with Harvard Medical School, State University of New York Upstate Medical University, National Taiwan Normal University and China Medical University. The 50 most cited papers (“citation classics” with at least 1000 citations) were published in 20 journals, led by JAMA Psychiatry (11 papers) and JAMA (10 papers). The most cited papers provided contributions focusing on methodological aspects (e.g. Charlson Comorbidity Index, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, APACHE prognostic system), but also important studies on chronic diseases (e.g. epidemiology of mental disorders and its correlates by the U.S. National Comorbidity Survey, Fried’s frailty phenotype or the management of obesity). Conclusions Ours is the first analysis of global scientific research in comorbidity and multimorbidity. Scientific production in the field is increasing worldwide with research leadership of Western countries, most notably, the United States."
https://openalex.org/W2781883940,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited retinal dystrophies characterized by progressive and irreversible loss of vision due to rod and cone degeneration. Evidence suggests that an inappropriate oxygen level could contribute to its pathogenesis. Rod cell death could increase oxygen concentration, reduce hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1α) and contribute to cone cell death. The purposes of this study were: 1) to analyze the temporal profile of HIF-1α, its downstream effectors VEGF, endothelin-1 (ET-1), iNOS, and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1), and neuroinflammation in retinas of the murine model of rd10 (retinal degeneration 10) mice with RP; 2) to study oxygen bioavailability in these retinas; and 3) to investigate how stabilizing HIF-1α proteins with dimethyloxaloglycine (DMOG), a prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, affects retinal degeneration, neuroinflammation, and antioxidant response in rd10 mice. A generalized down-regulation of HIF-1α and its downstream targets was detected in parallel with reactive gliosis, suggesting high oxygen levels during retinal degeneration. At postnatal d 18, DMOG treatment reduced photoreceptor cell death and glial activation. In summary, retinas of rd10 mice seem to be exposed to a hyperoxic environment even at early stages of degeneration.

https://openalex.org/W2781754543,"The tendon-bone interface (enthesis) is a highly sophisticated biomaterial junction that allows stress transfer between mechanically dissimilar materials. The enthesis encounters very high mechanical demands and the regenerative capacity is very low resulting in high rupture recurrence rates after surgery. Tissue engineering offers the potential to recover the functional integrity of entheses. However, recent enthesis tissue engineering approaches have been limited by the lack of knowledge about the cells present at this interface. Here we investigated the cellular differentiation of enthesis cells and compared the cellular pattern of enthesis cells to tendon and cartilage cells in a next generation sequencing transcriptome study. We integrated the transcriptome data with proteome data of a previous study to identify biomarkers of enthesis cell differentiation. Transcriptomics detected 34468 transcripts in total in enthesis, tendon, and cartilage. Transcriptome comparisons revealed 3980 differentially regulated candidates for enthesis and tendon, 395 for enthesis and cartilage, and 946 for cartilage and tendon. An asymmetric distribution of enriched genes was observed in enthesis and cartilage transcriptome comparison suggesting that enthesis cells are more chondrocyte-like than tenocyte-like. Integrative analysis of transcriptome and proteome data identified ten enthesis biomarkers and six tendon biomarkers. The observed gene expression characteristics and differentiation markers shed light into the nature of the cells present at the enthesis. The presented markers will foster enthesis tissue engineering approaches by setting a bench-mark for differentiation of seeded cells towards a physiologically relevant phenotype."

Zinc was established to play a significant role in the growth, development, and maintenance of healthy bones; however, the mechanisms underlying zinc effects on the integrity of the skeleton are poorly understood. Here, we show that the zinc receptor (ZnR)/Gpr39 is required for normal bone matrix deposition by osteoblasts. Initial analysis showed that Gpr39-deficient (Gpr39−/−) mice had weaker bones as a result of altered bone composition. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis showed high mineral-to-matrix ratios in the bones of Gpr39−/− mice. Histologic analysis showed abnormally high numbers of active osteoblasts but normal osteoclast numbers on the surfaces of bones from Gpr39−/− mice. Furthermore, Gpr39−/− osteoblasts had disorganized matrix deposition in vitro with cultures exhibiting abnormally low collagen and high mineral contents, findings that demonstrate a cell-intrinsic role for ZnR/Gpr39 in these cells. We show that both collagen synthesis and deposition by Gpr39−/− osteoblasts are perturbed. Finally, the expression of the zinc transporter Zip13 and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs family of zinc-dependent metalloproteases that regulate collagen processing was downregulated in Gpr39−/− osteoblasts. Altogether, our results suggest that zinc sensing by ZnR/Gpr39 affects the expression levels of zinc-dependent enzymes in osteoblasts and regulates collagen processing and deposition.—Jovanovic, M., Schmidt, F.

https://openalex.org/W2785549007,"Terrestrial and marine wildlife populations have been severely reduced by hunting, fishing and habitat destruction, especially in the last centuries. Although management regulations have led to the recovery of some populations, the underlying processes are not always well understood. This study uses a 40-year time series of counts of harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) in the Wadden Sea to study these processes, and demonstrates the influence of historical regional differences in management regimes on the recovery of this population. While the Wadden Sea is considered one ecologically coupled zone, with a distinct harbour seal population, the area is divided into four geo-political regions i.e. the Netherlands, Lower Saxony including Hamburg, Schleswig-Holstein and Denmark. Gradually, seal hunting was banned between 1962 and 1977 in the different regions. Counts of moulting harbour seals and pup counts, obtained during aerial surveys between 1974 and 2014, show a population growth from approximately 4500 to 39,000 individuals. Population growth models were developed to assess if population growth differed between regions, taking into account two Phocine Distemper Virus (PDV) epizootics, in 1988 and 2002 which seriously affected the population. After a slow start prior to the first epizootic, the overall population grew exponentially at rates close to assumed maximum rates of increase in a harbour seal population. Recently, growth slowed down, potentially indicative of approaching carrying capacity. Regional differences in growth rates were demonstrated, with the highest recovery in Netherlands after the first PDV epizootic (i.e. 17.9%), suggesting that growth was fuelled by migration from the other regions, where growth remained at or below the intrinsic growth rate (13%). The seals’ distribution changed, and although the proportion of seals counted in the German regions declined, they remained by far the most important pupping region, with approximately 70% of all pups being born there. It is hypothesised that differences in hunting regime, preceding the protection in the 1960’s and 1970’s, created unbalance in the distribution of breeding females throughout the Wadden Sea, which prevailed for decades. Breeding site fidelity promoted the growth in pup numbers at less affected breeding sites, while recolonisation of new breeding areas would be suppressed by the philopatry displayed by the animals born there. This study shows that for long-lived species, variable management regimes in this case hunting regulations, across a species’ range can drive population dynamics for several generations."
https://openalex.org/W2782154521,"In threatened wildlife populations, it is important to determine whether observed low genetic diversity may be due to recent anthropogenic pressure or the consequence of historic events. Historical size of the Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) population inhabiting the Mekong River is unknown and there is significant concern for long-term survival of the remaining population as a result of low abundance, slow reproduction rate, high neonatal mortality, and continuing anthropogenic threats. We investigated population structure and reconstructed the demographic history based on 60 Irrawaddy dolphins samples collected between 2001 and 2009. The phylogenetic analysis indicated reciprocal monophyly of Mekong River Orcaella haplotypes with respect to haplotypes from other populations, suggesting long-standing isolation of the Mekong dolphin population from other Orcaella populations. We found that at least 85% of all individuals in the two main study areas: Kratie and Stung Treng, bore the same mitochondrial haplotype. Out of the 21 microsatellite loci tested, only ten were polymorphic and exhibited very low levels of genetic diversity. Both individual and frequency-based approaches suggest very low and non-significant genetic differentiation of the Mekong dolphin population. Evidence for recent bottlenecks was equivocal. Some results suggested a recent exponential decline in the Mekong dolphin population, with the current size being only 5.2% of the ancestral population. In order for the Mekong dolphin population to have any potential for long-term survival, it is imperative that management priorities focus on preventing any further population fragmentation or genetic loss, reducing or eliminating anthropogenic threats, and promoting connectivity between all subpopulations."
https://openalex.org/W2782469108,"Kelp forests provide important ecosystem services, yet coastal kelp communities are increasingly altered by anthropogenic impacts. Kelp forests in remote, offshore locations may provide an informative contrast due to reduced impacts from local stressors. We tested the hypothesis that shallow kelp assemblages (12-15 m depth) and associated fish and benthic communities in the coastal southwest Gulf of Maine (GOM) differed significantly from sites on Cashes Ledge, 145 km offshore by sampling five coastal and three offshore sites at 43.0 +/- 0.07° N latitude. Offshore sites on Cashes Ledge supported the greatest density (47.8 plants m2) and standing crop biomass (5.5 kg m2 fresh weight) of the foundation species Saccharina latissima kelp at this depth in the Western North Atlantic. Offshore densities of S. latissima were over 150 times greater than at coastal sites, with similar but lower magnitude trends for congeneric S. digitata. Despite these differences, S. latissima underwent a significant 36.2% decrease between 1987 and 2015 on Cashes Ledge, concurrent with a rapid warming of the GOM and invasion by the kelp-encrusting bryozoan Membranipora membranacea. In contrast to kelp, the invasive red alga Dasysiphonia japonica was significantly more abundant at coastal sites, suggesting light or dispersal limitation offshore. Spatial differences in fish abundance mirrored those of kelp, as the average biomass of all fish on Cashes Ledge was 305 times greater than at the coastal sites. Remote video censuses of cod (Gadus morhua), cunner (Tautaogolabrus adspersus), and pollock (Pollachius virens) corroborated these findings. Understory benthic communities also differed between regions, with greater abundance of sessile invertebrates offshore. Populations of kelp-consuming sea urchins Stronglyocentrotus droebachiensis, were virtually absent from Cashes Ledge while small urchins were abundant onshore, suggesting recruitment limitation offshore. Despite widespread warming of the GOM since 1987, extraordinary spatial differences in the abundance of primary producers (kelp), consumers (cod) and benthic communities between coastal and offshore sites have persisted. The shallow kelp forest communities offshore on Cashes Ledge represent an oasis of unusually high kelp and fish abundance in the region, and as such, comprise a persistent abundance hotspot that is functionally significant for sustained biological productivity of offshore regions of the Gulf of Maine."
https://openalex.org/W2782036536,"Albanerpetontids are an enigmatic fossil amphibian group known from deposits of Middle Jurassic to Pliocene age. The oldest and youngest records are from Europe, but the group appeared in North America in the late Early Cretaceous and radiated there during the Late Cretaceous. Until now, the Asian record has been limited to fragmentary specimens from the Late Cretaceous of Uzbekistan. This led to speculation that albanerpetontids migrated into eastern Asia from North America in the Albian to Cenomanian interval via the Beringian land bridge. However, here we describe albanerpetontid specimens from the Lower Cretaceous Kuwajima Formation of Japan, a record that predates their first known occurrence in North America. One specimen, an association of skull and postcranial bones from a single small individual, permits the diagnosis of a new taxon. High Resolution X-ray Computed Microtomography has revealed previously unrecorded features of albanerpetontid skull morphology in three dimensions, including the presence of a supraoccipital and epipterygoids, neither of which occurs in any known lissamphibian. The placement of this new taxon within the current phylogenetic framework for Albanerpetontidae is complicated by a limited overlap of comparable elements, most notably the non-preservation of the premaxillae in the Japanese taxon. Nonetheless, phylogenetic analysis places the new taxon closer to Albanerpeton than to Anoualerpeton, Celtedens, or Wesserpeton, although Bootstrap support values are weak. The results also question the monophyly of Albanerpeton as currently defined."
https://openalex.org/W2782291102,"A novel protein-folding function of RNA has been recognized, which can outperform previously known molecular chaperone proteins. The RNA as a molecular chaperone (chaperna) activity is intrinsic to some ribozymes and is operational during viral infections. Our purpose was to test whether influenza hemagglutinin (HA) can be assembled in a soluble, trimeric, and immunologically activating conformation by means of an RNA molecular chaperone (chaperna) activity. An RNA-interacting domain (RID) from the host being immunized was selected as a docking tag for RNA binding, which served as a transducer for the chaperna function for de novo folding and trimeric assembly of RID-HA1. Mutations that affect tRNA binding greatly increased the soluble aggregation defective in trimer assembly, suggesting that RNA interaction critically controls the kinetic network in the folding/assembly pathway. Immunization of mice resulted in strong hemagglutination inhibition and high titers of a neutralizing antibody, providing sterile protection against a lethal challenge and confirming the immunologically relevant HA conformation. The results may be translated into a rapid response to a new influenza pandemic. The harnessing of the novel chaperna described herein with immunologically tailored antigen-folding functions should serve as a robust prophylactic and diagnostic tool for viral infections.—Yang, S.

https://openalex.org/W2782356794,"Worldwide, more than one million people die on the roads each year. A third of these fatal accidents are attributed to speeding, with properties of the individual driver and the environment regarded as key contributing factors. We examine real-world speeding behavior and its interaction with illuminance, an environmental property defined as the luminous flux incident on a surface. Drawing on an analysis of 1.2 million vehicle movements, we show that reduced illuminance levels are associated with increased speeding. This relationship persists when we control for factors known to influence speeding (e.g., fluctuations in traffic volume) and consider proxies of illuminance (e.g., sight distance). Our findings add to a long-standing debate about how the quality of visual conditions affects drivers’ speed perception and driving speed. Policy makers can intervene by educating drivers about the inverse illuminance‒speeding relationship and by testing how improved vehicle headlights and smart road lighting can attenuate speeding."
https://openalex.org/W2782481894,"According to the Developmental Origin of Health and Disease (DOHaD) concept, maternal obesity and accelerated growth in neonates program obesity later in life. White adipose tissue (WAT) has been the focus of developmental programming events, although underlying mechanisms remain elusive. In rodents, WAT development primarily occurs during lactation. We previously reported that adult rat offspring from dams fed a high-fat (HF) diet exhibited fat accumulation and decreased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) mRNA levels in WAT. We hypothesized that PPARγ down-regulation occurs via epigenetic malprogramming which takes place during adipogenesis. We therefore examined epigenetic modifications in the PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 promoters in perirenal (pWAT) and inguinal fat pads of HF offspring at weaning (postnatal d 21) and in adulthood. Postnatal d 21 is a period characterized by active epigenomic remodeling in the PPARγ2 promoter (DNA hypermethylation and depletion in active histone modification H3ac and H3K4me3) in pWAT, consistent with increased DNA methyltransferase and DNA methylation activities. Adult HF offspring exhibited sustained hypermethylation and histone modification H3ac of the PPARγ2 promoter in both deposits, correlated with persistent decreased PPARγ2 mRNA levels. Consistent with the DOHaD hypothesis, retained epigenetic marks provide a mechanistic basis for the cellular memory linking maternal obesity to a predisposition for later adiposity.-Lecoutre, S., Pourpe, C., Butruille, L., Marousez, L., Laborie, C., Guinez, C., Lesage, J., Vieau, D., Eeckhoute, J., Gabory, A., Oger, F., Eberlé, D., Breton, C.

https://openalex.org/W2781519497,"Background Global brachial plexopathies cause major sensory and motor deficits in the affected arm and hand. Many patients report of psychosocial consequences including chronic pain, decreased self-sufficiency, and poor body image. Bionic reconstruction, which includes the amputation and prosthetic replacement of the functionless limb, has been shown to restore hand function in patients where classic reconstructions have failed. Patient selection and psychological evaluation before such a life-changing procedure are crucial for optimal functional outcomes. In this paper we describe a psychosocial assessment procedure for bionic reconstruction in patients with complete brachial plexopathies and present psychosocial outcome variables associated with bionic reconstruction. Methods Between 2013 and 2017 psychosocial assessments were performed in eight patients with global brachial plexopathies. We conducted semi-structured interviews exploring the psychosocial adjustment related to the accident, the overall psychosocial status, as well as motivational aspects related to an anticipated amputation and expectations of functional prosthetic outcome. During the interview patients were asked to respond freely. Their answers were transcribed verbatim by the interviewer and analyzed afterwards on the basis of a pre-defined item scoring system. The interview was augmented by quantitative evaluation of self-reported mental health and social functioning (SF-36 Health Survey), body image (FKB-20) and deafferentation pain (VAS). Additionally, psychosocial outcome variables were presented for seven patients before and after bionic reconstruction. Results Qualitative data revealed several psychological stressors with long-term negative effects on patients with complete brachial plexopathies. 88% of patients felt functionally limited to a great extent due to their disability, and all of them reported constant, debilitating pain in the deafferented hand. After bionic reconstruction the physical component summary scale increased from 30.80 ± 5.31 to 37.37 ± 8.41 (p-value = 0.028), the mental component summary scale improved from 43.19 ± 8.32 to 54.76 ± 6.78 (p-value = 0.018). VAS scores indicative of deafferentation pain improved from 7.8 to 5.6 after prosthetic hand replacement (p-value = 0.018). Negative body evaluation improved from 60.71 ± 12.12 to 53.29 ± 11.03 (p-value = 0.075). Vital body dynamics increased from 38.57 ± 13.44 to 44.43 ± 16.15 (p-value = 0.109). Conclusions Bionic reconstruction provides hope for patients with complete brachial plexopathies who have lived without hand function for years or even decades. Critical patient selection is crucial and the psychosocial assessment procedure including a semi-structured interview helps identify unresolved psychological issues, which could preclude or delay bionic reconstruction. Bionic reconstruction improves overall quality of life, restores an intact self-image and reduces deafferentation pain."
https://openalex.org/W2781851021,"Ethanol is one of the most commonly abused drugs and consequently its toxic and psychoactive effect has been widely investigated, although little is known about the time-dependent effects of this drug. In the present research zebrafish was used to assess daily rhythms in ethanol toxicity and behavioural effects, as well as the temporal pattern of expression of key genes involved in ethanol detoxification in the liver (adh8a, adh5, aldh2.1 and aldh2.2). Our results showed marked differences in the mortality rate of zebrafish larvae depending on the time of day of the exposure to 5% ethanol for 1h (82% and 6% mortality in the morning and at night, respectively). A significant daily rhythm was detected with the acrophase located at ""zeitgeber"" time (ZT) = 04:22 h. Behavioural tests exposing zebrafish to 1% ethanol provoked a major decrease in swimming activity (68-84.2% reduction) at ZT2, ZT6 and ZT10. In contrast, exposure at ZT18 stimulated swimming activity (27% increase). During the day fish moved towards the bottom of the tank during ethanol exposure, whereas at night zebrafish increased their activity levels right after the exposure to ethanol. Genes involved in ethanol detoxification failed to show significant daily rhythms in LD, although all of them exhibited circadian regulation in constant darkness (DD) with acrophases in phase and located at the end of the subjective night. Taken altogether, this research revealed the importance of considering the time of day when designing and carrying out toxicological and behavioural tests to investigate the effects of ethanol, as the adverse effects of this drug were more marked when fish were exposed in the morning than at night."

The fermentation process of “yamahai-ginjo-shikomi” sake is mainly performed by three microbes, Aspergillus oryzae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Lactobacilli; the levels of various metabolites fluctuate during the fermentation of sake. For evaluation of the fermentation process, we monitored the concentration of moderate-sized molecules (m/z: 200–1000) dynamically changed during the fermentation process of “yamahai-ginjo-shikomi” Japanese sake. This analysis revealed that six compounds were the main factors with characteristic differences in the fermentation process. Among the six compounds, four were leucine- or isoleucine-containing peptides and the remaining two were predicted to be small molecules. Quantification of these compounds revealed that their quantities changed during the month of fermentation process. Our metabolomic approach revealed the dynamic changes observed in moderate-sized molecules during the fermentation process of sake, and the factors found in this analysis will be candidate molecules that indicate the progress of “yamahai-ginjo-shikomi” sake fermentation."
https://openalex.org/W2781634885,"Background Intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) is part of a multi-pronged strategy aimed at preventing malaria in pregnancy in areas of moderate to high transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite being formally adopted as a malaria prevention policy over a decade ago, IPTp coverage has remained low. Recent demands for action have incorporated calls to strengthen IPTp monitoring and evaluation systems, including the use of routine data, to measure coverage, track implementation and identify roadblocks to improving uptake. Concerns about the quality of malaria indicators reported through routine information systems are well recognized, but there are few data on the realities of IPTp recording practices in frontline facilities or their entry into District Health Information Software (DHIS2). Methods Drawing on fieldwork conducted in two malaria endemic sub-counties in Kenya, we explore how local adaptations and innovations employed by health workers and sub-country managers to cope with a range of health system constraints, shape recording practices and in turn, the measurement of IPTp. Data were collected through observations, interviews, and document reviews. Data analysis and interpretation was guided by thematic analysis approach. Results Measurement of IPTp was undermined by health system constraints such as stock-out of drugs and human resource shortages. Coping strategies adopted by health workers to address these challenges ensured continuity in service delivery and IPTp data generation but had variable consequences on IPTp data quality. Unclear recording and reporting instructions also led to lack of standardization in IPTp data generation. The use of redundant tools created significant data burdens which undermined service delivery in general. Conclusions There is need to integrate monthly reporting forms so as to remove redundancies which exacerbates workload for health workers and disrupts service delivery. Similarly, data collection instructions in registers and reporting forms need to be clarified to standardize IPTp data generation across health facilities. There is also need to address broader contextual factors such as stock-out of commodities and human resource shortages which undermine IPTp data generation process."
https://openalex.org/W2782015327,"Despite El Niño events being one of the main forces shaping the coastal desert vegetation in South America, the impacts of the high precipitation typical of this rare but recurrent climatic event remain understudied. Here we monitored the plant community of a coastal lomas, a seasonal desert ecosystem, during 1998 and 2001 to analyse its changes during the 1997–98 El Niño and the following La Niña events. We measured species abundance and vegetation cover in 31 plots, and recorded climate variables in Lomas de Lachay, Peru. We found a significant positive correlation between precipitation and vegetation cover, density, alpha diversity (species diversity at the plot level), total richness and abundance of several key species but no correlation with gamma diversity (species diversity at the whole loma level). During the El Niño event, the seasonality, typical of the lomas ecosystem, disappeared, as evidenced by both the similarity of species composition and mean vegetation cover values between most sampling campaigns of 1998 and 1999. Moreover, total richness was lower during the El Niño event than during the humid season of 2000 and 2001 resulting from the dominance of only a few species, such as Nicotiana paniculata and Loasa urens. Temporal-spatial changes in the abundance of the dominant species caused the differences between alpha and gamma diversity, especially during 1999. Within that year, mean alpha diversity showed similar values whilst gamma diversity values were different. The reestablishment of the seasonality of most plant community characteristics and a clear difference between species composition of the humid and the dry season occurred two years after the El Niño event, suggesting a resilient community. This study provides one of the few quantifications of the Peruvian lomas’ response to the 1997–98 El Niño event and the following La Niña, one of the most extreme climatic events in the last century."
https://openalex.org/W2781647224,"For decades, ecologists have debated the importance of biotic interactions (e.g., competition) and abiotic factors in regulating populations. Competition can influence patterns of distribution, abundance, and resource use in many systems but remains difficult to measure. We quantified competition between two sympatric small mammals, Keen's mice (Peromyscus keeni) and dusky shrews (Sorex monticolus), in four habitat types on Prince of Wales Island in Southeast Alaska. We related shrew density to that of mice using standardized regression models while accounting for habitat variables in each year from 2010-2012, during which mice populations peaked (2011) and then crashed (2012). Additionally, we measured dietary overlap and segregation using stable isotope analysis and kernel utilization densities and estimated the change in whole community energy consumption among years. We observed an increase in densities of dusky shrews after mice populations crashed in 2012 as expected under competitive release. In addition, competition coefficients revealed that the influence of Keen's mice was dependent on their density. Also in 2012, shrew diets shifted, indicating that they were able to exploit resources previously used by mice. Nonetheless, increases in shrew numbers only partially compensated for the community energy consumption because, as insectivores, they are unlikely to utilize all food types consumed by their competitors. In pre-commercially thinned stands, which exhibit higher diversity of resources compared to other habitat types, shrew populations were less affected by changes in mice densities. These spatially and temporally variable interactions between unlikely competitors, observed in a relatively simple, high-latitude island ecosystem, highlight the difficulty in assessing the role of biotic factors in structuring communities."
https://openalex.org/W2781569632,"Background No study of obesity risk for people in developed countries has conducted a multi-dimensional analysis of the association of socioeconomic status with obesity. In this paper, we investigated if education functions as either a confounder or an effect modifier in the association of another socioeconomic status indicator with obesity. Methods This cross-sectional study analyzed data of an adult population sample (10,905 men and 14,580 women) from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2010–2014). The study performed multivariate logistic regression analyses for three education levels and four indicators of socioeconomic status (i.e., marital status, residential area, occupation, and income). Results The overall prevalence of obesity was 38.1% in men and 29.1% in women (p < 0.001). In men, while education functioned as an effect modifier in the association between marital status and obesity (p for interaction = 0.006), it functioned as both a confounder (p < 0.001) and an effect modifier (p for interaction < 0.001) in the association between residential area and obesity. In contrast, in women, education functioned as a confounder in the association of residential area with obesity (p = 0.010). However, it functioned as both a confounder (p < 0.001) and an effect modifier (p for interaction = 0.012) in the association between income and obesity. A prediction showed that unlike in women, education was positively associated with obesity risk for some socioeconomic indicator groups in men; for example, in a rural resident group, a higher level of education increased the probability of being obese by 19.7%. Conclusions The present study suggests the need to examine sex-specific studies regarding the role of education on the association between other socioeconomic status indicators and obesity. This should be considered in planning education policies to reduce the risk of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2782382073,"Previous studies with gene-deficient mice (ADAMTS5-P) revealed that ADAMTS5 (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin type 1 motifs, member 5) plays a functional role in adiposity and metabolic health. To confirm these observations, we have performed similar studies with an independently generated strain of ADAMTS5 deficient mice (ADAMTS5-J). Upon cold exposure as well as after high-fat diet feeding (diet-induced obesity or DIO model), these knockout (KO) mice developed less subcutaneous and gonadal white adipose tissue (WAT) as compared to their wild-type (WT) littermates (reduction was more pronounced in ADAMTS5-P mice). Enhanced browning of WAT, as monitored by expression of UCP-1 was seen in the ADAMTS5-J KO mice upon cold exposure but not in the DIO model (seen in both conditions with the ADAMTS5-P mice). Brown adipose tissue (BAT) mass was not different between KO and WT ADAMTS5-J mice, either upon cold exposure or in the DIO model (in contrast to the enhanced BAT mass with the ADAMTS5-P mice). Energy expenditure and thermogenesis were not significantly different between KO and WT ADAMTS5-J mice (in contrast to somewhat enhanced levels in ADAMTS5-P mice). Insulin sensitivity was improved in the ADAMTS5-J KO mice, and they were protected against non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in the DIO model (as the ADAMTS5-P mice). These data are thus similar for both strains of KO mice, confirming specificity of the phenotype, but some quantitative and qualitative differences are also observed."
https://openalex.org/W2781990467,"All ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs) undergo an activation process before their conjugation to target proteins. Although the steps required for the activation of UBLs are conserved and common to all UBLs, we have previously shown that the activation of the UBL, ubiquitin fold modifier 1 (UFM1) by the E1, Ufm1 modifier-activating enzyme 5 (UBA5) is executed in a trans-binding mechanism, not observed in any other E1. In this study, we explored the necessity of that mechanism for UFM1 activation and found that it is needed not only for UFM1 binding to UBA5 but also for stabilizing the UBA5 homodimer. Although UBA5 functions as a dimer, in solution it behaves as a weak dimer. Dimerization of UBA5 is required for ATP binding; therefore, stabilization of the dimer by UFM1 enhances ATP binding. Our results make a connection between the binding of UFM1 to UBA5 and the latter's affinity to ATP, so we propose a novel mechanism for the regulation of ATP's binding to E1.-Mashahreh, B., Hassouna, F., Soudah, N., Cohen-Kfir, E., Strulovich, R., Haitin, Y., Wiener, R.

https://openalex.org/W2781869620,"Rice is one of the main food crops and several studies have examined the molecular mechanism of the exposure of the rice plant stigma. The improvement in the exposure of the stigma in female parent hybrid combinations can enhance the efficiency of hybrid breeding. In the present study, a mutant plant with low exposed stigma (lesr) was discovered among the descendants of the indica thermo-sensitive sterile line 115S. The ES% rate of the mutant decreased by 70.64% compared with the wild type variety. The F2 population was established by genetic analysis considering the mutant as the female parent and the restorer line 93S as the male parent. The results indicated a normal F1 population, while a clear division was noted for the high and low exposed stigma groups, respectively. This process was possible only by a ES of 25% in the F2 population. This was in agreement with the ratio of 3:1, which indicated that the mutant was controlled by a recessive main-effect QTL locus, temporarily named as LESR. Genome-wide comparison of the SNP profiles between the early, high and low production bulks were constructed from F2 plants using bulked segregant analysis in combination with high-throughput sequencing technology. The results demonstrated that the candidate loci was located on the chromosome 10 of the rice. Following screening of the recombinant rice plants with newly developed molecular markers, the genetic region was narrowed down to 0.25 Mb. This region was flanked by InDel-2 and InDel-2 at the physical location from 13.69 to 13.94 Mb. Within this region, 7 genes indicated base differences between parents. A total of 2 genes exhibited differences at the coding region and upstream of the coding region, respectively. The present study aimed to further clone the LESR gene, verify its function and identify the stigma variation."
https://openalex.org/W2781770497,"Nothosaurs form a subclade of the secondarily marine Sauropterygia that was well represented in late Early to early Late Triassic marine ecosystems. Here we present and discuss the internal skull anatomy of the small piscivorous nothosaur Nothosaurus marchicus from coastal to shallow marine Lower Muschelkalk deposits (Anisian) of Winterswijk, The Netherlands, which represents the oldest sauropterygian endocast visualized to date. The cranial endocast is only partially encapsulated by ossified braincase elements. Cranial flattening and lateral constriction by hypertrophied temporal musculature grant the brain a straight, tubular geometry that lacks particularly well-developed cerebral lobes but does potentially involve distinguishable optic lobes, suggesting vision may have represented an important sense during life. Despite large orbit size, the circuitous muscular pathway linking the basisphenoidal and orbital regions indicates poor oculomotor performance. This suggests a rather fixed ocular orientation, although eye placement and neck manoeuvrability could have enabled binocular if not stereoscopic vision. The proportionally large dorsal projection of the braincase endocast towards the well-developed pineal foramen advocates substantial dependence on the corresponding pineal system in vivo. Structures corroborating keen olfactory or acoustic senses were not identified. The likely atrophied vomeronasal organ argues against the presence of a forked tongue in Nothosaurus, and the relative positioning of external and internal nares contrasts respiratory configurations proposed for pistosauroid sauropterygians. The antorbital domain furthermore accommodates a putative rostral sensory plexus and pronounced lateral nasal glands that were likely exapted as salt glands. Previously proposed nothosaurian 'foramina eustachii' arose from architectural constraints on braincase development rather than representing functional foramina. Several modifications to brain shape and accessory organs were achieved through heterochronic development of the cranium, particularly the braincase. In summary, the cranium of Nothosaurus marchicus reflects important physiological and neurosensory adaptations that enabled the group's explosive invasion of shallow marine habitats in the late Early Triassic."
https://openalex.org/W2782271596,"The Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) procedure was used to compare waste management options for kraft pulp mill sludge following its anaerobic digestion. Anaerobic digestion of sludge is advantageous because it produces biogas that may be used to generate electricity, heat and biofuels. However, adequate management of the digested sludge is essential. Landfill disposal is a non-sustainable waste management alternative. Kraft pulp mill digested sludge applied to land may pose risks to the environment and public health if the sludge has not been properly treated. This study is aimed to compare several recycling alternatives for anaerobically digested sludge from kraft pulp mills: land application, landfill disposal, composting, incineration, pyrolysis/gasification, and biofuel production by algae. The MCDA procedure considered nine criteria into three domains to compare digested sludge recycling alternatives in a kraft pulp mill: environmental (CO2 emission, exposure to pathogens, risk of pollution, material and energy recovery), economic (overall costs, value of products) and technical (maintenance and operation, feasibility of implementation). The most suitable management options for digested sludge from kraft pulp mills were found to be composting and incineration (when the latter was coupled with recycling ash to the cement industry). Landfill disposal was the worst option, presenting low performance in feasibility of implementation, risk of pollution, material and energy recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2782333787,"To describe Norwegian adults with congenital unilateral upper limb deficiency (CUULD) regarding self-reported chronic pain (intensity, locations, impact on daily life) and fatigue. Analyze associations between chronic pain and demographic/clinical factors and associations between fatigue and demographic/ clinical factors.Cross-sectional study. In 2012, a postal questionnaire was sent to 186 persons with congenital limb deficiency, age ≥ 20 years. Seventy seven persons with CUULD responded and are included in this paper. The questionnaire included questions on demographic and clinical factors, chronic pain (Brief Pain Inventory, Standardized Nordic Questionnaire) and fatigue (Fatigue severity scale (FSS)).Mean age was 42.7 (SD 16.0), 71% were women. Sixty tree % reported chronic pain, many had bilateral pain, most common pain locations were neck (78%) and shoulder/upper arm (78%). However, reported mean pain intensity (3.3 (SD 2.8)) and mean number of pain locations (3.0 (SD 2.5)) were moderate to low. Thirty seven persons reported that pain started in adult age (≥ 19 years). One third reported severe fatigue (FSS ≥ 5). Persons reporting cold sensitivity and severe fatigue were most likely to have chronic pain.Congenital upper limb deficiency increases the risk of self-reported pain in neck, shoulder/upper arm, cold sensitivity and severe fatigue. Pain, fatigue and cold sensitivity may individually affect function, and may together reinforce functional problems. This should be to taken into account when rehabilitation programs are developed. Further studies of more representative samples should be conducted to confirm our findings."

Despite the importance, little is known about its mechanism of action at the molecular level. Here, we report the crystal structure of NLRP12 PYD domain at 1.70 Å fused with an maltose-binding protein (MBP) tag. Interestingly, the PYD domain forms a dimeric configuration through a disulfide bond in the crystal. The possible biological significance is discussed in the context of ROS induced NF-κB activation."
https://openalex.org/W2781633995,"PKnox1 (also known as Prep1) belongs to the TALE family of homeodomain transcription factors that are critical for regulating growth and differentiation during embryonic and postnatal development in vertebrates. We demonstrate here that PKnox1 is required for adult spermatogenesis in a germ cell-intrinsic manner. Tamoxifen-mediated PKnox1 loss in the adult testes, as well as its germ cell-specific ablation, causes testis hypotrophy with germ cell apoptosis and, as a consequence, compromised spermatogenesis. In PKnox1-deficient testes, spermatogenesis was arrested at the c-Kit+ spermatogonia stage, with a complete loss of the meiotic spermatocytes, and was accompanied by compromised differentiation of the c-Kit+ spermatogonia. Taken together, these results indicate that PKnox1 is a critical regulator of maintenance and subsequent differentiation of the c-Kit+ stage of spermatogonia in the adult testes."

The role of economic evaluation in healthcare is increasing and this research provides decision-makers with new information about the management of Clostridium difficile infection, from an economic perspective.A model-based economic evaluation was undertaken to identify the most cost-effective healthcare intervention relating to the reduction of Clostridium difficile transmission. Efficacy evidence was synthesised from the literature and was used to inform the effectiveness of both bundled approaches and stand-alone interventions, where appropriate intervention combinations were coupled together. Changes in health outcomes were estimated by combining information about intervention effectiveness and its subsequent impact on quality of life.A bundled approach of improving hand hygiene and environmental cleaning produces the best combination of increased health benefits and cost-savings. It has the highest mean net monetary benefit when compared to all other interventions. This intervention remains the optimal decision under different clinical circumstances, such as when mortality rate and patient length of stay are increased. Bundled interventions offered the best opportunity for health improvements.These findings provide healthcare decision-makers with novel information about the allocation of scarce resources relating to Clostridium difficile. If investments are not made in interventions that clearly yield gains in health outcomes, the allocation and use of scarce healthcare resources is inappropriate and improvements in health outcomes will be forgone."
https://openalex.org/W2781891517,"Dengue virus (DENV) is one of the most widespread arboviruses. The four DENV serotypes infect about 400 million people every year, causing 96 million clinical dengue cases, of which approximately 500'000 are severe and potentially life-threatening. The only licensed vaccine has a limited efficacy and is only recommended in regions with high endemicity. We previously reported that 2'-O-methyltransferase mutations in DENV-1 and DENV-2 block their capacity to inhibit type I IFNs and render the viruses attenuated in vivo, making them amenable as vaccine strains; here we apply this strategy to all four DENV serotypes to generate a tetravalent, non-chimeric live-attenuated dengue vaccine. 2'-O-methyltransferase mutants of all four serotypes are highly sensitive to type I IFN inhibition in human cells. The tetravalent formulation is attenuated and immunogenic in mice and cynomolgus macaques and elicits a response that protects from virus challenge. These results show the potential of 2'-O-methyltransferase mutant viruses as a safe, tetravalent, non-chimeric dengue vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2782002984,"Experience is well known to affect sensory-guided behaviors in many herbivorous insects. Here, we investigated the effects of natural feeding experiences of Helicoverpa armigera larvae on subsequent preferences of larval approaching and feeding, as well as the effect of host-contacting experiences of mated females on subsequent ovipositional preference. The results show that the extent of experience-induced preference, expressed by statistical analysis, depended on the plant species paired with the experienced host plant. Larval feeding preference was much easier to be induced by natural feeding experience than larval approaching preference. Naïve larvae, reared on artificial diet, exhibited clear host-ranking order as follows: tobacco ≥ cotton > tomato > hot pepper. Feeding experiences on hot pepper and tobacco could always induce positive feeding preference, while those on cotton often induced negative effect, suggesting that the direction of host plant experience-induced preference is not related to innate feeding preference. Inexperienced female adults ranked tobacco as the most preferred ovipositional host plant, and this innate preference could be masked or weakened but could not be reversed by host-contacting experience after emergence."
https://openalex.org/W2782393234,"NANOG plays a pivotal role in pluripotency acquisition and lineage specification in higher vertebrates, and its expression is restricted to primordial germ cells (PGCs) during early embryonic development. Mammalian NANOG self-associates via conserved tryptophan-repeat motifs in the C-terminal domain (CTD) to maintain pluripotency. Avian NANOG, however, lacks the conserved motifs, and the molecular mechanism underlying the biologic function is not clearly understood. Here, using spectroscopic and biochemical methods as well as cell-based assays, we report that chicken NANOG (cNANOG) oligomerizes through its CTD via a novel folding-upon-binding mechanism. The CTD of cNANOG is disordered as a monomer and associates into an α-helical multimer driven by intermolecular hydrophobic interactions. Mutation of key aromatic residues in the CTD abrogates the self-association, leading to a loss of the proliferation of chicken PGCs and blastoderm cells. Our results demonstrate that the CTD of cNANOG belongs to a novel IDP that switches into a helical oligomer via self-association, enabling the maintenance of PGCs and blastoderm cells.—Choi, H. J., Kim, I., Lee, H. J., Park, Y. H., Suh, J.-Y., Han, J. Y. Chicken NANOG self-associates via a novel folding-upon-binding mechanism. FASEB J. 32,2563–2573 (2018). www.fasebj.org"
https://openalex.org/W2781826615,"Pulmonary hypertension is a severe, incurable disease with a poor prognosis. Although treatment regimens have improved during the last 2 decades, current pharmacologic strategies are limited and focus on the modulation of only a few pathways related to endothelin, NO, and prostacyclin signaling. Therefore, the identification of novel molecular targets is urgently needed. We found that the β2 adrenoceptor (AR) agonists terbutaline (TER) and salbutamol induced a dose-dependent vasorelaxation in large pulmonary arteries but not aortas of mouse. This effect was found to be independent of b ARs and the endothelium but was determined by the type of the preconstrictor. Vasodilation by β2 AR agonists occurred after pretreatment of pulmonary arteries with phenylephrine and serotonin, both agonists of a 1 ARs, but was absent after preconstriction with the thromboxane analog U46619. These data indicated a-adrenolytic activity of β2 AR agonists, which was confirmed by a right shift of the phenylephrine dose-response curve by TER. This effect was physiologically relevant because TER also relaxed small intrapulmonary arteries in lung slices and diminished pulmonary arterial pressure in an isolated perfused lung model under normoxia and hypoxia. Finally, TER applied as an aerosol also selectively decreased pulmonary arterial pressure without effects on systemic blood pressure and heart rate in mouse in vivo. Thus, β2 AR agonists display a-adrenolytic activity in pulmonary arteries ex vivo and in vivo, and may provide a novel option to reduce pulmonary arterial pressure in pulmonary hypertension.—Neumann, V., Knies, R., Seidinger, A., Simon, A., Lorenz, K., Matthey, M., Breuer, J., Wenzel, D.

https://openalex.org/W2782027596,"When a short flash occurs in spatial alignment with a moving object, the moving object is seen ahead the stationary one. Similar to this visual ""flash-lag effect"" (FLE) it has been recently observed for the haptic sense that participants judge a moving hand to be ahead a stationary hand when judged at the moment of a short vibration (""haptic flash"") that is applied when the two hands are spatially aligned. We further investigated the haptic FLE. First, we compared participants' performance in two isosensory visual or haptic conditions, in which moving object and flash were presented only in a single modality (visual: sphere and short color change, haptic: hand and vibration), and two bisensory conditions, in which the moving object was presented in both modalities (hand aligned with visible sphere), but the flash was presented only visually or only haptically. The experiment aimed to disentangle contributions of the flash's and the objects' modalities to the FLEs in haptics versus vision. We observed a FLE when the flash was visually displayed, both when the moving object was visual and visuo-haptic. Because the position of a visual flash, but not of an analogue haptic flash, is misjudged relative to a same visuo-haptic moving object, the difference between visual and haptic conditions can be fully attributed to characteristics of the flash. The second experiment confirmed that a haptic FLE can be observed depending on flash characteristics: the FLE increases with decreasing intensity of the flash (slightly modulated by flash duration), which had been previously observed for vision. These findings underline the high relevance of flash characteristics in different senses, and thus fit well with the temporal-sampling framework, where the flash triggers a high-level, supra-modal process of position judgement, the time point of which further depends on the processing time of the flash."
https://openalex.org/W2781728793,"Most of our knowledge of wild chimpanzee behaviour stems from fewer than 10 long-term field sites. This bias limits studies to a potentially unrepresentative set of communities known to show great behavioural diversity on small geographic scales. Here, we introduce a new genetic approach to bridge the gap between behavioural material evidence in unhabituated chimpanzees and genetic advances in the field of primatology. The use of DNA analyses has revolutionised archaeological and primatological fields, whereby extraction of DNA from non-invasively collected samples allows researchers to reconstruct behaviour without ever directly observing individuals. We used commercially available forensic DNA kits to show that termite-fishing by wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) leaves behind detectable chimpanzee DNA evidence on tools. We then quantified the recovered DNA, compared the yield to that from faecal samples, and performed an initial assessment of mitochondrial and microsatellite markers to identify individuals. From 49 termite-fishing tools from the Issa Valley research site in western Tanzania, we recovered an average of 52 pg/μl chimpanzee DNA, compared to 376.2 pg/μl in faecal DNA extracts. Mitochondrial DNA haplotypes could be assigned to 41 of 49 tools (84%). Twenty-six tool DNA extracts yielded >25 pg/μl DNA and were selected for microsatellite analyses; genotypes were determined with confidence for 18 tools. These tools were used by a minimum of 11 individuals across the study period and termite mounds. These results demonstrate the utility of bio-molecular techniques and a primate archaeology approach in non-invasive monitoring and behavioural reconstruction of unhabituated primate populations."
