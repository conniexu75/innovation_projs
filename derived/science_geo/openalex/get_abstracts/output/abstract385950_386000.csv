Typhimurium) causes acute gut inflammation by using its virulence factors to invade the intestinal epithelium and survive in mucosal macrophages. The inflammatory response enhances the transmission success of S. Typhimurium by promoting its outgrowth in the gut lumen through unknown mechanisms. Here we show that reactive oxygen species generated during inflammation react with endogenous, luminal sulphur compounds (thiosulphate) to form a new respiratory electron acceptor, tetrathionate. The genes conferring the ability to use tetrathionate as an electron acceptor produce a growth advantage for S. Typhimurium over the competing microbiota in the lumen of the inflamed gut. We conclude that S. Typhimurium virulence factors induce host-driven production of a new electron acceptor that allows the pathogen to use respiration to compete with fermenting gut microbes. Thus the ability to trigger intestinal inflammation is crucial for the biology of this diarrhoeal pathogen. The ability of the enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium to use tetrathionate as a terminal electron acceptor has been used in the laboratory as a convenient means of enriching growth media containing this bacterium for many years. Tetrathionate respiration was thought to have little importance during infection, but to come into its own in free-living bacteria in environments containing tetrathionate, such as soil or decomposing carcasses. Now a possible role has been identified for this metabolism during intestinal infection. Acute intestinal inflammation induced by S. enterica Typhimurium virulence factors is shown to be accompanied by production of oxygen radicals in the gut lumen as part of the immune response. These oxygen radicals oxidize thiosulphate, the end product of hydrogen-sulphide detoxification by enterocytes, to tetrathionate. The pathogen can then use tetrathionate respiration during growth in the inflamed intestine, allowing it to out-compete other microbes that rely on anaerobic fermentation. Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium causes acute gut inflammation, which promotes the growth of the pathogen through unknown mechanisms. It is now shown that the reactive oxygen species generated during inflammation react with host-derived sulphur compounds to produce tetrathionate, which the pathogen uses as a terminal electron acceptor to support its growth. The ability to use tetrathionate provides the pathogen with a competitive advantage over bacteria that lack this property."

https://openalex.org/W2156636923,"Plasmodium falciparum is the most prevalent and lethal of the malaria parasites infecting humans, yet the origin and evolutionary history of this important pathogen remain controversial. Here we develop a single-genome amplification strategy to identify and characterize Plasmodium spp. DNA sequences in faecal samples from wild-living apes. Among nearly 3,000 specimens collected from field sites throughout central Africa, we found Plasmodium infection in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and western gorillas (Gorilla gorilla), but not in eastern gorillas (Gorilla beringei) or bonobos (Pan paniscus). Ape plasmodial infections were highly prevalent, widely distributed and almost always made up of mixed parasite species. Analysis of more than 1,100 mitochondrial, apicoplast and nuclear gene sequences from chimpanzees and gorillas revealed that 99% grouped within one of six host-specific lineages representing distinct Plasmodium species within the subgenus Laverania. One of these from western gorillas comprised parasites that were nearly identical to P. falciparum. In phylogenetic analyses of full-length mitochondrial sequences, human P. falciparum formed a monophyletic lineage within the gorilla parasite radiation. These findings indicate that P. falciparum is of gorilla origin and not of chimpanzee, bonobo or ancient human origin."

https://openalex.org/W1969766619,"Apicomplexan parasites replicate by varied and unusual processes where the typically eukaryotic expansion of cellular components and chromosome cycle are coordinated with the biosynthesis of parasite-specific structures essential for transmission.Here we describe the global cell cycle transcriptome of the tachyzoite stage of Toxoplasma gondii. In dividing tachyzoites, more than a third of the mRNAs exhibit significant cyclical profiles whose timing correlates with biosynthetic events that unfold during daughter parasite formation. These 2,833 mRNAs have a bimodal organization with peak expression occurring in one of two transcriptional waves that are bounded by the transition into S phase and cell cycle exit following cytokinesis. The G1-subtranscriptome is enriched for genes required for basal biosynthetic and metabolic functions, similar to most eukaryotes, while the S/M-subtranscriptome is characterized by the uniquely apicomplexan requirements of parasite maturation, development of specialized organelles, and egress of infectious daughter cells. Two dozen AP2 transcription factors form a series through the tachyzoite cycle with successive sharp peaks of protein expression in the same timeframes as their mRNA patterns, indicating that the mechanisms responsible for the timing of protein delivery might be mediated by AP2 domains with different promoter recognition specificities.Underlying each of the major events in apicomplexan cell cycles, and many more subordinate actions, are dynamic changes in parasite gene expression. The mechanisms responsible for cyclical gene expression timing are likely crucial to the efficiency of parasite replication and may provide new avenues for interfering with parasite growth."

The CusCBA system is responsible for extruding biocidal Cu(I) and Ag(I) ions from the cell. The X-ray crystal structure of CusA, the inner membrane transporter, has now been determined in the absence and presence of bound Cu(I) or Ag(I). The structures suggest that the metal binding site, formed by a three-methionine cluster, is located within the cleft region of the periplasmic domain. The authors propose a potential pathway for ion export in which CusA is capable of picking up the metal ion from the cytosol, with this transporter utilizing the methionine pairs and clusters to bind and export metal ions. Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, use tripartite efflux complexes in the resistance-nodulation-cell division family to expel toxic compounds from the cell. The CusCBA system is responsible for removing biocidal Cu(I) and Ag(I) ions. Here, the X-ray crystal structure is reported of CusA in the absence and presence of bound Cu(I) or Ag(I). The structures reveal that the metal-binding sites are located within the cleft region of the periplasmic domain. A potential pathway for ion export is proposed. Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, frequently use tripartite efflux complexes in the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND) family to expel various toxic compounds from the cell1,2. The efflux system CusCBA is responsible for extruding biocidal Cu(I) and Ag(I) ions3,4. No previous structural information was available for the heavy-metal efflux (HME) subfamily of the RND efflux pumps. Here we describe the crystal structures of the inner-membrane transporter CusA in the absence and presence of bound Cu(I) or Ag(I). These CusA structures provide new structural information about the HME subfamily of RND efflux pumps. The structures suggest that the metal-binding sites, formed by a three-methionine cluster, are located within the cleft region of the periplasmic domain. This cleft is closed in the apo-CusA form but open in the CusA-Cu(I) and CusA-Ag(I) structures, which directly suggests a plausible pathway for ion export. Binding of Cu(I) and Ag(I) triggers significant conformational changes in both the periplasmic and transmembrane domains. The crystal structure indicates that CusA has, in addition to the three-methionine metal-binding site, four methionine pairs—three located in the transmembrane region and one in the periplasmic domain. Genetic analysis and transport assays suggest that CusA is capable of actively picking up metal ions from the cytosol, using these methionine pairs or clusters to bind and export metal ions. These structures suggest a stepwise shuttle mechanism for transport between these sites."
https://openalex.org/W2011396983,"Two classes of kinases, CDK and DDK, facilitate the initiation of DNA replication in S phase. In two studies, the Diffley and Toczyski labs show that when damage is sensed, another kinase — the checkpoint kinase Rad53 — halts replication by inhibiting both the CDK and DDK pathways through the phosphorylation of Sld3 and Dbf4, respectively. These results reveal that regulation of the firing of origins is the means by which the intra-S checkpoint slows S phase. Two classes of enzyme — cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) and Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK) — facilitate the initiation of DNA replication in eukaryotes. It is now shown that, when DNA damage is sensed, another kinase, Rad53, halts the firing of late replication origins by inhibiting both the CDK and the DDK pathways. Rad53 acts on DDK directly by inhibiting Dbf4, whereas the CDK pathway is blocked by Rad53-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream CDK substrate Sld3. Origins of replication are activated throughout the S phase of the cell cycle such that some origins fire early and others fire late to ensure that each chromosome is completely replicated in a timely fashion. However, in response to DNA damage or replication fork stalling, eukaryotic cells block activation of unfired origins. Human cells derived from patients with ataxia telangiectasia are deficient in this process due to the lack of a functional ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase and elicit radioresistant DNA synthesis1,2,3 after γ-irradiation2. This effect is conserved in budding yeast, as yeast cells lacking the related kinase Mec1 (ATM and Rad3-related (ATR in humans)) also fail to inhibit DNA synthesis in the presence of DNA damage4. This intra-S-phase checkpoint actively regulates DNA synthesis by inhibiting the firing of late replicating origins, and this inhibition requires both Mec1 and the downstream checkpoint kinase Rad53 (Chk2 in humans)5,6. However, the Rad53 substrate(s) whose phosphorylation is required to mediate this function has remained unknown. Here we show that the replication initiation protein Sld3 is phosphorylated by Rad53, and that this phosphorylation, along with phosphorylation of the Cdc7 kinase regulatory subunit Dbf4, blocks late origin firing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Upon exposure to DNA-damaging agents, cells expressing non-phosphorylatable alleles of SLD3 and DBF4 (SLD3-m25 and dbf4-m25, respectively) proceed through the S phase faster than wild-type cells by inappropriately firing late origins of replication. SLD3-m25 dbf4-m25 cells grow poorly in the presence of the replication inhibitor hydroxyurea and accumulate multiple Rad52 foci. Moreover, SLD3-m25 dbf4-m25 cells are delayed in recovering from transient blocks to replication and subsequently arrest at the DNA damage checkpoint. These data indicate that the intra-S-phase checkpoint functions to block late origin firing in adverse conditions to prevent genomic instability and maximize cell survival."

We found a subset of medium spiny neurons coexpressing D1 and D2 receptors in varying densities throughout the basal ganglia, with the highest incidence in nucleus accumbens and globus pallidus and the lowest incidence in caudate putamen. These receptors formed D1-D2 receptor heteromers that were localized to cell bodies and presynaptic terminals.

There is controversy as to the colocalization of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors (D1R, D2R) within these two neuronal subtypes. It is generally agreed that whereas D1R is largely segregated to the DYN/substance P-expressing direct striatonigral pathway, D2R is predominantly localized to the ENK-expressing indirect striatopallidal pathway, which is supported by recent studies using fluorophore-tagged promoter elements of D1R and D2R in bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice to quantify the cells expressing the receptors within these pathways (3Bertran-Gonzalez J.

This indicated a certain fraction of NAc MSNs expressed both receptors, a finding consistent with numerous studies showing colocalization of D1R and D2R in a proportion of striatal neurons (7Aubert I.

However, despite growing evidence that neurons coexpressing D1R and D2R embody a significant fraction of MSNs in NAc, their regional distribution, phenotypic characterization, and functional role within basal ganglia are entirely unknown. Given the apparent relationship between dopamine receptor expression and DYN or ENK content, we hypothesized that neurons expressing the D1-D2 heteromer would contain both DYN and ENK, and, accordingly, these neurons would not show preferential localization to either the direct striatonigral or indirect striatopallidal pathways. Given the pervasive role of intracellular calcium signaling in all aspects of neuronal function, we hypothesized that activation of the D1-D2 heteromer would influence neuronal transmission and behavioral output, whereas the activity of the heteromer would respond to alterations in dopamine transmission, such as induced by drugs of abuse or in schizophrenia. Seventy-five adult male Sprague-Dawley rats and 20 adult gene-deleted (D1R−/− or D5R−/−) or control mice were used. Animals were housed and tested in compliance with the guidelines described in the Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals (Canadian Council on Animal Care). The behavioral testing environment was a noncolony room containing 16 clear polycarbonate activity monitors (20 × 20 × 45 cm3). An array of six infrared photocells was attached outside the longer sides of the cages. The photocells were spaced 7.5-cm apart and 2-cm above the floor of the cage. SKF 83959 hydrobromide and SKF 83822 hydrobromide (Tocris Bioscience) were dissolved in physiological saline containing 5% dimethyl sulfoxide and administered subcutaneously. Raclopride (Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in saline and administered intraperitoneally. For non-drug injections, an equivalent volume of saline was administered. All drug injections were administered at a volume of 1.0 ml/kg. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (9Lee S.P. So C.H. Rashid A.J. Varghese G. Cheng R. Lança A.J.

Free-floating sections were incubated with primary antibodies (1:200) for 60 h at 4 °C (D1R (rabbit) from Sigma-Aldrich; D2R (rat), ENK (mouse), and synaptophysin (mouse, SYN) from Chemicon; DYN (guinea pig) from Neuromics; post-synaptic density 95 (mouse, PSD95) from Abcam). Specificity of the dopamine receptor antibodies for the D1R and D2R have been tested previously (9Lee S.P. So C.H. Rashid A.J. Varghese G. Cheng R. Lança A.J. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. J. Biol.

Additional controls were performed in the absence of the primary or secondary antibodies. Antibody dilutions were also used to identify the optimal working concentrations. To minimize background and prevent cross-excitation of the secondary antibody-linked fluorophores (Alexa Fluor, Invitrogen), only three primary antibodies were used on the tissue at any given time. Images were obtained using an Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope at 63× magnification. Lower magnification images (40×) were obtained for the purpose of cell counting. Cell counting was performed using 300 μm2 regions. FRET acceptor bleaching was performed sections from rat brain incubated for 24 h at 4 °C with primary antibodies to D1 and D2 receptors, and the species-specific secondary antibodies were conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 350 dyes. Small regions of interest of the acceptor, D1-Alexa Fluor 488, were exposed to high intensity (90%) bleaching using an argon laser at 488 nm. Prebleach and postbleach images were sequentially acquired with an Olympus Fluoview FV 1000 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 60×/1.4 numeric aperture objective. The anti-D2-Alexa Fluor 350 was excited with a krypton laser at 405 nm, whereas the anti-D1-Alexa Fluor 488 was excited with an argon laser at 488 nm. The emissions were collected at appropriate emission bands 430/20 nm and 530/20 nm, respectively. Low laser intensities (<2%) were used to avoid acquisition bleaching. The percentage increase of the donor intensity post-bleaching (Dpost) was compared with the donor intensity pre-bleaching (Dpre) and represents the efficiency of FRET (designated as E), which was calculated according to the equation, E = 100 × ((Dpost − Dpre)/Dpre). Quantitative confocal microscopy FRET was performed as described previously (12Hasbi A. Fan T. Alijaniaram M. Nguyen T. Perreault M.L. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21377-21382Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Behavioral analysis was conducted daily for 7 days. On each day of testing, animals were administered SKF 83959 or SKF 83822 (both 0.4 mg/kg subcutaneously) and placed immediately inside the activity chamber. Their locomotor and grooming activity was then monitored for 60 min. The measurement of grooming behavior followed a previously described protocol (14Culver K.E. Rosenfeld J.M. Szechtman H. Psychopharmacology. 2000; 151: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The grooming of the animals was scored for 30 s every 6–7 min, for a total of 4 min (2 min sampled from the first 30 min of testing and 2 min sampled from the last 30 min of testing). Immediately following behavioral testing on the final day (day 7), animals were decapitated, and brains were rapidly removed. NAc and CP tissues were dissected, flash frozen, and immediately stored at −80 °C until use in immunoblotting. To assess the effects of raclopride on grooming responses to SKF 83959, animals were administered injections of SKF 83959 once daily for 3 days, and grooming behavior was monitored for 60 min following drug administration. On the third day of testing, animals were injected with raclopride (0.5 mg/kg intraperitoneal) 10 min prior to SKF 83959. Tissues from the NAc and CP were retrieved from animals that underwent the 7-day treatment protocol and suspended in cell lysis buffer, and 15–30 μg of protein were incubated in sample buffer for 3 min at 95 °C. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel and electroblotted on a PVDF transfer membrane for 2.5 h. Membranes were blocked and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle shaking with primary antibody to calcium/calmodulin kinase IIα (CaMKII) (1:1000, rabbit, Cell Signaling), to phosphorylated CaMKII-Thr286 (1:5000, mouse, Affinity Bioreagents), to GluR1 (1:2000), phospho-GluR1-Ser845 (1:2000), and phospho-GluR1-Ser831 (1:2000, rabbit, Chemicon). Membranes were then washed in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with secondary antibody (Bio-Rad). Antibody labeling of proteins were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences), and signal intensity was quantified using Zeiss AxioVision4 software. Binding experiments were performed on 50 μg of rat striatal protein or 25–35 μg of the P2 fraction human globus pallidus with 1–2 nm [3H]raclopride in the presence of agonist as described (13Rashid A.J.

Post-mortem human tissues were generously donated by the Canadian Brain Tissue Bank (Toronto Western Hospital) and by Dr. W. W. Tourtellotte, J. S. Riehl, and D. Kamrava of the National Neurological Research Bank. Samples were from patients of similar ages. Three of the four schizophrenia patients had received antipsychotic treatment, whereas the remaining patient was neuroleptic-naive. The incorporation of [35S]GTPγS was measured as described previously (15Seeman P. Guan H.C. Synapse. 2008; 62: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Specificity of the dopamine receptor antibodies for the D1R and D2R were tested using the five dopamine receptors (D1–D5) expressed individually in HEK293 cells (9Lee S.P. So C.H. Rashid A.J.

Testing was also performed in striatal tissue of D1R or D2R gene-deleted mice where we showed no reactivity of the D1R or D2R antibody, respectively (Fig. 1A). When the primary D1R and D2R and associated secondary antibodies were combined, no cross-excitation of the secondary fluorophores was evident (Fig. 1B). Additional images depicting antibody specificity are shown in the NAc shell (Fig. 1C). Controls were also performed in the absence of the primary or secondary antibodies to exclude cross-reactivity. An example of quantitative confocal FRET analysis (12Hasbi A. Fan T. Alijaniaram M. Nguyen T. Perreault M.L. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Oxford University Press, New York2005: 126-145Google Scholar) designed to remove both the donor and acceptor spectral bleed-through signals and to correct for variation in fluorophore expression level associated with FRET imaging. As shown in both neonatal striatal neurons and NAc core (Fig. 1, D and E), the FRET signal was absent unless both the donor and acceptor were present. It was observed that the cell bodies of some neurons in NAc coexpressed D1R and D2R (Fig. 2, A and B), and these neurons also coexpressed DYN or ENK (white arrows). In contrast, MSNs that expressed solely the D1R (yellow arrows) or D2R expressed DYN or ENK, respectively. D2R-only expressing neurons, lacking ENK, were also evident and were likely indicative of a cholinergic neuronal population. Coexpression of DYN and ENK was also observed in NAc, and some of these neurons also expressed the D1R or the D2R (core, 62.6 ± 3.9%; shell, 79.0 ± 3.6%; n = 20 sections) (Fig. 2, C and D). However, although DYN/ENK coexpressing neurons could exist in the absence of the D1R or D2R, 100% of D1R and D2R coexpression occurred in the presence of DYN or ENK. Taken together, these findings indicated that D1/D2 coexpression was confined to a unique population of neurons expressing both neuropeptides. DYN/ENK neurons were also identified in CP (Fig. 3), some of which also expressed the D1R and D2R (8.0 ± 1.4%, n = 20 sections). D1/D2-DYN/ENK neurons were also found in varying quantities in ventral pallidum, GP, and entopeduncular nucleus (supplemental Fig. S2).FIGURE 3Colocalization of the D1 and D2 receptor with dynorphin and enkephalin in rat caudate putamen.

The fraction of D1R-expressing neurons that contained D2R showed substantial inter-regional variation (Fig. 4A, left panel), ranging from ∼7–60%, although the density of D1/D2 coexpressing neurons did not appear to coincide with the number of D1R-expressing cells (Fig. 4A, right panel) nor with their anatomical localization to regions within the striatonigral or striatopallidal pathways. The highest density of D1R-expressing neurons was found in CP (109.8 ± 3.6 neurons/300 μm2, n = 25 sections), although this region also exhibited the lowest proportion of neurons coexpressing the D2R (6.8 ± 0.4%). Conversely, the lowest levels of D1R-expressing neurons were found in GP (11.6 ± 0.6 neurons/300 μm2, n = 25 sections), with the highest proportion of D2R coexpression (59.0 ± 3.1%). D1R expression was also observed in the other basal ganglia nuclei and mesolimbic structures, including both NAc subregions, and we showed that a significant proportion of these NAc neurons coexpressed the D2R (core: 24.6 ± 2.1%, shell: 33.8 ± 4.4%). In the NAc core, shell, and in CP, the number of D2R-expressing cells (core, 24.2 ± 2.6; shell, 29.1 ± 2.0; CP, 105.1 ± 4.4 neurons/300 μm2; n = 16–25 sections) was marginally lower than D1R-expressing cells with the proportion of D2R neurons coexpressing D1R being ∼27%, ∼36, and ∼7%, respectively. We have shown by coimmunoprecipitation from striatum that D1R and D2R exist within an oligomeric complex (9Lee S.P. So C.H. Rashid A.J. Varghese G. Cheng R. Lança A.J. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. J.

To directly demonstrate the presence of the D1-D2 heteromer in situ, we used two confocal FRET methodologies that used specific antibodies tagged to endogenously expressed D1R or D2R. Preliminary experiments were conducted in NAc core using acceptor photobleaching, a method based on the fact that the specific photo-destruction of the acceptor (D1-Alexa Fluor 488) would lead to an increase in the donor (D2-Alexa Fluor 350) fluorescence if both D1R and D2R were in close proximity. When compared, prebleaching and postbleaching images of the same neuronal subregion showed that although the fluorescence of the acceptor (D1-Alexa Fluor 488) decreased to a low 6.6% of the original intensity, which represented a decrease of 93.3 ± 5.0%, the fluorescence of the donor (D2-Alexa Fluor 350) increased by 21.1 ± 3.0%. This indicated that the two receptors were in close proximity, allowing FRET to occur between the fluorophores linked to antibodies recognizing the D1R and D2R, with an apparent high FRET efficiency of 21.1 ± 3.0%. To further quantify the parameters indicating the interaction between D1R and D2R within D1-D2 heteromers, notably the corrected FRET, the calculated FRET efficiency, and the distance separating both receptors, we used a second quantitative confocal FRET methodology. This methodology was applied to striatal sections in situ (Fig. 4, B–E). In neurons coexpressing both receptors, relative receptor expression levels were evaluated by assessing the fluorophore intensities of labeled D1R and D2R (Fig. 4B). There was equal expression of D1R and D2R in NAc core and shell neuronal cell bodies and reduced expression of D1R relative to D2R in CP cell bodies. In cell bodies of neurons in the NAc core (Fig. 4C), shell, and CP, high magnification revealed that receptor colocalization was not evenly dispersed but was more punctate, and FRET measurements were obtained from multiple microdomains, or regions of interest, within each neuron as indicated by the circles (Fig. 4C). The FRET efficiency and distance provided was an average number based on hundreds of individual regions of interest. Each region of interest was between 0.8–1 μm in diameter with a confocal tomographic section thickness of 2.27 μm. In both NAc subregions, D1R and D2R interactions displayed similarly high FRET efficiency (∼20%) (Fig. 4D), and the receptor antibody-linked fluorophores were calculated to be in close proximity with a relative distance of 5–7 nm (50–70 Å), indicative of D1-D2 heteromer formation. In contrast, FRET efficiency was significantly lower in CP (∼5%) with a relative distance of 8–9 nm (80–90 Å) between the receptors also indicative of D1-D2 heteromer formation but suggestive of weaker receptor interactions, fewer heteromers, and/or the presence of lower order oligomers. Additionally, we determined that, in the cell bodies of neurons coexpressing D1R and D2R in NAc, the majority exhibited heteromer formation (∼91%), whereas in CP, a smaller proportion of D1R- and D2R-coexpressing neurons (∼24%) formed the D1-D2 receptor complex (Fig. 4E). To discern the distribution of D1R and D2R in the neuronal projection areas, we assessed synaptic localization of the complex by coimmunostaining with the presynaptic marker SYN (or PSD95) (Fig. 5). In the NAc core and shell (Fig. 5, A and B), individual D1R or D2R was found at either pre- or postsynaptic sites as evidenced by colocalization with either SYN (Fig. 5, A and B, top rows) or PSD95 (Fig. 4, A and B, bottom rows) (yellow circles, D1R; purple color overlay, D2R), although the distribution of D2R expression was more diffuse. In contrast, colocalization of D1R and D2R was consistently visualized selectively with SYN on presynaptic terminals both opposing neuronal cell bodies and within the neuropil (white circles) and did not appear to exhibit anatomical overlap with PSD95 (white circles). These colocalized presynaptic D1R and D2R existed as D1-D2 heteromers as determined by quantitative FRET with FRET efficiencies (core, 0.17 ± 0.01; shell, 0.19 ± 0.01 region of interest/region; n = 45–55) (supplemental Fig. S3) being slightly lower than that observed in the NAc cell bodies (Fig. 4D). Likewise in CP, D1R and D2R coexpression was observed solely with SYN (Fig. 5C), and these receptors also formed D1-D2 heteromers. However, unlike that observed in CP cell bodies, the FRET efficiency within the neuropil of this region was relatively high (0.14 ± 0.01, n = 48) indicating that the synaptic D1-D2 heteromers may play a more predominant physiological role in this region. D1R and D2R colocalization with SYN, but not PSD95, was additionally observed in ventral pallidum and GP (supplemental Fig. S4). However, in VTA (Fig. 5D), SN compacta and SN reticulata (supplemental Fig. S4), unambiguous instances of D1R and D2R colocalization in the neuropil were scarce, and colocalization of both receptors with SYN or PSD95 was not observed. Conversely, individual D1R or D2R were colocalized with either marker in this region, demonstrating both the pre- and postsynaptic localization of these receptors in MSNs. This scarcity of synaptic D1R and D2R colocalization in SN and VTA was not due to a lack of DYN-ENK projections to these regions as projections from striatum to SN/VTA that co-contain substance P and ENK (17Wang H.B. Laverghetta A.V. Foehring R. Deng Y.P. Sun Z. Yamamoto K. Lei W.L. Jiao Y. Reiner A. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2006; 31: 178-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or D1R and D2R (18Deng Y.P. Lei W.L. Reiner A. J. Chem. Neuroanat. 2006; 32: 101-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have been documented. A more plausible explanation is that dopamine receptor trafficking to the dendrites exhibits region-dependent specificity. That is, although D1R and D2R may be coexpressed in cell bodies of neurons within a given brain region, it cannot be inferred that the two receptors would concurrently coexist in their distal dendrites. This suggests that the functional properties of cell body versus dendritic D1-D2 heteromers may differ, with the physiological properties of synaptic D1-D2 heteromers not being required in the SN or VTA. Nonetheless, despite the absence of synaptic D1-D2 heteromers in some regions, our neuro-anatomical evidence suggests that there exists a significant sub-circuitry of D1-D2/DYN-ENK MSNs that interconnect the basal ganglia nuclei and likely also form intraregional synaptic connections between MSNs, in addition to the classical D1R striatonigral and D2R striatopallidal projections. Given the presence of the D1-D2 heteromer in basal ganglia, the effects of selective D1-D2 heteromer activation on locomotion and grooming were examined by treatment with SKF 83959, a drug we have previously shown to selectively activate the D1-D2 heteromer-induced calcium signal without activating D1R or D2R homo-oligomers (13Rashid A.J. So C.H. Kong M.M. Furtak T. El-Ghundi M. Cheng R. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Activation of the D1-D2 heteromer by SKF 83959 significantly increased the amount of time rats spent grooming, whereas SKF 83822, a drug that activates only D1R homo-oligomers, attenuated grooming (mean across injections, 26.0 ± 2.2 s versus 4.5 ± 0.8 s; drug effect, F(2,21) = 35.0, p < 0.0001, Fig. 6A). These drug-induced changes in grooming remained relatively consistent across the drug injection regimen as evidenced by the lack of an injection effect (F(6,126) = 0.9, p = 0.47) or a drug x injection interaction (F(12,126) = 0.7, p = 0.78). Antagonism of either receptor within the heteromer has been shown to attenuate D1-D2 heteromer-induced signaling (9Lee S.P. So C.H. Rashid A.J. Varghese G. Cheng R. Lança A.J. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 654-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), and an acute injection of the D2R antagonist raclopride greatly attenuated, but did not eliminate, grooming in both SKF 83959-treated rats and controls (Fig. 6C). As SKF 83959 does not activate D2R homo-oligomers, inhibition of SKF 83959-induced grooming by raclopride indicates that this behavior is in large part induced by the D1-D2 heteromer. However, it is important to note that the D5 receptor may have also contributed to SKF 83959-induced grooming as the drug additionally exhibits high affinity (19Neumeyer J.L. Kula N.S. Bergman J. Baldessarini R.J. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 474: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and acts as an agonist at this receptor (12Hasbi A. Fan T. Alijaniaram M. Nguyen T. Perreault M.L. O'Dowd B.F. George S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21377-21382Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although grooming induced by SKF 83959 would not involve D2R homo-oligomer activation, the antagonist raclopride does invariably target D2Rs. As raclopride alone significantly reduced grooming, a role for D2R homo-oligomers in mediating this behavior cannot be equivocally excluded. SKF 83959 or SKF 83822 both stimulated locomotion (Fig. 6B), though the magnitude of the responses differed (drug effect, F(2,21) = 12.6, p < 0.0001) as did the time course (supplemental Fig. S5). Effects of repeated D1-D2 heteromer activation by SKF 83959 on CaMKII levels and activity revealed a significant reduction in total CaMKII expression in NAc, but not CP, and no changes"

A first lineage was retrieved in all teleosts, while a second CXCL8 lineage was found in zebrafish and carp only. An early inflammatory function for both lineages was indicated by several lines of evidence. The induction of carp CXCL8s, CXCb, and CXC receptor-1 and -2 was analyzed after in vitro stimulation of leukocyte subpopulations and in two in vivo inflammation models. Recombinant proteins of carp CXCL8 proteins were produced and showed significant chemotactic activity for carp leukocytes.While both carp CXCL8s appear to be functional homologs of mammalian CXCL8, their different induction requirements and kinetics evoke a gene-specific sub-functionalization."
https://openalex.org/W2092623477,"Chelatable zinc is important in brain function, and its homeostasis is maintained to prevent cytotoxic overload. However, certain pathologic events result in intracellular zinc accumulation in lysosomes and mitochondria. Abnormal lysosomes and mitochondria are common features of the human lysosomal storage disorder known as mucolipidosis IV (MLIV). MLIV is caused by the loss of TRPML1 ion channel function. MLIV cells develop large hyperacidic lysosomes, membranous vacuoles, mitochondrial fragmentation, and autophagic dysfunction. Here, we observed that RNA interference of mucolipin-1 gene (TRPML1) in HEK-293 cells mimics the MLIV cell phenotype consisting of large lysosomes and membranous vacuoles that accumulate chelatable zinc. To show that abnormal chelatable zinc levels are indeed correlated with MLIV pathology, we quantified its concentration in cultured MLIV patient fibroblast and control cells with a spectrofluorometer using N-(6-methoxy-8-quinolyl)-p-toluene sulfonamide fluorochrome. We found a significant increase of chelatable zinc levels in MLIV cells but not in control cells. Furthermore, we quantified various metal isotopes in whole brain tissue of TRPML1(-/-) null mice and wild-type littermates using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and observed that the zinc-66 isotope is markedly elevated in the brain of TRPML1(-/-) mice when compared with controls. In conclusion, we show for the first time that the loss of TRPML1 function results in intracellular chelatable zinc dyshomeostasis. We propose that chelatable zinc accumulation in large lysosomes and membranous vacuoles may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease and progressive cell degeneration in MLIV patients."

Based on the 13 genome sequences, we have identified the C. jejuni pan-genome, as well as the core genome, the auxiliary genes, and genes unique between strains M1 and 81116. The pan-genome contains 2,427 gene families, whilst the core genome comprised 1,295 gene families, or about two-thirds of the gene content of the average of the sequenced C. jejuni genomes. Various comparison and visualization tools were applied to the 13 C. jejuni genome sequences, including a species pan- and core genome plot, a BLAST Matrix and a BLAST Atlas. Trees based on 16S rRNA sequences and on the total gene families in each genome are presented. The findings are discussed in the background of the proven virulence potential of M1."

Enriched Müller cells in vitro or those that re-enter cell cycle in response to neurotoxin-damage to retina in vivo display multipotential and self-renewing capacities, the cardinal features of stem cells.We demonstrate that Notch and Wnt signaling activate Müller cells through their canonical pathways and that a rare subset of activated Müller cells differentiates along rod photoreceptor lineage in the outer nuclear layer. The differentiation of activated Müller cells along photoreceptor lineage is confirmed by multiple approaches that included Hoechst dye efflux analysis, genetic analysis using retina from Nrl-GFP mice, and lineage tracing using GS-GFP lentivirus in wild type and rd mice in vitro and S334ter rats in vivo. Examination of S334ter rats for head-neck tracking of visual stimuli, a behavioral measure of light perception, demonstrates a significant improvement in light perception in animals treated to activate Müller cells. The number of activated Müller cells with rod photoreceptor phenotype in treated animals correlates with the improvement in their light perception.In summary, our results provide a proof of principle for non-neurotoxin-mediated activation of Müller cells through Notch and Wnt signaling toward the regeneration of rod photoreceptors."
https://openalex.org/W1973570510,"Alterations in the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP) are believed to play a central role in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. Burgeoning data indicate that APP is proteolytically processed in endosomal-autophagic-lysosomal compartments. In this study, we used both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> paradigms to determine whether alterations in macroautophagy affect APP metabolism. Three mouse models of glycosphingolipid storage diseases, namely Niemann-Pick type C1, GM1 gangliosidosis, and Sandhoff disease, had mTOR-independent increases in the autophagic vacuole (AV)-associated protein, LC3-II, indicative of impaired lysosomal flux. APP C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) were also increased in brains of the three mouse models; however, discrepancies between LC3-II and APP-CTFs were seen between primary (GM1 gangliosidosis and Sandhoff disease) and secondary (Niemann-Pick type C1) lysosomal storage models. APP-CTFs were proportionately higher than LC3-II in cerebellar regions of GM1 gangliosidosis and Sandhoff disease, although LC3-II increased before APP-CTFs in brains of NPC1 mice. Endogenous murine Aβ40 from RIPA-soluble extracts was increased in brains of all three mice. The <i>in vivo</i> relationship between AV and APP-CTF accumulation was also seen in cultured neurons treated with agents that impair primary (chloroquine and leupeptin + pepstatin) and secondary (U18666A and vinblastine) lysosomal flux. However, Aβ secretion was unaffected by agents that induced autophagy (rapamycin) or impaired AV clearance, and LC3-II-positive AVs predominantly co-localized with degradative LAMP-1-positive lysosomes. These data suggest that neuronal macroautophagy does not directly regulate APP metabolism but highlights the important anti-amyloidogenic role of lysosomal proteolysis in post-secretase APP-CTF catabolism."

Here we study the process of transient and global synchronization using a simple model of phase-coupled oscillators assigned to cortical areas in the cerebral cat cortex. Our results highlight the impact of the topological connectivity in the developing of synchronization, revealing a transition in the synchronization organization that goes from a modular decentralized coherence to a centralized synchronized regime controlled by a few cortical areas forming a Rich-Club connectivity pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2051056168,"We have shown that Rpl3, a protein of the large ribosomal subunit from baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), is stoichiometrically monomethylated at position 243, producing a 3-methylhistidine residue. This conclusion is supported by top-down and bottom-up mass spectrometry of Rpl3, as well as by biochemical analysis of Rpl3 radiolabeled in vivo with S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-(3)H]methionine. The results show that a +14-Da modification occurs within the GTKKLPRKTHRGLRKVAC sequence of Rpl3. Using high-resolution cation-exchange chromatography and thin layer chromatography, we demonstrate that neither lysine nor arginine residues are methylated and that a 3-methylhistidine residue is present. Analysis of 37 deletion strains of known and putative methyltransferases revealed that only the deletion of the YIL110W gene, encoding a seven β-strand methyltransferase, results in the loss of the +14-Da modification of Rpl3. We suggest that YIL110W encodes a protein histidine methyltransferase responsible for the modification of Rpl3 and potentially other yeast proteins, and now designate it Hpm1 (Histidine protein methyltransferase 1). Deletion of the YIL110W/HPM1 gene results in numerous phenotypes including some that may result from abnormal interactions between Rpl3 and the 25 S ribosomal RNA. This is the first report of a methylated histidine residue in yeast cells, and the first example of a gene required for protein histidine methylation in nature."

Consistent with this scenario, in cell and mouse models of HD, misfolded species of mutant htt in a diffuse fraction impair cellular machinery before fibrils accumulate (8Bennett E.J. Shaler T.A.

Thus, the misfolding of disease proteins to a similar oligomeric conformation might contribute to their toxicity. The molecular mechanism for this misfolding is not clear, but A11 seems to recognize a structural motif that is exposed only in oligomers and not in the native structure, random coil monomers, or mature fibrils (13Glabe C.G.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 9104-9114Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).The molecular mechanism invoked by Hsp70 and Hsp40 in protein folding is well established. These chaperones regulate folding in a cooperative manner driven by Hsp70-dependent ATP hydrolysis, thereby promoting substrate refolding and preventing unspecific protein interactions that otherwise would lead to aggregation (21Erbse A. Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Young J.C. Agashe V.R. Siegers K. Hartl F.U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which these chaperones influence protein misfolding in HD and other neurodegenerative diseases is not completely clear. For example, it is not known whether Hsp70 and Hsp40 interact with soluble oligomeric forms of misfolded proteins or whether they use a similar ATP-dependent mechanism to refold reactive sequences exposed on oligomers. In earlier studies, Hsp70 and Hsp40 inhibited the formation of SDS-insoluble aggregates of mutant htt fragments by presumably acting on small, misfolded species that were structurally uncharacterized (15Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 23Schaffar G. Breuer P. Boteva R.

A subsequent study showed that Hsp70 and Hsp40 inhibited the formation of spherical and annular mutant htt oligomers, as shown by atomic force microscopy (AFM), but presumably by partitioning of mutant htt monomers (7Wacker J.L. Zareie M.H. Fong H. Sarikaya M. Muchowski P.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In animal models of polyQ expansion disorders, overexpression of Hsp70 and Hsp40 reduces pathogenesis without altering the accumulation or size of inclusion bodies, but increases the detergent solubility of the misfolded polyQ proteins (16Warrick J.M. Chan H.Y. Gray-Board G.L. Chai Y. Paulson H.L. Bonini N.M. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 18Cummings C.J. Sun Y. Opal P. Antalffy B. Mestril R. Orr H.T. Dillmann W.H. Zoghbi H.Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1511-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Conversely, increased pathogenesis in the absence of Hsp70 in a mouse model of HD is associated with larger inclusion bodies without changes in the level of detergent-insoluble, fibrillar aggregates (7Wacker J.L. Zareie M.H. Fong H. Sarikaya M. Muchowski P.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Thus, chaperones such as Hsp70 and Hsp40 may mediate neuroprotection by acting on soluble monomeric and oligomeric species rather than insoluble fibrillar species.In this study, we show that mutant htt forms soluble oligomers that are highly heterogeneous in size, some of which react with the conformation-specific antibody A11. We also found that Hsp70 suppresses the formation of A11-reactive species by interacting with them in a classic ATP-dependent reaction cycle that requires Hsp40 (DNAJB1). These results support the hypothesis that subsets of soluble mutant htt oligomers mediate pathogenesis in HD.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we show that a mutant htt fragment with an expanded polyQ repeat formed soluble oligomers of 60–600 kDa in vitro and in cells. These oligomers were fractionated readily by SEC, and a subset of them displayed an epitope recognized by the anti-oligomer antibody A11. In addition, the molecular chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp40 acted cooperatively in an ATP-dependent manner to interact with mutant htt oligomers and interfere with their formation.Soluble mutant htt oligomers resolved by SEC displayed differential reactivity to a panel of monoclonal antibodies, suggesting that they are misfolded into discrete higher order structures in which specific epitopes are exposed, buried, or absent. Reactivity to some antibodies also changed with incubation time in vitro and in PC12 cells. Thus, soluble mutant htt oligomers appear to be highly dynamic and heterogeneous structures, consistent with recent AFM analyses (2Legleiter J. Mitchell E. Lotz G.P. Sapp E. Ng C. DiFiglia M. Thompson L.M. Muchowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14777-14790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In our recent studies, monoclonal antibodies that recognize expanded polyQ repeats had diverse effects on the aggregation of monomeric mutant htt (1Legleiter J. Lotz G.P. Miller J. Ko J. Ng C. Williams G.L. Finkbeiner S. Patterson P.H. Muchowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 21647-21658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This finding suggested that the polyQ repeat in mutant htt monomers also samples different conformations that can be discriminated readily by antibodies. Compelling support for this hypothesis came from a study in which x-ray crystallography showed that the polyQ repeat in a wild-type htt fragment stably adopts multiple independent secondary structures, including random coil and α-helix (38Kim M.W. Chelliah Y. Kim S.W. Otwinowski Z. Bezprozvanny I. Structure. 2009; 17: 1205-1212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 39Miller J. Rutenber E. Muchowski P.J. Structure. 2009; 17: 1151-1153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In line with these studies, one attractive hypothesis is that it is the chameleon-like nature of mutant htt that results in the numerous abnormal protein-interactions that mediate pathogenesis in HD. However, some subsets of misfolded mutant htt conformations might be more chemically reactive/toxic than others, depending on their secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures. Consistent with this hypothesis, here we showed that soluble mutant htt oligomers of ∼272–545 kDa, but not smaller oligomers, react with the conformation-specific antibody A11, which neutralizes the toxicity of oligomers formed by synthetic polyQ peptides (12Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3405) Google Scholar).Molecular chaperones (e.g. Hsp70 and Hsp40) ensure that proteins fold properly and prevent them from misfolding and are thus potent suppressors of polyQ toxicity in vivo (16Warrick J.M. Chan H.Y. Gray-Board G.L. Chai Y. Paulson H.L. Bonini N.M. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 18Cummings C.J. Sun Y. Opal P. Antalffy B. Mestril R. Orr H.T. Dillmann W.H. Zoghbi H.Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1511-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms by which they suppress the toxicity of mutant htt are not clear. Our previous studies suggested that Hsp70 and Hsp40 attenuate oligomer formation by partitioning monomers (7Wacker J.L. Zareie M.H. Fong H. Sarikaya M. Muchowski P.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Here we showed that these chaperones also associate directly and dynamically with soluble mutant htt oligomers. Importantly, these chaperones had variable affinities for different subsets of oligomers. Hsp70 and Hsp40 were completely absent from some SEC fractions that contained mutant htt oligomers and were most strongly associated with oligomers in fractions that also showed A11 reactivity. Moreover, when overexpressed in PC12 cells expressing a toxic mutant htt fragment, Hsp70 and Hsp40 suppressed the formation of A11-reactive oligomers but not other mutant htt oligomers coincident with suppression of caspase 3 activation. In yeast and mammalian cells, the chaperonin TRiC suppresses mutant htt aggregation and toxicity (40Kitamura A. Kubota H. Pack C.G. Matsumoto G. Hirayama S. Takahashi Y. Kimura H. Kinjo M. Morimoto R.I. Nagata K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1163-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 41Tam S. Geller R. Spiess C. Frydman J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1155-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). An independent study in yeast showed that TRiC interacts synergistically with Hsp70/Hsp40 to modulate the formation of A11-reactive oligomers by mutant htt (24Behrends C. Langer C.A. Boteva R. Böttcher U.M. Stemp M.J. Schaffar G. Rao B.V. Giese A. Kretzschmar H. Siegers K. Hartl F.U. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 887-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 41Tam S.

Although confirmation of these studies in more physiologically relevant models of HD is needed, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that soluble A11-reactive mutant htt oligomers might be a pathogenic conformer that is recognized by these chaperones.Hsp70 and Hsp40 suppressed mutant htt aggregation far more efficiently then either chaperone alone, as reported (15Muchowski P.J. Schaffar G. Sittler A. Wanker E.E. Hayer-Hartl M.K. Hartl F.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 7841-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 16Warrick J.M. Chan H.Y. Gray-Board G.L.

Genet. 2000; 9: 2009-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). However, we demonstrated that Hsp70 alone does not interact with soluble oligomers. Rather, the interaction of Hsp70 with mutant htt oligomers was mediated entirely by Hsp40 (DNAJB1), which is required for productive folding of model substrates by Hsp70 (26Minami Y. Höhfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 42Freeman B.C. Morimoto R.I.

Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). In these reactions, Hsp40 (the more abundant protein) stabilizes the substrate in a conformation suitable for interaction with Hsp70, which then transiently interacts with the substrate in a manner that allows it to reach a folding- or degradation-competent state (43Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2766) Google Scholar, 44Mayer M.P. Bukau B. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 670-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar). Importantly, just as with model substrates, ATP was required for the interaction between Hsp70/Hsp40 and soluble mutant htt oligomers. Given the conformational flexibility exhibited in mutant htt monomers, it is tempting to speculate that Hsp40 recognizes an unfolded/misfolded motif in mutant htt exposed on the surface of soluble oligomers and that Hsp70 refolds this sequence in an ATP-dependent manner to a nontoxic fold, thus converting a toxic oligomer to one that is benign (Fig. 7). Consistent with our results, a recent study showed in mammalian cells that DNAJB members of the Hsp40 family might play a central role in early recognition and binding of polyQ protein aggregates (36Hageman J. Rujano M.A. van Waarde M.A. Kakkar V. Dirks R.P. Govorukhina N. Oosterveld-Hut H.M. Lubsen N.H. Kampinga H.H. Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 355-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar).We propose a model of how Hsp70 and Hsp40 modulate mutant htt misfolding in HD (Fig. 7). Expansion of the polyQ repeat in mutant htt causes misfolding and formation of different subsets of intermediate species (monomers and oligomers), some of which adopt toxic conformations recognized by Hsp40 that are presented to Hsp70 (Fig. 7A). Hsp40 would then stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70, resulting in the formation of a high affinity ADP·Hsp70·mutant htt oligomer complex (Fig. 7, B and C). Although not addressed in this study, it is likely that nucleotide exchange factors are responsible for ATP replacement and release of benign mutant htt conformations that can either be degraded or transferred to other chaperone systems (Fig. 7D).One perplexing feature of HD and other polyQ disorders is their relatively late age of onset. Molecular chaperones and other factors with important roles in proteostasis (45Balch W.E. Morimoto R.I. Dillin A. Kelly J.W. Science. 2008; 319: 916-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar) appear to robustly cope with the burden of mutant htt misfolding for decades but clearly become overwhelmed as a function of age. Because the activities of most molecular chaperones and the proteasome are strictly ATP-dependent, the late onset of HD might reflect, in part, pronounced deficits in ATP production in HD patients (46Browne S.E. Beal M.F. Neurochem. Res. 2004; 29: 531-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Therefore, in a symptomatic state in HD, decreased ATP levels would lead to a decrease in productive interactions between Hsp70 and substrates and would increase the concentration of ADP-bound Hsp70 (closed state), causing it to become trapped in complexes with misfolded mutant htt conformations or other Hsp70 substrates that would lead to Hsp70 aggregation/sequestration with mutant htt aggregates. Consistent with such a model, Hsp70 coaggregates with α-synuclein in the presence of ADP (47Roodveldt C. Bertoncini C.W. Andersson A. van der Goot A.T. Hsu S.T. Fernández-Montesinos R. de Jong J. van Ham T.J. Nollen E.A. Pozo D. Christodoulou J. Dobson C.M. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 3758-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Moreover, when combined with impairment of the protein degradation systems that is thought to occur in HD and related disorders, decreased chaperone function would lead to an overwhelming increase of toxic mutant htt species and cell death. In parallel, the accumulation of benign mutant htt aggregates (such as amorphous and fibrillar structures) under these conditions may initially represent a cellular coping response to prevent an increase of toxic oligomers. It is also important to note that under these conditions, all of the normal functions of chaperones in protein folding and other cellular processes are likely to become profoundly impaired (48Gidalevitz T. Ben-Zvi A. Ho K.H. Brignull H.R. Morimoto R.I. Science. 2006; 311: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar).In summary, we provide the first direct evidence that Hsp70 and Hsp40 functionally interact with subsets of soluble mutant htt oligomers that may play a pathogenic role in HD. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of chaperone functions in mutant htt misfolding may provide insights that will catalyze the development of novel strategies to combat this and other devastating neurodegenerative diseases. IntroductionThe accumulation of aggregated mutant htt in cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusion bodies in neurons is a pathological hallmark of HD. 4The abbreviations used are: HDHuntington diseasepolyQpolyglutamineAFMatomic force microscopySECsize exclusion chromatographyEGFPenhanced GFP. Recent studies suggest that mutant htt is a highly dynamic protein that adopts multiple misfolded monomeric and higher order conformations that exist in a dynamic equilibrium (1Legleiter J. Lotz G.P.

Which of these structures, if any, mediate toxic gain-of-function protein interactions that cause neuronal dysfunction and cell death in HD is not well understood.The assembly of mutant htt into amyloid-like fibrils was initially thought to be causally associated with the pathogenesis of HD (3Davies S.W. Turmaine M. Cozens B.A. DiFiglia M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A. Scherzinger E. Wanker E.E. Mangiarini L. Bates G.P.

More recent studies indicate that mutant htt and other disease-associated proteins with polyglutamine (polyQ) expansions also exist as smaller oligomers that have spherical, annular, and protofibrillar morphologies (5Poirier M.A. Li H.

Consistent with this scenario, in cell and mouse models of HD, misfolded species of mutant htt in a diffuse fraction impair cellular machinery before fibrils accumulate (8Bennett E.J. Shaler T.A.

Neurosci. 2010; 30: 3675-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In a cellular model of HD, the survival rate of cells is greater in the presence of inclusion bodies that contain fibrils than in their absence (11Arrasate M. Mitra S. Schweitzer E.S. Segal M.R. Finkbeiner S. Nature. 2004; 431: 805-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). Importantly, mutant htt fragments and synthetic polyQ peptides form oligomers in a polyQ length-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo, consistent with a causative role for these structures in HD pathogenesis (2Legleiter J. Mitchell E. Lotz G.P. Sapp E. Ng C. DiFiglia M. Thompson L.M. Muchowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14777-14790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, oligomers are also highly heterogeneous in size, stability, and solubility (2Legleiter J. Mitchell E. Lotz G.P. Sapp E. Ng C. DiFiglia M. Thompson L.M. Muchowski P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 14777-14790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Therefore, only subsets of such structures might be most biologically active.Many disease-causing proteins form toxic oligomers that react in a conformation-dependent manner with A11, an antibody that neutralizes their toxicity in cell-based assays (12Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3405) Google Scholar). Thus, the misfolding of disease proteins to a similar oligomeric conformation might contribute to their toxicity. The molecular mechanism for this misfolding is not clear, but A11 seems to recognize a structural motif that is exposed only in oligomers and not in the native structure, random coil monomers, or mature fibrils (13Glabe C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29639-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar).Molecular chaperones, which are sequestered in inclusion bodies, suppress neurodegeneration in several animal models of protein misfolding diseases, including HD (14Muchowski P.J.

Chaperones are thought to suppress the toxicity of disease-associated proteins, at least in part, through direct effects on their misfolding, but the mechanisms are not well understood. Hsp70 and Hsp40 are major cytosolic molecular chaperones that, if overexpressed, suppress neurodegeneration in animal models of polyQ diseases (16Warrick J.M. Chan H.Y. Gray-Board G.L. Chai Y.

A public-private partnership with the Ministry of Health, CDC, Vestergaard Frandsen and CHF International implemented a one-week integrated multi-disease prevention campaign.Residents of Lurambi, Western Kenya were eligible for participation. The aim was to offer services to at least 80% of those aged 15-49. 31 temporary sites in strategically dispersed locations offered: HIV counseling and testing, 60 male condoms, an insecticide-treated bednet, a household water filter for women or an individual filter for men, and for those testing positive, a 3-month supply of cotrimoxazole and referral for follow-up care and treatment.Over 7 days, 47,311 people attended the campaign with a 96% uptake of the multi-disease preventive package. Of these, 99.7% were tested for HIV (87% in the target 15-49 age group); 80% had previously never tested. 4% of those tested were positive, 61% were women (5% of women and 3% of men), 6% had median CD4 counts of 541 cell/µL (IQR; 356, 754). 386 certified counselors attended to an average 17 participants per day, consistent with recommended national figures for mass campaigns. Among women, HIV infection varied by age, and was more likely with an ended marriage (e.g. widowed vs. never married, OR.3.91; 95% CI. 2.87-5.34), and lack of occupation. In men, quantitatively stronger relationships were found (e.g. widowed vs. never married, OR.7.0; 95% CI. 3.5-13.9). Always using condoms with a non-steady partner was more common among HIV-infected women participants who knew their status compared to those who did not (OR.5.4 95% CI. 2.3-12.8).Through integrated campaigns it is feasible to efficiently cover large proportions of eligible adults in rural underserved communities with multiple disease preventive services simultaneously achieving various national and international health development goals."

Co-expression of kinase and InhA alters the growth dynamics of Mycobacterium smegmatis, suggesting that InhA phosphorylation in vivo is an important event in regulating its activity. An InhA-T266E mutant, which mimics constitutive phosphorylation, is unable to rescue an M. smegmatis conditional inhA gene replacement mutant, emphasizing the critical role of Thr-266 in mediating post-translational regulation of InhA activity. The involvement of various serine/threonine kinases in modulating the activity of a number of enzymes of the mycolic acid synthesis pathway, including InhA, accentuates the intricacies of mycobacterial signaling networks in parallel with the changing environment. IntroductionThe characteristic nature of the cell envelope of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is linked to its pathogenicity. The thick layer of lipids on the outer surface of mycobacteria is protective in nature, and mycolic acids comprise the bulk of this layer. Mycolic acids also constitute structural components of the cell wall and envelope (1Barry 3rd, C.E. Lee R.E. Mdluli K. Sampson A.E. Schroeder B.G. Slayden R.A. Yuan Y. Prog.

Mycobacteria are unique in having two fatty-acid synthase (FAS) 5The abbreviations used are: FASfatty-acid synthaseMBPmaltose-binding proteinNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidACPacyl carrier proteinSTPKserine/threonine protein kinase. systems, FAS-I and FAS-II, and both of these pathways are involved in the synthesis of mycolic acids. Eukaryotic-like FAS-I is a single multidomain enzyme, whereas FAS-II includes discrete monofunctional enzymes that carry out the various sequential steps involved in the process of synthesis (3Bloch K. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1977; 45: 1-84PubMed Google Scholar). The FAS-I system is responsible for the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis (4Smith S. Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), producing C20- and C26-S-enzyme derivatives that are converted to the respective coenzyme A (CoA) forms and then released. The C20 fatty acid is the probable starting point for the FAS-II system (2Takayama K. Wang C. Besra G.S. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 18: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar), and the C26 fatty acid is incorporated as the α-branch of mycolic acid (5Asselineau J. Lederer E. Nature. 1950; 166: 782-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).FabH (β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III) forms the link between the two FAS systems by condensing the long chain acyl-CoA products (produced by FAS-I) and malonyl-ACP (produced from malonyl-CoA by the action of FabD (malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase) (6Kremer L.

The ACP-bound acyl chain thus becomes two carbon units longer than the starting chain and now undergoes repetitive cycles of reduction, with the exception that the ketosynthases KasA or KasB substitute for FabH. InhA, the 2-trans-enoyl-ACP reductase of the FAS-II system (9Marrakchi H. Lanéelle G. Quémard A. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), was first identified as the gene encoding a target of the drugs isoniazid and ethionamide, following the characterization of genetic variants that conferred resistance to these drugs (10Banerjee A.

Biochemical analysis of InhA revealed that InhA catalyzes NADH-specific reduction of 2-trans-enoyl-ACP with preference for long chain substrates (C12–C24) (11Quémard A. Sacchettini J.C. Dessen A. Vilcheze C. Bittman R. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8235-8241Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). InhA is also essential for the survival of mycobacteria; inactivation of InhA affects mycobacteria acutely, causing accumulation of saturated fatty acids, the end products of FAS-I (12Vilchèze C.

The mycobacterial FAS-II multienzyme complex has been identified to be a target of M. tuberculosis STPKs, with substrates, including the malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase FabD and the β-ketoacyl-ACP synthases KasA and KasB. These proteins are phosphorylated by various kinases in vitro; however, the phosphorylation is found to be most efficient with PknA. Interestingly, although phosphorylation has a negative impact on the activity of KasA, KasB activity is enhanced upon phosphorylation (24Molle V. Brown A.K. Besra G.S. Cozzone A.J. Kremer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30094-30103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 25Bhatt A. Molle V. Besra G.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Kremer L. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 64: 1442-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Recently, MabA, the β-ketoacyl-ACP reductase, has been demonstrated to be negatively regulated following phosphorylation (26Veyron-Churlet R. Zanella-Cléon I. Cohen-Gonsaud M. Molle V. Kremer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 12714-12725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). FabH (β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase III) has also been shown to be a substrate of several kinases, particularly PknA and PknF. Phosphorylation of FabH has an inhibitory effect on enzyme activity (27Veyron-Churlet R. Molle V. Taylor R.C. Brown A.K. Besra G.S. Zanella-Cléon I. Fütterer K. Kremer L. J. Biol.

InhA phosphorylation mediated by the STPKs has been validated in vivo, using both Escherichia coli as a surrogate host as well as in Mycobacterium smegmatis. The putative phosphorylation sites have been identified. We demonstrate that the phosphorylation status of InhA is critical to the function and/or activity of InhA and alters the growth profile of mycobacteria. Most importantly, results from studies carried out with an inhA conditional gene replacement strain emphasize the crucial role of the phosphorylation status of InhA in mediating mycobacterial survival.DISCUSSIONM. tuberculosis kinases have a plethora of substrates (16Chao J. Wong D. Zheng X. Poirier V. Bach H. Hmama Z. Av-Gay Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2010; 1804: 620-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), including several key enzymes of the FAS system (24Molle V. Brown A.K. Besra G.S. Cozzone A.J. Kremer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30094-30103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Veyron-Churlet R. Zanella-Cléon I. Cohen-Gonsaud M. Molle V. Kremer L. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 2010; 75: 1064-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As the substrates identified to date in the FAS pathway are proficiently phosphorylated by PknA, we scrutinized the primary sequence of all the enzymes in the FAS pathway for the presence of the consensus “TQ” motif. Our analysis revealed that KasB, which was shown to be a substrate of these kinases (24Molle V. Brown A.K. Besra G.S. Cozzone A.J. Kremer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30094-30103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and InhA harbor this motif. The possibility of InhA also being a part of the signaling network of these kinases thus became a subject of interest to us. Our data illustrate robust phosphorylation of InhA by PknA and PknB, in agreement with the prediction of this enzyme being a target substrate (Fig. 1). InhA is an important component of the FAS-II pathway, the loss of which results in retarded growth and subsequent cell lysis (12Vilchèze C. Morbidoni H.R. Weisbrod T.R. Iwamoto H. Kuo M. Sacchettini J.C. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4059-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 13Bhatt A. Kremer L. Dai A.Z. Sacchettini J.C. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7596-7606Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Our in vitro InhA activity assay results suggested that phosphorylation of InhA results in decreased enzymatic activity (Fig. 6). Furthermore, in line with these results, we found that the strain expressing InhA-T266E has a delayed growth phenotype compared with the strain expressing the wild type form of the protein (Fig. 7). Most importantly, the InhA-T266E mutant failed to functionally complement the inhA conditional gene replacement mutant (Fig. 8) (13Bhatt A. Kremer L. Dai A.Z. Sacchettini J.C. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7596-7606Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), implying phosphorylation-dependent modulation of InhA function. The fact that a number of enzymes involved mycolic acid biosynthesis pathway, including InhA, are regulated by serine/threonine protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation emphasizes the crucial role of the phosphorylation in mediating mycobacterial survival.A complete understanding of phosphorylation events in a global context entails determining whether a substrate is part of a larger network involving multiple kinases. Thus far, in vitro kinase assays with purified M. tuberculosis kinases and the substrate in question have been employed by various groups to address this vital issue (24Molle V. Brown A.K. Besra G.S.

PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e49Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We have devised an expedient method to assess the potential candidacy of protein substrates using all 11 M. tuberculosis STPKs (Fig. 2). This involves use of a dual expression vector pDuet-1. We have generated a series of 12 pDuet constructs harboring MBP kinase/MBP tag in MCS2; the putative substrate can be cloned in MCS1 (Fig. 2). The resulting plasmids are ideal for co-expression of the kinase-substrate pair, respectively, in the surrogate host E. coli. As the phosphorylation event takes place in vivo in the surrogate host, results obtained are free of the problems associated with in vitro reactions. This methodology provides an excellent in vivo tool, which can be used widely to assess phosphorylation of potential substrate by all 11 kinases of M. tuberculosis. Using this method, we have been able to demonstrate that PknA, PknB, and PknH efficiently target InhA, although PknF also targets it but to a lower extent (Fig. 3).Identifying phosphorylation sites on a target substrate is a challenging task. We used a combination of peptide maps with mutant substrates and comparative kinase assays to determine the phosphorylation sites on InhA. A detailed scrutiny indicated that major sites of phosphorylation were present in the same tryptic peptide of InhA. Our inability to account for all the spots observed could be due to the presence of multiple phosphorylation sites on the same peptide (Fig. 4). In conjunction with kinase assays, we identified Thr-253, Thr-254, and Thr-266 to be the major targets for PknA/PknB-mediated phosphorylation and validated the same (Fig. 4). Two-dimensional gels have been used to confirm in vivo phosphorylation status of KasA, KasB, and FabH (24Molle V. Brown A.K. Besra G.S. Cozzone A.J. Kremer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 30094-30103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 27Veyron-Churlet R. Molle V. Taylor R.C. Brown A.K. Besra G.S. Zanella-Cléon I. Fütterer K. Kremer L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 6414-6424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In agreement with our in vitro results, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis of InhA co-expressed with PknA or PknB in E. coli demonstrated phosphorylation on multiple sites (Fig. 5). InhA isolated from M. smegmatis strain harboring pMV261-InhA plasmid appears to be effectively phosphorylated as seen by two-dimensional gel analysis. We also validated Thr-266 to be a major phosphorylation site in vivo in mycobacteria by means of the same approach (Fig. 5). Furthermore, we observed multiple spots when M. smegmatis lysates were probed with anti-InhA antibodies (Fig. 5), suggesting phosphorylation of InhA under endogenous expression conditions.Phosphorylation-dephosphorylation events are a mode of regulating cellular functions. STPK-mediated phosphorylation events in M. tuberculosis are no exception to this paradigm. Several illustrations have been well documented in the literature (37Molle V. Kremer L. Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 75: 1064-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation events of the transcriptional regulator EmbR affect its ATPase activity and binding with DNA (40Sharma K. Gupta M. Krupa A. Srinivasan N. Singh Y. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 2711-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Interactions of anti-anti-σ factor homolog Rv0516c with its anti-anti-anti-σ factor, and of Rv2175c, a DNA-binding protein of unknown function, with DNA, are abrogated upon phosphorylation by kinases (39Greenstein A.E.

Functions of cell division proteins Wag31 and FtsZ are also modulated by phosphorylation (42Kang C.M. Nyayapathy S. Lee J.Y. Suh J.W. Husson R.N.

Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8235-8241Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) in 1995 demonstrated activity of InhA by an indirect method in which the action of InhA is measured by monitoring NADH oxidation that occurs concurrently with substrate reduction. Upon performing time course assays and kinetics experiments with InhA and p-InhA, we observed a stark difference, with phosphorylation appearing to down-regulate the enzymatic efficiency of InhA (Fig. 6).Because the phosphorylation of InhA results in decreased activity, we hypothesized that the overexpression of InhA and kinase may impact the growth of mycobacteria, due to hyperphosphorylation of InhA. PknA overexpression was demonstrated by to be detrimental to the growth (18Kang C.M. Abbott D.W. Park S.T. Dascher C.C. Cantley L.C. Husson R.N. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1692-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). This is most likely due to hyperphosphorylation of a number of substrates, including InhA. We observed that overexpression of InhA and PknA significantly compromised the growth over and above the effects observed due to overexpression of PknA alone (Fig. 7). Despite our best efforts, we were unable to co-express PknB and InhA in M. smegmatis. It is possible that the deleterious effects on mycobacterial growth upon co-expression of PknB and InhA were so severe that cells overexpressing both proteins may not have survived. Furthermore, in line with these results, we found that the strain expressing InhA-T266E has a delayed growth phenotype compared with the strain expressing the wild type form of the protein (Fig. 7). Most importantly, InhA-T266E mutant failed to functionally complement the InhA conditional gene replacement mutant (13Bhatt A. Kremer L. Dai A.Z. Sacchettini J.C. Jacobs Jr., W.R. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 7596-7606Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), strengthening our hypothesis (Fig. 8). In addition, co-expression of InhA-T266A mutant alongside PknA was found to partially alleviate the diminution in growth (Fig. 7), emphasizing the importance of phosphorylation at Thr-266. The fact that InhA-T266A mutant + PknA overexpression did not bring growth back to PknA-only overexpression levels suggests that, in addition to Thr-266, PknA also targets other sites such as Thr-253 and Thr-254 in vivo. InhA is shown to function as a dimer. Hence, it is likely that hyperphosphorylated InhA (when the kinase is overexpressed) is behaving like a dominant negative enzyme by titrating away unphosphorylated InhA.Based on our data, we conclude that InhA is a target of multiple mycobacterial STPKs, and the resulting phosphorylations are instrumental in negatively modulating the growth of the bacterium by virtue of decreased activity of this enzyme. In depth studies by other groups have shown that other members of the FAS-II pathway, namely FabD, KasA, KasB, and MabA, as well as FabH that links the FAS-I and FAS-II pathways, are also regulated by phosphorylation attributed to these kinases (24Molle V.

The identification of InhA as a novel substrate being phosphorylated by multiple STPKs, along with other FAS enzymes, is indicative of the various permutations and combinations by which the mycolic acid synthesis is regulated in vivo. A blend of multiple kinases, multiple substrates, and multiple levels of fine-tuning of enzymatic activity based on phosphorylation status puts forth an elegant and elaborate manner in which mycolic acid synthesis can be tightly restrained, in tandem with a multitude of intracellular and extracellular cues in the bacteria.

Eukaryotic-like FAS-I is a single multidomain enzyme, whereas FAS-II includes discrete monofunctional enzymes that carry out the various sequential steps involved in the process of synthesis (3Bloch K. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1977; 45: 1-84PubMed Google Scholar). The FAS-I system is responsible for the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis (4Smith S. Witkowski A. Joshi A.K. Prog. Lipid Res. 2003; 42: 289-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), producing C20- and C26-S-enzyme derivatives that are converted to the respective coenzyme A (CoA) forms and then released.

We demonstrate that the phosphorylation status of InhA is critical to the function and/or activity of InhA and alters the growth profile of mycobacteria.

https://openalex.org/W1965902487,"Correction of double strand DNA breaks proceeds in an error-free pathway of homologous recombination (HR), which can result in gene silencing of half of the DNA molecules caused by action by DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) (Cuozzo, C., Porcellini, A., Angrisano, T., Morano, A., Lee, B., Di Pardo, A., Messina, S., Iuliano, R., Fusco, A., Santillo, M. R., Muller, M. T., Chiariotti, L., Gottesman, M. E., and Avvedimento, E. V. (2007) PLoS Genet. 3, e110). To explore the mechanism that leads to HR-induced silencing, a genetic screen was carried out based on the silencing of a GFP reporter to identify potential partners. DMAP1, a DNMT1 interacting protein, was identified as a mediator of this process. DMAP1 is a potent activator of DNMT1 methylation in vitro, suggesting that DMAP1 is a co-repressor that supports the maintenance and de novo action of DNMT1. To examine critical roles for DMAP1 in vivo, lentiviral shRNA was used to conditionally reduce cellular DMAP1 levels. The shRNA transduced cells grew poorly and eventually ceased their growth. Analysis of the tumor suppressor gene p16 methylation status revealed a clear reduction in methylated CpGs in the shRNA cells, suggesting that reactivation of a tumor suppressor gene pathway caused the slow growth phenotype. Analysis of HR, using a fluorescence-based reporter, revealed that knocking down DMAP1 also caused hypomethylation of the DNA repair products following gene conversion. DMAP1 was selectively enriched in recombinant GFP chromatin based on chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. The picture that emerges is that DMAP1 activates DNMT1 preferentially at sites of HR repair. Because DMAP1 depleted cells display enhanced HR, we conclude that it has additional roles in genomic stability."

The molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenesis are completely unknown. Recent work showed that translocation of the TRE17/USP6 locus occurs in over 60% of ABC cases resulting in TRE17 overexpression. Immature osteoblasts are presumed to be the cell type harboring translocation of TRE17 in at least a subset of ABCs. However, the effects of TRE17 overexpression on transformation and osteoblast function are unknown. TRE17 encodes a ubiquitin-specific protease (USP) and a TBC (TRE2-Bub2-Cdc16) domain that promotes activation of the Arf6 GTPase. Here we report that TRE17 potently inhibits the maturation of MC3T3 pre-osteoblasts in a USP-dependent and Arf6-independent manner. Notably, we find that TRE17 function is mediated through an autocrine mechanism. Transcriptome analysis of TRE17-expressing cells reveals dysregulation of several pathways with established roles in osteoblast maturation. In particular, signaling through the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway, a key regulator of osteogenesis, is profoundly altered. TRE17 simultaneously inhibits the expression of BMP-4 while augmenting the BMP antagonist, Gremlin-1. Osteoblastic maturation is restored in TRE17-expressing cells by the addition of exogenous BMP-4, thus establishing a functional role for BMP-4 during TRE17-induced transformation. Because bone homeostasis involves a precise balance between the activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts, our studies raise the possibility that attenuated osteoblast maturation caused by TRE17 overexpression may contribute to the bone loss/destruction observed in ABC.

We used protein design (Rosetta), rather than phylogenetic sequence alignments, to identify mutations to compensate for the severe loss of modularity, thus restoring stability, as evidenced by renaturation described previously and by 70-ns molecular dynamics simulations. Sufficient solubility to enable biochemical studies was achieved by expressing the redesigned Urzyme as a maltose-binding protein fusion. Michaelis-Menten kinetic parameters from amino acid activation assays showed that, compared with the native full-length enzyme, TrpRS Urzyme binds ATP with similar affinity. This suggests that neither of the two deleted structural modules has a strong influence on ground-state ATP binding. However, tryptophan has 103 lower affinity, and the Urzyme has comparably reduced specificity relative to the related amino acid, tyrosine. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed how CP1 may contribute significantly to cognate amino acid specificity. As class Ia editing domains are nested within the CP1, this finding suggests that this module enhanced amino acid specificity continuously, throughout their evolution. We call this type of reconstructed protein catalyst an Urzyme (Ur prefix indicates original, primitive, or earliest).

Until now, the regulatory mechanisms and genetic determinants involved in thuringiensin production have remained unclear. Here, we successfully used heterologous expression-guided screening in an Escherichia coli-Bacillus thuringiensis shuttle bacterial artificial chromosome library, to clone the intact thuringiensin synthesis (thu) cluster. Then the thu cluster was located on a 110-kb endogenous plasmid bearing insecticide crystal protein gene cry1Ba in strain CT-43. Furthermore, the plasmid, named pBMB0558, was indirectly cloned and sequenced. The gene functions on pBMB0558 were annotated by BLAST based on the GenBank(TM) and KEGG databases. The genes on pBMB0558 could be classified into three functional modules: a thuringiensin synthesis cluster, a type IV secretion system-like module, and mobile genetic elements. By HPLC coupling mass spectrometer, atmospheric pressure ionization with ion trap, and TOF technologies, biosynthetic intermediates of thuringiensin were detected. The thuE gene is proved to be responsible for the phosphorylation of thuringiensin at the last step by vivo and vitro activity assays. The thuringiensin biosynthesis pathway was deduced and clarified. We propose that thuringiensin is an adenine nucleoside oligosaccharide rather than an adenine nucleotide analog, as is traditionally believed, based on the predicted functions of the key enzymes, glycosyltransferase (ThuF) and exopolysaccharide polymerization protein (Thu1)."

It was recently reported to affect the outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.In our studies on KIR2DS5 gene associations with human diseases, we compared the frequencies of this gene in patients and relevant controls. Typing for KIR2DS5 gene was performed by either individual or multiplex polymerase chain reactions which, when compared in the same samples, gave concordant results. We noted an apparently protective effect of KIR2DS5 gene presence in several clinical conditions, but not in others. Namely, this effect was observed in ankylosing spondylitis (p=0.003, odds ratio [OR]=0.47, confidence interval [CI]=0.28-0.79), endometriosis (p=0.03, OR=0.25, CI = 0.07-0.82) and acute rejection of kidney graft (p=0.0056, OR=0.44, CI=0.24-0.80), but not in non-small-cell lung carcinoma, rheumatoid arthritis, spontaneous abortion, or leukemia (all p>0.05). In addition, the simultaneous presence of KIR2DS5 gene and HLA-C C1 allotype exhibited an even stronger protective effect on ankylosing spondylitis (p=0.0003, OR=0.35, CI=0.19-0.65), whereas a lack of KIR2DS5 and the presence of the HLA-C C2 allotype was associated with ankylosing spondylitis (p=0.0017, OR=1.92, CI=1.28-2.89), whereas a lack of KIR2DS5 and presence of C1 allotype was associated with rheumatoid arthritis (p=0.005, OR=1.47, CI=1.13-1.92). The presence of both KIR2DS5 and C1 seemed to protect from acute kidney graft rejection (p=0.017, OR=0.47, CI=0.25-0.89), whereas lack of KIR2DS5 and presence of C2 seemed to favor rejection (p=0.0015, OR=2.13, CI=1.34-3.37).Our results suggest that KIR2DS5 may protect from endometriosis, ankylosing spondylitis, and acute rejection of kidney graft."
https://openalex.org/W2159842176,"Communication with patients is a core clinical skill in medicine that can be acquired through communication skills training. Meanwhile, the importance of transfer of communication skills to the workplace has not been sufficiently studied. This study aims to assess the efficacy of a 40-hour training program designed to improve patients' satisfaction and residents' communication skills during their daily clinical rounds.Residents were randomly assigned to the training program or to a waiting list. Patients' satisfaction was assessed with a visual analog scale after each visit. Transfer of residents' communication skills was assessed in audiotaped actual inpatient visits during a half-day clinical round. Transcripted audiotapes were analyzed using content analysis software (LaComm). Training effects were tested with Mann-Whitney tests and generalized linear Poisson regression models.Eighty-eight residents were included. First, patients interacting with trained residents reported a higher satisfaction with residents' communication (Median=92) compared to patients interacting with untrained residents (Median=88) (p=.046). Second, trained residents used more assessment utterances (Relative Risk (RR)=1.17; 95% Confidence intervals (95%CI)=1.02-1.34; p=.023). Third, transfer was also observed when residents' training attendance was considered: residents' use of assessment utterances (RR=1.01; 95%CI=1.01-1.02; p=.018) and supportive utterances (RR=0.99; 95%CI=0.98-1.00; p=.042) (respectively 1.15 (RR), 1.08-1.23 (95%CI), p<.001 for empathy and 0.95 (RR), 0.92-0.99 (95%CI), p=.012 for reassurance) was proportional to the number of hours of training attendance.The training program improved patients' satisfaction and allowed the transfer of residents' communication skills learning to the workplace. Transfer was directly related to training attendance but remained limited. Future studies should therefore focus on the improvement of the efficacy of communication skills training in order to ensure a more important training effect size on transfer."
https://openalex.org/W2026415662,"Selective visual attention is the process by which the visual system enhances behaviorally relevant stimuli and filters out others. Visual attention is thought to operate through a cortical mechanism known as biased competition. Representations of stimuli within cortical visual areas compete such that they mutually suppress each others' neural response. Competition increases with stimulus proximity and can be biased in favor of one stimulus (over another) as a function of stimulus significance, salience, or expectancy. Though there is considerable evidence of biased competition within the human visual system, the dynamics of the process remain unknown.Here, we used scalp-recorded electroencephalography (EEG) to examine neural correlates of biased competition in the human visual system. In two experiments, subjects performed a task requiring them to either simultaneously identify two targets (Experiment 1) or discriminate one target while ignoring a decoy (Experiment 2). Competition was manipulated by altering the spatial separation between target(s) and/or decoy. Both experimental tasks should induce competition between stimuli. However, only the task of Experiment 2 should invoke a strong bias in favor of the target (over the decoy). The amplitude of two lateralized components of the event-related potential, the N2pc and Ptc, mirrored these predictions. N2pc amplitude increased with increasing stimulus separation in Experiments 1 and 2. However, Ptc amplitude varied only in Experiment 2, becoming more positive with decreased spatial separation.These results suggest that N2pc and Ptc components may index distinct processes of biased competition--N2pc reflecting visual competitive interactions and Ptc reflecting a bias in processing necessary to individuate task-relevant stimuli."

CAG repeat polymorphism and X chromosome methylation patterns were compared between PCOS and non-PCOS women. 250 PCOS women and 299 controls were included for this study. Androgen receptor CAG repeat sizes, XCI percentages, and clinical and biochemical parameters were measured. The mean CAG repeat number is similar between the cases (18.74±0.13) and controls (18.73±0.12). The obese PCOS women were significantly more frequent in the <18 and >20 CAG repeat category than the lean PCOS women, yielding a highly significant odds (p=0.001). Among the women with non-random X-inactivation, alleles with <19 repeats were more frequently activated among cases than controls (p=0.33). CAG repeat polymorphism by itself cannot be considered as a useful marker for discriminating PCOS. We observed a trend of preferential activation of the shorter allele among the PCOS cases with non random XCI pattern. In the obese PCOS women, this microsatellite variation may account for the hyperandrogenicity to a larger extent than the lean PCOS women."

The present study was conducted to examine the interactive roles of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), Ets-1, Sp1, and histone acetylation on the transcriptional regulation and function of the Npr1 gene. Deletion analysis of the Npr1 promoter and luciferase assays showed that ATRA enhanced a 16-fold Npr1 promoter activity and greatly stimulated guanylyl cyclase (GC) activity of the receptor protein in both atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)-dependent and -independent manner. As confirmed by gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, ATRA enhanced the binding of both Ets-1 and Sp1 to the Npr1 promoter. The retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) was recruited by Ets-1 and Sp1 to form a transcriptional activator complex with their binding sites in the Npr1 promoter. Interestingly, ATRA also increased the acetylation of histones H3 and H4 and enhanced their recruitment to Ets-1 and Sp1 binding sites within the Npr1 promoter. Collectively, the present results demonstrate that ATRA regulates Npr1 gene transcription and GC activity of the receptor by involving the interactive actions of Ets-1, Sp1, and histone acetylation."
https://openalex.org/W2075470329,"Background The Drosophila C virus (DCV) is a common and well-studied Drosophila pathogen. Although natural infections are known from Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans, and artificial infections have been reported from several Drosophila species and other insects, it remains unclear to date whether DCV infections also occur naturally in other Drosophila species. Methods/Principal Findings Using reverse transcription PCR, we detected natural infections in six Drosophila species, which have not been previously known as natural hosts. By subsequent Sanger sequencing we compared DCV haplotypes among eight Drosophila host species. Our data suggest that cross-infections might be frequent both within and among species within the laboratory environment. Moreover, we find that some lines exhibit multiple infections with distinct DCV haplotypes. Conclusions Our results suggest that the natural host range of DCV is much broader than previously assumed and that cross-infections might be a common phenomenon in the laboratory, even among different Drosophila hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2165268159,"Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) regulates cellular proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival. The human TGF-β1 transcript is inherently poorly translated, and translational activation has been documented in relation to several stimuli. In this paper, we have sought to identify in cis regulatory elements within the TGF-β1 5′Untranslated Region (5′UTR). In silico analysis predicted formation of stable secondary structure in a G/C-rich element between nucleotides +77 to +106, and demonstrated that this element is highly conserved across species. Circular dichroism spectroscopy confirmed the presence of secondary structure in this region. The proximal 5′UTR was inhibitory to translation in reporter gene experiments, and mutation of the secondary structure motif increased translational efficiency. Translational regulation of TGF-β1 mRNA is linked to altered binding of YB-1 protein to its 5′UTR. Immunoprecipitation-RT-qPCR demonstrated a high basal association of YB-1 with TGF-β1 mRNA. However, mutation of the secondary structure motif did not prevent interaction of YB-1 with the 5′UTR, suggesting that YB-1 binds to this region due to its G/C-rich composition, rather than a specific, sequence-dependent, binding site. These data identify a highly conserved element within the TGF-β1 5′UTR that forms stable secondary structure, and is responsible for the inherent low translation efficiency of this cytokine."
https://openalex.org/W1975957967,"Botulinum toxins, i.e. BoNT/A to/G, include the most toxic substances known. Since botulism is a potentially fatal neuroparalytic disease with possible use as a biowarfare weapon (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention category A bioterrorism agent), intensive efforts are being made to develop vaccines or neutralizing antibodies. The use of active fragments from non-human immunoglobulins (F(ab')2, Fab', scFv), chemically modified or not, may avoid side effects, but also largely modify the in vivo half-life and effectiveness of these reagents. We evaluated the neutralizing activity of several monoclonal anti-BoNT/A antibodies (mAbs). F(ab')2 fragments, native or treated with polyethyleneglycol (PEG), were prepared from selected mAbs to determine their half-life and neutralizing activity as compared with the initial mAbs. We compared the protective efficiency of the different biochemical forms of anti-toxin mAbs providing the same neutralizing activity. Among fourteen tested mAbs, twelve exhibited neutralizing activity. Fragments from two of the best mAbs (TA12 and TA17), recognizing different epitopes, were produced. These two mAbs neutralized the A1 subtype of the toxin more efficiently than the A2 or A3 subtypes. Since mAb TA12 and its fragments both exhibited the greatest neutralizing activity, they were further evaluated in the therapeutic experiments. These showed that, in a mouse model, a 2- to 4-h interval between toxin and antitoxin injection allows the treatment to remain effective, but also suggested an absence of correlation between the half-life of the antitoxins and the length of time before treatment after botulinum toxin A contamination. These experiments demonstrate that PEG treatment has a strong impact on the half-life of the fragments, without affecting the effectiveness of neutralization, which was maintained after preparation of the fragments. These reagents may be useful for rapid treatment after botulinum toxin A contamination."
https://openalex.org/W2139675721,"Ribosomes synthesizing secretory and membrane proteins are bound to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and attach to ribosome-associated membrane proteins such as the Sec61 complex, which forms the protein-conducting channel in the membrane. The ER membrane-resident Hsp40 protein ERj1 was characterized as being able to recruit BiP to ribosomes in solution and to regulate protein synthesis in a BiP-dependent manner. Here, we show that ERj1 and Sec61 are associated with ribosomes at the ER of human cells and that the binding of ERj1 to ribosomes occurs with a binding constant in the picomolar range and is prevented by pretreatment of ribosomes with RNase. However, the affinity of ERj1 for ribosomes dramatically changes upon binding of BiP. This modulation by BiP may be responsible for the dual role of ERj1 at the ribosome, i.e. acting as a recruiting factor for BiP and regulating translation."
https://openalex.org/W2067736077,"One of the important questions in the field of virus research is about the balance between latent and lytic cycles of replication. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) remains predominantly in a latent state, with only 1–3% of cells supporting a lytic replication at any time. KSHV glycoprotein B (gB) is expressed not only on the virus envelope but also on the surfaces of the few cells supporting lytic replication. Using co-culture experiments, we determined that expression of KSHV gB on as few as 1–2% of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells resulted in a 10-fold inhibition of expression of ORF50, a viral gene critical for the onset of lytic replication. Also, we demonstrate that such a profound inhibitory effect of gB on the lytic cycle of virus replication is by repressing the ability of Egr-1 (early growth response-1) to bind and activate the ORF50 promoter. In general, virus-encoded late stage structural proteins, such as gB, are said to play major roles in virus entry and egress. The present report provides initial evidence supporting a role for membrane-associated gB expressed in a minimal number of cells to promote virus latency.

Whitman A.G. Ford P.W. Shelton J.G. McCubrey J.A. Akula S.M. Leukemia. 2005; 19: 18-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Similar to other herpesviruses, KSHV has two phases of replication: lytic and latent. In vivo, KSHV is known to remain predominantly in a latent state, with only 1–3% of cells supporting a lytic infection (2Chen L. Lagunoff M. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 14383-14391Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have reported the ability of inflammatory cytokines and virus-encoded K1 and virus-encoded G protein-coupled receptor to inhibit lytic replication of KSHV (3Milligan S. Robinson M. O'Donnell E. Blackbourn D.J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2591-2596Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 4Ye F.C. Zhou F.C. Xie J.P. Kang T. Greene W. Kuhne K. Lei X.F. Li Q.H. Gao S.J. J.

We now demonstrate that KSHV glycoprotein B (gB), one of the essential glycoproteins (7Akula S.M. Pramod N.P. Wang F.Z. Chandran B. Virology. 2001; 284: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), is also involved.

KSHV gB is a lytic structural protein that is normally expressed on the envelope of mature virions but can be presented on the surface of cells supporting a lytic infection. A previous study conducted by our laboratory demonstrated that KSHV-infected cells supporting a lytic infection directed adhesion of cells. The mechanism of cell-cell adhesion, specifically in cells supporting a late stage of lytic replication, was mediated by gB instead of cellular integrins (8Dyson O.F. Oxendine T.L. Hamden K.E. Ford P.W. Akula S.M. Cell Microbiol. 2008; 10: 1546-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This led us to suggest that gB expressed on the cell membranes may have a significant role in KS pathogenesis, particularly inducing cell survival signaling in cells apart from its role in virus binding, entry, and egress (7Akula S.M. Pramod N.P. Wang F.Z. Chandran B. Virology. 2001; 284: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 9Akula S.M. Pramod N.P. Wang F.Z. Chandran B.

Virol. 2008; 82: 7144-7154Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Cell survival is a crucial factor supporting virus infection and reactivation from latency (11Bryan B.A. Dyson O.F. Akula S.M. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Activation of genes involved in cell survival is often regulated by NFκB signaling. KSHV infection activates NFκB signaling (12An J. Sun Y. Sun R. Rettig M.B. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3371-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Moreover, enhanced NFκB signaling is said to inhibit KSHV reactivation (4Ye F.C. Zhou F.C. Xie J.P. Kang T. Greene W. Kuhne K. Lei X.F. Li Q.H. Gao S.J. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 4235-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined the effects of gB on NFκB signaling using PCR arrays. Our results from the analysis of arrays demonstrated gB to significantly lower expression of egr-1 (early growth response-1) in target cells. Incidentally, gB expressed on 1–2% of cells could significantly inhibit Egr-1 expression in KSHV-infected target cells via autocrine and paracrine effects. Egr-1 is a nuclear protein with three consensus zinc finger sequences repeated in tandem that function as a transcription factor (13Christy B. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1989; 86: 8737-8741Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), regulating a variety of cellular functions (14Thiel G. Cibelli G. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 193: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Earlier studies have demonstrated roles for proteins, such as the virus-encoded G protein-coupled receptor, expressed during the lytic cycle of replication (like gB), in mediating both autocrine and paracrine effects (15Cannon M. Philpott N.J. Cesarman E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 57-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 16Choi Y.B. Nicholas J. Virology. 2010; 397: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) but primarily using transfection-based approaches. In the present report, for the first time, we used co-culture experiments to delineate the role of gB expressed on as few as 1–2% of cells to promote virus latency via altering Egr-1 expression. In the process, we describe an interesting pathophysiology initiated by gB expressed on a minimal number of cells. HMVEC-d cells were propagated in EGMTM MV-microvascular endothelial cell medium (Clonetics) as per standard protocols (9Akula S.M. Pramod N.P. Wang F.Z. Chandran B. Cell. 2002; 108: 407-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The passage numbers for HMVEC-d cells used in this study ranged between 5 and 9. 293 and BCBL-1 cells were cultured in DMEM and RPMI (Invitrogen) as per earlier studies (17Ford P.W. Hamden K.E. Whitman A.G. McCubrey J.A. Akula S.M. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Dyson O.F. Ford P.W. Chen D. Li Y.Q. Akula S.M. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2009; 13: 1920-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). pCDNA3.1.CT-GFP-TOPO (pCDNA), gB/pCDNA3.1.CT-GFP-TOPO (gB/pCDNA), and gL/pCDNA are plasmids that encode full-length gB and gL, respectively (7Akula S.M. Pramod N.P. Wang F.Z. Chandran B. Virology. 2001; 284: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 19Naranatt P.P. Akula S.M. Chandran B. Arch. Virol. 2002; 147: 1349-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Like gB, gL is also expressed independently on the cell membrane (19Naranatt P.P. Akula S.M. Chandran B. Arch. Virol. 2002; 147: 1349-1370Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Another plasmid, gB-RGA/pCDNA, encodes for full-length gB with a mutation to the RGD domain (RGD to RGA). All of these plasmids encode green fluorescent protein (GFP), which was used as a marker for sorting cells. We also used egr-1/pCDNA3.1(+) and gL/pCDNA3.1(+) vectors without the GFP tag for the short interfering RNA (siRNA) experiments (Fig. 2) and luciferase assay. Vectors pCMV and pCMV-MEK1 (20Ford P.W.

Antibodies to gB, anti-RGDgB-N1 (developed against RGD-containing peptide sequences in gB; amino acids 27–44), anti-gB-C (developed against non-RGD-containing peptide sequences in gB; amino acids 828–845) (9Akula S.M. Pramod N.P. Wang F.Z. Chandran B. Cell. 2002; 108: 407-419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar); anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-total ERK1/2, anti-actin, and monoclonal antibodies (15F7) to Egr-1 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) were used in this study. All of the above antibodies were made in rabbits. A mouse anti-Egr-1 monoclonal antibody purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) was used in the immunofluorescence assay. U0126 was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) and used in this study. Expression and purification of the recombinant KSHV gBΔTM (2106 bp; encoding amino acids 1–702 lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains) and gBΔTM-RGA proteins from the infected High-5 cells were done using nickel columns (PharMingen, Pasadena, CA) as per procedures described before (21Wang F.Z. Akula S.M. Sharma-Walia N. Zeng L. Chandran B. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3131-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). All of the reagents (including the above recombinant proteins) used in this study were prepared using endotoxin-free water. Additionally, the sample preparation was tested and determined free of contamination using an end point chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (Charles River Laboratories, Charleston, SC). Target cells were treated with different concentrations of gBΔTM at 37 °C in a V-bottom 96-well plate. After a 24-h incubation, the cells were analyzed for the expression of LDH, as an indicator of cell death. The LDH assay was performed using the CytoTox 96 non-radioactive kit (Promega) as per earlier studies (22Shaw A.M. Braun L. Frew T. Hurley D.J. Rowland R.R. Chase C.C. Virology. 2000; 268: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We analyzed the manner by which gB could possibly alter signaling in endothelial cells using the NFκB signaling pathway PCR arrays. Briefly, cells cultured in growth medium were either left untreated or treated with 100 ng/ml gBΔTM at 37 °C. At the end of 2 and 4 h post-treatment, the cells were lysed, RNA was extracted, and cDNA was prepared (23Hamden K.E. Ford P.W. Whitman A.G. Dyson O.F. Cheng S.Y. McCubrey J.A. Akula S.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13381-13390Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The cDNA was later used to analyze the profile of 84 genes regulated by NFκB signaling using the PCR array (catalog no. PAHS-025) as per the manufacturer's recommendations (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD). The qRT-PCR was performed using the synthesized cDNA in a 25-µl reaction volume to analyze the expression of ORF50, egr-1, and β-actin as per earlier protocols (24Dyson O.F. Bryan B.A. Lambert P.J. Ford P.W. Akula S.M. Intervirology. 2007; 50: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). HMVEC-d cells were infected as per earlier procedures (25Krishnan H.H. Naranatt P.P. Smith M.S. Zeng L. Bloomer C. Chandran B. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3601-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Briefly, monolayers of HMVEC-d cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 10 ORF73 units for 2 h (26Naranatt P.P. Akula S.M. Zien C.A. Krishnan H.H. Chandran B. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1524-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). After incubation, the cells were washed three times in DMEM before incubating in growth medium for 48 h. This allowed virus to establish a latent infection of cells. This assay was developed to analyze the effect of membrane-bound gB on the expression of egr-1 and ORF50 (virus reactivation). Two cell populations were used in this assay: the target and the effector cells. Target cells were HMVEC-d cells that were cultured as monolayers in 12-well plates. The effector cell population included 293 cells that were untransfected or were transfected with pCDNA, gB/pCDNA, or gL/pCDNA using the Nucleofector II device (27Ralph J.A. Zocco D. Bresnihan B. Fitzgerald O. McEvoy A.N. Murphy E.P. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We tested 293, HFF, HMVEC-d, and COS-1 cells as effector cells. We determined that 293 cells expressed gB on their cell surface at levels comparable with BCBL-1 cells that were induced with TPA for 48 h as measured by the mean fluorescent intensity (data not shown). Target cells were infected with KSHV as described above (26Naranatt P.P. Akula S.M. Zien C.A. Krishnan H.H. Chandran B. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1524-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These cells were washed twice in DMEM before trypsinizing them to obtain single cell suspension. The above single cell suspension of KSHV-infected target cells was mixed with 2, 5, 10, and 30% of effector cells that specifically expressed gB on their cell surface; seeded onto a 12-well plate; and incubated in growth medium at 37 °C. The gB- and gL-positive cells were sorted using a flow cytometer based on the expression of GFP. The time at which the mixture of cells was seeded onto 12-well plates was considered as 0 h. At different time points (1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 h) post-seeding, the cells were lysed, RNA was extracted, cDNA was prepared, and the expression of ORF50 was monitored by qRT-PCR using specific primers. The relative copy numbers of the ORF50 transcripts were calculated from the standard graph plotted using the Ct values for different dilutions of in vitro transcribed ORF50 (using ORF50/pGEM-T plasmid). These values were normalized to each other using the values of the β-actin control reactions. As reported earlier (28Ford P.W. Hamden K.E. Whitman A.G. Bryan B.A. Chintalgattu V. McCubrey J.A. Dyson O.F. Akula S.M. Virus Res. 2005; 114: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), the lowest limit of detection in the standard samples was 6–60 copies for the ORF50 gene. Expression of egr-1 in the above cells was monitored in the same lines. Equal amounts of protein were used in Western blotting experiments as per earlier studies (24Dyson O.F. Bryan B.A. Lambert P.J. Ford P.W. Akula S.M. Intervirology. 2007; 50: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). We used 60 µg (3 times more) of protein in this experiment for clarity of the bands. The bands were scanned, and the band intensities were assessed using the ImageQuaNT software program (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of Egr-1 was inhibited by the transfection of double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides as described previously (23Hamden K.E. Ford P.W. Whitman A.G. Dyson O.F. Cheng S.Y. McCubrey J.A. Akula S.M. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13381-13390Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 29Akula S.M. Ford P.W. Whitman A.G. Hamden K.E. Bryan B.A. Cook P.P. McCubrey J.A. Blood. 2005; 105: 4516-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The siRNAs used in this experiment were obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) as the ON-TARGET plus Smart pool. The nonspecific (NS) siRNAs used were those described previously (29Akula S.M. Ford P.W. Whitman A.G. Hamden K.E. Bryan B.A. Cook P.P. McCubrey J.A. Blood. 2005; 105: 4516-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Target cells were fixed for 10 min in ice-cold acetone and washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). These cells were stained with mouse anti-Egr-1 monoclonal antibodies and rabbit peptide IgGs to Rta synthesized as per earlier studies (30Wang S.E. Wu F.Y. Fujimuro M. Zong J. Hayward S.D. Hayward G.S. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 600-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) for 45 min at room temperature and incubated with goat anti-mouse FITC and goat anti-rabbit TRITC (Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature. Stained cells were washed in PBS and examined under a Nikon fluorescent microscope with appropriate filters. IVT of egr-1/pCDNA3.1(+) and gL/pCDNA3.1(+) was conducted as per earlier studies using the TNT-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). IVT products of egr-1 or KSHV gL were evaluated by EMSA for DNA binding using a 25-bp DIG-labeled probe containing the ORF50 promoter (ORF50P) sequences (ORF50P probe). The probe encompasses the tttgacctgcgtgcgctctccggct sequence. 2.5 µl of IVT product and 50 ng/µl DIG-labeled probe were mixed in a binding buffer and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 min. Appropriate nonspecific probe at 1-µg amounts was used in the reaction. For supershift, IVT products were incubated with rabbit monoclonal antibodies to Egr-1 or nonspecific IgG at 37 °C for 30 min prior to the addition of the DIG-labeled probe. All samples were run on a 4% non- denaturing gel for ∼1.5 h and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The protein-DNA interaction was detected using the CSPD detection system (Roche Applied Science). The IP EMSA was conducted as per the procedures outlined in earlier studies (31Jamaluddin M. Choudhary S. Wang S. Casola A. Huda R. Garofalo R.P. Ray S. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 15302-15313Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using 0.5 mg of protein from target cells, precleared with normal rabbit serum and protein A-Sepharose. In another set of experiments, we analyzed the ability of Egr-1 in the nuclear extracts to bind ORF50P by performing EMSA. Briefly, we used the annealed double-stranded DIG-labeled oligonucleotides containing the consensus binding site for Egr-1 on ORF50P as described above. EMSA was performed as per procedures outlined for testing IVT-synthesized Egr-1 using 4 µg of nuclear extract. For supershift assays, we incubated nuclear extracts with 1:50, 1:500, and 1:5000 dilutions of rabbit monoclonal antibodies to Egr-1 or nonspecific IgG at 37 °C for 30 min prior to the addition of the DIG-labeled probe and analyzing the protein-DNA interactions as per standard procedures. Target cells grown to 65% confluence were transiently co-transfected with 500 ng of pCDNA3.1(+), egr-1/pCDNA3.1(+), or gL/pCDNA3.1(+); 500 ng/well pGL3 or ORF50P (nucleotides 68,509–71,593; KSHV genome sequence NC_003409)/pGL3; and an internal control pRL-TK (Promega). Transfections were performed using the Nucleofector II device as per the recommendations of the manufacturer (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). At 48 h post-transfection, cells were harvested, and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities in cell extracts were recorded using the dual luciferase system. Luciferase activity was monitored using a Turner Systems Luminometer (Sunnyvale, CA) as in earlier studies (32Chappell W.H. Green T.D. Spengeman J.D. McCubrey J.A. Akula S.M. Bertrand F.E. Cell Cycle. 2005; 4: 1389-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The relative luciferase activity was then calculated by normalizing ORF50P luciferase activity to control Renilla luciferase activity. The results were plotted as a percentage of the activity of the full-length promoter. In another set of experiments, 4 h prior to harvesting cells, the monolayers were incubated with 30% effector cells that were positive for gB expression or were transfected with empty vector. This was conducted to demonstrate the role of membrane-bound gB in regulating ORF50 activity. To determine the effect of KSHV gB on target cells, soluble gB protein lacking the transmembrane domain (gBΔTM) was first used. Coomassie staining of reduced gBΔTM protein yielded the expected three distinct bands at 36, 68, and 104 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1A). As suggested in the earlier studies (21Wang F.Z. Akula S.M. Sharma-Walia N. Zeng L. Chandran B. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3131-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), the 104-kDa protein probably represents the uncleaved gB precursor, and the 68-and 36-kDa proteins represent the cleaved and processed amino and carboxyl domains of the gBΔTM protein, respectively. Additional bands were not detected, indicating purity of the soluble protein. Treatment using rabbit anti-gB antibodies also led to the detection of three bands of the same molecular weight (Fig. 1A). The specificity of our antibodies was demonstrated by the lack of reactivity of normal rabbit sera and anti-gL antibodies (data not shown). HMVEC-d cells that were treated with gBΔTM at concentrations of 1 µg/ml and below did not significantly induce cell death as monitored by the lactate dehydrogenase assay (Fig. 1B). These results were confirmed by the conventional trypan blue test. More than 95% of the target cells were found to be viable when the target cells were treated with gBΔTM at concentrations of 1 µg/ml or below (data not shown). Such non-toxic doses were used in this study. Comparable results were observed in 293, HFF, and primary effusion lymphoma cells (data not shown). Doses of about 1–4 µg/ml gBΔTM have been successfully used in functional assays (21Wang F.Z. Akula S.M. Sharma-Walia N. Zeng L. Chandran B. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3131-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 33Sharma-Walia N. Naranatt P.P. Krishnan H.H. Zeng L. Chandran B. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 4207-4223Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The manner by which gB could possibly alter NFκB signaling in KSHV-infected endothelial cells was analyzed using NFκB signaling pathway PCR arrays. When comparing untreated cells to cells that were treated with gBΔTM, the most significant changes observed were in the genes egr-1, MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1), and caspase 8 (Fig. 1C). KSHV gBΔTM lowered expression of Egr-1 and caspase 8 mRNA in target cells. Incidentally, expression of MCP-1 was elevated in cells treated specifically with gBΔTM (Fig. 1C). Expression of IRAK-2 (Fig. 1C), β2-microglobulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and β-actin (data not shown) were not altered in response to treatment of cells with gBΔTM or in cells expressing gB on their cell surface, demonstrating the specificity of the data from the use of these arrays. These results were further confirmed by performing qRT-PCR using specific primers (data not shown). Cell cycle plays a major role in allowing KSHV reactivation to occur (11Bryan B.A. Dyson O.F. Akula S.M. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 34McAllister S.C. Hansen S.G. Messaoudi I. Nikolich-Zugich J. Moses A.V. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 2626-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed the above experiment in KSHV-infected cells derived from G0/1 and S phases of cell cycle by the serum starvation method (18Dyson O.F. Ford P.W. Chen D. Li Y.Q. Akula S.M. J. Cell Mol. Med. 2009; 13: 1920-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Interestingly, egr-1 was significantly lowered in cells derived from both G0/1 and S phases (supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). The cells cultured in growth medium (Fig. 1C) responded in a manner similar to those in G0/1 phase compared with those in S phase. This could partly be because the majority of the HMVEC-d cells cultured in growth medium are in G0/1 phase (70–75%) followed by G2/M (13–16%) and S (5–8%) phase, respectively (supplemental Fig. 3). The array data were confirmed by performing conventional Western blotting experiments. A dose-dependent inhibition of Egr-1 by gBΔTM in KSHV-infected target cells was observed (Fig. 1D). gBΔTM inhibited expression of Egr-1 when used at a concentration of ≥10 ng/ml. It did not alter the expression of β-actin at the concentrations tested (Fig. 1D). Nonspecific proteins GST and BSA (data not shown) did not have such an effect on Egr-1, confirming the specificity of the effect of gB. A similar effect on Egr-1 expression was noticed in BCBL-1 cells treated with increasing concentrations of soluble gBΔTM (data not shown). These results provide support for the ability of KSHV gB to inhibit the expression of Egr-1 at the transcriptional and translational levels in target cells. KSHV Rta (replication and transcription factor) is encoded by ORF50, an immediate early gene that is responsible for the activation of several lytic genes (35Lukac D.M. Kirshner J.R. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 9348-9361Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, a direct relationship between KSHV ORF50 and egr-1 has not been established. HMVEC-d cells supporting a latent KSHV infection were used to determine a possible association between the two. A significant increase in egr-1 expression was observed in KSHV-infected cells up to 12 h post-TPA treatment (Fig. 2A). Additionally, activation of ORF50 followed a similar increasing trend, indicating that TPA induced KSHV reactivation in these cells (Fig. 2A). In order to determine the necessity for Egr-1 in ORF50 expression, we monitored ORF50 expression in cells that were silenced for Egr-1 expression using specific double-stranded siRNA (36Ogishima T. Shiina H. Breault J.E. Terashima M. Honda S. Enokida H. Urakami S. Tokizane T. Kawakami T. Ribeiro-Filho L.A. Fujime M. Kane C.J. Carroll P.R. Igawa M. Dahiya R. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6765-6772Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The level of Egr-1 mRNA was significantly suppressed in HMVEC-d cells by siRNA specific to Egr-1 when compared with NS siRNA (Fig. 2B). An inhibition of 65 ± 8, 80 ± 4, and 55 ± 8% of Egr-1 mRNA was observed at 12, 24, and 48 h post-transfection. KSHV replication follows a unique pattern in HMVEC-d cells (25Krishnan H.H. Naranatt P.P. Smith M.S. Zeng L. Bloomer C. Chandran B. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3601-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The lytic gene ORF50 is expressed as early as 2 h post-infection (PI), declining sharply by 24 h PI. This early expression of Rta is not sufficient to activate a lytic infection. KSHV is said to establish a latent infection 48 h PI. TPA treatment of KSHV-infected HMVEC-d cells 48 h PI led to expression of the full range of lytic genes (25Krishnan H.H. Naranatt P.P. Smith M.S. Zeng L. Bloomer C. Chandran B. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3601-3620Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Thus, there are actually two distinct phases when ORF50 may be expressed in HMVEC-d cells: (i) during early stages of primary infection (TPA-independent) and (ii) when TPA is added to cells that are harboring virus DNA in a predominantly latent phase (TPA-dependent). Hence, we infected the above siRNA-transfected cells with KSHV (multiplicity of infection of 10 ORF73 units). After 6 h PI, ORF50 expression in the cells was monitored by qRT-PCR. This study monitored the expression of ORF50 during the early phase of primary infection. Cells transfected with siRNA specific to Egr-1 expressed reduced levels of ORF50 when compared with cells transfected with siRNA specific to VEGF or with NS siRNA or those left untransfected (Fig. 2C). This siRNA-specific decrease in the expression of ORF50 was significantly reversed when the cells were co-transfected with siRNA specific to egr-1 and 500 ng of egr-1/pCDNA3.1(+) plasmid compared with transfecting cells with siRNA specific to Egr-1 and 500 ng of pCDNA3.1(+) (Fig. 2C). Co-transfecting cells with gL/pCDNA3.1(+) did not reverse the inhibitory effect of siRNA specific to Egr-1 on ORF50 (data not shown). These results demonstrate the specific and crucial role for Egr-1 in the expression of Rta, the initiator of KSHV reactivation (37Sun R. Lin S.F. Staskus K. Gradoville L. Grogan E. Haase A. Miller G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2232-2242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TPA-induced KSHV-infected cells that were transfected with siRNA specific to Egr-1 expressed reduced levels of ORF50 when compared with cells transfected with siRNA specific to VEGF"
https://openalex.org/W1996554354,"The ability to express phenotypically plastic responses to environmental cues might be adaptive in changing environments. We studied phenotypic plasticity in mating behaviour as a response to population density and adult sex ratio in a freshwater isopod (Asellus aquaticus). A. aquaticus has recently diverged into two distinct ecotypes, inhabiting different lake habitats (reed Phragmites australis and stonewort Chara tomentosa, respectively). In field surveys, we found that these habitats differ markedly in isopod population densities and adult sex ratios. These spatially and temporally demographic differences are likely to affect mating behaviour. We performed behavioural experiments using animals from both the ancestral ecotype (“reed” isopods) and from the novel ecotype (“stonewort” isopods) population. We found that neither ecotype adjusted their behaviour in response to population density. However, the reed ecotype had a higher intrinsic mating propensity across densities. In contrast to the effects of density, we found ecotype differences in plasticity in response to sex ratio. The stonewort ecotype show pronounced phenotypic plasticity in mating propensity to adult sex ratio, whereas the reed ecotype showed a more canalised behaviour with respect to this demographic factor. We suggest that the lower overall mating propensity and the phenotypic plasticity in response to sex ratio have evolved in the novel stonewort ecotype following invasion of the novel habitat. Plasticity in mating behaviour may in turn have effects on the direction and intensity of sexual selection in the stonewort habitat, which may fuel further ecotype divergence."
https://openalex.org/W2083219604,"Background Mathematical models have shown to be extremely helpful in understanding the dynamics of different virus diseases, including hepatitis B. Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is a satellite virus of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). In the liver, production of new HDV virions depends on the presence of HBV. There are two ways in which HDV can occur in an individual: co-infection and super-infection. Co-infection occurs when an individual is simultaneously infected by HBV and HDV, while super-infection occurs in persons with an existing chronic HBV infection. Methodology/Principal Findings In this work a mathematical model based on differential equations is proposed for the viral dynamics of the hepatitis D virus (HDV) across different scenarios. This model takes into consideration the knowledge of the biology of the virus and its interaction with the host. In this work we will present the results of a simulation study where two scenarios were considered, co-infection and super-infection, together with different antiviral therapies. Although, in general the predicted course of HDV infection is similar to that observed for HBV, we observe a faster increase in the number of HBV infected cells and viral load. In most tested scenarios, the number of HDV infected cells and viral load values remain below corresponding predicted values for HBV. Conclusions/Significance The simulation study shows that, under the most commonly used and generally accepted therapy approaches for HDV infection, such as lamivudine (LMV) or ribavirine, peggylated alpha-interferon (IFN) or a combination of both, LMV monotherapy and combination therapy of LMV and IFN were predicted to more effectively reduce the HBV and HDV viral loads in the case of super-infection scenarios when compared with the co-infection. In contrast, IFN monotherapy was found to reduce the HDV viral load more efficiently in the case of super-infection while the effect on the HBV viral load was more pronounced during co-infection. The results suggest that there is a need for development of high efficacy therapeutic approaches towards the specific inhibition of HDV replication. These approaches may additionally be directed to the reduction of the half-life of infected cells and life-span of newly produced circulating virions."
https://openalex.org/W2076450795,"Cytokinesis is a fundamental cellular process, which ensures equal abscission and fosters diploid progenies. Aberrant cytokinesis may result in genomic instability and cell transformation. However, the underlying regulatory machinery of cytokinesis is largely undefined. Here, we demonstrate that Nlp (Ninein-like protein), a recently identified BRCA1-associated centrosomal protein that is required for centrosomes maturation at interphase and spindle formation in mitosis, also contributes to the accomplishment of cytokinesis. Through immunofluorescent analysis, Nlp is found to localize at midbody during cytokinesis. Depletion of endogenous Nlp triggers aborted division and subsequently leads to multinucleated phenotypes. Nlp can be recruited by Aurora B to the midbody apparatus via their physical association at the late stage of mitosis. Disruption of their interaction induces aborted cytokinesis. Importantly, Nlp is characterized as a novel substrate of Aurora B and can be phosphorylated by Aurora B. The specific phosphorylation sites are mapped at Ser-185, Ser-448, and Ser-585. The phosphorylation at Ser-448 and Ser-585 is likely required for Nlp association with Aurora B and localization at midbody. Meanwhile, the phosphorylation at Ser-185 is vital to Nlp protein stability. Disruptions of these phosphorylation sites abolish cytokinesis and lead to chromosomal instability.

Collectively, these observations demonstrate that regulation of Nlp by Aurora B is critical for the completion of cytokinesis, providing novel insights into understanding the machinery of cell cycle progression. Cytokinesis is the final step of cell division by which the daughter nuclei and cytoplasm are separated completely and produce diploid progenies (1Scholey J.M. Brust-Mascher I. Mogilner A. Nature. 2003; 422: 746-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). During this process, a group of anti-parallel microtubules form the midbody apparatus to deliver signals and work as a framework for regulatory protein anchoring (2D'Avino P.P. Savoian M.S. Glover D.M. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1549-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Numerous proteins, such as PRC1, MKLP1, and BRUC (3Jiang W. Jimenez G. Wells N.J. Hope T.J. Wahl G.M.

All of these proteins are recruited to the midbody during cytokinesis, activate downstream signal pathways to lead to actin polymerization and myosin activation, and then create shearing force to separate the cleavage furrow (6Guertin D.A. Trautmann S. McCollum D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 155-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 7Glotzer M.

Abnormal cytokinesis can induce defects in cell separation and accumulation of nuclei in polyploidy cells and then promote cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. Aurora B is an important phosphokinase in mammalian cells. Together with the inner centromere protein (INCENP) 2The abbreviations used are: INCENPinner centromere proteinTRITCtetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. and survivin, it composes the chromosome passenger complex and has been implicated in multiple mitotic events, especially in the regulation of cell division (8Vader G. Medema R.H. Lens S.M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 9Vernos I. Dev.

Aurora B moves from centromeres to the midzone spindle at anaphase and to the midbody at telophase and cytokinesis. As the unique kinase center of chromosome passenger complex, the activity of Aurora B is crucial for the functions of the complex, which depend on Aurora B phosphorylation of its substrates at proper time in corresponding cell cycle phases (8Vader G. Medema R.H. Lens S.M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Several substrates of Aurora B have already been identified, such as MKLP1 and MgcRacGAP (10Meraldi P. Honda R. Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In the phase of cytokinesis, Aurora B just locates at midbody and recruits important molecules for cytokinesis signal transmission (11Minoshima Y. Kawashima T. Hirose K. Tonozuka Y. Kawajiri A. Bao Y.C. Deng X. Tatsuka M. Narumiya S. May Jr., W.S. Nosaka T. Semba K. Inoue T. Satoh T. Inagaki M. Kitamura T. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 549-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Aurora B is required for ensuring the correct assembly of the midzone and midbody microtubules (24Murata-Hori M. Wang Y.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, several cytoskeletal proteins are phosphorylated by Aurora B for cytokinesis. Goto et al. (12Goto H.

Nlp is a recently identified BRCA1-associated centrosomal protein (28Jin S. Gao H. Mazzacurati L. Wang Y. Fan W. Chen Q. Yu W. Wang M. Zhu X. Zhang C. Zhan Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22970-22977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which was tethered to the interphasic centrosome by the tumor suppressor BRCA1. Such interaction is required for the maintenance of Nlp centrosomal localization and protein stability, which ensures centrosome maturation and spindle formation. Depletion of endogenous Nlp via siRNA hindered bipolar spindle formation and triggered chromosomal missegregation (28Jin S. Gao H. Mazzacurati L. Wang Y. Fan W. Chen Q. Yu W. Wang M. Zhu X. Zhang C. Zhan Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22970-22977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Significantly, several lines of evidence have linked Nlp to human cancers. Deregulated expression of Nlp is found in diverse human primary cancers and tumor-derived cell lines, typically breast, lung, ovarian, and head and neck cancer, which is in part coupled with NLP gene amplification (31Shao S.

Overexpression of Nlp is able to transform NIH3T3 fibroblasts in vitro and initiate tumor formation in nude mice. Consistently, Nlp transgenic mice display spontaneous tumorigenesis in the breast, ovary, and testicle and showed more rapid onset of radiation-induced lymphoma. Therefore, Nlp may be a potential oncogenic protein in tumorigenesis (31Shao S. Liu R. Wang Y. Song Y. Zuo L. Xue L. Lu N. Hou N. Wang M. Yang X. Zhan Q. J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 498-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It has been previously reported by Casenghi et al. (13Casenghi M. Meraldi P. Weinhart U. Duncan P.I. Körner R. Nigg E.A. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 113-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) that Nlp is a γ-tubulin-binding protein and involves centrosome maturation and microtubule nucleation. During interphase, Nlp is transported to the centrosome by the dynein-dynactin motor complex and then contributes to the attachment and nucleation of microtubules (14Casenghi M. Barr F.A. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5101-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Additionally, the phosphorylation of centrosomal Nlp by Plk1 upon entry into mitosis, followed by displacement from the centrosome, is a prerequisite for correct spindle formation (13Casenghi M. Meraldi P. Weinhart U. Duncan P.I. Körner R. Nigg E.A. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 113-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 28Jin S. Gao H. Mazzacurati L. Wang Y. Fan W.

In mammalian cells, Nlp is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner with a peak at G2/M transition. Further analysis has indicated that Nlp is a relatively short half-life protein and can be ubiquitinated via the anaphase-promoting cyclosome complex pathway (15Wang Y. Zhan Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17712-17719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, both yeast two-hybrid and biochemical evidences strongly suggest Nlp as a physiological substrate of several essential mitotic kinases, including Plk1, Nek2, and Cdc2 (13Casenghi M. Meraldi P. Weinhart U. Duncan P.I. Körner R. Nigg E.A. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 113-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 14Casenghi M. Barr F.A. Nigg E.A. J.

Ther., in press.Google Scholar) Coordinated phosphorylation of Nlp by these kinases facilitate its dissociation from the centrosome, which is a critical step for centrosome maturation, spindle assembly, and chromosome segregation (14Casenghi M. Barr F.A. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5101-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Apparently, phosphorylation plays a key role in the regulatory machineries of Nlp for proper execution of sequential fundamental mitotic events and cell cycle progression. In this study, we demonstrate that Nlp is involved in the final events of cell cleavage. Depletion of Nlp perturbs proper cytokinesis and fosters multinucleation. Interestingly, Nlp is recruited to the midbody and phosphorylated by Aurora B during cytokinesis. Such phosphorylation is not only involved in recruiting Nlp to the midbody but also stabilizes Nlp during cytokinesis. These findings suggest that the modulation of Nlp by Aurora B might be vital to the commitment of cytokinesis and maintenance of genomic stability. Anti-GFP, Aurora B, γ-tubulin, and ubiquitin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phosphohistone H3.1 antibody was from Bioworld (GeneLinx International, Inc.). FITC/TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse/rabbit antibodies were from Zhongshan (Zhongshan Goldenbridge Biotechnology, Co., Ltd., China). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Nlp antibody was produced by MBL (Beijing B&M Biotech Co., Ltd., China). DAPI was purchased from Sigma and High Technology Corp. HeLa cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrom Ltd.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide. HeLa cells overexpressing wild type or mutant GFP-Nlp were grown in selective medium (RPMI 1640 medium with G418 at a concentration of 400 μg/ml). To synchronize cells at G2/M phase, cells were treated with 400 ng/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for 16 h and then changed to fresh RPMI 1640 medium until harvest. To extract cellular proteins, cells were collected, rinsed with PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer. The Western blotting assays were performed as described before (26Ji J. Liu R. Tong T. Song Y. Jin S. Wu M. Zhan Q. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 6396-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To make Aurora B expression vector, human Aurora B coding regions were amplified using the High Fidelity PCR system. To create Nlp site-directed mutations, Muta-directTM mutagenesis kit (SBS Genetech Co., China) was used with pEGFP-Nlp as template. For transient transfection, 5 μg of DNA and 10 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were used. After being incubated for 6 h, the medium was changed with fresh RPMI 1640 medium. Cells were harvested or fixed at 24 or 48 h after transfection. Expression and extraction of GST fusion proteins were performed as described previously (26Ji J. Liu R. Tong T. Song Y. Jin S. Wu M. Zhan Q. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 6396-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For pulldown experiments, the purified GST fusion proteins (conjugated with glutathione-agarose beads) were incubated with 1 mg of cell lysate at 4 °C overnight. After washing the beads with PBS, the pulldown complexes were analyzed by Western blotting analysis. For immunoprecipitation experiments, 1 mg of cellular proteins was first incubated with 10 μl of special antibodies at 4 °C for 6 h, and then 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads was added and incubated at 4 °C for 6 h. After centrifugation, the precipitated complexes were analyzed by Western blotting assay. Fixed cells were incubated with the indicated antibodies and then probed with TRITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse/rabbit IgG. DNA was stained with DAPI. Cells were visualized by an Olympus fluorescent microscope. For observing the co-localization of distinct proteins, a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems Heidelberg GmbH, Am Friedensplatz 3, Germany) was used to visualize the cells. Aurora B kinase assay was performed as follows: 1–5 μg of GST fusion proteins were incubated with 20 ng of active Aurora B kinase (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and 5 μl of magnesium/ATP mixture (75 mm MgCl2, 500 μm ATP in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The reaction system was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and stopped the by adding 2× protein loading buffer. The phosphorylated GST fusion proteins were run on a polyacrylamide gel. Polyacrylamide gels were dried using a vacuum dryer and exposed to x-ray films under −70 °C for 2 h. The Nlp siRNA sequence was designed as 5′-GUGAGUCUUGAGGAAUUCC)d(TT)-3′ and 5′-CAUGUAGAUUUGAGAGAGA)d(TT)-3′. The Aurora B siRNA sequence was designed as 5′-CAGCCACGAUCAUGGAGGATTUCCUCCAUGUCGUGGCUGTT)d(TT)-3′ and 5′-GGUGAUGGAGAAUAGCAGUTTACUGCUAUUCUCCAUCACCTT)d(TT)-3′. The nonspecific siRNA (control) sequence was designed as 5′-AUUGUAUGCGAUCGCAGAC)d(TT)-3′. These sequences do not match any other sequences in the GenBankTM. To further explore the functions of Nlp in regulation of cell cycle progression, HeLa cells overexpressing GFP-Nlp were first established. Using an immunofluorescent approach, the localization of GFP-Nlp was found to be dynamic according to cell cycle progression. In this experiment, different phases of the cell cycle were discriminated by special nuclear phenotypes. As shown in Fig. 1A, GFP-Nlp was localized at centrosomes at the beginning of the mitotic phase and then displaced when cells passed into anaphase. Until telophase and cytokinesis when daughter cells were linked only by a narrow cytoplasmic bridge, GFP-Nlp was clearly seen in a double-band region of the midbody. To investigate whether Nlp is involved in cytokinesis, specific Nlp siRNA was used to inhibit the expression of Nlp. The interfering results were examined through RT-PCR and Western blot assays (Fig. 1B). When endogenous Nlp in cells was depressed, several abnormal nuclear phenotypes were observed, including giant nuclear (the nuclear material is much more than normal ones), micronuclear (there is small nuclear material besides the forming nucleus), and multinuclear phenotypes (one cell contains two or more well distributed nuclei) (Fig. 1C). Following the treatment with Nlp siRNA, a number of cells displayed multiple nuclei (Fig. 1D, white arrows). Statistical analysis in three independent experiments showed that the percentage of multinuclear cells in Nlp-depleted teams were about 25%, which was much more than control (Fig. 1E). Because one of the important phenotypes in cytokinesis failure cells is multinucleation (30Eggert U.S. Mitchison T.J. Field C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 543-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), we assumed that Nlp may function as an important factor in the process of cytokinesis. As mentioned above, Aurora B is important for mitosis and cytokinesis, and its subcellular location is cell cycle-dependent. Through immunofluorescent staining, we confirmed that during the progression of mitosis, Aurora B moved from chromatin to the midzone and finally located at the midbody during cytokinesis (Fig. 2A). At the same time, we also found that Nlp was co-localized with Aurora B at the midbody (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Fig. S1A). These observations suggested an interaction between Nlp and Aurora B. Through immunoprecipitation assays with anti-GFP and anti-Aurora B antibodies, we found that Aurora B, GFP-Nlp, and INCENP could be detected in the precipitated complexes (Fig. 2C, top panels). Additionally, the GST-pulldown assay also showed that Nlp was precipitated by GST-Aurora B (Fig. 2C, bottom panels). The physical interaction of endogenous Nlp with Aurora B was further corroborated by antibodies against Nlp and Aurora B through co-immunoprecipitation in HCT116 cells. Apparently, the endogenous Nlp could be immunoprecipitated by Aurora B and vice versa (supplemental Fig. S1B). Collectively, these results indicate that Nlp physically interacts with Aurora B. However, using immunofluorescent microscopy, we found that co-localization of Nlp and Aurora B was not throughout the whole cell cycle but only in the final stage of cell division (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that the interaction of Nlp and Aurora B might be cell cycle-dependent. To confirm this hypothesis, nocodazole (mitotic inhibitor) was employed to synchronize cells at G2/M phase. After releasing into fresh medium, most of cells were synchronized in the same stage of mitosis. According to the protein level of cyclins (cyclin A, B1, D, and E1), the mitotic stages of the cell cycle was well defined (Fig. 2D). Following synchronization, the immunoprecipitation assay with anti-GFP antibody was performed. We found that the level of precipitated Aurora B protein was elevated according to the process of mitosis and cytokinesis (Fig. 2E). Normalizing to the precipitated GFP-Nlp in the same complexes, the precipitated Aurora B in the stage of cytokinesis was much more than that seen at the beginning of mitosis (Fig. 2F). This evidence suggests that interaction of Nlp with Aurora B mostly happened in cytokinesis. To investigate whether Nlp is phosphorylated by Aurora B, kinase assay was performed. As shown in Fig. 3A, the amino acid fragments 162–250, 361–490, and 490–590 of Nlp exhibited obvious phosphorylation in the presence of Aurora B. Generally, it is believe that Aurora B targets its substrates at special sites ((R/K)1–3X(S/T)) (10Meraldi P. Honda R. Nigg E.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Through sequence analysis, we found three conserved phosphorylating sites (Ser-185, Ser-448, and Ser-585) in these positive fragments. To confirm the phosphorylating sites, Ser-185, Ser-448, and Ser-585 were mutated to nonphosphorylatable alanines by site-directed mutagenesis, respectively. The Aurora B kinase assay showed that compared with wild type fragments, the phosphorylation of those site-mutated fragments was abolished (Fig. 3B). These data indicate that Nlp is phosphorylated by Aurora B at the sites of Ser-185, Ser-448, and Ser-585. To explore the significance of Nlp phosphorylation by Aurora B in cytokinesis, ZM447439, a specific selective ATP-competitive inhibitor of Aurora B kinase (16Girdler F. Gascoigne K.E. Eyers P.A. Hartmuth S. Crafter C. Foote K.M. Keen N.J. Taylor S.S. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3664-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), was employed to inhibit the activity of Aurora B in the experiments. First of all, histone H3, an identified substrate of Aurora B, was examined to detect the kinase activity of Aurora B in this assay. Immunoblotting assay with anti-phosphorylated histone H3 antibody showed that after cells were treated by ZM447439 for 4 h, the level of phosphorylated histone H3 was substantially reduced (Fig. 4A), indicating that treatment with ZM447439 resulted in inhibition of Aurora B kinase activity. Next, we performed immunofluorescent assay and found that following inhibition of Aurora B cells displayed abnormal nuclear phenotypes (Fig. 4B). Most of nuclei were not divided completely. There were a number of multinuclear cells that emerged (red arrows shown in Fig. 4B) and multipolar spindles (white arrow showed in Fig. 4B). In addition, after suppression of Aurora B activity, GFP-Nlp diffused widely in the cytoplasm, and none of cells in the cytoplasmic dividing phase were found (red arrows in Fig. 4B). Similar results were also obtained in cells treated with siRNA. After HeLa cells overexpressing GFP-Nlp were treated with Aurora B siRNA (siAurora B), the endogenous Aurora B protein was substantially suppressed (Fig. 4C). Through immunofluorescent staining and laser-scanning confocal examination, we observed that GFP-Nlp aggregated into large assemblies and dispersed into the cytoplasm following suppression of Aurora B by siRNA approach (red arrows showed in Fig. 4D). Additionally, abnormal nuclear types (multiple nuclei, giant nuclei, and micro-nuclei) were also seen in cells treated with Aurora B siRNA (white arrows in Fig. 4D and supplemental Fig. S2). These results indicate that Aurora B is required for the normal localizations of Nlp in cytokinesis. The analyses of the bioinformatics showed that Nlp contains three coiled-coil motifs (470–570, 620–699, and 1046–1322 amino acids), which are thought of as the functional motifs for protein-protein interactions (27Burkhard P. Stetefeld J. Strelkov S.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). To determine which part of Nlp was essential for interaction with Aurora B, we constructed three Myc-tagged Nlp deletions (1–370, 361–830, and 1030–1381 amino acids) expressing vectors in which coiled-coil motifs were included (Fig. 4E). Through the immunoprecipitation assay with anti-Myc antibody, we found that the fragments covering 361–830 and 1030–1381 amino acids were able to precipitate Aurora B (Fig. 4F). Similar results were obtained in HEK293T cells expressing these Myc-tagged Nlp deletion mutants (data not shown). Because the phosphorylation sites of Ser-448 and Ser-585 are located only in the interacting positive fragment (361–830 amino acids), we presumed phosphorylations at these two sites might mediate the interaction of Nlp and Aurora B. To prove this hypothesis, Ser-448 and Ser-585 were replaced with nonphosphorylatable alanines. Through immunoprecipitation assays with anti-GFP antibody, we found that the double-site mutant of GFP-Nlp was not able to precipitate Aurora B (Fig. 4G), which indicates that Ser-448 and Ser-585 are required for Nlp interacting with Aurora B. We also transfected Nlp mutant expression vector with Ser-448 and Ser-585 double-site mutations into cells, and we found that the expression of such a mutant Nlp protein led to multinuclear formation. In parallel, Nlp was not located at midbody but diffused throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 4H). Thus, it appears that the localization of Nlp at midbody is dependent on its interaction with Aurora B. It has been previously reported by Wang et al. (15Wang Y. Zhan Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17712-17719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) that Nlp is a short lived protein, and its degradation is regulated by anaphase-promoting cyclosome complex-mediated ubiquitination. We further examined whether phosphorylation on Nlp could affect its degradation. In this experiment, ZM447439 was employed to inhibit the kinase activity of Aurora B. We synchronized cells with nocodazole and used cycloheximide to block protein synthesis. Immunoblotting assay showed that when cells were treated with ZM447439, Nlp degraded much faster than the cells treated with DMSO (Fig. 5A). Following suppression of Aurora B activity, the protein level of Nlp remained only 40% compared with that seen in control cells (Fig. 5B). To further investigate the role of phosphorylation in Nlp ubiquitination, we performed immunoprecipitation assay in cells transfected with different expression vectors (WT, GFP-Nlp; M185, mutation in Ser-185; DM, double mutations in Ser-448 and Ser-585; and TM, triple mutations in Ser-185, Ser-448, and Ser-585) and found that the ubiquitination levels of the Ser-185 mutant and the triple-site mutant were much higher than double-site mutant and wild type (Fig. 5C). These findings suggest that phosphorylation at Ser-185 might play a role in the ubiquitination of Nlp. We also compared the protein degradation of wild type Nlp and mutant Nlp with mutation in Ser-185. HeLa cells overexpressing wild type or Ser-185-mutated GFP-Nlp were synchronized in late mitotic phase by nocodazole, treated with cycloheximide, and followed by immunoblotting assay. Consistently, degradation of Ser-185 mutant Nlp was much faster than wild type Nlp (Fig. 5D), suggesting that phosphorylation at Ser-185 by Aurora B might stabilize Nlp during the phase of cytokinesis. As reported by Casenghi et al. (13Casenghi M. Meraldi P. Weinhart U. Duncan P.I. Körner R. Nigg E.A. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 113-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), Nlp is a candidate γ-tubulin-binding protein, which interacts with γ-tubulin and stimulates microtubule nucleation. We then examined whether Aurora B regulates the interaction of Nlp with γ-tubulin. Immunoprecipitation assay showed that GFP-Nlp could still precipitate γ-tubulin when the activity of Aurora B was inhibited (Fig. 6A). Furthermore, HeLa cells were transfected with wild type GFP-Nlp, Ser-185 mutant, Ser-448 and Ser-585 double-site mutant, or Ser-185 and Ser-448 and Ser-585 triple-site mutant vectors, respectively, and immunoprecipitation assays were performed with anti-GFP antibody. As showed in Fig. 6B, all the Nlp mutants were still able to precipitate γ-tubulin, regardless of inhibition of Aurora B kinase activity. These results further confirm that phosphorylation of Nlp by Aurora B does not perturb the interaction between Nlp and γ-tubulin at midbody. Interestingly, we found that Nlp and γ-tubulin not only interacted on centrosomes during interphase, but also co-localized at the midbody during cytokinesis (Fig. 6C, white arrow). These observations indicate the necessity for the recruitment of Nlp by Aurora B to the midbody to transiently stimulate microtubule nucleation with γ-tubulin. As a platform, Nlp can coordinately organize γ-tubulin and other unidentified elements to maintain the stability of the midbody apparatus (Fig. 7A). The process of cell division is divided into two consecutive steps as follows: nuclear division and plasmatic division, both of which are critical for chromosome stability of daughter cells. Any aberrations of these procedures will lead to chromosome instability and then result in the formation of heteroploidy cells, which is closely associated with cell transformation and tumorigenesis (17Jefford C.E. Irminger-Finger I. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 2006; 59: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, the machinery of controlling cytokinesis is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrated that Nlp plays an important role in cytokinesis, which is regulated by mitotic kinase Aurora B. RNAi-mediated depletion of Nlp perturbs the process of cytokinesis and leads to heteroploidy. In cells with experimentally exhausting endogenous Nlp, we observed three kinds of aberrant nuclear phenotypes, including giant nuclear, micronuclear, and multinuclear phenotypes (Fig. 1C). It is well accepted that there are several possible mechanisms that contribute to the formation of heteroploidy cells, including dysfunction of mitotic spindles, partial inactivation of mitotic proteins, and failure of cytokinesis (18Storchova Z. Pellman D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 19King R.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1786: 4-14PubMed Google Scholar). For those giant nuclear and micronuclear cells, the daughter nuclei have not divided or separated abnormally, which are caused by defects of spindle formation and unsuccessful chromosomal segregation. For those multinuclear cells, all the nuclei demarcated completely, indicating the process of nuclear division was faultless. However, the phenotype with several nuclei held in one cell indicates that there are faults in the process of cytoplasmic division, in which the complete daughter nuclei were unable to separate equally but gathering together to form polyploidy cells. Therefore, formation of multinuclear cells might be mainly due to aborted cytokinesis. Cytokinesis is the final stage of cell division in which a critical architecture, the midbody apparatus, must be formed to fulfill this cellular process. Midbody is a narrow tubular intercellular bridge that consists of tightly bundled anti-parallel microtubules, but the origin of these microtubule bundles is largely unknown. According to the observations by Shu et al. (20Shu H.B. Li Z. Palacios M.J. Li Q. Joshi H.C. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2955-2962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Julian et al. (21Julian M. Tollon Y. Lajoie-Mazenc I. Moisand A. Mazarguil H. Puget A. Wright M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 145-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), γ-tubulins transiently present at midbody and act as a transient microtubule organizing center for the midbody formation. Piel et al. (22Piel M. Nordburg J. Euteneuer U. Burnens M. Science. 2001; 291: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) have also reported that during cytokinesis the centrosomes transiently appear at midbody, which is necessary for completion of cytoplasmic division. All these observations suggest the necessity of a transient microtubule organizing center for the midbody formation. In this study, we found a co-localization of γ-tubulin and Nlp at midbody in the phase of cytokinesis (Fig. 6C). Significantly, phosphorylation of Nlp by Aurora B does not affect its interaction with γ-tubulin at midbody (Fig. 6B). When Nlp expression interfered, midbody formation was disrupted and multinuclear cells substantially increased, indicating that Nlp is one of the key components involved in control of cytokinesis. Thus, we presume that Nlp may work as a platform that coordinately organizes γ-tubulin and other unidentified microtubule-associated proteins to maintain the stability of the midbody apparatus and ensure the commitment of cytokinesis (Fig. 7A). Aurora B is one of the most notable proteins for regulation of cytokinesis and involved in the formation of midbody (23Giet R. Glover D.M. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 669-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Depletion of Aurora B induces failure of cytokinesis and results in polyploidy cells (24Murata-Hori M. Wang Y.L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Similarly, we found that when activity of Aurora B was suppressed by ZM447439, or expression of Aurora B protein was directly blocked via siRNA approach, the offspring nuclei did not separate completely (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. S2), and even multipolar spindles emerged (Fig. 4B, white arrow). In the cells depleted of Aurora B, GFP-Nlp was unable to localize in the midzone between daughter cells but aggregated into large assemblies and dispersed widely into cytoplasm, and none of the cells could organize the midbody apparatus. All these results suggest that recruitment of Nlp to the midbody by Aurora B is necessary for cytokinesis. The biological functions of Nlp in centrosome maturation and spindle formation have been reported to be regulated by several important protein kinases such as Plk1, Nek2, and Cdc2 (25Rapley J. Baxter J.E. Blot J. Wattam S.L. Casenghi M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. Fry A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 1309-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 34Zhao, X.Jin, S.Song, M.Zhan, Q. (2010) Cancer Biol. Ther., in press.Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that Aurora B is able to phosphorylate Nlp and regulate its function in cytokinesis. Through kinase assays and other biochemical approaches, we have mapped three specific phosphorylation sites at Ser-185, Ser-448, and Ser-585 in Nlp. Significantly, the phosphorylations of Nlp at the three sites by Aurora B may have two distinct functions (Fig. 7B). First, phosphorylations at Ser-448 and Ser-585 might be required for interaction of Nlp with Aurora B. Mutations at these two sites disrupt the localization of Nlp at the midbody and result in impaired cytokinesis (Fig. 4H). Second, phosphorylation at Ser-185 of Nlp is of considerable importance, not only stabilizing the recruitment of Nlp signal by Aurora B but also ensuring no premature destruction of Nlp before completion of cytokinesis. Nlp has recently been characterized as a short life protein, and its degradation is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (15Wang Y. Zhan Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17712-17719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that phosphorylation on Ser-185 affects ubiquitination of Nlp and stabilizes the protein and in turn ensures its function in cytokinesis. Thus, Nlp functions as a novel substrate of Aurora B and mediates its role in the control of cytokinesis. Nlp expression is cell cycle-dependent (15Wang Y. Zhan Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17712-17719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and its expression is dynamic in mitosis and cytokinesis. A delicate level of Nlp is required for the “healthy” mitotic progression. Deregulated expression of Nlp is closely associated with chromosomal instability and malignant transformation (28Jin S. Gao H. Mazzacurati L. Wang Y. Fan W. Chen Q. Yu W. Wang M. Zhu X. Zhang C. Zhan Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22970-22977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The findings in this study (Fig. 1, C–E) further confirm that depletion of Nlp function results in multiple nuclei and aneuploidy. Recently, we have found that there are abnormal expressions and gene amplifications of NLP (KIAA0980) in clinical human cancers, and overexpression of Nlp induces anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenicity in both cell and animal models. We have also observed centrosome amplification and spontaneous tumors in Nlp transgenic mice (31Shao S. Liu R. Wang Y. Song Y. Zuo L. Xue L. Lu N. Hou N. Wang M. Yang X. Zhan Q. J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 498-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thus, deregulated levels of Nlp would result in genomic instability and tumorigenesis. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the centrosomal protein Nlp interacts with Aurora B and is phosphorylated by Aurora B, especially during cytokinesis. Prominently, Aurora B regulation of Nlp is required for cytokinesis and plays a role in maintaining chromosome stability. These observations provide novel insights into understanding the molecular mechanism(s) involved in the control of cell cycle progression and cell division.

https://openalex.org/W2110191768,"Background Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a highly aggressive disease with poor prognosis, which frequently exhibits HER-2 gene amplification. Trastuzumab, the humanized antibody against HER-2, has potent growth inhibitory effects on HER-2 overexpressing cancers. One effect of trastuzumab is that it causes HER-2 receptor internalization and degradation, enhancing presentation of HER-2 epitopes on MHC-Class I molecules. This enhances the ability of HER-2 specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) to recognize and kill cancer cells. Novel strategies targeting the HER-2 receptor either directly by trastuzumab and/or indirectly by inducing a CTL response against HER-2 epitopes with, for instance, DC immunotherapy and consequently combining these strategies might prove to be very effective. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we report that trastuzumab has potent growth inhibitory effects on two HER-2 overexpressing EAC cell lines OE33 and OE19. However, we found that trastuzumab and HER-2 specific CTLs act synergistically in inducing tumor lysis in OE33 but not in OE19. We discovered that in OE19 this deficient response is due to a down-regulation of the Transporter Associated with Antigen Processing-2 (TAP-2). TAP-2 is an important member of the Antigen Processing Machinery (APM), and is one of the essential elements for loading antigens on MHC class I molecules. Importantly, we demonstrated that by inducing re-expression of TAP-2 in OE19 with INF-γ treatment or by incubating the cells with INF-γ producing CTLs, the specific anti HER-2 CTL tumor lysis response and synergistic effect with trastuzumab can be restored. Conclusion An inefficient response of HER-2 overexpressing EAC to trastuzumab and/or DC immunotherapy can be due to a down-regulated TAP-2 expression and thus a deficient APM. Future studies combining trastuzumab with IFN-γ and/or immune-therapies inducing potent anti HER-2 CTL responses could lead to an effective combinatorial strategy for successful treatment of HER-2 overexpressing but APM defective cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2046889976,"Earlier studies identified serglycin proteoglycan and its heparin chains to be important for storage and activity of mast cell proteases. However, the importance of serglycin for secretion and activity of mast cell proteases in response to parasite infection has been poorly investigated. To address this issue, we studied the effects on mast cell proteases in serglycin-deficient and wild type mice after peritoneal infection with the obligate intracellular parasite Toxoplasma gondii. In line with previous results, we found severely reduced levels of cell-bound mast cell proteases in both noninfected and infected serglycin-deficient mice. However, serglycin-deficient mice secreted mast cell proteases at wild type levels at the site of infection, and enzymatic activities associated with mast cell proteases were equally up-regulated in wild type and serglycin-deficient mice 48 h after infection. In both wild type and serglycin-deficient mice, parasite infection resulted in highly increased extracellular levels of glycosaminoglycans, including hyaluronan and chondroitin sulfate A, suggesting a role of these substances in the general defense mechanism. In contrast, heparan sulfate/heparin was almost undetectable in serglycin-deficient mice, and in wild type mice, it was mainly confined to the cellular fraction and was not increased upon infection. Furthermore, the heparan sulfate/heparin population was less sulfated in serglycin-deficient than in wild type mice indicative for the absence of heparin, which supports that heparin production is dependent on the serglycin core protein. Together, our results suggest that serglycin proteoglycan is dispensable for normal secretion and activity of mast cell proteases in response to peritoneal infection with T. gondii."

Some of the core complex components also form distinct subcomplexes among themselves or with factors outside the core complex (3de Winter J.P. Joenje H. Mutat.

In the present study, we show that FANCA and FANCC form a cytoplasmic subcomplex, which interacts with and stabilizes the leukemic nucleophosmin (NPM). Mutation of the NPM gene in exon 12 creates a nuclear export signal and generates an aberrantly cytoplasm-dislocalized NPM (NPMc) protein, which has been identified in ∼35% of adult patients and 6.5% of children with AML (10Falini B. Mecucci C. Tiacci E. Alcalay M. Rosati R. Pasqualucci L. La Starza R. Diverio D. Colombo E. Santucci A. Bigerna B. Pacini R. Pucciarini A. Liso A. Vigetti M. Fazi P. Meani N. Pettirossi V. Saglio G.

Ther. 2009; 9: 1283-1294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic mutated NPMc is generally associated with a subset of AML characteristic of a normal karyotype and clinically a better response to chemotherapy and a favorable prognosis (11Meani N. Alcalay M. Expert Rev. Anticancer. Ther. 2009; 9: 1283-1294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Pasqualucci L. Liso A. Martelli M.P. Bolli N. Pacini R. Tabarrini A. Carini M. Bigerna B. Pucciarini A. Mannucci R. Nicoletti I. Tiacci E. Meloni G. Specchia G. Cantore N. Di Raimondo F. Pileri S. Mecucci C. Mandelli F. Martelli M.F. Falini B. Blood. 2006; 108: 4146-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We performed sequence analysis of BM samples from 46 FA patients and found that NPMc mutations were excluded from FA patients. Significantly, our study indicates that the cytoplasmic FANCA-FANCC subcomplex is required for the stability of the leukemic NPMc. A total of 46 FA BM samples were obtained from the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) Fanconi Anemia Comprehensive Care Center in accordance to guidelines from the Institutional Review Board of CCHMC (IRB protocol 2008-1644). A total of 37 AML samples including 28 AML primary patient samples and 9 AML cell lines were included for the study. The AML patient samples were obtained at the time of diagnosis from the University of Chicago Medical Center in accordance to guidelines from the Institutional Review Board of University of Chicago (IRB protocol 6609). Genomic DNA from each cell line and bone marrow sample was extracted by using a DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. NPMc mutation analysis was performed as described previously (13Falini B. Martelli M.P. Mecucci C. Liso A. Bolli N. Bigerna B. Pucciarini A. Pileri S. Meloni G. Martelli M.F. Haferlach T. Schnittger S. Hematologica. 2008; 93: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All PCR products were purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit and directly sequenced. All sequences were compared with the GenBank NPM cDNA sequence. The HSC 536 lymphoblasts and OCI/AML3 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 10 units/ml penicillin, 10 µg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Cells were treated with cyclohexamide (CX; 10 µg/ml), doxycycline (Dox; 15–40 ng/ml), MG132 (25 µm), or etoposide (40 µm), and harvested at indicated time points. The FANCA or FANCC cDNA was amplified by PCR, using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resulting PCR fragments were subcloned into StuI and NotI sites of MIEG3 vector to create MIEG3-FANCA or -FANCC. The NLS sequence (CCGAAGAAGAAGCGAAAGGTA) was introduced to the FANCC cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis. The FLAG-tagged NPM cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of MIEG3 vector to create MIEG3-HF-NPM. The NPMc mutation (14Falini B. Albiero E. Bolli N. De Marco M.F. Madeo D. Martelli M. Nicoletti I. Rodeghiero F. Leukemia. 2007; 21: 2052-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) was introduced to the plasmid by PCR mutagenesis. The FLAG-tagged IBRDC2 cDNA was subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of MIEG3 vector to create MIEG3-HF-IBRDC2. Retroviruses were prepared by the Vector Core of Cincinnati Children's Research Foundation (Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH). Retroviral supernatant was collected at 36, 48, and 72 h, respectively, after transfection. For retroviral transduction, cells were seeded in fibronectin (8 µg/cm2)-coated, virus supernatant-preloaded nontissue culture plates and incubated in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 4 h, and an equal volume of medium was then added to the culture. Transduction was repeated two times, and clones stably expressing WT or mutant NPM were selected in medium containing 1 µg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). pTRIPZ lentiviral vector targeting human FANCA, FANCC, KPC1, KPC2 were purchased from OpenBiosystems (Huntsville, AL). Hairpin sequence targeting luciferase (CTTACGCTGAGTACTTCGA), SCFFWB7(ACCTTCTCTGGAGAGAGAAATGC), Nedd4-1 (TTGAGATGATTTCCTAGGTCA), or IBRDC2 (CGGGTTTATATCGAACGCAAT) was also cloned into pTRIPZ empty vector. Cells were transduced with the pTRIPZ shRNA vectors and induced with Dox (Clontech) after puromycin selection and then incubated for 72 h prior to experimentation. For p65 knockdown, cells were transduced with the pGFP-V-RS vector expressing shRNA targeting p65 (purchased from OriGene, Rockville, MD). GFP-positive cells were then sorted and then subjected to experimentation. First NPM amplification: NPM1-ex12F (5′-GCCAAATCTGGCCAACTCTA-3′), NPM1-ex12R (5′-TTTACAAGACTATTTGCCATTCC-3′). Second NPM amplification: NPM1-ex12F (5′-TTAACTCTCTGGGGTAGAATGAA-3′), NPM-ex12R (5′-CAAGACTATTTGCCATTCCTAAC-3′). Sequencing: NPM1–112R (5′-CCTGGACAACATTTATCAAACAGGTA-3′).

Nuclear and cytosolic fractions of the cell extracts were prepared using a nuclear extraction kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 50 µg of cell extracts were resolved on (10%) SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were probed with antibodies for FLAG (M2; Sigma-Aldrich), NPM (Sigma-Aldrich), NPMc (Novus Bioloficals, Littleton, CO), ubiquitin (Enzo Life Sciences International, Plymouth Meeting, PA), IBRDC2 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), p65 (Abcam), or β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF, 20 µm leupeptin, 5 mm sodium vanadate). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared and incubated with the antibodies specific for the FLAG tag (M2) for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were examined directly by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies specific for indicated antibodies. Cells were cytospun onto slides and fixed in ice-cold methanol for 5 min in −20 °C. After air drying, cells were blocked for 1 h with 5% normal serum. Then cells were incubated with anti-FLAG antibody (M2) in PBS with 2% normal serum at room temperature for 1 h. After extensive washes, cells were incubated with secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch, Bar Harbor, ME). DNA was then labeled with DAPI (4,6 diamidino-2-phenylindole; Sigma-Aldrich). Slides were finally mounted in mounting medium (Vector, Burlingame, CA). Immunofluorescence-labeled cells were viewed and photographed using a Leica DM IRB microscope, and images were captured and processed using a digital camera and the OpenLab 3.1 software (Improvision, Waltham, MA). Cell lysates from indicated cells were extracted in the presence of 25 µm MG132 for 4 h followed by immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG (M2) antibody. The immunocomplexes were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibody specific for ubiquitin (Enzo Life Sciences International, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from OCI/AML3 cells using a Transfactor Extraction kit (BD Biosciences). Nuclear extracts were incubated with DNA specific for the NF-κB consensus sequence, and the DNA binding activity of NF-κB was measured using a Transfactor kit. Total RNA was prepared with RNeasy kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's procedure. Following treatment with RNase-free DNase, RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed on a ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) with SYBR Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the primers listed below. Samples were normalized to the level of GAPDH mRNA, and the relative expression levels were determined by the standard curve method. Cells were cultured in the presence of Dox (40 ng/ml) for 2 days and then treated with vehicle or etoposide (40 µm) for 12 h and harvested for immunostaining using antibody specific for allophycocyanin-conjugated Annexin V and 7-amino-actinomycin (7-AAD) (BD Biosciences) followed by flow cytometry analysis. Annexin V-positive/7-AAD-negative populations were determined as apoptotic cells using FACS Canto (BD Biosciences). Because FA can be considered as a preleukemia and patients with FA develop exclusively AML (15Lensch M.W. Rathbun R.K. Olson S.B. Jones G.R. Bagby Jr., G.C. Leukemia. 1999; 13: 1784-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we performed genomic sequencing analysis to screen the leukemic NPMc mutations in FA patients. Totally, 46 primary FA BM samples, 10 cell lines derived from FA patients, and 37 adult non-FA AML samples were examined. The NPMc-positive OCI/AML3 leukemic cell line was used as a positive control (16Quentmeier H. Martelli M.P. Dirks W.G. Bolli N. Liso A. Macleod R.A. Nicoletti I. Mannucci R. Pucciarini A. Bigerna B. Martelli M.F. Mecucci C. Drexler H.G. Falini B. Leukemia. 2005; 19: 1760-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Although some non-FA AML samples showed a TCTG duplication (type A NPMc mutation) as described previously (Fig. 1A) (10Falini B. Mecucci C. Tiacci E. Alcalay M. Rosati R. Pasqualucci L. La Starza R. Diverio D. Colombo E. Santucci A. Bigerna B. Pacini R. Pucciarini A. Liso A. Vigetti M. Fazi P. Meani N. Pettirossi V. Saglio G. Mandelli F. Lo-Coco F. Pelicci P.G. Martelli M.F. N. Engl. J.

Martelli M.F. Falini B. Blood. 2006; 108: 4146-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), no NPMc mutations were found in FA patients (Fig. 1B). To study NPMc function in FA AML cells, we attempted to express FLAG-tagged NPMc in BM cells from FA-A and FA-C AML patients. We found that NPMc was extremely unstable in FA AML cells in the absence of proteasome inhibitor MG132 (t½ <30 min) compared with FA-proficient HL60 AML cells (t½ >90 min) (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the wild-type (WT) NPM protein was relatively stable in both FA-A- and FA-C-deficient cells (Fig. 2B). We also confirmed the cytoplasmic localization of ectopically expressed NPMc by immunofluorescence using anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 2C). Thus, the cytoplasmic NPMc may undergo rapid proteasome-mediated degradation in FA AML cells. To demonstrate further that FA deficiency was responsible for rapid degradation of NPMc, we used an inducible shRNA lentivirus to knock down FANCA or FANCC in NPMc-positive OCI/AML3 leukemic cells (16Quentmeier H. Martelli M.P. Dirks W.G. Bolli N. Liso A. Macleod R.A. Nicoletti I. Mannucci R. Pucciarini A. Bigerna B. Martelli M.F. Mecucci C. Drexler H.G. Falini B. Leukemia. 2005; 19: 1760-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2D, Dox at 20 or 40 ng/ml induced efficient knockdown of FANCA and FANCC in OCI/AML3 leukemic cells. Consistent with this, the level of cytoplasmic NPMc was greatly decreased in FANCA- or FANCC-knockdown cells compared with cells expressing the luciferase control shRNA (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that the FA proteins may be required for NPMc stability. Moreover, we found that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 effectively stabilized NPMc in the FANCA or FANCC knock-down OCI/AML3 cells (Fig. 2E), which further indicates that NPMc degradation is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The rapid degradation of NPMc in FA AML cells prompted us to investigate the mechanism of NPMc maintenance. The majority of FANCC is localized in cytoplasm (1Bagby Jr., G.C. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2003; 10: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 17Hoatlin M.E. Christianson T.A. Keeble W.W. Hammond A.T. Zhi Y. Heinrich M.C. Tower P.A. Bagby Jr., G.C. Blood. 1998; 91: 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We reasoned that depletion of cytoplasmic FANCC by forcing its dislocalization to the nucleus would render NPMc susceptible to degradation. To test this, we created a FANCC mutant with a nuclear localization signal (FANCC-NLS) (Fig. 3A) and confirmed the expression (Fig. 3B) and the nuclear localization of FANCC-NLS in FANCC-deficient (FA-C) HSC536 cells by both immunostaining (Fig. 3C) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 3D). FANCC-NLS retained its nuclear function, as it could rescue FANCD2 monoubiquitination in HSC 536 cells treated with hydrogen peroxide or hydroxyurea (Fig. 3E) (1Bagby Jr., G.C. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2003; 10: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 2Kennedy R.D. D'Andrea A.D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2925-2940Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 4Green A.M. Kupfer G.M. Hematol. Oncol. Clin. North Am. 2009; 23: 193-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, FANCC-NLS failed to stabilize NPMc (Fig. 3F), as the level of NPMc was significantly reduced in cells expressing the FANCC-NLS mutant protein after 30 min of CX treatment. Thus, these results indicate that NPMc stability requires cytoplasmic FANCC. The observation that ectopically expressed NPMc was stable in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 in FA AML cells indicates that NPMc underwent ubiquitin-mediated degradation (18Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). Indeed, we observed significantly increased ubiquitinated NPMc in mutant FA-A and FA-C cells compared with normal cells in the presence of proteosome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 4A). Complementation of the mutant cells with a functional FANCA or FANCC by retroviral gene transfer prevented NPMc ubiquitination, as the amount of ubiquitinated NPMc in genetically corrected FA-A or FA-C cells was reduced to the basal level shown in normal cells (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that the FA proteins stabilize NPMc through a mechanism involving ubiquitination. Ubiquitination is a prerequisite to proteosomal targeting (18Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). To determine whether FA deficiency affects the ubiquitination process, we used shRNAs to knock down several E3 ligases including SCFFWB7, IBRDC2, KPC1, KPC2, and Nedd4-1 (19Kitagawa K. Kotake Y. Kitagawa M. Cancer Sci. 2009; 100: 1374-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 20Welcker M. Orian A. Jin J. Grim J.E. Grim J.A. Harper J.W. Eisenman R.N. Clurman B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Sudol M. Carey D.J. Yang W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 30: 1541-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and examined NPMc ubiquitination and stability in FA-A cells. As shown in Fig. 4C, knockdown of IBRDC2, an IBR-type RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligase (21Benard G. Neutzner A. Peng G. Wang C. Livak F. Youle R.J. Karbowski M. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1458-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), significantly reduced NPMc ubiquitination and restored NPMc stability in FA-A cells (Fig. 4C). Conversely, overexpression of IBRDC2 in NPMc-positive OCI/AML3 cells induced NPMc degradation (Fig. 4D). To demonstrate further the involvement of IBRDC2, we determined NPMc ubiquitination in IBRDC2-overexpressing OCI/AML3 cells in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. As shown in Fig. 4E, overexpression of IBRDC2 resulted in a significant increase in NPMc ubiquitination compared with the vector control. These data indicate that IBRDC2 is the E3 ligase ubiquitinating the cytoplasmic NPMc and provide a potential mechanistic explanation of the increased accumulation of ubiquitinated NPMc in FA-deficient cells. To investigate further how the FA proteins maintain NPMc stability, we determined whether NPMc interacted with cytoplasmic FANCA or FANCC. We expressed FLAG-tagged NPMc in normal lymphoblasts and performed immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG antibody. We observed that NPMc interacted with FANCA and FANCC in the cytoplasmic extracts but not in the nuclear fractions (Fig. 5A). To demonstrate that NPMc stability required a cytoplasmic FANCA-FANCC complex, we first examined FANCA-FANCC complex formation in fractionated cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of FANCC-deficient HSC 536 cells expressing WT-FANCC, patient-derived FANCC-L554P mutant, or FANCC-NLS. The FANCC-L554P mutant protein is defective in FA complex formation (25Gavish H. dos Santos C.C. Buchwald M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 123-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the FANCC-NLS mutant is localized only in the nucleus (Fig. 3C). Cells expressing WT-FANCC formed FANCA-FANCC complex in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions; whereas the complex was only detectable in nuclear fraction in cells expressing FANCC-NLS (Fig. 5B). As expected, FANCC-L554P failed to interact with FANCA in either cytoplasm or the nucleus (Fig. 5B). We next determined the kinetics of NPMc degradation in HSC 536 cells expressing WT-FANCC, FANCC-L554P, or FANCC-NLS. Significantly, the formation of cytoplasmic FANCA-FANCC complex was required for NPMc stability, as FANCC-L554P and FANCC-NLS failed to prevent NPMc from rapid degradation (Fig. 5C). Together, these results suggest that FANCA and FANCC stabilize NPMc through a mechanism involving the formation of a cytoplasmic complex and interaction with NPMc. To determine whether other FA mutations affect NPMc stability, we examined the effect of FANCD2 or FANCE deficiency on the formation of cytoplasmic FANCA-FANCC-NPMc complex and consequently stability of the cytoplasmic NPMc. It has been shown that FANCD2 is absolutely required for activation of the FA pathway (26Taniguchi T. Garcia-Higuera I. Andreassen P.R. Gregory R.C. Grompe M. D'Andrea A.D. Blood. 2002; 100: 2414-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and that FANCE interacts directly with FANCC in the nucleus (27Gordon S.M. Alon N. Buchwald M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36118-36125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that neither FANCD2 nor FANCE mutation disrupted the cytoplasmic FANCA-FANCC-NPMc complex (Fig. 5D) and affected NPMc stability (Fig. 5E). These data demonstrate that the stabilization of the cytoplasmic NPMc specifically requires FANCA and FANCC. We recently showed that NPM activated NF-κB and inflammatory signaling in Fancc−/− leukemic cells (28Zhou Y. Du W. Koretsky T. Bagby G.C. Pang Q. Blood. 2008; 112: 2474-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Simultaneously, Cilloni et al. reported that NPMc interacted with NF-κB in the cytoplasm and prevented the nuclear translocation and thus the activation of the transcription factor, which might contribute to increased chemosensitivity observed in NPMc-positive AML patients (29Cilloni D. Messa F. Rosso V. Arruga F. Defilippi I. Carturan S. Catalano R. Pautasso M. Panuzzo C. Nicoli P. Messa E. Morotti A. Iacobucci I. Martinelli G. Bracco E. Saglio G. Leukemia. 2008; 22: 1234-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional relevance of NPMc stabilization by cytoplasmic FANCA and FANCC, we depleted FANCA or FANCC in NPMc-positive OCI/AML3 leukemic cells by inducible shRNA lentivirus and determined NF-κB activation, inflammatory cytokine expression, and chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptosis. Correlated with increased NPMc degradation (Fig. 2C), we observed significantly increased the activity of NF-κB (Fig. 6A), the expression of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β (Fig. 6B), and resistance to ectoposide-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6C) in OCI/AML3 leukemic cells transduced with either FANCA or FANCC shRNA lentivirus. Furthermore, knockdown of the NF-κB subunit p65 (Fig. 6D) reduced expression of the inflammatory cytokines (Fig. 6E) and increased etoposide-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6F) in the FANCA- and FANCC-knockdown cells. These data provide further evidence that the increased inflammation and apoptotic resistance in the FANCA- or FANCC-knockdown NPMc-positive leukemic cells are due to increased NF-κB activity. Taken together, we conclude that the FANCA and FANCC deficiencies contribute to inflammation and chemotherapeutic resistance in NPMc-positive leukemic cells. The present study identifies a potential role of FANCA and FANCC in maintaining the stability of the leukemic NPMc, likely through the formation of a cytoplasmic FANCA-FANCC complex and interaction with NPMc protein. Whether the interaction between cytoplasmic FANCA-FANCC and NPMc blocks proteasome-associated ubiquitination and degradation of NPMc remains to be seen; however, it is clear that NPMc stability requires the formation of a cytoplasmic FANCA-FANCC subcomplex. Certain components of the FA core complex also form distinct subcomplexes among themselves or with factors outside the core complex (3de Winter J.P. Joenje H. Mutat. Res. 2009; 668: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 8Rego M.A. Kolling 4th, F.W. Howlett N.G. Mutat.

Joenie H. de Winter J.P. Blood. 2006; 108: 2072-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For example, it has been reported that the members of the eight-component FA core complex form two discrete subcomplexes, one composed of FANCA, FANCB, FANCG, FANCL, and FANCM, and the other consisting of FANCC, FANCE, and FANCF (9Medhurst A.L. el Laghmani H. Steltenpool J. Ferrer M. Fontaine C. de Groot J. Rooimans M.A. Scheper R.J. Meetei A.R. Wang W. Joenie H. de Winter J.P. Blood. 2006; 108: 2072-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Outside the FA core complex, FANCA, FANCC, and FANCG are found to associate with a variety of cellular factors that primarily function in redox-related processes (30Du W. Adam Z. Rani R. Zhang X. Pang Q. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 1909-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In the context of DNA damage repair, the FANCA protein has been shown to interact with BRCA1 (31Folias A. Matkovic M. Bruun D. Reid S. Hejna J. Grompe M. D'Andrea A. Moses R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2591-2597Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and the FANCG protein has been shown to interact with XRCC3 (32Hussain S. Witt E. Huber P.A. Medhurst A.L. Ashworth A. Mathew C.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2503-2510Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Although the exact function of these subcomplexes is not clear, their formation is consistent with the presumption that the core complex proteins may also perform other functions in addition to regulation of FANCD2 monoubiquitination. In this context, the cytoplasmic FANCA-FANCC complex represents a novel FA protein subcomplex that may function to influence leukemogenesis. The NPMc mutations are created by two characteristic changes at the C terminus of the NPM gene (33Falini B. Bolli N. Shan J. Martelli M.P. Liso A. Pucciarini A. Bigerna B. Pasqualucci L. Mannucci R. Rosati R. Gorello P. Diverio D. Roti G. Tiacci E. Cazzaniga G. Biondi A. Schnittger S. Haferlach T. Hiddemann W. Martelli M.F. Gu W. Mecucci C. Nicoletti I. Blood. 2006; 107: 4514-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar): one is the generation of an additional leucine-rich NES motif, and the other is the loss of Trp288 and Trp290 or Trp290, which are required for NPM nucleolar localization. These alterations result in aberrant cytoplasmic NPM localization, which can easily be detected by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2C). The NPMc mutations have been identified in ∼35% of adult patients and 6.5% of children with AML (10Falini B. Mecucci C. Tiacci E. Alcalay M. Rosati R. Pasqualucci L. La Starza R. Diverio D. Colombo E. Santucci A. Bigerna B. Pacini R. Pucciarini A. Liso A. Vigetti M. Fazi P. Meani N. Pettirossi V. Saglio G. Mandelli F. Lo-Coco F. Pelicci P.G. Martelli M.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 254-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar, 11Meani N. Alcalay M. Expert Rev. Anticancer. Ther. 2009; 9: 1283-1294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the NPMc mutations are AML-specific and because leukemia developed in FA patients is uniformly AML, we screened FA patients for the NPMc mutations. We found no NPMc mutations in FA patients. Interestingly, we found that deficiency in FANCA or FANCC gene led to rapid degradation of NPMc in FA AML patients and NPMc-positive AML cells (Fig. 2). Biochemically, we use a patient-derived FANCC mutant and a nuclearized FANCC to demonstrate that the interaction between FANCA-FANCC and NPMc in the cytoplasm is essential for NPMc stability. However, the functional consequence of FANCA or FANCC deficiency in NPMc-associated leukemogenesis remains to be defined. The extremely unstable NPMc in FA-deficient cells can be mitigated by the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132, suggesting that NPMc degradation is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. We showed that the cytoplasmic NPMc was ubiquitinated in mutant FA-A or FA-C lymphoblasts (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, we observed that genetic correction of the mutant FA-A or FA-C cells with a functional FANCA or FANCC gene, respectively, prevented NPMc ubiquitination (Fig. 4B). These results are consistent with the notion that the FA proteins somehow regulate the ubiquitination process. However, it remains to be established as to whether the FA proteins function in modification of NPMc (through their interaction with NPMc) (Fig. 5A) or regulation of the activity of the responsible ubiquitin ligase (Fig. 4, C–E). The ubiquitin-proteasome system controls the abundance of many cellular proteins (28Zhou Y. Du W. Koretsky T. Bagby G.C. Pang Q. Blood. 2008; 112: 2474-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The E3 ligase responsible for NPMc ubiquitination was not known. In the present study, we made an effort to identify the E3 ligase responsible for ubiquitinating NPMc. We found that knockdown of IBRDC2, an IBR-type RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligase (21Benard G. Neutzner A. Peng G. Wang C. Livak F. Youle R.J. Karbowski M. EMBO J. 2010; 29: 1458-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), significantly reduced NPMc ubiquitination and restored NPMc stability in FA-deficient cells (Fig. 4C), although overexpression of IBRDC2 in NPMc-positive OCI/AML3 cells induced NPMc ubiquitination and degradation (Fig. 4, D and E). These data not only indicate that IBRDC2 is the E3 ligase ubiquitinating the cytoplasmic NPMc, but also provide a possible mechanistic explanation of the increased accumulation of ubiquitinated NPMc in FA-deficient cells. To demonstrate that the stabilization of the cytoplasmic NPMc specifically requires FANCA and FANCC, we have examined the formation of cytoplasmic FANCA-FANCC complex and stability of the cytoplasmic NPMc in cells derived from patients carrying FANCD2 or FANCE mutation. FANCD2 is absolutely required for activation of the FA pathway (28Zhou Y. Du W. Koretsky T. Bagby G.C. Pang Q. Blood. 2008; 112: 2474-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whereas FANCE interacts directly with FANCC in the nucleus (29Cilloni D. Messa F. Rosso V. Arruga F. Defilippi I. Carturan S. Catalano R. Pautasso M. Panuzzo C. Nicoli P. Messa E. Morotti A. Iacobucci I. Martinelli G. Bracco E. Saglio G. Leukemia. 2008; 22: 1234-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Unlike FANCA or FANCC mutation, we observed an undisrupted cytoplasmic FANCA-FANCC complex (Fig. 5D) as well as stable NPMc (Fig. 5E) in the FANCD2 or FANCE mutant cells. This finding further substantiates the notion that stabilization of the cytoplasmic NPMc specifically requires FANCA and FANCC. We also show that depletion of FANCA or FANCC in NPMc-positive leukemic cells significantly increased inflammation and chemoresistance through a mechanism involving the transcription factor NF-κB (Fig. 6). NF-κB regulates the expression of anti-apoptotic genes and activates many pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which constitutes a key molecular link between inflammation and tumorigenesis as well as chemoresistance (34Naugler W.E. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2008; 18: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). In the context of leukemogenesis, NF-κB activation is known to confer resistance to chemotherapy in AML patients (35Grandage V.L. Gale R.E. Linch D.C. Khwaja A. Leukemia. 2005; 19: 586-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that NPM activated NF-κB and inflammatory signaling in Fancc−/− leukemic cells (28Zhou Y. Du W. Koretsky T. Bagby G.C. Pang Q. Blood. 2008; 112: 2474-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Simultaneously, another group reported that NPMc interacted with NF-κB in the cytoplasm and thus reduced active nuclear NF-κB, which might contribute to increased chemosensitivity of NPMc-positive leukemic cells (29Cilloni D. Messa F. Rosso V. Arruga F. Defilippi I. Carturan S. Catalano R. Pautasso M. Panuzzo C. Nicoli P. Messa E. Morotti A. Iacobucci I. Martinelli G. Bracco E. Saglio G. Leukemia. 2008; 22: 1234-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that depletion of FANCA or FANCC in NPMc-positive OCI/AML3 leukemic cells resulted in NF-κB activation, leading to increased inflammatory cytokine expression and resistance to chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6, B and C). Conversely, knockdown of p65 reduced expression of the inflammatory cytokines and increased etoposide-induced apoptosis in the FANCA and FANCC knockdown cells (Fig. 6, E and F). Therefore, the suppression of NF-κB-mediated cell signaling may offer an exciting opportunity for therapeutic intervention in FA AML patients. In the meantime, this also raises the issue of whether these results are physiologically relevant in AML. We argue that from a clinical point of view, NPMc-positive AML has a better response to chemotherapy and a functional FANCA-FANCC may contribute to this favorable prognosis through regulation of NPMc/NF-κB/inflammation. In the context of AML biology, stabilization of NPMc by cytoplasmic FANCA-FANCC would lead to the retardation of NF-κB in the cytoplasm and thus ensure the sensitivity of the AML cells to chemotherapy. During the course of leukemic evolution, a second-hit event may inactivate FANCA or FANCC in NPMc-positive AML cells. This would result in NF-κB activation leading to increased inflammation and resistance to chemotherapeutic agent-induced apoptosis, consequences presented in the present study. In conclusion, our findings not only reveal the potential molecular mechanism involving cytoplasmic retention of the leukemic NPMc but also suggest a cytoplasmic function of FANCA and FANCC in inflammation and NPMc-related leukemogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2144966952,"Identification of genetic loci in complex traits has focused largely on one-dimensional genome scans to search for associations between single markers and the phenotype. There is mounting evidence that locus interactions, or epistasis, are a crucial component of the genetic architecture of biologically relevant traits. However, epistasis is often viewed as a nuisance factor that reduces power for locus detection. Counter to expectations, recent work shows that fitting full models, instead of testing marker main effect and interaction components separately, in exhaustive multi-locus genome scans can have higher power to detect loci when epistasis is present than single-locus scans, and improvement that comes despite a much larger multiple testing alpha-adjustment in such searches. We demonstrate, both theoretically and via simulation, that the expected power to detect loci when fitting full models is often larger when these loci act epistatically than when they act additively. Additionally, we show that the power for single locus detection may be improved in cases of epistasis compared to the additive model. Our exploration of a two step model selection procedure shows that identifying the true model is difficult. However, this difficulty is certainly not exacerbated by the presence of epistasis, on the contrary, in some cases the presence of epistasis can aid in model selection. The impact of allele frequencies on both power and model selection is dramatic."
https://openalex.org/W1996842671,"Genetic circuits can implement elaborated tasks of amplitude or frequency signal detection. What type of constraints could circuits experience in the performance of these tasks, and how are they affected by molecular noise? Here, we consider a simple detection process-a signal acting on a two-component module-to analyze these issues. We show that the presence of a feedback interaction in the detection module imposes a trade-off on amplitude and frequency detection, whose intensity depends on feedback strength. A direct interaction between the signal and the output species, in a type of feed-forward loop architecture, greatly modifies these trade-offs. Indeed, we observe that coherent feed-forward loops can act simultaneously as good frequency and amplitude noise-tolerant detectors. Alternatively, incoherent feed-forward loop structures can work as high-pass filters improving high frequency detection, and reaching noise tolerance by means of noise filtering. Analysis of experimental data from several specific coherent and incoherent feed-forward loops shows that these properties can be realized in a natural context. Overall, our results emphasize the limits imposed by circuit structure on its characteristic stimulus response, the functional plasticity of coherent feed-forward loops, and the seemingly paradoxical advantage of improving signal detection with noisy circuit components."

https://openalex.org/W2015168046,"Transmitter molecules bind to synaptic acetylcholine receptor channels (AChRs) to promote a global channel-opening conformational change. Although the detailed mechanism that links ligand binding and channel gating is uncertain, the energy changes caused by mutations appear to be more symmetrical between subunits in the transmembrane domain compared with the extracellular domain. The only covalent connection between these domains is the pre-M1 linker, a stretch of five amino acids that joins strand β10 with the M1 helix. In each subunit, this linker has a central Arg (Arg(3')), which only in the non-α-subunits is flanked by positively charged residues. Previous studies showed that mutations of Arg(3') in the α-subunit alter the gating equilibrium constant and reduce channel expression. We recorded single-channel currents and estimated the gating rate and equilibrium constants of adult mouse AChRs with mutations at the pre-M1 linker and the nearby residue Glu(45) in non-α-subunits. In all subunits, mutations of Arg(3') had similar effects as in the α-subunit. In the ε-subunit, mutations of the flanking residues and Glu(45) had only small effects, and there was no energy coupling between εGlu(45) and εArg(3'). The non-α-subunit Arg(3') residues had Φ-values that were similar to those for the α-subunit. The results suggest that there is a general symmetry between the AChR subunits during gating isomerization in this linker and that the central Arg is involved in expression more so than gating. The energy transfer through the AChR during gating appears to mainly involve Glu(45), but only in the α-subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1967660158,"Background Pedigree studies of complex heritable diseases often feature nominal or ordinal phenotypic measurements and missing genetic marker or phenotype data. Methodology We have developed a Bayesian method for Linkage analysis of Ordinal and Categorical traits (LOCate) that can analyze complex genealogical structure for family groups and incorporate missing data. LOCate uses a Gibbs sampling approach to assess linkage, incorporating a simulated tempering algorithm for fast mixing. While our treatment is Bayesian, we develop a LOD (log of odds) score estimator for assessing linkage from Gibbs sampling that is highly accurate for simulated data. LOCate is applicable to linkage analysis for ordinal or nominal traits, a versatility which we demonstrate by analyzing simulated data with a nominal trait, on which LOCate outperforms LOT, an existing method which is designed for ordinal traits. We additionally demonstrate our method's versatility by analyzing a candidate locus (D2S1788) for panic disorder in humans, in a dataset with a large amount of missing data, which LOT was unable to handle. Conclusion LOCate's accuracy and applicability to both ordinal and nominal traits will prove useful to researchers interested in mapping loci for categorical traits."
