https://openalex.org/W1657253956,"Abstract Rat liver microsomal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid (HMG)-coenzyme A reductase (mevalonate:NADP oxidoreductase (acylating CoA), EC 1.1.1.34) exhibits a cyclic rhythm with peak activity at midnight. HMG-CoA reductase from microsomes of rats killed at noon and midnight has similar properties. Cycloheximide completely prevents the 5- to 10-fold rise in activity which occurs from 6 p.m. to midnight, suggesting that the rise in activity is due to synthesis of new enzyme. The effect of cycloheximide is paralleled by short duration cholesterol feeding, which blocks the cyclic rise in activity. Cholesterol does not appear to act as a feedback inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Mixing experiments indicate that the livers of cholesterol-fed rats do not contain a soluble inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Cholesterol-rich lipoproteins isolated from livers of cholesterol-fed rats and added to incubations at concentrations from 0.01 to 10 mm cholesterol did not inhibit HMG-CoA reductase from control animals. After 4 hours of cholesterol feeding, liver cholesterol concentration begins to increase and acetate incorporation into cholesterol begins to decrease sharply. The decline in cholesterol synthesis measured in a liver mince closely parallels the decline in HMG-CoA reductase activity. The observed changes in HMG-CoA reductase activity thus appear to be an accurate reflection of changes in the intracellular rate of cholesterol synthesis. After 10 hours of cholesterol feeding, acetate incorporation into cholesterol and HMG-CoA reductase activity are 22% and 19% of control values, respectively. The incorporation of acetyl-CoA into HMG-CoA and of mevalonic acid into cholesterol is unchanged. Under these conditions HMG-CoA reductase appears to be the sole regulatory site between acetyl-CoA and cholesterol."

Appropriately, their red cells contain high levels of 2,3-DPG. In contrast, the sheep, goat, cow, and cat have low oxygen affinity hemoglobins which interact weakly with 2,3-DPG, and low concentrations of red cell 2,3-DPG. These hemoglobins have structural differences at the NH(2)-terminus of the beta chain, a site where 2,3-DPG is thought to bind."
https://openalex.org/W1532382821,"Abstract The supernatant fraction of brain homogenate stimulates partially purified phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, catechol methyltransferase, and acetylserotonin methyltransferase activities in vitro. The stimulating factor was purified, and the mechanism of stimulation was investigated. The results show that S-adenosylhomocysteine, a product from S-adenosylmethionine, is a potent inhibitor of these methyltransferases, and that the stimulating factor in brain is an enzyme which enhances transmethylations by hydrolyzing S-adenosylhomocysteine. The question is raised whether inhibition by S-adenosylhomocysteine or removal of inhibition by adenosylhomocysteinase might control transmethylations of biogenic amines."
https://openalex.org/W2135597817,"Diastolic hypertension was related to significant intellectual loss over a 10-year period among individuals initially examined in their 60's. Such loss was not found in their age peers in association with normal or mild elevations of blood pressure. Of the subjects initially examined at 70 to 79 years of age, none with hypertension completed the follow-up program, and those with normal and mildly elevated blood pressure showed some intellectual decline over the decade. At the initial examination, hypertension was related to lower intelligence test scores only among those subjects who subsequently did not complete the follow-up program. The results suggest that hypertension is related to intellectual changes among the aged."

https://openalex.org/W2053691137,An analysis of the concentrations of total mercury and methylmercuric salts in lake trout of precisely known ages from 1 to 12 years has been carried out. The concentrations of both total mercury and methylmercury increased with the age of the fish. The proportion of methylmercury to total mercury also increased with age.
https://openalex.org/W1496063477,"Abstract Pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase has been purified to 90% homogeneity from Clostridium acidi-urici. Multiple forms of the enzyme were detected after acrylamide gel electrophoresis by the use of an enzyme-specific staining method. The enzyme catalyzes a pyruvate-CO2 exchange reaction, oxidation of pyruvate with the reduction of various electron acceptors, and acetoin formation from pyruvate and acetaldehyde. The enzyme contains non-heme iron, sulfide, thiamine, and a chromophore that absorbs at 400 nm. The three enzymic activities determined are not dependent on the addition of thiamine pyrophosphate when tested with the purified enzyme, but they are dependent on the addition of the cofactor when an aged crude preparation is used. The enzyme requires a high concentration of sulfhydryl compound for maximum activity and is also activated by these compounds. Coenzyme A (2 µm) is required for the pyruvate-CO2 exchange reaction, but higher concentrations of CoA inhibit this reaction. Kinetic studies demonstrate that CoA decreases the apparent Km for bicarbonate about 5-fold without affecting the Km for pyruvate. The enzyme reduces ferredoxin, rubredoxin, FAD, and artificial electron acceptors, but not pyridine nucleotides. The stoichiometry of the reaction was demonstrated with ferredoxin or benzylviologen as an electron acceptor. Clostridial ferredoxin was found to transfer two electrons in the pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase reaction. The molar extinction coefficient of reduced ferredoxin was determined to be 19.6 x 103 m-1 cm-1 at 390 nm."
https://openalex.org/W1486256500,"Electron acceptors may be divided into three distinct classes on the basis of the nature of the electron transport and phosphorylation processes which accompany their reduction by illuminated chloroplasts. Class I acceptors are reduced slowly in the absence of phosphorylation. The addition of ADP and Pi usually increases the rate 2- to 3-fold and up to 1.3 molecules of ATP are formed for each pair of electrons transferred to the acceptor. Uncouplers such as methylamine increase the rate of reduction still further. Most of the electron acceptors heretofore employed in studies of noncyclic photophosphorylation (ferredoxin, ferricyanide, viologens, and flavins) belong to this class. All are ionic or otherwise polar substances with negligible lipid solubilities. Class II acceptors are reduced rapidly whether or not phosphorylation occurs and the addition of uncouplers often does not increase the rapid rate of reduction. Little or no ATP is formed. Substances such as phenolindophenols belonging to this class have dual functions, serving both as electron acceptors and as uncouplers. They are weak acids, lipid-soluble in their nonionized, protonated forms. Their uncoupling function is enhanced as the pH is lowered and the amount of lipid-soluble acid increases. Class III acceptors are also reduced rapidly whether or not phosphorylation occurs and uncouplers again cause little or no increase in the rate of reduction. However, when ADP and Pi are added in the absence of uncouplers a high rate of phosphorylation is observed. The phosphorylation associated with Class III acceptors is usually more rapid than is the phosphorylation associated with Class I acceptors, especially at suboptimal pH. Nevertheless, over a wide range of conditions, the efficiency of phosphorylation in terms of electrons transported (P:e2) is rather precisely half of the efficiency observed when Class I acceptors are reduced. All nonionic, lipid-soluble acceptors we have investigated belong to Class III. Thus the lipid-soluble p-benzoquinone is a Class III acceptor but the lipid-insoluble p-benzoquinone sulfonate is a Class I acceptor. From these observations we conclude that electrons are transported to Class I acceptors through two sites of phosphorylation whereas the transport of electrons to Class III acceptors utilizes only one of the sites. Presumably lipid-soluble acceptors have access to and accept electrons from carriers which normally transfer electrons between the two sites of phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W2072092139,"Eggshell thickness after exposure to DDT was reduced by 21.7 percent in Alaskan tundra peregrines, by 16.8 percent in taiga peregrines, by 7.5 percent in Aleutian peregrines, by 3.3 percent in rough-legged hawks, and not at all in gyrfalcons. Tundra peregrine eggs contain an average of 889 parts of DDE per million (lipid basis); taiga peregrine eggs contain 673 parts per million; Aleutian peregrine eggs contain 167 parts per million; rough-legged hawk eggs contain 22.5 parts per million; and gyrfalcon eggs contain 3.88 parts per million. These changes in eggshell thickness and the pesticide residues reflect different degrees of exposure to contamination. There is a highly significant negative correlation between shell thickness and DDE content in peregrine eggs. Tundra and taiga peregrines have fledged progressively fewer young each year since 1966."
https://openalex.org/W2013525652,"Departing from the traditional model for teaching and learning, this article deals with the problem of teaching and learning the effective application of knowledge already acquired. To this end, a model for the process of exercising judgment was outlined, and the results of an empirical study of judgmental learning were employed to show the inadequacy of the traditional outcome feedback procedures. Computer graphics techniques were used to provide new forms of information to the learner; the results are promising for the rapid learning of a task that would otherwise be difficult to learn."

https://openalex.org/W1527123047,"Abstract Bovine parathyroid gland slices were incubated in vitro in buffers containing concentrations of calcium in the range of 0.5 mm to 2.0 mm and magnesium in the range of 0.2 mm to 1.7 mm and either a 3H- or a 14C-amino acid. After incubation, radioactive parathyroid hormone was isolated from both the tissue and the incubation medium by a combination of methods including gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. The isolation, localization, and quantification of parathyroid hormone present at various stages of purification was assisted by adding to the samples, prior to processing, small amounts of biologically synthesized, highly purified radioactive parathyroid hormone as an internal standard. The use of the internal standard to correct for losses of parathyroid hormone during processing was particularly necessary due to the finding that a large fraction of radioactive parathyroid hormone in the experimental samples could be adsorbed to the chromatographic columns employed to isolate the hormone. When the concentration of calcium was lowered, there was an increase in radioactive parathyroid hormone isolated from both the tissue and the medium. In contrast, changes in magnesium concentration had no effect on the biosynthesis of parathyroid hormone. The hormonal species obtained from tissue and the one isolated from incubation medium migrated in an identical fashion during chromatography on gels and upon electrophoresis, indicating that this species was similar to that extracted from the tissue."

Sensory analysis of the highly purified compounds revealed odor differences between enantiomeric pairs."

Short-term fluctuations in insolation appear to be associated with naturally produced tropospheric aerosols. The intrusion of volcanic dust into the stratosphere results in prolonged increases in atmospheric opacity due to the extended residence times of aerosols in the stratosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2042730431,"The olfactory nerve of the garfish, Lepisosteus, is about 1 millimeter in diameter and about 20 centimeters long, depending on the size of the fish; it is easily prepared by breaking off successive scored segments of the rostrum. It consists of a relatively homogeneous population of about 10(7) nonmyelineated nerve fibers, each about 0.24 micrometer in diameter. In most other nerves each fiber is separated from all others by an enfolding Schwann cell, but in the olfactory nerve the fibers are directly in contact with one another in groups of several hundred fibers. The Schwann cell, not directly concerned with propagation of the nerve impulse, forms a thin layer at the periphery of the group and makes up a small proportion of the total cellular material. The volume of axon cytoplasm is about five times greater than that of Schwann cell cytoplasm, and the axon surface is about 30 times the Schwann cell surface. The ratio of surface to volume for axons of a typical olfactory nerve is about 5400 times that for the squid axon of the same diameter. The large proportion of axonal membrane recommends this nerve for use in chemical and physical studies of properties of axon membranes."

Their female offspring were maintained on a normal diet from birth or from weaning and were mated with normal males. The second generation offspring at birth still had significantly lower cerebral weight and total cerebral DNA (cerebral cell number).
https://openalex.org/W1601712430,"During the process of spermatogenesis in rainbow trout, there is extensive acetylation of some histone fractions. A large proportion of the acetyl groups is present in histone IV, and the sites of acetylation in this fraction have been determined. Four lysyl residues in the NH2-terminal region at positions 5, 8, 12, and 16 were found to be acetylated in a fraction of the histone IV molecules. Acetylation of each of these 4 lysyl residues can probably occur independently of the others, at least to some extent. This leads to a complex mixture of modified histone IV molecules, which is partially reflected in the starch gel pattern of this protein. There seems to be no acetylation of the other lysyl residues in the molecule."

When maximum expiratory flow is plotted against maximum expired volume, the curves of nonsmokers and smokers differ in shape. The smokers have lower flow rates at mid-vital capacity and at lower lung volumes. This probably reflects small airway obstruction in the smokers."
https://openalex.org/W1981964474,The rate of DNA synthesis has been measured during liver regeneration in rats adapted to a controlled feeding schedule. The results show two different phenomena in the regulation of DNA synthesis. The first is the appearance of a peak of DNA synthesis following the operation itself and independent of the time of the day; the second one is the presence of constant diurnal variations in the rate of DNA synthesis in response to the partial hepatectomy and following the stimulus or stimuli of the controlled feeding schedule.
https://openalex.org/W1519121289,"Abstract Pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) from oyster tissues occurs in at least two electrophoretically and kinetically distinguishable forms in mantle tissue and in adductor muscle. In mantle, pyruvate kinase activity appears as a single band having a pI value of 6.35 while adductor pyruvate kinase appears as a doublet having pI values of 5.6 and 6.5. Both forms of the enzyme have an essential requirement for Mg++ and a monovalent cation (K+ or NH4+). The activation of oyster enzymes was more efficient with K+. Neither of the enzymes is inhibited by Cu++. In the absence of fructose 1,6-diphosphate, the Km(adp) for adductor muscle pyruvate kinase is several-fold higher than the Km(adp) for the mantle enzyme. In the presence of fructose-1,6-P2, the Km(adp) for both enzymes are identical. The Km of the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate differs for the two enzymes, Km(pep) being several-fold lower for the adductor enzyme. In the absence of fructose-1,6-P2, the Km(pep) for both enzymes decreases markedly with increasing pH; the Km(pep) is strikingly decreased by FDP and becomes insensitive to pH in presence of fructose-1,6-P2. For oyster pyruvate kinases fructose-1,6-P2 stimulation is maximal at acidic pH. Both forms of the enzymes are subject to feedback inhibition by ATP, l-alanine, and phenylalanine, and these inhibitory effects are reversed by fructose-1,6-P2. Ki values of these metabolites for adductor pyruvate kinase are lower than the Ki values of mantle enzyme. ATP inhibition differs for the two enzymes, being noncompetitive for the mantle form and competitive for the adductor enzyme. l-Alanine inhibition of both enzymes is of the mixed competitive type. Phenylalanine inhibition is competitive with respect to P-enolpyruvate for the mantle enzyme, but not for the adductor pyruvate kinase. The data in this study suggest that, as in the mammalian case, the enzyme pyruvate kinase in the oyster occurs in tissue specific multimolecular forms and that the kinetic properties of each isozyme seem to gear in well with the over-all metabolism of the tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2039438302,"Electrical responses to light stimuli were recorded intracellularly from the retinula cells and the laminar cells of the wild type and the x-7 mutant of Drosophila melanogaster in order to determine the cellular origin of the on-transient of the insect electroretinogram. The response of the retinula cell of the mutant x-7 closely resembles that of the wild type even though the ontranstent is absent from the electroretinogram of x-7. Neither contains a spike-like component that can be identified with the on-transient of the electroretinogram. However, a spike-like response resembling the on-transient in latency and time course has been obtained from one of the several types of cells in the lamina of the wild type. Moreover, the same response could not be obtained from the laminar cells of the mutant x-7. Thus, the on-transient does not appear to originate from the retinula cell but probably from one or more of several types of cells in the lamina."
https://openalex.org/W1557238604,"Abstract 1. The enzyme present in spinach leaves that catalyzes the transfer of a 2-carbon fragment from hydroxypyruvate to d-ribose, l-lyxose, d-xylose, and l-arabinose to form the corresponding free heptuloses was purified to near electrophoretic homogeneity and found to be identical with transketolase. The maximum velocity for the reaction of these pentoses with a saturating concentration of hydroxypyruvate was the same, whereas the Michaelis constants were different. The Michaelis constants were 45 mm for d-ribose, 55 mm for l-lyxose, 120 mm for l-arabinose, and 230 mm for d-xylose. It may thus be possible to account for the production of free heptuloses in plants which have been infiltrated with pentoses, without invoking the participation of phosphorylated pentose intermediates or of a new ligase. 2. Also serving as donors with transketolase when ribose was the acceptor were d-fructose and l-sorbose. When unlabeled d-sedoheptulose and ribose-5-3H were incubated with the enzyme, sedoheptulose-7-3H was formed, showing that sedoheptulose was also a donor. Moreover, 14C-gluco-heptulose was formed from sedoheptulose and l-arabinose-1-14C. 3. The molecular weight of transketolase was estimated as 100,000 ± 10,000 from gel filtration, electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate on polyacrylamide, and sedimentation equilibrium experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1550227489,"The possible structures which could arise on assembly of identical subunits into oligomeric structures have been made by assuming (a) that these are closed structures, (b) that whatever conformational changes occur on association are the same for each subunit, and (c) that there is no a priori reason for preferring a particular type of binding domain. When such an analysis is applied to dimers, trimers, and tetramers, it is seen that structures with heterologous binding sites are as likely as structures with isologous binding sites if thermodynamic considerations alone are relevant. Proteins with mixed isologous and heterologous binding sites are also found to be possible under some circumstances assuming possible values for subunit interaction constants. An analysis of the quantities of trimers, dimers, and monomers produced on dissociation of a tetramer shows that certain limits can be placed on the amounts of the dissociated species based on the possible protein structures. These limits therefore provide possible diagnostic tests for exploring protein design."

No alteration was perceived when the same tactile stimulus was applied to a similar contralateral site. These results and a lack of alteration at sensation threshold demonstrate the effect to be more than simple masking and support the Melzack-Wall theory.

https://openalex.org/W2012262141,Chickens sexed as females in commercial flocks show a low frequency of intersex individuals. Gross anatomical examination of the intersexes revealed malformed gonads. Histological examination proved that these gonads were not ovotestes but were composed of testicular tissues. Karyotype analysis of 15 intersex individuals showed 13 of them to be 3A-ZZW triploids (normal females are 2A-ZW) while the other 2 were mosaic for male and female karyotypes. Red blood cell volume accurately reflects the ploidy level and is suggested for use in screening for polyploids. Intersex triploids may develop parthenogenetically or from fertilization between reduced and unreduced gametes.

https://openalex.org/W1581487714,"Abstract We have studied the effect in vitro of cholestan-3β,5α, 6β-triol upon the conversion of tritium-labeled mavalonic acid to cholesterol. An in vitro system is described which is capable of net sterol synthesis in milligram quantities. Thus it is possible to characterize accumulating intermediates by modern physical techniques such as infrared, ultraviolet, nuclear magnetic resonance, and mass spectrometry. By using these techniques two sterols were isolated and characterized for the first time: (a) 4,4-dimethyl-Δ8(9)-cholesten-3β-ol and (b) 4β-methyl-Δ8(9)-cholesten-3β-ol. In addition, a third compound was detected and is tentatively identified as 4,4-dimethyl-Δ8(9)-cholesten-3-one. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that the polar substituents of cholestantriol at C-5 and C-6 are responsible for the ability of this compound to interfere with the enzymatic demethylation at C-4 of C-4 methyl precursors in cholesterol biosynthesis."

https://openalex.org/W2051730432,The constraint of steady-state operation for sieving or ultrafiltration across membranes greatly restricts possible theoretical mechanisms. Effective sieving in the steady state requires the coexistence of a removal mechanism with the rejection mechanism. These points are illustrated without elaborate mathematics by a model of membranes in a series array with intervening compartments. This model also shows that in certain regimes the structure of the first membrane alone determines the overall sieving characteristics of the array.

https://openalex.org/W1574841029,"Abstract Diastereomers of γ-fluoroglutamate tentatively assigned the d configuration at the α-carbon are substrates for d-glutamate cyclase purified from mouse liver. In order to elucidate properties of these potentially useful analogues of glutamate as well as to gain some insight into the mechanism of the enzyme, the kinetics and thermodynamics of the reaction of these analogues have been compared to those of glutamate. The Michaelis constant for the reaction with cis-3-fluoro-2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate (0.2 m) is comparable to that with 2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate (0.09 m) but that of trans-3-fluoro-2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate (1.5 m) is distinctly higher. The equilibrium favors pyrrolidone formation for 2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate (97%) and for trans-3-fluoro-2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate (60%) but not for cis-3-fluoro-2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate (30%). The lactamization of glutamate has an enthalpy change of +2.3 kcal per mole while that for the diastereomer of γ-fluoroglutamate forming the cis pyrrolidone is +3.8 kcal per mole. The fluorine substituent greatly increases the Vmax for the enzymatic hydrolysis in both diastereomers of the pyrrolidone. The relevance of these observations to the mechanism of the enzyme and the conformation of the substrates is discussed."
