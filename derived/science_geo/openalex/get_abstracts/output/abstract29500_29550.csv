https://openalex.org/W1996449685,"Allelic deletions involving chromosome 18q occur in more than 70 percent of colorectal cancers. Such deletions are thought to signal the existence of a tumor suppressor gene in the affected region, but until now a candidate suppressor gene on this chromosomal arm had not been identified. A contiguous stretch of DNA comprising 370 kilobase pairs (kb) has now been cloned from a region of chromosome 18q suspected to reside near this gene. Potential exons in the 370-kb region were defined by human-rodent sequence identities, and the expression of potential exons was assessed by an ""exon-connection"" strategy based on the polymerase chain reaction. Expressed exons were used as probes for cDNA screening to obtain clones that encoded a portion of a gene termed DCC; this cDNA was encoded by at least eight exons within the 370-kb genomic region. The predicted amino acid sequence of the cDNA specified a protein with sequence similarity to neural cell adhesion molecules and other related cell surface glycoproteins. While the DCC gene was expressed in most normal tissues, including colonic mucosa, its expression was greatly reduced or absent in most colorectal carcinomas tested. Somatic mutations within the DCC gene observed in colorectal cancers included a homozygous deletion of the 5' end of the gene, a point mutation within one of the introns, and ten examples of DNA insertions within a 0.17-kb fragment immediately downstream of one of the exons. The DCC gene may play a role in the pathogenesis of human colorectal neoplasia, perhaps through alteration of the normal cell-cell interactions controlling growth."
https://openalex.org/W2062582674,"Using purified recombinant fibronectins we show that WEHI 231 lymphoid cells spread only on fibronectin containing the alternatively spliced V region. Spreading is specifically blocked by peptides from the V25 segment (also called CS-1), which can be selectively spliced out independently of the rest of the V region. Using synthetic peptides we localize the binding site to a 10 amino acid segment that is highly conserved. Integrin alpha 4 beta 1 is a major integrin on the surfaces of these cells and binds specifically to the V25 segment with a primary specificity for the conserved 10 amino acid sequence. Antibodies to integrin alpha 4 inhibit spreading of WEHI 231 cells on V+ fibronectin. Therefore, integrin alpha 4 beta 1 is a fibronectin receptor specific for an alternatively spliced cell adhesion site and may play important roles in selective adhesion of various cell types to specific forms of fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W2027157544,"Mutations of the gene encoding p53, a 53-kilodalton cellular protein, are found frequently in human tumor cells, suggesting a crucial role for this gene in human oncogenesis. To model the stepwise mutation or loss of both p53 alleles during tumorigenesis, a human osteosarcoma cell line, Saos-2, was used that completely lacked endogenous p53. Single copies of exogenous p53 genes were then introduced by infecting cells with recombinant retroviruses containing either point-mutated or wild-type versions of the p53 cDNA sequence. Expression of wild-type p53 suppressed the neoplastic phenotype of Saos-2 cells, whereas expression of mutated p53 conferred a limited growth advantage to cells in the absence of wild-type p53. Wild-type p53 was phenotypically dominant to mutated p53 in a two-allele configuration. These results suggest that, as with the retinoblastoma gene, mutation of both alleles of the p53 gene is essential for its role in oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2071864393,Receptor binding studies show that resistance of a laboratory-selected Plodia interpunctella strain to a Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal crystal protein (ICP) is correlated with a 50-fold reduction in affinity of the membrane receptor for this protein. The strain is sensitive to a second type of ICP that apparently recognizes a different receptor. Understanding the mechanism of resistance will provide strategies to prevent or delay resistance and hence prolong the usefulness of B. thuringiensis ICPs as environmentally safe insecticides.
https://openalex.org/W2090393162,"Individual neurons in the brain send their axons over considerable distances to multiple targets, but the mechanisms governing this process are unresolved. An amenable system for studying axon outgrowth, branching, and target selection is the mammalian corticopontine projection. This major connection develops from parent corticospinal axons that have already grown past the pons, by a delayed interstitial budding of collateral branches that then grow directly into their target, the basilar pons. When cocultured with explants of developing cortex in three-dimensional collagen matrices, the basilar pons elicits the formation and directional growth of cortical axon collaterals across the intervening matrix. This effect appears to be target-specific and selectively influences neurons in the appropriate cortical layer. These in vitro findings provide evidence that the basilar pons becomes innervated by controlling at a distance the budding and directed ingrowth of cortical axon collaterals through the release of a diffusible, chemotropic molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2067847024,"Biochemically altered nuclear pores specifically lacking the N-acetylglucosamine-bearing pore proteins were constructed in a nuclear assembly extract in order to assign function to these proteins. The depleted pores do not bind nuclear signal sequences or actively import nuclear proteins, but they are functional for diffusion. These defects can be fully repaired by assembly with readded Xenopus pore glycoproteins. Strikingly, isolated rat pore glycoproteins also restore transport. Electron microscopy reveals that depleted pores have largely normal morphology. Thus, the pore glycoproteins are not required for assembly of the nuclear envelope, the major structures of the pore, or a pore diffusional channel. Instead, they are essential for active protein import and, unexpectedly, for construction of the part of the pore necessary for signal sequence recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1577542502,"Sphingosine, a metabolite of membrane sphingolipids, is generally considered to be cytotoxic for a variety of cell types. However, we have found that sphingosine at low concentrations stimulates DNA synthesis and acts synergistically with known growth factors to induce proliferation of quiescent Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. Structurally related analogs of sphingosine, such as N-stearoylsphingosine and other long chain aliphatic amines, had no mitogenic effects, suggesting that sphingosine did not induce nonspecific membrane perturbations. Sphingosine, which has been proposed to be a physiological inhibitor of protein kinase C, also markedly potentiates the mitogenic effect of the tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Sphingosine still stimulates DNA synthesis in cells made protein kinase C deficient by prolonged treatment with phorbol ester. At mitogenic concentrations, sphingosine does not bind to protein kinase C as shown by its lack of effect on phorbol dibutyrate binding. Only at higher concentrations, in the cytotoxic range, was there a displacement of phorbol dibutyrate from its cellular-binding sites. In contrast to sphingosine, H-7, a known inhibitor of protein kinase C, inhibited the mitogenic response to TPA and the TPA-induced phosphorylation of the 80 kDa cellular substrate of protein kinase C. Our results suggest that sphingosine may play an important role as a positive regulator of cell growth acting in a fundamentally different, protein kinase C-independent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1965588273,"A nonlysosomal pathway exists for the degradation of newly synthesized proteins retained within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This pathway is extremely selective: whereas some proteins are rapidly degraded, others survive for long periods in the ER. The question of whether this selectivity is due to the presence within the sensitive proteins of definable peptide sequences that are sufficient to target them for degradation has been addressed. Deletion of a carboxyl-terminal sequence, comprising the transmembrane domain and short cytoplasmic tail of the α chain of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR-α), prevented the rapid degradation of this polypeptide. Fusion of this carboxyl-terminal sequence to the extracellular domain of the Tac antigen, a protein that is normally transported to the cell surface where it survives long-term, resulted in the retention and rapid degradation of the chimeric protein in the ER. Additional mutagenesis revealed that the transmembrane domain of TCR-α alone was sufficient to cause degradation within the ER. This degradation was not a direct consequence of retention in the ER, as blocking transport of newly synthesized proteins out of the ER with brefeldin A did not lead to degradation of the normal Tac antigen. It is proposed that a 23-amino acid sequence, comprising the transmembrane domain of TCR-α, contains information that determines targeting for degradation within the ER system."
https://openalex.org/W2084484070,"The deficits in texture, motion, and depth perception incurred in monkeys at isoluminance were compared with the responses of neurons of the color-opponent and broad-band systems in the lateral geniculate nucleus. Texture perception, assumed to be carried by the color-opponent system, and motion and depth perception, ascribed to the broad-band pathway, were all found to be compromised but not abolished at isoluminance. Correspondingly, both the color-opponent and the broad-band systems were affected at isoluminance, but the activity of the neurons in neither system was abolished. These results suggest that impairment of visual capacities at isoluminance cannot be uniquely attributed to either of these systems and that isoluminant stimuli are inappropriate for the psychophysical isolation of these pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1482933775,"A meiosis-activated myelin basic protein (MBP) kinase was purified approximately 8700-fold from soluble post-germinal vesicle breakdown extracts from maturing oocytes of the sea star Pisaster ochraceus. Purification to apparent homogeneity was achieved by sequential chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, phosphocellulose, phenyl-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose, polylysine-Sepharose, and Mono-Q. The final product exhibited an apparent molecular mass of approximately 42 kDa by both native gradient and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and this precisely correlated with the chromatographic behavior of the recovered MBP kinase activity on a Superose 6/12 column. The kinase utilized the MBP as the major substrate with little or no phosphorylation of histones (H1, H2A, or H2B), casein, phosvitin, protamine, or 40 S ribosomal proteins. The purified enzyme was relatively insensitive to high concentrations of beta-glycerol phosphate, calmodulin, EGTA, NaCl, sodium fluoride, dithiothreitol, spermine, and heparin but was quite sensitive to inhibition by metal ions such as Mn2+, Zn2+, and Ca2+. The true Km values for ATP and myelin basic protein were determined to be 58 and 25 microM, respectively, using double-reciprocal plots. The purified enzyme was unable to utilize GTP in place of ATP. The enzyme was shown to rapidly undergo autophosphorylation. The autophosphorylation was sensitive to alkali treatment implying that phosphate was incorporated on serine/threonine residues. The properties of this MBP kinase are reminiscent of a protein kinase that is also activated in a cyclic fashion at M-phase during the early cell divisions of sea star and sea urchin embryos (Pelech, S. L., Tombe, R., Meijer, L., and Krebs, E. G. (1988) Dev. Biol. 130, 26-36)."
https://openalex.org/W1505643667,"Angiotensin II has been identified immunohistochemically in the ovaries of both rats and humans. Here we present evidence that angiotensin II (an extremely vasoactive agent in a wide range of tissues) may be involved in the regulation of the major steroidogenic enzyme in the ovary, cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P-450 (P-450scc), as well as of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), which has been implicated as an angiogenic factor in the bovine corpus luteum. We have used primary cultures of bovine luteal cells to examine the effect of angiotensin II and its receptor antagonist, saralasin, on expression of mRNA encoding bFGF as well as on progesterone production and the expression of mRNA encoding cholesterol side chain cleavage cytochrome P-450 (P-450scc). Neither angiotensin II nor saralasin when added alone to the culture medium had any effect on basal progesterone production. Luteinizing hormone (LH) caused a 15-fold increase in progesterone accumulation after 24 h of exposure which was reduced to 5-fold in the presence of angiotensin II. This appeared to be receptor-mediated in that although saralasin alone had no effect on LH-stimulated progesterone accumulation, it significantly reversed the inhibition by angiotensin II. This pattern was mirrored by the levels of mRNA encoding P-450scc, i.c., LH induced the highest levels of expression of this message, these levels were reduced by angiotensin II, and saralasin partially overcame this reduction. Levels of mRNA encoding bFGF were elevated by both LH and angiotensin II. Treatment with saralasin, however, resulted in complete inhibition of bFGF mRNA expression in the presence of both LH and angiotensin II. These results suggest a role for angiotensin II to mediate the action of LH as a regulator of bFGF expression and hence, potentially, angiogenesis. Local production of angiotensin II might also contribute to the refractoriness of luteal progesterone secretion to LH at the time of luteal regression."
https://openalex.org/W2009512469,"Incubation of a 90-kilodalton ferritin repressor protein (FRP), either free or complexed with an L-ferritin transcript, with hemin or Co3+-protoporphyrin IX prevented subsequent repression of ferritin synthesis in a wheat germ extract. Neither FeCl3 in combinations with H2O2, nor Fe3+ or Fe2+ chelated with EDTA, nor Zn2+-protoporphyrin IX, nor protoporphyrin IX caused significant inactivation of FRP. FRP that had been inactivated by hemin remained chemically intact, as revealed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Inclusion of chelators of iron or free radical scavengers did not alter the inactivation produced by hemin. These and other results indicate that hemin derepresses ferritin synthesis in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1964971008,"We have investigated whether histone H1 is present on active Balbiani ring genes in the salivary glands of Chironomus tentans using immunoelectron microscopy. The genes were studied in two activity states: maximally activated genes with a fully extended template and repressed genes in a 30 nm fiber conformation. Histone H1 was recorded on the gene in both conformations; the immunosignal was considerably stronger in the transcriptionally active state, probably reflecting the increased accessibility of histone H1 to the antibody in unfolded versus compacted chromatin. We conclude that during transcription the DNA template is extended and the nucleosomes are disrupted at the RNA polymerases, but histone H1, and most likely also the core histones, remains bound to the template."
https://openalex.org/W1990309400,"Feeding behavior of Aplysia is associated with an arousal state characterized by a constellation of maintained behaviors and by a potentiation or depression of responses to specific stimuli. A neuron (the cerebral-pedal regulator or CPR) that has widespread actions on various systems connected with feeding has been identified. CPR excites neurons that modulate or drive (i) body posture, (ii) biting, and (iii) cardiovascular behaviors. CPR also inhibits neurons concerned with defensive responses. Food stimuli, which elicit food arousal in the animal, produce prolonged excitation of the CPR. The results suggest that the CPR may evoke a central motive state representing the neuronal correlate of feeding motivation."
https://openalex.org/W1497888136,"The fluorescent sterol delta 5,7,9(11)-dehydroergostatetraen-3 beta-ol (dehydroergosterol) was used as an analogue of cholesterol to examine the molecular interaction of purified rat liver sterol carrier protein-2 (SCP-2) with sterol. The binding of dehydroergosterol to SCP-2 was evidenced by light scatter and by fluorescence polarization, lifetime, limiting anisotropy, and rotational relaxation time of dehydroergosterol. In addition, energy transfer efficiency from SCP-2 tryptophan to dehydroergosterol was 96%, indicating that the apparent distance, R, between the SCP-2 tryptophan (energy donor) and the dehydroergosterol (energy acceptor) was 13.7 A. Scatchard binding analysis of light scatter, lifetime, and energy transfer data all indicated a 1:1 molar stoichiometry with Kd = 1.2, 1.6, and 1.3 microM, respectively. SCP-2 enhanced the activity of microsomal acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase through transfer of [3H]cholesterol from donor palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol small unilamellar vesicles to rat liver microsomes containing the enzyme. A recently developed fluorescence assay utilizing dehydroergosterol fluorescence polarization (Nemecz, G., Fontaine, R. N., and Schroeder, F. (1988) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 948, 511-521; Nemecz, G., and Schroeder, F. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 7740-7749) was applied to examine the effect of SCP-2 on sterol exchange. In the absence of SCP-2, two spontaneously exchangeable sterol domains were observed in palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine/sterol (65:35 molar ratio) small unilamellar vesicles. SCP-2 enhanced the rate of exchange of the faster exchanging domain 2-fold. The transfer rate of the more slowly exchangeable sterol domain and the fraction of cholesterol represented by each domain were not affected. These results demonstrate the utility of dehydroergosterol to probe SCP-2 interactions with sterols and are indicative of a physiological role for SCP-2 as a soluble sterol carrier."
https://openalex.org/W1574956808,"The mouse adipsin gene encodes a serine protease with complement factor D activity that is expressed during adipocyte differentiation and is deficient in several animal models of obesity. We have investigated the regulation of adipsin expression by transfecting preadipocytes and adipocytes with plasmids containing the 5'-flanking region of the adipsin gene linked to a reporter gene. Constructions containing a -950 to +35 segment of the adipsin promoter were preferentially expressed in adipose cells. Deletion experiments identified a region from -114 to -38 which contains a large inverted repeat sequence and negatively regulated gene expression in preadipocytes and positively regulated expression in fat cells. Exonuclease III protection and gel retardation assays indicated that this region of duplex DNA had multiple binding sites for nuclear factors, several of which were preadipose specific. In addition, we also identified two distinct factors that bound symmetrically and sequence specifically to the inverted repeat sequences only when they were in single-stranded form; one of these factors was induced during adipocyte differentiation. These results suggest that the control of the adipsin promoter in differentiation may involve an interplay of multiple regulated DNA-binding proteins, including two that have preferential affinity for single-stranded DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1972235351,"We describe a new approach for modeling antigenic peptides recognized by T cells. Peptide A24 170-182 can compete with other antigenic peptides that are recognized by H-2kd-restricted cytolytic T cells, presumably by binding to the Kd molecule. By comparing substituted A24 peptides as competitors in a functional competition assay, the A24 residues Tyr-171, Thr-178, and Leu-179 were identified as possible contact residues for Kd. A highly active competitor peptide analog was synthesized in which Tyr was separated from the Thr-Leu pair by a pentaproline spacer. The choice of proline allowed the prediction of a probable conformation for the analog when bound to the Kd molecule. The simplest conformation of the A24 peptide that allows the same spacing and orientation of the motif as in the analog would be a nearly extended polypeptide chain incorporating a single 3(10) helical turn or similar structural kink."

https://openalex.org/W1493509173,"In some systems there are spare receptors for hormone action, i.e. only a fraction of the total number of surface receptors need be occupied by agonist to elicit maximum cellular responses. The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between angiotensin II (AII) surface receptor number and AII-induced inositol trisphosphate (IP3) formation in rat-cultured vascular smooth muscle cells. To accomplish this purpose, it was necessary to develop a method to modulate AII surface receptor number without activating phospholipase C. Incubation with the putative AII receptor antagonist Sar1,Leu8-AII (SL) caused reductions in AII surface receptor number by redistribution of receptors to the cell interior. However, in contrast to AII, SL did not elicit IP3 responses. By varying the conditions of incubation with SL, graded (32-60%) reductions in AII surface receptor number were achieved. In association with reductions in surface receptors there were comparable reductions in AII-stimulated IP3 formation. The correlation between receptor number and stimulated IP3 formation was highly linear (r = 0.99, p less than 0.01). To determine if incubation with AII also caused reductions in stimulated IP3 formation in proportion to the degree of receptor loss, AII surface receptor number was decreased by incubation with AII. Despite decreases in AII receptor number comparable to those achieved with SL, incubation with AII resulted in 2-fold greater loss of AII-stimulated IP3 formation than did incubation with SL. We conclude that in vascular smooth muscle cells 1) the AII receptor antagonist SL stimulates AII receptor trafficking without eliciting IP3 formation, 2) there are no spare AII receptors for phospholipase C-mediated IP3 formation, and 3) AII desensitization of IP3 formation is mediated by reductions in surface receptors as well as by post-receptor mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1534532061,"Human blood clotting factor IX, and two chimeric molecules of factor IX, in which the first epidermal growth factor-like domain or both epidermal growth factor-like domains have been replaced by that of human factor X, have been expressed in mouse C127 cells. The recombinants have been purified using a metal ion-dependent monoclonal antibody specific for residues 1-42 of human factor IX. All recombinant molecules are activated normally by human factor XIa in the presence of calcium ion. Activation of the factor IX recombinants by factor VIIa-tissue factor appears to be normal for the epidermal growth factor-1 exchange but considerably reduced for the construction containing both epidermal growth factor-like domains of factor X. The analysis of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid residues reveals that all of the purified recombinants are almost fully carboxylated. The extent of aspartic acid hydroxylation at residue 64 is 60% for all recombinants. The chimeric molecule with both epidermal growth factor-like domains from factor X has about 4% normal activity in the activated partial thromboplastin time assay. In contrast, the construct containing the first epidermal growth factor-like domain of factor X shows essentially normal clotting activity. Thus, it is unlikely that this domain is involved in a unique interaction with factor VIII."
https://openalex.org/W1588947966,"Caenorhabditis elegans adapted for survival in high concentrations of Cd(II) express a heavy metal binding protein designated C. elegans metallothionein-like protein or MT-Ce. This protein was purified to homogeneity and characterized. MT-Ce binds 6 mol of Cd(II)/mol protein. The sequence of 39 amino-terminal residues in MT-Ce was determined. A radiolabeled 41-mer oligonucleotide, designed from the partial MT-Ce sequence, was used in conjunction with sucrose gradient centrifugation to obtain size-fractionated poly(A+) RNA enriched in MT-Ce sequences. Subsequently, cloned cDNAs, corresponding to MT-Ce mRNA sequences, were isolated from a lambda ZapII cDNA library prepared from the enriched template mRNA. cDNA and protein sequence analysis revealed that MT-Ce comprises 62 amino acid residues and has a predicted Mr of 6462. Seventeen of the 18 Cys residues in the nematode cadmium-binding protein are included in Cys-X-Cys and X-Cys-Cys-X motifs that are characteristic of mammalian metallothioneins (MTs). However, the resemblance of MT-Ce to mammalian MTs is superficial. The amino acid sequence of MT-Ce is unique, and neither its putative alpha and beta domains nor its Cys residues can be readily aligned with the corresponding regions of other eukaryotic MTs. This suggests that MT-Ce is an example of convergent evolution. The MT-Ce mRNA level in nematodes that were selected and grown with Cd(II) concentrations that are lethal for wild-type worms, was 55-fold higher than the level of MT-Ce mRNA in wild-type C. elegans. Comparison of the sequences of MT-Ce cDNAs revealed the occurrence of two types of MT-Ce mRNA. Each contains an identical coding region, but the cDNAs diverge markedly in their 5'-untranslated regions. This suggests the possibilities of regulation by alternative splicing and/or the presence of multiple MT-Ce genes encoding a single protein, but controlled by different regulatory elements."
https://openalex.org/W2014832889,"In C. elegans males, laterally located V cells generate a simple pattern of anterior alae (cuticular ridges) and posterior rays (mating sensilla). We have found that this pattern is generated, at least in part, by the selective interruption of cell-cell interactions. In anterior V cells, lineages leading to the production of alae are induced by cell interactions. These cell interactions are inhibited in specific posterior V cells by the activity of the gene pal-1, which allows these cells to generate rays instead of alae. The activities of cell signals and pal-1 appear to influence V cell fates by determining the state of a developmental switch that involves two homeotic genes, lin-22 and mab-5."
https://openalex.org/W1512652073,"N,N'-Bis(benzyl)polyamine analogs were found to be substrates for highly purified polyamine oxidase. Metabolism of these analogs was apparently dependent on molecular O2 and resulted in the formation of benzaldehyde, H2O2, and a polyamine analog with free terminal amines. The debenzylation reaction was optimal between pH 9 and 10, identical to the pH optimum for polyamine oxidase activity when N1-acetylspermine was used as the substrate. On a molecular sieve column the debenzylating activity co-eluted with N1-acetylspermine oxidizing activity, at an apparent molecular mass of approximately 65 kDa. The purified enzyme also appeared to have a molecular mass of approximately 65 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Debenzylation of the bis(benzyl)polyamines was competitively inhibited by N1-acetylspermine and N1-acetylspermidine. The specific irreversible inhibitor of polyamine oxidase, N1,N4-bis(buta-2,3-dienyl)butanediamine also inhibited the debenzylation, whereas inhibitors of diamine and monoamine oxidases did not. The evolution of benzaldehyde from bis(benzyl)polyamine analogs by polyamine oxidase allowed the development of a simple rapid spectrophotometric assay for use in the measurement of polyamine oxidase activity in partially purified tissue or cell extracts. Further, metabolism of a bis(benzyl)polyamine analog by polyamine oxidase was found to be an important element in the growth inhibitory properties of the compound in a mouse model of malaria."

https://openalex.org/W1518473002,"The binding of human alpha-thrombin (IIa) to fibrin polymer (FnIIp) was studied in the presence and absence of a high affinity 20,300 Mr heparin (H) at pH 7.4, I 0.15, and 23 degrees C. In the absence of heparin, thrombin interacts with a high affinity class of binding sites on fibrin polymer with a dissociation constant of 301 +/- 36 nM in a manner which is independent of the enzyme active site. Studies of thrombin binding as a function of heparin and fibrin polymer concentrations imply that a ternary thrombin-fibrin polymer-heparin complex (IIa.FnIIp.H) is formed. Assembly of the ternary complex occurs randomly through the interactions of all three possible intermediate binary complexes; IIa.H, IIa.FnIIp, and FnIIp.H. Using an independently determined value of 280 +/- 35 nM for the FnIIp.H dissociation constant, global fits of the binding data yield a dissociation constant of 15 +/- 6 nM for the IIa.H interaction and 47 +/- 9 nM for the IIa.H intermediate binary complex interaction with FnIIp. These studies indicate that heparin enhances the binding of thrombin to fibrin polymer 6.4-fold with an overall dissociation constant for ternary complex formation of 705 nM2. The effect of heparin molecular weight on ternary complex formation has also been investigated. Heparins of molecular weights 11,200-20,300 behave similarly with respect to their influence on ternary complex formation, whereas heparins of lower molecular weight are less effective in promoting thrombin binding to fibrin polymer. This effect of heparin is also independent of whether it has high or low affinity for antithrombin III. The demonstration of the formation of a ternary IIa.FnIIp.H complex complements kinetic evidence indicating the formation of an analogous ternary complex with fibrin II monomer (Hogg, P. J., and Jackson, C. M. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 3619-3623). The possible implications of these findings for the in vivo distribution and actions of thrombin and the clinical efficacy of heparin are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1553129544,"The consequences of the combined effects of fibrin II monomer (FnIIm) and heparin (H) on the hydrolysis of peptidyl p-nitroanilide substrates by thrombin (IIa), the cleavage of prothrombin by thrombin and the thrombin-catalyzed release of fibrinopeptides from fibrinogen have been studied at pH 7.4 and I 0.15. The effects of fibrin II monomer and heparin on chromogenic substrate hydrolysis can be described by a hyperbolic mixed inhibition model in which substrate can interact with four possible enzyme species (IIa, IIa.H, IIa.FnIIm, and IIa.FnIIm.H) that arise as a result of random formation of a ternary complex among thrombin, fibrin II monomer, and heparin (Hogg, P. J. and Jackson, C. M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 241-247). The formation of the ternary IIa.FnIIm.H complex results in an increase in the Km values of 7.03 +/- 1.17-fold (1.37-9.65 microM) and 1.94 +/- 0.60-fold (38.1-73.9 microM) for H-D-Ile-Pro-Arg-pNA and Cbz-Gly-Pro-Arg-pNA hydrolysis, respectively, and a decrease in the kc values of 0.45 +/- 0.08-fold (49.5-22.3 s-1) and 0.52 +/- 0.05-fold (93.1-48.4 s-1). Fibrin II monomer and heparin in combination also decrease the efficiency (kc/Km) with which thrombin cleaves prothrombin to produce Fragment 1 and Prethrombin 1 by 2.3-fold from 607 +/- 30 to 264 +/- 13 M-1 s-1. In contrast to the effects of fibrin II monomer and heparin on thrombin hydrolysis of chromogenic substrates, its proteolysis of prothrombin and its inactivation by antithrombin III (Hogg, P. J., and Jackson, C. M. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 3619-3623), these components have no discernible influence on the ability of thrombin to cleave fibrinogen. These observations indicate that the substrate specificity of thrombin is altered when it is bound in a complex with fibrin II monomer and heparin and suggest that the catalytic efficiency of thrombin for its physiological substrates will be affected differentially by these interactions. Such ternary complex formation involving thrombin, fibrin II monomer, and heparin may provide a mechanism for selectively regulating thrombin action."
https://openalex.org/W2091171706,"Experiments are presented that confirm earlier predictions that the mode of supply of reactants to a nonlinear (bio)chemical reaction determines or controls concentrations at steady states far from equilibrium. The oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) catalyzed by the enzyme horseradish peroxidase with continuous input of oxygen was studied; NAD+ is continuously recycled to NADH through a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase system. A comparison of steady-state concentrations is made with an oscillatory oxygen input and a constant input at the same average oxygen input for both modes. By varying the frequency and amplitude of the perturbation (O2 influx), the following may be changed: the average concentration of NADH; the Gibbs free energy difference ΔG of the reactants and products at steady state; the average rate of the reaction; the phase relation between the oscillatory rate and ΔG; and the dissipation. These results confirm the possibility of an ""alternating current chemistry,"" of control and optimization of thermodynamic efficiency and dissipation by means of external variation of constraints in classes of nonlinear reactions and biological pumps, and of improvements of the yield in such reactions (heterogeneous catalysis, for example)."

Recently, Gibson and Edelstein challenged the reality of the quaternary enhancement effect, based on kinetic data (Gibson, Q. H., and Edelstein, S. J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 516-519). However, these studies failed to directly address the key issue of the relative affinities of dimers and alpha 2 beta 2(O2)3. Furthermore, the extent to which alpha/beta differences influence these results remains an open question. Using partial laser photolysis and O2/CO replacement techniques we have, for the first time, resolved the rates of O2 association and dissociation to both alpha and beta chains within R state tetramers and dimers. We find that the beta chains are faster than alpha for both O2 binding (approximately 2-fold) and release (approximately 3-fold). The kinetically determined O2 affinities derived from these data are essentially identical for dimers and alpha 2 beta 2(O2)3. That is, the data do not show significant quaternary enhancement and suggest that the equilibrium data have both overestimated the affinity of alpha 2 beta 2(O2)3 and underestimated the affinity of dimers. The significance of and possible origins for the discrepancy between equilibrium and kinetic data are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1520796352,"The interleukin 4 (IL-4) receptor was purified from the gibbon T cell line MLA 144. These cells were found to express high numbers of human IL-4-binding proteins (5000-6000 sites/cell) with an affinity constant (Kd) similar to that measured in human cell lines (Kd = 40-70 pM). Affinity cross-linking of 125I-IL-4 to human cell lines and MLA 144 cells demonstrated the labeling of three proteins of approximately 130, 75, and 65 kDa. Human IL-4-binding sites were solubilized from MLA 144 cells using Triton X-100 and then purified by carboxymethyl chromatography, which removed 50% of the protein without loss of IL-4-binding activity. Then sequential affinity purification over wheat germ agglutinin and a single IL-4 Affi-Gel 10 column resulted in a final 8000-fold purification of the IL-4 receptor. When analyzed on a silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel, the purified receptor migrated as a single molecular species of 130 +/- 5 kDa. Identification of the 130-kDa protein as the IL-4 receptor was demonstrated by cross-linking experiments and specific binding of 125I-IL-4 to nitrocellulose membranes after electrophoretic transfer of the purified receptor on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel."
https://openalex.org/W1715720366,"Pancreatic cholesterol esterase (CEase) regulates dietary cholesterol absorption and is activated in the presence of trihydroxy bile salts while remaining inactive monohydroxy bile salts. CEase from rat pancreas has been purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200/S-300 columns connected in series, and its homogeneity and Mr (55,418 +/- 288) have been determined by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation. The effects of tri-, di-, and monohydroxy bile salts on the conformation of the purified enzyme in buffer solution and in an in vitro assay system were studied by circular dichroism spectropolarimetry. The CD spectrum of the enzyme in solution shows a curve shape suggestive of an alpha-helicity, but low mean residue ellipticity (MRE) values may indicate an important beta-turn contribution. Sodium cholate, a trihydroxy bile salt, induces a decrease in the negative MRE values of the enzyme in solution at bile salt concentrations of 70-100 nM, with no further spectral changes at concentrations as high as 1 mM. Sodium cholate concentrations higher than 1 microM also induce an increase in the enzyme's negative MRE values under activity assay conditions, which reverts toward its original value once the reaction reaches equilibrium. These latter changes are interpreted as induced by substrate binding to the enzyme followed by partial substrate depletion after the reaction reaches equilibrium. Sodium deoxycholate, a dihydroxy bile salt, induces unstable transient increases and decreases in the MRE values of CEase in buffer solution and under activity assay conditions. These changes are bile salt concentration-dependent and may reflect self-association of the protein. Sodium taurolithocholate, a monohydroxy bile salt, does not affect the CD spectrum of CEase, and neither the di- or the monohydroxy bile salt activates the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1494206858,"Previous results demonstrated that the adenosine that accumulates in human fat cell suspensions is derived from extracellular sources (Kather, H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8803-8809). To get insight into the mechanisms responsible for the lack of adenosine release, extracellular adenine nucleotide catabolism was minimized by 10 mmol/liter beta-glycerophosphate and 10 mumol/liter alpha,beta-methyleneadenosine 5'-diphosphate. Intracellular adenine nucleotide catabolism resulted in a release of inosine and hypoxanthine under these conditions that was increased markedly by isoproterenol. Experiments with inhibitors of adenosine deaminase and adenosine kinase indicated that the production of inosine and hypoxanthine proceeded via AMP deamination. Consistently, IMP levels were increased transiently in the presence of isoproterenol. In addition, the cells possessed a nucleotide phosphomonoesterase that was resistant to the inhibitory actions of ATP and alpha,beta-methyleneadenosine 5'-diphosphate and showed preference for IMP over AMP. Adenosine (approximately 1 nmol/10(6) cells/h) was also produced inside the cells. However, adenosine production was unrelated to ATP turnover via adenylate cyclase, and any adenosine formed was immediately reconverted to adenine nucleotides in the absence and presence of isoproterenol. It was concluded that adenosine is not released by intact human adipocytes, because the alternative routes of intracellular AMP catabolism are compartmentalized (at least in functional terms), and adenosine kinase is not saturated with substrate in the absence and presence of isoproterenol."
https://openalex.org/W1516745255,"Kinetic and nucleotide binding studies have shown that submitochondrial particles from bovine heart possess three exchangeable binding sites for ADP or GDP. In order of decreasing affinity at neutral pH, these sites will be referred to as sites I, II, and III, and their respective dissociation constants as KI, KII, and KIII. In oxidative phosphorylation experiments in the presence of saturating amounts of inorganic phosphate, rapid ATP (or GTP) synthesis occurred only upon ADP (or GDP) binding to site III. The Eadie-Hofstee plots (v/[S] on the ordinate versus v on the abscissa) of the kinetics of ATP (or GTP) synthesis at variable ADP (or GDP) were, therefore, composed of an initial upward phase, indicating positive cooperativity with respect to substrate concentration, followed by a downward phase where rapid product formation took place. These data allowed calculation of KII from the upward phase and KIII (equivalent to apparent Km) from the downward phase. KI was estimated from Scatchard plots of binding data with radiolabeled ADP or GDP. Thus, together with our previous results, these findings have allowed characterization of the process of ATP or GTP synthesis by bovine-heart submitochondrial particles in terms of KI, KII, KIII, and kcat."
https://openalex.org/W1549446827,"Mitochondrial uncoupling protein, a polytopic integral protein of the inner membrane, is initially made in the cytoplasm as a soluble polypeptide (307 amino acids) lacking a cleavable targeting (signal) peptide. Earlier studies (Liu, X., Bell, A. W., Freeman, K. B., and Shore, G. C. (1988) J. Cell Biol. 107, 503-509) identified internal regions of the molecule that are critical for targeting and membrane insertion. Here, we demonstrate that the ability of uncoupling protein to insert into the inner membrane is abrogated when the molecule is fused behind the matrix-targeting signal of preornithine carbamyltransferase; the hybrid protein was imported across the inner membrane and deposited in the matrix where it was processed. In this context, however, the processed product remained in the matrix and was incapable of inserting into the inner membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1582855501,"The grasshopper neuropeptides adipokinetic hormone (AKH) I and II were among the first of an extensive family of structurally similar arthropod hormones and neuroregulators to be isolated and sequenced. This paper reports the cloning of cDNAs derived from the unusually small mRNAs (550 bases) which code for the precursors of AKH I and II from Schistocerca nitans. Sequence analysis of the cDNAs indicates that AKH I and II are derived from small precursor proteins (63 and 61 amino acids) which are 55% identical in amino acid sequence. Each contains a 22-amino acid hydrophobic leader sequence followed by the AKH I or II sequence and an additional 28-amino acid carboxyl-terminal peptide of unknown function. Significant homology at the nucleic acid level (64% identity) is confined to the coding region of the mRNA sequences. Preliminary DNA blot analyses suggest that a single gene codes for each, and that the genes for AKH I and II may be linked. Genomic blots from various tissues fail to suggest that the high level of expression of AKH in the corpora cardiaca is due to tissue specific gene amplification."

https://openalex.org/W1493330421,"In Hb Warsaw Val replaces the Phe normally present at the heme contact position beta 42 (CD1). This variant is unstable, and it readily undergoes methemoglobin formation. In DEAE-cellulose chromatography, the variant hemoglobin co-eluted with Hb A; a partially heme-depleted fraction of the variant, representing 5-6% of the total hemoglobin, eluted separately and in pure form. The heme replete form of Hb Warsaw exhibited decreased oxygen affinity with a normal Bohr effect and normal cooperativity and interaction with 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG). The heme-depleted Hb Warsaw had a higher oxygen affinity than that of Hb A, decreased cooperativity and 2,3-DPG interaction, and a very low alkaline Bohr effect. Gel filtration of the heme-depleted form showed it to exist entirely as alpha beta dimers. Globin chain synthesis by Hb Warsaw-containing reticulocytes followed a balanced alpha/beta ratio. In short-term synthesis experiments, a major portion of incorporated radiolabeled L-leucine was recovered from the dimeric, heme-depleted Hb Warsaw fraction, suggesting that subunit association precedes the incorporation of heme into the beta subunits in the post-synthetic assembly of this hemoglobin. Structural analysis of deoxyhemoglobin containing roughly equal proportions of normal and variant beta chains showed that the replacement leaves a cavity next to the heme that is large enough to hold a water molecule, which may account for the instability of Hb Warsaw. The heme and the pyrrol nearest to ValCD1 tilt into the cavity. The resulting increase in the tilt of the proximal histidine relative to the heme plane, coupled with a possible stretching of the Fe-N epsilon bond may account for the low oxygen affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1494936675,"Pituitary tissues were investigated for the presence of regulatory molecules that would alter the function of lymphoid cells. A novel endogenous polypeptide inhibitor of basal and mitogen-stimulated splenocyte DNA synthesis and proliferation, suppressin, was isolated from bovine pituitary glands. Suppressin is a potent inhibitor of basal and mitogen-stimulated splenocyte proliferation at picomole and nanomole concentrations with 50% inhibition occurring 2.8 x 10(-9) M. Suppressin was purified to apparent homogeneity using sequential (NH4)2SO4 precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, and preparative native gel electrophoresis. Biochemical characterizations of suppressin showed that this inhibitory molecule was a monomeric polypeptide with (i) a Mr = 63,000 and (ii) a pI of 8.1. Finally, metabolic labeling studies using a rat pituitary tumor cell line, GH3, showed that suppressin was synthesized de novo and secreted by these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1526292315,"The effects of oxidant stress and inhibition of glutathione reductase on the bradykinin-stimulated changes in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) of calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells were determined using the intracellular fluorescent probe, fura-2. Changes in [Ca2+]i upon stimulation with bradykinin were measured after incubation of cells with the chemical oxidant tert-butyl hydroperoxide (0.4 mM) for various times. After 60 min, bradykinin-stimulated Ca2+ influx was significantly decreased. With more prolonged incubations with the peroxide, bradykinin had little effect on cytosolic calcium concentration. Preincubation of cells with the glutathione reductase inhibitor, carmustine, led to elevated basal [Ca2+]i, yet the cells remained responsive to bradykinin. However, incubation of carmustine-treated cells with tert-butyl hydroperoxide for 30 min dramatically reduced both bradykinin-stimulated release of Ca2+ from internal stores and influx of Ca2+ from the extracellular space. These results suggest that inhibition of glutathione reductase alters cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis and enhances the effects of oxidative stress on signal transduction in vascular endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1494661189,"The kinetics of assembly, cell surface expression, secretion, and degradation of the major lactosaminoglycan (LAG)-bearing glycoproteins in mouse uterine epithelial cells have been studied. LAGs have been shown previously to be synthesized preferentially by these cells in the uterus and are expressed at the cell surface, where they participate in cell adhesion processes (Dutt, A., Tang., J.-P., and Carson, D. D. (1987) Dev. Biol. 119, 27-37). We utilized selection on pokeweed mitogen-Sepharose, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and subsequent electroelution to isolate the major LAG-bearing glycoproteins. The intact LAG-bearing glycoproteins exhibited very high apparent Mr (greater than 500,000) both by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and molecular exclusion chromatography under dissociative conditions. The subset of LAGs at the cell surface exhibited a half-life of approximately 11 h, whereas total cell-associated LAGs had a half-life of 6 +/- 1 h. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that the transit time of LAG core proteins from the rough endoplasmic reticulum to the site of LAG addition in the Golgi was 30-45 min. LAG glycoprotein transit from the Golgi to the cell surface required at least an additional 30-45 min. The major metabolic fate of the cell-associated LAGs was secretion to the medium with no evidence of lysosomal degradation. Some (30%) of the LAGs appeared to be released to the medium via the action of cell surface proteases. Epithelial cell surfaces bound fluoresceinated pokeweed mitogen, indicating the constitutive presence of LAG-bearing molecules at the cell surface; pokeweed mitogen binding to the cell surface was completely blocked by 10 mM chitotriose. These observations provide the first comprehensive description of the intracellular transport and metabolism of this interesting class of glycoproteins of the uterine epithelial cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1641336266,"A novel reaction, catalyzed by Manduca sexta lipid transfer particle (LTP), transforms low density lipophorin (LDLp) into two distinct lipoprotein species. A population of LDLp particles serves as lipid donor or acceptor in LTP-catalyzed production of a very low density lipophorin (VLDLp) and a high density lipophorin (HDLp) product. The products result from facilitated net transfer of lipid mass from donor LDLp particles to acceptor LDLp particles. Transfer of apolipophorin III (apoLp-III) from donor to acceptor lipoprotein occurs during the reaction to produce a lipid- and apoLp-III-enriched VLDLp species and lipid- and apoLp-III-depleted HDLp species. The VLDLp produced in this in vitro reaction contains more lipid and apoLp-III than any previous lipophorin species reported and further demonstrates the scope of the lipid binding capacity of lipophorin. Lipid analysis and radiolabeling studies confirmed that unidirectional net transfer of lipid mass and apoLp-III from donor to acceptor occurs. When 3H-lipid-LDLp was used as substrate in the LTP-catalyzed disproportionation reaction the density distribution of radioactivity and protein provided evidence of vectorial transfer of diacylglycerol, phospholipid, and free fatty acids. Electron micrographs of the original LDLp population and of the LTP-induced product lipoprotein population provided further support for the interpretation derived from biochemical studies. This LTP-catalyzed disproportionation was observed only with apoLp-III-rich LDLp suggesting that the presence of increased amounts of this apoprotein dramatically affects the properties of the particle and appears to be directly related to the capacity of the lipoprotein to bind lipid."

https://openalex.org/W1497892914,"Brush border vesicles prepared from horse renal cortex were used to study the kinetic properties of the Na+-L-lactate carrier on the outer and inner faces of the membrane. Two methods were applied for these measurements (in the absence of an electrical gradient): a direct method using influx and efflux kinetics, and an indirect method applied to trans-stimulated influx kinetics using membrane vesicles preloaded with various pyruvate concentrations (the latter enabled us to observe simultaneously the inner and outer carrier properties). Kinetic parameters obtained by the first method have shown that under sodium lactate chemical gradient, the carrier efficiency (estimated by the ratio of k = Vm/Km) is higher for the influx than efflux, a mechanism indicating a kinetic asymmetry of the transport. This difference remains at chemical equilibrium of solute concentration. The similarity of outer and inner affinity of sodium permits one to conclude that the kinetic asymmetry of the sodium lactate transport is related to the lactate-carrier interaction and not to that of the sodium-carrier. The second method using the pyruvate trans-activation effect (under sodium chemical equilibrium) has shown an affinity of lactate (Kt(out) = 1.1 mM), about 15 times higher for the carrier in the extracellular orientation than that of pyruvate for the carrier in the intracellular orientation (Kt(pyr) = 36 mM). This method has demonstrated a ping pong mechanism for the trans-activation exchange which accounts for a selective pore carrier model like a gated channel. These asymmetric properties are related to the AS glide sequential model (A and S being Na+ and lactate, respectively) proposed previously for the Na-L-lactate cotransport and to a different accessibility of the organic solute but not of the sodium on the two membrane faces."
https://openalex.org/W1564624778,"The carboxyl-terminal fibrin-binding domain, Fib2, of human fibronectin was expressed in mouse L cells as a fusion protein with the signal sequence of human protein C inhibitor. The recombinant Fib2 (rFib2) protein synthesized by transfected cells retained the ability to form dimers with each other or with mouse fibronectin subunits and was secreted to the medium after extensive glycosylation. Only a small fraction of the secreted protein was incorporated into the pericellular matrix. Interestingly, the secreted rFib2 protein displayed a remarkable heterogeneity upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, giving rise to a broad band corresponding to Mr of 60,000-90,000. The heterogeneity was eliminated mostly by treatment with neuraminidase and further by treatment with endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. Treatment with peptide:N-glycosidase F did not alter the heterogeneity of the protein, indicating that differential sialylation of O-linked, but not N-linked, glycans is largely responsible for the apparent heterogeneity. The presence of O-linked but absence of N-linked glycans was further supported by the observations that peanut agglutinin specifically bound to the desialylated rFib2 protein, whereas neither concanavalin A nor lentil lectin bound to the protein irrespective of prior neuraminidase treatment. Since the apparent heterogeneity of the rFib2 protein was only observable with the secreted, but not the cytoplasmic form, sialylation of O-linked glycans may be essential for, or regulate as a rate-limiting step, the transit of the recombinant protein to the extracellular space."

There are eight molecules per unit cell, with one molecule (Mr = 4771) in each asymmetric unit. Precession photographs show that crystals diffract beyond 2.7-A resolution and are stable in the x-ray beam at room temperature for at least 200 h; thus, they can be used to collect three-dimensional data for a detailed crystallographic analysis."
