https://openalex.org/W2041440766,"We performed an integrated genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic characterization of 373 endometrial carcinomas using array- and sequencing-based technologies. Uterine serous tumours and ∼25% of high-grade endometrioid tumours had extensive copy number alterations, few DNA methylation changes, low oestrogen receptor/progesterone receptor levels, and frequent TP53 mutations. Most endometrioid tumours had few copy number alterations or TP53 mutations, but frequent mutations in PTEN, CTNNB1, PIK3CA, ARID1A and KRAS and novel mutations in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex gene ARID5B. A subset of endometrioid tumours that we identified had a markedly increased transversion mutation frequency and newly identified hotspot mutations in POLE. Our results classified endometrial cancers into four categories: POLE ultramutated, microsatellite instability hypermutated, copy-number low, and copy-number high. Uterine serous carcinomas share genomic features with ovarian serous and basal-like breast carcinomas. We demonstrated that the genomic features of endometrial carcinomas permit a reclassification that may affect post-surgical adjuvant treatment for women with aggressive tumours. An integrative genomic analysis of several hundred endometrial carcinomas shows that a minority of tumour samples carry copy number alterations or TP53 mutations and many contain key cancer-related gene mutations, such as those involved in canonical pathways and chromatin remodelling; a reclassification of endometrial tumours into four distinct types is proposed, which may have an effect on patient treatment regimes. This paper from The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network presents an in-depth genome-wide analysis of endometrial (uterine) carcinomas from more than 350 patients. Based on a series of genomic features including newly identified hotspot mutations in the DNA polymerase gene POLE, and novel mutations in the ARID5B DNA-binding protein, the authors propose a reclassification of endometrial tumours into four distinct types. This might have clinical relevance for post-surgical adjuvant treatment of women with aggressive tumours."

https://openalex.org/W2035477608,"This Perspective discusses the emerging advances in plant membrane transporters, which can be used to improve crop yields, nutritional value, and environmental stress resistance. Transport proteins embedded in the cell membranes are key targets for improving the efficiency with which plants take up and use water and nutrients. In this Perspective article, Julian Schroeder et al. discuss recent work on the development of specialized plant membrane transporters that can enhance crop yields, increase nutritional value and boost resistance to stresses including pathogens. Promising lines of development include aluminium-tolerant cereals that thrive in acid soil, salt-tolerant varieties that grow in soils affected by salinity or sodium toxicity, and plants containing high levels of the iron and zinc micronutrients often scarce in predominantly plant-based diets in developing countries. With the global population predicted to grow by at least 25 per cent by 2050, the need for sustainable production of nutritious foods is critical for human and environmental health. Recent advances show that specialized plant membrane transporters can be used to enhance yields of staple crops, increase nutrient content and increase resistance to key stresses, including salinity, pathogens and aluminium toxicity, which in turn could expand available arable land."
https://openalex.org/W2019778278,"Background To know how moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time change across lifespan periods is needed for designing successful lifestyle interventions. We aimed to study changes in objectively measured (accelerometry) MVPA and sedentary time from childhood to adolescence and from adolescence to young adulthood. Methods Estonian and Swedish participants from the European Youth Heart Study aged 9 and 15 years at baseline (N = 2312) were asked to participate in a second examination 6 (Sweden) to 9/10 (Estonia) years later. 1800 participants with valid accelerometer data were analyzed. Results MVPA decreased from childhood to adolescence (−1 to −2.5 min/d per year of follow-up, P = 0.01 and <0.001, for girls and boys respectively) and also from adolescence to young adulthood (−0.8 to −2.2 min/d per year, P = 0.02 and <0.001 for girls and boys, respectively). Sedentary time increased from childhood to adolescence (+15 and +20 min/d per year, for girls and boys respectively, P<0.001), with no substantial change from adolescence to young adulthood. Changes in both MVPA and sedentary time were greater in Swedish than in Estonian participants and in boys than in girls. The magnitude of the change observed in sedentary time was 3–6 time larger than the change observed in MVPA. Conclusions The decline in MVPA (overall change = 30 min/d) and increase sedentary time (overall change = 2∶45 h/d) observed from childhood to adolescence are of concern and might increase the risk of developing obesity and other chronic diseases later in life. These findings substantially contribute to understand how key health-related behaviors (physical activity and sedentary) change across important periods of life."
https://openalex.org/W2037338346,"Background and Aims The clinical onset and severity of intestinal disorders in humans and animals can be profoundly impacted by early life stress. Here we investigated the impact of early weaning stress in pigs on intestinal physiology, clinical disease, and immune response to subsequent challenge with enterotoxigenic F18 E. coli (ETEC). Methodology Pigs weaned from their dam at 16 d, 18 d, and 20 d of age were given a direct oral challenge of F18 ETEC at 26 d of age. Pigs were monitored from days 0 to 4 post-infection for clinical signs of disease. On Day 4 post-ETEC challenge, ileal barrier function, histopathologic and inflammatory cytokine analysis were performed on ileal mucosa. Results Early weaned pigs (16 d and 18 d weaning age) exhibited a more rapid onset and severity of diarrhea and reductions in weight gain in response to ETEC challenge compared with late weaned pigs (20 d weaning age). ETEC challenge induced intestinal barrier injury in early weaned pigs, indicated by reductions in ileal transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and elevated FD4 flux rates, in early weaned pig ileum but not in late weaned pigs. ETEC-induced marked elevations in IL-6 and IL-8, neutrophil recruitment, and mast cell activation in late-weaned pigs; these responses were attenuated in early weaned pigs. TNF levels elevated in ETEC challenged ileal mucosa from early weaned pigs but not in other weaning age groups. Conclusions These data demonstrate the early weaning stress can profoundly alter subsequent immune and physiology responses and clinical outcomes to subsequent infectious pathogen challenge. Given the link between early life stress and gastrointestinal diseases of animals and humans, a more fundamental understanding of the mechanisms by which early life stress impacts subsequent pathophysiologic intestinal responses has implications for the prevention and management of important GI disorders in humans and animals."
https://openalex.org/W1985877093,"Can behavior be unconsciously primed via the activation of attitudes, stereotypes, or other concepts? A number of studies have suggested that such priming effects can occur, and a prominent illustration is the claim that individuals' accuracy in answering general knowledge questions can be influenced by activating intelligence-related concepts such as professor or soccer hooligan. In 9 experiments with 475 participants we employed the procedures used in these studies, as well as a number of variants of those procedures, in an attempt to obtain this intelligence priming effect. None of the experiments obtained the effect, although financial incentives did boost performance. A Bayesian analysis reveals considerable evidential support for the null hypothesis. The results conform to the pattern typically obtained in word priming experiments in which priming is very narrow in its generalization and unconscious (subliminal) influences, if they occur at all, are extremely short-lived. We encourage others to explore the circumstances in which this phenomenon might be obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2163635701,"The detection of electron spins associated with single defects in solids is a critical operation for a range of quantum information and measurement applications under development1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. So far, it has been accomplished for only two defect centres in crystalline solids: phosphorus dopants in silicon, for which electrical read-out based on a single-electron transistor is used1, and nitrogen–vacancy centres in diamond, for which optical read-out is used4,5,6. A spin read-out fidelity of about 90 per cent has been demonstrated with both electrical read-out1 and optical read-out10,11; however, the thermal limitations of the former and the poor photon collection efficiency of the latter make it difficult to achieve the higher fidelities required for quantum information applications. Here we demonstrate a hybrid approach in which optical excitation is used to change the charge state (conditional on its spin state) of an erbium defect centre in a silicon-based single-electron transistor, and this change is then detected electrically. The high spectral resolution of the optical frequency-addressing step overcomes the thermal broadening limitation of the previous electrical read-out scheme, and the charge-sensing step avoids the difficulties of efficient photon collection. This approach could lead to new architectures for quantum information processing devices and could drastically increase the range of defect centres that can be exploited. Furthermore, the efficient electrical detection of the optical excitation of single sites in silicon represents a significant step towards developing interconnects between optical-based quantum computing and silicon technologies."
https://openalex.org/W2160619276,"Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are frequently co-morbid, and dysfunctional frontal-striatal circuits have been implicated in both disorders. Neurobiological distinctions between OCD and MDD are insufficiently clear, and comparative neuroimaging studies are extremely scarce. OCD and MDD may be characterized by cognitive rigidity at the phenotype level, and frontal-striatal brain circuits constitute the neural substrate of intact cognitive flexibility. In the present study, 18 non-medicated MDD-free patients with OCD, 19 non-medicated OCD-free patients with MDD, and 29 matched healthy controls underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging during performance of a self-paced letter/digit task switching paradigm. Results showed that both patient groups responded slower relative to controls during repeat events, but only in OCD patients slowing was associated with decreased error rates. During switching, patients with OCD showed increased activation of the putamen, anterior cingulate and insula, whereas MDD patients recruited inferior parietal cortex and precuneus to a lesser extent. Patients with OCD and MDD commonly failed to reveal anterior prefrontal cortex activation during switching. This study shows subtle behavioral abnormalities on a measure of cognitive flexibility in MDD and OCD, associated with differential frontal-striatal brain dysfunction in both disorders. These findings may add to the development of biological markers that more precisely characterize frequently co-morbid neuropsychiatric disorders such as OCD and MDD."
https://openalex.org/W2028128868,"Findings from nitrogen (N) manipulation studies have provided strong evidence of the detrimental impacts of elevated N deposition on the structure and functioning of heathland ecosystems. Few studies, however, have sought to establish whether experimentally observed responses are also apparent under natural, field conditions. This paper presents the findings of a nationwide field-scale evaluation of British heathlands, across broad geographical, climatic and pollution gradients. Fifty two heathlands were selected across an N deposition gradient of 5.9 to 32.4 kg ha−1 yr−1. The diversity and abundance of higher and lower plants and a suite of biogeochemical measures were evaluated in relation to climate and N deposition indices. Plant species richness declined with increasing temperature and N deposition, and the abundance of nitrophilous species increased with increasing N. Relationships were broadly similar between upland and lowland sites, with the biggest reductions in species number associated with increasing N inputs at the low end of the deposition range. Both oxidised and reduced forms of N were associated with species declines, although reduced N appears to be a stronger driver of species loss at the functional group level. Plant and soil biochemical indices were related to temperature, rainfall and N deposition. Litter C:N ratios and enzyme (phenol-oxidase and phosphomonoesterase) activities had the strongest relationships with site N inputs and appear to represent reliable field indicators of N deposition. This study provides strong, field-scale evidence of links between N deposition - in both oxidised and reduced forms - and widespread changes in the composition, diversity and functioning of British heathlands. The similarity of relationships between upland and lowland environments, across broad spatial and climatic gradients, highlights the ubiquity of relationships with N, and suggests that N deposition is contributing to biodiversity loss and changes in ecosystem functioning across European heathlands."
https://openalex.org/W1968572762,"Recent clinical data support the clinical use of oral lavender oil in patients suffering from subsyndromal anxiety. We identified the molecular mechanism of action that will alter the perception of lavender oil as a nonspecific ingredient of aromatherapy to a potent anxiolytic inhibiting voltage dependent calcium channels (VOCCs) as highly selective drug target. In contrast to previous publications where exorbitant high concentrations were used, the effects of lavender oil in behavioral, biochemical, and electrophysiological experiments were investigated in physiological concentrations in the nanomolar range, which correlate to a single dosage of 80 mg/d in humans that was used in clinical trials. We show for the first time that lavender oil bears some similarities with the established anxiolytic pregabalin. Lavender oil inhibits VOCCs in synaptosomes, primary hippocampal neurons and stably overexpressing cell lines in the same range such as pregabalin. Interestingly, Silexan does not primarily bind to P/Q type calcium channels such as pregabalin and does not interact with the binding site of pregabalin, the α2δ subunit of VOCCs. Lavender oil reduces non-selectively the calcium influx through several different types of VOCCs such as the N-type, P/Q-type and T-type VOCCs. In the hippocampus, one brain region important for anxiety disorders, we show that inhibition by lavender oil is mainly mediated via N-type and P/Q-type VOCCs. Taken together, we provide a pharmacological and molecular rationale for the clinical use of the oral application of lavender oil in patients suffering from anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W1605837172,"The development of disease-modifying therapy for Parkinson disease has been a main drug development challenge, including the need to deliver the therapeutic agents to the brain. Here, we examined the ability of mannitol to interfere with the aggregation process of α-synuclein in vitro and in vivo in addition to its blood-brain barrier-disrupting properties. Using in vitro studies, we demonstrated the effect of mannitol on α-synuclein aggregation. Although low concentration of mannitol inhibited the formation of fibrils, high concentration significantly decreased the formation of tetramers and high molecular weight oligomers and shifted the secondary structure of α-synuclein from α-helical to a different structure, suggesting alternative potential pathways for aggregation. When administered to a Parkinson Drosophila model, mannitol dramatically corrected its behavioral defects and reduced the amount of α-synuclein aggregates in the brains of treated flies. In the mThy1-human α-synuclein transgenic mouse model, a decrease in α-synuclein accumulation was detected in several brain regions following treatment, suggesting that mannitol promotes α-synuclein clearance in the cell bodies. It appears that mannitol has a general neuroprotective effect in the transgenic treated mice, which includes the dopaminergic system. We therefore suggest mannitol as a basis for a dual mechanism therapeutic agent for the treatment of Parkinson disease."
https://openalex.org/W1978195758,"Background The traditional Mediterranean dietary pattern (MedDiet) is associated with longevity and low rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, there is little information on who is more likely to follow this food pattern. Aim To evaluate how different factors are associated with lower MedDiet adherence in older Spanish subjects. Methods We included 7305 participants (men aged 55–80 y, women 60–80 y) at high-risk of CVD recruited into the PREDIMED trial (ISRCTN35739639). Socioeconomic, anthropometric, lifestyle characteristics and CVD risk factors were recorded. A validated 14-item questionnaire was used to evaluate MedDiet adherence at baseline. Multivariate models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals for lower adherence to the MedDiet (<9 points out of 14) and ascertain factors independently associated with it. Results Former smoking (OR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.78–0.98), physical activity (OR for the 3rd vs. the 1sttertile: 0.69; 0.62–0.78), and higher educational level (OR for university vs. less than primary school: 0.54; 0.38–0.77) were associated with higher MedDiet adherence. Conversely, having a larger waist-to-height ratio (OR for 0.1 units, 1.35; 1.22–1.49), being diabetic (OR = 1.13; 1.03–1.24), being single (OR = 1.27; 1.01–1.61) or divorced or separated (OR = 1.44; 1.09–1.89), and current smoking (OR = 1.28; 1.11–1.47) were associated with lower adherence. Conclusions Participants with little education, a larger waist-to-height ratio, or diabetes and those who were less physically active, single, divorced or separated, or smokers were less likely to adhere to the MedDiet, an ideal model for food choices. Stronger efforts of health promotion are needed in these groups to foster adoption of the MedDiet."
https://openalex.org/W2040515264,"Phage therapy may become a complement to antibiotics in the treatment of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. To design efficient therapeutic cocktails, the genetic diversity of the species and the spectrum of susceptibility to bacteriophages must be investigated. Bacterial strains showing high levels of phage resistance need to be identified in order to decipher the underlying mechanisms. Here we have selected genetically diverse P. aeruginosa strains from cystic fibrosis patients and tested their susceptibility to a large collection of phages. Based on plaque morphology and restriction profiles, six different phages were purified from ""pyophage"", a commercial cocktail directed against five different bacterial species, including P. aeruginosa. Characterization of these phages by electron microscopy and sequencing of genome fragments showed that they belong to 4 different genera. Among 47 P. aeruginosa strains, 13 were not lysed by any of the isolated phages individually or by pyophage. We isolated two new phages that could lyse some of these strains, and their genomes were sequenced. The presence/absence of a CRISPR-Cas system (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and Crisper associated genes) was investigated to evaluate the role of the system in phage resistance. Altogether, the results show that some P. aeruginosa strains cannot support the growth of any of the tested phages belonging to 5 different genera, and suggest that the CRISPR-Cas system is not a major defence mechanism against these lytic phages."
https://openalex.org/W2033467450,"Transit of human neural stem cells, ReNcell CX, through the blood brain barrier (BBB) was evaluated in an in vitro model of BBB and in nude mice. The BBB model was based on rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (RBMECs) cultured on Millicell inserts bathed from the basolateral side with conditioned media (CM) from astrocytes or glioma C6 cells. Glioma C6 CM induced a significant transendothelial migration of ReNcells CX in comparison to astrocyte CM. The presence in glioma C6 CM of high amounts of HGF, VEGF, zonulin and PGE2, together with the low abundance of EGF, promoted ReNcells CX transmigration. In contrast cytokines IFN-α, TNF-α, IL-12p70, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10, as well as metalloproteinases -2 and -9 were present in equal amounts in glioma C6 and astrocyte CMs. ReNcells expressed the tight junction proteins occludin and claudins 1, 3 and 4, and the cell adhesion molecule CRTAM, while RBMECs expressed occludin, claudins 1 and 5 and CRTAM. Competing CRTAM mediated adhesion with soluble CRTAM, inhibited ReNcells CX transmigration, and at the sites of transmigration, the expression of occludin and claudin-5 diminished in RBMECs. In nude mice we found that ReNcells CX injected into systemic circulation passed the BBB and reached intracranial gliomas, which overexpressed HGF, VEGF and zonulin/prehaptoglobin 2."
https://openalex.org/W1977337763,"The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of diet-induced obesity on hearing degeneration in CD/1 mice. Sixty 4-week-old male CD/1 mice were randomly and equally divided into 2 groups. For 16 weeks, the diet-induced obesity (DIO) group was fed a high fat diet and the control group was fed a standard diet of 13.43 % kcal fat. The morphometry, biochemistry, auditory brainstem response thresholds, omental fat, and histopathology of the cochlea were compared between the beginning and end of the study (4 vs. 20 weeks old). The results show that the body weight, fasting plasma triglyceride concentrations, and omental fat weight were higher in the DIO group than in the control group at the end of experiment. The auditory brainstem response thresholds at high frequencies were significantly elevated in the DIO group compared to those of the control group. Histology studies showed that, compared to the control group, the DIO group had blood vessels with smaller diameters and thicker walls in the stria vascularis at the middle and basal turns of the cochlea. The cell densities in the spiral ganglion and spiral ligament at the basal turn of the cochlea were significantly lower in the DIO group. Immunohistochemical staining showed that hypoxia-induced factor 1 (HIF-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), caspase 3, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, and apoptosis inducing factor were all significantly more dense in the spiral ganglion and spiral ligament at the basal turn of cochlea in the DIO group. Our results suggest that diet-induced obesity exacerbates hearing degeneration via increased hypoxia, inflammatory responses, and cell loss in the spiral ganglion and spiral ligament and is associated with the activation of both caspase-dependent and -independent apoptosis signaling pathways in CD/1 mice."
https://openalex.org/W1980069714,"In this manuscript we argue for a broader use of the term ‘relative age effect’ due to the influence of varying development policies on the development of sport expertise. Two studies are presented on basis of data from Schorer, et al. [1]. The first showed clear ‘constant year effects’ in the German handball talent development system. A shift in year groupings for the female athletes resulted in a clear shift of birth year patterns. In the second study we investigated whether the constant year effect in the national talent development system carried over to professional handball. No patterns were observable. Together both studies show that a differentiation of varying effects that often happen simultaneously is necessary to understand the secondary mechanisms behind the development of sport expertise."
https://openalex.org/W2018446493,"Background Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is characterized by a cluster of psychological and somatic symptoms during the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle that disappear after the onset of menses. Behavioral differences in emotional and cognitive processing have been reported in women with PMS, and it is of particular interest whether PMS affects the parallel execution of emotional and cognitive processing. Related to this is the question of how the performance of women with PMS relates to stress levels compared to women without PMS. Cortisol has been shown to affect emotional processing in general and it has also been shown that women with severe PMS have a particular cortisol profile. Methods We measured performance in an emotional conflict task and stress levels in women with PMS (n = 15) and women without PMS (n = 15) throughout their menstrual cycle. Results We found a significant increase (p = 0.001) in the mean reaction time for resolving emotional conflict from the follicular to the luteal cycle phase in all subjects. Only women with PMS demonstrated an increase in physiological and subjective stress measures during the luteal menstrual cycle phase. Conclusions Our findings suggest that the menstrual cycle modulates the integration of emotional and cognitive processing in all women. Preliminary data are supportive of the secondary hypothesis that stress levels are mediated by the menstrual cycle phase only in women with PMS. The presented evidence for menstrual cycle-specific differences in integrating emotional and cognitive information highlights the importance of controlling for menstrual cycle phase in studies that aim to elucidate the interplay of emotion and cognition."
https://openalex.org/W1999742637,"Background Pregnant women were suspected to be at particular risk when H1N1pnd09 influenza became pandemic in 2009. Our primary objective was to compare the immune responses conferred by MF59®-adjuvanted vaccine (Focetria®) in H1N1pnd09-naïve pregnant and non-pregnant women. The secondary aims were to compare influences of dose and adjuvant on the immune response. Methods The study was nested in the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood (COPSAC2010) pregnancy cohort in 2009-2010 and conducted as a single-blinded block-randomised [1∶1∶1] controlled clinical trial in pregnant women after gestational week 20: (1) 7.5 µg H1N1pnd09 antigen with MF59-adjuvant (Pa7.5 µg); (2) 3.75 µg antigen half MF59-adjuvanted (Pa3.75 µg); (3) 15 µg antigen unadjuvanted (P15 µg); and in non-pregnant women receiving (4) 7.5 µg antigen full adjuvanted (NPa7.5 µg). Blood samples were collected at baseline, 3 weeks, 3 and 10 months after vaccination, adverse events were recorded prospectively. Results 58 pregnant women were allocated to Pa7.5 µg and 149 non-pregnant women were recruited to NPa7.5 µg. The sero-conversion rate was significantly increased in non-pregnant (NPa7.5 µg) compared with pregnant (Pa7.5 µg) women (OR = 2.48 [1.03–5.95], p = 0.04) and geometric mean titers trended towards being higher, but this difference was not statistically significant (ratio 1.27 [0.85–1.93], p = 0.23). The significant titer increase rate showed no difference between pregnant (Pa7.5 µg) and non-pregnant (NPa7.5 µg) groups (OR = 0.49 [0.13–1.85], p = 0.29). Conclusion Our study suggests the immune response to the 7.5 µg MF59-adjuvanted Focetria® H1N1pnd09 vaccine in pregnant women may be diminished compared with non-pregnant women.

Published studies that analyzed variability in the expression of DMET genes were limited by sample sizes and the number of genes profiled. We systematically analyzed the expression of 374 DMETs from a microarray data set consisting of gene expression profiles derived from 427 human liver samples. The standard deviation of interindividual expression for DMET genes was much higher than that for non-DMET genes. The 20 DMET genes with the largest variability in the expression provided examples of the interindividual variation. Gene expression data were also analyzed using network analysis methods, which delineates the similarities of biological functionalities and regulation mechanisms for these highly variable DMET genes. Expression variability of human hepatic DMET genes may affect drug-gene interactions and disease susceptibility, with concomitant clinical implications."
https://openalex.org/W2040792883,"Background A striking characteristic of the past four influenza pandemic outbreaks in the United States has been the multiple waves of infections. However, the mechanisms responsible for the multiple waves of influenza or other acute infectious diseases are uncertain. Understanding these mechanisms could provide knowledge for health authorities to develop and implement prevention and control strategies. Materials and Methods We exhibit five distinct mechanisms, each of which can generate two waves of infections for an acute infectious disease. The first two mechanisms capture changes in virus transmissibility and behavioral changes. The third mechanism involves population heterogeneity (e.g., demography, geography), where each wave spreads through one sub-population. The fourth mechanism is virus mutation which causes delayed susceptibility of individuals. The fifth mechanism is waning immunity. Each mechanism is incorporated into separate mathematical models, and outbreaks are then simulated. We use the models to examine the effects of the initial number of infected individuals (e.g., border control at the beginning of the outbreak) and the timing of and amount of available vaccinations. Results Four models, individually or in any combination, reproduce the two waves of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in the United States, both qualitatively and quantitatively. One model reproduces the two waves only qualitatively. All models indicate that significantly reducing or delaying the initial numbers of infected individuals would have little impact on the attack rate. Instead, this reduction or delay results in a single wave as opposed to two waves. Furthermore, four of these models also indicate that a vaccination program started earlier than October 2009 (when the H1N1 vaccine was initially distributed) could have eliminated the second wave of infection, while more vaccine available starting in October would not have eliminated the second wave."
https://openalex.org/W2043962428,"Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are common and important plant symbionts. They have coenocytic hyphae and form multinucleated spores. The nuclear genome of AMF is polymorphic and its organization is not well understood, which makes the development of reliable molecular markers challenging. In stark contrast, their mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) is homogeneous. To assess the intra- and inter-specific mitochondrial variability in closely related Glomus species, we performed 454 sequencing on total genomic DNA of Glomus sp. isolate DAOM-229456 and we compared its mtDNA with two G. irregulare isolates. We found that the mtDNA of Glomus sp. is homogeneous, identical in gene order and, with respect to the sequences of coding regions, almost identical to G. irregulare. However, certain genomic regions vary substantially, due to insertions/deletions of elements such as introns, mitochondrial plasmid-like DNA polymerase genes and mobile open reading frames. We found no evidence of mitochondrial or cytoplasmic plasmids in Glomus species, and mobile ORFs in Glomus are responsible for the formation of four gene hybrids in atp6, atp9, cox2, and nad3, which are most probably the result of horizontal gene transfer and are expressed at the mRNA level. We found evidence for substantial sequence variation in defined regions of mtDNA, even among closely related isolates with otherwise identical coding gene sequences. This variation makes it possible to design reliable intra- and inter-specific markers."

Here, we analyze baseline type-specific HPV DNA and HPV-specific antibody positivity rates.We enrolled 3569 men and women, 16-24 years of age, from 14 STI clinics, and estimated genital and anal HPV DNA and antibody positivity rates of 7 main carcinogenic HPV types. Generalized estimating equations regression analyses were applied to determine risk factors for, and associations between, type-specific HPV DNA and antibody positivity.Genital HPV DNA positivity rates were higher in women than in men; anal HPV DNA was especially high in men who have sex with men (MSM). HPV antibody seropositivity rates were also highest in women and MSM. High-risk sexual behavior was predictive of both HPV DNA and antibody positivity. Despite a strong correlation in serological profiles for multiple HPV types, seropositivity was independently associated with homologous HPV DNA detection.HPV DNA and antibody positivity rates are higher in women and MSM than in heterosexual men, but their association is similar across gender. This suggests a site-specific natural course of infection."

Keratinocytes isolated from the skin of Sgpp1−/− pups had increased intracellular S1P levels and displayed a gene expression profile that indicated overexpression of genes associated with keratinocyte differentiation. The results reveal S1P metabolism as a regulator of keratinocyte differentiation and epidermal homeostasis. Sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase 1, encoded by Sgpp1, dephosphorylates the signaling lysophospholipid, S1P; however, its in vivo functions are not well understood. Deletion of Sgpp1 causes epidermal defects with intrinsic keratinocyte abnormalities. Sgpp1 deficiency in keratinocytes causes S1P elevation and accelerates their differentiation."

Ethnic minority women are more likely to have a lower socio-economic status (SES) but it is unclear whether SES is an independent risk factor for mental health in pregnancy. We described the association between maternal mental distress and socio-demographic factors in a multi-ethnic cohort located in an economically deprived city in the UK.We defined eight distinct ethno-language groups (total N = 8,454) and classified a threshold of distress as the 75th centile of within-group GHQ-28 scores, which we used as the outcome for univariate and multivariate logistic regression for each ethnic group and for the sample overall.Financial concerns were strongly and independently associated with worse mental health for six out of the eight ethnic groups, and for the cohort overall. In some groups, factors such as working status, education and family structure were associated with worse mental health, but for others these factors were of little importance.The diversity between and within ethnic groups in this sample underlines the need to take into consideration individual social, migration and economic circumstances and their potential effect on mental health in ethnically diverse areas."
https://openalex.org/W2167845253,"The anti-inflammatory peptide annexin-1 binds to formyl peptide receptors (FPR) but little is known about its mechanism of action in the vasculature. Here we investigate the effect of annexin peptide Ac2-26 on NADPH oxidase activity induced by tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) in human endothelial cells. Superoxide release and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production from NADPH oxidase was measured with lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence and 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate, respectively. Expression of NADPH oxidase subunits and intracellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1) were determined by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Promoter activity of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) was measured by luciferase activity assay. TNFα stimulated NADPH-dependent superoxide release, total ROS formation and expression of ICAM-1and VCAM-1. Pre-treatment with N-terminal peptide of annexin-1 (Ac2-26, 0.5–1.5 µM) reduced all these effects, and the inhibition was blocked by the FPRL-1 antagonist WRW4. Furthermore, TNFα-induced NFκB promoter activity was attenuated by both Ac2-26 and NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyliodonium (DPI). Surprisingly, Nox4 gene expression was reduced by TNFα whilst expression of Nox2, p22phox and p67phox remained unchanged. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase activity by either dominant negative Rac1 (N17Rac1) or DPI significantly attenuated TNFα-induced ICAM-1and VCAM-1 expression. Ac2-26 failed to suppress further TNFα-induced expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in N17Rac1-transfected cells. Thus, Ac2-26 peptide inhibits TNFα-activated, Rac1-dependent NADPH oxidase derived ROS formation, attenuates NFκB pathways and ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in endothelial cells. This suggests that Ac2-26 peptide blocks NADPH oxidase activity and has anti-inflammatory properties in the vasculature which contributes to modulate in reperfusion injury inflammation and vascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W1974883167,"Liver kinase β1 (LKB1, also known as STK11) is a serine/threonine kinase that has multiple cellular functions including the regulation of cell polarity and motility. Murine proteomic studies show that LKB1 loss causes aberrant adhesion signaling; however, the mechanistic underpinnings of this relationship are unknown. We show that cells stably depleted of LKB1 or its co-activator STRADα have increased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at Tyr397/Tyr861 and enhanced adhesion to fibronectin. LKB1 associates in a complex with FAK and LKB1 accumulation at the cellular leading edge is mutually excluded from regions of activated Tyr397-FAK. LKB1-compromised cells lack directional persistence compared with wild-type cells, but this is restored through subsequent pharmacological FAK inhibition or depletion, showing that cell directionality is mediated through LKB1-FAK signaling. Live cell confocal imaging reveals that LKB1-compromised cells lack normal FAK site maturation and turnover, suggesting that defects in adhesion and directional persistence are caused by aberrant adhesion dynamics. Furthermore, re-expression of full-length wild-type or the LKB1 N-terminal domain repressed FAK activity, whereas the kinase domain or C-terminal domain alone did not, indicating that FAK suppression is potentially regulated through the LKB1 N-terminal domain. Based upon these results, we conclude that LKB1 serves as a FAK repressor to stabilize focal adhesion sites, and when LKB1 function is compromised, aberrant FAK signaling ensues, resulting in rapid FAK site maturation and poor directional persistence.Background: LKB1 is a serine/threonine kinase important for cell polarity and motility.Results: LKB1 loss causes focal adhesion kinase hyperactivation and aberrant cell motility.Conclusion: LKB1 represses focal adhesion kinase to regulate its turnover.Significance: This provides information on how LKB1 regulates the cell adhesion pathway during cell motility.

Cell motility involves a complex regulation of cytoskeletal elements and signaling molecules to generate a force to propel the cell forward.

Cell motility itself has been studied in a variety of organisms to create a general model. First, cells polarize to establish a direction of movement and then generate actin-based lamellipodia (9Etienne-Manneville S. Polarity proteins in migration and invasion.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 6970-6980Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Within the lamellipodia and surrounding region, motility proteins are targeted via microtubules and actin to regulate signaling events that control movement, directionality, and adhesion. The coordinated cycle of lamellipodia extension, formation of adhesion sites, site turnover, and translocation of the cell body are essential for directed cell movement (10Jiang P. Enomoto A. Takahashi M. Cell biology of the movement of breast cancer cells. Intracellular signalling and the actin cytoskeleton.Cancer Lett. 2009; 284: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The dynamic regulation of adhesion signaling is important for proper cell motility to occur. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) 2The abbreviations used are: FAK, focal adhesion kinase; ROI, region of interest; co-IP, co-immunoprecipitation; NTD, amino-terminal domain. acts as a signaling node at cell adhesion sites called focal contacts to promote cytoskeletal reorganization, adhesion, migration, and survival (11Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A.

A series of tyrosine phosphorylation events controls FAK activation whereby ligand binding to a FAK-associated integrin causes autophosphorylation of FAK at residue Tyr397 (12Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D.

We build upon these findings to determine how LKB1 regulates FAK and to test the central hypothesis that LKB1 inactivation promotes aberrant cell migration through uncontrolled adhesion signaling. Our results show that LKB1 represses FAK activation whereby LKB1 (or STRADα) loss leads to FAK activation and causes a more exploratory behavior during cell migration. When present, LKB1 stabilizes focal adhesions at the leading edge of migratory cells to repress focal adhesion site turnover. We conclude that LKB1 serves as a FAK repressor, and when LKB1 is absent, aberrant FAK signaling ensues, resulting in rapid FAK site turnover and lack of directional persistence. H1299 or H157 human NSCLC cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml of penicillin/streptomycin, and maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Stable pLKO.1 vector control, LKB1-shRNA, and STRAD-shRNA H1299 cells were created by lentiviral infection using specific shRNA constructs from Open Biosystems (Rockford, IL) as described (38Zhong D.

Unless otherwise noted, cells were plated onto tissue culture plates or slides coated with 5 μg/cm2 of human fibronectin (Chemicon/Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For drug treatment studies, cells were treated with either DMSO vehicle or the indicated concentration of the FAK inhibitor PF-573228 (Sigma). Antibodies against FAK-Tyr(P)397, FAK-Tyr(P)861 (Invitrogen), total FAK (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ), STRAD N-13 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), LKB1, FLAG® M2 and GFP (Sigma), and GAPDH (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) were used for Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation assays. The first LKB1 siRNA sequence used was GGACUGACGUGUAGAACAATT and the second from Sigma (catalog number SIHK2135). siRNA to FAK was from a Dharmacon Smart Pool, catalog number L-003164-00-0005. For cell adhesion studies, all cell lines were trypsinized concurrently, neutralized, and re-suspended in normal growth media at 3.0 × 105 cells/ml. Using a multichannel pipette, 100 μl of cell suspension were added to individual wells of a 96-well plate. At 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 min post-seeding, the contents of the respective wells were aspirated. The wells were then washed carefully with PBS twice and fresh growth media was added to allow for normal cell growth and attachment to occur until the last time point was reached. After 80 min, the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (Invitrogen) was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol to quantitate the number of attached cells. Individual time points were plated in triplicate for each cell line and the data from three separate assays were combined to determine relative cell adhesion. Transient siRNA transfections were performed using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) and 200 nm scrambled control, LKB1-, STRAD-, or FAK-specific siRNA oligos (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. FLAG-LKB1 truncates in the pcDNA3 vector were generated by the Emory University Custom Cloning Core Facility.

https://openalex.org/W1993734510,"Background The role and mechanism of action of MIF in hyperoxia-induced acute lung injury (HALI) in the newborn lung are not known. We hypothesized that MIF is a critical regulatory molecule in HALI in the developing lung. Methodology We studied newborn wild type (WT), MIF knockout (MIFKO), and MIF lung transgenic (MIFTG) mice in room air and hyperoxia exposure for 7 postnatal (PN) days. Lung morphometry was performed and mRNA and protein expression of vascular mediators were analyzed. Results MIF mRNA and protein expression were significantly increased in WT lungs at PN7 of hyperoxia exposure. The pattern of expression of Angiopoietin 2 protein (in MIFKO>WT>MIFTG) was similar to the mortality pattern (MIFKO>WT>MIFTG) in hyperoxia at PN7. In room air, MIFKO and MIFTG had modest but significant increases in chord length, compared to WT. This was associated with decreased expression of Angiopoietin 1 and Tie 2 proteins in the MIFKO and MIFTG, as compared to the WT control lungs in room air. However, on hyperoxia exposure, while the chord length was increased from their respective room air controls, there were no differences between the 3 genotypes. Conclusion These data point to the potential roles of Angiopoietins 1, 2 and their receptor Tie2 in the MIF-regulated response in room air and upon hyperoxia exposure in the neonatal lung."
https://openalex.org/W2076098475,"The exact underlying pathomechanism of central sleep apnea with Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSA-CSR) is still unclear. Recent studies have demonstrated an association between cerebral white matter changes and CSA. A dysfunction of central respiratory control centers in the brainstem was suggested by some authors. Novel MR-imaging analysis tools now allow far more subtle assessment of microstructural cerebral changes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether and what severity of subtle structural cerebral changes could lead to CSA-CSR, and whether there is a specific pattern of neurodegenerative changes that cause CSR. Therefore, we examined patients with Fabry disease (FD), an inherited, lysosomal storage disease. White matter lesions are early and frequent findings in FD. Thus, FD can serve as a ""model disease"" of cerebral microangiopathy to study in more detail the impact of cerebral lesions on central sleep apnea.Genetically proven FD patients (n = 23) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 44) underwent a cardio-respiratory polysomnography and brain MRI at 3.0 Tesla. We applied different MR-imaging techniques, ranging from semiquantitative measurement of white matter lesion (WML) volumes and automated calculation of brain tissue volumes to VBM of gray matter and voxel-based diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analysis.In 5 of 23 Fabry patients (22%) CSA-CSR was detected. Voxel-based DTI analysis revealed widespread structural changes in FD patients when compared to the healthy controls. When calculated as a separate group, DTI changes of CSA-CSR patients were most prominent in the brainstem. Voxel-based regression analysis revealed a significant association between CSR severity and microstructural DTI changes within the brainstem.Subtle microstructural changes in the brainstem might be a neuroanatomical correlate of CSA-CSR in patients at risk of WML. DTI is more sensitive and specific than conventional structural MRI and other advanced MR analyses tools in demonstrating these abnormalities."

Scorpion α-toxins affect insect and/or mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels (Navs) and thereby modify the excitability of muscle and nerve cells. Although more than 100 α-toxins are known and a number of them have been studied into detail, the molecular mechanism of their interaction with Navs is still poorly understood. Here, we employ extensive molecular dynamics simulations and spatial mapping of hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties distributed over the molecular surface of α-toxins. It is revealed that despite the small size and relatively rigid structure, these toxins possess modular organization from structural, functional, and evolutionary perspectives. The more conserved and rigid “core module” is supplemented with the “specificity module” (SM) that is comparatively flexible and variable and determines the taxon (mammal versus insect) specificity of α-toxin activity. We further show that SMs in mammal toxins are more flexible and hydrophilic than in insect toxins. Concomitant sequence-based analysis of the extracellular loops of Navs suggests that α-toxins recognize the channels using both modules. We propose that the core module binds to the voltage-sensing domain IV, whereas the more versatile SM interacts with the pore domain in repeat I of Navs. These findings corroborate and expand the hypothesis on different functional epitopes of toxins that has been reported previously. In effect, we propose that the modular structure in toxins evolved to match the domain architecture of Navs.Background: Scorpion α-toxins affect voltage-gated sodium channels in both mammals and insects.Results: We perform thorough computational analyses of α-toxin molecular architecture and structure-function relationship.Conclusion: Taxon specificity of “orphan” toxins can be predicted from a structural perspective.Significance: The proposed surface mapping technique is a new tool to analyze protein-protein complexes.

Significance: The proposed surface mapping technique is a new tool to analyze protein-protein complexes. Voltage-gated sodium channels (Navs) 6The abbreviations used are:Nav, voltage-gated sodium channel; MD, molecular dynamics; MHP, molecular hydrophobicity potential; PD, pore domain; RMSF, root mean square fluctuation; RMSF-NM, RMSF along the first eigenvector in the normal mode analysis; SM, specificity module; Trx, thioredoxin; VSD, voltage-sensing domain; RT, reverse turn. are vital components of the nervous system and muscles, playing a central role in the excitability of these tissues (1Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA2001: 1-93Google Scholar, 2Catterall W.A. From ionic currents to molecular mechanisms. The structure and function of voltage-gated sodium channels.Neuron. 2000; 26: 13-25Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1702) Google Scholar). Dysfunctions of Navs cause a number of channelopathies (3Andavan G.S. Lemmens-Gruber R. Voltage-gated sodium channels. Mutations, channelopathies and targets.Curr. Med. Chem. 2011; 18: 377-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and approaches for treatment of these diseases are eagerly awaited. The pore-forming α-subunit of Navs (∼260 kDa) is organized in four non-identical but homologous repeats (pseudosubunits) (I–IV), each consisting of six transmembrane segments (S1–S6). Segments S1–S4 form a voltage-sensing domain (VSD) in each of the repeats (VSDs I-IV), whereas segments S5 and S6 from all four repeats contribute to the sole pore domain (PD) of Navs (PDs I–IV will denote S5-S6 from corresponding repeats). We should note here that the homologous repeats of Navs are more often referred to as “domains” in the literature. Although imperfect, we shall follow this conventional nomenclature. Nav pharmacology is mostly determined by the α-subunit. Note that at present nine isoforms of α-subunit have been well characterized in humans (Nav1.1–1.9), and just one appears to function in insects (e.g. the Para protein in Drosophila) (4Lopreato G.F. Lu Y. Southwell A. Atkinson N.S. Hillis D.M. Wilcox T.P. Zakon H.H. Evolution and divergence of sodium channel genes in vertebrates.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Neurosci. 2007; 7: 17-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). To date, a host of substances has been described affecting Navs through binding to different parts of the channels, so-called receptor sites (6Stevens M. Peigneur S. Tytgat J. Neurotoxins and their binding areas on voltage-gated sodium channels.Front. Pharmacol. 2011; 2: 71Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). One of the most prominent examples is scorpion α-toxins, classical and potent modulators of Navs, which slow or inhibit channel inactivation, leading to prolongation of the action potential (7Bosmans F. Tytgat J. Voltage-gated sodium channel modulation by scorpion α-toxins.Toxicon. 2007; 49: 142-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Scorpion α-toxins bind to receptor site 3 of Navs, whereas the first two sites are targeted by tetrodotoxin and batrachotoxin, respectively (8Catterall W.A. Goldin A.L. Waxman S.G. International Union of Pharmacology. XLVII. Nomenclature and structure-function relationships of voltage-gated sodium channels.Pharmacol. Rev. 2005; 57: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Extensive mutagenesis of Navs (in particular the rat neuronal isoform Nav1.2) allowed mapping of receptor site 3 to the extracellular surface of VSD IV of the channels with additional participation of the loops protruding from PD I (9Rogers J.C.

Chem. 2011; 286: 35209-35217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Besides being the armament of venomous animals, natural toxins are perfect tools for investigation of the channel structure and function. They also represent templates for generation of pharmacologically active compounds modifying selectively Navs activity. Understanding of structure-activity and structure-selectivity relationships in toxins will serve as a firm basis for design of novel selective Nav modulators helpful in treating channelopathies in humans or, for example, generation of novel selective and safe insecticides. Conventionally, scorpion α-toxins are divided into three groups based on taxon selectivity of their action: “mammal toxins” preferentially affecting mammals, “insect toxins” showing high insect toxicity, and “α-like toxins” affecting both mammals and insects (12Gordon D. Karbat I. Ilan N. Cohen L. Kahn R. Gilles N. Dong K. Stühmer W. Tytgat J. Gurevitz M. The differential preference of scorpion α-toxins for insect or mammalian sodium channels. Implications for improved insect control.Toxicon. 2007; 49: 452-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This classification is not strict, however, because insect toxins, for instance, are able to kill mammals, albeit at higher doses. Scorpion α-toxins have been the objects of structural biology research for over 25 years (13Pashkov V.S. Maiorov V.N. Bystrov V.F. Hoang A.N. Volkova T.M. Grishin E.V. Solution spatial structure of “long” neurotoxin M9 from the scorpion Buthus eupeus by 1H-NMR spectroscopy.Biophys. Chem. 1988; 31: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 14Pashkov V.S. Khoang N.A. Maĭorov V.N. Bystrov V.F. [The structure of Buthus eupeus neurotoxin M9 in a solution studied by 1H-NMR spectroscopy].Bioorg. Khim. 1986; 12: 1306-1316PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been firmly established that these small proteins (∼65 residues) share a common βαββ motif, stapled by four disulfide bridges (7Bosmans F. Tytgat J. Voltage-gated sodium channel modulation by scorpion α-toxins.Toxicon. 2007; 49: 142-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Although much effort has been made to understand the structure-activity relationships in the three groups of α-toxins, no universal conclusion has been derived. It is apparent that toxin selectivity is somehow encoded in the properties of its molecular surface and dynamics. A number of techniques have been developed for delineation of specific regions on molecular surfaces, which can be potentially involved in protein-protein recognition. Detailed mapping of surface hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties of two interacting molecules has been widely used for protein-ligand and protein-protein interactions (15Pyrkov T.V. Priestle J.P.

Chem. 2012; 20: 5410-5415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), where molecular surface properties are projected onto a plane, cylinder, or sphere, aiding reduction of complexity and facilitating relatively straightforward comparison of projected “maps” rather than matching complex three-dimensional shapes. To address the problem of α-toxin selectivity, we employ an original computational approach for detailed mapping and comparison of various physico-chemical properties, namely, hydrophobicity, flexibility, and electrostatic potential. This approach is based on spherical projection of the molecular properties and initially takes into account the dynamic behavior of molecules. Our results add novel atomistic description of putative mechanism of Nav-selective recognition by their peptide ligands and bring new formalism into the field of toxinology. To enrich statistics, structures of several α-toxins with known pharmacological profile were modeled using related toxins as templates (see Table 1 for details). Alignments were produced with the ClustalW software (19Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F. Wallace I.M. Wilm A. Lopez R. Thompson J.D.

Comparative protein structure modeling using MODELLER.Curr. Protoc. Protein Sci. 2007; (Chapter 2, Unit 2.9)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cis/trans configuration of the peptide bond between residues 8 and 9 was left “as is” in experimental structures; in models, the configuration was derived from templates, but it always got stabilized as trans for mammal and insect toxins and primarily cis for α-like toxins. The C termini of certain toxins were amidated where needed (see the footnotes to Table 1). 20 models were produced for each molecule; the model with the lowest value of the energy-like Modeler objective function was selected for molecular dynamics (MD) calculations.TABLE 1Properties of α-toxins involved in the studyComputed datacThese parameters were computed from the 20–60-ns time span of MD simulations (the first 20 ns were considered as the equilibration period).

https://openalex.org/W2056181964,"Purpose PP2A is a serine/threonine phosphatase critical to physiological processes, including apoptosis. Cell penetrating peptides are molecules that can translocate into cells without causing membrane damage. Our goal was to develop cell-penetrating fusion peptides specifically designed to disrupt the caspase-9/PP2A interaction and evaluate their therapeutic potential in vitro and in vivo. Experimental Design We generated a peptide containing a penetrating sequence associated to the interaction motif between human caspase-9 and PP2A (DPT-C9h), in order to target their association. Using tumour cell lines, primary human cells and primary human breast cancer (BC) xenografts, we investigated the capacity of DPT-C9h to provoke apoptosis in vitro and inhibition of tumour growth (TGI) in vivo. DPT-C9h was intraperitonealy administered at doses from 1 to 25 mg/kg/day for 5 weeks. Relative Tumour Volume (RTV) was calculated. Results We demonstrated that DPT-C9h specifically target caspase-9/PP2A interaction in vitro and in vivo and induced caspase-9-dependent apoptosis in cancer cell lines. DPT-C9h also induced significant TGI in BC xenografts models. The mouse-specific peptide DPT-C9 also induced TGI in lung (K-Ras model) and breast cancer (PyMT) models. DPT-C9h has a specific effect on transformed B cells isolated from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients without any effect on primary healthy cells. Finally, neither toxicity nor immunogenic responses were observed. Conclusion Using the cell-penetrating peptides blocking caspase-9/PP2A interactions, we have demonstrated that DPT-C9h had a strong therapeutic effect in vitro and in vivo in mouse models of tumour progression."
https://openalex.org/W1966158281,"Nucleosome structure and stability affect genetic accessibility by altering the local chromatin morphology. Recent FRET experiments on nucleosomes have given valuable insight into the structural transformations they can adopt. Yet, even if performed under seemingly identical conditions, experiments performed in bulk and at the single molecule level have given mixed answers due to the limitations of each technique. To compare such experiments, however, they must be performed under identical conditions. Here we develop an experimental framework that overcomes the conventional limitations of each method: single molecule FRET experiments are carried out at bulk concentrations by adding unlabeled nucleosomes, while bulk FRET experiments are performed in microplates at concentrations near those used for single molecule detection. Additionally, the microplate can probe many conditions simultaneously before expending valuable instrument time for single molecule experiments. We highlight this experimental strategy by exploring the role of selective acetylation of histone H3 on nucleosome structure and stability; in bulk, H3-acetylated nucleosomes were significantly less stable than non-acetylated nucleosomes. Single molecule FRET analysis further revealed that acetylation of histone H3 promoted the formation of an additional conformational state, which is suppressed at higher nucleosome concentrations and which could be an important structural intermediate in nucleosome regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2081474622,"Natural polyphenol compounds are often good antioxidants, but they also cause damage to cells through more or less specific interactions with proteins. To distinguish antioxidant activity from cytotoxic effects we have tested four structurally related hydroxyflavones (baicalein, mosloflavone, negletein, and 5,6-dihydroxyflavone) at very low and physiologically relevant levels, using two different cell lines, L-6 myoblasts and THP-1 monocytes. Measurements using intracellular fluorescent probes and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy in combination with cytotoxicity assays showed strong antioxidant activities for baicalein and 5,6-dihydroxyflavone at picomolar concentrations, while 10 nM partially protected monocytes against the strong oxidative stress induced by 200 µM cumene hydroperoxide. Wide range dose-dependence curves were introduced to characterize and distinguish the mechanism and targets of different flavone antioxidants, and identify cytotoxic effects which only became detectable at micromolar concentrations. Analysis of these dose-dependence curves made it possible to exclude a protein-mediated antioxidant response, as well as a mechanism based on the simple stoichiometric scavenging of radicals. The results demonstrate that these flavones do not act on the same radicals as the flavonol quercetin. Considering the normal concentrations of all the endogenous antioxidants in cells, the addition of picomolar or nanomolar levels of these flavones should not be expected to produce any detectable increase in the total cellular antioxidant capacity. The significant intracellular antioxidant activity observed with 1 pM baicalein means that it must be scavenging radicals that for some reason are not eliminated by the endogenous antioxidants. The strong antioxidant effects found suggest these flavones, as well as quercetin and similar polyphenolic antioxidants, at physiologically relevant concentrations act as redox mediators to enable endogenous antioxidants to reach and scavenge different pools of otherwise inaccessible radicals."

Although scientists have made great progress in developing this animal as a model for numerous areas of biomedical research, genomic resources for the baboon, such as a quality annotated genome, are still lacking. To this end, we characterized the baboon kidney transcriptome using high-throughput cDNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify genes, gene variants, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertion-deletion polymorphisms (InDels), cellular functions, and key pathways in the baboon kidney to provide a genomic resource for the baboon. Analysis of our sequencing data revealed 45,499 high-confidence SNPs and 29,813 InDels comparing baboon cDNA sequences with the human hg18 reference assembly and identified 35,900 cDNAs in the baboon kidney, including 35,150 transcripts representing 15,369 genic genes that are novel for the baboon. Gene ontology analysis of our sequencing dataset also identified numerous biological functions and canonical pathways that were significant in the baboon kidney, including a large number of metabolic pathways that support known functions of the kidney. The results presented in this study catalogues the transcribed mRNAs, noncoding RNAs, and hypothetical proteins in the baboon kidney and establishes a genomic resource for scientists using the baboon as an experimental model."
https://openalex.org/W2083348570,"Sumoylation is an important post-translational modification that alters the activity of many transcription factors. However, the mechanisms that link sumoylation to alterations in chromatin structure, which culminate in tissue specific gene expression, are not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrate that SUMO modification of the transcription factor Sharp-1 is required for its full transcriptional repression activity and function as an inhibitor of skeletal muscle differentiation. Sharp-1 is modified by sumoylation at two conserved lysine residues 240 and 255. Mutation of these SUMO acceptor sites in Sharp-1 does not impact its subcellular localization but attenuates its ability to act as a transcriptional repressor and inhibit myogenic differentiation. Consistently, co-expression of the SUMO protease SENP1 with wild type Sharp-1 abrogates Sharp-1-dependent inhibition of myogenesis. Interestingly, sumoylation acts as a signal for recruitment of the co-repressor G9a. Thus, enrichment of G9a, and histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation (H3K9me2), a signature of G9a activity, is dramatically reduced at muscle promoters in cells expressing sumoylation-defective Sharp-1. Our findings demonstrate how sumoylation of Sharp-1 exerts an impact on chromatin structure and transcriptional repression of muscle gene expression through recruitment of G9a."
https://openalex.org/W2171211861,"An attractive way to improve our understanding of sex determination evolution is to study the underlying mechanisms in closely related species and in a phylogenetic perspective. Hymenopterans are well suited owing to the diverse sex determination mechanisms, including different types of Complementary Sex Determination (CSD) and maternal control sex determination. We investigated different types of CSD in four species within the braconid wasp genus Asobara that exhibit diverse life-history traits. Nine to thirteen generations of inbreeding were monitored for diploid male production, brood size, offspring sex ratio, and pupal mortality as indicators for CSD. In addition, simulation models were developed to compare these observations to predicted patterns for multilocus CSD with up to ten loci. The inbreeding regime did not result in diploid male production, decreased brood sizes, substantially increased offspring sex ratios nor in increased pupal mortality. The simulations further allowed us to reject CSD with up to ten loci, which is a strong refutation of the multilocus CSD model. We discuss how the absence of CSD can be reconciled with the variation in life-history traits among Asobara species, and the ramifications for the phylogenetic distribution of sex determination mechanisms in the Hymenoptera."
https://openalex.org/W2040029428,"Protein-based vaccine development faces the difficult challenge of finding robust yet non-toxic adjuvants suitable for humans. Here, using a molecular engineering approach, we have developed a molecular platform for generating self-adjuvanting immunogens that do not depend on exogenous adjuvants for induction of immune responses. These are based on the concept of Immune Complex Mimics (ICM), structures that are formed between an oligomeric antigen and a monoclonal antibody (mAb) to that antigen. In this way, the roles of antigens and antibodies within the structure of immune complexes are reversed, so that a single monoclonal antibody, rather than polyclonal sera or expensive mAb cocktails can be used. We tested this approach in the context of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection by linking the highly immunogenic and potentially protective Ag85B with the oligomeric Acr (alpha crystallin, HspX) antigen. When combined with an anti-Acr monoclonal antibody, the fusion protein formed ICM which bound to C1q component of the complement system and were readily taken up by antigen-presenting cells in vitro. ICM induced a strong Th1/Th2 mixed type antibody response, which was comparable to cholera toxin adjuvanted antigen, but only moderate levels of T cell proliferation and IFN-γ secretion. Unfortunately, the systemic administration of ICM did not confer statistically significant protection against intranasal MTB challenge, although a small BCG-boosting effect was observed. We conclude that ICM are capable of inducing strong humoral responses to incorporated antigens and may be a suitable vaccination approach for pathogens other than MTB, where antibody-based immunity may play a more protective role."
https://openalex.org/W2062198693,"Age estimates, typically determined by counting periodic growth increments in calcified structures of vertebrates, are the basis of population dynamics models used for managing exploited or threatened species. In fisheries research, the use of otolith growth rings as an indicator of fish age has increased considerably in recent decades. However, otolith readings include various sources of uncertainty. Current ageing methods, which converts an average count of rings into age, only provide periodic age estimates in which the range of uncertainty is fully ignored. In this study, we describe a hierarchical model for estimating individual ages from repeated otolith readings. The model was developed within a Bayesian framework to explicitly represent the sources of uncertainty associated with age estimation, to allow for individual variations and to include knowledge on parameters from expertise. The performance of the proposed model was examined through simulations, and then it was coupled to a two-stanza somatic growth model to evaluate the impact of the age estimation method on the age composition of commercial fisheries catches. We illustrate our approach using the saggital otoliths of yellowfin tuna of the Indian Ocean collected through large-scale mark-recapture experiments. The simulation performance suggested that the ageing error model was able to estimate the ageing biases and provide accurate age estimates, regardless of the age of the fish. Coupled with the growth model, this approach appeared suitable for modeling the growth of Indian Ocean yellowfin and is consistent with findings of previous studies. The simulations showed that the choice of the ageing method can strongly affect growth estimates with subsequent implications for age-structured data used as inputs for population models. Finally, our modeling approach revealed particularly useful to reflect uncertainty around age estimates into the process of growth estimation and it can be applied to any study relying on age estimation."
https://openalex.org/W1985199369,"Transcription factors (TFs) often trigger developmental decisions, yet, their transcripts are often only moderately regulated and thus not easily detected by conventional statistics on expression data. Here we present a method that allows to determine such genes based on trajectory analysis of time-resolved transcriptome data. As a proof of principle, we have analysed apical stem cells of filamentous moss (P. patens) protonemata that develop from leaflets upon their detachment from the plant. By our novel correlation analysis of the post detachment transcriptome kinetics we predict five out of 1,058 TFs to be involved in the signaling leading to the establishment of pluripotency. Among the predicted regulators is the basic helix loop helix TF PpRSL1, which we show to be involved in the establishment of apical stem cells in P. patens. Our methodology is expected to aid analysis of key players of developmental decisions in complex plant and animal systems."
https://openalex.org/W2074133085,"Social networking services (e.g., Twitter, Facebook) are now major sources of World Wide Web (called “Web”) dynamics, together with Web search services (e.g., Google). These two types of Web services mutually influence each other but generate different dynamics. In this paper, we distinguish two modes of Web dynamics: the reactive mode and the default mode. It is assumed that Twitter messages (called “tweets”) and Google search queries react to significant social movements and events, but they also demonstrate signs of becoming self-activated, thereby forming a baseline Web activity. We define the former as the reactive mode and the latter as the default mode of the Web. In this paper, we investigate these reactive and default modes of the Web's dynamics using transfer entropy (TE). The amount of information transferred between a time series of 1,000 frequent keywords in Twitter and the same keywords in Google queries is investigated across an 11-month time period. Study of the information flow on Google and Twitter revealed that information is generally transferred from Twitter to Google, indicating that Twitter time series have some preceding information about Google time series. We also studied the information flow among different Twitter keywords time series by taking keywords as nodes and flow directions as edges of a network. An analysis of this network revealed that frequent keywords tend to become an information source and infrequent keywords tend to become sink for other keywords. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that frequent keywords form the Web's default mode, which becomes an information source for infrequent keywords that generally form the Web's reactive mode. We also found that the Web consists of different time resolutions with respect to TE among Twitter keywords, which will be another focal point of this paper."
https://openalex.org/W2080340906,"Background In a quest for a needle-free vaccine administration strategy, we evaluated the ocular conjunctiva as an alternative mucosal immunization route by profiling and comparing the local and systemic immune responses to the subcutaneous or conjunctival administration of tetanus toxoid (TTd), a model antigen. Materials and methods BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were immunized either subcutaneously with TTd alone or via the conjunctiva with TTd alone, TTd mixed with 2% glycerol or TTd with merthiolate-inactivated whole-cell B. pertussis (wBP) as adjuvants. Mice were immunized on days 0, 7 and 14 via both routes, and an evaluation of the local and systemic immune responses was performed two weeks after the last immunization. Four weeks after the last immunization, the mice were challenged with a lethal dose (2 × LD50) of tetanus toxin. Results The conjunctival application of TTd in BALB/c mice induced TTd-specific secretory IgA production and skewed the TTd-specific immune response toward a Th1/Th17 profile, as determined by the stimulation of IFNγ and IL-17A secretion and/or the concurrent pronounced reduction of IL-4 secretion, irrespective of the adjuvant. In conjunctivaly immunized C57BL/6 mice, only TTd administered with wBP promoted the establishment of a mixed Th1/Th17 TTd-specific immune response, whereas TTd alone or TTd in conjunction with glycerol initiated a dominant Th1 response against TTd. Immunization via the conjunctiva with TTd plus wBP adjuvant resulted in a 33% survival rate of challenged mice compared to a 0% survival rate in non-immunized animals (p<0.05). Conclusion Conjunctival immunization with TTd alone or with various adjuvants induced TTd-specific local and systemic immune responses, predominantly of the Th1 type. The strongest immune responses developed in mice that received TTd together with wBP, which implies that this alternative route might tailor the immune response to fight intracellular bacteria or viruses more effectively."
https://openalex.org/W1975870483,"The extent to which a species responds to environmental changes is mediated not only by extrinsic processes such as time and space, but also by species-specific ecology. The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau uplifted approximately 3000 m and experienced at least four major glaciations during the Pleistocene epoch in the Quaternary Period. Consequently, the area experienced concurrent changes in geomorphological structure and climate. Two species, the Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii, chiru) and Tibetan gazelle (Procapra picticaudata), both are endemic on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, where their habitats overlap, but have different migratory behaviors: the chiru is inclined to have female-biased dispersal with a breeding migration during the calving season; in contrast, Tibetan gazelles are year-round residents and never migrate distantly. By using coalescence methods we compared mitochondrial control region DNA sequences and variation at nine microsatellite loci in these two species. Coalescent simulations indicate that the chiru and Tibetan gazelle do not share concordant patterns in their genealogies. The non-migratory Tibetan gazelle, that is more vulnerable to the impact of drastic geographic changes such as the elevation of the plateau, glaciations and so on, appears to have a strong population genetic structure with complicated demographic history. Specifically, the Tibetan gazelle population appears to have experienced isolation and divergence with population fluctuations since the Middle Pleistocene (0.781 Ma). However, it showed continued decline since the Upper Pleistocene (0.126 Ma), which may be attributed to the irreversible impact of increased human activities on the plateau. In contrast, the migratory chiru appears to have simply experienced population expansion. With substantial gene flow among regional populations, this species shows no historical population isolation and divergence. Thus, this study adds to many empirical studies that show historical and contemporary extrinsic and intrinsic processes shape the recent evolutionary history and population genetic structure of species."
https://openalex.org/W1977822333,"Aberrant regulation of DNA damage checkpoint function leads to genome instability that in turn can predispose cellular tissues to become cancerous. Previous works from us and others demonstrated the role of Rad17 in either activation or termination of DNA damage checkpoint function. In the current study, we have revealed the unexpected accumulation of Rad17 in various types of breast cancer cell lines as well as human breast cancer tissues. We observed that Rad17 protein turnover rate in breast epithelial cells is much faster than in breast cancer cells, where the turnover of Rad17 is regulated by the Cdh1/APC pathway. We further observed that Rad17-mediated checkpoint function is modulated by proteolysis. Stabilization of Rad17 disrupts cellular response to chemotherapeutic drug-induced DNA damage and enhances cellular transformation. In addition, manipulation of Rad17 by RNA interference or stabilization of Rad17 significantly sensitize breast cancer cell to various chemotherapeutic drugs. Our present results indicate the manipulation of Rad17 proteolysis could be a valuable approach to sensitize breast cancer cell to the chemotherapeutic treatment despite of the critical role in governing DNA damage response and cellular recovery from genotoxic stress."
https://openalex.org/W1981097041,"In order to identify the optimal internal control for relative real-time PCR when studying target gene expression in the red alga Porphyra yezoensis, we quantified the expression of seven housekeeping genes (18S ribosomal RNA, 30S ribosomal protein S8, Polyubiquitin-2, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Elongation factor 1-alpha, Beta-tubulin and Actin 3) at different life-history stages. Absolute quantification was done by normalization to total RNA quantity and by normalization to genomic DNA quantity. We used these two normalization approaches, comparing the differences of expression levels of all candidate housekeeping genes between any two generations and across three life-history stages (filamentous sporophytes, leafy gametophytes and conchospores). We found GAPDH had the best stability in all cases and we recommend that GAPDH be considered as a potential internal control for gene expression studies at different life-history stages in P. yezoensis."
https://openalex.org/W2046404853,"The impact of physico-chemical factors on percent coral cover and coral health was examined on a spatial basis for two dominant Acropora species, A. digitifera and A. spicifera, at Ningaloo Reef (north-western Australia) in the southeast Indian Ocean. Coral health was investigated by measuring metabolic indices (RNA/DNA ratio and protein concentration), energy levels (lipid ratio) and autotrophic indices (chlorophyll a (chl a) and zooxanthellae density) at six stations during typical seasons (austral autumn 2010 (March and April), austral winter 2010 (August)) and during an extreme La Niña event in summer 2011 (February). These indices were correlated with 15 physico-chemical factors (measured immediately following coral sampling) to identify predictors for health indices. Variations in metabolic indices (protein concentration and RNA/DNA ratio) for A. spicifera were mainly explained by nitrogen, temperature and zooplankton concentrations under typical conditions, while for A. digitifera, light as well as phytoplankton, in particular picoeukaryotes, were important, possibly due to higher energy requirement for lipid synthesis and storage in A. digitifera. Optimum metabolic values occurred for both Acropora species at 26-28°C when autotrophic indices (chl a and zooxanthellae density) were lowest. The extreme temperature during the La Niña event resulted in a shift of feeding modes, with an increased importance of water column plankton concentrations for metabolic rates of A. digitifera and light and plankton for A. spicifera. Our results suggest that impacts of high sea surface temperatures during extreme events such as La Niña may be mitigated via reduction on metabolic rates in coral host. The high water column plankton concentrations and associated low light levels resulted in a shift towards high symbiont densities, with lower metabolic rates and energy levels than the seasonal norm for the coral host."
https://openalex.org/W2034411121,"Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Latent Membrane Protein 1 (LMP1) is linked to a variety of malignancies including Hodgkin's disease, lymphomas, nasopharyngeal and gastric carcinoma. LMP1 exerts its transforming or oncogenic activity mainly through the recruitment of intracellular adapters via LMP1 C-terminal Transformation Effector Sites (TES) 1 and 2. However, LMP1 is also reported to elicit significant cytotoxic effects in some other cell types. This cytotoxic effect is quite intriguing for an oncogenic protein, and it is unclear whether both functional aspects of the protein are related or mutually exclusive.Using different ectopic expression systems in both Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells and human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells, we observe that LMP1 ectopic expression massively induces cell death. Furthermore, we show that LMP1-induced cytotoxicity mainly implies LMP1 C-terminal transformation effector sites and TRADD recruitment. However, stable expression of LMP1 in the same cells, is found to be associated with an increase of cell survival and an acquisition of epithelial mesenchymal transition phenotype as evidenced by morphological modifications, increased cell mobility, increased expression of MMP9 and decreased expression of E-cadherin. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the cytotoxic and oncogenic effects of LMP1 are not mutually exclusive but may operate sequentially. We suggest that in a total cell population, cells resistant to LMP1-induced cytotoxicity are those that could take advantage of LMP1 oncogenic activity by integrating LMP1 signaling into the pre-existent signaling network. Our findings thus reconcile the apparent opposite apoptotic and oncogenic effects described for LMP1 and might reflect what actually happens on LMP1-induced cell transformation after EBV infection in patients."
https://openalex.org/W2051808519,"The cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae, produces pierisin-1, a protein inducing apoptosis of mammalian cells. In the present study, the biological activity of pierisin-1 as a protective agent against parasitic wasps for P. rapae was examined. Pierisin-1 caused detrimental effects on eggs and larvae of non-habitual parasitoids for P. rapae, Glyptapanteles pallipes, Cotesia kariyai and Cotesia plutellae at 1-100 µg/ml, levels essentially equivalent to those found in P. rapae larvae. In contrast, eggs and larvae of the natural parasitoid of P. rapae, Cotesia glomerata proved resistant to the toxicity of pierisin-1 through inhibition of pierisin-1 penetration of the surface layer. The expression level of pierisin-1 mRNA in the larvae of P. rapae was increased by parasitization by C. plutellae, whereas it was decreased by C. glomerata. In addition, C. plutellae was associated with elevation of activated pierisin-1 in the hemolymph. From these observations, it is suggested that pierisin-1 could contribute as a defense factor against parasitization by some type of wasps in P. rapae."
https://openalex.org/W1981413645,"Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein 1 (Creb1) is a transcription factor that mediates cyclic adenosine 3', 5'-monophosphate (cAMP) signalling in many tissues. Creb1(-/-) mice die at birth due to respiratory failure and previous genome-wide microarray analysis of E17.5 Creb1(-/-) fetal mouse lung identified important Creb1-regulated gene targets during lung development. The lipogenic enzymes stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1) and fatty acid synthase (Fasn) showed highly reduced gene expression in Creb1(-/-) lungs. We therefore hypothesized that Creb1 plays a crucial role in the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in pulmonary lipid biosynthetic pathways during lung development. In this study we confirmed that Scd1 and Fasn mRNA levels were down regulated in the E17.5 Creb1(-/-) mouse lung while the lipogenic-associated transcription factors SrebpF1, C/ebpα and Pparγ were increased. In vivo studies using germline (Creb1(-/-) ) and lung epithelial-specific (Creb1(EpiΔ/Δ) ) Creb1 knockout mice showed strongly reduced Scd1, but not Fasn gene expression and protein levels in lung epithelial cells. In vitro studies using mouse MLE-15 epithelial cells showed that forskolin-mediated activation of Creb1 increased both Scd1 gene expression and protein synthesis. Additionally, MLE15 cells transfected with a dominant-negative ACreb vector blocked forskolin-mediated stimulation of Scd1 gene expression. Lipid profiling in MLE15 cells showed that dominant-negative ACreb suppressed forskolin-induced desaturation of ether linked lipids to produce plasmalogens, as well as levels of phosphatidylethanolamine, ceramide and lysophosphatidylcholine. Taken together these results demonstrate that Creb1 is essential for the induction and maintenance of Scd1 in developing fetal mouse lung epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2068250869,"Health providers have played important roles on delivering prevention and care services to control syphilis in China. The current study was aimed to evaluate the performance of different health providers in providing outreach syphilis testing services to female sex workers (FSWs). The current study carried out during April to August 2009 in Liuzhou was aimed to investigate the services delivered by two different types of clinics in China. A total of 1,808 FSWs recruited from sex work venues were included in the study. Prevalence of positive syphilis test (6.4%) among FSWs accessed by the local center for disease control outreach teams (CDC teams) was significantly lower than that (9.3%) among FSWs accessed by the local reproductive health hospital outreach teams (RHH teams). As compared with CDC teams, RHH teams had more FSWs to be successfully referred to the designated STD clinics for further syphilis confirmation and intervention (85.7% vs. 26.7%, P<0.001). These findings indicate that RHH teams may be more efficient than CDC teams to provide outreach-based services to FSWs. Participation of the reproductive health providers or other medical facilities in outreach services to FSWs should be considered in developing intervention programs in China."
