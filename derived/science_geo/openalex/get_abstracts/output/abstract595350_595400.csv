Thubagere et al. developed a simple algorithm for recognizing two types of molecular cargoes and their drop-off destinations on the surface (see the Perspective by Reif). The DNA robot, which has three modular functional domains, repeatedly picks up the two types of molecules and then places them at their target destinations. No additional power is required because the DNA robot does this by random walking across the origami surface. Science , this issue p. eaan6558 ; see also p. 1095"
https://openalex.org/W2756375591,"Understanding the detailed dynamics of neuronal networks will require the simultaneous measurement of spike trains from hundreds of neurons (or more). Currently, approaches to extracting spike times and labels from raw data are time consuming, lack standardization, and involve manual intervention, making it difficult to maintain data provenance and assess the quality of scientific results. Here, we describe an automated clustering approach and associated software package that addresses these problems and provides novel cluster quality metrics. We show that our approach has accuracy comparable to or exceeding that achieved using manual or semi-manual techniques with desktop central processing unit (CPU) runtimes faster than acquisition time for up to hundreds of electrodes. Moreover, a single choice of parameters in the algorithm is effective for a variety of electrode geometries and across multiple brain regions. This algorithm has the potential to enable reproducible and automated spike sorting of larger scale recordings than is currently possible."

Thus, the means by which the interphase expression pattern is transduced to daughter cells have been unclear. We used 5-ethynyluridine to pulse-label transcripts during mitosis and mitotic exit and found that many genes exhibit transcription during mitosis, as confirmed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-uridine 5'-triphosphate labeling, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The first round of transcription immediately after mitosis primarily activates genes involved in the growth and rebuilding of daughter cells, rather than cell type-specific functions. We propose that the cell's transcription pattern is largely retained at a low level through mitosis, whereas the amplitude of transcription observed in interphase is reestablished during mitotic exit."

Further, artificially stimulating or inhibiting dopamine neurons for very brief periods is sufficient to mimic the effects of endogenous positive or negative prediction errors (Chang et al., 2016Chang C.Y.

This body of work leaves little doubt that brief phasic changes in the activity of dopamine neurons can act like reward prediction errors, at least in some downstream targets and behavioral paradigms (Glimcher, 2011Glimcher P.W.

This is an important question because the cached-value errors in model-free reinforcement learning algorithms support only a relatively limited subset of error-driven learning. For example, cached-value errors would not occur in situations in which value remains the same but the specific properties of the predicted event change. Such learning occurs commonly in our daily lives and can be isolated in experimental procedures such as identity or transreinforcer unblocking and sensory preconditioning (Brogden, 1947Brogden W.J.

The existence of these value-neutral forms of learning (and the fact that they can be blocked) suggests that there must be some mechanism for signaling the underlying sensory or identity prediction errors. Here we tested whether the dopamine neurons might signal such errors and whether such signals would be dissociable from classic value-based prediction errors at the level of individual dopamine neurons. We recorded single-unit activity from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of awake, behaving rats. Dopamine neurons were identified by means of a cluster analysis based on spike duration and amplitude ratio, features similar to those used to distinguish dopamine neurons in primates (Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010bBromberg-Martin E.S.

Dopamine responses comply with basic assumptions of formal learning theory.Nature. 2001; 412: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). The cluster analysis identified 81 of 473 neurons recorded in the VTA of the experimental group as dopaminergic (n = 8; Figure 1A). These neurons had a significantly lower amplitude ratio (Figure 1B) and longer spike duration (Figure 1C) than neurons in other clusters (amplitude ratio, t test, t471 = 15.84, p < 0.01; spike duration, t test, t471 = 24.55, p < 0.01). This cluster analysis has been shown previously to isolate wide-waveform neurons in rat VTA whose firing is sensitive to intravenous infusion of apomorphine or quinpirole (Jo et al., 2013Jo Y.S.

Neurosci. 2013; 33: 8159-8171Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, Roesch et al., 2007Roesch M.R. Calu D.J. Schoenbaum G. Dopamine neurons encode the better option in rats deciding between differently delayed or sized rewards.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1615-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), and nigral neurons identified by a similar cluster analysis in mice are selectively activated by optical stimulation in tyrosine hydroxylase channelrhodopsin-2 mutants and show reduced bursting in tyrosine hydroxylase striatal-specific NMDAR1 knockouts (Jin and Costa, 2010Jin X. Costa R.M. Start/stop signals emerge in nigrostriatal circuits during sequence learning.Nature. 2010; 466: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). These features suggest that the wide-waveform neurons identified in this manner are dopamine neurons, an assertion further confirmed here by the selective elimination of nearly all wide-waveform neurons from recordings made in a separate group of TH-Cre rats that received ipsilateral infusions of a Casp3 neurotoxin (AAV1-Flex-taCasp3-TEVp) into VTA immediately prior to electrode implantation to destroy TH+ neurons (n = 5; Figures 1A–1C, red). Neurons in the experimental group (Figure 1A) were recorded during performance of an odor-guided choice task in which the rats sampled one of three different odor cues at a central port and then had to respond at either a left or right well to receive a big (three drop) or a small (one drop) amount of one of two equally preferred flavored milk solutions (chocolate or vanilla; Figures 2A–2C). One odor signaled reward in the left well (forced choice left), a second odor signaled reward in the right well (forced choice right), and a third odor signaled the availability of reward at either well (free choice). Rats were trained on the task prior to the start of recording, and during the recording sessions, we independently manipulated value or identity across blocks of trials by switching either the number or flavor of the reward delivered at each well (Figure 2B). The rats responded to these manipulations by selecting the high value reward more often on free choice trials (Figures 2D and 2E) and by responding faster and more accurately when the high value reward was at stake on forced choice trials (Figures 2F and 2G). Notably, these large changes in behavior were observed irrespective of reward identity. Accordingly, ANOVAs revealed main effects of changes in number on each of these measures (F’s > 91.9, p’s < 0.0001), but there were no main effects or any interactions with changes in flavor (F’s < 2.1, p’s > 0.15). We also monitored licking behavior during reward delivery, which did not differ based on number or flavor (Figure 2H). Given the apparent lack of any effect of reward identity on the rats’ behavior, we also examined these measures immediately before versus after changes in reward to make certain that the rats were attending to the feature (number or flavor) that was shifted (see STAR Methods for details). Neural data acquired in blocks in which none of these measures showed any significant change in the initial trials after a shift were excluded from the subsequent analysis. This amounted to 10 number shift blocks and 100 identity shift blocks. Importantly, the value-based behaviors illustrated in Figure 2A did not differ in these blocks (Figure S1). Sixty neurons out of 81 putative dopamine neurons in the experimental group increased firing to reward. As in prior studies (Roesch et al., 2007Roesch M.R. Calu D.J. Schoenbaum G.

Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1615-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, Takahashi et al., 2011Takahashi Y.K. Roesch M.R. Wilson R.C. Toreson K. O’Donnell P. Niv Y. Schoenbaum G.

Temporal specificity of reward prediction errors signaled by putative dopamine neurons in rat VTA depends on ventral striatum.Neuron. 2016; 91: 182-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), classic value-based prediction error signaling was observed almost exclusively in these reward-responsive putative dopamine neurons. These reward-responsive neurons (n = 60) changed firing in response to shifts in reward number at the start of blocks 2 and 4, increasing specifically to unexpected delivery of the second drop of reward at one well (Figure 3A) and decreasing to omission of the expected second drop of reward at the other well (Figure 3B). Changes in firing were not observed to the delivery or omission of the third drop of reward. This is consistent with signaling of the underlying prediction error, since in this experiment (unlike our prior studies) the third drop was always delivered after the second drop, so its occurrence or omission was fully predicted by the presence or absence of the second drop. To quantify these changes, we computed difference scores for each neuron, comparing the average firing at the beginning versus the end of the number shift blocks at the time of delivery or omission of each potential drop of reward. Distributions of these scores were shifted above zero when an unexpected second reward was delivered (Figure 3C, middle) and below zero when an expected second reward was omitted (Figure 3D, middle), but remained unchanged in the time windows related to the first (Figures 3C and 3D, left) and third drops of reward (Figures 3C and 3D, right). Changes in firing to second reward were maximal at the beginning of the block and then diminished with learning (Figure 3E; ANOVAs, F’s > 2.00, p’s < 0.05), and the changes in firing to unexpected delivery and omission of the second drop were inversely correlated in individual neurons (Figure 3F). There were no changes in firing across trials at the time of delivery or omission of the other drops of reward (Figure 3E; ANOVAs, F’s < 1.80, p’s > 0.05). The above findings are consistent with current proposals that dopamine neurons signal a bidirectional prediction error reflecting changes in value (Figure 5A). Yet clearly many other features that are independent of value change when a new reward is delivered or an expected reward is omitted. To test whether dopamine neurons might also reflect errors in the prediction of these other features, we analyzed activity in the reward-responsive dopamine neurons in response to shifts in reward identity in blocks 3 and 5 (Figure 2B). We quantified changes in firing to the identity shifts by again computing difference scores for each neuron, in this case comparing firing in response to the new reward at the start of the new block versus the old reward at the end of the prior block. This analysis revealed marked changes in the population responses, which increased to the new reward (Figures 4A and 4B ), and in the distributions of scores comparing firing before and after the identity shift, which were shifted significantly above zero for both the first and second drops of the big reward (Figure 4C, left and middle) and for the single drop of the small reward (Figure 4D, left). These increases were generally maximal immediately after the identity shift, and diminished rapidly on subsequent trials (Figure 4E, black line; ANOVA, F = 2.40, p = 0.01), as would be expected if the firing changes reflected errors in prediction of the new reward. Notably, there was no change in firing to the third drop of the big reward (Figure 4C, right), which again was fully predicted in both value and identity by the preceding second drop. What do these changes mean? Are dopamine neurons signaling something other than cached-value errors, or is there another explanation for the apparent error signals in the identity blocks in the current design? One alternative explanation is that the signals reflect salience or perhaps a value “bonus” due to the novelty of the new reward (Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010aBromberg-Martin E.S. Matsumoto M. Hikosaka O. Dopamine in motivational control: rewarding, aversive, and alerting.Neuron. 2010; 68: 815-834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar, Horvitz, 2000Horvitz J.C.

Two types of dopamine neuron distinctly convey positive and negative motivational signals.Nature. 2009; 459: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, Schultz, 2016Schultz W. Dopamine reward prediction-error signalling: a two-component response.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2016; 17: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). If the new flavor is novel or highly salient compared to the old reward, then each drop would induce a cached-value error or salience signal (Figure 5B). Yet on its face, this does not seem likely. The rats have had extensive experience with the two rewards in each well, the blocks are short and interspersed daily, and the rewards are available on interleaved trials within each block. Thus, it seems unlikely that such large differences in firing (as large or larger than elicited by additional reward) would be driven by such trivial differences in moment-to-moment exposure. In addition, at least two pieces of evidence contradict this account. First, while we did observe increased firing to the small reward and to the first and second drops of the big reward, we did not observe increased firing to the third drop of the big reward. This drop should be equally imbued with novelty or salience due to flavor, so the data do not completely match the predictions of this account. Second, the changes in firing in the identity shift blocks were correlated with the reward-prediction error signals in the number shift blocks (Figure 4F). This relationship—especially the inverse correlation with the negative error signals (Figure 4F, red)—is not consistent with the proposal that these neurons are signaling salience in response to changes in reward identity, since reward omission is also a salient event. A second and more interesting alternative explanation for the apparent error signals in the identity blocks is that the rats might be using the identity of the rewards themselves as predictors of the number of drops that will be delivered. While this is not possible when different amounts of the same reward are used at both wells, when two different rewards are used, then the identity of the initial drop can be used to predict whether subsequent drops are likely to follow (NB: this mechanism does not apply if the two wells deliver similar amounts of different reward, and as illustrated in Figure S2, dopamine neurons also exhibited correlated changes in firing in response to number and identity shifts under these conditions). If the rats attend to this information, then by the end of a trial block, the flavor of the initial drop of the big reward should have a higher value than the flavor of the initial drop of the small reward because the former predicts two more rewarding drops, while the latter signals the absence of any further drops of reward. Any difference in value carried by the initial drop of the two rewards would induce cached-value errors (Figure 5C), which would confound the identity errors that were the a priori target of the current design. This mechanism would explain the increased firing to the small reward after an identity shift as unexpected increase in its value (Figure 5C). The lack of suppression of firing thereafter to the missing subsequent drops could reflect the relative weakness of the underlying prediction and the difficulty measuring suppression of firing in neurons with such low firing rates. However, by the same logic, the first drop of the big reward should initially be less valuable because its flavor predicted no further reward in the prior block (Figure 5C, red box). Thus, a negative value-prediction error should occur in response to the first drop, followed by positive errors to the subsequent, unexpected drops. The firing of the dopamine neurons complied with these predictions for the second drop, but not for the first drop. Instead, rather than showing suppression, as these same neurons did when reward was omitted in the number shift blocks, they did the opposite in identity shift blocks, showing a dramatic increase in firing to the critical first drop of the new big reward (Figures 4A and 4C). Indeed, the increase in firing to the first drop of the small reward was positively correlated with the increase in firing to the first drop of the big reward for individual neurons in individual blocks (r = 0.35, p < 0.01). While increased firing to the first drop of the big reward is the opposite of what is predicted for a cached-value error computed using outcome flavor as a predictor of subsequent reward, it is exactly what is expected for a prediction error based on changes in identity or sensory information. In fact, the first drop of the large reward turns out to be the only place in the design where the predictions for a cached-value error unambiguously diverge from those for a sensory or identity prediction error (Figure 5D, red box). Elsewhere, the predictions of the two accounts are arguably similar, if not identical. For example, in the identity shift blocks, both a sensory-based and a value-based account predict increased firing when the small reward is presented and when the second drop of the big reward is delivered because in both cases there is novel sensory information and excess, unpredicted value. Both also predict no change in firing to the third drop, as its flavor and value are as expected based on the preceding drops. The predictions of the two accounts are also aligned in the number shift blocks; each predicts increased firing to the additional second drop of reward in these blocks, since again there is excess value but also substantial unpredicted sensory information. Further, both predict decreased firing upon omission of the second drop of reward since there is less value than expected but also a loss of expected sensory input that is not offset by the addition of a new reward. Midbrain dopamine neurons have been proposed to signal prediction errors as defined in model-free reinforcement learning algorithms (Schultz et al., 1997Schultz W. Dayan P. Montague P.R.

Here we have shown that dopamine neurons that exhibit classic error-like responses to changes in reward value show similar signals to changes in its sensory features. The changes in firing to value and identity did not occur in unique populations of neurons, nor were the identity-based changes in firing easily explicable as reflecting novelty or salience. Further, in the one area of the task design in which the identity and value accounts cannot be reconciled, the first drop of the large reward (Figures 5C and 5D, red boxes), the firing of the dopamine neurons did the opposite of what a cached-value hypothesis would predict.

https://openalex.org/W2951297094,"Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the primary motor cortex (M1) can excite both cortico-cortical and cortico-spinal axons resulting in TMS-evoked potentials (TEPs) and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), respectively. Despite this remarkable difference with other cortical areas, the influence of motor output and its amplitude on TEPs is largely unknown. Here we studied TEPs resulting from M1 stimulation and assessed whether their waveform and spectral features depend on the MEP amplitude. To this aim, we performed two separate experiments. In experiment 1, single-pulse TMS was applied at the same supra-threshold intensity on primary motor, prefrontal, premotor and parietal cortices and the corresponding TEPs were compared by means of local mean field power and time-frequency spectral analysis. In experiment 2 we stimulated M1 at resting motor threshold in order to elicit MEPs characterized by a wide range of amplitudes. TEPs computed from high-MEP and low-MEP trials were then compared using the same methods applied in experiment 1. In line with previous studies, TMS of M1 produced larger TEPs compared to other cortical stimulations. Notably, we found that only TEPs produced by M1 stimulation were accompanied by a late event-related desynchronization (ERD—peaking at ~300 ms after TMS), whose magnitude was strongly dependent on the amplitude of MEPs. Overall, these results suggest that M1 produces peculiar responses to TMS possibly reflecting specific anatomo-functional properties, such as the re-entry of proprioceptive feedback associated with target muscle activation."

Optogenetic, chemogenetic, genetic, and pharmacological interrogation suggested that downregulation of cortico-STN transmission in PD mice was triggered by increased striato-pallidal transmission, leading to disinhibition of the STN and increased activation of STN NMDA receptors. Knockdown of STN NMDA receptors, which also suppresses proliferation of GABAergic pallido-STN inputs in PD mice, reduced loss of cortico-STN transmission and patterning and improved motor function. Together, the data suggest that loss of dopamine triggers a maladaptive shift in the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition in the STN, which contributes to parkinsonian activity and motor dysfunction.

The glutamatergic subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a key element of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop, a brain circuit critical for movement control and a major site of dysfunction in psychomotor disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Huntington’s disease (Albin et al., 1989Albin R.L.

The STN is a component of two pathways that facilitate the initiation, execution, and termination of appropriate actions through elevation of GABAergic basal ganglia output: the hyperdirect pathway, where cortical excitation is relayed to the output nuclei by the STN, and the indirect pathway, which traverses the striatum, external globus pallidus (GPe), and STN (Albin et al., 1989Albin R.L.

Theoretical studies suggest that cortico-STN transmission contributes not only to pathological STN activity but also to abnormally persistent and widespread β band activity throughout the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop in PD (Moran et al., 2011Moran R.J.

Biol. 2015; 11: e1004609Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Increased activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) at cortico-STN synapses could therefore promote LTP of cortical inputs (Chu et al., 2015Chu H.Y. Atherton J.F. Wokosin D. Surmeier D.J. Bevan M.D. Heterosynaptic regulation of external globus pallidus inputs to the subthalamic nucleus by the motor cortex.Neuron. 2015; 85: 364-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Indeed, STN neurons exhibit an increase in the ratio of AMPA receptor (AMPAR) to NMDAR current (Shen and Johnson, 2005Shen K.Z. Johnson S.W. Dopamine depletion alters responses to glutamate and GABA in the rat subthalamic nucleus.Neuroreport. 2005; 16: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and GPe-STN synapses proliferate through NMDAR-dependent heterosynaptic plasticity in PD rodents (Chu et al., 2015Chu H.Y. Atherton J.F. Wokosin D. Surmeier D.J. Bevan M.D. Heterosynaptic regulation of external globus pallidus inputs to the subthalamic nucleus by the motor cortex.Neuron. 2015; 85: 364-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, in parkinsonian monkeys a decrease in the number of cortico-STN inputs has been reported (Mathai et al., 2015Mathai A. Ma Y. Paré J.F. Villalba R.M. Wichmann T. Smith Y. Reduced cortical innervation of the subthalamic nucleus in MPTP-treated parkinsonian monkeys.Brain. 2015; 138: 946-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that cortico-STN transmission may be mediated by fewer but potentially more powerful inputs following loss of dopamine. The balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition in neuronal networks is critical to their performance and is controlled by long-term and/or homeostatic plasticity (Malenka and Nicoll, 1999Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Long-term potentiation—a decade of progress?.Science. 1999; 285: 1870-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (2236) Google Scholar, Turrigiano, 2011Turrigiano G. Too many cooks? Intrinsic and synaptic homeostatic mechanisms in cortical circuit refinement.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 34: 89-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). These plasticities optimize information processing and storage under normal conditions but in disease states can produce maladaptive changes, which compromise both network performance and behavior. We therefore tested three hypotheses using the chronic, unilateral, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesion mouse model of mid- to late-stage PD: (1) the properties of cortico-STN synaptic inputs are modified following loss of dopamine; (2) cortico-STN synaptic plasticity is triggered by elevated striato-pallidal transmission, leading to disinhibition of the STN and increased activation of STN NMDARs; and (3) an abnormal balance of cortico-STN excitation relative to GPe-STN inhibition impairs motor function. Data are reported as median and interquartile range. Boxplots illustrate the median (central line), interquartile range (box), and 10%–90% range (whiskers) of the data. Unpaired and paired non-parametric statistical comparisons were made using the Mann-Whitney U test and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, respectively. The Holm-Bonferroni method was applied to correct for multiple comparisons. p < 0.05 was considered significant. The physiological properties of motor cortico-STN transmission were compared in brain slices from 6-OHDA-injected, dopamine-depleted, and vehicle-injected dopamine-intact mice using optogenetic stimulation and patch-clamp recording. Cortico-STN excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were evoked at −80 mV to isolate AMPAR-mediated transmission (Chu et al., 2015Chu H.Y. Atherton J.F. Wokosin D. Surmeier D.J. Bevan M.D. Heterosynaptic regulation of external globus pallidus inputs to the subthalamic nucleus by the motor cortex.Neuron. 2015; 85: 364-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The amplitude of cortico-STN transmission was diminished across a range of stimulation intensities in slices from dopamine-depleted mice relative to control mice (e.g., EPSC amplitude at 2.6 mW/mm2, vehicle = 488, 405–552 pA, n = 18 neurons, 3 mice; 6-OHDA = 129, 103–242 pA, n = 16 neurons, 3 mice; p < 0.05; Figures 1A–1D). The ratio of EPSC2 (stimulated 100 ms after EPSC1) to EPSC1 was similar in slices from dopamine-depleted versus dopamine-intact mice (e.g., EPSC2:EPSC1 at 2.6 mW/mm2, vehicle = 0.81, 0.61–0.86, n = 18 neurons, 3 mice; 6-OHDA = 0.75, 0.54–1.07, n = 16 neurons, 3 mice; p > 0.05; Figures 1E and 1F), arguing that a lower initial probability of transmission was not responsible for reduced cortico-STN transmission. Asynchronous cortico-STN transmission, optogenetically evoked in the presence of Sr2+, was compared in slices from dopamine-depleted versus dopamine-intact mice. Both the frequency (vehicle = 14.9, 7.8–24.9 Hz, n = 24 neurons, 4 mice; 6-OHDA = 5.9, 3.8–10.6 Hz, n = 19 neurons, 4 mice; p < 0.05; Figures 1G and 1H) and the amplitude (vehicle = 12.6, 10.8–19.6 pA, n = 24 neurons, 4 mice; 6-OHDA = 10.8, 9.7–12.0 pA, n = 19 neurons, 4 mice; p < 0.05; Figures 1G and 1I) of asynchronous transmission were reduced following dopamine depletion. Together, these data suggest that, following the loss of dopamine, the strength of AMPAR-mediated cortico-STN transmission decreases, largely through a reduction in the number of functional inputs. To determine the impact of dopamine depletion on cortico-STN innervation, immersion-fixed brain slices from 6-OHDA and vehicle-injected mice were processed for the immunohistochemical detection of vesicular glutamate transporter type 1 (vGluT1), a predominantly cortical axon terminal marker that is not expressed by subcortical afferents of the STN (Barroso-Chinea et al., 2008Barroso-Chinea P.

Neurosci. 2009; 29: 340-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The densities of vGluT1-immunoreactive puncta in the STN were then determined stereologically (West, 1999West M.J. Stereological methods for estimating the total number of neurons and synapses: issues of precision and bias.Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 51-61Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Consistent with non-human primate data (Mathai et al., 2015Mathai A. Ma Y. Paré J.F. Villalba R.M. Wichmann T. Smith Y. Reduced cortical innervation of the subthalamic nucleus in MPTP-treated parkinsonian monkeys.Brain. 2015; 138: 946-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the density of vGluT1-immunoreactive puncta was lower in slices from dopamine-depleted versus dopamine-intact mice (vehicle = 19.2, 15.1–23.7 million/mm3, n = 31 samples, 8 mice; 6-OHDA = 13.2, 8.8–14.7 million/mm3; n = 30 samples, 8 mice; p < 0.05; Figures 2A–2C). No alteration in the area of the STN was observed (vehicle = 0.24, 0.20–0.28 mm2, n = 14 slices, 8 mice; 6-OHDA = 0.20, 0.17–0.24 mm2; n = 14 slices, 8 mice; p > 0.05). Cortico-STN axon terminals synapse with distal dendrites and to a lesser degree with dendritic spines (Bevan et al., 1995Bevan M.D. Francis C.M. Bolam J.P. The glutamate-enriched cortical and thalamic input to neurons in the subthalamic nucleus of the rat: convergence with GABA-positive terminals.J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 361: 491-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To determine whether dopamine depletion produced corresponding postsynaptic alterations, the morphologies of Golgi-impregnated STN neurons in tissue from perfuse-fixed 6-OHDA-injected and vehicle-injected mice were compared (Figures 2D–2K). Three-dimensional, morphometric analysis confirmed several alterations in dopamine-depleted mice: (1) there were fewer dendritic branches at distances greater than 30 μm from the soma (e.g., dendrites intersecting a 50 μm diameter sphere centered on the soma: vehicle = 5, 4–6; n = 26 neurons, 3 mice; 6-OHDA = 3, 2–4; n = 26 neurons, 3 mice; p < 0.05; Figures 2D–2F and 2H); (2) the total dendritic length was shorter (vehicle = 421, 307–558 μm; n = 26 neurons, 3 mice; 6-OHDA = 294, 261–375 μm; n = 26 neurons, 3 mice; p < 0.05; Figures 2D–2F and 2I); and (3) there were fewer dendritic spines (vehicle = 21, 5–31; n = 26 neurons, 3 mice; 6-OHDA = 8, 5–16; n = 26 neurons, 3 mice; p < 0.05; Figures 2G, 2J, and 2K). Together these data demonstrate that both cortico-STN axon terminals and their postsynaptic targets were eliminated following loss of dopamine. Plasticity and pathological processes can modulate the strength and nature of glutamatergic transmission through changes in GluA2 AMPAR subunit expression (Isaac et al., 2007Isaac J.T. Ashby M.C.

The pharmacological and biophysical properties of cortico-STN synapses were therefore assessed. Cortico-STN EPSCs optogenetically evoked at −80 mV were relatively sensitive to the Ca2+-permeable AMPAR antagonist 1-Naphthyl acetyl spermine trihydrochloride (Naspm; 100 μM) in slices from 6-OHDA-injected mice (Naspm inhibition: vehicle = 38.7, 24.5%–42.5%; n = 8 neurons, 3 mice; 6-OHDA = 57.4, 53.3%–60.8%; n = 7 neurons, 4 mice; p < 0.05; Figures 3A and 3B ), implying a reduction in GluA2 expression. Consistent with reduced GluA2 expression, AMPAR-mediated cortico-STN transmission in the presence of the NMDAR antagonist D-APV (50 μM) was faster (τdecay: vehicle = 6.8, 4.6–7.8 ms; n = 18 neurons, 3 mice; 6-OHDA = 4.0, 3.3–5.0 ms; n = 16 neurons, 3 mice; p < 0.05; Figures 3C and 3D), and inward rectification was stronger in 6-OHDA-treated mice (EPSC amplitude at −80 mV/+40 mV: vehicle = 1.7, 1.3–2.7; n = 30 neurons, 7 mice; 6-OHDA = 2.4, 1.9–3.5; n = 31 neurons, 6 mice; p < 0.05; Figures 3C and 3E). Together, these data suggest that, following loss of dopamine, cortico-STN AMPAR-mediated transmission undergoes associated molecular and biophysical alterations. No change in AMPAR:NMDAR ratio was observed (Figure S1). Repeated optogenetic driving of cortico-STN transmission in dopamine-intact mouse brain slices can lead to NMDAR-dependent LTP, most likely through insertion of postsynaptic AMPAR subunits (Chu et al., 2015Chu H.Y. Atherton J.F. Wokosin D. Surmeier D.J.

Loss of dopamine prevents or alters the induction of synaptic plasticity in the striatum (Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011Gerfen C.R. Surmeier D.J. Modulation of striatal projection systems by dopamine.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2011; 34: 441-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). To determine whether dopamine depletion affects LTP in the STN, cortico-STN EPSCs were compared 5 min before and 35–40 min after an optogenetic stimulation protocol shown to induce LTP (1 ms light pulses delivered at 50 Hz for 300 ms, with stimulus trains repeated 30 times at 0.2 Hz; Chu et al., 2015Chu H.Y. Atherton J.F. Wokosin D. Surmeier D.J.

LTP was induced in slices from dopamine-intact (median EPSC amplitude post-induction relative to pre-induction: vehicle = 134.5, 108.3%–151.5%; n = 7 neurons, 5 mice; p < 0.05; Figure 3F), but not dopamine-depleted mice (6-OHDA = 79.7, 54.9%–90.5%; n = 10 neurons, 5 mice; p > 0.05; Figure 3G). LTP was not rescued by application of 0.5–1.0 μM dopamine (99.7, 82.2%–102.8%; n = 8 neurons, 4 mice; p > 0.05; Figure 3H). Thus, the capacity for LTP of cortico-STN transmission is impaired in PD mice. To determine the impact of dopamine depletion on cortico-STN β band patterning, the effects of optogenetic stimulation (15 Hz in 1 ms pulses for 1 s at an intensity of 1.0 mW/mm2) of cortico-STN axon terminals on STN activity were compared in slices from 6-OHDA- and vehicle-injected mice. β band stimulation of each STN neuron was repeated three times at a frequency of 0.033 Hz. STN neurons were recorded in the loose-seal, cell-attached configuration to minimize perturbation of their firing. The number of cortically generated action potentials (synaptic drive) was defined using peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) as those exceeding the mean plus 3 SD of action potential counts in the 2 s preceding stimulation. The spontaneous firing of STN neurons (Atherton et al., 2008Atherton J.F. Wokosin D.L. Ramanathan S. Bevan M.D. Autonomous initiation and propagation of action potentials in neurons of the subthalamic nucleus.J. Physiol. 2008; 586: 5679-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) decreased in frequency (vehicle = 11.6, 8.2–13.9 Hz; n = 17 neurons, 4 mice; 6-OHDA = 2.7, 0–8.5 Hz; n = 17 neurons, 4 mice; p < 0.05; Figures 4A–4E) and regularity (CV: vehicle = 0.12, 0.10–0.18; n = 16 neurons, 4 mice; 6-OHDA = 0.43, 0.16–0.58; n = 10 neurons, 4 mice; p < 0.05; Figures 4A–4E) following loss of dopamine, consistent with previous observations (Wilson et al., 2006Wilson C.L.

In neurons from 6-OHDA-injected mice, (1) the number of cortically generated action potentials was lower (synaptic drive: vehicle = 31, 20–41; n = 17 neurons, 4 mice; 6-OHDA = 15, 9–23; n = 17 neurons, 4 mice; p < 0.05; Figures 4A–4D and 4F) and (2) the latencies and interquartile ranges of latencies of cortically stimulated action potentials were increased (latency: vehicle = 3.7, 2.5–6.3 ms; n = 17 neurons, 4 mice; 6-OHDA = 18.2, 11.6–31.6 ms; n = 17 neurons, 4 mice; p < 0.05; Figures 4A, 4B, and 4F) (interquartile range of latency: vehicle = 0.9, 0.5–3.5 ms; n = 17 neurons, 4 mice; 6-OHDA = 13.0, 8.4–24.9 ms; n = 17 neurons, 4 mice; p < 0.05; Figures 4A, 4B, and 4F). The reduced effectiveness of cortico-STN patterning in terms of the number, latency, and temporal precision of synaptically generated action potentials is consistent with the reduction in cortico-STN transmission strength following loss of dopamine. To determine the relative contribution of AMPAR- and NMDAR-mediated transmission to cortico-STN patterning, a subset of neurons was administered the NMDAR antagonist D-APV (50 μM), first alone and then together with the AMPAR antagonist GYKI 53655 (50 μM). In STN neurons from both vehicle- and 6-OHDA-injected mice, only AMPAR antagonism reduced and delayed cortical generation of action potentials (synaptic drive: vehicle, control = 34, 30–44; vehicle, D-APV = 35, 21–44; n = 7 neurons, 4 mice; p > 0.05; vehicle, GYKI 53655 = 2, 0–8; n = 7 neurons, 4 mice; p < 0.05; 6-OHDA, control = 21, 15–44; 6-OHDA, D-APV = 24, 14–38; n = 8 neurons, 4 mice; p > 0.05; 6-OHDA, GYKI 53655 = 0, 0–3; n = 8 neurons, 4 mice; p < 0.05; Figures 4G–4I) (latency: vehicle, control = 3.5, 2.5–4.4 ms; vehicle, D-APV = 3.4, 2.8–4.2 ms; n = 7 neurons, 4 mice; p > 0.05; vehicle, GYKI 53655 = 31.9, 20.5–35.6 ms; n = 7 neurons, 4 mice; p < 0.05; 6-OHDA, control = 11.6, 9.1–17.0 ms; 6-OHDA, D-APV = 12.3, 6.1–18.0 ms; n = 8 neurons, 4 mice; p > 0.05; 6-OHDA, GYKI 53655 = 31.6, 30.2–33.7 ms; n = 6 neurons, 4 mice; p < 0.05; Figures 4G, 4H, and 4J), consistent with the relatively large magnitude of AMPAR- versus NMDAR-mediated EPSCs at subthreshold voltages (Chu et al., 2015Chu H.Y.

We used multi-site recording to look for evidence of local clustering and laminar consistency of linear and angular velocity encoding in multi-neuronal spiking activity (MUA) and in the high-frequency (300-900 Hz) component of the local field potential (HF-LFP), believed to reflect local spiking activity. Rats were trained to run many trials on a large circular platform, either to LED-cued goal locations or as a spatial sequence from memory. Tuning to specific self-motion states was observed and exhibited distinct cortical depth-invariant coding properties. These patterns of collective local and laminar activation during behavior were reactivated in compressed form during post-experience sleep and temporally coupled to cortical delta waves and hippocampal sharp-wave ripples. Thus, PC neuron motion encoding is consistent across cortical laminae, and this consistency is maintained during memory reactivation."

However, its specific functions within distinct immune cell types have not been delineated in conditional KO mouse models. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-155 specifically within T cells during the immune response to syngeneic tumors. We found that miR-155 expression within T cells is required to limit syngeneic tumor growth and promote IFNγ production by T cells within the tumor microenvironment. Consequently, we found that miR-155 expression by T cells is necessary for proper tumor-associated macrophage expression of IFNγ-inducible genes. We also found that immune checkpoint–blocking (ICB) antibodies against programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) restored antitumor immunity in miR-155 T cell–conditional KO mice. We noted that these ICB antibodies rescued the levels of IFNγ-expressing T cells, expression of multiple activation and effector genes expressed by tumor-infiltrating CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, and tumor-associated macrophage activation. Moreover, the ICB approach partially restored expression of several derepressed miR-155 targets in tumor-infiltrating, miR-155–deficient CD8+ T cells, suggesting that miR-155 and ICB regulate overlapping pathways to promote antitumor immunity. Taken together, our findings highlight the multifaceted role of miR-155 in T cells, in which it promotes antitumor immunity. These results suggest that the augmentation of miR-155 expression could be used to improve anticancer immunotherapies. MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) regulates antitumor immune responses.

https://openalex.org/W2755381547,"Alternative polyadenylation (APA) is increasingly recognized to regulate gene expression across different cell types, but obtaining APA maps from individual cell types typically requires prior purification, a stressful procedure that can itself alter cellular states. Here, we describe a new platform, cTag-PAPERCLIP, that generates APA profiles from single cell populations in intact tissues; cTag-PAPERCLIP requires no tissue dissociation and preserves transcripts in native states. Applying cTag-PAPERCLIP to profile four major cell types in the mouse brain revealed common APA preferences between excitatory and inhibitory neurons distinct from astrocytes and microglia, regulated in part by neuron-specific RNA-binding proteins NOVA2 and PTBP2. We further identified a role of APA in switching Araf protein isoforms during microglia activation, impacting production of downstream inflammatory cytokines. Our results demonstrate the broad applicability of cTag-PAPERCLIP and a previously undiscovered role of APA in contributing to protein diversity between different cell types and cellular states within the brain."

https://openalex.org/W2754508573,"The neuroligin (Nlg) family of neural cell adhesion molecules is thought to be required for synapse formation and development and has been linked to the development of autism spectrum disorders in humans. In Drosophila melanogaster, mutations in the neuroligin 1–3 genes have been reported to induce synapse developmental defects at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), but the role of neuroligin 4 (dnlg4) in synapse development has not been determined. Here, we report that the Drosophila neuroligin 4 (DNlg4) is different from DNlg1–3 in that it presynaptically regulates NMJ synapse development. Loss of dnlg4 results in reduced growth of NMJs with fewer synaptic boutons. The morphological defects caused by dnlg4 mutant are associated with a corresponding decrease in synaptic transmission efficacy. All of these defects could only be rescued when DNlg4 was expressed in the presynapse of NMJs. To understand the basis of DNlg4 function, we looked for genetic interactions and found connections with the components of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway. Immunostaining and Western blot analyses demonstrated that the regulation of NMJ growth by DNlg4 was due to the positive modulation of BMP signaling by DNlg4. Specifically, BMP type I receptor thickvein (Tkv) abundance was reduced in dnlg4 mutants, and immunoprecipitation assays showed that DNlg4 and Tkv physically interacted in vivo. Our study demonstrates that DNlg4 presynaptically regulates neuromuscular synaptic growth via the BMP signaling pathway by modulating Tkv."

In a prospective, randomized trial, 36 male CD-1 mice, 4–6 weeks of age were randomly assigned to 5 groups: saline (SA, n = 4); ketamine-xylazine (KX, n = 8); ketamine-xylazine-lidocaine 4 mg/kg (KXL4, n = 8); ketamine-xylazine-lidocaine 8 mg/kg (KXL8, n = 8); ketamine-xylazine-lidocaine 16 mg/kg (KXL16, n = 8). Two mice in each group were euthanized at day 2 post-injection and the remaining mice were euthanized at day 11 post-injection. After IP injection, LRR and RRR, duration of immobilization and loss of PWR, body weight and histopathology were evaluated. LRR occurred sooner in mice receiving KXL16 compared with KX, with median (range) times of 78 (62–104) and 107 (91–298) seconds, respectively. Loss of PWR occurred in 1, 5, 4, 6 mice for groups KX, KXL4, KXL8, and KXL16 respectively. Median (range) duration of absent PWR was longer in mice receiving KXL16 at 13 (0–30) minutes, compared to KX at 0 (0–9) minutes. Duration of immobilization and RRR were not different between groups. Weight loss occurred 2 days following anesthesia but was not different between groups. Weight gain was significantly greater in all lidocaine groups 11 days post-injection compared to KX. No mortality or histopathologic abnormalities were observed in any group.

We previously identified a HOXB7 transcript that is one of a number of transcripts that are preferentially translated in membrane protrusions in pancreatic cancer cells. Immunocytochemistry showed that HOXB7 was localized to the cell protrusions of migrating pancreatic cancer cells. Knockdown of HOXB7 by transfection with HOXB7-specific siRNA decreased these protrusions and inhibited the motility and invasiveness of the cells. Transfection of a HOXB7-rescue construct into the HOXB7-knockdown cells restored peripheral actin structures in cell protrusions and abrogated the HOXB7 knockdown–induced decrease in cell protrusions. It is generally accepted that the Rho family of GTPases regulate the organization of actin filaments and contribute to the formation of cell protrusions. The levels of the active Rho GTPases were not influenced by HOXB7 in the cells; however, HOXB7 knockdown decreased the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2.

Unexpectedly, the GARP KO mice died within 24 h after birth and exhibited defective palatogenesis without apparent abnormalities in other major organs. Furthermore, we observed decreased apoptosis and SMAD2 phosphorylation in the medial edge epithelial cells of the palatal shelf of GARP KO embryos at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5), indicating a defect in the TGFβ signaling pathway in the GARP-null developing palates. Of note, the failure to develop the secondary palate and concurrent reduction of SMAD phosphorylation without other defects in GARP KO mice phenocopied TGFβ3 KO mice, although GARP has not been suggested previously to interact with TGFβ3.

https://openalex.org/W2754908810,"Understanding the mechanisms that link prey availability to predator behaviour and population change is central to projecting how a species may respond to future environmental pressures. We documented the behavioural responses and breeding investment of macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus across five breeding seasons where local prey density changed by five-fold; from very low to highly abundant. When prey availability was low, foraging trips were significantly longer and extended overnight. Birds also foraged farther from the colony, potentially in order to reach more distant foraging grounds and allow for increased search times. These extended foraging trips were also linked to a marked decrease in fledgling weights, most likely associated with reduced rates of provisioning. Furthermore, by comparing our results with previous work on this population, it appears that lowered first-year survival rates associated, at least partially, with fledging masses were also evident for this cohort. This study integrates a unique set of prey density, predator behaviour and predator breeding investment data to highlight a possible behavioural mechanism linking perturbations in prey availability to population demography."
https://openalex.org/W2756102938,"In humans, there is evidence that sensory processing of novel or threatening stimuli is right hemisphere dominated, especially in people experiencing negative affective states. There is also evidence for similar lateralization in a number of non-human animal species. Here we investigate whether this is also the case in domestic cattle that may experience long-term negative states due to commonly occurring conditions such as lameness. Health and welfare implications associated with pain in lame cows are a major concern in dairy farming. Behavioural tests combining animal behaviour and cognition could make a meaningful contribution to our understanding of disease-related changes in sensory processing in animals, and consequently enhance their welfare. We presented 216 lactating Holstein-Friesian cows with three different unfamiliar objects which were placed either bilaterally (e.g. two yellow party balloons, two black/white checkerboards) or hung centrally (a Kong™) within a familiar area. Cows were individually exposed to the objects on three consecutive days, and their viewing preference/eye use, exploration behaviour/nostril use, and stop position during approach was assessed. Mobility (lameness) was repeatedly scored during the testing period. Overall, a bias to view the right rather than the left object was found at initial presentation of the bilateral objects. More cows also explored the right object rather than the left object with their nose. There was a trend for cows appearing hesitant in approaching the objects by stopping at a distance to them, to then explore the left object rather than the right. In contrast, cows that approached the objects directly had a greater tendency to contact the right object. No significant preference in right or left eye/nostril use was found when cows explored the centrally-located object. We found no relationship between lameness and lateralized behaviour. Nevertheless, observed trends suggesting that lateralized behaviour in response to bilaterally located unfamiliar objects may reflect an immediate affective response are discussed. Further study is needed to understand the impact of long-term affective states on hemispheric dominance and lateralized behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2755626861,"In a joint go/no-go Simon task, each of two participants is to respond to one of two non-spatial stimulus features by means of a spatially lateralized response. Stimulus position varies horizontally and responses are faster and more accurate when response side and stimulus position match (compatible trial) than when they mismatch (incompatible trial), defining the social Simon effect or joint spatial compatibility effect. This effect was originally explained in terms of action/task co-representation, assuming that the co-actor’s action is automatically co-represented. Recent research by Dolk, Hommel, Prinz, and Liepelt (2013) challenged this account by demonstrating joint spatial compatibility effects in a task-setting in which non-social objects like a Japanese waving cat were present, but no real co-actor. They postulated that every sufficiently salient object induces joint spatial compatibility effects. However, what makes an object sufficiently salient is so far not well defined. To scrutinize this open question, the current study manipulated auditory and/or visual attention-attracting cues of a Japanese waving cat within an auditory (Experiment 1) and a visual joint go/no-go Simon task (Experiment 2). Results revealed that joint spatial compatibility effects only occurred in an auditory Simon task when the cat provided auditory cues while no joint spatial compatibility effects were found in a visual Simon task. This demonstrates that it is not the sufficiently salient object alone that leads to joint spatial compatibility effects but instead, a complex interaction between features of the object and the stimulus material of the joint go/no-go Simon task."

In this study, we aimed to determine whether the baseline serum cystatin C level represented one mechanism underlying WMH progression, and whether it was associated with the long-term progression of cerebral WMH volume in MRI. 166 consecutive individuals who were ≥50 years of age and who underwent initial/follow-up MRI evaluations within an interval of 34-45 months were included. Serum cystatin C level, glomerular-filtration rate (GFR), and other laboratory parameters were measured at their initial evaluation and at the end of follow-up. Cerebrovascular risk factors, medications, and blood-pressure parameters were also reviewed. WMH progression rate was measured by subtracting WMH volume at baseline from that at the follow-up using volumetric analysis, divided by the MRI intervals. At baseline, WMH volume was 9.61±13.17 mL, mean GFR was 77.3±22.8 mL/min, and mean cystatin C level was 0.92±0.52 mg/L. After 37.9±3.4 months, the change in WMH volume was 3.64±6.85 mL, the progression rate of WMH volume was 1.18±2.28 mL/year, the mean ΔGFR was 2.4±7.9 mL/min, and the mean Δcystatin C was 0.03±0.34 mg/L. The progression rate of WMH volume was linearly associated with cystatin C level (B coefficient = 0.856; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.174-1.538; P = 0.014), along with the baseline WMH volume (B = 0.039; 95% CI 0.019-0.059; P<0.001), after adjusting for the conventional vascular risk factors, laboratory parameters, medication profiles, and GFR. Especially, patients with a baseline level of cystatin C ≥1.00 mg/L exhibited a much higher progression rate of WMH as compared with those with a baseline level of cystatin C <1.00 mg/L (1.60±1.91 mL/year vs. 0.82±1.63 mL/year, P = 0.010). We concluded that serum cystatin C level is independently associated with the long-term progression rate of the cerebral WMH volume. Therefore, serum cystatin C level might predict the progression of cerebral WMH."
https://openalex.org/W2754353766,"Self-replicating ‘proteinaceous infectious particles’ or prions are responsible for complex heritable traits in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our current understanding of the biology of yeast prions stems from studies mostly done in the context of actively dividing cells in optimal laboratory growth conditions. Evidence suggest that fungal prions exist in the wild where most cells are in a non-dividing quiescent state, because of imperfect growth conditions, scarcity of nutrients and competition. We know little about the faithful transmission of yeast prions in such conditions and their physiological consequences throughout the lifespan of yeast cells. We addressed this issue for the [PSI+] prion that results from the self-assembly of the translation release factor Sup35p into insoluble fibrillar aggregates. [PSI+] leads to increased nonsense suppression and confers phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental fluctuations. Here, we report that while [PSI+] had little to no effect on growth per se, it dramatically improved the survival of yeast cells in stationary phase. Remarkably, prolonged chronological lifespan persisted even after [PSI+] was cured from the cells, suggesting that prions may facilitate the acquisition of complex new traits. Such an important selective advantage may contribute to the evolutionary conservation of the prion-forming ability of Sup35p orthologues in distantly related yeast species."

We obtained 99,087,448, 89,086,478, and 100,117,958 raw sequence reads from control 1, control 2, and control 3 groups, and 92,094,972, 92,883,894, and 92,500,828 raw sequence reads from test 1, test 2, and test 3 groups, respectively. After filtering and quality checking of the raw sequence reads, our analysis yielded 79,228,354, 72,336,470, 81,859,826, 77,649,400, 77,194,276, and 75,697,016 clean reads with a mean length of 150 bp from the control and test groups. After deltamethrin treatment, a total of 160 and 167 genes were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Gene ontology terms ""biological process,"" ""cellular component,"" and ""molecular function"" were enriched with respect to cell killing, cellular process, other organism part, cell part, binding, and catalytic. Pathway analysis using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes showed that the metabolic pathways were significantly enriched. We found that the CYP450 enzyme system, carboxylesterase, glutathione-S-transferase, and material (including carbohydrate, lipid, protein, and other substances) metabolism played important roles in the metabolism of deltamethrin in the hepatopancreas of E. sinensis.

Despite their important roles in ecosystems, the molecular basis of how diatoms cope with oxidative stress caused by nutrient fluctuations remains largely unknown. Here, an isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) proteomic method was coupled with a series of physiological and biochemical techniques to explore oxidative stress- and cell fate decision-related cellular and metabolic responses of the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana to nitrate (N) and inorganic phosphate (P) stresses. A total of 1151 proteins were detected; 122 and 56 were significantly differentially expressed from control under N- and P-limited conditions, respectively. In N-limited cells, responsive proteins were related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, oxidative stress responses and cell death, corresponding to a significant decrease in photosynthetic efficiency, marked intracellular ROS accumulation, and caspase-mediated programmed cell death activation. None of these responses were identified in P-limited cells; however, a significant up-regulation of alkaline phosphatase proteins was observed, which could be the major contributor for P-limited cells to cope with ambient P deficiency. These findings demonstrate that fundamentally different metabolic responses and cellular regulations are employed by the diatom in response to different nutrient stresses and to keep the cells viable."

https://openalex.org/W2756064388,"Tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) is involved in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, a disease where disturbances in the endocannabinoid system are seen. In the present study we have investigated whether treatment of DU145 human prostate cancer cells affects anandamide (AEA) catabolic pathways. Additionally, we have investigated whether cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) can regulate the uptake of AEA into cells. Levels of AEA synthetic and catabolic enzymes were determined by qPCR. AEA uptake and hydrolysis in DU145 and RAW264.7 macrophage cells were assayed using AEA labeled in the arachidonic and ethanolamine portions of the molecule, respectively. Levels of AEA, related N-acylethanolamines (NAEs), prostaglandins (PG) and PG-ethanolamines (PG-EA) in DU145 cells and medium were quantitated by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) analysis. TNFα treatment of DU145 cells increased mRNA levels of PTSG2 (gene of COX-2) and decreased the mRNA of the AEA synthetic enzyme N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine selective phospholipase D. mRNA levels of the AEA hydrolytic enzymes fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and N-acylethanolamine-hydrolyzing acid amidase were not changed. AEA uptake in both DU145 and RAW264.7 cells was inhibited by FAAH inhibition, but not by COX-2 inhibition, even in RAW264.7 cells where the expression of this enzyme had greatly been induced by lipopolysaccharide + interferon γ treatment. AEA and related NAEs were detected in DU145 cells, but PGs and PGE2-EA were only detected when the cells had been preincubated with 100 nM AEA. The data demonstrate that in DU145 cells, TNFα treatment changes the relative expression of the enzymes involved in the hydrolytic and oxygenation catabolic pathways for AEA. In RAW264.7 cells, COX-2, in contrast to FAAH, does not regulate the cellular accumulation of AEA.

https://openalex.org/W2755722206,"The sensory and physiological inputs which govern the larval-pupal transition in Drosophila, and the neuronal circuity that integrates them, are complex. Previous work from our laboratory identified a dosage-sensitive genetic interaction between the genes encoding the Rho-GEF Trio and the zinc-finger transcription factor Sequoia that interfered with the larval-pupal transition. Specifically, we reported heterozygous mutations in sequoia (seq) dominantly exacerbated the trio mutant phenotype, and this seq-enhanced trio mutant genotype blocked the transition of third instar larvae from foragers to wanderers, a requisite behavioral transition prior to pupation. In this work, we use the GAL4-UAS system to rescue this phenotype by tissue-specific trio expression. We find that expressing trio in the class IV dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons rescues the larval-pupal transition, demonstrating the reliance of the larval-pupal transition on the integrity of these sensory neurons. As nociceptive responses also rely on the functionality of the class IV da neurons, we test mechanical nociceptive responses in our mutant and rescued larvae and find that mechanical nociception is separable from the ability to undergo the larval-pupal transition. This demonstrates for the first time that the roles of the class IV da neurons in governing two critical larval behaviors, the larval-pupal transition and mechanical nociception, are functionally separable from each other."

Imagine you are walking down the street looking for lunch. Spotting a place across the road, you prepare to turn but, at the last moment, see a friend and instead keep walking to meet them. Though you never actually followed through with the turn, the fact is your brain still generated a measurable plan in preparation for doing so. Fleeting though they may be, movement intentions emerge through interactions across a network of cortical regions extending well beyond the motor areas that drive your legs to walk. We owe much of our knowledge of movement planning to decades of work in cortical neurophysiology, primarily in awake, behaving monkeys performing tasks while seated in a recording chair. Such experiments established that spatially targeted movements of the hand or eye, for example, are preceded by signals from a list of cortical regions that often begins at the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) (Andersen and Buneo, 2002Andersen R.A. Buneo C.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 189-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). In addition to sensorimotor functions, more recent work pointed toward a navigational role for PPC in monkeys, showing that neurons there encoded route segments in virtual reality houses and that inactivating PPC caused the monkeys to lose their way (Sato et al., 2006Sato N. Sakata H. Tanaka Y.L. Taira M. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 17001-17006Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recordings in rodents in the 80s and 90s also suggested a role for PPC in navigation (McNaughton et al., 1994McNaughton B.L. Mizumori S.J. Barnes C.A. Leonard B.J. Marquis M. Green E.J. Cereb. Cortex. 1994; 4: 27-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Here it was found that a substantial fraction of PPC cells (30%–50%) encoded basic modes of movement, such as turning, running, or combinations of movements, while freely-behaving subjects traversed an 8-arm radial maze. Unlike simple motor responses, neural firing in PPC was gated by the animals’ position in the maze when a movement was made (firing only at the end of a maze arm, for example). The PPC neurons thus signaled conjunctions of movement and spatial context, and subsequent work showed that this type of coding provided a scalable, route-centered metric for tracking an animal’s progress along irregular paths (Nitz, 2006Nitz D.A. Neuron. 2006; 49: 747-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Regardless of the species involved, one feature that links many studies in behavioral electrophysiology is the use of individual cells as the basic unit of neural computation, and physiologists typically go to lengths to ensure that their signals come from well-isolated cells. But the study by Wilber et al., 2017Wilber A.A. Skelin I. Wu W. McNaughton B.L. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 1406-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, on the other hand, specifically examined the collective background chatter from thousands of PPC cells, either in the form of multi-unit activity (MUA) or high-frequency filtered local field potentials (HF-LFPs), while rats ran across an open arena to reach cued or remembered reward locations (Figure 1). Surprisingly, Wilber et al., 2017Wilber A.A. Skelin I. Wu W. McNaughton B.L. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 1406-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar found that self-motion representations—the kind typically recorded from single PPC neurons—were expressed stably in the sea of cortical activity. Moreover, the movement correlates of the MUA/HF-LFP could differ sharply from one recording site to the next, yet at a given site the tuning was conserved across cortical layers. It is exactly what one would expect to see if PPC contained cortical columns. Even more interesting was the fact that the putative cortical modules replayed MUA sequences during post-task sleep sessions (Figure 1), suggesting a previously unconsidered role for PPC in storing memories of the movements the animals made. Wilber et al., 2017Wilber A.A. Skelin I. Wu W. McNaughton B.L. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 1406-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar’s analysis of broader-bandwidth neural activity thus uncovered fascinating evidence that self-motion representations in the rat PPC are organized in modular patches at a larger anatomical scale than previously known. An arguably comparable revelation occurred in the mouse visual system 10 years ago, when it was found that the secondary visual cortex, once considered homogeneous, actually consisted of a cluster of anatomically distinct subareas surrounding V1 (Wang and Burkhalter, 2007Wang Q. Burkhalter A. J. Comp. Neurol. 2007; 502: 339-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). But as with any new insight in science, the new findings raise new questions. For example, how is it that a uniform correlate for a single type of locomotor behavior emerges from thousands of individual cells with different tuning properties? Unlike orientation columns in visual cortex or grid modules in entorhinal cortex, there is little evidence of fine-scale functional clustering in the rodent PPC. Rather, neurons that prefer left turns comingle with cells that prefer forward running, and these are all comingled with neurons that have nothing to do with movement whatsoever (Whitlock et al., 2012Whitlock J.R. Pfuhl G. Dagslott N. Moser M.-B. Moser E.I. Neuron. 2012; 73: 789-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Wilber et al., 2017Wilber A.A. Skelin I. Wu W. McNaughton B.L. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 1406-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar propose that the partial overlap of firing fields from thousands of individual cells could lead to the emergence of a single, overarching movement correlate. If this is the case, it would not be the first time that a coarse remnant of single-cell tuning was reported at the macroscale. One cannot help but to think of the hexagonally symmetric directional tuning observed in the human entorhinal cortex during virtual navigation and its possible connection with the hexagonal firing pattern of single grid cells (Doeller et al., 2010Doeller C.F. Barry C. Burgess N. Nature. 2010; 463: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Though it is unlikely that such macroscopic phenomena result directly from the tuning of single cells, they can nevertheless provide clues regarding organizational principles of neural coding at larger anatomical levels. Another question is whether the movement correlates expressed by the putative modules are specific to the task used in the study. For context, previous work has shown that the movement correlates of individual PPC cells change completely across different navigational routes (Nitz, 2006Nitz D.A. Neuron. 2006; 49: 747-756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and different behavioral tasks (Whitlock et al., 2012Whitlock J.R. Pfuhl G. Dagslott N. Moser M.-B. Moser E.I. Neuron. 2012; 73: 789-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This naturally raises the question of whether coding properties at the mesoscale would change across different behavioral paradigms. Testing this idea could prove intriguing, since the results would suggest whether tuning expressed at larger scales in PPC is functional in nature (i.e., task dependent) or biologically hardwired via genetics or anatomical connections. On a related note, it is entirely possible that the modules described by Wilber et al., 2017Wilber A.A. Skelin I. Wu W. McNaughton B.L. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 1406-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar overlap anatomically with some of the higher-order visual areas described by Wang and Burkhalter, 2007Wang Q. Burkhalter A. J. Comp. Neurol. 2007; 502: 339-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, and it would indeed be fascinating to see whether patches with different movement preferences also exhibited distinct retinotopic maps for visual stimuli. If this were true, the findings could begin to reveal an even bigger picture of how sensorimotor transformations are organized in PPC and surrounding areas. In any case, the existence of modular tuning in the rat PPC fits well with the notion that PPC in monkeys, and likely humans, is parcellated into specialized sub-regions. Previously, the primate PPC was conceptualized as forming an “intentional map” made of distinct subareas for planning movements of the eye, arm, or hand (Andersen and Buneo, 2002Andersen R.A. Buneo C.A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 25: 189-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). Systematic electrophysiological mapping has also shown the existence of graded topographies along the surface of the inferior parietal lobe in monkeys (Rozzi et al., 2008Rozzi S. Ferrari P.F. Bonini L. Rizzolatti G. Fogassi L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1569-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Specifically, a somatotopic organization was found for various motor responses, with movements of the mouth being most rostral, movements of the hand next, and arm movements most caudal. In light of these observations, one cannot help but wonder whether movement representations in the rodent PPC are also arranged according to an underlying somatotopic or behaviorally-relevant organization. Addressing this question in rodents, however, would first require either a substantial upgrade in the detail of behavioral monitoring or the use of simplistic tasks during head fixation to isolate movements of the paw, face, whiskers, and mouth. Another provocative finding from the Wilber et al., 2017Wilber A.A. Skelin I. Wu W. McNaughton B.L. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 1406-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar study is that the activity patterns recorded across multiple tetrodes during task performance were replayed during subsequent sleep sessions (Figure 1), implicating PPC as a possible actor in memory consolidation. This is a surprising finding since the rodent PPC has rather weak connectivity with the hippocampal formation, where replay is most prevalent. Yet, the post-task activity patterns in PPC exhibited several hallmarks of memory-related replay described originally in the hippocampus (Wilson and McNaughton, 1994Wilson M.A. McNaughton B.L. Science. 1994; 265: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar), including the dependence on prior experience and the occurrence at compressed timescales. In some instances, the replayed activity maintained the same sequential ordering across tetrodes as seen during the trajectory-running task, demonstrating that the internally generated activity patterns were organized across several hundred microns or more. In this sense, Wilber et al., 2017Wilber A.A. Skelin I. Wu W. McNaughton B.L. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 1406-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar are the first to provide evidence of offline cell assembly activity in PPC, and the manner in which it was detected suggests that it happens across relatively large scales. It remains to be seen whether reactivation in PPC during sleep plays a causal role in storing route information, for example, to a newfound food source, but closed-loop inactivation during hippocampal sharp waves or other approaches could be used to test this idea. For now, it seems that a phenomenon whose primary domain was once thought to be the limbic system occurs outside of it as well, hinting at the possibility that replay could happen throughout the neocortex. On the whole, the approach of sampling large-scale neuronal activity by Wilber et al., 2017Wilber A.A. Skelin I. Wu W. McNaughton B.L. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 1406-1419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar has given us a wider window through which to view the function and organization of neural representations in the rat PPC. By examining signals recorded from larger volumes of cortex, this study steps into a middle ground between single-unit electrophysiology in animal models and functional imaging in humans. The intermediate recording scale used here could help identify emergent patterns in the way signals are computed and transmitted across cortex and can only help to bridge the gap between the very different datasets yielded in animal models versus humans. In an age where mesoscopic sampling of neural activity is accomplished more frequently, there is good hope that we will continue to uncover emergent patterns in information processing which were in front of us all along, though on a scale too large to see.

Alternative polyadenylation often regulates mRNA isoform usage. In this issue of Neuron, Hwang et al., 2017Hwang H.W. Saito Y. Park C.Y. Blachère N.E. Tajima Y. Fak J.J. Zucker-Scharff I.

The production of mature mRNA species involves several processing steps, including the linked endonucleolytic cleavage and polyadenylation of a nascent transcript. Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) is a phenomenon in which alternate polyadenylation sites are targeted in order to generate different mRNA isoforms from the same gene (Figure 1A). As this usage of distinct polyadenylation sites within a nascent transcript can lead to alterations in exon incorporation, mRNA stability, and mRNA localization, APA is an essential and broadly conserved process that can influence the encoded protein’s sequence, levels, and localization (Tian and Manley, 2017Tian B. Manley J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 18-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Several global transcriptomic studies have found that APA is a highly dynamic process that differs across cell types and developmental stages, for example, with rapidly proliferating cells having the shortest 3′ UTRs and differentiated cells, including neurons, possessing longer 3′ UTRs at a genome-wide level (Miura et al., 2013Miura P. Shenker S. Andreu-Agullo C. Westholm J.O. Lai E.C. Genome Res. 2013; 23: 812-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In neurons, APA has been linked to several mRNA isoform properties, including localization (Taliaferro et al., 2016Taliaferro J.M. Vidaki M. Oliveira R. Olson S. Zhan L. Saxena T. Wang E.T. Graveley B.R. Gertler F.B. Swanson M.S. Burge C.B. Mol. Cell. 2016; 61: 821-833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and encoded protein sequence alterations (Flavell et al., 2008Flavell S.W. Kim T.-K. Gray J.M. Harmin D.A. Hemberg M. Hong E.J. Markenscoff-Papadimitriou E. Bear D.M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 2008; 60: 1022-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). These studies have shown that cell-type-specific data are essential to not only accurately profile APA, but also to understand its significance and gain mechanistic insights into its regulation. Thus, in order to study the role of APA in each developmental context and cell type, a methodology has been needed that can faithfully report cell-type-specific APA in situ. In the central nervous system (CNS), this is a particularly daunting challenge given the heterogeneity of cell types. Hwang and colleagues recently developed a methodology that can be used to interrogate the 3′ ends of mRNAs called poly(A) binding protein (PABP)-mediated mRNA 3′ end retrieval by cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) (PAPERCLIP) (Hwang et al., 2016Hwang H.-W. Park C.Y. Goodarzi H. Fak J.J. Mele A. Moore M.J. Saito Y. Darnell R.B. Cell Rep. 2016; 15: 423-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PAPERCLIP uses the CLIP approach to target PABP and retrieve its associated mRNAs’ 3′ ends for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). This methodology allows unbiased, quantitative, nucleotide-level resolution of mRNA 3′ ends, since it eliminates artifacts due to the internal mRNA mispriming that are inherent in other 3′ UTR sequencing methodologies that rely on the use of reverse transcription with oligo(dT) primers. Using PAPERCLIP, Hwang et al., 2016Hwang H.-W. Park C.Y. Goodarzi H. Fak J.J. Mele A. Moore M.J. Saito Y. Darnell R.B. Cell Rep. 2016; 15: 423-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar not only detected APA shifts during mouse brain development, but also importantly showed that PAPERCLIP can be used to gain mechanistic insights into the regulation of APA. However, even though the PAPERCLIP methodology is ideal for high-performance identification of mRNA 3′ ends, and thus APA, the near-universal expression of PABP limits the resolution of PAPERCLIP data in tissues constituted of many heterogeneous cell types, such as in the CNS. In this issue of Neuron, Hwang et al., 2017Hwang H.W. Saito Y. Park C.Y. Blachère N.E. Tajima Y. Fak J.J. Zucker-Scharff I. Darnell R.B. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 1334-1349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar report a new version of the PAPERCLIP methodology that can be used in a cell-type-specific manner. For this purpose, they generated a knockin mouse line in which PABP is tagged with GFP in a conditional Cre-dependent fashion. This version of PAPERCLIP is called conditionally tagged poly(A) binding protein-mediated mRNA 3′ end retrieval by cross-linking immunoprecipitation (cTag-PAPERCLIP) (Figure 1B). The use of Cre-based conditional expression makes this approach highly selective and versatile, in theory allowing access to any genetically defined cell type. The fact that cTag-PAPERCLIP purifications can be performed from whole tissue is extremely important to obviate stress-induced effects (e.g., upon tissue dissociation and cell purification), which themselves have been well documented to lead to APA shifts. In this first application of cTag-PAPERCLIP, Hwang et al., 2017Hwang H.W. Saito Y. Park C.Y. Blachère N.E. Tajima Y. Fak J.J. Zucker-Scharff I. Darnell R.B.

Among all of the genes expressed across the four genetically defined cell types, about one-third displayed APA by cTag-PAPERCLIP analysis. And among these third, over two dozen showed marked differences in APA between neurons and glia. Studying how these differences may be regulated, Hwang et al., 2017Hwang H.W. Saito Y. Park C.Y.

In a final example of the power of cTag-PAPERCLIP to obviate stress-induced changes to APA profiles, Hwang et al., 2017Hwang H.W. Saito Y. Park C.Y. Blachère N.E. Tajima Y. Fak J.J. Zucker-Scharff I. Darnell R.B. Neuron. 2017; 95 (this issue): 1334-1349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar showed that cTag-PAPERCLIP can isolate microglial transcripts with minimal induction of microglial activation markers. This ability allowed them to discover a role for APA during microglial activation following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge, in which they observed not only biased usage of proximal APA sites, but also, as one example, a switch to full-length ARAF protein expression during microglial activation that they link to inflammatory cytokine production. Thus, Hwang et al., 2017Hwang H.W. Saito Y. Park C.Y. Blachère N.E. Tajima Y. Fak J.J. Zucker-Scharff I. Darnell R.B.

Application of new CLIP techniques (Van Nostrand et al., 2016Van Nostrand E.L. Pratt G.A. Shishkin A.A. Gelboin-Burkhart C. Fang M.Y. Sundararaman B. Blue S.M. Nguyen T.B. Surka C.

Schaefer A. Gong S. Peterson J.D. Day M. Ramsey K.E. Suárez-Fariñas M. Schwarz C. Stephan D.A.

Neuron. 2012; 73: 35-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) has great potential to reveal further mechanistic and functional insights regarding APA in neurons. Finally, as APA has been shown to be altered during several disease contexts, application of the cTag-PAPERCLIP methodology also has great potential to yield new insights into CNS disease biology. For example, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked pathophysiology has been associated with various aspects of RNA processing, and the ALS-linked proteins C9ORF72 and HNRNPA2B1 have both recently been suggested to affect APA. A more specific characterization of APA in ALS models using cTag-PAPERCLIP may yield new insights into the APA-linked consequences of ALS-linked mutations. The cTag-PAPERCLIP methodology shows great promise for leading the way to many novel insights into the phenomenology and mechanistic basis of APA in both normal and disease contexts. cTag-PAPERCLIP Reveals Alternative Polyadenylation Promotes Cell-Type Specific Protein Diversity and Shifts Araf Isoforms with Microglia ActivationHwang et al.NeuronSeptember 13, 2017In BriefHwang et al. develop cTag-PAPERCLIP to profile mRNA 3′ ends in individual cell types from intact tissues in vivo.

The president9s plea came on the heels of a gunman9s murder of 20 children and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in December, 2012. Nine months later, the huge biomedical research agency issued three notices encouraging scientists to apply to do research on violence and its prevention, particularly firearm research. NIH has since spent $18 million funding 22 projects. But the agency has now let the gun research program lapse, Science has learned. It stopped taking applications in January, despite a written plea from a score of scientists, and the last new awards are now being launched. Last week, an agency spokesperson said that renewal of the program is still under consideration, but gave no timeline for when the agency would reach a decision."

https://openalex.org/W2754561642,"The effect of S-substitution on the O6 guanine site of a 13-mer DNA duplex containing a G:T mismatch is studied using molecular dynamics. The structure, dynamic evolution and hydration of the S-substituted duplex are compared with those of a normal duplex, a duplex with S-substitution on guanine, but no mismatch and a duplex with just a G:T mismatch. The S-substituted mismatch leads to cell death rather than repair. One suggestion is that the G:T mismatch recognition protein recognises the S-substituted mismatch (GS:T) as G:T. This leads to a cycle of futile repair ending in DNA breakage and cell death. We find that some structural features of the helix are similar for the duplex with the G:T mismatch and that with the S-substituted mismatch, but differ from the normal duplex, notably the helical twist. These differences arise from the change in the hydrogen-bonding pattern of the base pair. However a marked feature of the S-substituted G:T mismatch duplex is a very large opening. This showed considerable variability. It is suggested that this enlarged opening would lend support to an alternative model of cell death in which the mismatch protein attaches to thioguanine and activates downstream damage-response pathways. Attack on the sulphur by reactive oxygen species, also leading to cell death, would also be aided by the large, variable opening."

https://openalex.org/W2756377339,"Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are important regulatory factors that modulate the chromatin state. They form protein complexes that repress gene expression by the introduction of posttranslational histone modifications. The study of PcG proteins divergence in Drosophila revealed signals of coevolution among them and an acceleration of the nonsynonymous evolutionary rate in the lineage ancestral to the obscura group species, mainly in subunits of the Pcl-PRC2 complex. Herein, we have studied the nucleotide polymorphism of PcG genes in a natural population of D. subobscura to detect whether natural selection has also modulated the evolution of these important regulatory genes in a more recent time scale. Results show that most genes are under the action of purifying selection and present a level and pattern of polymorphism consistent with predictions of the neutral model, the exceptions being Su(z)12 and Pho. MK tests indicate an accumulation of adaptive changes in the SU(Z)12 protein during the divergence of D. subobscura and D. guanche. In contrast, the HKA test shows a deficit of polymorphism at Pho. The most likely explanation for this reduced variation is the location of this gene in the dot-like chromosome and would indicate that this chromosome also has null or very low recombination in D. subobscura, as reported in D. melanogaster."
