https://openalex.org/W2010488494,"To investigate the possible role of ras proteins in the differentiation process signaled by nerve growth factor, we have microinjected the proto-oncogenic and oncogenic (T24) forms of the human H-ras protein into living rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12). PC12 cells, which have the phenotype of replicating chromaffin-like cells under normal growth conditions, respond to nerve growth factor by differentiating into nonreplicating sympathetic neuron-like cells. Microinjection of the ras oncogene protein promoted the morphological differentiation of PC12 cells into neuron-like cells. In contrast, microinjection of similar amounts of the proto-oncogene form of the ras protein had no apparent effect on PC12 cells. The induction of morphological differentiation by the ras oncogene protein occurred in the absence of nerve growth factor, was dependent on protein synthesis, and was accompanied by cessation of cell division. Treatment of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor or cAMP analogue prior to injection did not alter the phenotypic changes induced by the ras oncogene protein."

https://openalex.org/W1998164097,"The possibility that neuronal damage due to hypoglycemia is induced by agonists acting on the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor was investigated in the rat caudate nucleus. Local injections of an NMDA receptor antagonist, 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid, were performed before induction of 30 minutes of reversible, insulin-induced, hypoglycemic coma. Neuronal necrosis in these animals after 1 week of recovery was reduced 90 percent compared to that in saline-injected animals. The results suggest that hypoglycemic neuronal damage is induced by NMDA receptor agonists, such as the excitatory amino acids or related compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1994261379,"Two different experimental approaches have provided evidence that both U2 and U1 snRNPs function in pre-mRNA splicing. When the U2 snRNPs in a nuclear extract are selectively degraded using ribonuclease H and either of two deoxyoligonucleotides complementary to U2 RNA, splicing activity is abolished. Mixing an extract in which U2 has been degraded with one in which U1 has been degraded recovers activity. Use of anti-(U2)RNP autoantibodies demonstrates that U2 snRNPs associate with the precursor RNA during in vitro splicing. At 60 min, but not at 0 min, into the reaction intron fragments that include the branch-point sequence are immunoprecipitated by anti-(U2)RNP. At all times, U1 snRNPs bind the 5' splice site of the pre-mRNA. Possible interactions of the U2 snRNP with the U1 snRNP and with the pre-mRNA during splicing are considered."
https://openalex.org/W2048659444,"Complementary DNA (cDNA) clones encoding human macrophage-specific specific colony-stimulating factor (CSF-1) were isolated. One cDNA clone codes for a mature polypeptide of 224 amino acids and a putative leader of 32 amino acids. This cDNA, which was cloned in the Okayama-Berg expression vector, specifies the synthesis of biologically active CSF-1 in COS cells, as determined by a specific radioreceptor assay, macrophage bone marrow colony formation, and antibody neutralization. Most of the cDNA isolates contain part of an intron sequence that changes the reading frame, resulting in an abrupt termination of translation; these cDNA's were inactive in COS cells. The CSF-1 appears to be encoded by a single-copy gene, but its expression results in the synthesis of several messenger RNA species, ranging in size from about 1.5 to 4.5 kilobases."
https://openalex.org/W1985971484,"Latently infected B lymphocytes continuously express an Epstein-Barr Virus nuclear antigen (EBNA-1) required in trans for maintenance of the plasmid state of the EBV genome. Filter binding assays and DNAase I footprinting analyses revealed that the carboxy-terminal domain of EBNA-1 protects binding sites at three different loci in the 172,000 bp EBV genome. Two of these loci correspond to essential elements within an 1800 bp segment defined as the minimal region required for plasmid maintenance (ori-P). Binding to each of 20 X 30 bp tandem repeats in the ""sink"" locus protects 25 bp centered over a 12 bp palindromic consensus sequence TAGCATATGCTA. The nearby dyad symmetry ""origin"" locus contains two 46 bp protected regions each encompassing two paired core binding sites. The demonstration of sequence-specific binding at multiple loci suggests that EBNA-1 has pleiotropic functions, which may include control of copy number and segregation of the EBV plasmids as well as initiation of replication."
https://openalex.org/W2091031681,We describe a model system for study of chromatin structure at levels above that of the nucleosome. A series of fragments with lengths ranging from 172 to 207 bp tandemly repeated three to greater than 50 times was prepared; each repeat contains the region important in forming a positioned core particle on a sea urchin 5S rRNA gene upon in vitro association with histones. The tandemly repeated sequences can be studied as linear DNA fragments or as relaxed or supercoiled circular molecules. A number of criteria indicate that nucleosomes position correctly on all the tandemly repeated elements. Measurement of the change in linking number per core particle led to a value of -1.0. Both length and repeat number dependent changes in conformation of the nucleoproteins are observed. We discuss the possibility that some ordered higher level chromatin structure can form with DNA and core histones alone.
https://openalex.org/W2122071753,"We have identified six distinct factors necessary for pre-mRNA splicing in vitro by selective inactivation and complementation studies, and by fractionation procedures. Splicing factor 1 (SF1) is sensitive to micrococcal nuclease, and appears to consist of at least U1 and U2 snRNPs, since splicing is inhibited when the 5' termini of U1 and U2 snRNAs are removed by site-directed cleavage with RNAase H. SF2 is a micrococcal nuclease-resistant factor present in the nuclear extract but absent from an S100 extract. SF3 is a factor that can be preferentially inactivated by moderate heat treatment. Two additional factors (SF4A and SF4B) were identified by fractionation of the nuclear extract using spermine-agarose and CM-sepharose chromatography. SF1, SF2, and SF4B appear to be required for cleavage of the pre-mRNA at the 5' splice site and lariat formation, whereas SF3 and SF4A are only required for cleavage at the 3' splice site and exon ligation."
https://openalex.org/W1971951822,"The retroviral transmembrane envelope protein p15E is immunosuppressive in that it inhibits immune responses of lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages. A region of p15E has been conserved among murine and feline retroviruses; a homologous region is also found in the transmembrane envelope proteins of the human retroviruses HTLV-I and HTLV-II and in a putative envelope protein encoded by an endogenous C-type human retroviral DNA. A peptide (CKS-17) was synthesized to correspond to this region of homology and was examined for its effects on lymphocyte proliferation. CKS-17 inhibited the proliferation of an interleukin-2-dependent murine cytotoxic T-cell line as well as alloantigen-stimulated proliferation of murine and human lymphocytes. Four other peptides, representing different regions of virus proteins, were inactive. These results suggest that the immunosuppressive portion of retroviral transmembrane envelope proteins may reside, at least in part, in a-conserved sequence represented by the CKS-17 peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1985375619,"The 21-base pair repeat elements of the SV40 promoter contain six tandem copies of the GGGCGG hexanucleotide (GC-box), each of which can bind, with varying affinity, to the cellular transcription factor, Sp1. In vitro SV40 early RNA synthesis is mediated by interaction of Sp1 with GC-boxes I, II, and III, whereas transcription in the late direction is mediated by binding to GC-boxes III, V, and VI."
https://openalex.org/W1485049172,"Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) elicits the production of superoxide (O2-) by a cell-free system represented by sonically disrupted guinea pig peritoneal macrophages. O2- generation requires NADPH and a heat-sensitive cellular component, is proportional to the amount of macrophage protein, and exhibits a pH optimum of 6.5-7. The kinetic parameters of the SDS-stimulated enzyme are: Km (+/- S.E.) = 0.0367 +/- 0.003 mM NADPH and Vmax (+/- S.E.) = 73.46 +/- 9.09 nmol O2-/mg of protein/min. O2- production is dependent on the cooperation between a particulate subcellular component sedimentable at 48,000 X g and a cytosolic factor present in the 48,000 X g supernatant. The activity of both components is destroyed by heating at 80 degrees C. Pretreatment of intact macrophages with phorbol myristate acetate results in the partial removal of the requirement for cytosolic factor; SDS is now capable of activating the isolated 48,000 X g pellet. Among a large number of anionic, cationic, and nonionic detergents tested, only the anionic detergents SDS and sodium dodecyl sulfonate are capable of eliciting O2- production in the cell-free system, SDS being the more potent stimulant. It is proposed that the structural requirements that make these compounds capable of activating the O2- forming NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system are the presence of an anionic polar head and a long hydrophobic alkyl tail. We suggest that sodium salts of long chain unsaturated fatty acids that were found by us to be capable of stimulating O2- production in a cell-free system (Bromberg, Y., and Pick, E. (1984) Cell. Immunol. 88, 213-221) owe their activity to the fact that they function as anionic detergents."
https://openalex.org/W1967186843,"The ftsZ gene in E. coli K-12 is an essential cell division gene. We report that a two to sevenfold increase in the level of the FtsZ protein resulted in induction of the minicell phenotype. An increase in the level of FtsZ beyond this range resulted in an inhibition of all cell division. Unlike the classical minicell mutant, the formation of minicells induced by increased levels of FtsZ did not occur at the expense of normal divisions, indicating that increasing FtsZ resulted in additional division events per cell cycle. In addition, increased FtsZ caused cell division to be initiated earlier in the cell cycle. These results are consistent with the level or activity of FtsZ controlling the frequency of cell division in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2015553561,"A new method has been devised to measure the number of base pairs per helical turn along any DNA molecule in solution. A DNA restriction fragment is adsorbed onto crystalline calcium phosphate, fragmented by reaction with iron(II) EDTA, and subjected to electrophoresis on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. A modulated cutting pattern results, which gives directly the helical periodicity of the DNA molecule. A 150-base pair sequence directly upstream of the thymidine kinase gene of the type 1 herpes simplex virus was found to have an overall helical twist of 10.5 base pairs per turn, which is characteristic of the B conformation of DNA. In addition, purines 3' to pyrimidines showed lower than expected reactivity toward the iron cutting reagent, which is evidence for sequence-dependent variability in DNA conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2033599095,"The transforming protein of Rous sarcoma virus (pp60v-src) and its normal cellular homolog (pp60c-src) are demonstrated to be phosphorylated at serine 12 in vivo under certain conditions. We propose that protein kinase C is responsible for this modification based on the following evidence. First, the tumor promoters, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and teleocidin, and synthetic diacylglycerol, known activators of protein kinase C in vivo, cause nearly complete phosphorylation of pp60src at serine 12. Second, among five purified serine/threonine-specific protein kinases tested, only protein kinase C phosphorylates pp60c-src and pp60v-src in vitro at serine 12. Third, purified protein kinase C phosphorylates a synthetic peptide corresponding to the N-terminal 20 amino acids of pp60c-src at serine 12. The physiological significance of this novel phosphorylation is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1970669146,"A direct selection procedure has been used to isolate 11 distinct yeast genomic DNA fragments that eliminate the extreme segregation bias characteristic of autonomously replicating yeast plasmids. The selection scheme takes advantage of the fact that the cloned ochre suppressing tRNA gene, SUP11, is lethal at high copy number and therefore causes cell death when present on an ARS plasmid that lacks a cis-acting partition function. Each of the cloned DNA sequences was mapped to specific yeast chromosomes by hybridization to chromosome-sized DNA molecules separated by alternating field electrophoresis. Ten of the cloned fragments correspond to chromosomal centromeres; one fragment corresponds to the cis-acting locus required for endogenous 2μ plasmid stability. Nucleotide sequence comparison of the ten centromere DNAs gives a new picture of conserved centromere DNA elements."
https://openalex.org/W2090290726,"The gene encoding the human interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor consists of 8 exons spanning more than 25 kilobases on chromosome 10. Exons 2 and 4 were derived from a gene duplication event and unexpectedly also are homologous to the recognition domain of human complement factor B. Alternative messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing may delete exon 4 sequences, resulting in a mRNA that does not encode a functional IL-2 receptor. Leukemic T cells infected with HTLV-I and normal activated T cells express IL-2 receptors with identical deduced protein sequences. Receptor gene transcription is initiated at two principal sites in normal activated T cells. Adult T cell leukemia cells infected with HTLV-I show activity at both of these sites, but also at a third transcription initiation site."

https://openalex.org/W2037468270,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV), a virus with known carcinogenic potential, integrates into cellular DNA during long-term persistent infection in man. Hepatocellular carcinomas isolated from viral carriers often contain clonally propagated viral DNA integrations. As small chromosomal deletions are associated with several types of carcinomas, the occurrence of chromosomal deletions in association with HBV integration in hepatocellular carcinoma was studied. HBV integration was accompanied by a deletion of at least 13.5 kilobases of cellular sequences in a human hepatocellular carcinoma. The viral DNA integration and deletion of cellular sequences occurred on the short arm of chromosome 11 at location 11p13-11p14. The cellular sequences that were deleted at the site of HBV integration were lost from the tumor cells, leaving only a single copy of the remaining cellular allele."
https://openalex.org/W2043366026,Tumors induced in chickens by Rous sarcoma virus remain localized at the site of injection even though the animals become viremic. Tumors have now been shown to be inducible at other sites if a wound is inflicted or if the tissue is injured by administration of tumor promoters. These findings indicate that local wounding plays a role in the spread of tumorigenicity of Rous sarcoma virus.
https://openalex.org/W2071532423,"We have examined the coding capability and expression of the Drosophila homolog of the vertebrate proto-oncogene c-src. Sequence analysis of a cDNA clone representing the Drosophila c-src locus suggests that the gene encodes a 62 kd protein that is remarkably similar to the protein product of chicken c-src. The Drosophila c-src locus is transcribed into three mRNAs that are each regulated independently during development. Drosophila c-src RNA is abundant in embryos and pupae but rare in larvae and adults. In situ hybridization reveals that after the first 8 hr of development, c-src RNA accumulates almost exclusively in neural tissues such as the brain, ventral nerve chord, and eye-antennal discs, and in differentiating smooth muscle. We conclude that c-src may not be a mitotic signal but instead may play a role in the development of neural tissue and smooth muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1551187478,"Purified human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) was iodinated to high specific activity with good retention of its biological activity, as determined by the cytotoxic titer on murine L929 cells. The binding of 125I-TNF to L929 and human HeLa S2 cells grown in monolayer was initially measured, but high levels of nonspecific binding were observed. Specific binding to high affinity receptors of HeLa S2 cells grown in suspension culture was demonstrated by competitive displacement experiments and analysis of the binding data with the LIGAND program. A KD of 2 X 10(-10) M and 6000 receptors/cell were calculated in this way. These observations provide the first direct evidence for a cellular receptor for TNF. The cell-bound 125I-TNF was internalized at 37 degrees C, presumably by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and subsequently degraded to acid-soluble products. Three lines of human lymphoblastoid cells were examined for sensitivity to the cytostatic effect of TNF and for the presence of high affinity receptors. Daudi and Raji cells were insensitive to TNF and showed very few specific binding sites when incubated with 125I-TNF. Jurkat cells were growth-inhibited by TNF and showed a significantly greater number of specific binding sites than the other lymphoblastoid cells. These findings suggest that the sensitivity of some cell lines to the biological effects of TNF may be correlated with the presence of a relatively high number of receptors for this factor."

https://openalex.org/W2076519092,"Synthesis of human light-strand mitochondrial DNA was accomplished in vitro using DNA primase, DNA polymerase, and other accessory proteins isolated from human mitochondria. Replication begins with the synthesis of primer RNA on a T-rich sequence in the origin stem-loop structure of the template DNA and absolutely requires ATP. A transition from RNA synthesis to DNA synthesis occurs near the base of the stem-loop structure and a potential recognition site for signaling that transition has been identified. The start sites of the in vitro products were mapped at the nucleotide level and were found to be in excellent agreement with those of in vivo nascent light-strand DNA. Isolated human mitochondrial enzymes recognize and utilize the bovine, but not the mouse, origin of light-strand replication."
https://openalex.org/W1501673075,"The potential for processive EcoRI endonuclease hydrolysis has been examined on several DNA substrates containing two EcoRI sites which were embedded in identical sequence environments. With a 388-base pair circular DNA, in which the two recognition sites are separated by 51 base pairs (shorter distance) or 337 base pairs (longer distance), 77 and 34% of all events involved processive hydrolysis at ionic strengths of 0.059 and 0.13, respectively. However, the frequency of processive action on linear substrates, in which the two sites were separated by 51 base pairs, was only 42 and 17% at these ionic strengths, values half those observed with the circular DNA. Processive action was not detectable on circular or linear substrates at an ionic strength of 0.23. These findings indicate that DNA search by the endonuclease occurs by facilitated diffusion, a mechanism in which the protein locates and leaves its recognition sequence by interacting with nonspecific DNA sites. We suggest that processivity on linear substrates is limited to values half that for small circles due to partitioning of the enzyme between the two products generated by cleavage of a linear molecule. Given such topological effects, measured processivity values imply that the endonuclease can diffuse within a DNA domain to locate and recognize an EcoRI site 50 to 300 base pairs distant from an initial binding site, with minimum search efficiencies being 80 and 30% at ionic strengths of 0.059 and 0.13, respectively. The high efficiency of processive action indicates that a positionally correlated mode of search plays a major role in facilitated diffusion in this system under such conditions. Also consistent with this view was the identification of a striking position effect when two closely spaced EcoRI sites were asymmetrically positioned near the end of a linear DNA. The endonuclease displays a substantial preference for the more centrally located recognition sequence. This preference does not reflect differential sensitivity of the two sites to cleavage per se, but can be simply explained by preferential entry of the enzyme via the larger nonspecific target available to the more centrally positioned recognition sequence. These conclusions differ from those of a previous qualitative analysis of endonuclease processivity over short distances (Langowski, J., Alves, J., Pingoud, A., and Maass, G. (1983) Nucleic Acids Res. 11, 501-513)."
https://openalex.org/W1529443613,"Cleavage of the polyphosphoinositides, catalyzed by phospholipase C purified from ram seminal vesicles, produces phosphorylated inositols containing cyclic phosphate esters (Wilson, D. B., Bross, T. E., Sherman, W. R., Berger, R. A., and Majerus, P. W. (1985) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 82, 4013-4017). In the present study we describe the isolation and characterization of inositol 1:2-cyclic 4-bisphosphate and inositol 1:2-cyclic 4,5-trisphosphate, the two cyclic phosphate products of phospholipase C catalyzed cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, respectively. We established the structures of these two cyclic compounds through 18O labeling of phosphate moieties, phosphomonoesterase digestion, and fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. We examined the physiological effects of these compounds in two systems: saponin-permeabilized platelets loaded with 45Ca2+ and intact Limulus photoreceptors. Both inositol 1:2-cyclic 4,5-trisphosphate and the noncyclic inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, but not inositol 1:2-cyclic 4-bisphosphate, release 45Ca2+ from permeabilized platelets in a concentration-dependent manner. Injection of inositol 1:2-cyclic 4,5-trisphosphate into Limulus ventral photoreceptor cells induces both a change in membrane conductance and a transient increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration similar to those induced by light. We injected inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1:2-cyclic 4,5-trisphosphate into the same photoreceptor cell and found that the cyclic compound is approximately five times more potent than the noncyclic compound in stimulating a conductance change. We speculate that inositol 1:2-cyclic 4,5-trisphosphate may function as a second messenger in stimulated cells."
https://openalex.org/W1535843470,"The alpha subunit (140 kDa) of DNA polymerase III (pol III) holoenzyme has been purified to near-homogeneity from a plasmid-carrying Escherichia coli strain which overproduced the alpha subunit about 20-fold. Pol III core (containing only the alpha, epsilon, and theta subunits), produced at twice the normal level, was also purified in good yield. The isolated alpha subunit has DNA polymerase activity, which is completely inhibited by 10 mM N-ethylmaleimide or 150 mM KCl as observed in the pol III core or holoenzyme. The alpha subunit has an apparent turnover number of 7.7 nucleotides polymerized per s, compared to 20 for pol III core, and is more thermolabile. The alpha subunit lacks the 3'—-5' exonuclease (proofreading) activity of pol III core; neither alpha subunit nor core (nor holoenzyme) possesses any of the previously reported 5'—-3' exonuclease activity. Thus, the alpha polypeptide is the polymerase subunit and epsilon (27 kDa) is the proofreading subunit (Scheuermann, R. H., and Echols, H. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 81, 7747-7751). Together with the theta polypeptide (10 kDa), of unknown function, they form a pol III core with greater stability and catalytic efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W1558267681,"Abstract We have observed previously that removal of extraplatelet Na+ blocks platelet secretion of dense granule contents in response to epinephrine, ADP, and 0.004 unit/ml thrombin, all agents which must mobilize arachidonic acid for its subsequent conversion to cyclooxygenase products in order to elicit platelet secretion. The present studies demonstrate that removal of extraplatelet Na+ blocks arachidonic acid mobilization in response to epinephrine, ADP, and 0.004 unit/ml thrombin without altering arachidonic acid conversion to thromboxane A2. The data also provide several lines of evidence which suggest that the blockade of arachidonic acid release due to removal of extraplatelet Na+ is a manifestation of blockade of Na+/H+ exchange system. 1) There is a concentration-dependent effect of extraplatelet Na+ (EC50 congruent to 55 mM) on [3H]arachidonic acid release such that mobilization is observed when [Na+]o greater than [Na+]i. 2) Increasing extraplatelet [H+] (i.e. decreasing extraplatelet pH from pH 7.35 to 6.8) causes a concentration-dependent decline in stimulus-provoked [3H]arachidonic acid release. 3) Ethylisopropylamiloride and other potent 5-amino analogs of amiloride block [3H]arachidonic acid release with a potency that parallels their effects on Na+/H+ exchange in other cellular systems. None of the above manipulations alter primary aggregation induced by epinephrine, ADP, or 0.004 unit/ml thrombin, indicating that stimulus-receptor binding, subsequent exposure of fibrinogen receptors, and fibrinogen-mediated platelet-platelet cross-linking are not significantly inhibited by [3H]arachidonic acid release in response to greater than 0.1 unit/ml thrombin, a stimulus that can elicit platelet secretion in the absence of products of the cyclooxygenase pathway. Therefore, Na+/H+ exchange may selectively modulate arachidonic acid mobilization in response to the so-called weak agonists, agonists that require this mobilization to effect vigorous platelet aggregation and dense granule secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2052186724,"Papillomaviruses (PV) contain several conserved genes that may encode nonstructural proteins; however, none of these predicted gene products have been identified. Papillomavirus E6 genes are retained and expressed as RNA in PV-associated human and animal carcinomas and cell lines. This suggests that the E6 gene product may be important in the maintenance of the malignant phenotype. The E6 open reading frame of the bovine papillomavirus (BPV) genome has been identified as one of two BPV genes that can independently transform mouse cells in vitro. A polypeptide encoded by this region of BPV was produced in a bacterial expression vector and used to raise antisera. The antisera specifically immunoprecipitated the predicted 15.5-kilodalton BPV E6 protein from cells transformed by the E6 gene. The E6 protein was identified in both the nuclear and membrane fractions of these transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2095475642,"The adenovirus EIA and pseudorabies virus immediate early (IE) proteins induce transcription from transfected viral and nonviral genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II (class II genes). These proteins have now been shown also to activate transcription of transfected genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III (class III genes). As previously observed for class II genes, this stimulation of class III gene transcription was much greater for transfected genes than for the major endogenous cellular class III genes. Extracts made from cell lines stably expressing a transfected pseudorabies virus IE gene were 10 to 20 times more active in the in vitro transcription of exogenously added class III genes than extracts of the parental cell line. These results indicate that the E1A and IE proteins stimulate the expression of class III genes by a mechanism similar to the mechanism for stimulation of class II gene transcription by these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1514079210,"The gene for the prototype acute phase reactant, C-reactive protein, has been isolated from two lambda phage libraries containing inserted human DNA fragments using synthetic oligonucleotide probes. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicates that after coding for a signal peptide of 18 amino acids and the first two amino acids of the mature protein, there is an intron of 278 base pairs followed by the nucleotide sequence for the remaining 204 amino acids. The intron is unusual in that it contains on the positive strand a poly(A) stretch 16 nucleotides long and a poly(GT) region 30 nucleotides long which could adopt the Z-form of DNA. The nucleotide sequence reported here confirms the amino acid sequence of mature C-reactive protein as originally reported except that it codes for an additional 19 amino acids beginning at position 62. Thus DNA sequence analysis predicts that the mature protein consists of 206 amino acids rather than 187 as originally reported. The mRNA cap site is located 104 nucleotides from the start of the signal peptide and there is a 3' noncoding region 1.2 kilobase pairs in length. The gene has a typical promoter containing the sequences TATAAAT and CAAT 29 and 81 base pairs upstream, respectively, of the cap site."

https://openalex.org/W1532908260,"The intracellular pH (pHi) changes resulting from chemotactic factor-induced activation of Na+/H+ exchange in isolated human neutrophils were characterized. Intracellular pH was measured from the equilibrium distribution of [14C]-5,5-dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione and from the fluorescence of 6-carboxyfluorescein. Exposure of cells to 0.1 microM N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) in 140 mM Na+ medium at extracellular pH (pHo) 7.40 led to a rise in pHi along an exponential time course (rate coefficient approximately 0.55 min-1). By 10 min, a new steady-state pHi was reached (7.75-7.80) that was 0.55-0.60 units higher than the resting pHi of control cells (7.20-7.25). The initial rate of H+ efflux from the cells (approximately 15 meq/liter X min), calculated from the intrinsic intracellular buffering power of approximately 50 mM/pH, was comparable to the rate of net Na+ influx (approximately 17 meq/liter X min), an observation consistent with a 1:1 stoichiometry for Na+/H+ exchange. This counter-transport could be inhibited by amiloride (apparent Ki approximately 75 microM). When either the external ([Na+]o) or internal Na ([Na+]i) concentrations, pHo, or pHi were varied independently, the new steady-state [Na+]i and pHi values in FMLP-stimulated cells were those corresponding to a chemical equilibrium distribution of Na+ and H+ across the cell membrane. By analogy to other activated cells, these results indicate that an alkalinization of pHi in human neutrophils is mediated by a chemotactic factor-induced exchange of internal H+ for external Na+."
https://openalex.org/W2094222110,"Mutations of the cut locus (ct) of Drosophila can be divided into four groups based on their phenotypes and complementation patterns. Each group alters the phenotype of a different set of tissues. Two hundred kilobases of ct DNA, located in 7B1-2, have been cloned by chromosomal walking, and the cloned sequences have been used to analyze more than 40 mutants. Based on the location of transposable element mutations and the extent of deficiencies and an inversion, four cut locus regions can be defined. Mutations in each region affect the phenotype of a different set of tissues. The most centromere proximal region contains mutations that are null for cut locus function. Within individual regions, a higher level of organization can be detected."
https://openalex.org/W2021704920,"The role of serotonin axons in modulating the norepinephrine neurotransmission system in rat brain was investigated. Selective lesions of the forebrain serotonergic system were made by injecting 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine into the midbrain raphe nuclei. Four to six weeks after the lesion, the uptake of 3H-labeled serotonin in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus was reduced by more than 90 percent, while neither the uptake of 3H-labeled norepinephrine nor the content of norepinephrine was affected in either tissue. The number of beta-adrenergic receptors, as measured by radioligand binding with 3H-labeled dihydroalprenolol, was increased in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats with lesions. Similarly, specific lesions of central serotonin axons produced by systemically administered p-chloramphetamine resulted in an increase in the binding of 3H-labeled dihydroalprenolol to beta-adrenergic receptors and in the production of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate in response to isoproterenol. These results indicate that serotonin axons may regulate beta-adrenergic receptor number and function in brain."
https://openalex.org/W2007494274,"The mechanism of cellular transformation by the human T-cell leukemia viruses (HTLV) is thought to involve a novel gene known as the x gene. This gene is essential for HTLV replication and acts by enhancing transcription from the HTLV long terminal repeat. The HTLV x gene product may also cause aberrant transcription of normal cellular genes, resulting in transformation of the infected cells. Although there is no evidence as yet for such a mechanism, it was shown that the HTLV-II x gene product can activate transcription from adenovirus E1A-dependent early promoters and therefore has the potential to activate cellular genes. It was also shown that the adenovirus and herpes pseudorabies immediate early proteins activate expression from the HTLV-I and HTLV-II long terminal repeats, though at lower levels than with the x gene product. These findings indicate possible common mechanisms of action for transcription-regulatory genes of distinct viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2073879280,"The duplicated human embryonic α-like globin genes encode a 5′ functional zeta (ζ2) gene and a highly homologous pseudogene (ψζ1). We have identified chromosomes with a ζ2-ζ1 rather than a ζ2-ψζ1 arrangement by genomic mapping and oligonucleotide analysis. The DNA sequence of a cloned downstream ζ-like gene provides direct evidence for the conversion of a ψζ1→ζ1 gene, by a ζ2 gene. We present data suggesting that this gene conversion, which removed the only identifiable inactivating mutation in the ψζ1 gene, was an interchromosomal event. The ζ2-ζ1 arrangement is common in all eight populations studied representing a previously undescribed type of polymorphism between individuals. Stable mRNA transcripts from the converted gene are absent at 16–20 weeks of gestation when transcripts from the ζ2 gene are readily detectable."
https://openalex.org/W1649730470,"The nature of Na+ fluxes in resting and in chemotactic factor-activated human neutrophils was investigated. In resting cells, ouabain-insensitive unidirectional 22Na+ in- and effluxes represented passive electrodiffusional fluxes through ion channels: they were nonsaturable and voltage-dependent (PNa = 4.3 X 10(-9) cm/s). Amiloride (1 mM) had little effect on resting 22Na+ influx (approximately 0.8 meq/liter X min), thereby suggesting a minor contribution of Na+/H+ exchange and a lack of amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels. When neutrophils were exposed to the chemotactic tripeptide N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP, 0.1 microM), 22Na+ influx was stimulated approximately 30-fold (initial rate approximately 22 meq/liter X min). The FMLP-induced 22Na+ influx was saturable with respect to external Na+ (Km 26-35 mM, Vmax approximately 28 meq/liter X min), was electroneutral, and could be competitively inhibited by amiloride (Ki 10.6 microM). From a resting value of approximately 30 meq/liter of cell water, internal Na+ in FMLP-stimulated cells rose exponentially to reach a concentration of approximately 60 meq/liter by 10-15 min. This uptake was blocked by amiloride. FMLP also stimulated the efflux of 22Na+ which followed a single exponential time course (rate coefficient approximately 0.16 min-1). The FMLP-induced 22Na+ fluxes were similar to those observed with 10 microM monensin, a known Na+/H+ exchanging ionophore. The data indicate that FMLP activates an otherwise quiescent, amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchange. Furthermore, all of the FMLP-induced 22Na+ fluxes can be satisfactorily accounted for by transport through the exchanger, leaving little room for an appreciable increase in Na+ conductance."
https://openalex.org/W1481006558,"We re-examined the kinetics of the bisphosphatase reaction of rat hepatic 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase after depleting the enzyme of bound fructose 6-phosphate and found a hyperbolic dependence on fructose 2,6-bisphosphate at concentrations below 100 nM. The Michaelis constant was 4 nM, the Vmax was about 12 nmol X mg-1 X min-1 at 22 degrees C but the substrate inhibited at concentrations above 100 nM. Both phosphate and alpha-glycerol phosphate strongly inhibited phosphoenzyme formation and hydrolytic rate below 100 nM, but relieved the inhibition by substrate at higher concentrations probably by antagonizing substrate binding. A number of observations support the proposition that the phosphoenzyme is a necessary participant in catalysis. 1) The amount of phosphoenzyme measured during steady-state hydrolysis as a function of substrate concentration correlated with the velocity profile. 2) Rapid mixing experiments demonstrated that over a broad range of substrate concentrations phosphoenzyme formation was faster than the net rate of hydrolysis. 3) Both phosphate and alpha-glycerol phosphate inhibited the rate of phosphoenzyme formation and, at low substrate concentrations, reduced the steady-state phosphoenzyme levels. The latter correlated with inhibition of substrate hydrolysis. 4) Both phosphate and alpha-glycerol phosphate stimulate the rate of phosphoenzyme breakdown, consistent with their stimulation of substrate hydrolysis at high substrate concentrations. 5) The fractional rate of phosphoenzyme breakdown, which was pH and substrate dependent, multiplied by the amount of phosphoenzyme obtained in the steady state at that pH and substrate concentration approximated the observed rate of hydrolysis. We conclude that the phosphoenzyme is a reaction intermediate in the hepatic fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1559174460,"The stereochemistry and double bond geometry of a novel series of leukocyte-derived arachidonic acid metabolites, the lipoxins, was determined by comparison to pure unambiguous synthetic standards. The lipoxins were found to be a mixture of four lipoxin A isomers and two lipoxin B isomers. In determining the biosynthesis of these compounds, they were shown to be formed via a tetraene epoxide. In addition, it was shown that all of the lipoxin isomers formed by the incubation of 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid with human leukocytes were also formed by nonenzymatic hydrolysis of this tetraene epoxide."
https://openalex.org/W1517820583,"Abstract Pancreatic polypeptide is a 36-amino acid peptide which inhibits pancreatic exocrine function. We have previously determined from the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA that pancreatic polypeptide is derived from a 95-amino acid precursor, prepropancreatic polypeptide. Pulse-chase studies have suggested that the precursor is cleaved to produce three peptides: pancreatic polypeptide, an icosapeptide, and a smaller peptide. In the present study, we have used the cloned cDNA as a hybridization probe to isolate the pancreatic polypeptide gene from a human bacteriophage genomic library. The nucleotide sequence of 2.8 kilobases of DNA representing the entire human pancreatic polypeptide gene was determined. The gene contains four exons and three introns. Exon 1 encodes the 5'-untranslated region of the mRNA, exon 2 encodes the signal sequence and the sequence of pancreatic polypeptide, exon 3 encodes the icosapeptide, and exon 4 encodes a carboxyl-terminal heptapeptide and the 3'-untranslated region of the mRNA. By Southern blot analysis, the gene detected in a pancreatic polypeptide-producing islet cell tumor was indistinguishable from that in normal human leukocytes. The structure of the human pancreatic polypeptide gene is consistent with the hypothesis that prepropancreatic polypeptide generates three distinct peptides, each encoded by a separate exon. Increased expression of pancreatic polypeptide in the islet cell tumor does not appear to be correlated with major alterations in pancreatic polypeptide gene structure."
https://openalex.org/W1571916657,"125I-Transferrin binding to lymphoblastoid K562 and Daudi cells markedly increased after exposure of the cells to culture conditions that stimulated proliferation. Treatment of these cells with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) resulted in concurrent inhibition of cell growth and of the rise in transferrin binding. Scatchard analyses revealed that IFN reduced the number of transferrin receptors without altering the binding constant. When 125I-transferrin binding was measured using permeabilized cells, the IFN-induced reduction of binding was comparable to that observed with intact cells, indicating that IFN diminished the total number of cellular transferrin receptors. We also found that addition of IFN-alpha to phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human lymphocytes inhibited the mitogen-induced enhancement of [3H]thymidine incorporation as well as surface binding of 125I-transferrin. Our findings suggest that the decrease in transferrin receptor expression on IFN-alpha-treated cells may be one of the mechanisms responsible for the antiproliferative action of IFN."

https://openalex.org/W1996900767,"A primary intracellular substrate for pp60v-src kinase in a variety of avian and mammalian cells is a protein of 34 to 39 kilodaltons (kD). After incubation of chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) with [3H]myristic acid for 4 hours, the 36-kD protein contained covalently bound myristic acid by several criteria: (i) the radioactively labeled material comigrated with the 36-kD protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels in one and two dimensions, (ii) the labeled material was insoluble in chloroform-methanol, and (iii) radioactively labeled myristate could be recovered from the purified 36-kD protein. The resistance of the acyl fatty acid moiety to hydrolysis by hydroxylamine suggested that the covalent linkage to the 36-kD protein may be through an amide linkage. The [3H]myristic-acid labeling of the 36-kD protein in Rous sarcoma virus-transformed CEF showed a reduction of up to 45 percent when compared to an identical amount of 36-kD protein derived from normal cells; this reduction was not due to general changes in myristic acid metabolism in transformed cells."

https://openalex.org/W2111344222,"The actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activities of phosphorylated Acanthamoeba myosins IA and IB were previously found to have a highly cooperative dependence on myosin concentration (Albanesi, J. P., Fujisaki, H., and Korn, E. D. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 11174-11179). This behavior is reflected in the requirement for a higher concentration of F-actin for half-maximal activation of the myosin Mg2+-ATPase at low ratios of myosin:actin (noncooperative phase) than at high ratios of myosin:actin (cooperative phase). These phenomena could be explained by a model in which each molecule of the nonfilamentous myosins IA and IB contains two F-actin-binding sites of different affinities with binding of the lower affinity site being required for expression of actin-activated ATPase activity. Thus, enzymatic activity would coincide with cross-linking of actin by myosin. This theoretical model predicts that shortening the actin and increasing their number concentration at constant total F-actin should increase the myosin concentration required to obtain the cooperative increase in activity and should decrease the F-actin concentration required to reach half-maximal activity at low myosin:actin ratios. These predictions have been experimentally confirmed by shortening actin by addition of plasma gelsolin, an F-actin capping/severing protein. In addition, we have found that actin filaments as short as the 1:2 gelsolin-actin complex can significantly activate Acanthamoeba myosin I."
https://openalex.org/W1578058620,"The types and subunit composition of cAMP-dependent protein kinases in soluble rat ovarian extracts were investigated. Results demonstrated that three peaks of cAMP-dependent kinase activity could be resolved using DEAE-cellulose chromatography. Based on the sedimentation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase and regulatory subunits using sucrose density gradient centrifugation, identification of 8-N3[32P]cAMP labeled RI and RII in DEAE-cellulose column and sucrose gradient fractions by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Scatchard analysis of the cAMP-stimulated activation of the eluted peaks of kinase activity, the following conclusions were drawn regarding the composition of the three peaks of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity: peak 1, eluting with less than or equal to 0.05 M potassium phosphate, consisted of the type I form of cAMP-dependent protein kinase; peak 2, eluting with 0.065-0.11 M potassium phosphate, consisted of free RI and a type II tetrameric holoenzyme; peak 3, eluting with 0.125 M potassium phosphate, consisted of an apparent RIIC trimer, followed by the elution with 0.15 M potassium phosphate of free RII. The regulatory subunits were confirmed as authentic RI and RII based upon their molecular weights and autophosphorylation characteristics. The more basic elution of the type II holoenzyme with free RI was not attributable to the ionic properties of the regulatory subunits, based upon the isoelectric points of photolabeled RI and RII and upon the elution location from DEAE-cellulose of RI and RII on dissociation from their respective holoenzymes by cAMP. This is the first report of a type II holoenzyme eluting in low salt fractions with free RI, and of the presence of an apparent RIIC trimer in a soluble tissue extract."
https://openalex.org/W2139883799,"The thymidine nucleotide sources present during herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection were examined. It was concluded that the source of dTTP in HSV-2-infected cells is not only derived from the ribonucleotide reductase-catalyzed de novo pathway, but also from host DNA. When the de novo pathway was inhibited by the addition of hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase, the dTTP levels were maintained by a compensatory increase in dTTP derived from host DNA. The utilization of host DNA-derived dTTP for viral DNA synthesis was demonstrated. In spite of an increased contribution of dTTP from host DNA in the presence of hydroxyurea, the level of utilization of host DNA-derived dTTP appeared to remain constant. More than one dTTP pool in virus-infected cells is implicated."
https://openalex.org/W1533930495,"We have studied synthesis of apolipoprotein E (apo-E) and apo-E mRNA in cultures of peripheral blood human monocyte macrophages (M-M cultures) obtained from a patient with familial apolipoprotein E deficiency. We have found that the M-M cultures of the apo-E-deficient patients contained two apo-E mRNA species with slightly different molecular weight as compared to normal apo-E mRNA. The apo-E mRNA concentration of the apo-E-deficient cultures was approximately 50-fold reduced as compared to the normal cultures, whereas the actin mRNA concentrations were identical in both M-M cultures. Genomic blotting analysis using a full-length apo-E cDNA clone as hybridization probe did not show gross differences between the restriction patterns of the DNA obtained from the apo-E-deficient patient and two normal controls. When normal M-M cultures were grown in media containing [35S]methionine they synthesized and secreted apo-E into the culture media. In contrast we could not detect any intracellular or extracellular apo-E in the patient's M-M cultures grown under identical conditions. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that familial apo-E deficiency results from structural apo-E gene mutation(s). The putative mutation(s) affect either the transcription of the apo-E gene or the processing of the primary apo-E mRNA transcript. These abnormalities are associated with low levels of synthesis of aberrant apo-E mRNA forms which are either very unstable or cannot be translated into protein."
https://openalex.org/W1513662260,"Studies on the induction of the manganese-containing superoxide dismutase in several strains of Escherichia coli with different mutations in recA and lexA revealed that the inductions of the Mn-isozyme and of the SOS system by oxygen free radicals are not coregulated. We also studied the synthesis of the manganese-superoxide dismutase in the temperature-dependent, protease-constitutive strain recA441(tif-1) that also contained a lac fusion in an SOS gene. A shift to the temperature at which recA441 has constitutive protease activity did not induce Mn-superoxide dismutase but did induce beta-galactosidase. The data clearly demonstrate that induction of the Mn-superoxide dismutase is independent of the SOS system."
