https://openalex.org/W3134446480,"Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is uncontrolled in many parts of the world; control is compounded in some areas by the higher transmission potential of the B.1.1.7 variant1, which has now been reported in 94 countries. It is unclear whether the response of the virus to vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of the prototypic strain will be affected by the mutations found in B.1.1.7. Here we assess the immune responses of individuals after vaccination with the mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b22. We measured neutralizing antibody responses after the first and second immunizations using pseudoviruses that expressed the wild-type spike protein or a mutated spike protein that contained the eight amino acid changes found in the B.1.1.7 variant. The sera from individuals who received the vaccine exhibited a broad range of neutralizing titres against the wild-type pseudoviruses that were modestly reduced against the B.1.1.7 variant. This reduction was also evident in sera from some patients who had recovered from COVID-19. Decreased neutralization of the B.1.1.7 variant was also observed for monoclonal antibodies that target the N-terminal domain (9 out of 10) and the receptor-binding motif (5 out of 31), but not for monoclonal antibodies that recognize the receptor-binding domain that bind outside the receptor-binding motif. Introduction of the mutation that encodes the E484K substitution in the B.1.1.7 background to reflect a newly emerged variant of concern (VOC 202102/02) led to a more-substantial loss of neutralizing activity by vaccine-elicited antibodies and monoclonal antibodies (19 out of 31) compared with the loss of neutralizing activity conferred by the mutations in B.1.1.7 alone. The emergence of the E484K substitution in a B.1.1.7 background represents a threat to the efficacy of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Sera from vaccinated individuals and some monoclonal antibodies show a modest reduction in neutralizing activity against the B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2; but the E484K substitution leads to a considerable loss of neutralizing activity."

The requisite spin polarization of the charge carriers is usually achieved with ferromagnetic contacts and applied magnetic fields, but Kim et al. report on a room-temperature spin-LED that relies instead on a chiral-induced spin selectivity organic layer. This layer selectively injected spin-polarized holes into metal halide perovskite nanocrystals, where they radiatively recombined with unpolarized electrons with an efficiency of 2.6%.

Gudmundsson et al. analyzed thousands of time series of river flows and hydrological extremes across the globe and compared them with model simulations of the terrestrial water cycle (see the Perspective by Hall and Perdigão). They found that the observed trends can only be explained if the effects of climate change are included. Their analysis shows that human influence on climate has affected the magnitude of low, mean, and high river flows on a global scale. Science , this issue p. 1159 ; see also p. 1096"

Using culture-dependent and -independent methods, we discovered that Debaryomyces hansenii preferentially localized to and was abundant within incompletely healed intestinal wounds of mice and inflamed mucosal tissues of CD human subjects. D. hansenii cultures from injured mice and inflamed CD tissues impaired colonic healing when introduced into injured conventionally raised or gnotobiotic mice. We reisolated D. hansenii from injured areas of these mice, fulfilling Koch's postulates. Mechanistically, D. hansenii impaired mucosal healing through the myeloid cell-specific type 1 interferon-CCL5 axis. Taken together, we have identified a fungus that inhabits inflamed CD tissue and can lead to dysregulated mucosal healing."

Rösch et al. report that with just the right β-diketiminate ligand and an assist from potassium as terminal reductant, calcium can mediate dinitrogen reduction. Crystallography and spectroscopic characterization revealed a product in which doubly reduced dinitrogen adopted a side-on bridging motif between two calcium centers. A subsequent reaction with coordinated tetrahydrofuran appeared to release diazene. Science , this issue p. 1125"

However, it is highly unstable outside of ultrahigh vacuum conditions and oxidizes readily, which hampers exploration of its properties. Li et al. hydrogenated these materials with atomic hydrogen and showed that borophane has a lower local work function. This material is stable for days in air, and borophene can be recovered simply by thermally driving off the hydrogen. Science , this issue p. 1143"
https://openalex.org/W3135360764,"The lung alveolus is the functional unit of the respiratory system required for gas exchange. During the transition to air breathing at birth, biophysical forces are thought to shape the emerging tissue niche. However, the intercellular signaling that drives these processes remains poorly understood. Applying a multimodal approach, we identified alveolar type 1 (AT1) epithelial cells as a distinct signaling hub. Lineage tracing demonstrates that AT1 progenitors align with receptive, force-exerting myofibroblasts in a spatial and temporal manner. Through single-cell chromatin accessibility and pathway expression (SCAPE) analysis, we demonstrate that AT1-restricted ligands are required for myofibroblasts and alveolar formation. These studies show that the alignment of cell fates, mediated by biophysical and AT1-derived paracrine signals, drives the extensive tissue remodeling required for postnatal respiration."
https://openalex.org/W3134589597,"The core symptoms of many neurological disorders have traditionally been thought to be caused by genetic variants affecting brain development and function. However, the gut microbiome, another important source of variation, can also influence specific behaviors. Thus, it is critical to unravel the contributions of host genetic variation, the microbiome, and their interactions to complex behaviors. Unexpectedly, we discovered that different maladaptive behaviors are interdependently regulated by the microbiome and host genes in the Cntnap2-/- model for neurodevelopmental disorders. The hyperactivity phenotype of Cntnap2-/- mice is caused by host genetics, whereas the social-behavior phenotype is mediated by the gut microbiome. Interestingly, specific microbial intervention selectively rescued the social deficits in Cntnap2-/- mice through upregulation of metabolites in the tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis pathway. Our findings that behavioral abnormalities could have distinct origins (host genetic versus microbial) may change the way we think about neurological disorders and how to treat them."
https://openalex.org/W3135715560,"Eukaryotic transcription requires the assembly of a multisubunit preinitiation complex (PIC) composed of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and the general transcription factors. The coactivator Mediator is recruited by transcription factors, facilitates the assembly of the PIC, and stimulates phosphorylation of the Pol II C-terminal domain (CTD) by the TFIIH subunit CDK7. Here, we present the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the human Mediator-bound PIC at a resolution below 4 angstroms. Transcription factor binding sites within Mediator are primarily flexibly tethered to the tail module. CDK7 is stabilized by multiple contacts with Mediator. Two binding sites exist for the Pol II CTD, one between the head and middle modules of Mediator and the other in the active site of CDK7, providing structural evidence for Pol II CTD phosphorylation within the Mediator-bound PIC."
https://openalex.org/W3133645752,"Prior studies indicated that actively using social network sites (SNSs) is positively associated with well-being by enhancing social support and feelings of connectedness. Conversely, passively using SNSs is negatively associated with well-being by fostering upward social comparison and envy. However, the majority of these studies has focused on Facebook. The present research examined the relationships between well-being—satisfaction with life, negative affect, positive affect—and using actively or passively various SNSs—Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok—during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, two mediators were tested: social support and upward social comparison. One thousand four persons completed an online survey during the quarantine measures; the analyses employed structural equation modeling. Results showed that passive usage of Facebook is negatively related to well-being through upward social comparison, whereas active usage of Instagram is positively related to satisfaction with life and negative affect through social support. Furthermore, active usage of Twitter was positively related to satisfaction with life through social support; while passive usage was negatively related to upward social comparison, which, in turn, was associated with more negative affect. Finally, TikTok use was not associated with well-being. Results are discussed in line with SNSs’ architectures and users’ motivations. Future research is required to go beyond methodological and statistical limitations and allow generalization. This study concludes that SNSs must be differentiated to truly understand how they shape human interactions."

https://openalex.org/W3135876264,"A lipid-protein autoimmunity target Several autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and primary antiphospholipid syndrome, are characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs). These molecules can activate the complement and coagulation cascades, which contributes to pathologies such as thrombosis, stroke, and pregnancy complications. Müller-Calleja et al. found that endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) in complex with lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) is the cell-surface target for aPL and mediates its internalization (see the Perspective by Kaplan). aPL binding to EPCR-LBPA resulted in the activation of tissue factor–mediated coagulation and interferon-α production by dendritic cells. Interferon-α, in turn, fueled the expansion of B1a cells, which secrete aPLs. The specific blockade of this target in mice inhibited the development of aPL autoimmunity, offering hope for future therapies for these conditions.

Ruano-Gallego et al. used the mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium to model effector function in vivo. They found that effectors work together as a network, allowing the microbe great flexibility in maintaining pathogenicity. An artificial intelligence platform correctly predicted colonization outcomes of alternative networks from the in vivo data. However, the host was able to bypass the obstacles erected by different effector networks and activate complementary immune responses that cleared the pathogen and induced protective immunity.

https://openalex.org/W3135356350,"Background Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly transmittable virus that continues to disrupt livelihoods, particularly those of low-income segments of society, around the world. In Ethiopia, more specifically in the capital city of Addis Ababa, a sudden increase in the number of confirmed positive cases in high-risk groups of the community has been observed over the last few weeks of the first case. Therefore, this study aims to assess knowledge, practice and associated factors that can contribute to the prevention of COVID-19 among high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. Methods A cross-sectional in person survey (n = 6007) was conducted from 14–30 April, 2020 following a prioritization within high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. The study area targeted bus stations, public transport drivers, air transport infrastructure, health facilities, public and private pharmacies, hotels, government-owned and private banks, telecom centers, trade centers, orphanages, elderly centers, prison, prisons and selected slum areas where the people live in a crowded areas. A questionnaire comprised of four sections (demographics, knowledge, practice and reported symptoms) was used for data collection. The outcomes (knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 and practice) were measured using four items. A multi variable logistic regression was applied with adjustment for potential confounding. Results About half (48%, 95% CI: 46–49) of the study participants had poor knowledge on the transmission mode of COVID-19 whereas six out of ten (60%, 95% CI: 58–61) had good knowledge on prevention methods for COVID-19. The practice of preventive measures towards COVID-19 was found to be low (49%, 95% CI: 48–50). Factors that influence knowledge on COVID-19 transmission mechanisms were female gender, older age, occupation (health care and grocery worker), lower income and the use of the 8335 free call centre. Older age, occupation (being a health worker), middle income, experience of respiratory illness and religion were significantly associated with being knowledgeable about the prevention methods for COVID-19. The study found that occupation, religion, income, knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 were associated with the practice of precautionary measures towards COVID-19. Conclusion The study highlighted that there was moderate knowledge about transmission modes and prevention mechanisms. Similarly, there was moderate practice of measures that contribute towards the prevention of COVID-19 among these priority and high-risk communities of Addis Ababa. There is an urgent need to fill the knowledge gap in terms of transmission mode and prevention methods of COVID-19 to improve prevention practices and control the spread of COVID-19. Use of female public figures and religious leaders could support the effort towards the increase in awareness."

Boscolo-Galazzo et al. show that the efficiency of the biological carbon pump increased over the past 15 million years as the oceans cooled because of a reduction in the rate of the breakdown of sinking organic matter (see the Perspective by Bopp). The resulting redistribution of nutrients at depth could have affected plankton evolution and expanded the mesopelagic “twilight zone” ecosystem. Science , this issue p. 1148 ; see also p. 1099"
https://openalex.org/W3134091775,"Background Low birth weight (LBW) is one of the major determinants of perinatal survival, infant morbidity, and mortality, as well as the risk of developmental disabilities and illnesses in future lives. Though studies were conducted to assess the magnitude and associated factors of low birth weight, most of the studies were at a single center and little information on the regional level. Hence, this study assessed the prevalence and associated factors of low birth weight in Sub-Saharan countries. Method This study was based on secondary data sources from 35 Sub-Saharan countries’ Demography and Health Survey (DHS). For this study, we used the Kids Record (KR file) data set. In the KR file, all under-five children who were born in the last five years preceding the survey in the selected enumeration area who had birth weight data were included for the study. To identify determinants of low birth weight multivariable mixed-effect logistic regression model fitted. Adjusted Odds Ratios (AOR) with a 95% Confidence Interval (CI) and p-value ≤0.05 in the multivariable model were used to declare significant factors associated with low birth weight at birth. Result The pooled prevalence of newborn babies’ low birth weight measured at birth in Sub-Saharan Africa was 9.76% with (95% CI: 9.63% to 9.89%). Female child, women not participated in healthcare decision making, and wider birth intervals, divorced/ separated women, and twin pregnancies associated with increased occurrences of low birth weight, while some level of woman and husband education, antenatal care visits, older maternal age, and multiparity associated with reduced occurrence low birth weight. Conclusion This study revealed that the magnitude of low birth weight was high in sub-Saharan Africa countries. Therefore, the finding suggests that more emphasis is important for women with a lack of support, multiples, and healthcare decision-making problems."
https://openalex.org/W3135197124,"Increased population growth and rapid urbanization have resulted in the generation of large quantities of solid waste across major urban cities in Ghana, outstripping local authorities’ ability to manage and dispose of waste in a sanitary manner. This study explored the perspectives and experiences of municipal waste company managers and supervisors in the Ho municipality of Ghana on solid waste management practices. A qualitative inquiry was conducted by adopting a phenomenological approach, using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions for data collection. A total of 35 participants, made up of 12 managers and 23 supervisors took part in the study. Transcribed data were imported into NVivo 11.0 software for coding. Content analysis was applied to analyze all transcribed data using processes of induction and deduction. The results showed that organizational capacity, resources, and expertise; community factors such as socio-cultural beliefs and a low sense of responsibility towards solid waste management among urban residents; contextual factors such as regulations, and weak enforcement all influence and shape the level of efficiency and effectiveness of solid waste management practices in the study setting. The findings suggest that policy frameworks and procedures implemented to curb poor urban waste management practices should be systematic and thorough in order to tackle the issue of solid waste in the study setting and Ghana in general. The nature of the identified issues and challenges requires multidimensional and multilevel interventions to provide sustainable solutions for managing urban waste in Ghana."

How to focus on visitors who are most helpful to the tourism industry and develop sustainable strategy of operation is a very important question for after the epidemic is over. This study applied two-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) and principal component analysis (PCA) to investigate past statistics from the Tourism Bureau and explore the shopping patterns of tourists who travel to Taiwan. The focus will be on tourists from major countries such as China, Japan, and Southeast Asian countries. According to the analysis of tourists from different countries, the money spent by tourists from different countries is concentrated on different items, and there are subitems that they particularly like to purchase. For the analysis of the purpose of coming to Taiwan, some tourism areas worth developing (such as medical treatment and leisure) are also presented in the research results. Based on these results, and according to the sustainable development goals, specific recommendations for the sustainability strategy of operation are made as a reference for the government and relevant industries. This research also broadens the scope of application of DEA and points out a different direction for future research."

During malaria elimination, the first step is to perform a risk stratification exercise to prioritize interventions. This study aimed to identify malaria risk strata in the ecoepidemiological regions of Colombia.This was a descriptive and retrospective study using cumulative malaria cases in 1,122 municipalities of Colombia from 2010 to 2019. To identify the strata, the criteria proposed by PAHO were adapted. To classify the receptive areas (strata 2, 3, and 4) and nonreceptive areas (stratum 1), 1,600 m above sea level, ecotypes, main malaria vector presence, Plasmodium species prevalence and occurrence of malaria cases were used. The area occupied by the receptive municipalities, the cumulative burden, and the at-risk population in the regions were calculated.Ninety-one percent of the Colombian territory is receptive to the transmission of malaria and includes 749 municipalities with 9,734,271 (9,514,243-9,954,299) million at-risk inhabitants. Stratum 4 accounted for 96.7% of the malaria burden, and cases were concentrated primarily in the Pacific and Uraba-Bajo Cauca-Sinu-San Jorge regions. Plasmodium vivax predominates in most of the receptive municipalities, except in the municipalities of the Pacific region, where P. falciparum predominates. Anopheles albimanus, An. nuneztovari s.l., and An. darlingi were the main vectors in receptive areas.In Colombia, 91.2% of the territory is receptive to the transmission of malaria and is characterized by being both heterogeneous and focused. Stratum 4 contains the greatest burden of disease, with a relatively greater proportion of municipalities with a predominance of P. vivax. However, there is a low proportion of municipalities with P. falciparum mainly in the Pacific region. These findings suggest that the latter be prioritized within the malaria elimination plan in Colombia."

This study aimed to analyze trends in intake and outcomes for hedgehogs admitted into rescue centers in the Czech Republic. In the period from 2010 to 2019, 16,967 European hedgehogs were admitted in 34 rescue centers in the Czech Republic. Most hedgehogs were admitted in September (25.30%) and October (22.14%), the fewest in March (0.96%). Most admitted hedgehogs were hoglets (59.49%). The treatment was successful in 44.39% of admitted hedgehogs; those were subsequently released into the wild. On average, they stayed in rescue centers for 48.77 days (median of 30 days). Death or euthanasia was an outcome for 25.27% and 3.15% of admitted hedgehogs, respectively. Only 0.59% of the hedgehogs remained in captivity with a permanent handicap. The highest release rate was achieved in hedgehogs admitted after falls into pits and other openings (83.19%), whereas the least success was achieved in poisoned hedgehogs (13.21%). An increasing trend (rSp = 0.9273, p &lt; 0.01) was found in the number of hedgehogs admitted to rescue centers during the monitored period. Furthermore, not all of them required human care. Given the fact that less than a half of the admitted hedgehogs could be released, raising public awareness of this issue could help to avoid unnecessary interventions (especially in hoglets)."

We aim to investigate the efficacy of JAK1/2i ruxolitinib in combination with HDACi resminostat in CTCL in vitro.Non-toxic concentrations of ruxolitinib and/or resminostat were administered to MyLa (MF) and SeAx (SS) cells for 24h. Cytotoxicity, cell proliferation and apoptosis were estimated through MTT, BrdU/7AAD and Annexin V/PI assay. Multi-pathway analysis was performed to investigate the effect of JAK1/2i and/or HDACi on JAK/STAT, Akt/mTOR and MAPK signalling pathways.Both drugs and their combination were cytotoxic in MyLa (p<0.05) and in SeAx cell line (p<0.001), inhibited proliferation of MyLa (p<0.001) and SeAx (p<0.001) at 24h, compared to untreated cells. Moreover, combined drug treatment induced apoptosis after 24h (p<0.001) in MyLa, and SeAx (p<0.001). The combination of drugs had a strong synergistic effect with a CI<1. Importantly, the drugs' combination inhibited phosphorylation of STAT3 (p<0.001), Akt (p<0.05), ERK1/2 (p<0.001) and JNK (p<0.001) in MyLa, while it reduced activation of Akt (p<0.05) and JNK (p<0.001) in SeAx.The JAKi/HDACi combination exhibited substantial anti-tumor effects in CTCL cell lines, and may represent a promising novel therapeutic modality for CTCL patients."
https://openalex.org/W3135711765,"Nearly 50% of individuals with long-term HIV infection are affected by the onset of progressive HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). HIV infiltrates the central nervous system (CNS) early during primary infection where it establishes persistent infection in microglia (resident macrophages) and astrocytes that in turn release inflammatory cytokines, small neurotoxic mediators, and viral proteins. While the molecular mechanisms underlying pathology in HAND remain poorly understood, synaptodendritic damage has emerged as a hallmark of HIV infection of the CNS. Here, we report that the HIV viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 induces the formation of aberrant, rod-shaped cofilin-actin inclusions (rods) in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons via a signaling pathway common to other neurodegenerative stimuli including oligomeric, soluble amyloid-β and proinflammatory cytokines. Previous studies showed that synaptic function is impaired preferentially in the distal proximity of rods within dendrites. Our studies demonstrate gp120 binding to either chemokine co-receptor CCR5 or CXCR4 is capable of inducing rod formation, and signaling through this pathway requires active NADPH oxidase presumably through the formation of superoxide (O2-) and the expression of cellular prion protein (PrPC). These findings link gp120-mediated oxidative stress to the generation of rods, which may underlie early synaptic dysfunction observed in HAND."
https://openalex.org/W3134099899,"Background Placebos can reduce physical symptoms even when provided with full honesty and disclosure. Yet, the precise mechanisms underlying the effects of “open-label placebos” (OLPs) have remained subject of debate. Furthermore, it is unclear whether OLPs are similarly effective when provided remotely, as is sometimes required e.g. in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Methods In a randomized-controlled trial, we examined the effects of OLP plus treatment as usual (TAU) compared to TAU alone on symptom reduction in people with allergic rhinitis ( N = 54) over the course of two weeks. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, OLP was provided remotely (i.e. sent via postal service). To investigate the potential influence of the clinical encounter on the effects of OLP, we manipulated the perception of the virtual clinical encounter, both with respect to verbal and nonverbal factors (augmented vs. limited encounter). Results The results of the manipulation check confirmed that the augmented clinical encounter was evaluated more positively than the limited encounter, in terms of perceived warmth of the provider. Participants from all treatment groups showed significant symptom reduction from baseline to two weeks later, but OLP had no incremental effect over TAU. Participants benefitted more from OLP when they did not take any other medication against allergic symptoms than when taking medication on demand. When controlling for baseline symptoms, a significant treatment by encounter interaction was found, pointing to greater symptom improvement in the OLP group when the encounter was augmented, whereas the control group improved more when the encounter was limited. Discussion The study demonstrates that providing OLP and enhancing the encounter remotely is possible, but their effectiveness might be lower in comparison to previous studies relying on physical patient-provider interaction. The study raises questions for future research about the potential and challenges of remote placebo studies and virtual clinical encounters. The study has been registered as a clinical trial at ISRCTN (record number: 39018)."
https://openalex.org/W3135183493,"Adult mammalian astrocytes are sensitive to inflammatory stimuli in the context of neuropathology or mechanical injury, thereby affecting functional outcomes of the central nervous system (CNS). In contrast, glial cells residing in the spinal cord of regenerative vertebrates exhibit a weak astroglial reaction similar to those of mammals in embryonic stages. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) participates in multiple neurological disorders by activation of glial and immune cells. However, the mechanism of astrocytes from regenerative species, such as gecko astrocytes (gAS), in resistance to MIF-mediated inflammation in the severed cords remains unclear. Here, we compared neural stem cell markers among gAS, as well as adult (rAS) and embryonic (eAS) rat astrocytes. We observed that gAS retained an immature phenotype resembling rat eAS. Proinflammatory activation of gAS with gecko (gMIF) or rat (rMIF) recombinant protein was unable to induce the production of inflammatory cytokines, despite its interaction with membrane CD74 receptor. Using cross-species screening of inflammation-related mediators from models of gMIF- and rMIF-induced gAS and rAS, we identified Vav1 as a key regulator in suppressing the inflammatory activation of gAS. The gAS with Vav1 deficiency displayed significantly restored sensitivity to inflammatory stimuli. Meanwhile, gMIF acts to promote the migration of gAS through regulation of CXCL8 following cord lesion.

Constitutively, membrane of astrocyte expresses a profile of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) similar to that of microglia, such as the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain proteins (NODs), and scavenger receptors (SRs) (2Colombo E.

Astrocytes, however, are essential for axonal growth, neuronal survival, and formation of synapse during the development of CNS (13Sofroniew M.V. Vinters H.V. Astrocytes: Biology and pathology.Acta Neuropathol. 2010; 119: 7-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (3265) Google Scholar). Inspired by these amazing features, fetal (immature) astrocytes are tested in therapeutic applications in the damaged CNS through transplantation. Indeed, the immature astrocytes are observed to benefit for neuroprotection and axonal growth, rather than deteriorate the lesion environment such as forming glial scar or triggering innate immunity (14Wang J.J.

The outcomes of transplantation are tightly associated with the embryonic stages of astrocyte acquisition. Transcriptome analysis of astrocytes isolated from developing and mature CNS identifies an entirely different molecular repertoire, which governs distinct morphology and function (16Haas C.

However, the mechanism of the astroglial reaction weakening in immature astrocytes is yet to be elucidated. Several vertebrates such as fish and some amphibians can successfully regenerate their spinal cord following injury. The CNS of these regenerative models is thought to lack “real” astrocytes. Instead, a population of glial cells builds a “glial bridge” (or tube in amphibian) favoring for the axonal elongation at the lesion sites (20Goldshmit Y. Sztal T.E. Jusuf P.R. Hall T.E.

Salamander spinal cord regeneration: The ultimate positive control in vertebrate spinal cord regeneration.Dev. Biol. 2017; 432: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Comparatively, glial cells of the regenerative spinal cord can hardly form glial scar or activate excessive inflammation (23Zukor K.A. Kent D.T. Odelberg S.J. Meningeal cells and glia establish a permissive environment for axon regeneration after spinal cord injury in newts.Neural Dev. 2011; 6: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), which in turn decrease GFAP and elevate protein levels of neural stem cell (NSC)-related factors including fibroblast growth factor and Nestin after spinal cord injury (20Goldshmit Y. Sztal T.E. Jusuf P.R. Hall T.E. Nguyen-Chi M. Currie P.D. Fgf-dependent glial cell bridges facilitate spinal cord regeneration in zebrafish.J.

These physiological features are very similar to those of mammalian immature astrocytes in the developing spinal cord. Given the immunosuppressive activity manifested by the glial cells or immature astrocytes, uncovering the underlying mechanism may provide a therapeutic clue for the inflammatory neuropathology mediated by the adult counterparts of mammals. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a potent proinflammatory cytokine that is expressed by a wide spectrum of cell types in multiple tissues (25Calandra T. Roger T. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor: A regulator of innate immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). As a critical mediator of innate and adaptive immunity, MIF is implicated in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, colitis, asthma, pancreatitis, and cancer (25Calandra T. Roger T. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor: A regulator of innate immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 791-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar, 26Lue H. Kleemann R. Calandra T. Roger T. Bernhagen J. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF): Mechanisms of action and role in disease.Microbes Infect. 2002; 4: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In the pathological CNS, MIF is highly induced within astrocytes, neurons, microglia, ependymal cells, and epithelial cells of the choroid plexus, thereby associated with exacerbation of neurological disorders or severed cord (27Koda M.

Kahn J. Israelson A. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor: A multifaceted cytokine implicated in multiple neurological diseases.Exp. Neurol. 2018; 301: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). MIF has been found to promote the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from rodent astrocytes, in association with activation of excessive inflammation in the CNS (10Zhou Y. Guo W. Zhu Z. Hu Y. Wang Y. Zhang X. Wang W. Du N. Song T. Yang K. Guan Z. Wang Y. Guo A.

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor facilitates prostaglandin E2 production of astrocytes to tune inflammatory milieu following spinal cord injury.J. Neuroinflammation. 2019; 16: 85Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Supposing that the glial cells or immature astrocytes are resistant to the activation of proinflammatory MIF, and the intrinsic mechanism might be conservative for other mediators, it will be extremely informative for controlling astrocyte-induced inflammation in the neurological disorder if the intricate regulatory mechanism has been delineated. In the present study, amniotic geckos were selected as an animal model for their ability in circumventing excessive inflammation and evoking less astrocytic responses in the severed spinal cord (31Dong Y. Gu Y. Huan Y. Wang Y. Liu Y. Liu M. Ding F. Gu X. Wang Y. HMGB1 protein does not mediate the inflammatory response in spontaneous spinal cord regeneration: A hint for CNS regeneration.J. Biol.

Different astrocytic activation between adult Gekko japonicus and rats during wound healing in vitro.PLoS One. 2015; 10e0127663PubMed Google Scholar). Transcriptome analysis of astrocytes from adult geckos (gAS), adult (rAS) and embryonic rats (E18, eAS) demonstrated that gAS expressed high abundance of NSC markers, a feature of immature astrocytes. Proinflammatory MIF was unable to induce the inflammatory responses of gAS, rather than rAS. Integration of inflammation-related signal cascades in MIF-stimulated gAS and rAS identified that Vav1 protein was a key regulator responsible for suppressing inflammation in the gAS, and a deficient expression of the protein could restore the cellular sensitivity to the inflammatory stimuli. Our results identified a novel player that mediated inflammation of astrocytes, which might be beneficial for the therapeutic development of neurological diseases. Though reptiles have not retained the same regenerative ability as shown in anamniotes following spinal cord injury, several lizards and turtles still exhibit anatomical and functional recovery of the lumbar and thoracic cord after complete transection (33Rehermann M.I. Marichal N. Russo R.E. Trujillo-Cenoz O. Neural reconnection in the transected spinal cord of the freshwater turtle Trachemys dorbignyi.J. Comp.

Morphol. 2020; 281: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). To shed light on the physiological property of adult astrocytes isolated from gecko spinal cord, we screened the profile of NSC markers by transcriptome sequencing and made a comparison with those of eAS and rAS. The purity of the isolated astrocytes reached above 95% prior to sequencing, as determined by immunostaining of GFAP. The morphology of gAS appeared to be fibrous type with many long fiber-like processes, and the astrocytic responses to various stimuli were less sensitive than those of the mammals (32Gu Y. Yang J. Chen H. Li J. Xu M. Hua J. Yao J. Wang Y. Liu Y. Liu M. Different astrocytic activation between adult Gekko japonicus and rats during wound healing in vitro.PLoS One. 2015; 10e0127663PubMed Google Scholar). A total of 18 NSC markers were examined on the basis of definition by Kuegler et al. (35Kuegler P.B. Zimmer B. Waldmann T. Baudis B. Ilmjärv S. Hescheler J. Gaughwin P. Brundin P. Mundy W.

Kadereit S. et al.Markers of murine embryonic and neural stem cells, neurons and astrocytes: Reference points for developmental neurotoxicity testing.ALTEX. 2010; 27: 17-42PubMed Google Scholar). Results revealed that 13 out of 18 NSC marker genes were abundantly expressed in the gAS in comparison with those of rAS (RPKM >2-fold). Meanwhile, their expression abundance was much closer between gAS and eAS (Table 1, Table S1). Several typical NSC markers such as Fabp7, Sox2, Pax3, and Pax6 were expressed in the gAS at a ratio of 87- to 60,587-fold comparing with those of the rAS. The molecular profile of gAS reflects an immature cell trait, suggesting a distinct physiological function between the gAS and rAS.Table 1Comparison of neural stem cell markers in gAS, rAS, and eASGenegASrASeASgAS/rASgAS/eASFabp760.5880.001127.60060587.5710.475Sox213.3540.02712.749493.5701.047Pax30.2110.0010.337210.7610.626Sox115.9670.0311.803193.3113.310Cdh290.0300.64329.294140.0283.073Cxcr44.8260.0366.445132.5280.749Sema5b1.6170.0171.90394.9860.850Pax62.4960.0291.55887.0251.602Rtn11.6210.1625.98710.0330.271Chrdl13.2690.3871.1898.4462.750Prkcz1.1320.1650.5026.8492.253Notch14.6621.3704.4373.4031.051Metrn61.76721.46080.3002.8780.769Dbx20.3340.2820.0011.186333.807Mbnl11.6398.4503.6420.1940.450Gata20.0500.4510.0830.1100.598Zic17.83494.13429.2750.0830.268Fgfr20.59526.0976.9260.0230.086 Open table in a new tab Proinflammatory MIF has been shown to be inducibly expressed at the severed cord to mediate neuropathology by binding with CD74 receptor (10Zhou Y.

Injury of gecko spinal cord, however, can induce little production of inflammatory cytokines following tail amputation, though some DAMPs are actively emitted at the lesion sites (31Dong Y. Gu Y. Huan Y. Wang Y. Liu Y. Liu M. Ding F. Gu X. Wang Y. HMGB1 protein does not mediate the inflammatory response in spontaneous spinal cord regeneration: A hint for CNS regeneration.J. Biol.

Bull. 2020; 36: 778-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These indicate that DAMPs are inefficient in activating inflammation of gecko glial cells. Western blot showed that the protein level of gMIF temporally increased at the injured cord following gecko tail amputation (Fig. 1, A and B). Immunostaining demonstrated that the CD74 receptor of MIF was distributed in the GFAP-positive astrocytes of gecko spinal cord, a similar pattern to those of the rat (Fig. 1, C and D). Further examination on gecko primary astrocytes or astrocyte cell line Gsn1 recapitulated the receptor localization in the gAS (Fig. 1, E–G). The data indicate that elevation of gMIF protein levels in the injured cord can potentially mediate cell events of gecko astrocytes via binding to CD74 receptor. To clarify the potential effects of gMIF on the inflammatory activation of gAS, the recombinant gMIF protein was prepared and applied to stimulate the primary cultured gAS or rAS (purity > 92%) at concentration of 0 to 2.5 μg/ml (Fig. 2, A and B). ELISA assays demonstrated that gMIF at various concentration was unable to induce the production of TNF-α and IL-1β from gAS. On the contrary, gMIF significantly promoted the expression of TNF-α and IL-1β protein in rAS (Fig. 2, C and D). To validate that the insensitivity of gMIF in the activation of inflammation results from the unique property of gAS, recombinant rMIF protein was employed to stimulate gAS or rAS at the same concentration as gMIF. Similarly, rMIF was sufficient in inducing the production of TNF-α and IL-1β in rAS, rather than in gAS (Fig. 3, A and B). Even a substitution with the robust proinflammatory cytokine LPS also failed in activating gAS inflammation (Fig. 4, A and B). The results indicate that gAS are insensitive to the proinflammatory stimulation though they express the receptors of DAMPs.Figure 3Analysis of rMIF proinflammatory effects on the gAS and rAS.

Addition of gMIF to the gAS culture resulted in the coprecipitation with CD74, as detected by anti-His or -CD74 antibody (Fig. 5A). The result suggests that gMIF/CD74 regulatory axis remains active in the gAS. Transcriptome sequencing was then carried out to unveil gMIF-mediated intracellular signal cascades of gAS, among which the clues in association with modulating inflammation might be deposited. The gAS were incubated in the culture medium for 12 h and 24 h in the presence or absence of 2.5 μg/ml gMIF. A total of 42 and 6 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found to be dynamically regulated by gMIF at 12 h and 24 h, respectively (Fig. 5, B–D, Table S2). However, GO analysis for biological process demonstrated that these 45 DEGs were irrelevant to regulating inflammation of gAS (data not shown). The data indicate that gMIF/CD74 regulatory axis is unable to activate inflammation of gAS. To uncover the underlying mechanism of MIF-mediated distinct inflammatory effects between gAS and rAS, a cross-species screening for the key mediator(s) in suppressing gMIF-induced inflammation in gAS was then performed. Genes with unaltered expression in gAS after gMIF stimulation were integrated to the DEGs of rAS challenged by rMIF (Table S3) (10Zhou Y. Guo W. Zhu Z. Hu Y. Wang Y. Zhang X. Wang W. Du N. Song T. Yang K. Guan Z. Wang Y. Guo A. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor facilitates production of CCL5 in astrocytes following rat spinal cord injury.J. Neuroinflammation. 2018; 15: 253Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), followed by GO annotation of the intersected inflammation-related genes (Fig. 6, A and B). A total of 234 genes were thus obtained from the integration (Table S4), and GO analysis demonstrated that inflammatory response was among top ten enriched GO terms under biological process (Fig. 6B). A gene regulatory network was further constructed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) Software on the basis of these inflammation-related genes to identify the key mediator(s), highlighting that Vav1, Rac2, and C1QC potentially regulated the differential inflammatory responses between gAS and rAS (Fig. 6C). To validate the deduced function based on bioinformatics, siRNAs of Vav1, Rac2, and C1QC were synthesized and transfected to gAS respectively, for observation of the effects on the production of inflammatory cytokines. Results demonstrated that knockdown of the Vav1, rather than Rac2 and C1QC, was efficient in promoting proinflammatory stimuli-mediated expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in gAS (Fig. 7, A–D, Fig. S1). Vav1 deficiency in gAS also increased the sensitivity to inflammatory stimuli of rMIF or LPS (Fig. S2), indicating that Vav1 is implicated in the inflammatory inactivation of gAS. Vav1 has been shown to mediate cell migration in a cell-type-specific manner. For example, Vav1−/− dendritic cells (DCs) increase rates of migration, while an active form of Vav1 induces the migration of mammary epithelial cells (38Spurrell D.R. Luckashenak N.A. Minney D.C.

Patients and methods Sixty-four participants diagnosed with severe eosinophilic asthma and who had completed 4 months of benralizumab treatment were included in this analysis. Pre-treatment clinical factors were compared between responders and non-responders according to improvements in ACT or FEV 1 . Correlations between the sums of increased Type 2-related inflammatory parameters and changes of ACT or FEV 1 were also evaluated before and after the 4-month treatment. A two-step cluster analysis was performed to identify distinct phenotypes related to benralizumab responsiveness in terms of FEV 1 . Results At the 4-month timepoint, all parameters, except for FeNO, were significantly improved after benralizumab treatment. FEV 1 responders were associated with higher levels of Type 2-related inflammatory parameters. An improvement in FEV 1 but not in ACT was clearly associated with increases in the sums of increased type 2-related inflammation parameters (p = 0.0001). The cluster analysis identified 5 distinct phenotypes of severe eosinophilic asthma according to the variable FEV 1 responsiveness to benralizumab. The greatest response was found in the distinct phenotype of severe eosinophilic asthma, which was characterized by modest increase in total IgE and FeNO relative to blood eosinophils with least exposure to smoking. Conclusion This study, to the best of our knowledge, is the first cluster analysis to report distinct phenotypes related to clinical benralizumab response in a real-world population with severe eosinophilic asthma. These results may help to predict responsiveness to benralizumab in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma."
https://openalex.org/W3134529761,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a crucial role in cancer progression, drug resistance and tumor recurrence. We have recently shown that the Notch pathway determines the tumor-regulatory role of experimentally created 'CAFs'. Here, we examined the status of Notch signaling in human melanoma-associated fibroblasts (MAFs) versus their normal counterparts and tested whether manipulation of the Notch pathway activity in MAFs alters their tumor-regulatory function. Using tissue microarrays, we found that MAFs exhibit decreased Notch pathway activity compared with normal fibroblasts in adjacent and non-adjacent skin. Consistently, MAFs isolated from human metastatic melanoma exhibited lower Notch activity than did normal human fibroblasts, demonstrating that Notch pathway activity is low in MAFs. We then investigated the effect of increasing Notch pathway activity in MAF on melanoma growth in co-cultures and in a mouse co-graft model. We found that activation of the Notch pathway in MAFs significantly restricted melanoma cell growth in vitro and suppressed melanoma skin growth and tumor angiogenesis in vivo. Our study demonstrates that the Notch signaling is inhibited in MAFs. Increase of Notch pathway activity can confer tumor-suppressive function on MAFs. Thus, targeting melanoma by activating Notch signaling in MAF may represent a novel therapeutic approach."

It is known that the magnetotactic Deltaproteobacteria are ubiquitous and inhabit worldwide in the sediments of freshwater and marine environments. Mostly known MTB belonging to the Deltaproteobacteria are dissimilatory sulfate-reducing bacteria that biomineralize bullet-shaped magnetite nanoparticles, but only a few axenic cultures have been obtained so far. Here, we report the isolation, cultivation and characterization of a dissimilatory sulfate-reducing magnetotactic bacterium, which we designate “strain FSS-1”. We found that the strain FSS-1 is a strict anaerobe and uses casamino acids as electron donors and sulfate as an electron acceptor to reduce sulfate to hydrogen sulfide. The strain FSS-1 produced bullet-shaped magnetite nanoparticles in the cells and responded to external magnetic fields. On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the strain FSS-1 is a member of the genus Desulfovibrio , showing a 96.7% sequence similarity to Desulfovibrio putealis strain B7-43 T . Futhermore, the magnetosome gene cluster of strain FSS-1 was different from that of Desulfovibrio magneticus strain RS-1. Thus, the strain FSS-1 is considered to be a novel sulfate-reducing magnetotactic bacterium belonging to the genus Desulfovibrio ."
https://openalex.org/W3033429641,"A hybrid particle ensemble Kalman filter is developed for problems with medium non-Gaussianity, i.e. problems where the prior is very non-Gaussian but the posterior is approximately Gaussian. Such situations arise, e.g., when nonlinear dynamics produce a non-Gaussian forecast but a tight Gaussian likelihood leads to a nearly-Gaussian posterior. The hybrid filter starts by factoring the likelihood. First the particle filter assimilates the observations with one factor of the likelihood to produce an intermediate prior that is close to Gaussian, and then the ensemble Kalman filter completes the assimilation with the remaining factor. How the likelihood gets split between the two stages is determined in such a way to ensure that the particle filter avoids collapse, and particle degeneracy is broken by a mean-preserving random orthogonal transformation. The hybrid is tested in a simple two-dimensional (2D) problem and a multiscale system of ODEs motivated by the Lorenz-‘96 model. In the 2D problem it outperforms both a pure particle filter and a pure ensemble Kalman filter, and in the multiscale Lorenz-‘96 model it is shown to outperform a pure ensemble Kalman filter, provided that the ensemble size is large enough."
https://openalex.org/W3133675122,"Low level of self-management in people with multiple sclerosis (MS) is considered to be a predominant factor that leads to poor rehabilitation efficacy. Studies focusing on the relationship between self-management and psychological variables that can be modified could contribute to expanding the knowledge needed to propose interventional programs aiming at patient activation. This study aimed to analyze whether coping strategies play a mediating role in the association between the perceived impact of MS and level of self-management in people with MS. The cross-sectional study included 382 people with MS. The participants completed the Multiple Sclerosis Self-Management Scale-Revised, Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29, and Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations. The study hypothesis was evaluated using mediation analysis. The STROBE checklist specifically prepared for cross-sectional research was applied in this study for reporting. Results indicate that the emotion- and problem-focused strategies of coping can be treated as mediating the association between the MS impact and level of self-management in people with MS. A negative relationship was found between the perceived MS impact and problem-oriented coping, while a positive relationship was found between problem-oriented coping and self-management. Furthermore, a positive relationship was found between the MS impact and emotion-oriented coping, while a negative relationship was found between emotion-oriented coping and self-management. The indirect role of avoidance-oriented coping was not significant. Our study confirms the role played by coping strategies in individuals' self-management. In MS, self-management determined by perceived MS impact can be controlled by decreasing emotional-coping while increasing problem-coping strategies. Our study imparts new knowledge regarding the potential interventions for improving the level of self-management in people with MS. It indicates that recognition of individuals' illness perceptions as well as maladaptive coping strategies can help health professionals identify those who might be having lower level of self-management."
https://openalex.org/W3135031866,"Focal amplification of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its ligand-independent, constitutively active EGFRvIII mutant form are prominent oncogenic drivers in glioblastoma (GBM). The EGFRvIII gene rearrangement is considered to be an initiating event in the etiology of GBM, however, the mechanistic details of how EGFRvIII drives cellular transformation and tumor maintenance remain unclear. Here, we report that EGFRvIII demonstrates a reliance on PDGFRA co-stimulatory signaling during the tumorigenic process in a genetically engineered autochthonous GBM model. This dependency exposes liabilities that were leveraged using kinase inhibitors treatments in EGFRvIII-expressing GBM patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), where simultaneous pharmacological inhibition of EGFRvIII and PDGFRA kinase activities is necessary for anti-tumor efficacy. Our work establishes that EGFRvIII-positive tumors have unexplored vulnerabilities to targeted agents concomitant to the EGFR kinase inhibitor repertoire."
https://openalex.org/W3135146423,"Mapping of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) can enable less invasive surgery. However, mapping is challenging for cancers of difficult-to-access visceral organs, such as the gallbladder, because the standard method using radioisotopes (RIs) requires preoperative tracer injection. Indocyanine green (ICG) and superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) have also been used as alternative tracers. In this study, we modified a previously reported magnetic probe for laparoscopic use and evaluated the feasibility of detecting SLNs of the gallbladder using a laparoscopic dual tracer method by injecting ICG and SPIO into five swine and one cancer-bearing swine. The laparoscopic probe identified SPIO nanoparticles in the nodes of 4/5 swine in situ , the magnetic field counts were 2.5–15.9 μT, and fluorescence was detected in SLNs in all five swine. ICG showed a visual lymph flow map, and SPIO more accurately identified each SLN with a measurable magnetic field quite similar to the RI. We then developed an advanced gallbladder cancer model with lymph node metastasis using recombination activating gene 2-knockout swine. We identified an SLN in the laparoscopic investigation, and the magnetic field count was 3.5 μT. The SLN was histologically determined to be one of the two metastatic lymph nodes. In conclusion, detecting the SLNs of gallbladder cancer in situ using a dual tracer laparoscopic technique with ICG and SPIO was feasible in a swine model."

MAVIE participants are voluntary members of French households, including overseas territories. Participation in the cohort involves answering individual and household questionnaires and relevant exposures and prospectively reporting injury events during the follow-up. Recruitment and data collection have been in progress since 2014. The number of participants as of the end of the year 2019 was 12,419 from 9,483 households. A total of 8,640 participants provided data during follow-up. Respondents to follow-up were composed of 763 children aged 0–14, 655 teenagers and young adults aged 15–29, 6,845 adults, and 377 people aged 75 or more. At the end of the year 2019, 1,698 participants had reported 2,483 injury events. Children, people aged 50 and more, people with poor self-perceived physical and mental health, people who engage in sports activities, and people with a history of injury during the year before recruitment were more likely to report new injuries. An interactive mobile/web application (MAVIE-Lab) was developed to help volunteers decide on personalized measures to prevent their risks of HLIs. The available data provides an opportunity to analyse multiple exposures at both the individual and household levels that may be associated with an increased risk of trauma. The ongoing analysis includes HLI incidence estimates, the determination of health-related risk factors, a specific study on the risk of home injury, another on sports injuries, and an analysis of the role of cognitive skills and mind wandering. Volunteers form a community that constitutes a population laboratory for preventative initiatives."
https://openalex.org/W3134729878,"The belief that the target of sexism has shifted from women to men is gaining popularity. Yet despite its potential theoretical and practical importance, the belief that men are now the primary target of sexism has not been systematically defined nor has it been reliably measured. In this paper, we define the belief in sexism shift (BSS) and introduce a scale to measure it. We contend that BSS constitutes a new form of contemporary sexism characterized by the perception that anti-male discrimination is pervasive, that it now exceeds anti-female discrimination, and that it is caused by women’s societal advancement. In four studies (N = 666), we develop and test a concise, one-dimensional, 15-item measure of BSS: the BSS scale. Our findings demonstrate that BSS is related to, yet distinct from other forms of sexism (traditional, modern, and ambivalent sexism). Moreover, our results show that the BSS scale is a stable and reliable measure of BSS across different samples, time, and participant gender. The BSS scale is also less susceptible to social desirability concerns than other sexism measures. In sum, the BSS scale can be a valuable tool to help understand a new and potentially growing type of sexism that may hinder women in unprecedented ways."
https://openalex.org/W3135041867,"Background An integrated collaborative care intervention was used to treat primary care patients with comorbid obesity and depression in a randomized clinical trial. To increase wider uptake and dissemination, information is needed on translational potential. Methods The trial collected longitudinal, qualitative data at baseline, 6 months (end of intensive treatment), 12 months (end of maintenance treatment), and 24 months (end of follow-up). Semi-structured interviews (n = 142) were conducted with 54 out of 409 randomly selected trial participants and 37 other stakeholders, such as recruitment staff, intervention staff, and clinicians. Using a Framework Analysis approach, we examined themes across time and stakeholder groups according to the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) framework. Results At baseline, participants and other stakeholders reported being skeptical of the collaborative care approach related to some RE-AIM dimensions. However, over time they indicated greater confidence regarding the potential for future public health impact. They also provided information on barriers and actionable information to enhance program reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. Conclusions RE-AIM provided a useful framework for understanding how to increase the impact of a collaborative and integrative approach for treating comorbid obesity and depression. It also demonstrates the utility of using the framework as a planning tool early in the evidence-generation pipeline."
https://openalex.org/W3134274856,"Previous research suggests that childhood maltreatment is associated with epigenetic modification of genes involved in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) functioning, which could cause dysregulation of the stress response system. If pervasive, this may be associated with the development of stress-related disorder in adults, including affective disorders, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or borderline-personality disorder (BPD). The majority of studies have focused on DNA methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) and the FKBP5 encoding gene, which regulates the sensitivity of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). How methylation of NR3C1 and FKBP5 interferes with childhood adversity and psychopathology as well as empathy is an under-researched issue. Here, we sought to investigate the association of childhood maltreatment in a sample of 89 individuals (44 healthy participants and 45 patients diagnosed with BPD) with the methylation of the 1 F promoter region of NR3C1 and the intron 7 of FKBP5 as well as with different measures of psychopathology and empathy. Methylation of FKBP5 (bin 2) correlated with anxiety (SCL-90-R) and the global psychopathological symptom load index (GSI), as well as with lower empathic perspective-taking abilities. Psychopathology and empathy impairments correlated with the level of childhood maltreatment. No difference in FKBP5 methylation was observed between the clinical and the non-clinical group. Methylation of NR3C1 was lower in BPD patients compared to controls, yet with small differences. The results are discussed regarding their biological relevance, including possible evolutionary explanations. In short, the regulation of the GR sensitivity by methylation of FKBP5 correlated with psychopathology and empathy scores, while no correlation emerged with the severity of childhood adversity."
https://openalex.org/W3135174692,"Injuries have become devastating and often under-recognized public health concerns. In Canada, injuries are the leading cause of potential years of life lost before the age of 65. The geographical patterns of injury, however, are evident both over space and time, suggesting the possibility of spatial optimization of policies at the neighborhood scale to mitigate injury risk, foster prevention, and control within metropolitan regions. In this paper, Canada’s National Ambulatory Care Reporting System is used to assess unintentional and intentional injuries for Toronto between 2004 and 2010, exploring the spatial relations of injury throughout the city, together with Wellbeing Toronto data. Corroborating with these findings, spatial autocorrelations at global and local levels are performed for the reported over 1.7 million injuries. The sub-categorization for Toronto’s neighborhood further distills the most vulnerable communities throughout the city, registering a robust spatial profile throughout. Individual neighborhoods pave the need for distinct policy profiles for injury prevention. This brings one of the main novelties of this contribution. A comparison of the three regression models is carried out. The findings suggest that the performance of spatial regression models is significantly stronger, showing evidence that spatial regressions should be used for injury research. Wellbeing Toronto data performs reasonably well in assessing unintentional injuries, morbidity, and falls. Less so to understand the dynamics of intentional injuries. The results enable a framework to allow tailor-made injury prevention initiatives at the neighborhood level as a vital source for planning and participatory decision making in the medical field in developed cities such as Toronto."
https://openalex.org/W3135188462,"Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) are a heterogeneous group of bacteria that can exert beneficial effects on plant growth directly or indirectly by different mechanisms. PGPB-based inoculant formulation has been used to replace chemical fertilizers and pesticides. In our previous studies, two endophytic endospore-forming bacteria identified as Bacillus altitudinis were isolated from roots of Ilex paraguariensis St. Hil. seedlings and selected for their plant growth-promoting (PGP) properties shown in vitro and in vivo . The purposes of this work were to assemble the genomes of B . altitudinis 19RS3 and T5S-T4, using different assemblers available for Windows and Linux and to select the best assembly for each strain. Both genomes were also automatically annotated to detect PGP genes and compare sequences with other genomes reported. Library construction and draft genome sequencing were performed by Macrogen services. Raw reads were filtered using the Trimmomatic tool. Genomes were assembled using SPAdes, ABySS, Velvet, and SOAPdenovo2 assemblers for Linux, and Geneious and CLC Genomics Workbench assemblers for Windows. Assembly evaluation was done by the QUAST tool. The parameters evaluated were the number of contigs ≥ 500 bp and ≥ 1000 bp, the length of the longest contig, and the N50 value. For genome annotation PROKKA, RAST, and KAAS tools were used. The best assembly for both genomes was obtained using Velvet. The B . altitudinis 19RS3 genome was assembled into 15 contigs with an N50 value of 1,943,801 bp. The B . altitudinis T5S-T4 genome was assembled into 24 contigs with an N50 of 344,151 bp. Both genomes comprise several genes related to PGP mechanisms, such as those for nitrogen fixation, iron metabolism, phosphate metabolism, and auxin biosynthesis. The results obtained offer the basis for a better understanding of B . altitudinis 19RS3 and T5S-T4 and make them promissory for bioinoculant development."
https://openalex.org/W3135194183,"While the health-related benefits of contraceptive use for women are well documented, potential social benefits, including enabling women’s employment, have not been well researched. We examine the relationship between contraceptive use and women’s employment in India, a country where both factors have remained relatively static over the past ten years. We use data from India’s 2015–16 National Family Health Survey to test the association between current contraceptive use (none, sterilization, IUD, condom, pill, rhythm method or withdrawal) and current employment status (none, professional, clerical or sales, agricultural, services or production) with multivariable, multinomial regression; variable selection was guided by a directed acyclic graph. More than three-quarters of women in this sample were currently using contraception; sterilization was most common. Women who were sterilized or chose traditional contraception, relative to those not using contraception, were more likely to be employed in the agricultural and production sectors, versus not being employed (sterilization adjusted relative risk ratio [aRRR] = 1.5, p&lt;0.001 for both agricultural and production sectors; rhythm aRRR = 1.5, p = 0.01 for agriculture; withdrawal aRRR = 1.5, p = 0.02 for production). In contrast, women with IUDs, compared to those who not using contraception, were more likely to be employed in the professional sector versus not being employed (aRRR = 1.9, p = 0.01). The associations between current contraceptive use and employment were heterogeneous across methods and sectors, though in no case was contraceptive use significantly associated with lower relative probabilities of employment. Policies designed to support women’s access to contraception should consider the sector-specific employment of the populations they target."
https://openalex.org/W3135631184,"The objective of this study was to assess the validity of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire in a cohort of New Zealand children followed from birth to the age of eleven. The study also aimed to assess the stability of the child data in relation to behavioural outcomes during this period.Children in the Auckland Birthweight Collaborative Study were assessed at approximately 3½, 7 and 11 years of age. At all time-points parents completed the parent version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, and the children themselves completed the self-report version at 11 years of age. The validity and internal consistency were assessed using exploratory factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha, and McDonald's Omega. Cross tabulations and Chi-square statistics were used to determine whether Total Difficulty scores, as per accepted cut-offs, remained stable over time (between normal and abnormal/borderline categories).The factor structure remained relatively consistent across all three time-points, though several questions did not load as per the originally published factor analysis at the earliest age. The internal consistency of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was good at all time-points and for parent- and child-completed versions. There was low agreement in the total scores between time points.The factor analysis shows that the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire has a similar factor structure, particularly in older ages, to that previously published and shows good internal consistency. At the pre-school follow up, a larger than expected proportion of children were identified with high scores, particularly in the conduct sub-scale. Children's behaviour changes over time, with only poor to moderate agreement between those identified as abnormal or borderline over the longitudinal follow up."
https://openalex.org/W3133533728,"Background The inland freshwater bodies in the North-Western Province of Sri Lanka have ideal environmental conditions for the Naegleria species. Therefore, the presence and prevalence of Naegleria species in the water bodies of North-Western Province were determined by molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis in this study. Methods A total of 104 water bodies were selected from Kurunegala and Puttalam districts in the North-Western Province of Sri Lanka. Mean turbidity, pH, and temperature were recorded in each water body from three selected site. Centrifuged samples were cultured on non-nutrient agar plates with Escherichia coli . Enflagellation test positive isolates were subjected to DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction using genus and species-specific primers targeting the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and Mp2CL5 gene. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using Bayesian and maximum likelihood (ML) methods. Results The prevalence of Naegleria species and N . fowleri in the study area were 23.07% and 1.92%. The prevalence of Naegleria species and the physicochemical parameters of the water bodies showed no significant correlation. Bayesian analysis of the ITS region revealed the Naegleria Sri Lankan (SL) isolates 1, 3, and 4 in a single clade separated from the 2 and 5. Furthermore, Bayesian analysis identified isolates 2 and 5 in the same clade with Naegleria sp. samples and N . Philippinensis forming a sister clade. However, in the ML tree, all isolates were in the same clade with Naegleria sp. samples and N . Philippinensis . Conclusions The present study reports the first isolation of pathogenic N . fowleri from Sri Lanka. Based on Bayesian analysis, SL isolates 2 and 5 form a separate clade from 1, 3, and 4. However, in ML analysis, all isolates are grouped in one clade with Naegleria sp. samples and N . philippinensis . Further investigations are required to confirm these findings."

https://openalex.org/W3134272795,"The focus of this article is to compare twenty normative and open-access neuroimaging databases based on quantitative measures of image quality, namely, signal-to-noise (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNR). We further the analysis through discussing to what extent these databases can be used for the visualization of deeper regions of the brain, such as the subcortex, as well as provide an overview of the types of inferences that can be drawn. A quantitative comparison of contrasts including T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) images are summarized, providing evidence for the benefit of ultra-high field MRI. Our analysis suggests a decline in SNR in the caudate nuclei with increasing age, in T1w, T2w, qT1 and qT2* contrasts, potentially indicative of complex structural age-dependent changes. A similar decline was found in the corpus callosum of the T1w, qT1 and qT2* contrasts, though this relationship is not as extensive as within the caudate nuclei. These declines were accompanied by a declining CNR over age in all image contrasts. A positive correlation was found between scan time and the estimated SNR as well as a negative correlation between scan time and spatial resolution. Image quality as well as the number and types of contrasts acquired by these databases are important factors to take into account when selecting structural data for reuse. This article highlights the opportunities and pitfalls associated with sampling existing databases, and provides a quantitative backing for their usage."
https://openalex.org/W3133588849,"Purpose Reading comprehension is closely associated with word recognition, particularly at the early stage of reading development. This association is reflected in children with reading difficulties (RD) who demonstrate poor reading comprehension along with delayed word recognition or reduced recognition accuracy. Although the neural mechanisms underlying reading comprehension and word recognition are well studied, few has investigated the white matter (WM) structures that the two processes potentially share. Methods To explore the issue, behavioral scores (word recognition &amp; reading comprehension) and diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) were acquired from Chinese-speaking children with RD and their age-matched typically developing children. WM structures were measured with generalized fractional anisotropy and normalized quantitative anisotropy to optimize fiber tracking precision. Results The children with RD performed significantly poorer than the typically developing children in both behavioral tasks. Between group differences of WM structure were found in the right superior temporal gyrus, the left medial frontal gyrus, the left medial frontal gyrus, and the left caudate body. A significant association between reading comprehension and Chinese character recognition and the DSI indices were found in the corpus callosum. The findings demonstrated the microstructural difference between children with and without reading difficulties go beyond the well-established reading network. Further, the association between the WM integrity of the corpus callosum and the behavioral scores reveals the involvement of the WM structure in both tasks. Conclusion It suggests the two reading-related skills have partially overlapped neural mechanism. Associating the corpus callosum with the reading skills leads to the reconsideration of the right hemisphere role in the typical reading process and, potentially, how it compensates for children with reading difficulties."
https://openalex.org/W3134336673,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is the most intensively investigated receptor tyrosine kinase. Several EGFR mutations and modifications have been shown to lead to abnormal self-activation, which plays a critical role in carcinogenesis. Environmental air pollutants, which are associated with cancer and respiratory diseases, can also activate EGFR. Specifically, the environmental electrophile 1,2-naphthoquinone (1,2-NQ), a component of diesel exhaust particles and particulate matter more generally, has previously been shown to impact EGFR signaling. However, the detailed mechanism of 1,2-NQ function is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that 1,2-NQ is a novel chemical activator of EGFR but not other EGFR family proteins. We found that 1,2-NQ forms a covalent bond, in a reaction referred to as <i>N</i>-arylation, with Lys80, which is in the ligand-binding domain. This modification activates the EGFR–Akt signaling pathway, which inhibits serum deprivation–induced cell death in a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line. Our study reveals a novel mode of EGFR pathway activation and suggests a link between abnormal EGFR activation and environmental pollutant–associated diseases such as cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3134374799,"Postoperative hearing improvement is one of the main expectations for patients receiving tympanoplasty. The capacity to predict postoperative hearing may help to counsel a patient properly and avoid untoward expectations. It is difficult to predict postoperative hearing without knowing the disease process in the middle ear, which can only be assessed intraoperatively. However, the duration and extent of the underlying pathologies may represent in bone-conduction threshold and air-bone gap. Here in patients undergoing tympanoplasty without ossiculoplasty, we sorted and separated the surgery dates into the first group to build the predicting models and the second group to test the predictions. There were 87 and 30 ears, respectively. No specific enrollment or exclusion criteria were based on underlying pathologies such as the perforation size of the tympanic membrane or the middle ear conditions. The results show that bone-conduction threshold and air-bone gap together predicted air-conduction threshold after the surgery, including each frequency of 0.5k, 1k, 2k, and 4k Hz. The discrepancies between the predictions and recordings did not differ among these four frequencies. Of the variance in mean postoperative air-conduction threshold, 56.7% was linearly accounted for by these two preoperative predictors in this sample. The results suggest a trend that, the higher the frequency, the larger the part was accounted for by these two preoperative predictors. These together may help a surgeon to estimate frequency-specific hearing outcome after the surgery, answer patients’ questions with quantitative statistics, and counsel patients with proper expectations."
https://openalex.org/W3135805349,"The Ten Eleven Translocation 1 ( TET1 ) gene encodes an epigenetic modifying molecule that is involved in demethylation of 5-methylcytosine. In hematological malignancies, loss-of-function mutations of TET2 , which is one of the TET family genes including TET1 , are frequently found, while the mutations of TET1 are not. However, clinical studies have revealed that TET1 is highly expressed in some cases of the hematological malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia. Indeed, studies by mouse models using conventional Tet1 knockout mice demonstrated that Tet1 is involved in myeloid leukemogenesis by Mixed Lineage Leukemia ( MLL) fusion gene or TET2 mutant. Meanwhile, the other study showed that Tet1 is highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and that deletion of Tet1 in HSCs enhances potential self-renewal capacity, which is potentially associated with myeloid leukemogenesis. To examine the role of Tet1 in myeloid leukemogenesis more precisely, we generated novel conditional Tet1 -knockout mice, which were used to generate the compound mutant mice by crossing with the inducible MLL-ENL transgenic mice that we developed previously. The leukemic immortalization in vitro was not critically affected by conditional ablation of Tet1 in HSCs with the induced expression of MLL-ENL or in hematopoietic progenitor cells retrovirally transduced with MLL-ENL . In addition, the leukemic phenotypes caused by the induced expression of MLL-ENL in vivo was not also critically affected in the compound mutant mouse model by conditional ablation of Tet1 , although we found that the expression of Evi1 , which is one of critical target genes of MLL fusion gene, in tumor cells was remarkably low under Tet1 -ablated condition. These results revealed that Tet1 was dispensable for the myeloid leukemogenesis by MLL-ENL , suggesting that the therapeutic application of Tet1 inhibition may need careful assessment."
