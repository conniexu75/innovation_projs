https://openalex.org/W1973113504,"Mitochondrial phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK-M), encoded by the nuclear PCK2 gene, links TCA cycle intermediates and glycolytic pools through the conversion of mitochondrial oxaloacetate into phosphoenolpyruvate. In the liver PEPCK-M adjoins its profusely studied cytosolic isoform (PEPCK-C) potentiating gluconeogenesis and TCA flux. However, PEPCK-M is present in a variety of non-gluconeogenic tissues, including tumors of several origins. Despite its potential relevance to cancer metabolism, the mechanisms responsible for PCK2 gene regulation have not been elucidated. The present study demonstrates PEPCK-M overexpression in tumorigenic cells as well as the mechanism for the modulation of PCK2 abundance under several stress conditions. Amino acid limitation and ER stress inducers, conditions that activate the amino acid response (AAR) and the unfolded protein response (UPR), stimulate PCK2 gene transcription. Both the AAR and UPR lead to increased synthesis of ATF4, which mediates PCK2 transcriptional up-regulation through its binding to a putative ATF/CRE composite site within the PCK2 promoter functioning as an amino acid response element. In addition, activation of the GCN2-eIF2α-ATF4 and PERK-eIF2α-ATF4 signaling pathways are responsible for increased PEPCK-M levels. Finally, PEPCK-M knockdown using either siRNA or shRNA were sufficient to reduce MCF7 mammary carcinoma cell growth and increase cell death under glutamine deprivation or ER stress conditions. Our data demonstrate that this enzyme has a critical role in the survival program initiated upon stress and shed light on an unexpected and important role of mitochondrial PEPCK in cancer metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2084439171,"Background When analytical techniques are used to understand and analyse geographical events, adjustments to the datasets (e.g. aggregation, zoning, segmentation etc.) in both the spatial and temporal dimensions are often carried out for various reasons. The ‘Modifiable Areal Unit Problem’ (MAUP), which is a consequence of adjustments in the spatial dimension, has been widely researched. However, its temporal counterpart is generally ignored, especially in space-time analysis. Methods In analogy to MAUP, the Modifiable Temporal Unit Problem (MTUP) is defined as consisting of three temporal effects (aggregation, segmentation and boundary). The effects of MTUP on the detection of space-time clusters of crime datasets of Central London are examined using Space-Time Scan Statistics (STSS). Results and Conclusion The case study reveals that MTUP has significant effects on the space-time clusters detected. The attributes of the clusters, i.e. temporal duration, spatial extent (size) and significance value (p-value), vary as the aggregation, segmentation and boundaries of the datasets change. Aggregation could be used to find the significant clusters much more quickly than at lower scales; segmentation could be used to understand the cyclic patterns of crime types. The consistencies of the clusters appearing at different temporal scales could help in identifying strong or ‘true’ clusters."
https://openalex.org/W2072276134,"Macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1/GDF15) modulates food intake and body weight under physiological and pathological conditions by acting on the hypothalamus and brainstem. When overexpressed in disease, such as in advanced cancer, elevated serum MIC-1/GDF15 levels lead to an anorexia/cachexia syndrome. To gain a better understanding of its actions in the brainstem we studied MIC-1/GDF15 induced neuronal activation identified by induction of Fos protein. Intraperitoneal injection of human MIC-1/GDF15 in mice activated brainstem neurons in the area postrema (AP) and the medial (m) portion of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), which did not stain with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). To determine the importance of these brainstem nuclei in the anorexigenic effect of MIC-1/GDF15, we ablated the AP alone or the AP and the NTS. The latter combined lesion completely reversed the anorexigenic effects of MIC-1/GDF15. Altogether, this study identified neurons in the AP and/or NTS, as being critical for the regulation of food intake and body weight by MIC-1/GDF15."
https://openalex.org/W2127572868,"The present study aimed at investigating the effect of MDMA on measures of empathy and social interaction, and the roles of oxytocin and the 5-HT1A receptor in these effects. The design was placebo-controlled within-subject with 4 treatment conditions: MDMA (75 mg), with or without pindolol (20 mg), oxytocin nasal spray (40 IU+16 IU) or placebo. Participants were 20 healthy poly-drug MDMA users, aged between 18-26 years. Cognitive and emotional empathy were assessed by means of the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and the Multifaceted Empathy Test. Social interaction, defined as trust and reciprocity, was assessed by means of a Trust Game and a Social Ball Tossing Game. Results showed that MDMA selectively affected emotional empathy and left cognitive empathy, trust and reciprocity unaffected. When combined with pindolol, these effects remained unchanged. Oxytocin did not affect measures of empathy and social interaction. Changes in emotional empathy were not related to oxytocin plasma levels. It was concluded that MDMA (75 mg) selectively enhances emotional empathy in humans. While the underlying neurobiological mechanism is still unknown, it is suggested that peripheral oxytocin does not seem to be the main actor in this; potential candidates are the serotonin 2A and the vasopressin 1A receptors. Trial registration: MDMA & PSB NTR 2636."
https://openalex.org/W2067037955,"Cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK), a key player in clathrin-mediated membrane trafficking, is overexpressed in various cancer cells. Here, we report that GAK expression is positively correlated with the Gleason score in surgical specimens from prostate cancer patients. Embryonic fibroblasts from knockout mice expressing a kinase-dead (KD) form of GAK showed constitutive hyper-phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). In addition to the well-known EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib, the dietary flavonoid luteolin was a potent inhibitor of the Ser/Thr kinase activity of GAK in vitro. Co-administration of luteolin and gefitinib to PC-3 cells had a greater effect on cell viability than administration of either compound alone; this decrease in viability was associated with drastic down-regulation of GAK protein expression. A comprehensive microRNA array analysis revealed increased expression of miR-630 and miR-5703 following treatment of PC-3 cells with luteolin and/or gefitinib, and exogenous overexpression of miR-630 caused growth arrest of these cells. GAK appears to be essential for cell death because co-administration of gefitinib and luteolin to EGFR-deficient U2OS osteosarcoma cells also had a greater effect on cell viability than administration of either compound alone. Taken together, these findings suggest that GAK may be a new therapeutic target for prostate cancer and osteosarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2160980311,"Several studies indicated that type 2 diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance are associated with increased colon cancer risk. Recently, studies suggest that metformin can reduce cancer risk in diabetic or non-diabetic patients with unclear mechanisms. This work aimed to determine the effect of metformin on chemically-induced colon cancer in mice. Colon cancer was induced using 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH, 20 mg/kg/week, s.c.) for fifteen weeks. Experiment I: healthy mice were fed with basal diet for four weeks and then allocated into seven groups, (i) saline, (ii) DMH, (iii) oxaliplatin, (iv-v): metformin (100 or 200 mg/kg) and (vi-vii): oxaliplatin+metformin (100 or 200 mg/kg), respectively. Experiment II: type 2 diabetes mellitus was induced by injection of STZ (30 mg/kg) after four weeks of high-fat feeding and then mice were allocated into seven groups similar to those reported in experiment I. Examination of the colonic tissue at the end of the experiment highlighted an increase in angiogenic markers and cell proliferation and showed a greater immunostaining for insulin growth factor I receptors and CD34 in the colon of diabetic mice compared to non-diabetics. In general, metformin downregulated tumor angiogenesis and augmented the antitumor effect of oxaliplatin. Overall, the current results showed that metformin protected against DMH-induced colon cancer in non-diabetic and diabetic mice. This therapeutic effect was, at least in part, attributed to its anti-angiogenic and anti-proliferative mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2059317192,"Group A rotaviruses (RVAs) are the most important etiological agent of acute gastroenteritis in children <5 years of age worldwide. The monovalent rotavirus vaccine Rotarix was introduced into the national Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in Ghana in May 2012. However, there is a paucity of genetic and phylogenetic data on the complete genomes of human RVAs in circulation pre-vaccine introduction. The common bovine rotavirus VP7 genotype G8 has been sporadically detected in Ghanaian children, usually in combination with the VP4 genotype P[6]. To investigate the genomic constellations and phylogeny of RVA strains in circulation prior to vaccine introduction, the full genomes of two unusual G8P[6] strains, GH018-08 and GH019-08, detected during burden of disease surveillance, were characterized by Illumina MiSeq sequencing. The Ghanaian isolates, GH018-08 and GH019-08, exhibited the unusual, previously unreported genotype constellation G8-P[6]-I2-R2-C2-M2-A2-N2-T2-E2-H3. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed that 10 out of the 11 genes of GH018-08 and GH019-08 were identical/nearly identical, with significant variation detected only in their VP1 genes, and clearly established the occurrence of multiple independent interspecies transmission and reassortment events between co-circulating bovine/ovine/caprine rotaviruses and human DS-1-like RVA strains. These findings highlight the contribution of reassortment and interspecies transmission events to the high rotavirus diversity in this region of Africa, and justify the need for simultaneous monitoring of animal and human rotavirus strains."
https://openalex.org/W2079814607,"The correlation of multivariate data is a common task in investigations of soil biology and in ecology in general. Procrustes analysis and the Mantel test are two approaches that often meet this objective and are considered analogous in many situations especially when used as a statistical test to assess the statistical significance between multivariate data tables. Here we call the attention of ecologists to the advantages of a less familiar application of the Procrustean framework, namely the Procrustean association metric (a vector of Procrustean residuals). These residuals represent differences in fit between multivariate data tables regarding homologous observations (e.g., sampling sites) that can be used to estimate local levels of association (e.g., some groups of sites are more similar in their association between biotic and environmental features than other groups of sites). Given that in the Mantel framework, multivariate information is translated into a pairwise distance matrix, we lose the ability to contrast homologous data points across dimensions and data matrices after their fit. In this paper, we attempt to familiarize ecologists with the benefits of using these Procrustean residual differences to further gain insights about the processes underlying the association among multivariate data tables using real and hypothetical examples."
https://openalex.org/W1991740702,"Clinical laboratories are increasingly using molecular tests for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) screening. However, primers have to be targeted to a variable chromosomal region, the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec). We initially screened 726 MRSA isolates from a single UK hospital trust by recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), a novel, isothermal alternative to PCR. Undetected isolates were further characterised using multilocus sequence, spa typing and whole genome sequencing. 96% of our tested phenotypically MRSA isolates contained one of the six orfX-SCCmec junctions our RPA test and commercially available molecular tests target. However 30 isolates could not be detected. Sequencing of 24 of these isolates demonstrated recombinations within the SCCmec element with novel insertions that interfered with the RPA, preventing identification as MRSA. This result suggests that clinical laboratories cannot rely solely upon molecular assays to reliably detect all methicillin-resistance. The presence of significant recombinations in the SCCmec element, where the majority of assays target their primers, suggests that there will continue to be isolates that escape identification. We caution that dependence on amplification-based molecular assays will continue to result in failure to diagnose a small proportion (∼4%) of MRSA isolates, unless the true level of SCCmec natural diversity is determined by whole genome sequencing of a large collection of MRSA isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2171715076,"The mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is a focal species in game management, epidemiology and ornithology, but comparably little research has focused on the ecology of the migration seasons. We studied habitat use, time-budgets, home-range sizes, habitat selection, and movements based on spatial data collected with GPS devices attached to wild mallards trapped at an autumn stopover site in the Northwest European flyway. Sixteen individuals (13 males, 3 females) were followed for 15–38 days in October to December 2010. Forty-nine percent (SD = 8.4%) of the ducks' total time, and 85% of the day-time (SD = 28.3%), was spent at sheltered reefs and bays on the coast. Two ducks used ponds, rather than coast, as day-roosts instead. Mallards spent most of the night (76% of total time, SD = 15.8%) on wetlands, mainly on alvar steppe, or in various flooded areas (e.g. coastal meadows). Crop fields with maize were also selectively utilized. Movements between roosting and foraging areas mainly took place at dawn and dusk, and the home-ranges observed in our study are among the largest ever documented for mallards (mean = 6,859 ha; SD = 5,872 ha). This study provides insights into relatively unknown aspects of mallard ecology. The fact that autumn-staging migratory mallards have a well-developed diel activity pattern tightly linked to the use of specific habitats has implications for wetland management, hunting and conservation, as well as for the epidemiology of diseases shared between wildlife and domestic animals."
https://openalex.org/W1987929298,"Desmoplastic malignancies such as cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) are characterized by a dense stroma containing an abundance of myofibroblasts termed cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF). The CAF phenotype represents an ""activated state"" in which cells are primed for cell death triggered by BH3 mimetics. Accordingly, this primed state may be therapeutically exploited. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying this poorly understood apoptotic priming, we examined the role of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) in CAF priming for cell death given its prominent role in CAF activation. PDGF isomers PDGF-B and PDGF-D are abundantly expressed in CCA cells derived from human specimens. Either isomer sensitizes myofibroblasts to cell death triggered by BH3 mimetics. Similar apoptotic sensitization was observed with co-culture of myofibroblasts and CCA cells. Profiling of Bcl-2 proteins expressed by PDGF-primed myofibroblasts demonstrated an increase in cellular levels of Puma. PDGF-mediated increases in cellular Puma levels induced proapoptotic changes in Bak, which resulted in its binding to Bcl-2. Short hairpin RNA-mediated down-regulation of Puma conferred resistance to PDGF-mediated apoptotic priming. Conversely, the BH3 mimetic navitoclax disrupted Bcl-2/Bak heterodimers, allowing Bak to execute the cell death program. Treatment with a Bcl-2-specific BH3 mimetic, ABT-199, reduced tumor formation and tumor burden in a murine model of cholangiocarcinoma. Collectively, these findings indicate that apoptotic priming of CAF by PDGF occurs via Puma-mediated Bak activation, which can be converted to active full-blown apoptosis by navitoclax or ABT-199 for therapeutic benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2006041371,"Hyaluronan (HA) may have proinflammatory roles in the context of CNS autoimmunity. It accumulates in demyelinated multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, promotes antigen presentation, and enhances T-cell activation and proliferation. HA facilitates lymphocyte binding to vessels and CNS infiltration at the CNS vascular endothelium. Furthermore, HA signals through Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 to stimulate inflammatory gene expression. We assessed the role of HA in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS by administration of 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU), a well established inhibitor of HA synthesis. 4MU decreased hyaluronan synthesis in vitro and in vivo. It was protective in active EAE of C57Bl/6 mice, decreased spinal inflammatory infiltrates and spinal infiltration of Th1 cells, and increased differentiation of regulatory T-cells. In adoptive transfer EAE, feeding of 4MU to donor mice significantly decreased the encephalitogenicity of lymph node cells. The transfer of proteolipid protein (PLP)-stimulated lymph node cells to 4MU-fed mice resulted in a delayed EAE onset and delayed spinal T-cell infiltration. Expression of CXCL12, an anti-inflammatory chemokine, is reduced in MS patients in CSF cells and in spinal cord tissue during EAE. Hyaluronan suppressed production of CXCL12, whereas 4MU increased spinal CXCL12 in naive animals and during neuroinflammation. Neutralization of CXCR4, the most prominent receptor of CXCL12, by administration of AMD3100 diminished the protective impact of 4MU in adoptive transfer EAE. In conclusion, hyaluronan exacerbates CNS autoimmunity, enhances encephalitogenic T-cell responses, and suppresses the protective chemokine CXCL12 in CNS tissue. Inhibition of hyaluronan synthesis with 4MU protects against an animal model of MS and may represent an important therapeutic option in MS and other neuroinflammatory diseases.

The glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA) is ubiquitously present in the pericellular and extracellular matrix of vertebrate tissues. It is produced at the plasma membrane by three hyaluronan synthases (HAS1, -2, and -3) coupling glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine into a linear polymer using the corresponding UDP-sugars as substrates. Hyaluronan is degraded by a family of enzymes called hyaluronidases. In humans, there are at least seven types of hyaluronidase-like enzymes (1.Tesar B.M. Jiang D. Liang J. Palmer S.M. Noble P.W.

Female Dark Agouti (DA) rats, 6–8 weeks old, were purchased from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN) and female SJL/J and C57Bl/6 mice, 6–8 weeks old, from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Animals were housed in the animal facility of Roosevelt Hospital (New York) and were 8–10 weeks old when used for experiments. All procedures were conducted according to the protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Roosevelt Hospital. To determine HA cell culture levels, 100,000 LN18 cells were incubated overnight in a 12-well plate in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Subsequently, cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 2 days in DMEM in the absence of FBS. Varying amounts of 4MU dissolved in DMSO were added to the cultures. The final concentration of DMSO was 0.2%. Hyaluronan was quantified using the Hyaluronan DuoSet (R&D Systems). Blood was collected from rat tail veins. Liver tissue was homogenized by sonication in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The BCA method was used to determine protein concentrations. Hyaluronan was quantified using the Hyaluronan DuoSet (R&D Systems). For active EAE induction, C57Bl/6 mice were immunized with 200 μl of a suspension containing 200 μg of murine myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) peptide (35MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK55, Pepceuticals, UK) and an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant supplemented with 400 μg of H37RA (DIFCO Laboratories, Detroit, MI) by subcutaneous injection.

Ten days later, lymph node and spleen cells were harvested and restimulated in vitro for 4 days with 10 μg/ml PLP peptide. For EAE induction, female SJL/J mice were injected intraperitoneally with 2.5 × 107 preactivated PLP-specific cells. DA rats were immunized subcutaneously at the base of the tail with 65 Ag MOG1–125 emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant containing 400 μg H37Ra in a total volume of 200 μl. Animal weights and clinical scores were recorded routinely by a masked observer (0 = healthy, 1 = limp tail, 2 = partial hind limb weakness and/or ataxia, 3 = complete paralysis of at least one hind limb, 4 = severe forelimb weakness, and 5 = moribund or dead). The mean cumulative score for a treatment group was calculated as the sum of the clinical scores of all animals from day zero until the end of the experiment divided by the number of animals in the respective group. Mice were perfused transcardially with ice-cold saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Spinal cord specimens were coded and cut into three pieces representing the cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral levels. 8-μm paraffin sections were prepared. From each of the three rostrocaudal levels, five coronal sections spaced every 500 μm were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) to assess cellular infiltrates. Thus, 15 tissue sections from each animal were analyzed. Both the total area of each tissue section and the area occupied by inflammatory infiltrates were measured semiautomatically using ImageJ software (ImageJ 1.47e, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (19.Schneider C.A. Rasband W.S. Eliceiri K.W. NIH Image to ImageJ: 25 years of image analysis.Nat. Methods. 2012; 9: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (35376) Google Scholar) by an investigator masked for the clinical results. The percentage of spinal cord with inflammation was calculated as follows: area of the spinal cord infiltrated by inflammatory cells/total spinal cord area of the respective section. Single cell suspensions of cells from inguinal lymph nodes and spinal cords of mice were established. Cells from spinal cord tissue were extracted by using a neural tissue dissociation kit (T) (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany). Cells were restimulated in vitro at a concentration of 106/ml with 100 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin and 1 μl/ml BD GolgiPlug (BD Biosciences) for 4 h. Subsequently, cells were harvested and stained extracellularly with eFluor450 anti-mouse CD4 antibody (Clone RM4-5, eBioscience) and FITC anti-mouse CD25 (clone 7D4, BD Biosciences). Afterward, cells were washed, fixed, permeabilized with the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm kit (BD Biosciences), and stained with a phycoerythrin (PE) anti-mouse IL-17 antibody (Clone eBIO17B7, eBioscience), allophycocyanin (APC) anti-mouse IFNγ (clone XMG1.2, eBioscience), or APC anti-FoxP3 antibody (clone 150D, BioLegend). Flow cytometry analyses were performed to assess the proportions of Treg, Th17, and Th1 cells. After transcardial perfusion with ice-cold saline, mouse spinal cords were isolated and homogenized by sonication. Total protein was extracted with a radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). A rabbit anti-mouse CD3e antibody (ab119332, Abcam) was used to detect CD3 and a rabbit anti-actin antibody (Thermo Scientific) for standardization. The secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) was conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Bands were detected using ECLplus as substrate (Invitrogen), the Kodak Image Station 4000R Pro, and Carestream MI imaging software (Carestream). HEK-BlueTM mTLR2 cells (InvivoGen) were incubated with supernatants from U937 cells that had been incubated for 2 days with 0 or 200 μm 4MU in the presence of HEK-Blue detection medium. A stimulation of Toll-like receptor 2 triggers the expression of the secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase, which results in a blue color development. After 8 h, the development of blue color was assessed using a Synergy HT plate reader (Bio-Tek). 150,000 LN18 cells were cultivated for 24 h in 12-well plates in 1 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells were stimulated with ultra-low molecular weight and high molecular weight hyaluronan (R&D Systems) with LPS (EMD Millipore) or 4MU. 4MU was dissolved in DMSO. The final DMSO cell culture concentration was 0.2%. RNA was isolated by using the RNeasy Plus micro kit (Qiagen) and reversely transcribed into cDNA by using the Sensiscript reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). CXCL12 expression was quantified using human CXCL12-specific TaqMan probes (Hs00171022_m1, Invitrogen) and normalized to respective 18S rRNA quantities also determined by using TaqMan probes. DA rats were perfused with PBS. Total RNA was extracted from spinal cords using the RNeasy lipid tissue midi kit (Qiagen). cDNA was generated using the Sensiscript reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). CXCL12 expression was quantified using rat CXCL12-specific TaqMan probes (Rn00573260_m1, Invitrogen) and normalized to respective actin-b quantities (Rn00667869_m1). Alzet osmotic pumps (Alzet 1004, DURECT Corp.) were used to deliver AMD3100 (Sigma). Filled osmotic pumps were incubated overnight in sterile saline at 37 °C. For pump installation, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (77 mg/kg) and xylazine (15 mg/kg) in saline. The volume and rate of delivery of PBS or AMD3100 by mini-pump were ∼100 nl/h continuously for 28 days. The AMD3100 concentration was 20 mg/ml. Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat 3.0 (SPSS Inc.). Comparisons of groups of normally distributed data were done by Student's t test or one-way ANOVA, respectively. For non-normally distributed data from EAE experiments, a Mann-Whitney rank-sum test was used for comparisons. Error bars represent standard deviation unless indicated otherwise. We used 4MU, a well established and specific inhibitor of hyaluronan production (3.Mummert M.E. Mummert D. Edelbaum D. Hui F. Matsue H. Takashima A.

First, we confirmed the inhibitory influence of 4MU on hyaluronan synthesis by in vitro experiments. 4MU strongly decreased hyaluronan supernatant levels in LN18 astroglioma cell cultures as determined by an ELISA-like hyaluronan assay (Fig. 1A). To modulate hyaluronan synthesis in vivo, 4MU was fed to animals ad libitum mixed within ground chow at a ratio of 5%. To confirm that 4MU reduces hyaluronan synthesis in vivo, it was fed to otherwise naive rats for 4 weeks. Subsequently, the hyaluronan levels in serum and liver protein extracts were quantified (Fig. 1B). 4MU reduced hyaluronan serum levels (13.5 ± 7.5 ng/ml (control) versus 6.2 ± 2.9 ng/ml (4MU)) and hyaluronan liver concentrations (3.9 × 10−6 ± 1.4 × 10−6 g hyaluronan/g protein (control) versus 3.2 × 10−6 ±3.4 × 10−7 g hyaluronan/g protein (4MU)). 4MU becomes glucuronidated, leading to an inhibition of hyaluronan synthesis by depleting UDP-glucuronic acid (14.Kultti A. Pasonen-Seppänen S. Jauhiainen M. Rilla K.J. Kärnä R. Pyöriä E. Tammi R.H. Tammi M.I. 4-Methylumbelliferone inhibits hyaluronan synthesis by depletion of cellular UDP-glucuronic acid and down-regulation of hyaluronan synthase 2 and 3.Exp. Cell Res. 2009; 315: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Most of the 4MU glucuronidation happens in the liver, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract (21.Mulder G.J. Brouwer S. Weitering J.G. Scholtens E. Pang K.S. Glucuronidation and sulfation in the rat in vivo: the role of the liver and the intestine in the in vivo clearance of 4-methylumbelliferone.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1985; 34: 1325-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), making the liver a likely site for observing an impact of 4MU on hyaluronan synthesis. In conclusion, we found significantly reduced levels of hyaluronan in peripheral blood and liver extracts derived from 4MU-fed rats, confirming that 4MU feeding inhibits hyaluronan synthesis in vivo. To investigate the role of hyaluronan in CNS autoimmunity, we examined the impact of 4MU feeding on the active EAE of female C57Bl/6 mice. EAE was induced in female C57Bl/6 mice by MOG peptide (amino acids 35–55) immunization. Animals were fed ad libitum with normal chow or ground chow containing 5% 4MU starting on 1 day before EAE induction. 4MU had a reproducible effect on the clinical disease course of EAE. EAE signs were more severe in control-fed mice (Fig. 2A). Both the average maximal and cumulative scores were lower in mice fed with 4MU than in control mice. In addition, 4MU delayed the onset of EAE disease (Table 1). At day 63 after EAE induction, mice were sacrificed and subsequently analyzed for inflammatory infiltrates, consisting typically of infiltrating mononuclear cells, by H&E staining of spinal cord sections. Inflammatory lesions were detectable in all mice showing clinical signs of EAE. The spinal cord area covered with inflammatory infiltrates was quantified by blinded semiautomatic image analysis and compared between groups based on the percentage of the spinal cord affected by inflammation. Mice fed with 4MU showed significantly less inflammation in spinal cord sections than control animals (Fig. 2B), and the extent of inflammation in individual mice correlated positively with the clinical score at the termination of the experiment (data not shown).TABLE 1Clinical characteristics of active EAE experimentsEAE incidenceMortalityDay of onset ± S.D.Maximal score ± S.D.Cumulative score ± S.D.Active EAE in C57Bl/6 miceaFig. 2A.Control9/10014.6 ± 1.32.9 ± 1.558.3 ± 345% 4MU5/10017.0 ± 1.9**1.4 ± 1.4**14 ± 24**4MU administration starting at dpi 8 in active EAE in C57Bl/6 micebFig. 4.Control10/10012.2 ± 1.82.9 ± 1.532.9 ± 10.85% 4MU10/10017.1 ± 7.0*3.2 ± 1.316.3 ± 16.3*a Fig. 2A.b Fig. 4. Open table in a new tab EAE is an animal model of MS driven by IFNγ-producing Th1 and IL-17a-producing Th17 cells (22.Rostami A. Ciric B. Role of Th17 cells in the pathogenesis of CNS inflammatory demyelination.J. Neurol. Sci. 2013; 333: 76-87Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We addressed the influence of 4MU feeding on generation of Th1 and Th17 cells as well as their infiltration into spinal cord tissue during active MOG peptide EAE in C57Bl/6 mice. Animals were sacrificed on day 20 after active EAE induction, and CD4+ T-cells in inguinal lymph nodes and spinal cord tissue were analyzed by flow cytometry. 4MU did not modulate Th1 but decreased Th17 cell numbers in inguinal lymph nodes, suggesting that 4MU interfered with differentiation or stimulation of encephalitogenic T-cells. On the other hand, 4MU significantly reduced the numbers of Th1 cells in spinal cord tissue (Fig. 2C). In addition, the numbers of CD25hi FoxP3+ regulatory T-cells were slightly increased in inguinal lymph nodes of 4MU-fed mice (Fig. 2D). The percentage of regulatory T-cells in spinal cord tissue was characterized by a high variability and did not differ between control and 4MU-fed mice. To determine whether 4MU affects the differentiation of proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 in vitro, lymph node cells isolated from MOG-immunized C57Bl/6 mice were restimulated in vitro with MOG peptide in the presence or absence of 200 μm 4MU dissolved in DMSO. A 4-day incubation with 4MU resulted in a significant reduction of Th1 cell differentiation, corroborating the anti-inflammatory impact of 4MU on T-cells (Fig. 3A). In non-immunized naive C57Bl/6 mice fed for 7 days with 4MU, we found no difference in the number of Th1 and Th17 cells but a significant increase in the number of regulatory T-cells in inguinal lymph nodes compared with control mice (Fig. 3). In conclusion, the inhibition of hyaluronan synthesis by 4MU decreased the differentiation and CNS infiltration of encephalitogenic T-cells and enhanced the generation of regulatory T-cells. To clarify whether 4MU has any therapeutic efficacy after disease induction, 4MU was administered beginning on day 8 after MOG immunization. 4MU had a fast acting, protective effect on EAE. 4MU-fed mice had significantly lower EAE disease scores between days 12 and 19 (Fig. 4 and Table 1) as well as a significantly delayed disease onset and cumulative disease score at the end of experiment on day 29 (Table 1). Hyaluronan is known to be an important factor in the activation and proliferation of T-cells (2.Bollyky P.L. Evanko S.P. Wu R.P. Potter-Perigo S. Long S.A. Kinsella B. Reijonen H. Guebtner K. Teng B.

https://openalex.org/W2046139839,"Across the globe, species distributions are changing in response to climate change and land use change. In parts of the southeastern United States, climate change is expected to result in the poleward range expansion of black mangroves (Avicennia germinans) at the expense of some salt marsh vegetation. The morphology of A. germinans at its northern range limit is more shrub-like than in tropical climes in part due to the aboveground structural damage and vigorous multi-stem regrowth triggered by extreme winter temperatures. In this study, we developed aboveground allometric equations for freeze-affected black mangroves which can be used to quantify: (1) total aboveground biomass; (2) leaf biomass; (3) stem plus branch biomass; and (4) leaf area. Plant volume (i.e., a combination of crown area and plant height) was selected as the optimal predictor of the four response variables. We expect that our simple measurements and equations can be adapted for use in other mangrove ecosystems located in abiotic settings that result in mangrove individuals with dwarf or shrub-like morphologies including oligotrophic and arid environments. Many important ecological functions and services are affected by changes in coastal wetland plant community structure and productivity including carbon storage, nutrient cycling, coastal protection, recreation, fish and avian habitat, and ecosystem response to sea level rise and extreme climatic events. Coastal scientists in the southeastern United States can use the identified allometric equations, in combination with easily obtained and non-destructive plant volume measurements, to better quantify and monitor ecological change within the dynamic, climate sensitive, and highly-productive mangrove-marsh ecotone."
https://openalex.org/W2028711466,"Background Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a transcriptional co-activator and regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis. We investigated the clinical and biological significance of YAP in endometrial cancer (EMCA). Methods YAP expression in 150 primary tumor tissues from patients with EMCA was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and its association with clinicopathological data was assessed. The biological functions of YAP were determined in EMCA cell lines through knockdown/overexpression of YAP. The role of YAP in modulating radiation sensitivity was also investigated in EMCA cells. Results Increased nuclear YAP expression was significantly associated with higher grade, stage, lympho-vascular space invasion, postoperative recurrence/metastasis and overall survival in estrogen mediated EMCA, called type 1 cancer (p = 0.019, = 0.028, = 0.0008, = 0.046 and = 0.015, respectively). In multivariate analysis, nuclear YAP expression was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival in type 1 EMCA. YAP knockdown by siRNA resulted in a significant decrease in cell proliferation (p<0.05), anchorage-dependent growth (p = 0.015) and migration/invasion (p<0.05), and a significant increase in the number of cells in G0/G1 phase (p = 0.002). Conversely, YAP overexpression promoted cell proliferation. Clonogenic assay demonstrated enhanced radiosensitivity by approximately 36% in YAP inhibited cells. Conclusions Since YAP functions as a transcriptional co-activator, its differential localization in the nucleus of cancer cells and subsequent impact on cell proliferation could have important consequences with respect to its role as an oncogene in EMCA. Nuclear YAP expression could be useful as a prognostic indicator or therapeutic target and predict radiation sensitivity in patients with EMCA."
https://openalex.org/W1972882966,"Macrophage phagocytosis plays an important role in host defense. The molecular mechanism, especially factors regulating the phagocytosis, however, is not completely understood. In the present study, we found that response gene to complement 32 (RGC-32) is an important regulator of phagocytosis. Although RGC-32 is induced and abundantly expressed in macrophage during monocyte-macrophage differentiation, RGC-32 appears not to be important for this process because RGC-32-deficient bone marrow progenitor can normally differentiate to macrophage. However, both peritoneal macrophages and bone marrow-derived macrophages with RGC-32 deficiency exhibit significant defects in phagocytosis, whereas RGC-32-overexpressed macrophages show increased phagocytosis. Mechanistically, RGC-32 is recruited to macrophage membrane where it promotes F-actin assembly and the formation of phagocytic cups. RGC-32 knock-out impairs F-actin assembly. RGC-32 appears to interact with PKC to regulate PKC-induced phosphorylation of F-actin cross-linking protein myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time that RGC-32 is a novel membrane regulator for macrophage phagocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2108444096,"Facing a customer market with rising demands for cloud service dependability and security, trustworthiness evaluation techniques are becoming essential to cloud service selection. But these methods are out of the reach to most customers as they require considerable expertise. Additionally, since the cloud service evaluation is often a costly and time-consuming process, it is not practical to measure trustworthy attributes of all candidates for each customer. Many existing models cannot easily deal with cloud services which have very few historical records. In this paper, we propose a novel service selection approach in which the missing value prediction and the multi-attribute trustworthiness evaluation are commonly taken into account. By simply collecting limited historical records, the current approach is able to support the personalized trustworthy service selection. The experimental results also show that our approach performs much better than other competing ones with respect to the customer preference and expectation in trustworthiness assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2099423734,"Background Infection-related exacerbations of respiratory diseases are a major health concern; thus understanding the mechanisms driving them is of paramount importance. Despite distinct inflammatory profiles and pathological differences, asthma and COPD share a common clinical facet: raised airway ATP levels. Furthermore, evidence is growing to suggest that infective agents can cause the release of extracellular vesicle (EVs) in vitro and in bodily fluids. ATP can evoke the P2X7/caspase 1 dependent release of IL-1β/IL-18 from EVs; these cytokines are associated with neutrophilia and are increased during exacerbations. Thus we hypothesized that respiratory infections causes the release of EVs in the airway and that the raised ATP levels, present in respiratory disease, triggers the release of IL-1β/IL-18, neutrophilia and subsequent disease exacerbations. Methods To begin to test this hypothesis we utilised human cell-based assays, ex vivo murine BALF, in vivo pre-clinical models and human samples to test this hypothesis. Results Data showed that in a murine model of COPD, known to have increased airway ATP levels, infective challenge causes exacerbated inflammation. Using cell-based systems, murine models and samples collected from challenged healthy subjects, we showed that infection can trigger the release of EVs. When exposed to ATP the EVs release IL-1β/IL-18 via a P2X7/caspase-dependent mechanism. Furthermore ATP challenge can cause a P2X7 dependent increase in LPS-driven neutrophilia. Conclusions This preliminary data suggests a possible mechanism for how infections could exacerbate respiratory diseases and may highlight a possible signalling pathway for drug discovery efforts in this area."
https://openalex.org/W2093206483,"Interleukin (IL)-6 signals via a receptor complex composed of the signal-transducing β-receptor gp130 and the non-signaling membrane-bound or soluble IL-6 receptor α (IL-6R, sIL-6R), which is referred to as classic and trans-signaling, respectively. IL-6 trans-signaling is functionally associated with the development of chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer. Soluble gp130 (sgp130) variants are natural inhibitors of trans-signaling. Differential splicing yields sgp130 isoforms. Here, we describe that alternative intronic polyadenylation in intron 10 of the gp130 transcript results in a novel mRNA coding for an sgp130 protein isoform (sgp130-E10) of 70-80 kDa. The sgp130-E10 protein was expressed in vivo in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. To assess the biological activity of sgp130-E10, we expressed this variant as Fc-tagged fusion protein (sgp130-E10Fc). Recombinant sgp130-E10Fc binds to a complex of IL-6 and sIL-6R, but not to IL-6 alone, and specifically inhibits IL-6 trans-signaling. Thus, it might play an important role in the regulation of trans-signaling in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2161457385,"The spatial and temporal distribution of forage quality is among the most central factors affecting herbivore habitat selection. Yet, for high latitude areas, forage quantity has been found to be more important than quality. Studies on large ungulate foraging patterns are faced with methodological challenges in both assessing animal movements at the scale of forage distribution, and in assessing forage quality with relevant metrics. Here we use first-passage time analyses to assess how reindeer movements relate to forage quality and quantity measured as the phenology and cover of growth forms along reindeer tracks. The study was conducted in a high latitude ecosystem dominated by low-palatable growth forms. We found that the scale of reindeer movement was season dependent, with more extensive area use as the summer season advanced. Small-scale movement in the early season was related to selection for younger stages of phenology and for higher abundances of generally phenologically advanced palatable growth forms (grasses and deciduous shrubs). Also there was a clear selection for later phenological stages of the most dominant, yet generally phenologically slow and low-palatable growth form (evergreen shrubs). As the summer season advanced only quantity was important, with selection for higher quantities of one palatable growth form and avoidance of a low palatable growth form. We conclude that both forage quality and quantity are significant predictors to habitat selection by a large herbivore at high latitude. The early season selectivity reflected that among dominating low palatability growth forms there were palatable phenological stages and palatable growth forms available, causing herbivores to be selective in their habitat use. The diminishing selectivity and the increasing scale of movement as the season developed suggest a response by reindeer to homogenized forage availability of low quality."
https://openalex.org/W2076987661,"The serotonin transporter (SERT) plays a critical role in regulating serotonin signaling by mediating reuptake of serotonin from the extracellular space. The molecular and cellular mechanisms controlling SERT levels in the membrane remain poorly understood. To study trafficking of the surface resident SERT, two functional epitope-tagged variants were generated. Fusion of a FLAG-tagged one-transmembrane segment protein Tac to the SERT N terminus generated a transporter with an extracellular epitope suited for trafficking studies (TacSERT). Likewise, a construct with an extracellular antibody epitope was generated by introducing an HA (hemagglutinin) tag in the extracellular loop 2 of SERT (HA-SERT). By using TacSERT and HA-SERT in antibody-based internalization assays, we show that SERT undergoes constitutive internalization in a dynamin-dependent manner. Confocal images of constitutively internalized SERT demonstrated that SERT primarily co-localized with the late endosomal/lysosomal marker Rab7, whereas little co-localization was observed with the Rab11, a marker of the “long loop” recycling pathway. This sorting pattern was distinct from that of a prototypical recycling membrane protein, the β2-adrenergic receptor. Furthermore, internalized SERT co-localized with the lysosomal marker LysoTracker and not with transferrin. The sorting pattern was further confirmed by visualizing internalization of SERT using the fluorescent cocaine analog JHC1-64 and by reversible and pulse-chase biotinylation assays showing evidence for lysosomal degradation of the internalized transporter. Finally, we found that SERT internalized in response to stimulation with 12-myristate 13-acetate co-localized primarily with Rab7- and LysoTracker-positive compartments.

https://openalex.org/W2090287336,"Estrogen is implicated as an important factor in stimulating breast cancer cell proliferation, and presence of estrogen receptor (ER) is an indication of a good prognosis in breast cancer patients. Mcl-1 is an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member that is often over expressed in breast tumors, correlating with poor survival. In breast cancer, it was been previously shown that epidermal growth factor receptors up-regulate Mcl-1 but the role of estrogen in increasing Mcl-1 expression was unknown. In ERα positive cell lines MCF-7 and ZR-75, estrogen treatment increased Mcl-1 expression at both the protein and mRNA level. In two ERα negative cell lines, SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-231, estrogen failed to increase in Mcl-1 protein expression. We found that ERα antagonists decreased estrogen mediated Mcl-1 expression at both the protein and mRNA level. Upon knockdown of ERα, Mcl-1 mRNA expression after estrogen treatment was also decreased. We also found that ERα binds to the Mcl-1 promoter at a region upstream of the translation start site containing a half ERE site. Streptavidin-pull down assay showed that both ERα and transcription factor Sp1 bind to this region. These results suggest that estrogen is involved in regulating Mcl-1 expression specifically through a mechanism involving ERα."
https://openalex.org/W2151571031,"We report a novel algorithm, iBLUP, to impute missing genotypes by simultaneously and comprehensively using identity by descent and linkage disequilibrium information. The simulation studies showed that the algorithm exhibited drastically tolerance to high missing rate, especially for rare variants than other common imputation methods, e.g. BEAGLE and fastPHASE. At a missing rate of 70%, the accuracy of BEAGLE and fastPHASE dropped to 0.82 and 0.74 respectively while iBLUP retained an accuracy of 0.95. For minor allele, the accuracy of BEAGLE and fastPHASE decreased to −0.1 and 0.03, while iBLUP still had an accuracy of 0.61.We implemented the algorithm in a publicly available software package also named iBLUP. The application of iBLUP for processing real sequencing data in an outbred pig population was demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2111162523,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia affecting the elderly. Neurodegeneration is caused by the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide which is generated from the sequential proteolytic cleavage of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by the β- and γ- secretases. Previous reports revealed that the 37 kDa/67 kDa laminin receptor (LRP/LR) is involved in APP processing, however, the exact mechanism by which this occurs remains largely unclear. This study sought to assess whether LRP/LR interacted with APP, β- or γ-secretase. Detailed confocal microscopy revealed that LRP/LR showed a strong co-localisation with APP, β- and γ-secretase, respectively, at various sub-cellular locations. Superresolution Structured Illumination Microscopy (SR-SIM) showed that interactions were unlikely between LRP/LR and APP and β-secretase, respectively, while there was strong co-localisation between LRP/LR and γ-secretase at this 80 nm resolution. FRET was further employed to assess the possibility of protein-protein interactions and only an interaction between LRP/LR and γ-secretase was found. FLAG co-immunoprecipitation confirmed these findings as LRP/LR co-immunoprecipitated with γ-secretase, but failed to do so with APP. These findings indicate that LRP/LR exerts its influence on Aβ shedding via a direct interaction with the γ-secretase and possibly an indirect interaction with the β-secretase."
https://openalex.org/W2033594658,"Selenium (Se) is an element that in trace quantities is both essential in mammals but also toxic to bacteria, yeast, plants and animals, including C. elegans. Our previous studies showed that selenite was four times as toxic as selenate to C. elegans, but that deletion of thioredoxin reductase did not modulate Se toxicity. To characterize Se regulation of the full transcriptome, we conducted a microarray study in C. elegans cultured in axenic media supplemented with 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mM Se as selenite. C. elegans cultured in 0.2 and 0.4 mM Se displayed a significant delay in growth as compared to 0, 0.05, or 0.1 mM Se, indicating Se-induced toxicity, so worms were staged to mid-L4 larval stage for these studies. Relative to 0.1 mM Se treatment, culturing C. elegans at these Se concentrations resulted in 1.9, 9.7, 5.5, and 2.3%, respectively, of the transcriptome being altered by at least 2-fold. This toxicity altered the expression of 295 overlapping transcripts, which when filtered against gene sets for sulfur and cadmium toxicity, identified a dataset of 182 toxic-Se specific genes that were significantly enriched in functions related to oxidoreductase activity, and significantly depleted in genes related to structural components of collagen and the cuticle. Worms cultured in low Se (0 mM Se) exhibited no signs of deficiency, but low Se was accompanied by a transcriptional response of 59 genes changed ≥2-fold when compared to all other Se concentrations, perhaps due to decreases in Se-dependent TRXR-1 activity. Overall, these results suggest that Se toxicity in C. elegans causes an increase in ROS and stress responses, marked by increased expression of oxidoreductases and reduced expression of cuticle-associated genes, which together underlie the impaired growth observed in these studies."
https://openalex.org/W2128423304,"Liver X receptors (LXRs) have been recognized as a promising therapeutic target for atherosclerosis; however, their role in insulin sensitivity is controversial. Adiponectin plays a unique role in maintaining insulin sensitivity. Currently, no systematic experiments elucidating the role of LXR activation in insulin function based on adiponectin signaling have been reported. Here, we investigated the role of LXR activation in insulin resistance based on adiponectin signaling, and possible mechanisms. C57BL/6 mice maintained on a regular chow received the LXR agonist, T0901317 (30 mg/kg.d) for 3 weeks by intraperitoneal injection, and differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with T0901317 or GW3965. T0901317 treatment induced significant insulin resistance in C57BL/6 mice. It decreased adiponectin gene transcription in epididymal fat, as well as serum adiponectin levels. Activity of AMPK, a key mediator of adiponectin signaling, was also decreased, resulting in decreased Glut-4 membrane translocation in epididymal fat. In contrast, adiponectin activity was not changed in the liver of T0901317 treated mice. In vitro, both T0901317 and GW3965 decreased adiponectin expression in adipocytes in a dose-dependent manner, an effect which was diminished by LXRα silencing. ChIP-qPCR studies demonstrated that T0901317 decreased the binding of PPARγ to the PPAR-responsive element (PPRE) of the adiponectin promoter in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, T0901317 exerted an antagonistic effect on the expression of adiponectin in adipocytes co-treated with 3 µM Pioglitazone. In luciferase reporter gene assays, T0901317 dose-dependently inhibited PPRE-Luc activity in HEK293 cells co-transfected with LXRα and PPARγ. These results suggest that LXR activation induces insulin resistance with decreased adiponectin signaling in epididymal fat, probably due to negative regulation of PPARγ signaling. These findings indicate that the potential of LXR activation as a therapeutic target for atherosclerosis may be limited by the possibility of exacerbating insulin resistance-related disease."
https://openalex.org/W1964731656,"During mitosis large alterations in cellular structures occur rapidly, which to a large extent is regulated by post-translational modification of proteins. Modification of proteins with the small ubiquitin-related protein SUMO2/3 regulates mitotic progression, but few mitotic targets have been identified so far. To deepen our understanding of SUMO2/3 during this window of the cell cycle, we undertook a comprehensive proteomic characterization of SUMO2/3 modified proteins in mitosis and upon mitotic exit. We developed an efficient tandem affinity purification strategy of SUMO2/3 modified proteins from mitotic cells. Combining this purification strategy with cell synchronization procedures and quantitative mass spectrometry allowed for the mapping of numerous novel targets and their dynamics as cells progressed out of mitosis. This identified RhoGDIα as a major SUMO2/3 modified protein, specifically during mitosis, mediated by the SUMO ligases PIAS2 and PIAS3. Our data provide a rich resource for further exploring the role of SUMO2/3 modifications in mitosis and cell cycle regulation."

In particular, the effects of switchgrass particle size (32-200) on each pretreatment regime are examined. Physical properties of untreated and pretreated samples are characterized using crystallinity, surface accessibility measurements and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging. At every particle size tested, ionic liquid (IL) pretreatment results in greater cell wall disruption, reduced crystallinity, increased accessible surface area, and higher saccharification efficiencies compared with dilute acid and AFEX pretreatments. The advantages of using IL pretreatment are greatest at larger particle sizes (>75 µm)."
https://openalex.org/W2136214528,"GABAA receptors distributed in somatodendritic compartments play critical roles in regulating neuronal activities, including spike timing and firing pattern; however, the properties and functions of GABAA receptors at the axon are still poorly understood. By recording from the cut end (bleb) of the main axon trunk of layer –5 pyramidal neurons in prefrontal cortical slices, we found that currents evoked by GABA iontophoresis could be blocked by picrotoxin, indicating the expression of GABAA receptors in axons. Stationary noise analysis revealed that single-channel properties of axonal GABAA receptors were similar to those of somatic receptors. Perforated patch recording with gramicidin revealed that the reversal potential of the GABA response was more negative than the resting membrane potential at the axon trunk, suggesting that GABA may hyperpolarize the axonal membrane potential. Further experiments demonstrated that the activation of axonal GABAA receptors regulated the amplitude and duration of action potentials (APs) and decreased the AP-induced Ca2+ transients at the axon. Together, our results indicate that the waveform of axonal APs and the downstream Ca2+ signals are modulated by axonal GABAA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2331954842,"Thyroid hormone (TH) exerts its effects by binding to the thyroid hormone receptor (TR), which binds to TH response elements (TREs) to regulate target gene expression. We investigated the relative ability of liganded homodimers TR and retinoid X receptor (RXR), and the heterodimer TR/RXR, to regulate gene expression for the TRE half-site organizations: direct repeat 4 (DR4), inverted repeat 0 (IR0) and everted repeat 6 (ER6). Luciferase reporter assays using a DR4 TRE suggest that both the TR homodimer and TR/RXR heterodimer regulate luciferase expression in the presence of their respective ligands. However, in the presence of the IR0 TRE, transfection with TR/RXR and RXR alone increased luciferase activity and there was no effect of TR alone. The presence of 9-cis-retinoic acid was necessary for luciferase expression, whereas TH treatment alone was insufficient. For the ER6 TRE, transfection with TR/RXR, TR alone and RXR alone (in the presence of their respective ligands) all caused a significant increase in luciferase activity. When both ligands were present, transfection with both TR/RXR caused more activation. Finally, we investigated the efficacy of the TR-antagonist 1-850 in inhibiting transcription by TR or TR/RXR at DR4 and ER6 TREs. We found that 1-850 did not suppress luciferase activation in the presence of TR/RXR for the ER6 TRE, suggesting conformational changes of the ligand binding domain of the TR when bound to different TRE half-site organizations. Collectively, the findings indicate that there are fundamental differences between TRE configurations that affect nuclear receptor interactions with the response element and ability to bind ligands and antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W1980906460,"Wild aquatic birds, reservoir of low-pathogenicity (LP) avian influenza viruses (AIVs), congregate in huge numbers in Western Siberia wetlands, where major intra- and inter-continental bird flyways overlap. In 2005 and 2006, highly pathogenic (HP) AIV H5N1 epizootics affected wild and domestic birds in the Novosibirsk Region. In 2012, we evaluated AIV persistence in Siberian natural and anthropic ecosystems.In Novosibirsk Region, 166 wild birds ecologically linked to aquatic environments and 152 domestic waterfowl were examined for AIV isolation in embryonating chicken eggs. Biological samples were obtained by integrating the conventional cloacal swab collection with the harvesting of samples from birds' plumage. Haemagglutinating allantoic fluids were further characterized by serological and molecular methods. In August-September 2012, 17 AIVs, including three H3N8, eight H4N6, two H4N?, one H2N?, one H?N2, and two unsubtyped LPAIVs, were isolated from 15 wild ducks. Whereas comparable proportions of wild Anseriformes (n.118) tested virus isolation (VI)-positive from cloaca and feathers (5.9% vs 8.5%) were detected, the overall prevalence of virus isolation, obtained from both sampling methods, was 2.4 times higher than that calculated on results from cloacal swab examination only (14.4% vs 5.9%). Unlike previously described in this area, the H4N6 antigenic subtype was found to be the prevalent one in 2012. Both cloacal and feather samples collected from domestic waterfowl tested VI-negative.We found lack of evidence for the H5N1 HPAIV circulation, explainable by the poor environmental fitness of HPAIVs in natural ecosystems. Our LPAIV isolation data emphasise the importance of Siberia wetlands in influenza A virus ecology, providing evidence of changes in circulation dynamics of HN antigenic subtypes harboured in wild bird reservoirs. Further studies of isolates, based on bioinformatic approaches to virus molecular evolution and phylogenesis, will be needed to better elucidate mechanisms involved in AIV perpetuation in this area."
https://openalex.org/W2018058321,"Prions are transmissible, propagating alternative states of proteins. Prions in budding yeast propagate heritable phenotypes and can function in large-scale gene regulation, or in some cases occur as diseases of yeast. Other ‘prionogenic’ proteins are likely prions that have been determined experimentally to form amyloid in vivo, and to have prion-like domains that are able to propagate heritable states. Furthermore, there are over 300 additional ‘prion-like’ yeast proteins that have similar amino-acid composition to prions (primarily a bias for asparagines and glutamines). Here, we examine the protein functional and interaction networks that involve prion, prionogenic and prion-like proteins. Set against a marked overall preference for N/Q-rich prion-like proteins not to interact with each other, we observe a significant tendency of prion/prionogenic proteins to interact with other, N/Q-rich prion-like proteins. This tendency is mostly due to a small number of networks involving the proteins NUP100p, LSM4p and PUB1p. In general, different data analyses of functional and interaction networks converge to indicate a strong linkage of prionogenic and prion-like proteins, to stress-granule assembly and related biological processes. These results further elucidate how prions may impact gene regulation, and reveal a broader horizon for the functional relevance of N/Q-rich prion-like domains."
https://openalex.org/W2062776922,"A critical part of generating robust chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data is the optimization of chromatin purification and size selection. This is particularly important when ChIP is combined with next-generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify targets of DNA-binding proteins, genome-wide. Current protocols refined by the ENCODE consortium generally use a two-step cell lysis procedure that is applicable to a wide variety of cell types. However, the isolation and size selection of chromatin from primary human epithelial cells may often be particularly challenging. These cells tend to form sheets of formaldehyde cross-linked material in which cells are resistant to membrane lysis, nuclei are not released and subsequent sonication produces extensive high molecular weight contamination. Here we describe an optimized protocol to prepare high quality ChIP-grade chromatin from primary human bronchial epithelial cells. The ENCODE protocol was used as a starting point to which we added the following key steps to separate the sheets of formaldehyde-fixed cells prior to lysis. (1) Incubation of the formaldehyde-fixed adherent cells in Trypsin-EDTA (0.25% room temperature) for no longer than 5 min. (2) Equilibration of the fixed cells in detergent-free lysis buffers prior to each lysis step. (3) The addition of 0.5% Triton X-100 to the complete cell membrane lysis buffer. (4) Passing the cell suspension (in complete cell membrane lysis buffer) through a 25-gauge needle followed by continuous agitation on ice for 35 min. Each step of the modified protocol was documented by light microscopy using the Methyl Green-Pyronin dual dye, which stains cytoplasm red (Pyronin) and the nuclei grey-blue (Methyl green). This modified method is reproducibly effective at producing high quality sheared chromatin for ChIP and is equally applicable to other epithelial cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2076723453,"Complex networks have recently become the focus of research in many fields. Their structure reveals crucial information for the nodes, how they connect and share information. In our work we analyze protein interaction networks as complex networks for their functional modular structure and later use that information in the functional annotation of proteins within the network. We propose several graph representations for the protein interaction network, each having different level of complexity and inclusion of the annotation information within the graph. We aim to explore what the benefits and the drawbacks of these proposed graphs are, when they are used in the function prediction process via clustering methods. For making this cluster based prediction, we adopt well established approaches for cluster detection in complex networks using most recent representative algorithms that have been proven as efficient in the task at hand. The experiments are performed using a purified and reliable Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein interaction network, which is then used to generate the different graph representations. Each of the graph representations is later analysed in combination with each of the clustering algorithms, which have been possibly modified and implemented to fit the specific graph. We evaluate results in regards of biological validity and function prediction performance. Our results indicate that the novel ways of presenting the complex graph improve the prediction process, although the computational complexity should be taken into account when deciding on a particular approach."

Multivariate logistic regression incorporated socio-demographic background, household characteristics, health status, behaviors, and perceptions of influenza and vaccination.We completed interviews with 1,954 respondents. Among those, 548 (28.0%) received the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 vaccination, and 469 (24.0%) intended to get the next seasonal influenza vaccine. Receipt of the H1N1 vaccine was more prevalent among schoolchildren, the elderly, those who had contact with more people in their daily lives, and those who had received influenza vaccinations in previous years. In comparison, the intention to receive the next seasonal influenza vaccine tended to be stronger among children, the elderly, and those who reported less healthy status or lived with children, who received a seasonal influenza vaccination before, and who worried more about a possible new pandemic.Children, the elderly, and those who had gotten seasonal flu shots before in Taiwan were more likely to both receive a pandemic H1N1 vaccination and intend to receive a seasonal influenza vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W1976752451,"It is widely believed that language function tends to show little age-related performance decline. Indeed, some older individuals seem to use compensatory mechanisms to maintain a high level of performance when submitted to lexical tasks. However, how these mechanisms affect cortical and subcortical activity during semantic and phonological processing has not been extensively explored. The purpose of this study was to look at the effect of healthy aging on cortico-subcortical routes related to semantic and phonological processing using a lexical analogue of the Wisconsin Cart-Sorting Task. Our results indicate that while young adults tend to show increased activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the fusiform gyrus, the ventral temporal lobe and the caudate nucleus during semantic decisions and in the posterior Broca's area (area 44), the temporal lobe (area 37), the temporoparietal junction (area 40) and the motor cortical regions during phonological decisions, older individuals showed increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and motor cortical regions during both semantic and phonological decisions. Furthermore, when semantic and phonological decisions were contrasted with each other, younger individuals showed significant brain activity differences in several regions while older individuals did not. Therefore, in older individuals, the semantic and phonological routes seem to merge into a single pathway. These findings represent most probably neural reserve/compensation mechanisms, characterized by a decrease in specificity, on which the elderly rely to maintain an adequate level of performance."
https://openalex.org/W2074659749,"Canine aggression is one of the most frequent problems in veterinary behavioral medicine, which in severe cases may result in relinquishment or euthanasia. As it is important to reveal underlying factors of aggression for both treatment and prevention, we recently developed a questionnaire on aggression and temperamental traits and found that “reactivity to stimuli” was associated with aggression toward owners, children, strangers, and other dogs of the Shiba Inu breed. In order to examine whether these associations were consistent in other breeds, we asked the owners of insured dogs of Anicom Insurance Inc. to complete our questionnaire. The top 17 contracted breeds were included. The questionnaire consisted of dogs' general information, four items related to aggression toward owners, children, strangers, and other dogs, and 20 other behavioral items. Aggression-related and behavioral items were rated on a five-point frequency scale. Valid responses (n = 5610) from owners of dogs aged 1 through 10 years were collected. Factor analyses on 18 behavioral items (response rate over 95%) extracted five largely consistent factors in 14 breeds: “sociability with humans,” “fear of sounds,” “chase proneness,” “reactivity to stimuli,” and “avoidance of aversive events.” By stepwise multiple regression analyses, using the Schwartz's Bayesian information criterion (BIC) method with aggression points as objective variables and general information and temperamental factor points as explanatory variables, “reactivity to stimuli,” i.e., physical reactivity to sudden movement or sound at home, was shown to be significantly associated with owner-directed aggression in 13 breeds, child-directed aggression in eight breeds, stranger-directed aggression in nine breeds, and dog-directed aggression in five breeds. These results suggest that “reactivity to stimuli” is simultaneously involved in several types of aggression. Therefore, it would be worth taking “reactivity to stimuli” into account in the treatment and prevention of canine aggression."

The role of ABCG1 in atherosclerosis remains controversial, especially in animal models. Our previous study showed that single nucleotide polymorphism rs57137919 (-367G>A) in the ABCG1 promoter region was associated with reduced risk for atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD). This study was designed to provide functional evidence for the role of rs57137919G>A in atherosclerosis in humans. We combined in vitro and ex vivo studies using cell lines and human monocyte-derived macrophages to investigate the functional consequences of the promoter polymorphism by observing the effects of the rs57137919A allele on promoter activity, transcription factor binding, gene expression, cholesterol efflux, and apoptosis levels. The results showed that the rs57137919A allele was significantly associated with decreased ABCG1 gene expression possibly due to the impaired ability of protein-DNA binding. ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux decreased by 23% with rs57137919 A/A versus the G/G genotype. Cholesterol-loaded macrophage apoptosis was induced 2-fold with the A/A genotype compared with the G/G genotype. Proapoptotic genes Bok and Bid mRNA levels were significantly increased in macrophages from the A/A genotype compared with those from the G/G genotype. These findings demonstrated that the ABCG1 promoter rs57137919G>A variant had an allele-specific effect on ABCG1 expression and was associated with an increased apoptosis in cholesterol-loaded macrophages, providing functional evidence to explain the reduced risk for atherosclerosis in subjects with the ABCG1 promoter rs57137919A allele as reported in our previous study."
https://openalex.org/W2075696813,"The Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infects the human population and maintains latency stage of viral life cycle in a variety of cell types including cells of epithelial, mesenchymal and endothelial origin. The establishment of latent infection by KSHV requires the expression of an unique repertoire of genes among which latency associated nuclear antigen (LANA) plays a critical role in the replication of the viral genome. LANA regulates the transcription of a number of viral and cellular genes essential for the survival of the virus in the host cell. The present study demonstrates the disruption of the host G2/M cell cycle checkpoint regulation as an associated function of LANA. DNA profile of LANA expressing human B-cells demonstrated the ability of this nuclear antigen in relieving the drug (Nocodazole) induced G2/M checkpoint arrest. Caffeine suppressed nocodazole induced G2/M arrest indicating involvement of the ATM/ATR. Notably, we have also shown the direct interaction of LANA with Chk2, the ATM/ATR signalling effector and is responsible for the release of the G2/M cell cycle block."

Using the CT Perfusion (CTP) functional imaging, we sought to investigate the interaction between CI and the Aβ protein on cerebral hemodynamics. Methods A previously established rat model of CI and Aβ was used for the CTP study. Iodinated contrast was given intravenously, while serial CT images of sixteen axial slices were acquired. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) and blood volume (CBV) parametric maps were co-registered to a rat brain atlas and regions of interest were drawn on the maps. Microvascular alteration was investigated with histopathology. Results CTP results revealed that ipsilateral striatum of Aβ+CI and CI groups showed significantly lower CBF and CBV than control at the acute phase. Striatal CBF and CBV increased significantly at week 1 in the CI and Aβ+CI groups, but not in the Aβ alone or control group. Histopathology showed that average density of dilated microvessels in the ipsilateral striatum in CI and Aβ+CI groups was significantly higher than control at week 1, indicating this could be associated with hyperperfusion and hypervolemia observed from CTP results. Conclusion These results demonstrate that CTP can quantitatively measure the hemodynamic disturbance on CBF and CBV functional maps in a rat model of CI interacting with Aβ."
https://openalex.org/W2160801328,"Though the Y-chromosome O2a-M95 lineage is one of the major haplogroups present in eastern Asian populations, especially among Austro-Asiatic speaking populations from Southwestern China and mainland Southeast Asia, to date its phylogeny lacks structure due to only one downstream SNP marker (M88) assigned to the lineage. A recent array-capture-based Y chromosome sequencing of Asian samples has yielded a variety of novel SNPs purportedly belonging to the O2a-M95 lineage, but their phylogenetic positions have yet to be determined. In this study, we sampled 646 unrelated males from 22 Austro-Asiatic speaking populations from Cambodia, Thailand and Southwestern China, and genotyped 12 SNP makers among the sampled populations, including 10 of the newly reported markers. Among the 646 males, 343 belonged to the O2a-M95 lineage, confirming the supposed dominance of this Y chromosome lineage in Austro-Asiatic speaking populations. We further characterized the phylogeny of O2a-M95 by defining 5 sub-branches: O2a1*-M95, O2a1a-F789, O2a1b*-F1252, O2a1b1*-M88 and O2a1b1a -F761. This updated phylogeny not only improves the resolution of this lineage, but also allows for greater tracing of the prehistory of human populations in eastern Asia and the Pacific, which may yield novel insights into the patterns of language diversification and population movement in these regions."
https://openalex.org/W2008216027,"The plastids of chlorarachniophytes were derived from an ancestral green alga via secondary endosymbiosis. Thus, genes from the “green” lineage via secondary endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) are expected in the nuclear genomes of the Chlorarachniophyta. However, several recent studies have revealed the presence of “red” genes in their nuclear genomes. To elucidate the origin of such “red” genes in chlorarachniophyte nuclear genomes, we carried out exhaustive single-gene phylogenetic analyses, including two operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that represent two divergent sister lineages of the Chlorarachniophyta, Amorphochlora amoeboformis ( = Lotharella amoeboformis; based on RNA sequences newly determined here) and Bigelowiella natans (based on the published genome sequence). We identified 10 genes of cyanobacterial origin, phylogenetic analysis of which showed the chlorarachniophytes to branch with the red lineage (red algae and/or red algal secondary or tertiary plastid-containing eukaryotes). Of the 10 genes, 7 demonstrated robust monophyly of the two chlorarachniophyte OTUs. Thus, the common ancestor of the extant chlorarachniophytes likely experienced multiple horizontal gene transfers from the red lineage. Because 4 of the 10 genes are obviously photosynthesis- and/or plastid-related, and almost all of the eukaryotic OTUs in the 10 trees possess plastids, such red genes most likely originated directly from photosynthetic eukaryotes. This situation could be explained by a possible cryptic endosymbiosis of a red algal plastid before the secondary endosymbiosis of the green algal plastid, or a long-term feeding on a single (or multiple closely related) red algal plastid-containing eukaryote(s) after the green secondary endosymbiosis."

We included 2064 PC in this study. Of the sampled PC patients, 1207 received treatment with GnRH agonists. We individually traced each PC patient for a 1-year period to identify those who were hospitalized with pneumonia. We performed a Cox proportional hazard regression to explore the association between the use of GnRH agonists and the risk of pneumonia during the 1-year follow-up period.Incidence rates of pneumonia during the 1-year follow-up period were 4.35 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.89∼9.64) per 100 person-years and 2.14 (95% CI: 1.31∼3.32) per 100 person-years for PC patients who did and those who did not receive treatment with GnRH agonists, respectively. The log-rank test suggested that there was a significant difference in the 1-year pneumonia-free survival rate between PC patients who did and those who did not receive treatment with GnRH agonists (p<0.002). After adjusting for age, monthly income, and the Charlson Comorbidities Index score, PC patients who received treatment with GnRH agonists were more likely to have been hospitalized for pneumonia during the 1-year follow-up period than PC patients who did not receive treatment with GnRH agonists (hazard ratio: 1.92, 95% CI: 1.10∼3.36).PC patients who received treatment with GnRH agonists had an increased risk of pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W2092962995,"Insulin-mimetic species of low molecular weight are speculated to mediate some intracellular insulin actions. These inositol glycans, which are generated upon insulin stimulation from glycosylphosphatidylinositols, might control the activity of a multitude of insulin effector enzymes. Acylated inositol glycans (AIGs) are generated by cleavage of protein-free GPI precursors through the action of GPI-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLC) and D (GPI-PLD). We synthesized AIGs (IG-1, IG-2, IG-13, IG-14, and IG-15) and then evaluated their insulin-mimicking bioactivities. IG-1 significantly stimulated glycogen synthesis and lipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and rat isolated adipocytes dose-dependently. IG-2 significantly stimulated lipogenesis in rat isolated adipocytes dose-dependently. IG-15 also enhanced glycogen synthesis and lipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The administration of IG-1 decreased plasma glucose, increased glycogen content in liver and skeletal muscles and improved glucose tolerance in C57B6N mice with normal diets. The administration of IG-1 decreased plasma glucose in STZ-diabetic C57B6N mice. The treatment of IG-1 decreased plasma glucose, increased glycogen content in liver and skeletal muscles and improved glucose tolerance in C57B6N mice with high fat-diets and db/db mice. The long-term treatment of IG-1 decreased plasma glucose and reduced food intake and body weight in C57B6N mice with high fat-diets and ob/ob mice. Thus, IG-1 has insulin-mimicking bioactivities and improves glucose tolerance in mice models of diabetes with or without obesity."
https://openalex.org/W1976199261,"Cardiac development is a complex, multiscale process encompassing cell fate adoption, differentiation and morphogenesis. To elucidate pathways underlying this process, a recently developed algorithm to reverse engineer gene regulatory networks was applied to time-course microarray data obtained from the developing mouse heart. Approximately 200 genes of interest were input into the algorithm to generate putative network topologies that are capable of explaining the experimental data via model simulation. To cull specious network interactions, thousands of putative networks are merged and filtered to generate scale-free, hierarchical networks that are statistically significant and biologically relevant. The networks are validated with known gene interactions and used to predict regulatory pathways important for the developing mammalian heart. Area under the precision-recall curve and receiver operator characteristic curve are 9% and 58%, respectively. Of the top 10 ranked predicted interactions, 4 have already been validated. The algorithm is further tested using a network enriched with known interactions and another depleted of them. The inferred networks contained more interactions for the enriched network versus the depleted network. In all test cases, maximum performance of the algorithm was achieved when the purely data-driven method of network inference was combined with a data-independent, functional-based association method. Lastly, the network generated from the list of approximately 200 genes of interest was expanded using gene-profile uniqueness metrics to include approximately 900 additional known mouse genes and to form the most likely cardiogenic gene regulatory network. The resultant network supports known regulatory interactions and contains several novel cardiogenic regulatory interactions. The method outlined herein provides an informative approach to network inference and leads to clear testable hypotheses related to gene regulation."

Here, we developed a high throughput screening method to identify novel substrates for caspase-3 in a neuronal cell line. Critical steps in our strategy consist of two-dimensional electrophoresis-based protein separation and in vitro caspase-3 incubation of immobilized proteins to sort out direct substrates. Among 46 putative substrates identified in MN9D neuronal cells, we further evaluated whether caspase-3-mediated cleavage of anamorsin, a recently recognized cell death-defying factor in hematopoiesis, is a general feature of apoptosis. In vitro and cell-based cleavage assays indicated that anamorsin was specifically cleaved by caspase-3 but not by other caspases, generating 25- and 10-kDa fragments. Thus, in apoptosis of neuronal and non-neuronal cells induced by various stimuli including staurosporine, etoposide, or 6-hydroxydopamine, the cleavage of anamorsin was found to be blocked in the presence of caspase inhibitor. Among four tetrapeptide consensus DXXD motifs existing in anamorsin, we mapped a specific cleavage site for caspase-3 at DSVD209↓L. Intriguingly, the 25-kDa cleaved fragment of anamorsin was also detected in post-mortem brains of Alzheimer and Parkinson disease patients. Although the RNA interference-mediated knockdown of anamorsin rendered neuronal cells more vulnerable to staurosporine treatment, reintroduction of full-length anamorsin into an anamorsin knock-out stromal cell line made cells resistant to staurosporine-induced caspase activation, indicating the antiapoptotic function of anamorsin. Taken together, our approach seems to be effective to identify novel substrates for caspases and has the potential to provide meaningful insights into newly identified substrates involved in neurodegenerative processes.

Apoptosis is an active cell death process that occurs in development, homeostasis, and pathologic conditions of multicellular organisms (1.Thompson C.B. Apoptosis in the pathogenesis and treatment of disease.Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6186) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is controlled by a diverse range of internal and external signals encompassing hormone, growth factor, death ligands, reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, and hypoxia. Caspases, highly conserved cysteine-aspartate proteases, play an essential role in the transduction of apoptotic signaling pathways (2.Degterev A. Boyce M. Yuan J. A decade of caspases.Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8543-8567Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). There are two types of caspases: initiator caspases and effector caspases. Whereas initiator caspases specifically cleave proforms of inactive effector caspases, thereby activating them, effector caspases cleave cellular substrates, catalyzing diverse sets of biological phenomena (3.Crawford E.D. Wells J.A. Caspase substrates and cellular remodeling.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 1055-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). For example, changes such as DNA fragmentation (4.Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. A caspase-activated DNase that degrades DNA during apoptosis, and its inhibitor ICAD.Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar) and membrane blebbing (5.Coleman M.L.

To delineate the apoptotic pathway, the identification of caspase substrates is of great interest. To date, ∼1000 human protein substrates have been reported to be cleaved by caspases (7.Lüthi A.U.

Numerous studies have used gel-based high throughput technologies or gel-free proteomics in conjunction with mass spectrometry to identify putative caspase substrates in large scale (3.Crawford E.D. Wells J.A. Caspase substrates and cellular remodeling.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 1055-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In these methods, analytical specimens are prepared in two different ways. In the first approach, cells are challenged to induce caspase activation (a forward approach), and in the second approach, cellular lysates from non-treated cells are incubated with a caspase of interest (a reverse approach). Considering the numbers of identified substrates (ranging from tens to over a few hundreds), both the forward and reverse approaches seem to be effective to identify putative caspase substrates in high throughput in diverse cell types. However, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the resulting cleavage products are not direct substrates of caspases but may be generated as a consequence of sequential or combinatorial action of caspases with other proteases that are activated downstream or upstream of caspases.

U.S.A. 2000; 97: 2875-2880Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), few attempts have been systematically made to identify potentially neuronal cell type-specific caspase substrates and/or disease progression-related caspase substrates. We therefore attempted to develop a novel high throughput substrate screening method to find caspase-3 substrates that are potentially related to neurodegenerative diseases. To identify substrates directly cleaved by caspase-3, we developed a gel-based protease proteomic approach in which proteins on immobilized isoelectric focusing (IEF) strips were incubated with exogenously added recombinant caspase-3. With this method, we identified 46 putative caspase-3 substrates in MN9D neuronal cells. Among the putative substrates identified, we further characterized anamorsin as a novel caspase-3 substrate and mapped its cleavage site sequence at DSVD209↓L. Intriguingly, caspase-3-mediated cleavage of anamorsin was detected in experimental models of neurodegeneration as well as in post-mortem brains of AD and PD patients. The study using anamorsin knock-out (KO) fetal liver stromal cells overexpressing the full-length anamorsin or either of two fragments indicated that full-length anamorsin may act as a novel antiapoptotic protein in the central nervous system, and its caspase-3-mediated cleavage may represent a loss-of-function phenotype. In sum, the present study suggests that our approach is effective to identify novel caspase-3 substrates and its associated cellular function in neurodegeneration.

U-2 OS cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultivated in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Invitrogen) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For drug treatments, MN9D cells or U-2 OS cells were treated for the indicated time periods with 100 μm 6-hydroxydopamine (Sigma), 50 μm 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+; Sigma), or 1 μm staurosporine in N2 serum-free medium or 50 μm etoposide (Sigma) in DMEM. In some cases, cells were co-treated with 100 μm N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk; MP Biomedicals, Eschwege, Germany). Fetal liver stromal cell lines were prepared as described previously (22.Maeda K. Yasumoto S. Tsuruda A. Andoh K. Kai K. Otoi T. Matsumura T.

Anim. 2007; 43: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, fetal liver stromal cells derived from wild-type or anamorsin-deficient E14.5 murine embryos were inoculated onto 0.1% gelatin-coated plastic dishes and allowed to proliferate for 2 days. Cell lines were established by transfection with an expression plasmid encoding simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen to the primary fetal liver stromal cells and then cloned by limiting dilution. Each cloned cell line was named as either FW (wild-type anamorsin) or FK (anamorsin-deficient). Cell lines were propagated over 30 times by splitting them 1:3. MN9D cells and mouse fetal liver cells were transiently transfected with the indicated vectors encoding FLAG- or V5-tagged wild-type or mutant anamorsin using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, MN9D cells or mouse fetal liver cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells or 5 × 105 cells on P-100 culture dishes, respectively. One day after plating, transfection was performed with 24 μg of vectors for MN9D cells or 10 μg of vectors for mouse fetal liver cells. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were used for experiments. The rate of cell survival was determined by the colorimetric measurement using the MTT reduction assay (24.Choi W.S. Lee E.H.

Briefly, dissociated cells were plated onto 6- or 24-well culture plates coated with 50 μg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and 1 μg/ml laminin (Invitrogen). Cultures were cultivated at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator in DMEM supplemented with 2 mm glutamine (Sigma), 5% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), and 5% horse serum (Invitrogen). Three days after plating, 10 μm cytosine arabinoside was added to halt the growth of non-neuronal dividing cells. Cultures were used for experiments at 7 days in vitro. Under these culture conditions, more than 95% of cells were neurons. For transduction into primary cultures of cortical neurons, lentiviral vectors (in pLKO.1) containing anamorsin shRNA sequences (1, TRCN0000191007: CCGGCTTGAGTATTTATGCTGAGTACTCGAGTACTCAGCATAAATACTCAAGTTTTTTG; 2, TRCN0000189757: CCGGGACAAGTCATCTCCTGAGGAACTCGAGTTCCTCAGGAGATGACTTGTCTTTTTTG) and non-target shRNA control vector (shScrambled; SHC016) were purchased from Sigma. The lentivirus particles were generated by co-transfection of HEK293T cell with the above mentioned lentiviral vectors and three plasmids (pMDLg/pRRE, pMD2.G, and pRSV-Rev; all from Addgene). Lipofectamine 2000 was used for transfection as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, culture media were filtered using a 0.45-μm filter (Millipore). Primary cultures of cortical neurons at 7 days in vitro were exposed to lentiviral particles and incubated for an additional 4 days. Cultures were then treated with or without 200 nm staurosporine for 24 h. Anti-cell death effects of anamorsin were determined by immunoblot analysis for the cleaved caspase-3 and the MTT reduction assay. For the MTT reduction assay, cells cultured in 24-well culture plates and exposed to drug were subjected to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml MTT solution. Viability was expressed as a percentage over the untreated matched control cells (100%). Two-dimensional electrophoresis was carried out as described previously with some modifications (21.Lee Y.M. Park S.H. Shin D.I. Hwang J.Y. Park B. Park Y.J. Lee T.H. Chae H.Z. Jin B.K. Oh T.H. Oh Y.J.

All chemicals used for two-dimensional electrophoresis were purchased from Sigma unless stated otherwise. Briefly, MN9D cells were solubilized in a 1× sample buffer containing 5 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 0.25% Tween 20, 100 mm DTT, 10% isopropanol, 12.5% water-saturated butanol, 5% glycerol, and 1% immobilized pH gradient buffer (pH 4–7 linear Immobiline DryStrip, GE Healthcare). Protein concentrations of samples were measured by a 2D Quant kit (GE Healthcare) as recommended by the manufacturer. Prior to IEF, Immobiline DryStrips (24 cm, pI 4–7 linear; GE Healthcare) were rehydrated in a sample buffer containing 1.5 mg of cellular lysates. The gels were run for a total of 100 kV-h using progressively increasing voltage on an Ettan IPGphor (GE Healthcare). After IEF, the strips were washed three times with distilled water and then incubated with or without 25 μg of recombinant human caspase-3 in 5 ml of caspase-3 activation buffer (100 mm HEPES, 4 m NaCl, 0.5 m EDTA, 0.5 m EGTA, 2 m MgCl2). Recombinant human caspase-3 was prepared and purified as basically described by us (25.Karki P. Seong C. Kim J.E. Hur K. Shin S.Y. Lee J.S. Cho B. Park I.S.

Prior to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), the strips were washed three times with distilled water followed by an equilibration step. SDS-PAGE was performed on an 8–18% gradient gel in an Ettan Dalt II System (GE Healthcare). Gels were then stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. The stained gels were scanned using a densitometer (Powerlook 2100XL, UMAX), and the gel images were analyzed by using the ProteomWeaver software system (Bio-Rad). For in-gel digestion, the protein spots of interest were manually excised from the two-dimensional electrophoresis gels. Gel slices were washed with a buffer containing 25 mm NH4HCO3 and 50% acetonitrile, dried completely using a SpeedVac evaporator (BioTron, Seoul, Korea), and digested with 10 μg/ml trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) in 25 mm NH4HCO3 at 37 °C for 18 h. After peptides were solubilized with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), the peptide mixtures were desalted using a home-made column packed with C18 porus beads (Invitrogen). Subsequently, the bound peptides were eluted in 0.6 μl of elution buffer (1 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution in 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA) and spotted onto a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) plate (Invitrogen). MALDI time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectra were acquired on a 4700 Proteomics Analyzer (Invitrogen). The peptide masses were matched with the theoretical peptide masses of all proteins from all species using the NCBI or Swiss-Prot database. Human anamorsin cDNA (BC002568) was purchased from ImaGenes (Berlin, Germany). Using this plasmid as a template, FLAG-tagged human anamorsin (wild type), N-terminal fragment (NT; amino acids 1–211), and C-terminal fragment (CT; amino acids 212–312) were generated by a standard PCR method with the primers 5′-CTCTCGAGATGGACTATAAGGACGATGATGACAAGATGGCAGATTTTGGG-3′ and 5′-CCTCTAGACTAGGCATCATGAAGATTGCTATC-3′ (wild type (WT)), 5′-CTCTCGAGATGGACTATAAGGACGATGATGACAAGATGGCAGATTTTGGG-3′ and 5′-CCTCTAGACTAATCCATGCTGTCGTCCTCC-3′ (NT), and 5′-CTCTCGAGATGGACTATAAGGACGATGATGACAAGCTCATTGACTCAGATG-3′ and 5′-CCTCTAGACTAGGCATCATGAAGATTGCTATC-3′ (CT) and subcloned into the pCI-Neo vector (Promega). V5-tagged mouse anamorsin was amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-CCGGTACCATGGAGGAGTTTGGGATC-3′ and 5′-CCTCTAGAGGCATCCTGGAGATTGCTATTG-3′ and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His A type vector (Invitrogen). The pcDNA3.1/V5-His A vectors containing calponin-3, emerin, thymidylate synthase, or TDP43 were purchased from Cosmogenetech (Seoul, Korea). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Based on search results for putative caspase-3 cleavage sites, pcDNA3.1/V5-His A vectors encoding D205A, D209A, D212A, or D221A anamorsin point mutant were made with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following primer sets: 5′-CTCAGCAAATGACATGGAGGCTGACAGTGTGGATCTCATTG-3′ and 5′-CAATGAGATCCACACTGTCAGCCTCCATGTCATTTGCTGAG-3′ (D205A), 5′-GGAGGATGACAGTGTGGCTCTCATTGACTCAGACG-3′ and 5′-CGTCTGAGTCAATGAGAGCCACACTGTCATCCTCC-3′ (D209A), 5′-CAGTGTGGATCTCATTGCCTCAGACGAGCTGCTTG-3′ and 5′-CAAGCAGCTCGTCTGAGGCAATGAGATCCACACTG-3′ (D212A), and 5′-GCTGCTTGATCCAGAGGCTTTGAAGAGGCCTGACC-3′ and 5′-GGTCAGGCCTCTTCAAAGCCTCTGGATCAAGCAGC-3′ (D221A). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. pRNAT-U6.1/Neo vector containing shRNA sequence against anamorsin was purchase from GenScript (Piscataway, NJ). The shRNA sequence against anamorsin is 5′-GGATCCCGGATGACAGTGTGGATCTCATTTGATATCCGATGAGATCCACACTGTCATCCTTTTTTCCAAAAGCTT-3′. pRNAT-U6.1/Neo vector containing shRNA sequence against firefly luciferase was used as control shRNA. The shRNA sequence against firefly luciferase is 5′-GGATCCCGCTTACGCTGAGTACTTCGATTGATATCCGTCGAAGTACTCAGCGTAAGTTTTTCCAAAAGCTT-3′. For in vitro caspase-3 cleavage assays, vectors harboring the indicated sequences were transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by using the TNT coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting reactant (9 μl) was incubated with 50 ng of recombinant caspase-3 in the presence or absence of 50 μm Z-VAD-fmk (a pan-caspase inhibitor) in 20 μl of caspase reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.2) for 1.5 h at 37 °C (28.Green K.A.

To examine the specificity of caspase-3-mediated cleavage, the metabolically labeled mouse anamorsin wild type was incubated with 50 ng of recombinant human caspase-2, -7, and -8 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or recombinant human caspase-6 and -9 (Enzo Life Sciences, Plymouth Meeting, PA). Reactions were stopped by adding 5 μl of 5× sample buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm dithiothreitol, 10% SDS, 0.5% bromphenol blue, 50% glycerol, pH 6.8) followed by boiling for 5 min. Subsequently, reactants were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography. Rat monoclonal anti-anamorsin antibody (KM3052; 1:30,000) recognizing the N-terminal region of anamorsin was used as reported previously by us (29.Shibayama H. Takai E. Matsumura I. Kouno M. Morii E.

Primary antibodies used were HRP-conjugated anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma; 1:5000), anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen; 1:5000), and anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA; 1:1000). Anti-GAPDH antibody (Millipore, Billerica, MA; 1:5000) and anti-actin antibody (Sigma; 1:5000) were used as loading controls. Following drug treatment, cells were lysed, and the resulting cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot analyses as described previously (30.Yun N. Kim C. Cha H. Park W.J. Shibayama H. Park I.S. Oh Y.J. Caspase-3-mediated cleavage of PICOT in apoptosis.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2013; 432: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with chilled PBS containing 2 mm EDTA and lysed on ice in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, 1.0% Triton X-100) with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Subsequently, cell lysates were homogenized using a 1-ml syringe with a 26-gauge needle attached. Protein contents were measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. An equal amount of soluble proteins was separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto prewetted PVDF membranes, and processed for immunoblot analysis as we described previously (31.Choi W.S. Eom D.S. Han B.S.

The HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; 1:5000). Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to detect specific bands. The relative band intensity was measured using ImageJ imaging software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Autopsy brain tissue from the cortex of nine neuropathologically confirmed AD cases and four age-matched cases with no AD changes or any other neurodegenerative condition were provided by Boston University Alzheimer's Disease Center (Dr. Ann C. McKee). Tissue lysates of these post-mortem brains were obtained from Dr. Gwag at Ajou University (32.Kang H.J. Yoon W.J. Moon G.J. Kim D.Y. Sohn S. Kwon H.J. Gwag B.J.

Successful interventions to change sharing behavior will require understanding people’s motives and purposes for sharing medicines. Better information about how medicines fit into the gifting and reciprocity system could be useful in designing interventions to modify medicine sharing behavior. However, it is uncertain how people situate medicines among other items that might be shared. This investigation is a descriptive study of how people sort medicines and other shareable items. Methods and Findings This study in the Dominican Republic examined how a convenience sample (31 people) sorted medicines and rated their shareability in relation to other common household items. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling to produce association maps in which the distances between items offer a visual representation of the collective opinion of the participants regarding the relationships among the items. In addition, from a pile sort constrained by four categories of whether sharing or loaning the item was acceptable (on a scale from not shareable to very shareable), we assessed the degree to which the participants rated the medicines as shareable compared to other items. Participants consistently grouped medicines together in all pile sort activities; yet, medicines were mixed with other items when rated by their candidacy to be shared. Compared to the other items, participants had more variability of opinion as to whether medicines should be shared. Conclusions People think of medicines as a distinct group, suggesting that interventions might be designed to apply to medicines as a group. People’s differing opinions as to whether it was appropriate to share medicines imply a degree of uncertainty or ambiguity that health promotion interventions might exploit to alter attitudes and behaviors. These findings have implications for the design of health promotion interventions to impact medicine sharing behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2061976892,"In multicellular organisms metabolism is distributed across different organs, each of which has specific requirements to perform its own specialized task. But different organs also have to support the metabolic homeostasis of the organism as a whole by interorgan metabolite transport. Recent studies have successfully reconstructed global metabolic networks in tissues and cell types and attempts have been made to connect organs with interorgan metabolite transport. Instead of these complicated approaches to reconstruct global metabolic networks, we proposed in this study a novel approach to study interorgan metabolite transport focusing on transport processes mediated by solute carrier (Slc) transporters and their couplings to cognate enzymatic reactions. We developed a computational approach to identify and score potential interorgan metabolite transports based on the integration of metabolism and transports in different organs in the adult mouse from quantitative gene expression data. This allowed us to computationally estimate the connectivity between 17 mouse organs via metabolite transport. Finally, by applying our method to circadian metabolism, we showed that our approach can shed new light on the current understanding of interorgan metabolite transport at a whole-body level in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1964739908,"The bilin-binding proteins (BBP) from lepidopteran insects are members of the lipocalin family of proteins and play a special role in pigmentation through the binding of biliverdin IXγ. Lopap, a BBP-like protein from the venom of the toxic caterpillar Lonomia obliqua has been reported to act as a serine protease that activates the coagulation proenzyme prothrombin. Here we show that BBPLo, a variant of lopap from the same organism binds biliverdin IXγ, forming a complex that is spectrally identical with previously described BBP proteins. Although BBPLo is nearly identical in sequence to lopap, no prothrombinase activity was detected in our recombinant preparations using reconstituted systems containing coagulation factors Xa and Va, as well as anionic phospholipids. In addition to biliverdin, BBPLo was found to form a 1∶1 complex with heme prompting us to examine whether the unusual biliverdin IXγ ligand of BBPs forms as a result of oxidation of bound heme in situ rather than by a conventional heme oxygenase. Using ascorbate or a NADPH+-ferredoxin reductase-ferredoxin system as a source of reducing equivalents, spectral changes are seen that suggest an initial reduction of heme to the Fe(II) state and formation of an oxyferrous complex. The complex then disappears and a product identified as a 5-coordinate carbonyl complex of verdoheme, an intermediate in the biosynthesis of biliverdin, is formed. However, further reaction to form biliverdin was not observed, making it unlikely that biliverdin IXγ is formed by this pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2081682219,"If memory depends on changes in synaptic strength, then manipulation of synaptic strength after learning should alter memory for what was learned. Here, we examined whether high frequency stimulation of the perforant path in vivo disrupts memory for a previously-learned hidden platform location in the Morris water task as well as whether this effect is modulated by memory strength or memory reactivation. We found that high frequency stimulation affected probe test performance regardless of memory strength or state of memory activation, although the precise nature of this effect differed depending on whether rats received minimal or extensive training prior to high frequency stimulation. These findings suggest that artificial manipulation of synaptic strength between the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus may destabilize memory for a previously-learned spatial location."
