https://openalex.org/W2021044098,"Scott Jackson, Jeremy Schmutz, Phillip McClean and colleagues report the genome sequence of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and resequenced wild individuals and landraces from Mesoamerican and Andean gene pools, showing that common bean underwent two independent domestications. Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is the most important grain legume for human consumption and has a role in sustainable agriculture owing to its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. We assembled 473 Mb of the 587-Mb genome and genetically anchored 98% of this sequence in 11 chromosome-scale pseudomolecules. We compared the genome for the common bean against the soybean genome to find changes in soybean resulting from polyploidy. Using resequencing of 60 wild individuals and 100 landraces from the genetically differentiated Mesoamerican and Andean gene pools, we confirmed 2 independent domestications from genetic pools that diverged before human colonization. Less than 10% of the 74 Mb of sequence putatively involved in domestication was shared by the two domestication events. We identified a set of genes linked with increased leaf and seed size and combined these results with quantitative trait locus data from Mesoamerican cultivars. Genes affected by domestication may be useful for genomics-enabled crop improvement."

Although a cold environment is the physiologic stimulus for inducing beige fat in mice and humans, the events that lead from the sensing of cold to the development of beige fat remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the efferent beige fat thermogenic circuit, consisting of eosinophils, type 2 cytokines interleukin (IL)-4/13, and alternatively activated macrophages. Genetic loss of eosinophils or IL-4/13 signaling impairs cold-induced biogenesis of beige fat. Mechanistically, macrophages recruited to cold-stressed subcutaneous white adipose tissue (scWAT) undergo alternative activation to induce tyrosine hydroxylase expression and catecholamine production, factors required for browning of scWAT. Conversely, administration of IL-4 to thermoneutral mice increases beige fat mass and thermogenic capacity to ameliorate pre-established obesity. Together, our findings have uncovered the efferent circuit controlling biogenesis of beige fat and provide support for its targeting to treat obesity.

Obesity, which affects 1.4 billion adults globally, represents the greatest current threat to human health (Finucane et al., 2011Finucane M.M. Stevens G.A. Cowan M.J. Danaei G. Lin J.K. Paciorek C.J.

Chronic imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure causes obesity for which there is no effective therapy (Harms and Seale, 2013Harms M. Seale P.

Thus, a major challenge for biomedical sciences is to identify targetable pathways that can decrease energy intake or increase energy expenditure. One of the most promising targets for treatment of human obesity is brown adipose tissue (BAT) (Enerbäck, 2010Enerbäck S. Human brown adipose tissue.Cell Metab. 2010; 11: 248-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, Harms and Seale, 2013Harms M. Seale P. Brown and beige fat: development, function and therapeutic potential.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 1252-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar), but adult humans lack this thermogenic interscapular organ (Lidell et al., 2013Lidell M.E. Betz M.J. Dahlqvist Leinhard O.

However, recent studies have demonstrated that adult humans harbor a separate depot of brown adipocytes that are cold inducible and interspersed among white adipocytes in the supraclavicular, para-aortic, and suprarenal regions (Cypess et al., 2009Cypess A.M.

Cohen P. Spiegelman B.M. Adaptive thermogenesis in adipocytes: is beige the new brown?.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 234-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), there is great clinical interest in the therapeutic targeting of beige fat for the treatment of obesity (Enerbäck, 2010Enerbäck S.

However, our lack of understanding of how cold triggers the development of functional beige fat is a major barrier for its therapeutic translation. Uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1), which dissipates the mitochondrial electrochemical gradient to stimulate cellular respiration, mediates the thermogenic activity of both brown and beige adipocytes (Cannon and Nedergaard, 2010Cannon B.

Despite this similarity in thermogenesis, multiple lines of evidence indicate that brown and beige adipocytes have unique expression profiles that likely contribute to their tissue-specific functions (Harms and Seale, 2013Harms M. Seale P. Brown and beige fat: development, function and therapeutic potential.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 1252-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar). First, unlike interscapular brown adipocytes that arise from Myf5+/Pax7+ myogenic precursors (Lepper and Fan, 2010Lepper C. Fan C.M.

USA. 2007; 104: 4401-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), beige adipocytes residing in the scWAT of mice do not have a history of Myf5+ expression (Seale et al., 2011Seale P. Conroe H.M.

Invest. 2011; 121: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Second, brown adipocytes constitutively express Ucp1 after differentiation, whereas beige adipocytes specifically increase expression of Ucp1 in response to environmental cold, and agonists of the β-adrenergic receptor or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (Ppar-γ) (Liu et al., 2013Liu W.

Third, a number of genes, such as Klhl13, Ear2, Tbx1, Tmem26, and CD137, are preferentially expressed in beige adipocyte precursors (Liu et al., 2013Liu W. Shan T. Yang X. Liang S. Zhang P. Liu Y.

Together, these findings suggest that beige and brown adipocytes are likely to have complementary functions in the maintenance of energy balance and thermogenesis; however, rigorous proof for the therapeutic efficacy of beige fat in the treatment of obesity is lacking. In the textbook view of thermogenesis, the sensing of cold by the neuronal system triggers the sympathetic efferents that promote the biogenesis and activation of brown fat (Cannon and Nedergaard, 2011Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Nonshivering thermogenesis and its adequate measurement in metabolic studies.J. Exp. Biol. 2011; 214: 242-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, Lowell and Spiegelman, 2000Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. Towards a molecular understanding of adaptive thermogenesis.Nature. 2000; 404: 652-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Although this model works well for tissues that are densely innervated by the sympathetic nerves (Morrison and Nakamura, 2011Morrison S.F. Nakamura K. Central neural pathways for thermoregulation.Front Biosci (Landmark Ed). 2011; 16: 74-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar), such as the interscapular BAT, it does not explain how cold exposure results in the rapid remodeling of the poorly innervated scWAT (Daniel and Derry, 1969Daniel H. Derry D.M. Criteria for differentiation of brown and white fat in the rat.Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1969; 47: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, Slavin and Ballard, 1978Slavin B.G. Ballard K.W. Morphological studies on the adrenergic innervation of white adipose tissue.Anat. Rec. 1978; 191: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, Trayhurn and Ashwell, 1987Trayhurn P. Ashwell M. Control of white and brown adipose tissues by the autonomic nervous system.Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1987; 46: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In these classic studies, adrenergic nerves only innervated 2%–3% of all adipocytes in WAT, leading these authors to conclude that the sympathetic nerves primarily innervate blood vessels of the WAT (Daniel and Derry, 1969Daniel H. Derry D.M. Criteria for differentiation of brown and white fat in the rat.Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1969; 47: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, Slavin and Ballard, 1978Slavin B.G. Ballard K.W. Morphological studies on the adrenergic innervation of white adipose tissue.Anat. Rec. 1978; 191: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These older observations thus suggest that the adrenergic tone of WAT must somehow be amplified during cold stress to stimulate biogenesis of beige fat. In this regard, we recently reported that acute cold stress results in type 2 (alternative) activation of macrophages in WAT, which locally secrete catecholamines, to sustain the metabolic adaptations to environmental cold (Nguyen et al., 2011Nguyen K.D. Qiu Y. Cui X. Goh Y.P. Mwangi J. David T. Mukundan L. Brombacher F. Locksley R.M. Chawla A. Alternatively activated macrophages produce catecholamines to sustain adaptive thermogenesis.Nature. 2011; 480: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). These findings, which provide a potential explanation for this remodeling conundrum, led us to investigate the functions of type 2 cytokines, IL-4-producing cells, and alternatively activated macrophages in the biogenesis of beige fat. Here, we report that the cold-induced remodeling of scWAT into thermogenic beige fat is dependent on eosinophils, type 2 cytokines, macrophages, and myeloid-cell-derived catecholamines. Genetic disruption of IL-4/13 signaling or tyrosine hydroxylase (Th), the rate limiting step in the synthesis of catecholamines, in myeloid cells prevents cold-induced biogenesis of beige fat, whereas treatment of thermoneutral obese mice with IL-4 enhances the growth of beige fat to mitigate obesity and its attendant sequelae. These data provide fundamental insights into how the sensing of cold is translated into the biological program of beige fat differentiation and thermogenesis in mice, findings that have potential implications for increasing beige fat mass and function in humans. To investigate the role of type 2 immunity in biogenesis of cold-induced beige fat, we quantified the expression of thermogenic genes in scWAT of wild-type (WT) and Il4/13−/− mice housed at thermoneutrality (30°C), 22°C, or 5°C for 48 hr. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that prolonged exposure to environmental cold (5°C) induced the expression of the core set of thermogenic genes, including Ucp1, Ppargc1a, Cox8b, Cidea, Elovl3, and Cpt1b, in the scWAT, whose induction was largely absent in epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) of WT mice (Figures 1A and S1A available online). This cold-induced increase in expression of thermogenic genes was reduced by ∼4- to 9-fold in the scWAT of Il4/13−/− mice (Figure 1A). Congruent with these observations, expression of UCP1 protein, which is required for uncoupled respiration in brown and beige adipocytes (Cannon and Nedergaard, 2011Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Nonshivering thermogenesis and its adequate measurement in metabolic studies.J. Exp. Biol. 2011; 214: 242-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, Wu et al., 2012Wu J. Boström P. Sparks L.M. Ye L. Choi J.H. Giang A.H. Khandekar M. Virtanen K.A. Nuutila P. Schaart G. et al.Beige adipocytes are a distinct type of thermogenic fat cell in mouse and human.Cell. 2012; 150: 366-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar), was increased (∼4-fold) after cold exposure in the scWAT of WT, but not Il4/13−/−, mice (reduced by ∼80%, Figure 1B). This difference in scWAT UCP1 expression was also evident at 22°C, a housing temperature that is known to impose thermal stress in young mice (Figure 1B) (Cannon and Nedergaard, 2011Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Nonshivering thermogenesis and its adequate measurement in metabolic studies.J. Exp. Biol. 2011; 214: 242-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In contrast to the changes in scWAT, prolonged exposure to 5°C did not alter the expression or content of UCP1 in BAT of WT and Il4/13−/− mice (Figure 1B and Table S1A). Histologic analysis further affirmed that cold-induced remodeling of scWAT, but not eWAT, into beige fat was dependent on the type 2 cytokines IL-4 and-13, as evidenced by the paucity of multilocular, UCP1+ adipocytes in the scWAT of Il4/13−/− mice (Figures 1C, 1D, S1B, and S1C). Furthermore, measurement of oxygen consumption in scWAT and BAT of cold-exposed mice confirmed that type 2 cytokine signaling was preferentially required for the browning of scWAT, as evidenced by ∼51% and ∼70% reduction in the rate of oxygen of scWAT of Il4/13−/− mice housed at 22°C and 5°C, respectively (Figures 1E and 1F).Figure S1Metabolic Characteristics of IL-4/13-Deficient Animals at Different Environmental Temperatures, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Quantitative RT-PCR analyses of thermogenic gene expression in the eWAT of WT and Il4/13−/− mice at 30°C, 22°C, or 5°C for 48 hr (n = 5 per genotype and temperature).(B and C) Representative eWAT sections of WT and Il4/13−/− mice housed at 30°C, 22°C, or 5°C for 48 hr were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (B) or for UCP1 (C); scale bar, 100 μm.(D and E) Quantification of total activity (D) and food intake (E) in WT and Il4/13−/− mice at different environmental temperatures (n = 8 per genotype).Data are represented as mean ± SEM.

Recruited brown adipose tissue as an antiobesity agent in humans.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 3404-3408Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), we next investigated the thermogenic capacity of WT and Il4/13−/− mice under different environmental temperatures. Consistent with the human studies, total oxygen consumption was not different between WT and Il4/13−/− mice when they were housed at the thermoneutral temperature of 30°C (Figure 1G). However, exposure of these animals to progressively colder temperatures increased oxygen consumption in WT mice, a response that was blunted in Il4/13−/− mice, especially at 4°C (Figures 1H and 1I). This difference in energy expenditure (∼11%–12%) between WT and Il4/13−/− mice, which was independent of body mass (Table S1B and Figure 1I), likely reflects the thermogenic activity of beige fat because interscapular BAT UCP1 content, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), muscle thermogenic gene expression, total activity, and food intake were not different among the genotypes (Tables S1A, S1C, S2A, and S2B and Figures S1D and S1E). These data thus demonstrate that cold-induced remodeling of scWAT into functional beige fat requires the type 2 cytokines IL-4 and 13. We next investigated the downstream signaling pathways by which IL-4/13 mediate their browning effects in the scWAT. Because IL-4Rα is the shared subunit between the type I (IL-4Rα/γc) and II (IL-4Rα/IL-13Rα1) receptors (Kelly-Welch et al., 2003Kelly-Welch A.E. Hanson E.M. Boothby M.R. Keegan A.D. Interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 signaling connections maps.Science. 2003; 300: 1527-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), which mediate the known biologic effects of IL-4/13, we first examined the requirement of IL-4Rα in the biogenesis of beige fat. Similar to Il4/13−/− mice, cold-induced increases in thermogenic gene and UCP1 protein expression were reduced by ∼3- and 4- to 10-fold, respectively, in the scWAT of Il4ra−/− mice (Figures 2A and S2A). Histological examination confirmed that the scWAT of Il4ra−/− mice housed at 5°C had fewer multilocular, UCP1+ beige adipocytes (Figures 2B and S2B). Accordingly, cold-induced increase in energy expenditure (VO2 consumption) was reduced by ∼14%–24% in Il4ra−/− mice (Figures 2C and 2D ), whereas oxygen consumption was not different between WT and Il4ra−/− mice at thermoneutrality (Figure S2C). Moreover, deletion of Il4ra did not alter BAT UCP1 content, body mass, RER, muscle thermogenic gene expression, food intake, and total activity in these animals (Tables S1A–S1C, S2A, and S2B and Figures S2D and S2E). These results thus demonstrate that cold-induced activation of canonical IL-4/13 signaling via IL-4Rα mediates the remodeling of scWAT into thermogenic beige fat.Figure 2Signaling via IL-4Rα and STAT6 Controls Growth of Functional Beige FatShow full caption(A and E) Immunoblot analysis for UCP1 protein in the scWAT and BAT of WT, Il4/13−/− (A) and Stat6−/− (E) mice housed at 22°C or 5°C for 48 hr (n = 3 per genotype and temperature).(B and F) Representative sections of scWAT from WT, Il4ra−/− (B) and Stat6−/− (F) mice housed at various temperatures were stained for UCP1, scale bar 100 μm.(C, D, G, and H) Oxygen consumption (VO2) in WT, Il4ra−/− (C), and Stat6−/− (F) mice at 22°C and 4°C (n = 8–10 per genotype).(I) Core body temperature of WT, Il4/13−/−, Il4ra−/−, and Stat6−/− mice during a 48 hr cold challenge (n = 4 to 5 per genotype).Data are represented as mean ± SEM.

Signal. 2008; 1: ra17Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the reprogramming of cellular networks requires the transcription factor STAT6 in most cells (Goenka and Kaplan, 2011Goenka S. Kaplan M.H. Transcriptional regulation by STAT6.Immunol. Res. 2011; 50: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, Maier et al., 2012Maier E. Duschl A. Horejs-Hoeck J. STAT6-dependent and -independent mechanisms in Th2 polarization.Eur. J. Immunol. 2012; 42: 2827-2833Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This observation prompted us to investigate whether STAT6 might also be necessary for cold-induced remodeling of scWAT into beige fat. Indeed, the molecular, histologic, and metabolic phenotypes of cold-challenged Stat6−/− mice were similar to those of Il4/13−/− and Il4ra−/− mice (Figures 2E–2G and S2F–S2J). For instance, cold-induced expression of UCP1 protein in the scWAT was decreased by ∼12-fold in Stat6−/− mice (Figures 2E and 2F), as was the concomitant increase in oxygen consumption (Figures 2G and 2H). Accordingly, compared to WT mice, Il4/13−/−, Il4ra−/−, and Stat6−/− mice maintained thermal homeostasis at a lower body temperature (Figure 2I). In aggregate, these findings provide strong evidence to support the hypothesis that canonical type 2 immunity, specifically the IL4/13-IL4Rα-STAT6 pathway, is required for biogenesis of functional beige fat, and raise four important questions. First, what cells secrete IL-4 to support the remodeling of scWAT into thermogenic beige fat? Second, how does activation of IL4/13 signaling promote development of beige fat? Third, is administration of IL-4 sufficient to increase beige fat mass in thermoneutral mice? And fourth, can IL-4 induced increase in beige fat mass ameliorate metabolic disease in an established model of obesity? To identify cells competent for IL-4 production in scWAT, we housed 4get mice, which express green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the endogenous IL-4 locus (Mohrs et al., 2001Mohrs M. Shinkai K.

Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the majority (∼90%) of GFP+ cells in the scWAT of 4get mice housed at 5°C were eosinophils, as they expressed Siglec F and had high side scatter (Figure S3A) (Heredia et al., 2013Heredia J.E.

Using the recently identified isoform of PGC1-α (PGC1-α4) as a discovery tool, we report the identification of meteorin-like (Metrnl), a circulating factor that is induced in muscle after exercise and in adipose tissue upon cold exposure. Increasing circulating levels of Metrnl stimulates energy expenditure and improves glucose tolerance and the expression of genes associated with beige fat thermogenesis and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Metrnl stimulates an eosinophil-dependent increase in IL-4 expression and promotes alternative activation of adipose tissue macrophages, which are required for the increased expression of the thermogenic and anti-inflammatory gene programs in fat. Importantly, blocking Metrnl actions in vivo significantly attenuates chronic cold-exposure-induced alternative macrophage activation and thermogenic gene responses. Thus, Metrnl links host-adaptive responses to the regulation of energy homeostasis and tissue inflammation and has therapeutic potential for metabolic and inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2028593002,"The Hippo-signaling pathway is an important regulator of cellular proliferation and organ size. However, little is known about the role of this cascade in the control of cell fate. Employing a combination of lineage tracing, clonal analysis, and organoid culture approaches, we demonstrate that Hippo pathway activity is essential for the maintenance of the differentiated hepatocyte state. Remarkably, acute inactivation of Hippo pathway signaling in vivo is sufficient to dedifferentiate, at very high efficiencies, adult hepatocytes into cells bearing progenitor characteristics. These hepatocyte-derived progenitor cells demonstrate self-renewal and engraftment capacity at the single-cell level. We also identify the NOTCH-signaling pathway as a functional important effector downstream of the Hippo transducer YAP. Our findings uncover a potent role for Hippo/YAP signaling in controlling liver cell fate and reveal an unprecedented level of phenotypic plasticity in mature hepatocytes, which has implications for the understanding and manipulation of liver regeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2023289992,"Adipose tissue hypoxia and inflammation have been causally implicated in obesity-induced insulin resistance. Here, we report that, early in the course of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding and obesity, adipocyte respiration becomes uncoupled, leading to increased oxygen consumption and a state of relative adipocyte hypoxia. These events are sufficient to trigger HIF-1α induction, setting off the chronic adipose tissue inflammatory response characteristic of obesity. At the molecular level, these events involve saturated fatty acid stimulation of the adenine nucleotide translocase 2 (ANT2), an inner mitochondrial membrane protein, which leads to the uncoupled respiratory state. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of either ANT2 or HIF-1α can prevent or reverse these pathophysiologic events, restoring a state of insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. These results reveal the sequential series of events in obesity-induced inflammation and insulin resistance."

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is not only an important pathogen but a paradigm of viral immune evasion. QTV detailed how HCMV orchestrates the expression of >8,000 cellular proteins, including 1,200 cell-surface proteins to manipulate signaling pathways and counterintrinsic, innate, and adaptive immune defenses. QTV predicted natural killer and T cell ligands, as well as 29 viral proteins present at the cell surface, potential therapeutic targets. Temporal profiles of >80% of HCMV canonical genes and 14 noncanonical HCMV open reading frames were defined. QTV is a powerful method that can yield important insights into viral infection and is applicable to any virus with a robust in vitro model."
https://openalex.org/W2077157705,"Argonaute proteins of the PIWI clade are central to transposon silencing in animal gonads. Their target specificity is defined by 23-30 nt PIWI interacting RNAs (piRNAs), which mostly originate from discrete genomic loci termed piRNA clusters. Here, we show that a complex composed of Rhino, Deadlock, and Cutoff (RDC) defines dual-strand piRNA clusters genome-wide in Drosophila ovaries. The RDC is anchored to H3K9me3-marked chromatin in part via Rhino's chromodomain. Depletion of Piwi results in loss of the RDC and small RNAs at a subset of piRNA clusters, demonstrating a feedback loop between Piwi and piRNA source loci. Intriguingly, profiles of RNA polymerase II occupancy, nascent transcription, and steady-state RNA levels reveal that the RDC licenses noncanonical transcription of dual-strand piRNA clusters. Likely, this process involves 5' end protection of nascent RNAs and suppression of transcription termination. Our data provide key insight into the regulation and evolution of piRNA clusters."
https://openalex.org/W2167807799,"Bromine is ubiquitously present in animals as ionic bromide (Br(-)) yet has no known essential function. Herein, we demonstrate that Br(-) is a required cofactor for peroxidasin-catalyzed formation of sulfilimine crosslinks, a posttranslational modification essential for tissue development and architecture found within the collagen IV scaffold of basement membranes (BMs). Bromide, converted to hypobromous acid, forms a bromosulfonium-ion intermediate that energetically selects for sulfilimine formation. Dietary Br deficiency is lethal in Drosophila, whereas Br replenishment restores viability, demonstrating its physiologic requirement. Importantly, Br-deficient flies phenocopy the developmental and BM defects observed in peroxidasin mutants and indicate a functional connection between Br(-), collagen IV, and peroxidasin. We establish that Br(-) is required for sulfilimine formation within collagen IV, an event critical for BM assembly and tissue development. Thus, bromine is an essential trace element for all animals, and its deficiency may be relevant to BM alterations observed in nutritional and smoking-related disease. PAPERFLICK:"

The construction of high-density linkage maps appears more feasible since the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS), which eases SNP discovery and high-throughput genotyping of large population. However, the marker number explosion and genotyping errors from NGS data challenge the computational efficiency and linkage map quality of linkage study methods. Here we report the HighMap method for constructing high-density linkage maps from NGS data. HighMap employs an iterative ordering and error correction strategy based on a k-nearest neighbor algorithm and a Monte Carlo multipoint maximum likelihood algorithm. Simulation study shows HighMap can create a linkage map with three times as many markers as ordering-only methods while offering more accurate marker orders and stable genetic distances. Using HighMap, we constructed a common carp linkage map with 10,004 markers. The singleton rate was less than one-ninth of that generated by JoinMap4.1. Its total map distance was 5,908 cM, consistent with reports on low-density maps. HighMap is an efficient method for constructing high-density, high-quality linkage maps from high-throughput population NGS data. It will facilitate genome assembling, comparative genomic analysis, and QTL studies. HighMap is available at http://highmap.biomarker.com.cn/."

The Drosophila HP1 homolog Rhino is required for germline piRNA production. We show that Rhino binds specifically to the heterochromatic clusters that produce piRNA precursors, and that binding directly correlates with piRNA production. Rhino colocalizes to germline nuclear foci with Rai1/DXO-related protein Cuff and the DEAD box protein UAP56, which are also required for germline piRNA production. RNA sequencing indicates that most cluster transcripts are not spliced and that rhino, cuff, and uap56 mutations increase expression of spliced cluster transcripts over 100-fold. LacI::Rhino fusion protein binding suppresses splicing of a reporter transgene and is sufficient to trigger piRNA production from a trans combination of sense and antisense reporters. We therefore propose that Rhino anchors a nuclear complex that suppresses cluster transcript splicing and speculate that stalled splicing differentiates piRNA precursors from mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2089393338,"Acetylation of α-tubulin Lys40 by tubulin acetyltransferase (TAT) is the only known posttranslational modification in the microtubule lumen. It marks stable microtubules and is required for polarity establishment and directional migration. Here, we elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings for TAT activity and its preference for microtubules with slow turnover. 1.35 Å TAT cocrystal structures with bisubstrate analogs constrain TAT action to the microtubule lumen and reveal Lys40 engaged in a suboptimal active site. Assays with diverse tubulin polymers show that TAT is stimulated by microtubule interprotofilament contacts. Unexpectedly, despite the confined intraluminal location of Lys40, TAT efficiently scans the microtubule bidirectionally and acetylates stochastically without preference for ends. First-principles modeling and single-molecule measurements demonstrate that TAT catalytic activity, not constrained luminal diffusion, is rate limiting for acetylation. Thus, because of its preference for microtubules over free tubulin and its modest catalytic rate, TAT can function as a slow clock for microtubule lifetimes."

Consequently, there is intense focus on the discovery of novel inhibitors, e.g. small molecules and antibodies, to inhibit the formation and block the toxicity of oligomers.

Drugs that directly target and stabilize the αSN monomer, thereby keeping it in a soluble conformation, may compromise the (as yet unknown) physiological role of αSN. Instead of preventing oligomer formation, we here focus on inhibiting the toxicity of preformed toxic oligomers formed during the fibrillation process (30Giehm L. Svergun D.I. Otzen D.E.

Here, we use in vitro assays to analyze how EGCG reduces the oligomer toxicity of αSN. EGCG potently inhibits the ability of αSN oligomers to permeabilize membranes, as probed by a calcein release assay and fluorescence confocal microscopy. The inhibition of oligomer activity is confirmed by EGCG's ability to rescue rat neuronal cells from oligomer toxicity. Gratifyingly, inhibition occurs at similar EGCG concentrations in the membrane permeabilization assay and the extracellular toxicity assay. Liquid-state NMR spectroscopy shows that the N terminus and the NAC region build up the oligomer core, whereas the C terminus remains disordered in the oligomer state. We show that the flexibility of the C terminus decreases upon EGCG binding. Importantly, EGCG binds to the oligomers without changing either oligomer secondary structure or its size distribution. Thus, inhibition of membrane permeabilization and extracellular toxicity is not due to dissociation or aggregation of the oligomers. Rather, asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) and calorimetric analysis show that EGCG inhibits the toxicity of αSN oligomers by decreasing their interaction with membranes, thus highlighting reduction of oligomer-membrane interactions as a viable therapeutic approach against Parkinson disease. αSN was produced and purified according to Ref. 34Lorenzen N. Lemminger L. Pedersen J.N. Nielsen S.B. Otzen D.E. The N terminus of α-synuclein is essential for both monomeric and oligomeric interactions with membranes.FEBS Lett. 2014; 588: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar. 15N-Labeled αSN was produced and purified in the same way, with the exception that Escherichia coli was grown in M9 minimal media with 15NH4Cl as the only nitrogen source. A 100-ml preculture was inoculated with a transformed colony and grown overnight at 37 °C. The preculture was subsequently split into growth media and incubated at 37 °C until an A600 ∼0.6 was reached. Protein expression was induced by addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm followed by a 4-h incubation prior to harvest. Freshly dissolved αSN was filtered (0.2 μm) prior to use, and protein concentration was determined by absorption measurements with a NanoDrop UV-visible spectrophotometer (ND-1000, Thermo Scientific) using a theoretical extinction coefficient of 0.412 (mg/ml)−1 cm−1 for 280 nm. All experiments were carried out in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (20 mm phosphate, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4)). Monomeric αSN was incubated at 840 μm in PBS buffer for 5 h at 37 °C and 900 rpm shaking in a Biosan TS-100 Thermo shaker. Soluble material was separated from insoluble material by centrifugation at 13,400 rpm at room temperature and loaded on an ∼24-ml Superose 6 10/30 GL SEC column at 0.5 ml/min in PBS buffer. Small oligomers were separated from larger aggregates and monomers. The concentration of oligomers was estimated the same way as described above for monomers. When necessary, oligomers were concentrated using 0.5- and 15-ml Amicon ultracentrifugal filters (Merck). LUVs of pure 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-3-phosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) or 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-3-phosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) were dissolved at 5 mg/ml in PBS. The samples were subjected to 10 freeze-thaw cycles between liquid N2 and a 50 °C water bath, followed by 21 extrusions to a diameter of 100 or 200 nm. During extrusion of DMPG vesicles, the extruder was kept at 50 °C to keep the lipid in the liquid-disordered phase. DOPG vesicles for calcein release were prepared in the presence of 70 mm calcein. After extrusion, vesicles were separated from free calcein with a PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare). The fluorophore calcein was entrapped at self-quenching concentrations (70 mm) inside DOPG vesicles. Upon membrane permeabilization, calcein was released from the vesicles and diluted, leading to a fluorescence increase. Oligomers were mixed with varying concentrations of EGCG and 1% DMSO and loaded in triplicate in a 148-μl assay solution onto a 96-well plate (Nunc, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Roskilde, Denmark). The plates were sealed with crystal clear sealing tape (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) and incubated in a Genios Pro fluorescence plate reader (Tecan, Mänerdorf, Switzerland) for 1 h at 37 °C and a 2-s autoshake. Subsequently, DOPG vesicles with calcein were added to a final lipid concentration of ∼42 μm and a final volume of 150 μl of assay solution. Calcein release was monitored with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 520 nm for at least 1 h under the same conditions used for incubation. Titration of EGCG to vesicles did not lead to any changes in fluorescence signal nor did EGCG affect the fluorescence signal of free calcein, ruling out artifacts from fluorescence quenching (data not shown). The cell line used was OLN-93, an immortalized oligodendroglial cell line derived from primary Wistar rat brain glial cultures (39Richter-Landsberg C. Heinrich M. OLN-93: a new permanent oligodendroglia cell line derived from primary rat brain glial cultures.J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 45: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Cells were kept at 37 °C under 5% CO2 and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Lonza) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Briefly, 5000 cells/well were seeded into poly-l-lysine-coated 96-well plates with growth medium and allowed to attach for 24 h. αSN monomer or oligomer was added (final concentration 5 μm) to the cells with or without various concentrations of EGCG or αSN-specific antibody (ASY-1) and incubated for an additional 24 h. Cells were washed in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma, R7509), after which 50 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml in RPMI medium) was added. After 3 h, cells and the formed formazan crystals were dissolved in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 40 mm HCl diluted in isopropyl alcohol) and incubated on a shaker overnight shielded from light. The absorbance at 570 nm was measured, and background (650 nm) was subtracted in a VersaMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices). 5000 cells/well were seeded into poly-l-lysine-coated 96-well plates with growth medium and allowed to attach for 24 h. αSN monomer or oligomer was added (final concentration 5 μm) to the cells with or without various concentrations of EGCG or αSN-specific antibody (ASY-1) and incubated for additional 24 h. Cells were washed in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma, R7509), and 0.02% trypan blue in RPMI 1640 medium was subsequently added. Cells were visualized on an Olympus inverted microscope CKX41 connected to a camera, ×100 magnifications, and cell fractions with blue-stained nuclei were quantified. GUVs were prepared by the electroformation method originally described by Angelova and Dimitrov (40Angelova M.I. Dimitrov D.S. Liposome electroformation.Faraday Discuss. Chem. Soc. 1986; 81: 303-311Crossref Google Scholar). The GUVs were made using a home-built electroformation chamber partly built on the specifications published by Bagatolli and Gratton (41Bagatolli L.A. Gratton E. Two-photon fluorescence microscopy observation of shape changes at the phase transition in phospholipid giant unilamellar vesicles.Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2090-2101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). GUVs were prepared from chloroform stocks containing 10 g/liter. The chloroform lipid stocks were spread on platinum electrodes with ∼10 μl on each, and the solvent was allowed to evaporate. The chamber was filled with a solution of 200 mm sucrose containing Alexa 488. The platinum wires were connected to a function generator (Digimess FG 100, Grundig Instruments, Nürnberg, Germany), and a low frequency alternating field sinusoidal function with a frequency of 10 Hz and amplitude of 1.5 V was applied for 90 min followed by 30 min at 1 Hz and amplitude of 3 V. To remove free fluorophore, the GUVs were run over a PD10 column pre-equilibrated with 200 mm glucose. The eluent from the column was collected and transferred to an eight-well microscopy chamber (Lab-Tek Brand Products, Naperville, IL). GUVs were left overnight at 4 °C to allow them to sediment at the bottom of the viewing chamber prior to analysis. A single cysteine mutant of αSN (A140C) was produced and purified as described above. Labeling with Alexa 633 maleimide was carried out according to the procedures provided by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Alexa-labeled αSNs were mixed with unlabeled monomer at a ratio of 1:10, and oligomers were produced as described above. GUVs were equilibrated to room temperature in the microscopy wells for 15–20 min before measuring. 5 μl of Alexa 633-labeled αSN oligomer solution was injected into the microscope, and images were recorded every 6 s. GUVs were analyzed with an LSM 510 scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss GmbH, Jena, Germany). Excitation of Alexa 488 and 633 was done at 488 and 588 nm, and fluorescence emission was measured over 505–548 and 612–750 nm for Alexa 488 and 633, respectively. The NMR samples contained 200 μm protein in (monomer equivalents) PBS buffer, with about 6% (v/v) D2O and 0.1 mm sodium 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate as an internal chemical shift reference. 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance NMR spectrometer at 500 MHz 1H frequency at 1 °C. The spectra were processed using NMRPipe and analyzed with Sparky (42Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A.

Spectral assignment was taken from BMRB entry ID 18857. 5-μl aliquots of 28 μm oligomer (monomer equivalents) with varying molar ratios of EGCG (1:0, 1:1, and 1:5 (αSN/EGCG)) in PBS buffer were transferred to 400-mesh carbon-coated, glow-discharged grids for 30 s. The grids were washed using 2 drops of doubly distilled water, stained with 1% phosphotungstic acid (pH 6.8), and blotted dry on filter paper. The samples were viewed in a microscope (JEM-1010; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) operating at 60 kV. Images were obtained using an Olympus KeenViewG2 camera. Far-UV CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Spectroscopic Co. Ltd.). Ellipticity was measured at 25 °C, and five accumulations were averaged to yield the final spectrum. A 1.0-mm path length cuvette was used for 14 μm oligomer (monomer equivalents). The contribution from PBS buffer was subtracted, and the CD signal given as mean residue ellipticity expressed as degrees cm2 dmol−1. A ZS Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments) was used to measure the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of oligomer and vesicles at 25 °C. 21 μm oligomer (monomer equivalent) and 1.26 mm DOPG vesicles (molar ratio 1:60) were prepared with 100 nm diameter as described above. All samples were measured three to five times using 15–40 accumulated scans. We have given the Z-average with standard deviation of the accumulation scans. Data were recorded on an in-house instrument at Aarhus University (43Pedersen J.S. A flux- and background-optimized version of the NanoSTAR small-angle x-ray scattering camera for solution scattering.J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2004; 37: 369-380Crossref Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The acquisition time was 1 h for the samples and buffer solution. The concentration of the oligomer sample without EGCG was 127 μm, and 105 μm (monomer equivalents) was used in the sample with EGCG (1:1 molar ratio). Background subtraction and conversion to absolute scale was performed with home-written software. 8C. L. P. Oliveira and J. S. Pedersen, unpublished data."
https://openalex.org/W2107087586,"One of the most important challenges in network science is to quantify the information encoded in complex network structures. Disentangling randomness from organizational principles is even more demanding when networks have a multiplex nature. Multiplex networks are multilayer systems of nodes that can be linked in multiple interacting and co-evolving layers. In these networks, relevant information might not be captured if the single layers were analyzed separately. Here we demonstrate that such partial analysis of layers fails to capture significant correlations between weights and topology of complex multiplex networks. To this end, we study two weighted multiplex co-authorship and citation networks involving the authors included in the American Physical Society. We show that in these networks weights are strongly correlated with multiplex structure, and provide empirical evidence in favor of the advantage of studying weighted measures of multiplex networks, such as multistrength and the inverse multiparticipation ratio. Finally, we introduce a theoretical framework based on the entropy of multiplex ensembles to quantify the information stored in multiplex networks that would remain undetected if the single layers were analyzed in isolation."
https://openalex.org/W2170739826,"Phenotypic differences between closely related species are thought to arise primarily from changes in gene expression due to mutations in cis-regulatory sequences (enhancers). However, it has remained unclear how frequently mutations alter enhancer activity or create functional enhancers de novo. Here we use STARR-seq, a recently developed quantitative enhancer assay, to determine genome-wide enhancer activity profiles for five Drosophila species in the constant trans-regulatory environment of Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells. We find that the functions of a large fraction of D. melanogaster enhancers are conserved for their orthologous sequences owing to selection and stabilizing turnover of transcription factor motifs. Moreover, hundreds of enhancers have been gained since the D. melanogaster-Drosophila yakuba split about 11 million years ago without apparent adaptive selection and can contribute to changes in gene expression in vivo. Our finding that enhancer activity is often deeply conserved and frequently gained provides functional insights into regulatory evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2022137375,"In situations that would be expected to induce regret, the authors report that rats looked backwards towards a lost option, the cells in OFC and ventral striatum represented that missed action, rats were more likely to wait out a long delay, and then they rushed through consuming rewards, suggesting that regret-like processes modify decision-making in nonhuman mammals. Disappointment entails the recognition that one did not get the value expected. In contrast, regret entails recognition that an alternative (counterfactual) action would have produced a more valued outcome. In humans, the orbitofrontal cortex is active during expressions of regret, and humans with damage to the orbitofrontal cortex do not express regret. In rats and nonhuman primates, both the orbitofrontal cortex and the ventral striatum have been implicated in reward computations. We recorded neural ensembles from orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum in rats encountering wait or skip choices for delayed delivery of different flavors using an economic framework. Economically, encountering a high-cost choice after skipping a low-cost choice should induce regret. In these situations, rats looked backwards toward the lost option, cells within orbitofrontal cortex and ventral striatum represented the missed action, rats were more likely to wait for the long delay, and rats rushed through eating the food after that delay."

https://openalex.org/W2065256390,"In bacteria, most secretory proteins are translocated across the plasma membrane by the interplay of the SecA ATPase and the SecY channel. How SecA moves a broad range of polypeptide substrates is only poorly understood. Here we show that SecA moves polypeptides through the SecY channel by a ""push and slide"" mechanism. In its ATP-bound state, SecA interacts through a two-helix finger with a subset of amino acids in a substrate, pushing them into the channel. A polypeptide can also passively slide back and forth when SecA is in the predominant ADP-bound state or when SecA encounters a poorly interacting amino acid in its ATP-bound state. SecA performs multiple rounds of ATP hydrolysis before dissociating from SecY. The proposed push and slide mechanism is supported by a mathematical model and explains how SecA allows translocation of a wide range of polypeptides. This mechanism may also apply to hexameric polypeptide-translocating ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W2002818875,"Endocytosis is critical for cellular physiology and thus is highly regulated. To identify regulatory interactions controlling the endocytic membrane system, we conducted 13 RNAi screens on multiple endocytic activities and their downstream organelles. Combined with image analysis of thousands of single cells per perturbation and their cell-to-cell variability, this created a high-quality and cross-comparable quantitative data set. Unbiased analysis revealed emergent properties of the endocytic membrane system and how its complexity evolved and distinct programs of regulatory control that coregulate specific subsets of endocytic uptake routes and organelle abundances. We show that these subset effects allow the mapping of functional regulatory interactions and their interaction motifs between kinases, membrane-trafficking machinery, and the cytoskeleton at a large scale, some of which we further characterize. Our work presents a powerful approach to identify regulatory interactions in complex cellular systems from parallel single-gene or double-gene perturbation screens in human cells and yeast."

However, the functional interplay of KAP1 PTMs in regulating KAP1 turnover during DNA damage response remains unclear. To decipher the role and cross-talk of multiple KAP1 PTMs, we show here that DNA double strand break-induced KAP1 Ser-824 phosphorylation promoted the recruitment of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-targeted ubiquitin E3 ligase, ring finger protein 4 (RNF4), and subsequent RNF4-mediated, SUMO-dependent degradation. Besides the SUMO interacting motif (SIM), a previously unrecognized, but evolutionarily conserved, arginine-rich motif (ARM) in RNF4 acts as a novel recognition motif for selective target recruitment. Results from combined mutagenesis and computational modeling studies suggest that RNF4 utilizes concerted bimodular recognition, namely SIM for Lys-676 SUMOylation and ARM for Ser(P)-824 of simultaneously phosphorylated and SUMOylated KAP1 (Ser(P)-824-SUMO-KAP1). Furthermore, we proved that arginines 73 and 74 within the ARM of RNF4 are required for efficient recruitment to KAP1 or accelerated degradation of promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) under stress. In parallel, results of bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays validated the role of the ARM in recognizing Ser(P)-824 in living cells. Taken together, we establish that the ARM is required for RNF4 to efficiently target Ser(P)-824-SUMO-KAP1, conferring ubiquitin Lys-48-mediated proteasomal degradation in the context of double strand breaks. The conservation of such a motif may possibly explain the requirement for timely substrate selectivity determination among a myriad of SUMOylated proteins under stress conditions.

By covalently attaching small proteins to specific amino acid residues or by changing the structure or the chemical nature of the amino acids, the diversity of protein function can be largely expanded.

In contrast, Ser-824 phosphorylation of KAP1 (Ser(P)-824-KAP1) promotes the repair of DSBs within heterochromatin by inducing the chromatin to decondense (6Ziv Y. Bielopolski D. Galanty Y. Lukas C.

Furthermore, we have reported that the reduction of SUMOylated KAP1 (SUMO-KAP1) induced by KAP1 Ser-824 phosphorylation resulted in the transcriptional derepression of KAP1-targeted genes during DDR (7Li X.

Both phosphorylation and SUMOylation are critical PTMs for proper DDR, although little is known about the molecular interplay employed by KAP1 Ser-824 phosphorylation to regulate the abundance of SUMO-KAP1 molecules in the context of DNA damage. Therefore, we sought to decipher how the cross-talk of different types of PTMs regulates the fate of KAP1 in the context of DSB induction. The conventional thought that the SUMOylation and ubiquitylation systems operate independently or antagonistically has changed with recent discoveries of SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) (reviewed in Ref. 18Bologna S. Ferrari S. It takes two to tango: ubiquitin and SUMO in the DNA damage response.Front. Genet. 2013; 4: 1-18Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The identification of Slx8-Rfp, MIP1, Slx5-Slx8, and ring finger protein 4 (RNF4) suggests that SUMOylation and ubiquitylation can work cooperatively (19Prudden J. Pebernard S. Raffa G. Slavin D.A.

Therefore, STUbLs belong to a new class of ubiquitin E3 ligases that are recruited to SUMO-conjugated targeting proteins, resulting in ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation (23Perry J.J.

Among them, RNF4 is the only human homolog of Slx8-Rfp. The most conspicuous structural feature of RNF4 or STUbLs is the tandem SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) that have specific consensus sequences to interact with the SUMO or SUMO-like domains of their ubiquitylation targets (23Perry J.J.

The DNA damage response: making it safe to play with knives.Mol. Cell. 2010; 40: 179-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar), we speculated that RNF4 could have a key role in regulating Ser-824-phosphorylated KAP1 abundance. Here, we show that RNF4 engages an active process to accelerate the turnover of Ser-824-phosphoylated, Lys-676-SUMOylated KAP1 through a previously unrecognized arginine-rich motif (ARM). Our study further suggests that RNF4 utilizes bimodular recognition by both SIM and ARM to dynamically fine-tune its target selection. Human RNF4 was tagged with Myc by cloning it into pCMV-Tag3B after standard RT-PCR of cDNA that was reverse-transcribed from total human RNA and amplified with RNF4-specific primer pairs (5′-GACCGTGGATCCATGAGTACAAGAAAGCGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTGGAGAATTCTCATATATAAATGGGGTG-3′ (reverse). All Myc-RNF4 and HA-PML point mutations or deletions were generated from the Myc-RNF4 and HA-PML templates using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech). FLAG-RNF4, FLAG-ligase-dead RNF4, and FLAG-RNF4(Δ41–63) were provided by Dr. Ronald Hay. SFB-RNF4 was provided by Dr. Junjie Chen. All SFB-RNF4 deletion mutants were generated by the sequential PCR method and verified by sequencing. For the in vitro binding assay, SFB-RNF4 constructs containing different deletions were used as templates, and RNF4 was cloned into pT7CFE1 (Thermo Scientific) for in vitro translation. For bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays, RNF4 was cloned into the pBiFC-CC155 vector for fusion with C-terminal enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) at the C terminus of RNF4 (30Shyu Y.J.

Identification of new fluorescent protein fragments for bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis under physiological conditions.BioTechniques. 2006; 40: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). FLAG-KAP1(WT) and the mutants were used as templates to generate short-form constructs. The full-length or PHD-bromodomain (aa 625–835) of KAP1 was then cloned into the pBiFC-VN173 vector for fusion with N-terminal venus at the C terminus of KAP1 (30Shyu Y.J. Liu H. Deng X. Hu C.-D.

HEK293, HeLa, and U2OS cells were maintained (37 °C, 5% CO2) in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. MCF7 cells were maintained in the same medium supplemented with recombinant human insulin (0.01 mg/ml). HEK293/shRNF4, MCF7/shKAP1, and MCF7/shRNF4 cells were cultured in HEK293 or MCF7 medium with puromycin (2 μg/ml). The proteasome inhibitor MG132 was obtained from Calbiochem and used at 5 or 10 μm in this study. Cycloheximide (CHX) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and used at 100 μg/ml to inhibit protein synthesis. Whole cell lysates were prepared by lysing cells with Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche) and PhosphoSTOP phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Roche). Equal amounts of whole cell extracts were first separated by SDS-PAGE and then Western blotted and probed with antibodies. The antibodies used on the Western blots were FLAG (M2, Sigma-Aldrich), KAP1 (Bethyl and a gift from Dr. David Schultz), Ser(P)-824-KAP1 (Bethyl), HA (Covance), β-actin (Millipore), RNF4 (Abnova and a gift from Drs. Ronald Hay and Jorma Palvimo (31Häkli M. Karvonen U. Jänne O.A. Palvimo J.J. SUMO-1 promotes association of SNURF (RNF4) with PML nuclear bodies.Exp.

Blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL-Plus, GE Biosciences) using a Versadoc 3000 imaging system (Bio-Rad). Densitometric data were obtained and analyzed with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad), which provides a 4.8-order linear range of tracing. The Western blot analyses shown are representative of two to four independent experiments. FLAG-KAP1(WT) or its mutants were cotransfected with an EGFP-SUMO-1 expression construct into HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine 2000. Whole cell lysates were prepared by lysing the cells as described previously (8Li X. Lin H.H. Chen H. Xu X. Shih H.M. Ann D.K. SUMOylation of the transcriptional co-repressor KAP1 is regulated by the serine and threonine phosphatase PP1.Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra32Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG (for KAP1) or other antibodies (1 μl) were mixed with whole cell lysate (1 mg), and samples were rotated (4 °C, 2 h). Protein A/G Plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to bind and elute precipitated proteins. Eluates were examined on Western blots probed with the appropriate antibodies. To pull down SFB-RNF4, cells were lysed with NETN buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) and mixed with S protein-agarose (Novagen), and then we analyzed the eluates on Western blots probed with the appropriate antibodies. The lentiviral vectors pLKO.1-shRNF4, pΔ8.7, and pVSV-G were constructed and used to produce lentivirus in HEK293FT cells, as described previously (32Nguyen H.-V. Chen J.-L. Zhong J. Kim K.-J.

Viral supernatant was collected, pooled, concentrated, and stored as described previously (32Nguyen H.-V. Chen J.-L. Zhong J. Kim K.-J. Crandall E.D. Borok Z. Chen Y. Ann D.K.

For lentiviral infection, HEK293 and MCF7 cells were plated 1 day prior to infection and cultured overnight to ∼50% confluency. The culture medium was then aspirated, and fresh medium was added that contained concentrated lentiviruses with an empty vector, an shRNA against human RNF4, or a random sequence (as a control). Cells and viruses were incubated for 24 h in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. All studies used mixed populations of transduced cells. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for the plasmid DNA transfections according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The transfected cells were analyzed 48 h after transfection. A Shepherd Mark I cesium 137 γ irradiator was used to irradiate cells at a fixed dose rate of 1–2 Gy/min. Cells were irradiated, washed with PBS, and fixed (30 min, −20 °C) in ice-cold methanol and ethanol (1:1, v/v) at the end of the desired, post-IR incubation period. For pre-extraction, after the PBS wash, cells were pre-extracted using CSK buffer (10 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 300 mm sucrose, and 0.5% Triton X-100) (5 min, on ice), washed with CSK buffer and PBS, and fixed in 4% formaldehyde (15 min, 4 °C). Cells were blocked in blocking buffer (PBS containing 2% BSA) and then incubated with the appropriate primary antibody. Antibodies used were Ser(P)-824-KAP1 (Bethyl, 1:500), RNF4 (Abnova, 1:200), γ-H2AX (Millipore, 1:500), and FK2 and Lys-48-Ub (Millipore, 1:1000) in incubation buffer (PBS containing 2% BSA). Cells were then washed with PBS-Tween 20 and incubated with a fluorescent secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse or Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit, Invitrogen). Cells were then washed with PBS-Tween 20 and mounted on slides using ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Slides were viewed using a ×60 objective on an inverted IX81 microscope or a ×100 objective on an AX70 fluorescence microscope. Images were collected and processed using Image-Pro 6.3 software. The final conformation was chosen from the top 2000 docked conformations. These were ranked on the basis of the geometrical, hydrophobic, and electrostatic complementarities of the molecular surface and by considering the biochemical evidence reported here. In consideration of the flexibility of the SUMO C-terminal loop region from aa residues 94–97 and the NMR structure of KAP1 missing aa residues 813–824, these two regions were modeled by using the loop search method in the Biopolymer module implemented in the SYBYL 6.8 (TRIPOS, St. Louis, MO) package. In the modeled structure, an isopeptide bond was assigned between SUMO Gly-97 and KAP1 Lys-676, and the Ser(P)-824 of KAP1 was constructed and located close to the ARM motif in RNF4. Then, the resultant structure was minimized stepwise with the Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement (AMBER) force field in the SYBYL package to remove possible steric hindrances and to obtain a lower energy conformation. Subsequently, a 1-ns molecular dynamics simulation was carried out using the AMBER package (version 10.0) to sample a more reasonable conformation. Chromatin was fractionated using a modified version of a previous protocol (33Méndez J. Stillman B.

https://openalex.org/W2006137017,"Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a progressive disorder characterized by endothelial dysfunction and proliferation. Hypoxia induces PH by increasing vascular remodeling. A potential mediator in hypoxia-induced PH development is arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase (ALOX5). While ALOX5 metabolites have been shown to promote pulmonary vasoconstriction and endothelial cell proliferation, the contribution of ALOX5 to hypoxia-induced proliferation remains unknown. We hypothesize that hypoxia exposure stimulates HPAEC proliferation by increasing ALOX5 expression and activity. To test this, human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) were cultured under normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions for 24-, 48-, or 72 hours. In a subset of cells, the ALOX5 inhibitor, zileuton, or the 5-lipoxygenase activating protein inhibitor, MK-886, was administered during hypoxia exposure. ALOX5 expression was measured by qRT-PCR and western blot and HPAEC proliferation was assessed. Our results demonstrate that 24 and 48 hours of hypoxia exposure have no effect on HPAEC proliferation or ALOX5 expression. Seventy two hours of hypoxia significantly increases HPAEC ALOX5 expression, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) release, and HPAEC proliferation. We also demonstrate that targeted ALOX5 gene silencing or inhibition of the ALOX5 pathway by pharmacological blockade attenuates hypoxia-induced HPAEC proliferation. Furthermore, our findings indicate that hypoxia-induced increases in cell proliferation and ALOX5 expression are dependent on H2O2 production, as administration of the antioxidant PEG-catalase blocks these effects and addition of H2O2 to HPAEC promotes proliferation. Overall, these studies indicate that hypoxia exposure induces HPAEC proliferation by activating the ALOX5 pathway via the generation of H2O2."

As a secretase, BACE1 also cleaves additional membrane-bound molecules by exerting various cellular functions. In this study, we showed that BACE1 can effectively shed the membrane-anchored signaling molecule Jagged 1 (Jag1).Wealso mapped the cleavage sites of Jag1 by ADAM10 and ADAM17. Although Jag1 shares a high degree of homology with Jag2 in the ectodomain region, BACE1 fails to cleave Jag2 effectively, indicating a selective cleavage of Jag1. Abolished cleavage of Jag1 in BACE1-null mice leads to enhanced astrogenesis and, concomitantly, reduced neurogenesis.

Here we present the first report of an Ncs6 homolog of archaea (NcsA of Haloferax volcanii) that is essential for maintaining cellular pools of thiolated tRNA(Lys)UUU and for growth at high temperature. When purified from Hfx. volcanii, NcsA was found to be modified at Lys204 by isopeptide linkage to polymeric chains of the ubiquitin-fold protein SAMP2. The ubiquitin-activating E1 enzyme homolog of archaea (UbaA) was required for this covalent modification. Non-covalent protein partners that specifically associated with NcsA were also identified including UbaA, SAMP2, proteasome activating nucleotidase (PAN)-A/1, translation elongation factor aEF-1α and a β-CASP ribonuclease homolog of the archaeal cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 1 family (aCPSF1). Together, our study reveals that NcsA is essential for growth at high temperature, required for formation of thiolated tRNA(Lys)UUU and intimately linked to homologs of ubiquitin-proteasome, translation and RNA processing systems."

https://openalex.org/W2066713111,"Objective Therapeutic options for Parkinson's disease mainly consist of L-dopa and dopamine agonists. However, in Japan, the product labeling of the ergot dopamine agonists, cabergoline and pergolide, was revised in April 2007 due to the risk of developing cardiac valvulopathy. Here, we describe the prescribing trends of anti-Parkinson drugs from 2005 through 2010 in Japan, and examined whether these trends changed after the drug safety measures in 2007. Methods and Patients We used medical claim data from January 2005 to December 2010 for Parkinson's disease patients older than 30 years who were prescribed anti-Parkinson drugs. We calculated the proportion of patients prescribed each drug for each year, and compared the proportions of first-line drugs prescribed before and after April 2007. We also examined the prescription variations of cabergoline/pergolide users one year before or after April 2007. Results L-dopa was the most frequently prescribed drug for Parkinson's disease (2005, 58%; 2010, 51%). The proportion of patients prescribed ergot dopamine agonists markedly decreased and non-ergot dopamine agonists increased after 2007. Among first-line drugs, the proportion of non-ergot agents increased after April 2007. Among 54 cabergoline/pergolide users, 24 (44%) discontinued these drugs, nine of whom switched to non-ergot agents. Conclusion L-dopa was the mainstay of Parkinson's disease treatment between 2005 and 2010 in Japan. There was a decrease in ergot agents and an increase in non-ergot agents prescribed after the regulatory actions in 2007."
https://openalex.org/W2049050811,"The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is unique in responding to 2 physiological ligands: aldosterone and cortisol. In epithelial tissues, aldosterone selectivity is determined by the activity of 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2. In other tissues, cortisol is the primary ligand. To understand the structural determinants of ligand-specific MR activation, we sought to identify coregulatory molecules that interact with the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of the MR. A yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) kidney cDNA library was screened with the human MR-LBD in the presence of aldosterone and cortisol. One clone, identified as aldosteronespecific in the Y2H assay, exhibited a 7-fold greater response, aldosterone vs. cortisol, in a mammalian-2-hybrid (M2H) assay. This clone encodes the region of the tesmin gene that has 2 leucine-x-x-leucine-leucine (LxxLL) motifs. Full-length tesmin coactivates (>2-fold) MR-mediated transactivation in the presence of aldosterone, but not of cortisol; this specificity is observed with a range of promoters. GST pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation of the MR by tesmin supports a direct interaction, mediated by the 2 LxxLL motifs. Tesmin thus represents a novel MR coregulator that exhibits a differential interaction, providing further evidence of the adoption of ligand-dependent conformations by the MR-LBD.—Rogerson, F.

https://openalex.org/W2031333218,"Actin-myosin interactions are well studied using soluble myosin fragments, but little is known about effects of myosin filament structure on mechanochemistry. We stabilized unphosphorylated smooth muscle myosin (SMM) and phosphorylated smooth muscle myosin (pSMM) filaments against ATP-induced depolymerization using a cross-linker and attached fluorescent rhodamine (XL-Rh-SMM). Electron micrographs showed that these side polar filaments are very similar to unmodified filaments. They are ~0.63 μm long and contain ~176 molecules. Rate constants for ATP-induced dissociation and ADP release from acto-myosin for filaments and S1 heads were similar. Actin-activated ATPases of SMM and XL-Rh-SMM were similarly regulated. XL-Rh-pSMM filaments moved processively on F-actin that was bound to a PEG brush surface. ATP dependence of filament velocities was similar to that for solution ATPases at high [actin], suggesting that both processes are limited by the same kinetic step (weak to strong transition) and therefore are attachment- limited. This differs from actin sliding over myosin monomers, which is primarily detachment-limited. Fitting filament data to an attachment-limited model showed that approximately half of the heads are available to move the filament, consistent with a side polar structure. We suggest the low stiffness subfragment 2 (S2) domain remains unhindered during filament motion in our assay. Actin-bound negatively displaced heads will impart minimal drag force because of S2 buckling. Given the ADP release rate, the velocity, and the length of S2, these heads will detach from actin before slack is taken up into a backwardly displaced high stiffness position. This mechanism explains the lack of detachment- limited kinetics at physiological [ATP]. These findings address how nonlinear elasticity in assemblies of motors leads to efficient collective force generation."
https://openalex.org/W2079532267,"Matrix population models are widely used to study population dynamics but have been criticized because their outputs are sensitive to the dimension of the matrix (or, equivalently, to the class width). This sensitivity is concerning for the population growth rate () because this is an intrinsic characteristic of the population that should not depend on the model specification. It has been suggested that the sensitivity of to matrix dimension was linked to the existence of fast pathways (i.e. the fraction of individuals that systematically move up a class), whose proportion increases when class width increases. We showed that for matrix population models with growth transition only from class to class , was independent of the class width when the mortality and the recruitment rates were constant, irrespective of the growth rate. We also showed that if there were indeed fast pathways, there were also in about the same proportion slow pathways (i.e. the fraction of individuals that systematically remained in the same class), and that they jointly act as a diffusion process (where diffusion here is the movement in size of an individual whose size increments are random according to a normal distribution with mean zero). For 53 tree species from a tropical rain forest in the Central African Republic, the diffusion resulting from common matrix dimensions was much stronger than would be realistic. Yet, the sensitivity of to matrix dimension for a class width in the range 1–10 cm was small, much smaller than the sampling uncertainty on the value of . Moreover, could either increase or decrease when class width increased depending on the species. Overall, even if the class width should be kept small enough to limit diffusion, it had little impact on the estimate of for tree species."

Additional micro-injection studies will improve the understanding of how nesfatin-1 acts on the brain and define specific nuclei responsive to nesfatin-1, which will provide insight on its effects on food intake. We evaluated how nesfatin-1 injection into the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) modulates food intake response in rats during the dark phase. Consistent with previous observations, nesfatin-1-injected rats significantly reduced cumulative food intake over a 5-h period in rats. Chronic administration of nesfatin-1 into the DVC reduced body weight gain over a 10-day period. Because glucosensing neurons in the DVC are involved in glucoprivic feeding and homeostatic control of blood glucose, we examined the effect of nesfatin-1 on the excitability of DVC glucosensing neurons. Nesfatin-1 inhibited most of the glucose-inhibitory (GI) neurons and excited most of the glucose-excitatory (GE) neurons in the DVC. Current-clamp electrophysiology recordings from DVC glucosensing neurons in slice preparation showed that bath applied nesfatin-1(10 nM) increased the firing frequency of GE neurons and inhibited the firing rate of GI-neurons. Nesfatin-1 inhibited 88.9% (16/18) of gastric distension inhibitory (GD-INH) neurons and excited 76.2% (32/42) of gastric distension excitatory (GD-EXC) neurons. Thus, nesfatin-1 may control food intake by modulating the excitability of glucosensing neurons in the DVC."

In the present study, we conducted the in silico and in vitro characterization of three AC variants, where one (Asn347; ACm1A), two (Arg338 and Asp360; ACm2A), or three residues (Arg338, Asn347, and Asp360; ACm3A) were substituted with Ala. Biochemical studies showed that the affinities of ACm1A and ACm2A for CaM were not affected significantly, whereas that of ACm3A was reduced dramatically. To understand the effects of these modifications, molecular dynamics simulations were performed based on the modified proteins. The molecular dynamics trajectories recorded for the ACm3A·C-CaM complex showed that the calcium-binding loops of C-CaM exhibited large fluctuations, which could be related to the weakened interaction between ACm3A and its activator.

Several crystallographic structures have been reported of the CyaA catalytic domain (adenylyl cyclase; AC) in complex with the C-terminal moiety of CaM (C-CaM) (13Guo Q. Shen Y. Lee Y.S. Gibbs C.S. Mrksich M. Tang W.J. Structural basis for the interaction of Bordetella pertussis adenylyl cyclase toxin with calmodulin.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3190-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). These structures are physiologically relevant because C-CaM has been shown (14Shen Y. Lee Y.S. Soelaiman S. Bergson P. Lu D. Chen A. Beckingham K. Grabarek Z. Mrksich M. Tang W.J. Physiological calcium concentrations regulate calmodulin binding and catalysis of adenylyl cyclase exotoxins.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6721-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) to be as potent in activating the enzymatic activity of AC as the full-length CaM. In the AC·C-CaM complex (Fig. 1a), the AC domain includes three main regions: CA (residues 7–61, 187–197, 261–299, and 313–345; colored in green) in the middle of the structure and CB (residues 62–186; colored in orange) and SA (residues 192–254; colored in purple) at the two extremities. The C-terminal tail (residues 346–364; colored in cyan) and the C-loop of the catalytic site (residues 300–312; colored in yellow) are found in the CA region. At the C-terminal end of AC, a loop-helix-loop (LHL) motif that includes residues from Arg338 to Asp360 (Fig. 1c) is present at the interface between C-CaM and a major AC catalytic loop that spans residues 300–312.

In a previous study (15Selwa E. Laine E. Malliavin T. Differential role of calmodulin and calcium ions in the stabilization of the catalytic domain of adenyl cyclase CyaA from Bordetella pertussis.Proteins. 2012; 80: 1028-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we analyzed the interaction between the catalytic domain of AC from B. pertussis and C-CaM based on the molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories using maps of the energetic influences (16Hamacher K. Trylska J. McCammon J. Dependency map of proteins in the small ribosomal subunit.PloS Comput. Biol. 2006; 2: e10Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Laine E. Blondel A. Malliavin T. Dynamics and energetics: a consensus analysis of the impact of calcium on EF-CaM protein complex.Biophys. J. 2009; 96: 1249-1263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Three residues in the LHL motif (i.e. Arg338, Asn347, and Asp360) (Fig. 1b), were predicted to be important for the stability of the AC/CaM interaction, where Arg338 and Asp360 make contact with C-CaM, whereas Asn347 is in direct contact with the AC catalytic loop. In the present study, to further characterize the potential roles of these residues in AC/CaM interactions, we performed in silico MD simulations and in vitro biochemical and biophysical studies of the three modified AC proteins, where one (Asn347; ACm1A), two (Arg338 and Asp360; ACm2A), or three residues (Arg338, Asn347, and Asp360; ACm3A) were substituted with Ala. We found that the ACm3A variant exhibited a strongly reduced affinity for CaM, whereas the affinities of the ACm1A and ACm2A variants were similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. This demonstrated the strong synergistic effects of the three mutations. The MD simulations showed that the differences in the behavior of the modified and wild-type complexes were related to differences in the internal mobility of the C-CaM calcium loops. These differences in mobility may induce direct or indirect weakening of the C-CaM/AC interaction observed in the ACm3A modified protein. These results as well as an analysis of the geometrical strain suggest that the LHL motif at the C-terminal end of AC is important for establishing a long range connection between CaM binding and the stabilization of the AC catalytic loop in an active configuration; thus, it is a critical module during the allosteric activation of AC by CaM. The wild-type AC·C-CaM complexes in the presence (ACwt_2Ca) and absence (ACwt_0Ca) of calcium were prepared as described previously (15Selwa E. Laine E. Malliavin T.

Plasmids pKTRACm2A and pKTRACm3A, which were used to express ACm2A and ACm3A, respectively, were constructed from plasmid pKTRAC, an expression vector for the CyaC and CyaA proteins of B. pertussis. This plasmid was obtained from plasmid pTRACG (25Gmira S. Karimova G. Ladant D. Characterization of recombinant Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase toxins carrying passenger proteins.Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 889-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) by replacing the ampicillin resistance gene with a kanamycin-resistant gene from plasmid pKT25 (26Karimova G. Ullmann A. Ladant D. Protein-protein interaction between Bacillus stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase subdomains revealed by a bacterial two-hybrid system.J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 73-82PubMed Google Scholar). In pKTRAC, both the cyaC and cyaA genes are expressed under the control of the λ phage Pr promoter. The plasmid has a ColE1 replication origin, and it also expresses a thermosensitive λ repressor cI857, which strongly represses gene transcription at the λ Pr promoter at temperatures below 32 °C. Thus, expression of the CyaC and CyaA proteins can be triggered by shifting the cells to 37–42 °C. Plasmid pKTRACm3A was constructed by subcloning between the unique AgeI and BamHI sites of pKTRAC a synthetic gene (synthesized by GeneArt, Invitrogen) that encodes CyaA residues 320–384, followed by the two residues Gly and Lys, and where the three codons, Arg338, Asn347, and Asp360, were changed to Ala codons (the sequence of the ACm3A gene is available upon request). Plasmid pKTRACm2A was constructed by subcloning between the unique SnaBI and BsiWI sites of plasmid pKTRACm3A using a double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide produced via the hybridization of the following two oligonucleotides: 5′-GTTTTCTACGAAAACCGCGC-3′ and 5′-GTACGCGCGGTTTTCGTAGAAAAC-3′ (Eurofins MWG GmbH, Ebersberg, Germany), thereby restoring the wild-type Asn347 codon (the SnaBI site was abolished after oligonucleotide insertion; data available upon request). The DNA sequences of the modified cyaA′ genes in pKTRACm2A and pKTRACm3A were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Eurofins MWG GmbH, Ebersberg, Germany). Plasmid pKT7AC contained a synthetic AC gene (synthesized by GeneArt, Invitrogen) that encoded the first 384 codons of CyaA, which was optimized for high expression in Escherichia coli, followed by the two residues Gly and Lys (the full DNA sequence is available upon request). This synthetic AC gene was cloned under the control of a T7 promoter and a synthetic RBS sequence in the vector pMK-RQ (GeneArt, Invitrogen), a plasmid with a ColE1 replication origin and a kanamycin resistance gene. Plasmid pKT7ACm1A was used to express ACm1A, and it was constructed by subcloning between the unique SnaBI and BsiWI sites of plasmid pKT7AC, a double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide, which was obtained by hybridizing two oligonucleotides: 5′-GTGTTCTACGAAGCTCGCGC-3′ and 5′-GTACGCGCGAGCTTCGTAGAACAC-3′ (Eurofins MWG GmbH, Ebersberg, Germany), thereby replacing the wild-type Asn347 codon with an Ala codon (sequence available upon request). The DNA sequence of the modified cyaA′ gene in pKT7ACm1A was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Eurofins MWG GmbH, Ebersberg, Germany). The wild-type AC, ACm2A, and ACm3A were expressed in the E. coli BLR strain (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) by transformation with the plasmids pTRAC384GK, pKTRACm2A, and pKTRACm3A, respectively. The transformants were grown at 30 °C in LB medium that contained either 100 μg/ml ampicillin (for plasmid pTRAC384GK) or 50 μg/ml kanamycin (for plasmids pKTRACm2A or pKTRACm3A). When the culture reached an optical density of 0.6–0.8 at 600 nm, expression of the proteins was triggered by shifting the growth temperature to 42 °C. After 150 min of additional growth at 42 °C, the cells were collected by centrifugation (20 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C), and the cell pellets were frozen at −20 °C. ACm1A was expressed in the E. coli KRX strain (Promega, Madison, WI), which was transformed with the plasmid pKT7ACm1A. The transformants were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin to an optical density of 0.6–0.8. Next, expression of the proteins was triggered by the addition of 0.1% rhamnose (to induce the expression of the chromosomally encoded T7 RNA polymerase). After 180 min of additional growth at 37 °C, the cells were collected by centrifugation, as described above. The cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.5, and disrupted by sonication at 4 °C. The sonicated suspension was centrifuged for 20 min at 13,000 × g and 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 8 m urea with 20 mm HEPES-Na (pH 7.5) and agitated overnight at 4 °C. After 20 min of centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C, the supernatant (“urea extract”) that contained the solubilized AC proteins was collected. The AC proteins were purified according to a previously described protocol using two sequential chromatographic treatments with DEAE-Sepharose (24Vougier S. Mary J. Dautin N. Vinh J. Friguet B. Ladant D. Essential role of methionine residues in calmodulin binding to Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase, as probed by selective oxidation and repair by the peptide methionine sulfoxide reductases.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30210-30218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, the urea extract was first loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose column (20 ml of packed resin) equilibrated in 8 m urea with 20 mm HEPES-Na (pH 7.5). In these conditions, the AC protein did not bind to the resin, and it was recovered in the flow-through fractions. The collected flow-through fractions were then diluted 5 times with 20 mm HEPES-Na (pH 7.5) and applied to a second DEAE-Sepharose column (20 ml of packed resin), which had been equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES-Na (pH 7.5). In these conditions, the AC proteins were retained on the resin and, after extensive washing with 20 mm HEPES-Na (pH 7.5), the proteins were eluted in a soluble form using 20 mm HEPES-Na (pH 7.5) containing 100–200 mm NaCl. All of the AC protein preparations exceeded a purity of 95% according to SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 6A). The AC protein content was determined based on the absorption spectra using an extinction coefficient at 278 nm of 28,000 m−1/cm−1. The activity of AC was measured using a sensitive colorimetric assay, which was reported recently (27Laine E. Goncalves C. Karst J.C. Lesnard A. Rault S. Tang W.J. Malliavin T.E. Ladant D. Blondel A. Use of allostery to identify inhibitors of calmodulin-induced activation of Bacillus anthracis edema factor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 11277-11282Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). AC converts ATP into cAMP and pyrophosphate (PPi), and the latter can be hydrolyzed further by an exogenously added pyrophosphatase into two phosphate molecules (Pi), which can be quantified using a standard colorimetric assay based on the change in the absorbance of malachite green dye in the presence of phosphomolybdate complexes. The amount of Pi produced was determined using the Pi ColorLockTM ALS colorimetric assay from Innova Biosciences (Cambridge, UK). The AC enzymatic assays were performed using a 96-well microtiter plate at 30 °C in a final volume of 50 μl, which contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 units/ml E. coli inorganic pyrophosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich; the amount of pyrophosphatase added to the reaction medium was found to be sufficient to ensure the immediate and complete conversion of the released PPi into Pi), 0–1 μm CaM, and 0.1–1 nm (depending on the specific activity) AC proteins (diluted from stock solutions in 10 mm Tris-HCl with 0.2% Tween 20, pH 8.0). The mixtures were preincubated for 10 min at 30 °C. Then the enzymatic reactions were initiated by adding 2 mm ATP (final concentration), and the microplate was incubated at 30 °C with agitation. At various incubation times (typically 2–10 min), 10-μl samples were taken from each well and transferred into a second 96-well microtiter plate, where each well contained 100 μl of a Pi-ALS mixture made of 2 volumes of H2O plus 8 volumes of Pi ColorLock ALS reagent (provided in the Pi-ALS kit from Innova Biosciences). The enzymatic reaction was stopped immediately by the acidic conditions of the Pi-ALS mixture. After 10–13 min of incubation at room temperature, 10 μl of stabilizer solution (from the Pi-ALS kit) was added to prevent further nonenzymatic breakdown of the phosphorylated substrate in acidic conditions (according to the kit instructions). After further incubation for 30–60 min at room temperature, the optical density at 595 nm (A595) was recorded using a microplate reader (Tecan, Lyon, France). A standard curve was obtained in parallel by adding known concentrations of Pi to the Pi-ALS mixture, which was used to convert the A595 values into moles of PPi produced. The enzymatic activity was calculated based on the initial velocity of PPi synthesis (in the conditions described above, the accumulation of PPi was linear with time). Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare), which was controlled by a GPCmax module that was connected online to a triple detector array (TDA), model 302 (Viscotek Ltd., Houston, UK), as described previously (28Karst J.C. Sotomayor-Pérez A.C. Guijarro J.I. Raynal B. Chenal A. Ladant D. Calmodulin-induced conformational and hydrodynamic changes in the catalytic domain of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase toxin.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 318-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The running buffer was buffer A (20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4), and the protein concentrations were 10–20 μm. Synchrotron radiation CD experiments were conducted at the SOLEIL synchrotron facility (DISCO beamline, Gif-sur-Yvette, France), as described previously (29Sotomayor-Pérez A.C. Subrini O. Hessel A. Ladant D. Chenal A. Molecular crowding stabilizes both the intrinsically disordered calcium-free state and the folded calcium-bound state of a repeat in toxin (RTX) protein.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013; 135: 11929-11934Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, the synchrotron radiation CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C using an integration time of 1.2 s and a bandwidth of 1 nm, with a 1-nm resolution step. Each far-UV spectrum represented the average of at least three individual scans. Optical cells with a 26-μm path length and CaF2 windows (Hellma) were used for recording CD signals in the far-UV region (180–260 nm). The protein concentrations were 25–50 μm for AC proteins and 250 μm for CaM in buffer A. Equimolar mixtures of enzyme and activator were used to obtain the AC-CaM and ACm3A-CaM spectra. The thermodynamic stability of the AC proteins was investigated by following their urea-induced denaturation (at 25 °C, in buffer A), which was monitored by tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy as described previously (30Chenal A. Karst J.C. Sotomayor-Pérez A.C. Wozniak A.K. Baron B. England P. Ladant D. Calcium-induced folding and stabilization of the intrinsically disordered RTX domain of the CyaA toxin.Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 3744-3753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), using an FP-6200 spectrofluorimeter (Jasco, Japan) in a Peltier-thermostated cell holder, with a 1-cm path length quartz cell (101.QS, Hellma). The thermodynamic parameters (urea concentration required to unfold half the population of native proteins ([urea]½), the cooperativity (m), and free energy (ΔG)) were deduced from the fluorescence data, as described previously (30Chenal A. Karst J.C. Sotomayor-Pérez A.C. Wozniak A.K. Baron B. England P. Ladant D. Calcium-induced folding and stabilization of the intrinsically disordered RTX domain of the CyaA toxin.Biophys. J. 2010; 99: 3744-3753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To explore the potential role of AC residues Arg338, Asn347, and Asp360 in CaM-induced activation, as suggested previously (15Selwa E. Laine E. Malliavin T. Differential role of calmodulin and calcium ions in the stabilization of the catalytic domain of adenyl cyclase CyaA from Bordetella pertussis.Proteins. 2012; 80: 1028-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we first checked the conservation of the atomic contacts established by these residues in the crystallographic structures of the AC·C-CaM complex (13Guo Q. Shen Y. Lee Y.S. Gibbs C.S. Mrksich M. Tang W.J. Structural basis for the interaction of Bordetella pertussis adenylyl cyclase toxin with calmodulin.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3190-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The analysis of the hydrogen bonds and water-mediated contacts established between C-CaM and AC residues showed that the residues Arg338 and Asp360 were often involved in hydrogen bonds or in water-mediated contacts with C-CaM (data not shown; available on request). Furthermore, most of the contacts and hydrogen bonds between the LHL motif (residues 338–360) (Fig. 1c) and other AC residues were present in more than three crystallographic structures (data not shown; available on request), thereby suggesting that the LHL motif plays an important role in the stabilization of the AC structure. Six independent MD simulations were recorded using the AC·C-CaM complex, where AC was modified in three different ways. Two simulations (i.e. “T1” and “T2”) were performed for each AC variant, ACm1A (N347A), ACm2A (R338A/D360A), and ACm3A (R338A/N347A/D360A) (Fig. 1b). The aim of these simulations was to analyze the relative stability of the different ACm·C-CaM complexes and to relate these to the observations described previously based on the x-ray crystallographic str"
https://openalex.org/W1985174657,"Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various cardiovascular diseases. CRIF1 is a protein present in the mitochondria associated with large mitoribosomal subunits, and CRIF1 knockdown induces mitochondrial dysfunction and promotes ROS production. p66shc is a redox enzyme implicated in mitochondrial ROS generation and translation of oxidative signals and, therefore, is a key factor for oxidative stress in endothelial cells. In this study, we investigated whether mitochondrial dysfunction induced by CRIF1 knockdown induces p66shc stimulation and plays any role in mitochondrial dysfunction-induced endothelial activation. Knockdown of CRIF1 decreased the expression of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes I, III and IV, leading to increased mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) and hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Knockdown of CRIF1 also stimulated phosphorylation of p66shc and increased cytosolic ROS in endothelial cells. Furthermore, the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and endoplasmic reticulum stress proteins were increased upon CRIF1 knockdown in endothelial cells. However, p66shc knockdown blunted the alteration in mitochondrial dynamics and ROS production in CRIF1 knockdown endothelial cells. In addition, p66shc knockdown reduced the CRIF1 knockdown-induced increases in adhesion between monocytes and endothelial cells. Taken together, these results suggest that CRIF1 knockdown partially induces endothelial activation via increased ROS production and phosphorylation of p66shc."
https://openalex.org/W2068900946,"The main objectives of the study were to determine the exposure and bioavailability of oral propranolol and to investigate their associations with serum bile acid concentration in patients with liver cirrhosis and in healthy controls. A further objective was to study the pharmacodynamics of propranolol. An open-label crossover study was performed to determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of propranolol after oral (40 mg) and intravenous (1 mg) administration as well as the concentration of total and individual fasting serum bile acids in 15 patients with liver cirrhosis and 5 healthy controls. After intravenous propranolol, patients showed a 1.8-fold increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0–∞), a 1.8-fold increase in volume of distribution and a 3-fold increase in the elimination half-life (mean ± SEM: 641±100 vs. 205±43 minutes) compared to controls. After oral application, AUC0–∞ and elimination half-life of propranolol were increased 6- and 4-fold, respectively, and bioavailability 3-fold (83±8 vs. 27±9.2%). Maximal effects on blood pressure and heart rate occurred during the first 4 and first 2 hours, respectively, after intravenous and oral application in both patients and controls. Total serum bile acid concentrations were higher in patients than controls (42±11 vs. 2.7±0.3 µmol/L) and were linearly correlated with the serum chenodeoxycholic acid concentration. There was a linear correlation between the SBA concentration and propranolol oral AUC0–∞ in subjects not receiving interacting drugs (r2 = 0.73, n = 18). The bioavailability of and exposure to oral propranolol are increased in patients with cirrhosis. Fasting serum bile acid concentration may be helpful in predicting the exposure to oral propranolol in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2158418062,"The measurement of the Critical Flicker Frequency threshold is used to study the visual temporal resolution in healthy subjects and in pathological conditions. To better understand the role played by different cortical areas in the Critical Flicker Frequency threshold perception we used continuous Theta Burst Stimulation (cTBS), an inhibitory plasticity-inducing protocol based on repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. The Critical Flicker Frequency threshold was measured in twelve healthy subjects before and after cTBS applied over different cortical areas in separate sessions. cTBS over the left inferior parietal lobule altered the Critical Flicker Frequency threshold, whereas cTBS over the left mediotemporal cortex, primary visual cortex and right inferior parietal lobule left the Critical Flicker Frequency threshold unchanged. No statistical difference was found when the red or blue lights were used. Our findings show that left inferior parietal lobule is causally involved in the conscious perception of Critical Flicker Frequency and that Critical Flicker Frequency threshold can be modulated by plasticity-inducing protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2064647109,"Liriomyza sativae and L. trifolii (Diptera: Agromyzidae) are two highly invasive species of leafmining flies, which have become established as pests of horticultural crops throughout the world. In certain regions where both species have been introduced, L. sativae has displaced L. trifolii, whereas the opposite has occurred in other regions. These opposing outcomes suggest that neither species is an inherently superior competitor. The regions where these displacements have been observed (southern China, Japan and western USA) are climatically different. We determined whether temperature differentially affects the reproductive success of these species and therefore if climatic differences could affect the outcome of interspecific interactions where these species are sympatric. The results of life table parameters indicate that both species can develop successfully at all tested temperatures (20, 25, 31, 33°C). L. sativae had consistently higher fecundities at all temperatures, but L. trifolii developed to reproductive age faster. Age-stage specific survival rates were higher for L. sativae at low temperatures, but these were higher for L. trifolii at higher temperatures. We then compared the net reproductive rates (R0) for both species in pure and mixed cultures maintained at the same four constant temperatures. Both species had significantly lower net reproductive rates in mixed species cultures compared with their respective pure species cultures, indicating that both species are subject to intense interspecific competition. Net reproductive rates were significantly greater for L. sativae than for L. trifolii in mixed species groups at the lower temperatures, whereas the opposite occurred at the higher temperature. Therefore, interactions between the species are temperature dependent and small differences could shift the competitive balance between the species. These temperature mediated effects may contribute to the current ongoing displacement of L. sativae by the more recent invader L. trifolii in warm climatic areas of China."
https://openalex.org/W1977583687,"Specialization in plant–insect interactions is an important driver of evolutionary divergence; yet, plant traits mediating such interactions are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how flower color and floral scent are related to seed predation by a seed-eating pollinator. We used field-transplanted recombinant F2 hybrids between Silene latifolia and S. dioica that are the preferred and alternative hosts of the moth Hadena bicruris and crosses within these species for comparison. We scored seed predation and flower color and analyzed floral scent. Pinker S. dioica-like flowers and emission of α-pinene decreased the odds of seed predation while emission of benzyl acetate and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one increased the odds of seed predation. Emission of these compounds did not differ significantly between the two Silene species. Our results suggest that flower color plays an important role in the specific interaction of H. bicruris with its preferred host S. latifolia. The compounds α-pinene, benzyl acetate and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one could represent non-specific deterrents and attractants to ovipositing moths. Alternatively, emission of these compounds could be related to herbivory or pathogen attack and act as a signal for host quality. This would weaken the predictability of the plant's costs and benefits of the interaction and act to maintain an imperfect degree of specialization."
https://openalex.org/W2062207918,"Peptidases are ubiquitous enzymes involved in diverse biological processes. Fragments from bioactive peptides have been found in skin secretions from frogs, and their presence suggests processing by peptidases. Thus, the aim of this work was to characterize the peptidase activity present in the skin secretion of Leptodactylus labyrinthicus. Zymography revealed the presence of three bands of gelatinase activity of approximately 60 kDa, 66 kDa, and 80 kDa, which the first two were calcium-dependent. These three bands were inhibited either by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and phenathroline; thus, they were characterized as metallopeptidases. Furthermore, the proteolytic enzymes identified were active only at pH 6.0–10.0, and their activity increased in the presence of CHAPS or NaCl. Experiments with fluorogenic substrates incubated with skin secretions identified aminopeptidase activity, with cleavage after leucine, proline, and alanine residues. This activity was directly proportional to the protein concentration, and it was inhibited in the presence of metallo and serine peptidase inhibitors. Besides, the optimal pH for substrate cleavage was determined to be 7.0–8.0. The results of the in gel activity assay showed that all substrates were hydrolyzed by a 45 kDa peptidase. Gly-Pro-AMC was also cleaved by a peptidase greater than 97 kDa. The data suggest the presence of dipeptidyl peptidases (DPPs) and metallopeptidases; however, further research is necessary. In conclusion, our work will help to elucidate the implication of these enzymatic activities in the processing of the bioactive peptides present in frog venom, expanding the knowledge of amphibian biology."
https://openalex.org/W2034269481,"Myxococcus xanthus responds to amino acid limitation by producing fruiting bodies containing dormant spores. During development, cells produce triacylglycerides in lipid bodies that become consumed during spore maturation. As the cells are starved to induce development, the production of triglycerides represents a counterintuitive metabolic switch. In this paper, lipid bodies were quantified in wild-type strain DK1622 and 33 developmental mutants at the cellular level by measuring the cross sectional area of the cell stained with the lipophilic dye Nile red. We provide five lines of evidence that triacylglycerides are derived from membrane phospholipids as cells shorten in length and then differentiate into myxospores. First, in wild type cells, lipid bodies appear early in development and their size increases concurrent with an 87% decline in membrane surface area. Second, developmental mutants blocked at different stages of shortening and differentiation accumulated lipid bodies proportionate with their cell length with a Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.76. Third, peripheral rods, developing cells that do not produce lipid bodies, fail to shorten. Fourth, genes for fatty acid synthesis are down-regulated while genes for fatty acid degradation are up regulated. Finally, direct movement of fatty acids from membrane lipids in growing cells to lipid bodies in developing cells was observed by pulse labeling cells with palmitate. Recycling of lipids released by Programmed Cell Death appears not to be necessary for lipid body production as a fadL mutant was defective in fatty acid uptake but proficient in lipid body production. The lipid body regulon involves many developmental genes that are not specifically involved in fatty acid synthesis or degradation. MazF RNA interferase and its target, enhancer-binding protein Nla6, appear to negatively regulate cell shortening and TAG accumulation whereas most cell-cell signals activate these processes."
https://openalex.org/W2005846896,"Since the late 1950s, land reclamation from lakes has been a common human disturbance to ecosystems in China. It has greatly diminished the lake area, and altered natural ecological succession. However, little is known about its impact on the carbon (C) cycle. We conducted an experiment to examine the variations of chemical properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and C mineralization under four land uses, i.e. coniferous forest (CF), evergreen broadleaf forest (EBF), bamboo forest (BF) and cropland (CL) in a reclaimed land area from Taihu Lake. Soils and lake sediments (LS) were incubated for 360 days in the laboratory and the CO2 evolution from each soil during the incubation was fit to a double exponential model. The DOM was analyzed at the beginning and end of the incubation using UV and fluorescence spectroscopy to understand the relationships between DOM chemistry and C mineralization. The C mineralization in our study was influenced by the land use with different vegetation and management. The greatest cumulative CO2-C emission was observed in BF soil at 0–10 cm depth. The active C pool in EBF at 10–25 cm had longer (62 days) mean residence time (MRT). LS showed the highest cumulative CO2-C and shortest MRT comparing with the terrestrial soils. The carbohydrates in DOM were positively correlated with CO2-C evolution and negatively correlated to phenols in the forest soils. Cropland was consistently an outlier in relationships between DOM chemistry and CO2-evolution, highlighting the unique effects that this land use on soil C cycling, which may be attributed the tillage practices. Our results suggest that C mineralization is closely related to the chemical composition of DOM and sensitive to its variation. Conversion of an aquatic ecosystem into a terrestrial ecosystem may alter the chemical structure of DOM, and then influences soil C mineralization."

Podoplanin (Pdpn) is a small, transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on the surface of lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC). During mouse development, binding of Pdpn to the C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) on platelets is critical for the separation of the lymphatic and blood vascular systems. Competitive inhibition of Pdpn functions with a soluble form of the protein, Pdpn-Fc, leads to reduced lymphangiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. However, the transgenic overexpression of human Pdpn-Fc in mouse skin causes disseminated intravascular coagulation due to platelet activation via CLEC-2. In the present study, we produced and characterized a mutant form of mouse Pdpn-Fc, in which threonine 34, which is considered essential for CLEC-2 binding, was mutated to alanine (PdpnT34A-Fc). Indeed, PdpnT34A-Fc displayed a 30-fold reduced binding affinity for CLEC-2 compared with Pdpn-Fc. This also translated into fewer side effects due to platelet activation in vivo. Mice showed less prolonged bleeding time and fewer embolized vessels in the liver, when PdpnT34A-Fc was injected intravenously. However, PdpnT34A-Fc was still as active as wild-type Pdpn-Fc in inhibiting lymphangiogenesis in vitro and also inhibited lymphangiogenesis in vivo. These data suggest that the function of Pdpn in lymphangiogenesis does not depend on threonine 34 in the CLEC-2 binding domain and that PdpnT34A-Fc might be an improved inhibitor of lymphangiogenesis with fewer toxic side effects.

https://openalex.org/W2047428843,"Functional connectivity has become an increasingly important area of research in recent years. At a typical spatial resolution, approximately 300 million connections link each voxel in the brain with every other. This pattern of connectivity is known as the functional connectome. Connectivity is often compared between experimental groups and conditions. Standard methods used to control the type 1 error rate are likely to be insensitive when comparisons are carried out across the whole connectome, due to the huge number of statistical tests involved. To address this problem, two new cluster based methods – the cluster size statistic (CSS) and cluster mass statistic (CMS) – are introduced to control the family wise error rate across all connectivity values. These methods operate within a statistical framework similar to the cluster based methods used in conventional task based fMRI. Both methods are data driven, permutation based and require minimal statistical assumptions. Here, the performance of each procedure is evaluated in a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis, utilising a simulated dataset. The relative sensitivity of each method is also tested on real data: BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) fMRI scans were carried out on twelve subjects under normal conditions and during the hypercapnic state (induced through the inhalation of 6% CO2 in 21% O2 and 73%N2). Both CSS and CMS detected significant changes in connectivity between normal and hypercapnic states. A family wise error correction carried out at the individual connection level exhibited no significant changes in connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2058096611,"Background/Aim Majority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) belonged to Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) class A. We aimed to identify a new class of patients with very well-preserved liver function and analyze its impact on outcome prediction, tumor staging and treatment allocation. Methods A total of 2654 HCC patients were retrospectively analyzed. The prognostic ability was compared by the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Results The CTP class 0 was defined by fulfilling all criteria of albumin ≧4 g/dL, bilirubin ≦0.8 mg/dL, prothrombin time prolongation <0 seconds, no ascites and encephalopathy. A total of 23% of patients of CTP class A were reclassified as CTP class 0. Patients with CTP class 0 had a higher serum sodium level, lower serum creatinine, alanine aminotransferase, α-fetoprotein levels, shorter prothrombin time, better general well-being, smaller tumor burden with more solitary nodules, lower rates of vascular invasion, ascites formation, hepatic encephalopathy, more frequently treated with curative interventions and better Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages (all p<0.001). In the Cox proportional hazards model, the adjusted hazard ratios for CTP class A, B and C were 1.739, 3.120 and 5.107, respectively, compared to class 0 (all p<0.001). Reassigning patients with CTP class 0, A, B, B and C to stage 0, A, B, C and D, respectively, provided the lowest AIC score among all BCLC-based models. Conclusions The proposal of CTP class 0 independently predicted better survival in HCC patients. Modification of tumor staging systems according to the modified CTP classification further enhances their prognostic ability."
https://openalex.org/W2017431527,"To evaluate how often delayed images, obtained during neurovascular CTA, provide unique information relative to early phase imaging alone.Informed consent was waived by the institutional review body for this study. Neurovascular CTAs from January through June 2009 were searched to identify those with delayed phase imaging. Reports were reviewed to identify cases where delayed images provided potentially unique information. The studies with potentially unique information were re-interpreted to determine if the information was indeed unique.645 CTAs with delayed phase imaging were identified. There were 324 men and 310 women (median age 67 years; range 20-96 years). 59 studies (59/645: 9.1%) had findings on the delayed images. There were 13 cases with hemorrhage, with 4 showing progression on delayed views. Of the remaining 46 cases, 28 had occlusion of a vessel that did not reconstitute on the delayed images, 6 had occlusion of a vessel that did reconstitute on the delayed images, 7 had a string sign which was unchanged on the delayed views and 5 had no abnormal findings. Thus in 10 cases the findings were unique to the delayed images (10/645: 1.55%). Four showed active bleeding, three showed proximal occlusion with distal internal carotid filling from ophthalmic collaterals, two showed pial vessels filling distal to proximal MCA occlusion, and one showed retrograde vertebral artery filling due to subclavian steal. 95% confidence limits of the expected incidence of unique information from the delayed phase images are 0.6%-2.5%.Obtaining delayed phase imaging for neurovascular CTA should be an active decision and not the default protocol. This avoids imaging with little, if any value. If delayed images had not been obtained in our cohort, no detriment in patient management would have occurred."
https://openalex.org/W2053955133,"Background There has still been lack of evidence for definite imaging criteria of intra-arterial revascularization (IAR). Therefore, IAR selection is left largely to individual clinicians. In this study, we sought to investigate the overall agreement of IAR selection among different stroke clinicians and factors associated with good agreement of IAR selection. Methods From the prospectively registered data base of a tertiary hospital, we identified consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke. IAR selection based on the provided magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results and clinical information were independently performed by 5 independent stroke physicians currently working at 4 different university hospitals. MRI results were also reviewed by 2 independent experienced neurologists blinded to clinical data and physicians' IAR selection. The Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS) was calculated on initial DWI and MTT. We arbitrarily used ASPECTS differences between DWI and MTT (D-M ASPECTS) to quantitatively evaluate mismatch. Results The overall interobserver agreement of IAR selection was fair (kappa = 0.398). In patients with DWI-ASPECTS >6, interobserver agreement was moderate to substantial (0.398–0.620). In patients with D-M ASPECTS >4, interobserver agreement was moderate to almost perfect (0.532–1.000). Patients with higher DWI or D-M ASPECTS had better agreement of IAR selection. Conclusion Our study showed that DWI-ASPSECTS >6 and D-M ASPECTS >4 had moderate to substantial agreement of IAR selection among different stroke physicians. However, there is still poor agreement as to whether IAR should not be performed in patients with lower DWI and D-M ASPECTS."
