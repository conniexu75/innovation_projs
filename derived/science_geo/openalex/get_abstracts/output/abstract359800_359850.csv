https://openalex.org/W1967798906,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induces INS-1 cell apoptosis by a pathway involving Ca2+-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2β)-mediated ceramide generation, but the mechanism by which iPLA2β and ceramides contribute to apoptosis is not well understood. We report here that both caspase-12 and caspase-3 are activated in INS-1 cells following induction of ER stress with thapsigargin, but only caspase-3 cleavage is amplified in iPLA2β overexpressing INS-1 cells (OE), relative to empty vector-transfected cells, and is suppressed by iPLA2β inhibition. ER stress also led to the release of cytochrome c and Smac and, unexpectedly, their accumulation in the cytosol is amplified in OE cells. These findings raise the likelihood that iPLA2β participates in ER stress-induced apoptosis by activating the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Consistent with this possibility, we find that ER stress promotes iPLA2β accumulation in the mitochondria, opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore, and loss in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) in INS-1 cells and that these changes are amplified in OE cells. ER stress also led to greater ceramide generation in ER and mitochondria fractions of OE cells. Exposure to ceramide alone induces loss in ΔΨ and apoptosis and these are suppressed by forskolin. ER stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis are also inhibited by forskolin, as well as by inactivation of iPLA2β or NSMase, suggesting that iPLA2β-mediated generation of ceramides via sphingomyelin hydrolysis during ER stress affect the mitochondria. In support, inhibition of iPLA2β or NSMase prevents cytochrome c release. Collectively, our findings indicate that the iPLA2β-ceramide axis plays a critical role in activating the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in insulin-secreting cells during ER stress."

A rapid and effective mechanism for regulating V-ATPase activity involves reversible dissociation of the two functional domains of the pump, V1 and V0. This process is best characterized in yeast, where V-ATPases are reversibly disassembled in response to glucose depletion. To identify regulators that control this process in vivo, a genetic screen was performed in yeast to search for mutants that cannot disassemble their V-ATPases when grown in the absence of glucose. This screen identified IRA1 (inhibitory regulator of the Ras/cAMP pathway 1) and IRA2 as essential genes for regulating V-ATPase dissociation in vivo. IRA1 and IRA2 encode GTPase-activating proteins that negatively regulate Ras in nutrient-poor conditions. Down-regulation of Ras lowers cAMP levels by reducing adenylate cyclase activity. Decreased cAMP levels in turn lead to reduced activity of protein kinase A (PKA). Our results show that targeted deletion of IRA2 results in defective disassembly of the V-ATPase in response to glucose depletion, and reexpression of the gene rescues this phenotype. Glucose-dependent dissociation is also blocked in strains expressing the dominant active RAS2val19 allele or in strains deficient for the regulatory subunit of PKA, both of which lead to constitutively active PKA. These results reveal a role for PKA in controlling glucose-dependent V-ATPase assembly in yeast.

In all eukaryotic cells, they are located on the membranes of endosomes, secretory vesicles, Golgi, and lysosomes (or vacuoles in plants and fungi), where they pump protons from the cytosol into the lumen of these organelles. The pH gradients established and maintained by V-ATPases are important for a variety of physiological processes, including coupled transport of small molecules, such as neurotransmitters (3Henry J.P.

Bond S. Forgac M. Pflugers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Entry of enveloped viruses, such as influenza virus, or bacterial toxins, such as diphtheria or anthrax toxin, is also dependent on acidification of intracellular compartments by V-ATPases (7Gruenberg J. van der Goot F.G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 7: 495-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). V-ATPases are also localized to the plasma membrane of certain cells, where they pump protons from the cytosol into the extracellular space. This activity is essential for normal physiological processes, such as acid/base balance by renal cells (8Wagner C.A. Finberg K.E. Breton S. Marshansky V. Brown D. Geibel J.P. Physiol.

Certain types of cancer cells also target V-ATPases to the plasma membrane, and expression of surface V-ATPases correlates with a metastatic phenotype (14Martinez-Zaguilan R. Lynch R.M. Martinez G.M.

Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 2Kane P.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The V1 domain is located in the cytosol and carries out ATP hydrolysis, whereas the V0 domain is membrane-bound and responsible for proton translocation across the lipid bilayer. The V1 domain is a 650-kDa complex composed of eight different subunits (A–H) present in one or more copies. In mammals, the V0 domain is a 260-kDa complex composed of five different subunits (a, c, c″, d, and e) present in single copies with the exception of c, which is present in multiple copies (1Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 917-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 16Powell B. Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23654-23660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Yeast express an additional subunit (c′) homologous to the c subunit (17Hirata R. Graham L.A. Takatsuki A. Stevens T.H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4795-4803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and mammalian V0 domains sometimes contain an accessory subunit known as Ac45 (18Supek F. Supekova L. Mandiyan S. Pan Y.C. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24102-24106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). V-ATPase activity is tightly controlled. Regulating V-ATPase activity allows cells to maintain organelles at a specific pH as well as increase or decrease proton flux across particular membranes in response to specific stimuli. One primary mechanism for regulating V-ATPase activity is reversible dissociation, which involves the physical separation or assembly of the V1 and V0 domains (2Kane P.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 19Beyenbach K.W. Wieczorek H. J. Exp. Biol. 2006; 209: 577-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). This mechanism is a rapid and effective way to reduce or increase proton pumping activity and has been observed in several different organisms, including mammals, insects, and yeast. In dendritic cells of the immune system, V1 domains will assemble with V0 domains in response to maturation signals, allowing the pump to acidify organelles that function in antigen processing (20Trombetta E.S. Ebersold M. Garrett W. Pypaert M. Mellman I. Science. 2003; 299: 1400-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Cultured kidney cells respond to increased glucose concentrations by assembling V1 with V0 in a manner that requires phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity (21Sautin Y.Y. Lu M. Gaugler A. Zhang L. Gluck S.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 575-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). V-ATPase assembly is modulated during development in the tobacco hornworm gut (22Sumner J.P. Dow J.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5649-5653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), whereas in blowfly salivary gland epithelial cells, cAMP triggers assembly and proton pumping through a mechanism that may involve phosphorylation of the V1 C subunit by protein kinase A (PKA) (23Dames P.

V-ATPase regulation by reversible dissociation is best characterized in yeast (2Kane P.M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Here, V-ATPases are disassembled in response to glucose depletion and reassembled when glucose (or another rapidly fermented carbon source) is added back to the media (25Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17025-17032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This process occurs within minutes, does not require new protein synthesis, and is not affected by disruption of the major signaling pathways known to respond to nutritional changes (26Parra K.J. Kane P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7064-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the glycolytic enzyme aldolase binds V-ATPase subunits and may play a role in stabilizing the assembled pump (27Lu M. Holliday L.S. Zhang L. Dunn Jr., W.A. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30407-30413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 28Lu M. Sautin Y.Y. Holliday L.S. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8732-8739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Point mutations in aldolase that disrupt its interaction with the V-ATPase without affecting glycolytic activity result in a disassembled pump, and overexpressing aldolase blocks V-ATPase dissociation upon glucose removal (29Lu M. Ammar D. Ives H. Albrecht F. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24495-24503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It also appears that assembly and disassembly are independently controlled processes, because intact microtubules are required for disassembly but not reassembly (30Xu T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24855-24861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and a heterotrimeric complex known as RAVE functions in assembly but not disassembly (31Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 32Smardon A.M. Tarsio M. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13831-13839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although reversible dissociation has been well studied in yeast, it is not known how signals regarding nutritional state are transmitted to the V-ATPase to regulate its assembly. In an effort to understand how V-ATPase activity is controlled in cells in response to stimuli, we performed a genetic screen in yeast to identify gene products required for down-regulating V-ATPase activity through disassembly of the V1 and V0 domains. Because assembly or disassembly occurs rapidly and in response to specific stimuli, we hypothesized that a signaling molecule or pathway controls this process. This screen identified the Ras GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) IRA1 and IRA2 as essential factors for regulating V-ATPase disassembly in yeast in response to glucose depletion. We show that expressing the dominant active RAS2val19 allele or deleting the PKA regulatory subunit BCY1 results in a similar phenotype, suggesting that PKA mediates the effects of Ras on V-ATPase assembly.

Yeast were transformed with NotI-digested library DNA, and the resulting mutants were selected on -leucine, 2% raffinose plates and analyzed visually for red color. Approximately 30,000 mutants were screened, and 104 mutants that appeared red were selected, subcloned, and preserved as frozen stocks.

Yeast genomic DNA was isolated, digested with EcoRI, ligated, and transformed into Escherichia coli. Recovered plasmids were sequenced using a primer specific for a sequence in the insertion, 5′-GCTGCAAGGCGATTAAGTTGG-3′. Glucose-dependent Dissociation—Yeast cells were grown in selection media to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.75–0.9, and then two or three aliquots of yeast cells equivalent to 10 optical density units were taken for the assay. Yeast were converted to spheroplasts by incubating in Tris/DTT buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.4, 10 mm DTT) for 10 min at 30 °C, rinsing once in Spheroplast buffer (YPD with 0.1 m MES-Tris, pH 7.5, 0.7 m sorbitol, 2 mm DTT), and then incubating in Spheroplast buffer containing 0.3 mg of Zymolyase 100T for 40 min at 30 °C. Yeast were then rinsed twice in YPD/0.7 m sorbitol (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 2% glucose, 0.7 m sorbitol) or YEP/1.2 m sorbitol (1% yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 1.2 m sorbitol) and then incubated in YPD/0.7 m sorbitol or YEP/1.2 m sorbitol for 30 min. For reassociation experiments, yeast were incubated in YEP/1.2 m sorbitol for 30 min followed by YPD/0.7 m sorbitol for 30 min. Yeast were then lysed in Lysis buffer (1× PBS, pH 7.4, 1% polyoxyethylene 9-lauryl ether, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and cell lysate was then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in Lysis buffer containing 25 mm dithiobis(succinimidyl)propionate, precleared with Protein A-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C, and then incubated with the monoclonal antibody 8B1 (anti-A) at 1:500 overnight at 4 °C. Antibodies and bound protein were isolated with Protein A-Sepharose and separated by SDS-PAGE. After transferring proteins to nitrocellulose, Western blotting was performed using monoclonal antibodies 10D7 (anti-a) and 8B1 (anti-A). Antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescent detection reagents. Isolation of Vacuolar Membrane Vesicles—Vacuolar membrane vesicles were isolated as described in our previous study (40Inoue T. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27896-27903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 liter of yeast cells was grown overnight at 30 °C to an absorbance at 600 nm of 1.2–1.4 in selective media, rinsed once with water, and then converted to spheroplasts by incubating in Tris/DTT buffer for 20 min at 30 °C, rinsing once in Spheroplast buffer, and then incubating in Spheroplast buffer containing 2 mg of Zymolyase 100T for 60–90 min at 30 °C. The resulting spheroplasts were osmotically lysed, and vacuolar membranes were isolated by centrifugation on two consecutive Ficoll gradients (12 and 8%) and diluted in transport buffer (15 mm MES-Tris, pH 7, 4.8% glycerol). Other Methods—Protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method (41Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured using a continuous spectrophotometric assay in the presence or absence of 1 μm concanamycin A (42Forgac M. Cantley L. Wiedenmann B. Altstiel L. Branton D. Proc. Natl.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 644-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). 3 μg of vacuolar membrane vesicles were diluted into assay mixture containing 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm ATP, 2 mm MgSO4, 1.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.25 mg/ml NADH, 20 μg/ml pyruvate kinase, and 20 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and the absorbance change at 340 nm was measured at 30 °C. Proton transport was measured by ATP-dependent fluorescence quenching of 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine in the presence or absence of 1 μm concanamycin A using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-5 spectrofluorometer (44Arai H. Berne M. Terres G. Terres H. Puopolo K. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6632-6638Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). 3 μg of vacuolar membrane vesicles were diluted into assay mixture containing 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, and 1 μm 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine. Fluorescence quenching was measured following the addition of 1 mm ATP and 2 mm MgSO4. Yeast Genetic Screen to Identify V-ATPase Regulators—To identify factors involved in V-ATPase dissociation in vivo, a genetic screen was performed in yeast to look for mutants that cannot dissociate their V-ATPases in response to glucose depletion. To perform the initial screen, we used the adenine-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YPH500, which produces a red pigment derived from an intermediate in adenine biosynthesis. In cells containing a functional V-ATPase, this pigment accumulates in the acidic vacuole, turning the colony red. By contrast, in cells lacking functional V-ATPase, no pigment accumulates in the vacuole, and the colony appears white. Because glucose promotes V-ATPase assembly in yeast, YPH500 colonies normally appear red when plated on glucose. When V-ATPases are triggered to disassemble by plating on poorly fermented carbon sources, such as raffinose, the red pigment does not accumulate, and the colonies appear white (Fig. 1A). We used this property to screen for mutants that could not disassemble their V-ATPases in nutrient-poor conditions, because such mutants would appear red on raffinose plates. To perform the screen, a transposon library (39Burns N. Grimwade B. Ross-Macdonald P.B. Choi E.Y. Finberg K. Roeder G.S. Snyder M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1087-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) was used to mutagenize the YPH500 genome, followed by plating of mutant cells on raffinose and selection of colonies that appeared red. From 30,000 colonies screened, 104 mutant colonies were isolated and confirmed as remaining red on raffinose plates. Mutants that were positive by this initial screen were then tested using a secondary screen designed to directly measure V-ATPase assembly in response to glucose depletion. The yeast cell wall was removed, and the resulting spheroplasts were cultured in the presence or absence of glucose and then lysed. An antibody directed against the A subunit of the V1 domain was used to immunoprecipitate both the V1 domain and the V1V0 holoenzyme (Fig. 1B). The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed using antibodies directed against subunit a (as a measure of the amount of V0 immunoprecipitated) and subunit A (as a measure of the amount of V1). Dissociation appears as a reduction in the amount of V0 immunoprecipitated with V1. Mutants that did not show a decrease in assembly of the V-ATPase in response to glucose removal were scored as being defective in in vivo dissociation. Of the 104 mutants isolated in the initial screen, 57 have been tested using the secondary screen. Of these, nine mutants showed defective dissociation in this assay. IRA2 Is Required for V-ATPase Regulation by Disassembly—One mutant identified twice in the primary screen and confirmed using the secondary screen is disrupted in the IRA2 gene. Ira2p is a Ras GAP that stimulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras proteins to convert them from the active, GTP-bound form to the inactive, GDP-bound form (45Tanaka K. Lin B.K. Wood D.R. Tamanoi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 46Tanaka K. Nakafuku M. Satoh T. Marshall M.S. Gibbs J.B. Matsumoto K. Kaziro Y. Toh-e A.

Biol. 1990; 10: 4303-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, GTP-bound Ras activates adenylate cyclase, leading to increased cAMP levels and PKA activity (48Thevelein J.M. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1753-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). This pathway is stimulated by glucose and is inactive in nutrient-poor conditions, the same stimuli that affect V-ATPase activity. ira2Δ mutants display a similar phenotype to mutants with overactive Ras, such as those expressing the dominant active RAS2val19 allele (47Tanaka K. Nakafuku M. Tamanoi F. Kaziro Y. Matsumoto K. Toh-e A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4303-4313Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). To confirm that IRA2 is required for V-ATPase regulation, glucose-dependent dissociation was tested in a yeast strain in which the IRA2 gene had been replaced with the kanamycin resistance gene (34Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A. Liang H. Anderson K. Andre B. Bangham R. Benito R. Boeke J.D. Bussey H. Chu A.M. Connelly C. Davis K. Dietrich F. Dow S.W. El Bakkoury M. Foury F. Friend S.H. Gentalen E.

Science. 1999; 285: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (3181) Google Scholar). Although glucose removal triggered normal disassembly of the V1 domain from the V0 domain in the parental strain expressing wild type IRA2, the ira2Δ strain showed a dramatic reduction in V-ATPase regulation by disassembly (Fig. 2). Introduction of a plasmid containing the wild type IRA2 gene into the ira2Δ stain restored the wild type phenotype. We conclude from these results that IRA2 is essential for V-ATPase disassembly in yeast in response to glucose depletion. Loss of IRA2 Does Not Affect V-ATPase Stability or Activity—One possible way in which mutations could lead to reduced dissociation of the V-ATPase in response to glucose depletion is to increase the inherent stability of the V-ATPase complex. Certain point mutations in the G subunit of the yeast V-ATPase result in such increased stability and reduced dissociation following glucose removal (36Chars"

Using mass spectrometry we identified caspase-8 among proteins co-immunoprecipitating with Alix in dying neurons. We next demonstrated that Alix and ALG-2 interact with pro-caspase-8 and that Alix forms a complex with the TNFα receptor-1 (TNF-R1), depending on its capacity to bind ESCRT proteins. Thus, Alix and ALG-2 may allow the recruitment of pro-caspase-8 onto endosomes containing TNF-R1, a step thought to be necessary for activation of the apical caspase. In line with this, expression of Alix deleted of its ALG-2-binding site (AlixΔALG-2) significantly reduced TNF-R1-induced cell death, without affecting endocytosis of the receptor. In a more physiological setting, we found that programmed cell death of motoneurons, which can be inhibited by AlixΔALG-2, is regulated by TNF-R1. Taken together, these results highlight Alix and ALG-2 as new actors of the TNF-R1 pathway.

Endocytosis of cell surface receptors has long been described as an effective way of switching off extracellularly induced signals. Endocytosed activated receptors traffic through early endosomes and are sorted into intralumenal vesicles accumulating inside endosomes known as multivesicular bodies (MVBs). 5The abbreviations used are: MVB, multivesicular body; DD, death domain; DED, death effector domain; HH, Hamburger-Hamilton; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNF-R1, TNF receptor 1; TUNEL, terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling; HA, hemagglutinin; wt, wild type; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MTN, motoneurons; DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; CaRIPA, RIPA buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2; IP, immunoprecipitation; FADD, Fas-associated protein with death domain.5The abbreviations used are: MVB, multivesicular body; DD, death domain; DED, death effector domain; HH, Hamburger-Hamilton; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TNF-R1, TNF receptor 1; TUNEL, terminal transferase dUTP nick end labeling; HA, hemagglutinin; wt, wild type; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MTN, motoneurons; DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; CaRIPA, RIPA buffer containing 1 mm CaCl2; IP, immunoprecipitation; FADD, Fas-associated protein with death domain. These MVBs fuse with lysosomes where the receptors meet their end by acid hydrolysis (1.van der Goot F.G. Gruenberg J. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 514-521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar).In some cases however, such as for neurotrophin-bound Trk receptors, activated receptors continue signaling inside endosomes (2.Barker P.A. Hussain N.K. McPherson P.S. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 379-381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Also, in the case of death receptors, Schütze and co-workers (3.Schneider-Brachert W. Tchikov V. Neumeyer J. Jakob M. Winoto-Morbach S. Held-Feindt J. Heinrich M. Merkel O. Ehrenschwender M. Adam D. Mentlein R. Kabelitz D. Schütze S. Immunity. 2004; 21: 415-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) showed that endocytosis of TNF-R1, which occurs after binding to TNFα, is a necessary step for activation of caspases and consequently apoptosis. They found that the apical procaspase-8 is recruited and thereby activated on the surface of multivesicular endosomes containing activated TNF-R1.Biogenesis of MVBs is under tight control by a set of proteins, making the so-called ESCRT-0 to -III (endosomal sorting complex required for transport), which sequentially associate on the cytosolic surface of endosomes (4.Williams R.L. Urbe S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 8: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). A partner of ESCRT proteins, which also regulates the making of MVBs, is the protein Alix/AIP1, first characterized as an interactor of the calcium-binding protein ALG-2 (apoptosis-linked gene-2) (5.Missotten M. Nichols A. Rieger K. Sadoul R. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 6.Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L.

Enveloped viruses, like human immunodeficiency virus, type 1, use Alix to recruit the ESCRT machinery to deform membranes and allow fission during viral budding (8.Strack B. Calistri A. Craig S. Popova E. Gottlinger H.G. Cell. 2003; 114: 689-699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 9.von Schwedler U.K. Stuchell M. Muller B. Ward D.M. Chung H.Y. Morita E.

Furthermore, two recent reports have claimed that Alix together with ESCRT proteins might also be involved in the abscission stage of cytokinesis (10.Carlton J.G. Martin-Serrano J. Science. 2007; 316: 1908-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 11.Morita E. Sandrin V. Chung H.Y. Morham S.G. Gygi S.P. Rodesch C.K. Sundquist W.I. EMBO J. 2007; 13: 13Google Scholar).Besides Tsg101 and CHMP-4B of ESCRT-I and –III, respectively, Alix interacts with lysobisphosphatidic acid, a phospholipid involved in intralumenal vesiculation of endosomes (12.Matsuo H. Chevallier J. Mayran N. Le Blanc I. Ferguson C. Faure J. Blanc N.S. Matile S. Dubochet J. Sadoul R. Parton R.G. Vilbois F. Gruenberg J. Science. 2004; 303: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), and with regulators of endocytosis (CIN85 and endophilins) (13.Chatellard-Causse C. Blot B. Cristina N. Torch S. Missotten M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 19275-19281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of Alix on endosomes remains largely unclear because neither we nor other laboratories have found any striking effect of Alix on endocytosis and degradation of EGF or transferrin receptors (15.Cabezas A. Bache K.G. Brech A. Stenmark H. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2625-2635Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16.Schmidt M.H. Hoeller D. Yu J. Furnari F.B. Cavenee W.K. Dikic I. Bogler O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8981-8993Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).We and others have gathered evidence that Alix plays a role in cell death. In particular, expression of a mutant lacking the N-terminal part (Alix-CT) blocks death of HeLa cells induced by serum starvation (7.Vito P. Pellegrini L. Guiet C. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1533-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and of cerebellar neurons deprived of potassium (17.Trioulier Y. Torch S. Blot B. Cristina N. Chatellard-Causse C. Verna J.M. Sadoul R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2046-2052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this latter paradigm, Alix-CT, whose protecting activity was strictly correlated with its capacity to bind ALG-2, accumulated inside cytoplasmic aggregates together with ALG-2 and caspases. We also demonstrated, using electroporation in the chick embryo, that Alix mutants block programmed cell death of motoneurons during normal development, depending on binding to ALG-2 and ESCRT-I and -III. Our interpretation of these results is that some truncated forms of Alix behave as dominant negative mutants, blocking the formation of an ALG-2-Alix-ESCRT complex necessary for cell death (18.Mahul-Mellier A.-L. Hemming F.J. Blot B. Fraboulet S. Sadoul R. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore the Alix-ALG-2 complex could make a link between endosomes and a signaling or an execution step of neuronal death (19.Sadoul R. Biol. Cell. 2006; 98: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar).We have undertaken the present study to characterize this link and found that Alix and ALG-2 form a complex with endocytosed TNF-R1 and pro-caspase-8. The physiological relevance of these interactions was revealed by the demonstration that several Alix mutants inhibit TNF-R1-induced cell death both in vitro and in vivo.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—Human recombinant TNFα-FLAG was from Alexis Biochemicals (Covalab). Mouse monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody was from Cell Signaling (Ozyme); polyclonal antibodies against Myc, TNF-R1, and FADD were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; polyclonal antibodies against LAMP1 and EEA1 were from AbCam; anti-FLAG monoclonal (M1 and M2) and polyclonal antibodies were from Sigma-Aldrich; GM130 and monoclonal anti-AIP1/Alix were from BD Transduction; anti-ALG-2 was from Swant; HSP70 mitochondria was from Affinity Bioreagents (Ozyme); anti-caspase 8 was from Biovision (Clinisciences); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit Alexa594 antibody were from Jackson Laboratories; and biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody was from Vector Laboratories.DNA Constructs—For expression in the chick embryo, human TNF-R1 (wt or mutants), a catalytically dead version of human pro-caspase-8 (mutation C360A), and baculovirus p35 were inserted into the pCAGGS expression vector (a gift of Tsuyoshi Momose, Nara Institute of Science and Technology).

Maki (Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan).In Ovo Electroporation—Fertilized Isa Brown eggs (Société Française de Production Avicole, St. Marcellin, France) were electroporated at Hamburger-Hamilton (HH) stage 16. Plasmid DNA was electroporated as described in Ref. 18.Mahul-Mellier A.-L. Hemming F.J. Blot B. Fraboulet S. Sadoul R. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar.Histological Analysis—Chick embryos were collected 48 h after electroporation processed and cryo-sectioned as described previously in Ref. 18.Mahul-Mellier A.-L. Hemming F.J. Blot B. Fraboulet S. Sadoul R. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 542-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar.Immunohistochemistry and Immunofluorescence—Frozen sections were incubated with polyclonal anti-TNF-R1 or monoclonal anti-HA antibodies, diluted to 1/100 in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% GS, 0.02% saponine (TBSS) for 12–24 h at 4 °C. The sections were rinsed in TBSS and treated with a secondary anti-rabbit Alexa594 antibody or a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody, amplified using the ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) and revealed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and nickel intensification. The sections were rinsed in TBS, incubated 30 min at 37 °C in Hoechst 33342, 2 μg/ml (Sigma, France) before mounting in Mowiol (Calbiochem, France).Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-mediated dUTP-Biotin Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) Method—TUNEL analysis was performed using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Fluorescent positive cells were counted in every third section. Twelve sections/embryo were counted.Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA were extracted from whole chick embryo using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNAs were synthesized with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and controlled with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. TNF-R1 expression was further analyzed by amplification of a 695-nt fragment with the following oligonucleotides: 5′-GATACTGTGTGTGGCTGT-3′ and 5′-CGTAAATGTCGATGCTCC-3′ based on the chick TNF-R1 homologue (Gallus gallus accession number AJ720473).Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK-293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm glutamine, 10 μg/ml streptamycin, and 10 units/ml penicillin. BHK-21 cells were maintained in Glasgow minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 2.6 g/liter tryptose phosphate broth, 2 mm glutamine, 10 μg/ml streptamycin, and 10 units/ml penicillin. HEK 293 or BHK-21 cells were transfected using JetPEI (Ozyme).Alix Knockdown in BHK Cells—The Alix small hairpin RNA was cloned downstream of the human H1 promoter in the vector pSuperGFP (Oligoengine). The sequences of the synthetic oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) used for Alix small hairpin RNA construct were the following: 5′-GATCCCCGCCGCTGGTGAAGTTCATCTTCAAGAGAGATGAACTTCACCAGCGGCTTTTTGGAAA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTTTCCAAAAAGTTCATCCAGCAGACTTACTCTCTTGAAGTAAGTCTGCTGGATGAACGGG-3′. Annealed oligonucleotides were ligated into the BglII cleavage site within the pSuperGFP vector linearized with the same restriction enzymes.BHK cells were transfected with pSuper/shAlix plasmid or pSuperGFP vector for control using the JetSi transfection reagent (Polyplus Transfection). Transfected cells were selected using 800 μg/ml of G418. After 15 days, the clones were isolated and selected for the best reduction in Alix expression. Cells (pSuper/shAlix and control) were grown in the presence of 800 μg/ml of G418.Mass Spectrometry and Protein Identification—Cultures of mouse cerebellar granule neurons were prepared as described previously (17.Trioulier Y. Torch S. Blot B. Cristina N. Chatellard-Causse C. Verna J.M. Sadoul R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2046-2052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and cultured in basal medium Eagle containing 25 mm potassium. The medium was changed for basal medium Eagle containing 5 mm potassium, and the cells were lysed 4 h later in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Immunoprecipitations were performed using polyclonal anti-Alix antibody and protein G-coupled Sepharose beads. After separation by SDS-PAGE, discrete bands were excised from the Coomassie Blue-stained gel. In-gel digestion was performed as previously described (20.Ferro M. Seigneurin-Berny D. Rolland N. Chapel A. Salvi D. Garin J. Joyard J. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 3517-3526Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Gel pieces were then sequentially extracted with 5% (v/v) formic acid solution, 50% acetonitrile, 5% (v/v) formic acid, and acetonitrile. After drying, the tryptic peptides were resuspended in 0.5% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. For MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analyses, a 0.5-μl aliquot of peptide mixture was mixed with 0.5 μl of matrix solution (cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid at half-saturation in 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v)). The resulting solution was spotted on a MALDI-TOF target plate, dried, and rinsed with 2 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide mixtures were then analyzed with a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Autoflex, Bruker Daltonik, Germany) in reflector/delayed extraction mode over a mass range of 0–4200 Da. The spectra were annotated (XMass software), and the peptide mass fingerprints obtained were finally submitted to data base searches against the Swissprot Trembl data base with an intranet 1.9 version of MASCOT software.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Twenty-four hours after transfection, HEK-293 or BHK-21 cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. The cell lysates were cleared by a 14,000 × g centrifugation for 15 min and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-FLAG monoclonal M2 antibody. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and the beads were washed with RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5% milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween and incubated with the appropriate antibodies. The bands were revealed using the ECL detection reagent (Perbio).In the case of immunoprecipitation between endogenous Alix and TNF-R1, HeLa cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. The cell lysates were cleared by a 14,000 × g centrifugation for 15 min followed by two incubations of 30 min with protein G-Sepharose beads. The cell lysates containing 5 mg of total proteins were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the polyclonal antibody against TNF-R1. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and the beads were washed with RIPA buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and treated as described above. Alix was detected using the monoclonal anti-AIP1/Alix from BD Transduction Laboratories.Quantification of Cell Death Induced by TNF-R1—Twenty hours after transfection, HEK-293 were washed in PBS, pH 7.4, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 4 °C. The cells were stained with polyclonal anti-TNF-R1 antibody (1/100) and anti-rabbit Alexa594 antibody (1/500). The cells were rinsed in TBS, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 2 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Sigma), and mounted in Mowiol. Cell viability was scored on the basis of nuclear morphology, with condensed or fragmented nuclei being counted as dead.In some cases, tetrazolium salt 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) was added to cells at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Dimethyl sulfoxide was used to dissolve the formazan product, and absorbance was measured in each well at 540 nm, using a measure at 630 nm as reference, in a Biotek Elx-800 microplate reader (Mandel Scientific Inc.).TNFα Internalization—BHK cells co-expressing TNF-R1 and the indicated proteins were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 1 ng of 125I-labeled human recombinant TNFα (specific activity, 2160 kBq/μg) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The cells were then incubated at 37 °C to allow endocytosis for the indicated times. The amount of intracellular 125I-TNF receptor complexes formed at 37 °C was estimated after washing cells for 5 min in cold acetic acid buffer (200 mm acetic acid, 500 mm NaCl, pH 2.5). After two washes in PBS, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. Total amount of cell-associated 125I-TNFα was determined on cells, washed only with PBS, instead of the acetic acid buffer. The amount of internalized (pH 2.5 resistant) 125I-TNF was calculated as a percentage of 125I-TNF bound at pH 7.4.Magnetic Isolation of Endosomes Containing TNF-R1 Bound to TNFα—HEK 293 cells transfected with TNF-R1 and Alix-Myc were incubated in a total volume of 1 ml of cold D-PBS (0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.493 mm MgCl2, 2.67 mm KCl, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, 138 mm NaCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4) containing 3% bovine serum albumin, 100 ng/ml TNFα-FLAG, and 10 μg/ml anti-FLAG monoclonal M1 for 1 h at 4 °C. They were then washed twice in cold D-PBS and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C in 1 ml of cold D-PBS containing 50 μl of protein G microbeads (μMACS Protein G Microbeads, MACS Molecular, Miltenyi Biotec). The cells were then washed twice in cold D-PBS and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% SVF and kept at 4 °C or incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Removal of surface-bound M1 antibody was achieved by washing the cells three times for 5 min in cold PBS containing 1 mm EDTA. A post-nuclear supernatant was prepared in 8% sucrose supplemented in 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and 2× protease inhibitor mixture. The magnetic immune complex was passed over a column placed in the magnetic field of a MACS Separator. The labeled TNFα receptosome was retained within the column, whereas unbound material was washed away with 8% sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4. The magnetic fractions were collected by removing the column from the magnetic field and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Solubilization of endosomes was performed using a solution of 8% sucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, containing 0.5% Triton X-100.RESULTSAlix Interacts with Pro-caspase-8 through ALG-2—To understand how Alix might control cell death, we first characterized some of the proteins interacting with it during apoptosis. For this, we used cerebellar granule cells, which survive in absence of serum when cultured in high extracellular potassium (25 mm) but undergo apoptosis soon after they are incubated in a medium containing normal extracellular potassium concentrations (5 mm). We previously observed that expression of Alix-CT blocks caspase activation in neurons deprived of potassium (17.Trioulier Y. Torch S. Blot B. Cristina N. Chatellard-Causse C. Verna J.M. Sadoul R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2046-2052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We used a polyclonal anti-Alix antibody to immunoprecipitate the endogenous protein from cell lysates made from neurons incubated for 4 h in 5 mm potassium. Using peptide mass fingerprinting (see “Experimental Procedures”), we found caspase-8 among the proteins co-immunoprecipitated with Alix, suggesting that the protease may physically associate with Alix. We further showed that in BHK-21 cells, FLAG-tagged Alix (FLAG-Alix) and an HA-tagged, catalytically inactive version of pro-caspase-8 (HA-DN-pro-caspase-8) (Fig. 1) co-immunoprecipitated. This demonstrates that the two proteins exist in a complex and that activity of the caspase is not required for this interaction (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, deletion of the prodomain of pro-caspase-8 containing the two death effector domains (DEDs) abolished the capacity of the caspase to interact with Alix (Fig. 2B). The addition of 1 mm Ca2+ in the lysates strikingly enhanced the amount of Alix co-immunoprecipitating with pro-caspase-8 (Fig. 2A), and we detected endogenous ALG-2 in immunoprecipitates containing overexpressed Alix and pro-caspase-8 (Fig. 2C). This prompted us to test a potential interaction of pro-caspase-8 with ALG-2, whose binding to Alix depends on calcium. In the case where ALG-2 was co-expressed with DN-pro-caspase-8, ALG-2 co-immunoprecipitated with the caspase in presence of 1 mm CaCl2 (Fig. 3A). Here again, this interaction required the pro-domain of the caspase (Fig. 3B). FLAG-Alix deleted of the sequence 802PPYPTYPGYPGY813 necessary for the binding of ALG-2 (17.Trioulier Y. Torch S.

On the other hand, ALG-2 could be co-immunoprecipitated with DN-pro-caspase-8 equally well from lysates of wt BHK cells or from cells in which Alix expression had been down-regulated using a pSuper vector coding for an small hairpin RNA against Alix, indicating that ALG-2 can interact with pro-caspase-8 independently of Alix (Fig. 3D).FIGURE 2Alix co-immunoprecipitates with DN-pro-caspase-8.

First, we examined whether Alix and ALG-2 can form a complex with TNF-R1.These experiments were performed in HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with expression vectors coding for TNF-R1 and Alix. As reported (21.Todd I. Radford P.M. Draper-Morgan K.A. McIntosh R. Bainbridge S. Dickinson P. Jamhawi L. Sansaridis M. Huggins M.L. Tighe P.J. Powell R.J. Immunology. 2004; 113: 65-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), TNF-R1 overexpression was sufficient to induce apoptosis, even in the absence of TNFα. Western blot analysis of Alix or TNF-R1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4A and not shown) revealed the presence of TNF-R1 and Alix, respectively, suggesting the existence of a complex containing both proteins. We further proved the existence of such a complex by showing that endogenously expressed Alix is pulled down with endogenous TNF-R1 immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells (Fig. 4B). In HEK 293 cells, TNF-R1 mutant deleted of the death domain (TNF-R1ΔDD) (Fig. 1) did not co-immunoprecipitate with Alix, indicating that the interaction depends on the integrity of this region (Fig. 4C). AlixΔALG-2, which does not interact with pro-caspase-8, was capable of co-immunoprecipitating with TNF-R1 (Fig. 4C). This underscores the fact that binding of Alix to a TNF-R1 complex is independent of ALG-2 and of pro-caspase-8. Interestingly, Alix mutants lacking the Bro1 domain, required for interaction with CHMP-4B, or four amino acids necessary for binding to Tsg101, were not capable of co-precipitating with TNF-R1 (Fig. 4D). Thus, co-immunoprecipitation of Alix with TNF-R1 requires its ability to bind ESCRT proteins.FIGURE 4Alix co-immunoprecipitates with TNF-R1. A, Co-IP of overexpressed Alix and TNF-R1.

Here we show that several alternatively spliced receptor variants fail to do so efficiently because of splice-mediated removal of an endocytic sorting sequence that is present specifically in the MOR1 variant. All of the recycling-impaired receptor variants were found to undergo proteolytic down-regulation more rapidly than MOR1, irrespective of moderate differences in endocytic rate, indicating that alternative splicing plays a specific role in distinguishing the trafficking itinerary of receptors after endocytosis. The recycling-impaired MOR1B variant was similar to MOR1 in its ability to mediate opioid-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, and to undergo opioid-induced desensitization in intact cells. Functional recovery (resensitization) of MOR1B-mediated cellular responsiveness after opioid removal, however, was significantly impaired (4-fold reduction in rate) compared with MOR1. To our knowledge the present results are the first to establish a role of alternative RNA processing in specifying the post-endocytic sorting of G-protein-coupled receptors between divergent and functionally distinct membrane pathways.

Opioid receptors mediate the diverse physiological effects of endogenously produced opioid peptides, and are primary targets of a wide variety of therapeutic and abused drugs (1Evans C.J. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mu-type opioid receptors represent particularly important members of this family and, in the mouse, it is clear that all functional Mu opioid receptors are encoded by a single structural gene (Oprm1) (2Matthes H.W. Maldonado R. Simonin F. Valverde O. Slowe S. Kitchen I. Befort K. Dierich A. Le M.M. Dolle P. Tzavara E. Hanoune J. Roques B.P. Kieffer B.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 819-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). It is increasingly evident that alternative splicing of the Oprm1 transcript can generate multiple receptor isoforms (3Pasternak G.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 67-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of such splice-mediated variation, however, remains incompletely understood. Mu opioid receptors are regulated by agonist-induced endocytosis both in native neurons and in heterologous cell models (4Keith D.E. Anton B. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V.

Following their initial endocytosis, receptors can traverse divergent post-endocytic pathways that confer distinct effects on cellular signaling. Recycling of internalized receptors to the plasma membrane typically promotes rapid recovery of cellular responsiveness to subsequent agonist exposure (8Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J. Krueger K. Daaka Y. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 9Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G.

Trafficking of internalized receptors to lysosomes promotes receptor proteolysis, contributing to down-regulation of cellular receptor number and prolonged attenuation of cellular responsiveness (11Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 289: 607-624PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of cultured cell models have established that the specificity with which receptors traffic via these distinct pathways is determined in large part by molecular sorting operations occurring shortly after endocytosis (12Tsao P. von Zastrow M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 365-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that such post-endocytic sorting decisions contribute to determining the long term effects of opioids in vivo (13Koch T. Hollt V. Pharmacol.

This so-called MOR1-derived recycling sequence (MRS) is sufficient to promote efficient recycling when fused to a distinct GPCR, defining this sequence as a bona fide endocytic sorting determinant (16Tanowitz M. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45978-45986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). MOR1 is encoded by exons 1–4 of the murine Oprm1 gene, and essential residues of the MRS are encoded entirely by exon 4. Although the exon 4-encoded MRS is conserved in all known MOR1 homologs, early studies of Oprm1 expression in human (17Bare L.A. Mansson E. Yang D. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 213-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), rat (18Zimprich A. Simon T. Hollt V. Febs.

Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 396-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) discovered the existence of Oprm1 transcripts that include exons 1–3 but lack exon 4 due to alternative RNA processing. At present a large number of Oprm1 splice variants lacking exon 4 (and hence the MRS) have been identified, and there is convincing evidence that at least some of these variants are naturally expressed in the central nervous system (3Pasternak G.W.

Mu opioid receptor 1 [d-Ala2,Me-Phe4,Glyol5]enkephalin MOR1-derived recycling sequence G-protein-coupled receptor human embryonic kidney Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline isobutylmethylxanthine None of the known exon 4-lacking opioid receptor variants represents a simple deletion of the MRS, however, and all such variants identified to date contain other C-terminal sequences distinct from the MRS. This observation suggests two opposing hypotheses regarding the possible significance of alternative RNA processing to the post-endocytic sorting of receptors. One possibility is that exon 4-lacking splice variants contain alternate cytoplasmic sequence(s) that possess recycling activity similar to the MRS, effectively complementing the lack of this sequence in receptor variants. A second possibility is that alternative cytoplasmic sequences present in exon 4-lacking variants do not complement the MRS, resulting in significant differences among opioid receptor variants in post-endocytic sorting. Distinguishing these hypotheses is important, because each has fundamentally different functional and mechanistic implications. If the first hypothesis is correct, this could identify divergent recycling sequences encoded by the same opioid receptor gene. Although biochemically distinct recycling sequences have been recognized previously by comparing GPCRs encoded by separate structural genes (15Hanyaloglu A.C. von Zastrow M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2008; 48: 537-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), we are not aware of any precedent for the existence of distinct recycling sequences encoded by alternate exons of the same receptor gene. If the second hypothesis is correct, this could establish a function of alternative RNA processing in dictating the post-endocytic sorting itinerary of receptors. Although alternative RNA processing has been shown previously to alter various aspects of GPCR function and regulation, including the ability of various ligands to promote initial endocytosis and desensitization of opioid receptor variants (10Koch T. Schulz S. Pfeiffer M. Klutzny M. Schroder H. Kahl E. Hollt V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31408-31414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 20Pasternak G.W. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 312-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we are not aware of any previous evidence for RNA processing determining the post-endocytic sorting of receptors between functionally divergent pathways. The present study investigated these hypotheses using several previously identified murine Oprm1 splice variants expressed in HEK293 cells, a well established experimental model in which sequence-dependent recycling of MOR1 was first established (16Tanowitz M. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45978-45986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Our findings clarify functional differences among Oprm1 splice variants and reveal a novel role of alternative RNA processing in specifying the post-endocytic sorting fate of GPCRs. cDNA Constructs—A FLAG-tagged version of the cloned murine MOR1 (or MOP-1 receptor) variant cDNA was described previously (16Tanowitz M. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45978-45986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Additional splice variants were generated by modification of this construct using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and PCR (Vent polymerase, New England Biolabs). All cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and sequence-verified (Elim Biopharmaceuticals Inc., Hayward, CA) before study. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10! fetal bovine serum (University of California San Francisco Cell Culture Facility). Cells grown in 6-cm culture dishes were transfected using a calcium phosphate co-precipitation method as described previously (16Tanowitz M. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45978-45986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For studies of receptor trafficking in transiently transfected cells, cells were plated onto glass coverslips 24 h after transfection, and experiments were conducted 24–48 h thereafter. Clonal populations of stably transfected cells expressing epitope-tagged receptors were studied 24–48 h after plating. Fluorescence Microscopy—Endocytic trafficking of receptors initially labeled in the plasma membrane was visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a previously described “antibody feeding” method (21Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells plated on glass coverslips (Corning) were specifically labeled for surface receptors by incubation for 30 min in the presence of M1 anti-FLAG antibody (2.0 μg/ml, Sigma). Surface-labeled cells were subsequently incubated (at 37 °C for 30 min) in the presence of 10 μm [d-Ala2,Me-Phe4,Glyol5]enkephalin (DAMGO) to drive agonist-induced internalization. Following this incubation, cells were either fixed immediately, or were washed twice in DMEM and subsequently incubated (at 37 °C for 45 min) in the presence of an excess concentration of the opioid antagonist (10 μm naloxone). Cells were fixed in 4! paraformaldehyde freshly prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 15 min then quenched with three washes of Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2. Specimens were permeabilized with 0.1! Triton X-100 (Sigma) in a blocking solution (3! dry milk in Tris-buffered saline plus 1 mm CaCl2) and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:500 dilution, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 30 min to detect antibody-labeled receptors. Fluorescence microscopy was carried out in the wide field using a Nikon 60×, numerical aperture 1.4, objective and standard interference filter sets (Omega Optical). Images were collected using a 12-bit cooled charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments) interfaced to a computer running Metamorph software (Molecular Dynamics). Fluorescence Ratio Imaging—To quantify recycling of variant receptors in individual cells, a dual-label version of the antibody feeding method was applied. This variation specifically labels the internalized and recycled pools of receptors with distinct fluorochromes, based on the pronounced calcium dependence of anti-FLAG antibody binding, and has been described in detail previously (16Tanowitz M. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45978-45986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Fractional recycling of antibody-labeled receptors was calculated in individual cells exactly as described in this previous work. In each experiment, 20–30 cells were imaged at random per construct. Recycling values reported represent mean percentages calculated across four to five independent experiments. Fluorescence Flow Cytometry—Internalization and recycling of epitope-tagged receptors were estimated using fluorescence flow cytometry of stably transfected cells to measure changes in the relative amount of FLAG-tagged receptors present in the plasma membrane after surface labeling with Alexa488-conjugated M1 antibody, as described previously (22Gage R.M. Kim K.A. Cao T.T. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44712-44720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Triplicate samples (2 × 104 cells/sample) were analyzed for each condition and in each experiment. The mean fluorescence values for each experiment (n = 5 experiments) were averaged, and the ±S.E. was calculated across all experiments. Internalization of receptors was determined by fractional reduction in surface receptor fluorescence, and recycling was determined by fractional surface receptor recovery, calculated as described previously (16Tanowitz M. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45978-45986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Surface Biotinylation and Assays of Receptor Proteolysis—Immunoblotting and cell surface biotinylation assays were carried out as described previously (23Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 24Tanowitz M. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50219-50222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Radioligand Binding Assay—Cell monolayers were lifted with PBS supplemented with 2 mm EDTA, washed twice with PBS by centrifugation (200 × g for 5 min), and subjected to a freeze/thaw cycle in PBS containing a protease inhibitor mixture (leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) followed by four passes using a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer. Large particulates and nuclear material were removed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, and a crude membrane and cytosol fraction was isolated. Binding assays were conducted in 120 μl of 25 mm Tris-Cl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Assay tubes contained 50–100 μg of the crude membrane preparation, determined using the Bradford reagent (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) purchased from Bio-Rad and bovine serum albumin as standard. Suspensions were incubated with 20 nm [3H]diprenorphine (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at room temperature prior to vacuum filtration through glass fiber filters (Packard Instruments) and repeated washes with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Bound radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting (Scintiverse, Fisher) using a Beckman LS 6500 instrument. Bound counts represented ≤10! of input radioligand. Nonspecific binding, defined by assays conducted in the presence of 10 μm naloxone, was ≤10! of total counts recovered from washed filters. All assays were conducted in triplicate. Assay for cAMP Accumulation—Cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated 48-well cultures dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10! fetal bovine serum. For acute determination of opioid receptor-mediated signaling, the medium was replaced with 0.5 ml of serum-free media containing 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and 10 μm forskolin with or without the indicated concentration of DAMGO. The cells were then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was terminated by addition of 0.5 ml of 0.1 n HCl/0.1! Triton X-100. Opioid preincubations, as described in the text, were carried out prior to medium change into IBMX and forskolin. DAMGO present in the preincubation medium was removed prior to assay by three rapid medium changes with equilibrated DMEM/fetal bovine serum. Control experiments showing no effect of the opioid antagonist naloxone on forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in these cells verified the effectiveness of the wash procedure. cAMP was determined in clarified extracts using a competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay obtained commercially (Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, MI). Oprm1 Splice Variants Lacking Exon 4 Recycle Inefficiently after Ligand-induced Endocytosis—cDNAs encoding FLAG-tagged versions of four previously identified murine Oprm1 splice variants possessing divergent fourth exons, MOR1, MOR1B, MOR1D, and MOR1E, were examined (Fig. 1). The steady-state subcellular localization of receptors expressed in HEK293 cells was visualized using anti-FLAG immunostaining and fluorescence microscopy. For all variants tested, the N-terminal epitope tag was clearly detected by surface labeling of non-permeabilized cells, confirming successful targeting of receptor variants to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2, A, D, G, and J). Exposure of cells to the opioid peptide agonist DAMGO (10 μm) for 30 min produced a pronounced redistribution of MOR1, MOR1B, and MOR1D to intracellular vesicles, consistent with rapid agonist-induced endocytosis of receptors. Redistribution of MOR1E, although clearly visible by microscopy, was less pronounced than that observed for the other variants (Fig. 2, B, E, H, and K). The internalized pool of MOR1 returned to a largely plasma membrane distribution within 45 min after removing DAMGO from the culture medium (Fig. 2C), consistent with rapid and efficient recycling of this receptor as shown previously (16Tanowitz M. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45978-45986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In marked contrast, a substantial fraction of labeled MOR1B, MOR1D, and MOR1E remained in intracellular vesicles, suggesting impaired recycling of these receptor variants (Fig. 2, C, F, I, and L).FIGURE 2Localization of receptor variants by fluorescence microscopy. Representative epifluorescence micrographs showing the localization of Oprm1 splice variants visualized in fields of HEK293 cells after labeling receptors present in the plasma membrane selectively with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. Surface-labeled cells expressing the indicated receptor variant were incubated for 30 min in the absence of opioid (A, D, G, and J), exposed to DAMGO for 30 min (B, E, H, and K) or exposed to DAMGO for 30 min, stripped of antibody bound to residual surface receptors with PBS/EDTA and incubated in fresh media containing naloxone for 45 min (C, F, I, and L).

Importantly, this range of receptor expression has been shown previously not to saturate the post-endocytic sorting machinery (23Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol.

We then used fluorescence flow cytometry to estimate receptor endocytosis and recycling by measuring ligand-induced changes in surface receptor immunoreactivity in large cell populations (16Tanowitz M. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45978-45986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). DAMGO produced a rapid and pronounced reduction in relative surface receptor number in cell clones expressing MOR1, MOR1B, and MOR1D, confirming robust agonist-induced endocytosis of these variants, whereas internalization of MOR1E was detectable but significantly reduced (Fig. 3A). Surface MOR1 immunoreactivity recovered almost completely within 60 min after removal of DAMGO from the culture medium (Fig. 3B, left bar), as expected from the efficient recycling of this receptor variant shown previously. In contrast, parallel analysis of cell clones expressing MOR1B and MOR1D revealed significantly reduced surface receptor recovery (Fig. 3B, second and third bars). Time course analysis revealed that, although all variants tested exhibited some degree of rapid recycling, the extent to which MOR1B and MOR1D recycled was markedly reduced when compared with MOR1 (Fig. 3C). It was not possible to determine the recycling efficiency of MOR1E accurately using the flow cytometric assay, because it internalized poorly compared with the other variants. Another limitation of the flow cytometric assay, which is potentially applicable to all variants, is that this assay does not distinguish endocytic recycling from surface receptor delivery occurring via non-endocytic route(s) such as the biosynthetic pathway (26Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar).TABLE 1Pharmacological characterization of stably transfected cell clones used in this study Saturation binding analysis was carried out on a total membrane fraction using [3H]diprenorphine, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bmax and Kd values were estimated by fitting data to a one-site binding model using GraphPad Prism software.MOR1MOR1BMOR1DMOR1EBmax (fmol/μg)0.7552.740.5062.49Kd (nm)0.430.610.450.48 Open table in a new tab As an independent means to quantify receptor recycling, which is more sensitive than the flow cytometric assay and measures only surface delivery from the endocytic pathway, a previously established fluorescence ratio assay based on specific labeling of previously internalized receptors was applied (16Tanowitz M. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45978-45986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Reduced recycling of MOR1B, MOR1D, and MOR1E relative to MOR1 was visually evident from the increased immunoreactive signal (Alexa488 fluorescence) representing internalized receptors that failed to recycle 60 min after agonist washout (example micrographs are shown in Fig. 4A). Quantification of this assay across multiple cells and independent experiments confirmed the significantly reduced recycling of MOR1B and MOR1D relative to MOR1 (Fig. 4B). This method also established reduced recycling of MOR1E, despite its relatively low level of agonist-induced internalization that precluded accurate quantification by the flow cytometric assay. Together, the present results clearly refute the hypothesis that alternatively spliced carboxyl termini of the tested splice variants contain a recycling sequence comparable to the MRS. Instead, they strongly support the hypothesis that alternative splicing dictates the post-endocytic sorting fate of receptors by including or removing the MRS. Enhanced Proteolytic Down-regulation of Recycling-defective Oprm1 Splice Variants—To begin to investigate the potential functional significance of post-endocytic sorting differences, we examined the ability of continuous incubation of cells with DAMGO to promote proteolytic degradation of opioid receptor variants. Because mutational deletion of the MRS from MOR1 effectively re-routes endocytosed receptors from the recycling pathway to lysosomes (16Tanowitz M. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45978-45986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), we reasoned that naturally occurring variants lacking the MRS might exhibit enhanced proteolytic down-regulation compared with MOR1. Immunoblotting revealed that all receptor variants exhibited heterogeneous electrophoretic mobility by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5A), as observed previously in studies of MOR1 (16Tanowitz M. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45978-45986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 27Whistler J.L. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9914-9919Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To compare variants, we focused on immunoreactive species corresponding in electrophoretic mobility to the complex glycosylated form of each receptor variant that represents the major species detected in the plasma membrane by surface biotinylation (arrow in Fig. 5A). Following incubation of cells in the continuous presence of 10 μm DAMGO, significant differences in the stability of individual splice variants were apparent (Fig. 5B). MOR1 was relatively stable, with substantial immunoreactivity detected on blots even after 8 h of continuous agonist exposure (Fig. 5B, top panel). The recycling-defective variants (lower panels) had visibly decreased stability in the presence of DAMGO relative to MOR1. MOR1B and MOR1D were considerably less stable, with a pronounced decrease in full-length receptor immunoreactivity visible within ∼2 h of DAMGO exposure (panels 2 and 3 from top). MOR1E was also less stable that MOR1, as indicated by loss of immunoreactivity corresponding to full-length receptor protein and a relative shift of receptor immunoreactivity toward lower apparent molecular mass (panel 4 from top). To quantify differences among receptor variants in agonist-induced degradation, we applied a previously established radioligand binding assay to measure total cellular receptor number using the high affinity antagonist [3H]diprenorphine (28Law P.-Y Hom D.S. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1982; 72: 1-4Google Scholar). All of the receptor variants exhibited significant down-regulation following incubation of cells in the presence of 10 μm DAMGO for 8 h, as indicated by reduced Bmax relative to that estimated in membranes prepared from cells not previously exposed to DAMGO. The magnitude of agonist-induced down-regulation observed at this time point was significantly greater for each of the recycling-defective receptor variants, however, when compared with MOR1 (Fig. 5C). Time course analysis (Fig. 5D) revealed that MOR1 down-regulated with an estimated t½ of ∼9 h. In contrast MOR1B, MOR1D, and MOR1E down-regulated with estimated t½ values of 4.7, 4.9, and 5.7 h, respectively. These quantitative pharmacological data are fully consistent with the biochemical observations and, together, argue strongly that inhibited recycling of variant receptors after acute endocytosis is indeed associated with their enhanced proteolytic degradation in the prolonged prese"

Dapper (Dpr), as a Dishevelled interactor, has been suggested to modulate Wnt signaling by promoting Dishevelled degradation. Here, we provide evidence that Dpr1 shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Although overexpressed Dpr1 was mainly found in the cytoplasm, endogenous Dpr1 was localized over the cell, and Wnt1 induced its nuclear export. Treatment with leptomycin B induced nuclear accumulation of both endogenous and overexpressed Dpr1. We further identified the nuclear localization signal and the nuclear export signal within Dpr1. Using reporter assay and in vivo zebrafish embryo assay, we demonstrated that the forced nuclearly localized Dpr1 possessed the ability to antagonize Wnt signaling. Dpr1 interacted with β-catenin and LEF1 and disrupted their complex formation. Furthermore, Dpr1 could associate with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and enhance the LEF1-HDAC1 interaction. Together, our findings suggest that Dpr1 negatively modulates the basal activity of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the nucleus by keeping LEF1 in the repressive state. Thus, Dpr1 controls Wnt/β-catenin signaling in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus.

The secreted growth factors of the Wnt family play key roles in early embryogenesis and tissue homeostasis in adults by modulating cell proliferation, differentiation, morphology, and migration. Appropriate control of their signaling activity is essential for normal physiological activity as dysregulation of their signaling is associated with various types of human diseases such as cancer (1Moon R.T.

The binding of Wnt to its cell surface receptors, Frizzled (Fz) and low density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6) leads to the recruitment of Dishevelled (Dvl) to Fz and Axin to LRP5/6, resulting in the disruption of the destruction complex and consequently the accumulation of β-catenin. The accumulated β-catenin moves into the nucleus and activates the transcription of target genes through interacting with T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer binding factor (LEF) transcription factors (10Behrens J. von Kries J.P.

FASEB J. 2007; 21: 682-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, recent studies suggested that the Dpr family members may also positively regulate Wnt signaling through distinct mechanisms. Zebrafish Dpr1 and Dpr2 were reported to positively modulate the canonical β-catenin or noncanonical calcium-planar cell polarity pathways of Wnt signaling during fish embryo development, respectively (18Waxman J.S. Hocking A.M. Stoick C.L. Moon R.T. Development. 2004; 131: 5909-5921Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Frodo, a Dpr homolog that shares 90! identity at the amino acid level to Xenopus Dpr, has been suggested to positively synergize with Dvl to induce secondary axis and be required for normal eye and neural tissue development (15Gloy J. Hikasa H. Sokol S.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition, we have demonstrated that zebrafish and mouse Dpr2 specifically inhibited transforming growth factor β/Nodal signaling during mesoderm induction by promoting lysosomal degradation of its type I receptors (19Zhang L. Zhou H. Su Y. Sun Z. Zhang H. Zhang Y. Ning Y. Chen Y.G. Meng A. Science. 2004; 306: 114-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 21Su Y. Zhang L. Gao X. Meng F. Wen J. Zhou H. Meng A. Chen Y.G. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 682-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Dpr has been also implicated to be associated with tumorigenesis. Human Dpr1 was down-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma, and this down-regulation was correlated with the cytoplasm accumulation of β-catenin (22Yau T.O. Chan C.Y. Chan K.L. Lee M.F. Wong C.M. Fan S.T. Ng I.O. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 1607-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).Our recent work demonstrated that human Dpr1 promotes Dvl2 degradation by a lysosome inhibitor-sensitive mechanism in the cytoplasm (20Zhang L.

Sokol S.Y. Development. 2004; 131: 4725-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), cell cycle and DNA replication-related protein Dbf4 (24Brott B.K. Sokol S.Y. Dev.

Endogenous Dpr1 was showed to be found throughout the cytoplasm as punctate spots and diffusely in the nucleus in both cultured cells and Xenopus animal cap (14Cheyette B.N. Waxman J.S. Miller J.R.

Although ectopic Dpr1 and Dpr2 were predominantly present in the cytoplasm, they were also visible in the nucleus of some cells (14Cheyette B.N. Waxman J.S. Miller J.R. Takemaru K. Sheldahl L.C.

Development. 2004; 131: 5909-5921Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The observation that some of the C-terminal fragments of Dpr1 are localized almost exclusively in the nucleus further suggested that Dpr1 might have a role in the nucleus (20Zhang L. Gao X. Wen J. Ning Y. Chen Y.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 8607-8612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance of Dpr1 in the nucleus is still unclear.In this study we provide evidence that human Dpr1 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. We have further identified a classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) and a nuclear export signal (NES) within Dpr1. In addition, we found that mutation of the NES rendered the exclusive nuclear localization of Dpr1, and this Dpr1 mutant still retained its ability of inhibiting Wnt signaling. Finally we showed that Dpr1 could disrupt the LEF1-β-catenin complex and recruit co-repressor HDAC1 to LEF1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Plasmids—Human Dpr1 cDNA and siRNA against Dpr1 were described previously (20Zhang L.

CO2-containing atmosphere at 37 °C. To generate stable cells expressing Dpr1-specific siRNA construct, HeLa cells were transfected with siRNA constructs in pSUPER with specific anti-Dpr1 sequence or anti-nonspecific sequence (20Zhang L.

Individual clones were then obtained after confirmation of Dpr1 expression by immunoblotting and reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction.Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Immunoblotting—HEK293T or HeLa cells were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate method or Lipofectamine. At 36 h post-transfection the cells were lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 1! Triton X-100) plus protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 4 °C. After 12,000 × g centrifugation for 15 min, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with specific antibody and protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 3 h at 4 °C. Thereafter, the precipitants were washed 3 times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1! Nonidet P-40, 0.5! sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1! SDS), and the immune complexes were eluted with sample buffer containing 1! SDS for 5 min at 95 °C and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed with primary antibodies and then secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence. Goat anti-LEF1, mouse anti-β-catenin, and mouse anti-HDAC1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-Dpr1 antibody was described previously (20Zhang L. Gao X. Wen J. Ning Y.

Then Nonidet P-40 was added to 0.001! (for HEK293T) or 0.005! (for HeLa), and cells were vortexed for 30 s and centrifuged at 1000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The low speed centrifugation was washed with the ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times and then resuspended in an equivalent volume of hypotonic lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1! Nonidet P-40, 0.5! sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1! SDS) and lysed by sonification. After centrifugation at 15,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatant (nuclear extracts) was collected for analysis.Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4! paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1! Triton X-100 for 10 min, and blocked with 3! bovine serum albumin in PBS for 60 min. The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1! Tween 20) for 3 h, washed twice with PBS, and then incubated with rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for an additional 40 min. The nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Images were obtained with confocal Olympus fluoview 500 microscope.Luciferase Reporter Assays—HEK293T cells were transfected with various plasmids as indicated in the figures. 36 h after transfection, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activities were measured by aluminometer (Berthold Technologies). Reporter activity was normalized to the co-transfected Renilla. Experiments were repeated in triplicate, and the data represent the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments.In Vitro Synthesis of mRNA and Microinjection of Zebrafish Embryos—Capped mRNAs were in vitro synthesized with the Cap-Scribe kit (Roche Applied Science). The synthesized mRNA was purified using the RNAeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and dissolved in nuclease-free water. 20 pmol of synthetic mRNA was injected into 1-cell embryos using a gas-driven microinjector (Sutter Instruments). Injection dose was an estimated amount received by a single embryo. For the mRNA injection experiment, the control embryos were injected with green fluorescence protein (GFP) mRNA.Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—The ChIP assay was carried out essentially as described previously (28Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation. Precipitated genomic DNA pellets were subjected to PCR. The primers used to amplify the human c-Myc promoter harboring the third LEF/TCF binding elements, as described in Sierra et al. (29Sierra J.

Total RNA was prepared using Trizol reagent (Roche Applied Science) and treated with DNase (Takara). Two microgram of RNA was reverse-transcribed at 42 °C for 45 min in a 20-μl reaction mixture using the reverse transcription system (Promega). PCR was performed with the following primer sets: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′-CATCACTGCCACCCAGAAGA-3′ and 5′-GCTGTAGCCAAATTCGTTGT-3′); c-Myc (5′-CCTACCCTCTAACGACAGC-3′ and 5′-CTCTGACCTTTTGCCAGGAG-3′); cyclin D1 (5′-ATCGAAGCCCTGCTGGAGT-3′ and 5′-GGGAAAGAGCAAAGGAAAA-3′).Flow Cytometric Analysis—HeLa cells co-transfected with GFP and other constructs as indicated were treated with Wnt3a-containing or control L cell-cultured-conditioned medium. Then cells were harvested and fixed with 75! alcohol in -20 °C overnight. Before flow cytometry analysis, cells were treated with 100 μg/ml RNase and 5 μg/ml propidium iodide in 4 °C for 30 min. The GFP-positive cells were selected by FAC-Scan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). The Dprl-siRNA-stable cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis as above.RESULTSDpr1 Shuttles between the Cytoplasm and the Nucleus—Previous studies have shown that endogenous Xenopus and human Dpr proteins are distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas ectopic Dpr1 stays mainly in the cytoplasm as punctate dots (14Cheyette B.N. Waxman J.S. Miller J.R. Takemaru K. Sheldahl L.C. Khlebtsova N. Fox E.P. Earnest T. Moon R.T. Dev.

To further investigate the cellular distribution of Dpr1, Myc-tagged full-length human Dpr1 was expressed in HeLa cells and analyzed via immunofluorescent confocal studies. Consistent with previous reports, full-length Dpr1 displayed a punctate pattern in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). We then examined the distribution of endogenous Dpr1 in HeLa cells using a specific polyclonal antibody against Dpr1 and found that endogenous Dpr1 was distributed in the punctate pattern throughout the cytoplasm and also apparently stained in the nucleus (Fig. 1B). This observation coincides with the localization pattern of endogenous Xenopus Dpr (14Cheyette B.N. Waxman J.S. Miller J.R. Takemaru K. Sheldahl L.C. Khlebtsova N. Fox E.P. Earnest T. Moon R.T. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 449-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Interestingly, upon expression of Wnt-1 in the cells, Dpr1 tended to shift mostly into the cytoplasm instead (Fig. 1C). These data raise the possibility that Dpr1 may be capable of shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus.To validate the above possibility, we asked whether leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of the nuclear export mediated by export receptor chromosome maintenance region 1 (31Kudo N. Matsumori N. Taoka H. Fujiwara D. Schreiner E.P. Wolff B. Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9112-9117Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar), has any effect on the localization of Dpr1. When HeLa cells transfected with full-length Dpr1 were treated with LMB for 30 min, almost all the Dpr1 was accumulated in the nucleus (Fig. 1D). In addition, endogenous Dpr1 accumulated around and in the nucleus upon LMB treatment regardless of Wnt-1 stimulation (Fig. 1, E and F).The Functional NES and NLS Mediate the Nucleocytoplasmic Shuttling of Dpr1—The translocation of proteins larger than 40–60 kDa in and out of the nucleus is usually dependent on the active transport mediated by nuclear transport receptors, which recognize certain specific NLSs and NESs (32Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). Dpr1 is about 92 kDa and seems too large to diffuse freely through nuclear pores. We, thus, reasoned that Dpr1 may have functional NES and NLS signals to mediate its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling.To map the region of Dpr1 responsible for its shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, we generated several truncation mutants of Dpr1 (Fig. 2A) and then examined their subcellular localization in HeLa cells. All deletion mutants were correctly expressed, as indicated by immunoblotting analysis (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2B, the N-terminal deletions Dpr1(N1) and Dpr1(N2) were predominantly localized in the cytoplasm, and LMB treatment induced a partial nuclear location of Dpr1(N1) and the complete nuclear accumulation of Dpr1(N2), indicating that the putative NES element was localized in the N-terminal region of amino acids 1–311. The C-terminal deletions Dpr1(C2) and Dpr1(C3) exclusively localized in the nucleus (Fig. 2B), whereas Dpr1 Dpr1(C1), which only missed the N-terminal 96 amino acids, showed similar punctate distribution in the cytoplasm similar to that of wild-type Dpr1. LMB treatment resulted in the nuclear accumulation of Dpr1(C1). As to the central region truncations, Dpr1(M1) displayed a dispersed distribution throughout the cells with most in the nucleus, whereas Dpr1(M2), which has only 10 more amino acids than Dpr1(M1), displayed a strict nuclear localization as Dpr1(M3), implying that those 10 amino acids (620–630 amino acids) are important for the nuclear distribution of Dpr1. LMB treatment had virtually no influence on the distribution manner of Dpr1(M1), suggesting that there are no localization signals in this region. These results together indicate that the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of Dpr1 account for the nuclear export and import of Dpr1, respectively.FIGURE 2The subcellular localization of Dpr1 is determined by its nuclear export signal and its nuclear localization signal. A, schematic representation of Dpr1 truncation mutants. The number indicates the amino acid residues. B, distribution of Dpr1 truncation mutants. HeLa cells were transfected with Myc-Dpr1 mutants (0.5 μg each) as indicated. 36 h later the cells were treated with or without 100 pm LMB for 30 min and then processed for immunofluorescence with anti-Myc antibody and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody. C and D, mutations of the potential NES resulted in the nuclear accumulation of Dpr1. Amino acid alignment of Dpr1 showed that the potential NES was highly conserved from Xenopus to human (C). Myc-Dpr1 NES mutants NESm or NESm2 (0.5 μg each) were transfected into HeLa cells, and the subcellular localization was determined by indirect immunofluorescence (D). E and F, mutations in the potential NLS retain Dpr1 in the cytoplasm regardless of LMB treatment. The potential NLS was highly conserved in Dpr1 proteins from different species (E). Myc-Dpr1 NLS mutants NLSm or NLSm2 were transfected into HeLa cells (0.5 μg each). After treated with or without 100 pm LMB for 30 min, their subcellular localization was detected by indirect immunofluorescence (F). The nuclei were counterstained with diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, blue). Scale bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)By inspecting the amino acid sequence of human Dpr1, we found one potential leucine-rich NES at positions amino acids 132–141 (Fig. 2C) and one potential bipartite NLS at amino acids 610–623 (Fig. 2E), and both the potential NES and NLS sequences were highly conserved from zebrafish to human. To examine the importance of these potential NES and NLS, point mutations within the putative motifs were generated with two important residues replaced by Ala (Fig. 2, C and E), yielding two NES mutants, Dpr1(NESm) and Dpr1(NESm2), and two NLS mutants, Dpr1(NESm) and Dpr1(NESm2). Strikingly, we found that replacement of the anterior two residues (L132A, I136A) in the NES (Dpr1(NESm)) led to complete nuclear accumulation of the mutant Dpr1 protein as indicated by immunostaining in HeLa cells (Fig. 2D), indicating that these two residues are essential for the nuclear export of Dpr1. In contrast, the localization of Dpr1(NESm2) was relatively unaffected when Leu-139 and Leu-141 were substituted with Ala.We did similar manipulation on the potential NLS by point mutations, yielding two mutants, Dpr1(NLSm), with the Ala substitution at Lys-622 and Lys-623, and Dpr1(NLSm2), with the Ala substitution at Lys-610 and Lys-611 (Fig. 2E). Both mutants exhibited similar cytoplasmic punctate distribution as wild-type protein in HeLa cells (Fig. 2F). However, LMB treatment did not alter the cytoplasmic distribution of Dpr1(NLSm), although it caused partial nuclear accumulation of Dpr1(NLSm2) (Fig. 2F). These data suggest that the bipartite NLS is important for the nuclear transport of Dpr1 and imply that the residues Lys-622 and Lys-623 play a key role in the nuclear localization of Dpr1. Localization of these mutants was also examined in HEK293T cells, and similar results were obtained. Furthermore, Wnt-1 stimulation showed no detectable influence on that of these mutants (data not shown). Together these results validate that Dpr1 protein shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, and this shuttling is mediated by the functional NES and NLS sequences.Dpr1 Antagonizes Wnt Signaling in the Nucleus—To explore the functional significance of Dpr1 localization in the nucleus, the effect of Dpr1(NESm) and Dpr1(NLSm) on Wnt signaling was examined. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with the Wnt-responsive reporter LEF-luciferase or Topflash-luciferase, Wnt1 together with wild-type or mutant Dpr1. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, wild-type Dpr1 and its two mutants interfered with the Wnt1-induced expression of the reporters LEF-luciferase and Topflash-luciferase in a dose-dependent manner, although the nuclear-localized Dpr1(NESm) is less effective, whereas none of them had effect on the control reporter Fopflash-luciferase (data not shown). Similar results were obtained in HeLa cells (data not shown).FIGURE 3Dpr1 down-regulates Wnt signaling in the nucleus. A–D, the nuclear Dpr1(NESm) retains its ability to inhibit Wnt1 or β-cateni"

Recent crystallographic studies have shown how Gαq interacts with two activation-dependent targets, p63RhoGEF and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2). These proteins bind to the effector-binding site of Gαq in a manner that does not appear to physically overlap with the site on Gαq bound by regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins, which function as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Herein we confirm the formation of RGS-Gαq-GRK2/p63RhoGEF ternary complexes using flow cytometry protein interaction and GAP assays. RGS2 and, to a lesser extent, RGS4 are negative allosteric modulators of Gαq binding to either p63RhoGEF or GRK2. Conversely, GRK2 enhances the GAP activity of RGS4 but has little effect on that of RGS2. Similar but smaller magnitude responses are induced by p63RhoGEF. The fact that GRK2 and p63RhoGEF respond similarly to these RGS proteins supports the hypothesis that GRK2 is a bona fide Gαq effector. The results also suggest that signal transduction pathways initiated by GRK2, such as the phosphorylation of G protein-coupled receptors, and by p63RhoGEF, such as the activation of gene transcription, can be regulated by RGS proteins via both allosteric and GAP mechanisms.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activated GPCRs catalyze nucleotide exchange on Gα subunits, thereby converting the inactive (GDP-bound) Gαβγ heterotrimer into activated Gα·GTP and Gβγ subunits. These subunits then interact with downstream effectors to elicit intracellular responses (2.Neves S.R. Ram P.T. Iyengar R. Science. 2002; 296: 1636-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). Duration of signaling is limited by the rate of GTP hydrolysis on the Gα subunit. After returning to the GDP-bound state, Gα reforms the inactive Gαβγ heterotrimer, which can then undergo additional rounds of receptor-mediated activation. For some families of Gα subunits, the rate of GTP hydrolysis can be accelerated by direct interactions with effectors (3.Berstein G. Blank J.L. Jhon D.Y. Exton J.H. Rhee S.G. Ross E.M.

Although RGS proteins are generally thought of as inhibitors of heterotrimeric G protein signaling mediated by the Gαi and Gαq/11 families, they may also serve to spatially focus the signals being propagated (7.Zhong H.

Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) complexes revealed that RGS proteins and effectors interact with discrete footprints on the surface of Gα and have the potential to bind simultaneously (11.Sunahara R.K.

Protein Chem. 2007; 74: 1-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Direct experimental support for an RGS-Gα-effector ternary complex came from analysis of the interactions of transducin (Gαt) with RGS proteins and the γ subunit of cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDEγ). Both PDEγ (13.Arshavsky V. Bownds M.D. Nature. 1992; 357: 416-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and RGS9 (14.He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) are required for physiological rates of GTP hydrolysis on Gαt. Although PDEγ has no GAP activity on its own, it can stimulate RGS9-mediated GAP activity by up to ∼3-fold (14.He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies (15.McEntaffer R.L. Natochin M. Artemyev N.O.

Kercher M.A. He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Sigler P.B. Nature. 2001; 409: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) were all consistent with a model of allosteric modulation between the effector and RGS binding sites of Gαt, with little or no direct functional interaction between PDEγ and RGS9. It has been proposed that this PDEγ-regulated GAP activity prevents a “short circuit” of the phototransduction cascade via premature hydrolysis of Gαt·GTP before effectors can functionally interact with the G protein (18.Nekrasova E. Berman D. Rustandi R. Hamm H. Gilman A. Arshavsky V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7638-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Conversely, PDEγ inhibits the GAP activity of other RGS proteins (RGS4, GAIP, and RGS16/RGSr) most likely through a negative allosteric mechanism (18.Nekrasova E. Berman D. Rustandi R. Hamm H. Gilman A. Arshavsky V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7638-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 19.Natochin M. Granovsky A.E. Artemyev N.O. J. Biol.

It is not known whether analogous ternary complexes are formed by other members of the Gαi family or by subunits from the Gαq family or if there are other effector/RGS combinations that are synergistic with respect to GAP activity on Gα. The Gq/11 family of G proteins is involved in an array of cellular processes that include platelet activation, cardiovascular development, and regulation of memory, appetite, motor coordination, and sleep (21.Offermanns S. Simon M.I. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1375-1381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Hubbard K.B. Hepler J.R. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 135-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). They are also strongly implicated in pathophysiological processes such as the development of cardiac hypertrophy (23.Dorn Jr., G.W. Force T. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 527-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and high blood pressure (24.Harris D.M. Cohn H.I. Pesant S. Zhou R.H. Eckhart A.D. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 293: 3072-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although the canonical effector of Gαq is phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) (25.Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar), recent structural, biochemical, and whole animal studies have confirmed that the Trio family of RhoA guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs), namely Trio, Duet, and p63RhoGEF, are also direct targets of Gαq (26.Lutz S.

Another putative effector target of Gαq is G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) (30.Theilade J. Haunso S. Sheikh S.P. Curr. Drug Targets Immune Endocr. Metabol. Dis. 2001; 1: 139-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GRK2 phosphorylates activated heptahelical receptors, which are then bound by arrestin and targeted for endocytosis (31.Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Furthermore, through a process known as phosphorylation-independent desensitization (32.Willets J.M. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A. J. Biol.

Science. 2005; 310: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that GRK2 is in fact an effector that can initiate its own signaling cascades in response to the activation of Gαq. Although one obvious pathway is simply the phosphorylation of activated GPCRs, GRK2 has also recently been reported to phosphorylate insulin receptor substrate-1 (37.Usui I. Imamura T. Babendure J.L.

Both proteins have been reported to serve as effector antagonists because they can inhibit PLCβ signaling by either GTPase-deficient Gα subunits or Gα subunits loaded with non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs (43.Heximer S.P.

In this study we have used biophysical and kinetic studies to demonstrate the formation of ternary complexes of Gαq, RGS proteins, and effectors. We also show that RGS2 and RGS4 are negative allosteric modulators of proteins that bind to the effector-binding site of Gαq, providing the molecular basis for their reported roles as effector antagonists. Conversely, GRK2 and p63RhoGEF are shown to be allosteric modulators of RGS GAP activity. GRK2 is able to stimulate RGS4 GAP activity on Gαq to a similar extent as PDEγ does for RGS9 GAP activity on Gαt. These data provide important insights into the regulation of GRK2 and p63RhoGEF by both Gαq and RGS proteins in vivo. Purification of RGS2 and ΔN-RGS2—cDNA encoding human RGS2 and an amino-terminal deletion of RGS2 (ΔN-RGS2, spanning amino acid residues 72–211) were cloned into the pMALc2H10T vector (51.Kristelly R. Earnest B.T. Krishnamoorthy L. Tesmer J.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1859-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) using the BamHI and SalI restriction sites. The proteins were expressed as tobacco etch virus protease-cleavable maltose-binding protein fusion proteins. All purification steps were performed at 4 °C or on ice. Induced Rosetta (DE3) pLys cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) plus 1 μm leupeptin, 1 mm lima bean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were lysed with an Avestin C3 homogenizer, ultracentrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 1 h using a Beckman Type Ti 45 rotor, and then loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. Maltose-binding protein-RGS2 was eluted with lysis buffer containing 150 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and then treated with 2% (w/w) tobacco etch virus protease and dialyzed against lysis buffer overnight. The dialyzed protein was passed back over a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column equilibrated with lysis buffer to remove His-tagged maltose-binding protein and uncut fusion protein. RGS2 was then concentrated in a 30-kDa Centriprep (Millipore) and further purified using two tandem Superdex S200 columns (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl and 5 mm DTT. Some of the RGS2 used in these studies was produced from a His10-RGS2 vector (a gift from Scott Heximer, University of Toronto). Purification of His10-RGS2 was as previously described (52.Heximer S.P. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 390: 65-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Purification of Other Proteins—A Gαi/q chimera, in which the amino-terminal helix of Gαq is replaced with that of Gαi (36.Tesmer V.M. Kawano T. Shankaranarayanan A. Kozasa T. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2005; 310: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), a fragment of human p63RhoGEF spanning residues 149–502 (henceforth referred to as p63RhoGEF), GRK2, and RGS4 were purified as previously described (9.Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Lutz S. Shankaranarayanan A. Coco C. Ridilla M. Nance M.R. Vettel C. Baltus D.

Tesmer J.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 936-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A construct expressing a fragment of RGS4 analogous to ΔN-RGS2 (ΔN-RGS4, spanning amino acid residues 51–205) was created in pMALc2H10T using the EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites. The overexpressed protein was purified essentially as described for RGS2 except using 100 instead of 500 mm NaCl. Point mutants RGS2-N149D, RGS4-N128G, GRK2-D110A, and p63RhoGEF-F471E were purified as described for their respective wild-type proteins. Purification of Gαi/qR183C was performed as described for Gαi/q with the following modifications. The nickel-column eluate was supplemented with 10% glycerol, and proteins were dialyzed overnight against dialysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 μm GDP, and 10% glycerol) and concentrated to ∼8 mg/ml. Gαi/qR183C was purified on two tandem S200 gel filtration columns pre-equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 μm GDP, and 5% glycerol. Gαi/qR183C was purified to greater than 90% homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE and was concentrated to ∼3 mg/ml and then frozen in tubes on liquid nitrogen in volumes of 5 μl. Flow Cytometry Protein Interaction Assay—Equilibrium binding of either RGS2, RGS4, GRK2, or p63RhoGEF to Gαi/q was measured by flow cytometry protein interaction assay (FCPIA). RGS2 and GRK2 were fluorescently labeled either with amine reactive Alexa Fluor (AF) 532 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester or with the thiol-reactive AF 532 C5-maleimide (Invitrogen). Both probes gave similar results in binding assays. RGS4 and p63RhoGEF were labeled only with the thiol-reactive fluorophore. Gαi/q was initially biotinylated using biotinamidohexanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma) in the form of a Gαi/qβγ heterotrimer, as previously described (27.Lutz S. Shankaranarayanan A. Coco C. Ridilla M. Nance M.R. Vettel C. Baltus D. Evelyn C.R. Neubig R.R. Wieland T. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2007; 318: 1923-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Gαi/q was later biotinylated directly as a monomer because it behaved similarly in binding assays and had the advantage of not requiring separation from Gβγ. Biotinylated Gαi/q (b-Gαi/q, 5 nm) was linked to xMap LumAvidin microspheres (Luminex) and washed 3 times with 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% lubrol, 2 mm DTT, 1% bovine serum albumin, 50 μm GDP plus other additions as indicated. The indicated concentrations of AF 532-labeled protein were then added to bead-bound b-Gαi/q and then allowed to equilibrate for at least 30 min before being processed on a Luminex 96-well plate bead analyzer. For competition studies, unlabeled proteins were added at the concentrations indicated. Longer incubation times (e.g. overnight) did not alter the results, indicating that equilibrium was attained under our assay conditions. The association of AF-labeled protein with beads is reported as the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) for each sample. Each data point was typically measured in duplicate. Direct binding and competition data were fit by nonlinear regression either to one-site binding equations or to an allosteric model using GraphPad Prism (Version 5.0a). Allosteric modulation of AF-GRK2 binding to Gαi/q by RGS proteins was fit using Equations 1 and 2,Y=Y0+NS×[GRK2]+[GRK2]×Bmax[GRK2]+Kd(Eq. 1) where Y is the total fluorescence measured, Y0 is the background fluorescence, NS is the linear increase in fluorescence due to nonspecific binding of AF-GRK2 to beads, and Bmax is the maximum fluorescence change due to specific binding. For all but one of the RGS2 dose-response curves (Fig. 5B), Y0 and NS were directly measured and subtracted from the data to obtain specific binding. For these corrected sets, Y0 and NS were fixed with values of 0. Kd′ is the apparent dissociation constant for AF-GRK2,Kd'=Kd×(KA+[A])(KA+[A]/α)(Eq. 2) where Kd is the dissociation constant of AF-GRK2 in the absence of allosteric modulation, KA is the dissociation constant of allosteric modulator A (i.e. RGS2 or RGS4) in the absence of AF-GRK2, and α is the cooperativity factor (54.Ehlert F.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 33: 187-194PubMed Google Scholar). An α value greater than 1 corresponds to negative allostery. Kd, KA, and α were fit globally from 2–5 separate series of binding saturation curves with automatic outlier rejection as implemented by GraphPad Prism. The dose-response curves were also analyzed using a competitive model wherein the [A]/α term in Equation 2 was deleted. Model comparisons used the F test as implemented by GraphPad Prism. Dissociation Rate of GRK2—To determine koff for GRK2 from b-Gαi/q, 10 nm AF-GRK2 was incubated with bead bound b-Gαi/q for 1 or 24 h at 4 °C. Plates were then allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 30 min, and the dissociation of AF-GRK2 was initiated by adding either unlabeled GRK2 (final concentration 1 μm), GRK2 plus RGS2 (both 1 μm final), or GRK2 plus RGS4 (both 1 μm final). The loss of fluorescence was measured by FCPIA at the indicated time points. Data were fit to a one-phase exponential decay model. Purification of an RGS4-Gαi/q-p63RhoGEF-RhoA Complex—Gαi/q and a 1.25 m excess of p63RhoGEF and a 2 m excess of RGS4 were incubated on ice for 30 min in the presence of 20 μm AlCl3 and 10 mm NaF. Total protein concentration was greater than 5 mg/ml. RGS4-Gαi/q-p63RhoGEF complexes thus formed were gel-filtered through a 2-ml desalting spin column (Zeba™) to remove excess GDP. RhoA was incubated with 10 mm EDTA on ice for 30 min, and buffer was exchanged with a 0.5-ml spin column to form GDP-free RhoA. The RGS4-Gαi/q-p63RhoGEF complex was then incubated with 1.5 m excess of GDP-free RhoA on ice for 15 min and then resolved on two tandem Superdex 200 10/300 gel filtration columns pre-equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 μm EDTA, 20 μm AlCl3, and 10 mm NaF. RGS Protein Pulldown Assays—Mutations in Gαq were generated in mouse Gαq cDNA in pCMV5, and the mutants were expressed in HEK293 cells as previously described (36.Tesmer V.M. Kawano T. Shankaranarayanan A. Kozasa T. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2005; 310: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). RGS2/RGS4 was biotinylated by incubating with equimolar amounts of biotinamidohexanoyl-6-amino-hexanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma) on ice for 1 h and then filtering the sample through a 0.5-ml spin column (Zeba™). Gαq (wild type or the indicated mutant) cell lysates (100 μl) were incubated with 1 μg of biotinylated RGS2/RGS4 and streptavidin beads (Invitrogen) for 3 h at 4 °C in the presence or absence of 30 μm AlCl3, 10 mm NaF. The beads were then washed 3 times with 500 μl of the lysis buffer (±30 μm AlCl3 and 10 mm NaF as appropriate) and then treated with 5 μl of 4× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Gαq was detected by Western analysis. GAP Assays—GTPase activation assays were conducted as previously described (55.Chidiac P. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19639-19643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Gαi/qR183C (final concentration 1–3 μm) was incubated in a 120-μl GTP mixture (6.25 μm [γ-32P]GTP (30–100 cpm/fmol), 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.9 mm MgSO4, 5.5 mm CHAPS, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, and 37.5 μm (NH4)2SO4) for ∼3 h at 20 °C. [γ-32P]GTP-bound Gαi/qR183C was purified from unbound nucleotide at 4 °C using a 0.5-ml spin column (Zeba™). A sample of this protein was reserved for liquid scintillation counting to calculate specific activity. GTP hydrolysis was performed in an assay buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.9 mm MgSO4, 1 mm GTP, 0.20% (w/v) cholate, and 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 30 μl of the [γ-32P]GTP-loaded Gαi/qR183C to 270 μl of assay buffer at 20 °C either alone or in the presence of additional proteins as indicated. The reaction was terminated at each time point by adding 50 μl of the reaction mix to 750 μl of quench buffer (5% activated charcoal in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 2) on ice. The radioactivity remaining in the supernatant was quantified by liquid scintillation counting of 300 μl of the supernatant. In each assay typically ∼5 nm Gαi/qR183C was estimated as being loaded with [γ-32P]GTP. Nucleotide Exchange Assay—Nucleotide exchange on RhoA was measured as previously described (27.Lutz S. Shankaranarayanan A. Coco C. Ridilla M. Nance M.R. Vettel C. Baltus D. Evelyn C.R. Neubig R.R. Wieland T. Tesmer J.J. Science. 2007; 318: 1923-1927Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) except that the reaction mix (2 μm RhoA, 200 nm p63RhoGEF, 400 nm Gαi/q) and the indicated concentrations of RGS proteins were first equilibrated for 2 h at 4 °C before the addition of 1 μm BODIPY FL GTPγS (Invitrogen). Crystallographic studies demonstrated that GRK2 and p63RhoGEF both engage Gαq in a manner that would appear to allow the binding of the RGS domain of either RGS4 (9.Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or RGS2 (56.Soundararajan M. Willard F.S. Kimple A.J. Turnbull A.P. Ball L.J. Schoch G.A. Gileadi C. Fedorov O.Y. Dowler E.F. Higman V.A. Hutsell S.Q. Sundstrom M. Doyle D.A. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 6457-6462Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) to Gαq without steric overlap (Fig. 1, A and B). Models of these RGS-Gαi/q-effector complexes, thus, resemble the structure of the PDEγ-Gαt/i1-RGS9 complex (Fig. 1C). The positions of the modeled RGS box domains in these complexes are also consistent with the predicted orientation of these complexes at the cell surface in that the membrane binding elements of the RGS proteins are juxtaposed with the phospholipid bilayer. We, therefore, initiated in vitro experiments to confirm the formation of these complexes and to better"
https://openalex.org/W2062237394,"Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP), an inherited disease of heme biosynthesis, is one of the most common types of porphyria. Reduced activity of the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), which catalyzes the sequential condensation of 4 molecules of porphobilinogen to yield preuroporphyrinogen, has been linked to the symptoms of AIP. We have determined the 3-dimensional structure of human PBGD at 2.2 A resolution. Analysis of the structure revealed a dipyrromethane cofactor molecule covalently linked to C261, sitting in a positively charged cleft region. In addition to the critical catalytic D99, a number of other residues are seen hydrogen bonded to the cofactor and play a role in catalysis. Sequential entry of 4 pyrrole molecules into the active site is accomplished by movement of the domains around the hinges. H120P mutation resulted in an inactive enzyme, supporting the role of H120 as a hinge residue. Interestingly, some of the mutations of the human PBGD documented in patients suffering from AIP are located far away from the active site. The structure provides insights into the mechanism of action of PBGD at the molecular level and could aid the development of potential drugs for the up-regulation of PBGD activity in AIP."
https://openalex.org/W1979318103,"Human PP11 (placental protein 11) was previously described as a serine protease specifically expressed in the syncytiotrophoblast and in numerous tumor tissues. Several PP11-like proteins were annotated in distantly related organisms, such as worms and mammals, suggesting their involvement in evolutionarily conserved processes. Based on sequence similarity, human PP11 was included in a protein family whose characterized members are XendoU, a Xenopus laevis endoribonuclease involved in small nucleolar RNA processing, and Nsp15, an endoribonuclease essential for coronavirus replication. Here we show that the bacterially expressed human PP11 displays RNA binding capability and cleaves single stranded RNA in a Mn2+-dependent manner at uridylates, to produce molecules with 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate ends. These features, together with structural and mutagenesis analyses, which identified the potential active site residues, reveal striking parallels to the amphibian XendoU and assign a ribonuclease function to PP11. This newly discovered enzymatic activity places PP11-like proteins in a completely new perspective.

This newly discovered enzymatic activity places PP11-like proteins in a completely new perspective. PP11 (placental protein 11) is one of the five glycoproteins (together with PP8, PP9, PP10, and PP12) that were first isolated from aqueous extracts of human term placentas in the 1980s. Unlike PP8 and PP9, which were found in relatively high concentrations in all tissues analyzed, PP10, PP11, and PP12 were supposed to be specific to the placentas, since they could not be detected in extracts of other human tissues (1.Bohn H. Winckler W. Arch. Gynecol. 1980; 229: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 2.Bohn H. Inaba N. Luben G. Oncodev. Biol. Med. 1981; 2: 141-153PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was shown that the placenta-specific proteins were also expressed in several tumor tissues; PP11 was detected in 66.7% of the analyzed mucinous cystadenocarcinomas and in 57.1% of serous cystadenocarcinomas tested, whereas it was not found in normal ovaries (3.Inaba N. Ishige H. Ijichi M. Satoh N. Ohkawa R. Sekiya S. Shirotake S. Takamizawa H. Renk T. Bohn H. Oncodev. Biol. Med. 1982; 3: 379-389PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, PP11 was also found in 47% of all breast cancers examined (4.Inaba N. Renk T. Daume E. Bohn H. Arch. Gynecol. 1981; 231: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and in 38% of all testicular and gastric cancers studied (5.Inaba N. Renk T. Wurster K. Rapp W. Bohn H. Klin. Wochenschr. 1980; 58: 789-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These results suggested that this protein may be involved in carcinogenesis and, therefore, may represent a suitable molecular marker for tumor diagnosis. A putative function for PP11 was proposed in 1990, when the cDNA was isolated from a placental cDNA library and the encoded protein was expressed in Escherichia coli; two different forms, a precursor of 45 kDa and a mature protein of 42 kDa, were produced. Employing a colorimetric assay on purified placental protein and on periplasmic and cytoplasmic fractions of extracts prepared from E. coli, containing the 42- and 45-kDa proteins, respectively, a putative serine protease activity was assigned to the placental and to the recombinant 42-kDa proteins (6.Grundmann U. Romisch J. Siebold B. Bohn H. Amann E. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Another piece of information, which may contribute to the understanding of PP11 biological role, derives from its subcellular localization; PP11 was exclusively localized in the cytoplasm of syncytiotrophoblast (7.Inaba N. Renk E. Bohn H. Arch. Gynecol. 1980; 230: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Since then, PP11 has not been subjected to further characterization, validating its protease activity and investigating its natural substrates. Recently, PP11 has been identified as a member of the “XendoU family,” a novel protein class including several enzymes that share a significant sequence homology with the founding member XendoU (8.Snjider E.J. Bredenbeek P.J. Dobbe J.C. Thiel V. Ziebuhr J. Poon L.L.M. Rozanov Y.G.M. Spaan W.J.M. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, 9.Renzi F.

This enzyme is an amphibian endoribonuclease that participates in the biosynthesis of small nucleolar RNAs, a class of noncoding RNAs involved in ribosome biogenesis (10.Caffarelli E. Arese M.

Notably, even if the specific substrate of Nsp15 has not yet been identified, an essential role for this protein in virus replication and transcription was established (13.Ivanov K.A. Hertzig T.

Guarino L. Kao C.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 361: 243-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Within the XendoU family, PP11 is highly conserved both in vertebrates and in invertebrates (11.Laneve P. Altieri F. Fiori M.E. Scaloni A. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13026-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The finding that the human protein shares both a high sequence homology (38% identity and 55% similarity) and a predicted secondary structure with XendoU (9.Renzi F. Caffarelli E. Laneve P.

To delve into its function, we expressed a recombinant histidine-tagged PP11 (His-PP11) and employed the purified protein to investigate several aspects concerning its enzymatic activity, biochemical properties, and cellular localization. Here we show that PP11 has RNA binding activity, whereas it does not display the predicted serine protease function; it proved to be an endoribonuclease sharing the main biochemical features (i.e. ion requirement, cleavage site specificity, and released products) with the RNases belonging to the same family. Furthermore, homology modeling in parallel with site-directed mutagenesis allowed us to determine the residues crucial for its catalytic activity. Proteolytic Activity Assay—Proteolytic activity was determined by a chromogenic assay with Chromozyme TH (Roche Applied Science), following the variation of absorbance at 405 nm. Other hydrolase activities were measured using 2 mm p-nitrophenyl acetate (15.Krisch K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 122: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and 5 mm glycine p-nitroanilide as substrates, both in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and following the variation of absorbance at 405 and 435 nm, respectively. For each assay, aliquots of protein, containing 1–20 μg, were employed, and the reactions were carried out at 37 °C in the presence or absence of different cations. Thrombin from bovine plasma (Roche Applied Science) and rabbit liver esterase (Sigma) were used as reference activity. Homology Modeling and Docking—The PP11 sequence (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry P21128) was retrieved from the ExPASy (Expert Protein Analysis System) World Wide Web server and then was submitted to the HHpred and the Swiss-Model homology model World Wide Web servers. Both of the servers identified the XendoU structure as the most suitable to generate the PP11 three-dimensional model; therefore, it was selected as the three-dimensional template (Protein Data Bank code 2c1w). The generation of the PP11 three-dimensional models was run using the default options in both of the homology model servers. Due to steric hindrance that is generated upon hydrogen addition, the two models were geometrically optimized using the AMBER 8 molecular modeling suite. To this the HHpred and the Swiss-Model models in turn were solvated (SOLVATEOCT command) in a box extending 10 Å with 7977 (Swiss-Model) or 12151 (HHpred) water molecules (TIP3 model) and neutralized with eight Na+ ions. The solvated complex was then refined by minimization (5000 iterations) using the SANDER module of AMBER. For the graphical inspection of the minimized models and image production, Chimera 1.2470 (University of California, San Francisco) was used. The secondary structure of the oligoribonucleotide P1 (GGAACGUAUCCUUUGGGAG) was calculated with the mfold program (available on the World Wide Web) with the default setting. Next, a limited version of the Mc-Sym program (available on the World Wide Web) was run to generate the three-dimensional models of the predicted stem-loop structural motifs present in two mfold-suggested P1 secondary structures (RNA1 and RNA2). The docking studies were performed by means of the Autodock 3.0.5 program using a grid spacing of 0.375 Å and 80 × 80 × 80 points that embraced almost half of the protein. The grid was centered on the mass center of the corresponding XendoU experimental bound phosphate. The Genetic Algorithm Local Search method was adopted using the default setting, except that the maximum number of energy evaluations was increased from 250,000 to 2,500,000. Autodock generated 100 possible binding conformations for each molecule that were clustered using a tolerance of 2.0 Å. The AutoDockTool graphical interface was used to prepare the enzyme PDBQS file. The protein atom charges as calculated during the complex minimization were retained for the docking calculations. In the docking of the two RNA substrates, no bonds were allowed to rotate. The GU and UU dinucleotides were built, starting from ASCII text, using the stand alone version of PRODRG, in conjunction with the GROMACS suite. The dockings of the UU and GU dinucleotides were conducted allowing rotation of all rotatable bonds. Oligonucleotides—The following DNA oligonucleotides, purchased from Sigma, were used for cloning the different constructs: START, 5′-TCCCCCGGGTGAGGACCACAAAGAGTCAGAG-3′; STOP, 5′-CCCAAGCTTTTAGGTGGAAGACACTATGTAGGC-3′; E243fw, 5′-CAACATGTCTTCTCAGGTGAGG-3′; E243rev, 5′-AAAGCCACTCGAGTCCCC-3′; H244fw, 5′-GTCTTCTCAGGTGAGGTAAAAAAAGG-3′; H244rev, 5′-AGCTTCAAAGCCACTCGAGTCCC-3′; E249fw, 5′-CAGGTAAAAAAAGGCAAGGTTACTGGC-3′; E249rev, 5′-ACCTGAGAAGACATGTTCAAAGCC-3′; H259fw, 5′-GCTAACTGGATCCGCTTCTACC-3′; H259rev, 5′-GAAGCCAGTAACCTTGCC-3′; K302fw, 5′-GCGGAAGTGGGCTCTGCTTTCATCG-3′; K302rev, 5′-ATAGTAGCCGTCCCAGTTGAACTGC-3′. Cloning and Expression of His-PP11 and Its Mutant Derivatives—PP11 open reading frame was amplified from I.M.A.G.E. cDNA 8 Digit Clone 30915175 (MRC Geneservice, Cambridge, UK) by standard PCR, employing the synthetic oligonucleotides START and STOP and cloned downstream of the His6 tag coding sequence in the pQE30 expression vector (r-hPP11). The plasmids expressing His-PP11 mutant derivatives were realized by inverse PCR on an r-hPP11 construct with the oligonucleotides indicated in parentheses: E243Q (E243fw, E243rev), H244A (H244fw, H244rev), E249Q (E249fw, E249rev), H259A (H259fw, H259rev), and K302A (K302fw, K302rev). All recombinant proteins were expressed in the E. coli M15 (pREP4) strain and purified by affinity chromatography as already described for XendoU (12.Gioia U. Laneve P. Dlakic M. Arceci M. Bozzoni I.

In Vitro RNA Transcription, Binding, and Processing Reactions—The U16-containing precursor (mini 003 RNA) template was utilized for in vitro transcription according to Melton et al. (17.Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar) and employed in binding assays (12.Gioia U. Laneve P. Dlakic M. Arceci M. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18996-19002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). All of the oligoribonucleotide substrates were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated with different amounts of His-PP11 (wild type or mutant versions), using conditions described by Laneve et al. (11.Laneve P. Altieri F. Fiori M.E. Scaloni A. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13026-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Processing products were analyzed on 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels. Double-stranded RNAs were obtained by denaturing labeled P2 oligonucleotide and incubating it with its cold counterpart in a molar ratio of 1:3 for 1 h at 37 °C in the processing buffer (5 mm MnCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Amersham Biosciences)). Proper formation of double-stranded RNA was verified on nondenaturing gels. The nucleotide RNA ladder was obtained by incubation of labeled oligonucleotides in 500 mm NaHCO3 at 90 °C for 20 min. Analysis of 3′ Termini—Gel-purified 5′-terminal cleavage product (derived by cleavage at the UU↓U stretch of P1 oligonucleotide) was incubated in 30 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 15 mm MgCl2, and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) for 45 min at 37 °C to remove the 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate (18.Pan T. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3887-3895Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As a negative control, RNA was treated with the indicated kinase buffer alone or with alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science). After extraction and labeling in the presence of 5′-[32P]cytidine 3′,5′-bisphosphate (PerkinElmer Life Science) and T4 RNA ligase (New England Biolabs) for 5 h at 16 °C, RNA was analyzed on 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel. Purification of Anti-His-PP11 Antibodies—Anti-His-PP11 serum was obtained by immunization of rabbits (Primm, Milano, Italy) with the purified recombinant protein. Specific antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography using recombinant His-PP11 immobilized onto Affi-gel 10 (Bio-Rad). IgGs were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 3, neutralized with phosphate buffer, pH 8, and utilized in immunofluorescence and Western blot experiments. Processing of Placental Samples and BeWo Cells for Immunofluorescence—Normal term placentas were obtained with local research and ethics committee approval. Small fragments were immediately excised at random sites, briefly rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline to remove blood excess, and fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde for 4 h. Samples were then infused in 12–18% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline as cryoprotectant prior to liquid nitrogen freezing in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek Europe, Zoeterwoude, Netherlands). 6-μm cryosections were cut, mounted on SuperFrost-Plus glass slides (Menzel-Glaser, Brauschweig, Germany), air-dried, and then treated with 1 m glycine for 20 min and with 5% donkey serum, 5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h. Purified anti-His-PP11 antibodies were used at 1:300 dilution (overnight incubation at 4 °C) and revealed with 1:300 Alexa Fluor 594 donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The specificity of immunolabeling was verified in control samples prepared with the primary antibody omitted. The sections were counterstained with 1.5 mg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in Vectashield Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and analyzed in a Zeiss microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped with epifluorescence. BeWo choriocarcinoma cells (CCL-98; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained at 37 °C, under 5% CO2, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 + GLUTAMAX™ 1:1 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For immunofluorescent studies, cells were grown on glass coverslips to confluence, rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and fixed for 15 min at 4 °C in freshly prepared formaldehyde (10%). The cells were processed for immunostaining as previously described for placental cryosections. Western Blot Analysis—Small placental fragments, of about 300 mg, were directly frozen in liquid nitrogen. For protein extract preparation, the samples were thawed out, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm EDTA, pH 8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS) with Ultra-Turrax for 15–20 s on ice and incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. After centrifugation at 3000 relative centrifuge force at 4 °C for 10 min, the supernatant was stored at –20 °C. Extracts from BeWo cells were collected in radioimmune precipitation buffer. The extracts were fractionated onto NuPAGE 10% polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen), blotted onto Protran nitrocellulose membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and reacted overnight with purified anti-His-PP11 antibodies (1:2500 in TBS, 1% Tween 20). Bioinformatic Analysis—RNA secondary structures were predicted by the RNA mfold version 3.2 Web server (19.Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10409) Google Scholar). Structures with the lowest initial ΔG were selected. Histograms were generated by densitometric analyses performed employing ImageQuant TL version 2005 software (Amersham Biosciences). The apparent Kd (Kd′) was calculated according to the equation, Kd′ = [proteinfree] × [RNAfree]/[protein-RNA] (20.Roberts S.A. Ramsden D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10605-10613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and binding curves were best fit with Sigma Plot 10 using a sigmoidal dose-response curve. PP11 Has No Detectable Serine Protease Activity—PP11 was previously isolated, thanks to its high levels of expression in the syncytiotrophoblast. We cloned a full-length PP11 cDNA fused to a His tag and purified the expressed 42-kDa protein in E. coli (His-PP11). In parallel, antibodies against the recombinant protein were generated, purified by affinity chromatography, tested on placental and BeWo cell protein extracts, and employed for immunofluorescence studies. These analyses indicated that the antibodies specifically recognized the His-PP11 protein as well as the two forms of the placental protein and confirmed the reported abundant expression of PP11 in syncytiotrophoblast (7.Inaba N. Renk E. Bohn H. Arch. Gynecol. 1980; 230: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1). Our previous PP11 homology modeling did not reveal any evidence for a catalytic triad that could account for its putative serine protease activity; the residues His162, Ser157, and Glu161 (or Asp156) tend to cluster, but their stereochemistry does not conform to the canonical triad (9.Renzi F. Caffarelli E. Laneve P. Bozzoni I. Brunori M. Vallone B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 12365-12370Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To unequivocally establish PP11 enzymatic activity as a protease and/or as esterase, the recombinant protein was employed in the amidolytic assay described by Grundmann et al. (6.Grundmann U. Romisch J. Siebold B. Bohn H. Amann E. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The level of protease activity was undetectable by chromogenic assay on Chromozyme TH at all of the protein concentrations tested (Fig. 1). Supporting this result, no amidase activity was observed using glycine p-nitroanilide as substrate (not shown). A very low hydrolytic activity (less than 0.002 μmol min–1 mg–1) was observed toward p-nitrophenyl acetate, indicating its preferential esterase activity (Fig. 1). PP11 Homology Modeling—The sequence and secondary structure conservation of PP11 with XendoU endoribonuclease suggests an RNase activity for the human protein (9.Renzi F. Caffarelli E. Laneve P. Bozzoni I. Brunori M. Vallone B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 12365-12370Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 12.Gioia U. Laneve P. Dlakic M. Arceci M. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18996-19002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To support this prediction, we performed a homology-modeling analysis on PP11, based on the XendoU crystallographic structure (9.Renzi F. Caffarelli E. Laneve P. Bozzoni I. Brunori M. Vallone B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 12365-12370Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Two three-dimensional models were automatically generated, employing two of the most widely used publicly available homology model Web servers, namely the Swiss-Model (21.Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4536) Google Scholar) and the HHpred (22.Soding J. Biegert A. Lupas A.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W244-W248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2687) Google Scholar). Both of the homology model servers identified the experimental three-dimensional structure of XendoU (Protein Data Bank code 2c1w) as the most appropriate template, with an identity sequence score of about 40%. The two homology models were quite superimposable (root mean square deviation = 0.532 over 168 residue pairs), except for a flap region, located between Gly248 and Asn260 (corresponding to Gly166–Asn179 in XendoU) that is endowed with a certain flexibility. Inspection of the two models in comparison with the experimental three-dimensional structure of the template highlighted that the HHpred-derived PP11 model conserved the flap region in an open position, whereas the Swiss-model PP11 structure displayed a closed switched flap (Fig. 2, a and b, and supplemental Fig. 2). In XendoU, the flap is kept opened by a hydrogen bonding net established between the side chains of Glu167, Gln172, and Lys220 (supplemental Fig. 3); such a flap region was detected to accommodate a phosphate group in XendoU experimental structure, suggesting this as the putative RNA binding site (9.Renzi F. Caffarelli E. Laneve P. Bozzoni I. Brunori M. Vallone B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 12365-12370Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the modeled PP11, only the Glu249 residue, corresponding to the XendoU-Glu167 residue, is conserved, whereas counterparts of XendoU-Gln172 and -Lys220 change to Lys254 and Asp298, respectively; as a consequence, the absence of the hydrogen bonding network could explain the enhanced flexibility of the PP11 Gly248-Asn260 loop (supplemental Figs. 3 and 4). These modeling data allow us to speculate that the HHpred structural model represents the active state of the PP11 enzyme in which a putative RNA-binding domain can be recognized. We employed this structural model for further inspection of the possible enzyme/substrate interactions. PP11 Interacts with RNA—The ability of the protein to interact with a RNA substrate was tested by in vitro binding assays. For this purpose, increased concentrations of His-PP11 were incubated with a fixed amount of 32P-labeled mini 003 RNA that represents a short version of the XendoU natural substrate (12.Gioia U. Laneve P. Dlakic M. Arceci M. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 18996-19002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); we chose this molecule, since it displays the appropriate length, allowing the formation of stable RNA-protein complexes. The assembled complex was visualized by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig. 3A). In order to exclude the possibility that the His tag contributed to the RNA binding activity of PP11, a control binding experiment with an unrelated His tag fusion protein (acetyl-CoA synthetase) with no reported affinity for nucleic acids was performed. Only a very minor nonspecific interaction was detected, summing up to no more than 2% of input RNA (supplemental Fig. 5). The substrate affinity of PP11 and XendoU toward RNA was determined by measuring the apparent dissociation constant (Kd′). The estimated Kd′ was equal to 140 nm for PP11 and 920 nm for XendoU, suggesting a higher RNA affinity for the human protein compared with the Xenopus enzyme (Fig. 3B). RNA-protein interaction was further investigated through docking experiments, conducted by means of the Autodock program, (23.Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9301) Google Scholar), using the HHpred PP11 modeled structure. For such an experiment, we employed the sequence corresponding to the oligoribonucleotide P1 (GGAACGUAUCCUUUGGGAG) that contains a natural cleavage site of XendoU (11.Laneve P. Altieri F. Fiori M.E. Scaloni A. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13026-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). At first, two secondary structures of the oligoribonucleotide (supplemental Fig. 6) were generated, as suggested by the mfold program (19.Zuker M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3406-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (10409) Google Scholar). The predicted stem-loop structural motifs present in both secondary structures were selected to produce RNA1 (GAACGUAU; supplemental Fig. 6, left) and RNA2 (CCUUUGGG; supplemental Fig. 6, right) three-dimensional models by the Mc-Sym program (24.Pinard R. Lambert D. Walter N.G. Heckman J.E. Major F. Burke J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16035-16039Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The Autodock-suggested RNA1-PP11 and RNA2-PP11 complexes (supplemental Fig. 7), although not overlapping each other, are relatively near to the flexible flap and close to the phosphate residue experimentally found in the XendoU structure (9.Renzi F. Caffarelli E. Laneve P. Bozzoni I. Brunori M. Vallone B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 12365-12370Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the PP11 Gly248–Asn260 loop region is involved in RNA binding. PP11 Has an Endoribonuclease Activity—To investigate the RNase activity of PP11, a collection of synthetic oligoribonucleotides was employed. All of them derived from P1, the oligonucleotide containing the UUU upstream distal cleavage site of XendoU; they are P2, P3, and P4, in which the UUU stretch is substituted by UU, UCU, and UGU sequences, respectively (see Fig. 4) (11.Laneve P. Altieri F. Fiori M.E. Scaloni A. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13026-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These molecules represent suitable substrates for testing both the ribonucleolytic activity and the sequence specificity of the enzyme. The processing assay consisted in the incubation of the affinity-purified His-PP11 with 32P-labeled oligoribonucleotides under the conditions already set up for XendoU activity (11.Laneve P. Altieri F. Fiori M.E. Scaloni A. Bozzoni I. Caffarelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13026-13032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The reaction was carried out in the presence of manganese both at 24 °C, the temperature utilized for XendoU activity assay, and at 37 °C; since no differences were detected (not shown), all of the following assays were performed at 24 °C"

https://openalex.org/W2025005626,"γ-Synuclein (Syn G) is highly expressed in retinal ganglion cells and the loss of these cells in glaucoma is associated with significant reduction of the intracellular Syn G level. However, a causative relationship between these two events has not been established. Here we show that the knockdown of Syn G results in a decreased viability of the immortalized retinal ganglion cells (RGC-5). The Syn G silencing reduces phosphorylation of serine 112 (Ser112) in Bad protein, a member of the Bcl-2 family that plays a critical role in apoptotic cell death signaling. Our gene expression analysis data suggests that changes in Bad phosphorylation status may be caused by a coordinated shift in activities of kinases controlling Bad phosphorylation and phosphatases catalyzing its dephosphorylation. Moreover, increased phosphorylation of Bad-sequestering protein 14-3-3 detected in these cells is also pro-apoptotic. These results suggest that the homeostatic level of Syn G in RGC-5 cells is required for transcriptional regulation of protein kinases and phosphatases, controlling phosphorylation of Bad and 14-3-3. Lowering Syn G causes Bad dephosphorylation, dissociation from phosphorylated 14-3-3, and translocation to mitochondria where it initiates apoptotic death cascade. γ-Synuclein (Syn G) is highly expressed in retinal ganglion cells and the loss of these cells in glaucoma is associated with significant reduction of the intracellular Syn G level.

Res. 2002; 68: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The reduction of Syn G in RGC may have vital consequences for these cells, because Syn G is involved in cellular signaling and modulates the level of transcription of selected genes (27Surgucheva I.

Cytoskeleton. 2001; 49: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the reduction of Syn G in RGC initiates the changes leading to glaucomatous alterations or it is just a result of the upstream biochemical processes that take place in glaucoma. The role of Syn G in the regulation of kinases and signaling pathways is well established (28Surguchov A. Palazzo R.E. Surgucheva I. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2001; 49: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 29Gupta A. Inaba S. Wong O.K. Fang G. Liu J.

In this study, we used siRNA knockdown of Syn G as an approach to mimic this protein decrease observed in the RGCs affected by glaucoma. Experimental silencing of Syn G in RGC-5 cells resulted in decreased cell viability and correlated with the reduction of Bad phosphorylation and the increase in 14-3-3 phosphorylation. Given the level of phosphorylation these proteins serve as an important survival/death checkpoint in RGC, potentially critical for their loss in glaucoma (31Huang W. Fileta J.B. Dobberfuhl A.

Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2008; 49: 2483-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), it is feasible to suggest that a decrease in Syn G causes this dys-regulation. The changes in Bad and 14-3-3 phosphorylation may be a result of misbalance in the expression of kinases and phosphatases in Syn G-silenced cells. Cell Culture—The transformed rat RGC line, RGC-5 (33Krishnamoorthy R.R. Agarwal P. Prasanna G. Vopat K. Lambert W. Sheedlo H.J. Pang I.H. Shade D. Wordinger R.J. Yorio T. Clark A.F. Agarwal N.

Cells were maintained in growth medium containing low-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma) in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 at 37 °C, as described previously (33Krishnamoorthy R.R.

This retroviral vector ensures efficient siRNA expression using H1 RNA polymerase III promoter, which drives the endogenous production of siRNA. For oligonucleotide design the software from Dharmacon and Whitehead Institute were used. The designed oligonucleotides correspond to different parts of the rat Syn G gene, including exons 3 and 4 (E3 and E4) and 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) (Table 1). As a control, scrambled (Scr) nucleotide sequence corresponding to E3 was used. The scrambled sequence has the same nucleotide composition as the input sequence and does not possess a significant homology to other genes, according to BLAST analysis. Each double strand oligo contained the BglII site on 5′- and 3′-end on the HindIII. The oligonucleotides for candidate siRNAs were analyzed by BLAST search to exclude considerable similarity to other genes. Oligonucleotides were inserted into pSUPER vector by ligation using BglII and HindIII sites as recommended by the manufacturer (Oligoengine, Inc.). Further steps (annealing, linearization, cloning the annealed oligonucleotides into the vector, and transformation of Escherichia coli) were performed according to the manufacturer's protocols. The correctness of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing. On the next step, pSUPER.retro.plasmids were transfected into 293T cells together with a packaging plasmid pCLEco (Imgenex, San Diego, CA) using FUGENE-HD transfection reagent (Roche). Transfection into 293T cells was performed following the manufacturer's protocol. The cells (105/ml) were split into 60-mm plates with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and grown overnight. Before transfection the media was changed to a fresh one. DNA was incubated with FUGENE-HD (ratio 3:2, 30 min, room temperature) to form a complex. Each mixture contained 1.5 μg of pSUPER-plasmid DNA and 0.5 μg of pCLeo DNA. After incubation the mixture was added to cells in the media containing fetal bovine serum without antibiotics. In 48 h the fluorescence was analyzed using the Bio-Rad Microradians Plus confocal system coupled to a Nikon Eclipse inverted microscope TE300 (Melville, NY). The efficiency of transfection was ∼50%. The media from the 293T cells containing the virus together with 10 μg/ml of Polybrene (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA) were used for the infection of RGC-5. After 24 h of growth the efficiency of infection determined as described above was ∼30%. Because pSUPER plasmid contained green fluorescent protein encoding nucleotide sequence, we used flow cytometry (BD-FACSAria Cell Sorting System, BD Biosciences) to enrich the population of cell containing siRNA.TABLE 1Sequences of oligonucleotides used for small interfering RNAsOligo toSense strandAntisense strandmRNA targetScrambledGCTGGCGGACCGATAAAGTTTACTTTATCGGTCCGCCAGCTTGCUGGCGGACCGAUAAAGUExon 4GGAGGCCAAAGAGCAAGAGTTCTCTTGCTCTTTGGCCTCCTTGGAGGCCAAAGAGCAAGAG3′-UTRGCCCAATGCACAAGCCTATTTATAGGCTTGTGCATTGGGCTTGCCCAAUGCACAAGCCUAUExon 3GGCCAATGCCGTGAGTGAATTTTCACTCACGGCATTGGCCTTGGCCAAUGCCGUGAGUGAA Open table in a new tab Cell Viability—Cell viability was assessed using the “Quick Cell Proliferation Assay Kit” (BioVision Research Products, Mountain View, CA). The cells were split into 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 104–105 cells/well in triplicate and incubated overnight. Then the media was changed to a fresh one containing a cytotoxic agent and incubated as indicated in the legend to Fig. 2. 10 μl of WST-1/Electro Coupling Solution was added to each well and the incubation continued for an additional 4 h at 37 °C. The formazan dye produced by viable cells was quantified by measuring the absorbance of the dye solution at 470 and 650 nm using a microtiter plate reader (BioTek Synergy HT-K24, Winooski, VT). Cell viability was assessed in the presence of the following toxic agents: etoposide and staurosporine (Sigma), 4-hydroxylnonenal (HNE, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI), and hydrogen peroxide (Sigma). Preparation of Cell Lysates—Cells grown in 75-cm2 flask were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and suspended in 0.5 ml of boiling 1× cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1% SDS-Na). Then the cells were scraped off the flask, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, heated in water bath at 95 °C for 30 s, and sonicated three times on ice for 5 s each. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 14,000 × g, at 4 °C, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The amount of total protein in cell lysates was determined using BCA (Sigma) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Western Blotting—For the analysis of Syn G expression, the cells were disrupted by ultrasonic treatment and the extracts analyzed by Western blot in 12% polyacrylamide gels. 30 μg of total protein were loaded on each well. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-FL transfer membrane with 0.45 μm pore size (Millipore, Chelmsford, MA). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by immersing the membrane in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 10% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker. For quantitative imaging of films Kodak Image Station 440CF (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) and Kodak Digital Science Image Analysis Software were used. Other details are described in our previous publications (26Surgucheva I. McMahan B. Ahmed F. Tomarev S. Wax M.B. Surguchov A. J. Neurosci.

Cytoskeleton. 2001; 49: 218-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Antibodies for Western Blot and Immunoprecipitation—The following antibodies were used for Western blot: Syn G rabbit polyclonal Ab from ABCam (Ab 6169, Cambridge, MA), dilution 1:1,000; Bad, rabbit mAb 9628 (Cell signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), dilution 1:40; phospho-BAD-Ser112-7E11 mouse monoclonal antibody 9296 from Cell Signaling Technology, dilution 1:1,000; 14-3-3P affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (Phosphosolutions, Aurora, CA), dilution 1:1,000; 14-3-3-β/ζ monoclonal antibody from QED Bioscience Inc. (San Diego, CA), dilution 1:500; Bcl-XL (13.6), rabbit polyclonal Ab (gift of Dr. L. H. Boise, University of Miami, FL), dilution 1:500; anti-cytochrome oxidase (Cox) subunit IV, monoclonal 20E8 (Invitrogen), dilution 1:5,000; α-tubulin, monoclonal antibody (clone DM1/a, ascites fluid, Sigma), dilution 1:10,000. The following antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA): c-Jun (N), rabbit polyclonal Sc-45, dilution 1:400; JNK1 (F3), mouse monoclonal Sc-1648, dilution 1:250; Bad (K-17) Sc-942, dilution 1:400; Bax (YTH6A7), mouse monoclonal, Sc-80658, dilution 1:250; Bcl2, mouse monoclonal antibody Sc-7382, dilution 1:500. Immunoprecipitation—200 μl of cell lysate in RIPA buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS-Na, 1% Triton, 1% deoxycholate) were mixed with 2 μg of Bad antibody 11E3 (rabbit monoclonal from Cell Signaling Technology) and incubated with gentle shaking overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) (20 μl of 50% bead slurry) were added and incubated with gentle shaking for 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged for 30 s at 4 °C and the pellets were washed five times with 500 μl of 1× cell lysis buffer. The pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of 3× SDS sample buffer, mixed by vortexing, and then centrifuged for 30 s. The samples were heated at 95–100 °C for 2–5 min and centrifuged for 1 min at 14,000 × g. 20 μl of the supernatants were loaded on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel for Western blot. Isolation of Mitochondria-rich Fraction—A mitochondria-rich fraction was isolated as described previously (35Morales A.A. Gutman D. Lee K.P. Boise L.H. Blood. 2008; 111: 5152-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, RGC-5 cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted at 500 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Cell pellets were homogenized in isotonic buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 300 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with the protease inhibitor mixture diluted 1:7 (Roche). Homogenates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was centrifuged again at 500 × g for 5 min to remove all the remaining unbroken cells and nuclei. The resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to obtain the mitochondria-rich fraction and the supernatant was considered as the cytosolic fraction. RNA Extraction and Quality Control—RNA was isolated from 4 × 106 cultured RGC-5 cells with RNeasy Protect Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using spin columns and stored at -80 °C. The isolated RNA was quantified by spectrophotometric absorbance considering that 1 unit at 260 nm in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, corresponds to 44 μg of RNA/ml. Only samples with an A260/A280 ratio higher than 1.9 were used. The integrity of RNA was checked by denaturing 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of formaldehyde. Ribosomal RNAs appeared as sharp bands and the ratio of 28 S rRNA to 18 S rRNA quantified under UV light with Kodak Image Station 440CF (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) was equal to 2:1. The RNA was converted into cDNA using the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit with random primers (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) following the recommendations of the manufacturer and was treated by DNase. The concentrations of RNA in samples were equalized to 300 ng/μl. A minus reverse transcriptase (RT) control containing all the reaction components except the reverse transcriptase was included in all qRT-PCR experiments to test genomic DNA contamination. RNA Amplification, Labeling, and Array Hybridization—Amplification was performed using the Amino Allyl Message-Amp™ Kit (Ambion) that is configured to incorporate the modified nucleotide 5-(3-aminoallyl)-UTP (aaUTP) into the aRNA during in vitro transcription, as described previously (17Ivanov D. Dvoriantchikova G. Nathanson L. McKinnon S.J. Shestopalov V.I. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Prior to amplification, the RNA quality was tested in each sample using the NanoDrop and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Each of the two compared samples of amplified RNAs from control and silenced RGC-5 cells was labeled with Cy-3 and Cy-5 dye (Amersham Biosciences). Once purified and fragmented, the dye-labeled amplified RNA was used for microarray hybridization. Equivalent amounts of the two compared experimental amplified RNAs were hybridized with the Agilent Rat Oligo Microarrays (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) using dye-swap design according to the manufacturer's instructions. Microarray Profiling—Agilents two-color Genomic Rat Oligo microarrays that represent ∼41,000 rat genes and transcripts were used to analyze changes in global gene expression induced by siRNA silencing of the Syn G gene in the RGC-5. Hybridization was carried out in SureHyb chambers. A total of four replicates (two biological and two technical) were performed using a dye-swap design to eliminate the “dye bias” error. Data analysis included filtration, normalization, and signal quality control, and was carried out at an Agilent-certified Microarray Facility. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot were used to validate changes in gene expression levels. Differentially expressed genes with changes exceeding 1.3-fold at the FDR < 1% were identified, clustered based on their functions, and analyzed for relative enrichment on generic pathway maps using Metacore Analytical software and data base (Genego Inc., St. Joseph, MI). Microarray Data Processing and Analysis—For the purpose of gene expression comparison each array was normalized for signal intensities across the whole array and locally, using the Lowess normalization (36Yang Y.H. Dudoit S. Luu P. Lin D.M. Peng V. Ngai J. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (2834) Google Scholar). We analyzed only those genes that passed several Agilent-recommended quality control criteria, as described previously (17Ivanov D. Dvoriantchikova G. Nathanson L. McKinnon S.J. Shestopalov V.I. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine differential gene expression, the “naïve RGC-5/reference RNA” ratios were divided by the ratios of “silenced RGC-5/reference RNA.” One class significance analysis of microarrays with FDR < 1% and -fold change of 2.0 was used to determine genes with consistent differences in expression (37Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (9802) Google Scholar, 38Khatri P. Draghici S. Ostermeier G.C. Krawetz S.A. Genomics. 2002; 79: 266-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Our final list of significantly changed genes was obtained by application of one class significance analysis of microarrays (FDR < 1%) to identify genes with consistent ratios of naïve RGC-5/silenced RGC-5. qRT-PCR—Relative quantification was performed as described by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems) with TaqMan reagents starter kit for a two-step qRT-PCR. The following probes (Applied Biosystems) specific for rat mRNAs were used to validate the gene array data: periostin, Rn00580566_m1; Kcnh2, Rn 00588515_m1; Sema 3A, Rn00436469_m1; Gap43, Rn00567901_m1; Fbn1, Rn00582774_m1; Wilms tumor 1 (Wt-1), Rn00580566_m1; Pim-3, Rn00575067_m1; MAPK-8, Rn01218952_m1; PI3K class 1, Rn00579366_m1; PP2A regulatory α-isoform, Rn00588874_m1; PP2A regulatory β-isoform, Rn00710561_m1; calmodulin 1, Rn00821407_g1; p70 S6 kinase 1, Rn00583148_m1. β-Actin (Rn00667869-m1) was used as an endogenous control. Amplification was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7300 instrument using the following conditions: 2 min at 50 °C (hold), 10 min at 95 °C (hold), 15 s at 95 °C, and 1 min at 60 °C (45 cycles). The samples were amplified in triplicate and three independent isolations of RNA/cDNA were used. In each experiment non-template controls (without cDNA) did not give amplification signals. Amplification products were confirmed by sequencing. The results of qRT-PCR were in agreement with the gene array data (supplemental data Table). Statistical Analysis—At least three sets of transfection were performed for each experiment with siRNA. In experiments with cell viability a p < 0.05 was used to determine significant differences between the groups. Columns represent the mean of at least three individual experiments; bars are S.D. A paired Student's t test was used to assess significant differences between groups. Syn G Silencing Reduces both Syn G mRNA and Protein Levels—To identify a specific target sequence that is efficient for silencing the Syn G gene, we generated three siRNA to the three unique regions, i.e. to exon 3 (E3), exon 4 (E4), and 3′-UTR (Table 1). The efficiency of each siRNA in silencing the Syn G gene was first assessed by analyzing the amount of corresponding mRNA using qRT-PCR. The results obtained showed that siRNA to E4 and 3′-UTR caused only moderate reduction of Syn G mRNA compared with control (11 and 23% reduction, respectively), whereas siRNA to E3 significantly inhibited Syn G expression (82% reduction) (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B demonstrates a representative amplification plot with mRNA isolated from cells with knockdown Syn G (siRNA to E3) and scrambled control siRNA (Scr). In addition to assessing levels of the Syn G mRNA in the knockdown and control cells, the amounts of corresponding protein was compared in these cell lysates by Western blot. In good agreement with the gene expression data, Western blot results showed ∼85% reduction in the Syn G protein level in RGC-5 silenced with siRNA to E3 (Fig. 1C). Thus, in further experiments we used siRNA to E3, identified as the most effective target for siRNA-mediated silencing of the Syn G gene in RGC-5 stable clones. Effect of Syn G Silencing on Cell Viability—To determine whether down-regulation of Syn G affects cell viability we have subjected both RGC-5 cultures with Syn G knockdown and control cells to four cytotoxic compounds, i.e. etoposide, staurosporine, HNE, and hydrogen peroxide. As shown on Fig. 2, the viability of cells with Syn G silencing was decreased in the presence of staurosporine (A) and HNE (B and C). The maximal effect of Syn G knockdown on cell viability relative to “scrambled” control was 33% (500 nm staurosporine, 15 h, Fig. 2A) and 23% (35 μm HNE, 6 h, Fig. 2B). In the presence of etoposide and hydrogen peroxide no statistically significant changes in cell viability were observed (not shown). Effect of Syn G Silencing on Prosurvival and Proapoptotic Proteins in Syn G-silenced Cells—We did not find any statistically significant differences in the expression level of pro-apoptotic (Bad and Bax) and found only a slight reduction in the level of pro-survival proteins (Bcl-2) in the RGC-5 cells with silenced Syn G (Fig. 3A). To further elucidate a mechanism of the reduced cell viability of the Syn G-silenced cells, we then examined the phosphorylation status of Bad protein. We selected Bad, because the phosphorylation status of this pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl2 family plays a critical role in RGC survival (31Huang W. Fileta J.B. Dobberfuhl A. Filippopolous T. Guo Y.

https://openalex.org/W2032906293,"Spatial regulation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is required for chemotaxis in fibroblasts; however, the mechanism(s) by which PKA regulates the cell migration machinery remain largely unknown. Here we report that one function of PKA during platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced chemotaxis was to promote membrane ruffling by regulating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>) dynamics. Inhibition of PKA activity dramatically altered membrane dynamics and attenuated formation of peripheral membrane ruffles in response to PDGF. PKA inhibition also significantly decreased the number and size of PIP<sub>3</sub>-rich membrane ruffles in response to uniform stimulation and to gradients of PDGF. This ruffling defect was quantified using a newly developed method, based on computer vision edge-detection algorithms. PKA inhibition caused a marked attenuation in the bulk accumulation of PIP<sub>3</sub> following PDGF stimulation, without effects on PI3-kinase (PI3K) activity. The deficits in PIP<sub>3</sub> dynamics correlated with a significant inhibition of growth factor-induced membrane recruitment of endogenous Akt and Rac activation in PKA-inhibited cells. Simultaneous inhibition of PKA and Rac had an additive inhibitory effect on growth factor-induced ruffling dynamics. Conversely, the expression of a constitutively active Rac allele was able to rescue the defect in membrane ruffling and restore the localization of a fluorescent PIP<sub>3</sub> marker to membrane ruffles in PKA-inhibited cells, even in the absence of PI3K activity. These data demonstrate that, like Rac, PKA contributes to PIP<sub>3</sub> and membrane dynamics independently of direct regulation of PI3K activity and suggest that modulation of PIP<sub>3</sub>/3-phosphatidylinositol (3-PI) lipids represents a major target for PKA in the regulation of PDGF-induced chemotactic events."
https://openalex.org/W2043388289,"The membrane type (MT) 6 matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) (MMP25) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) that is highly expressed in leukocytes and in some cancer tissues. We previously showed that natural MT6-MMP is expressed on the cell surface as a major reduction-sensitive form of Mr 120, likely representing enzyme homodimers held by disulfide bridges. Among the membrane type-MMPs, the stem region of MT6-MMP contains three cysteine residues at positions 530, 532, and 534 which may contribute to dimerization. A systematic site-directed mutagenesis study of the Cys residues in the stem region shows that Cys532 is involved in MT6-MMP dimerization by forming an intermolecular disulfide bond. The mutagenesis data also suggest that Cys530 and Cys534 form an intramolecular disulfide bond. The experimental observations on cysteines were also investigated by computational studies of the stem peptide, which validate these proposals. Dimerization is not essential for transport of MT6-MMP to the cell surface, partitioning into lipid rafts or cleavage of α-1-proteinase inhibitor. However, monomeric forms of MT6-MMP exhibited enhanced autolysis and metalloprotease-dependent degradation. Collectively, these studies establish the stem region of MT6-MMP as the dimerization interface, an event whose outcome imparts protease stability to the protein.

A systematic site-directed mutagenesis study of the Cys residues in the stem region shows that Cys532 is involved in MT6-MMP dimerization by forming an intermolecular disulfide bond. The mutagenesis data also suggest that Cys530 and Cys534 form an intramolecular disulfide bond. The experimental observations on cysteines were also investigated by computational studies of the stem peptide, which validate these proposals. Dimerization is not essential for transport of MT6-MMP to the cell surface, partitioning into lipid rafts or cleavage of α-1-proteinase inhibitor. However, monomeric forms of MT6-MMP exhibited enhanced autolysis and metalloprotease-dependent degradation. Collectively, these studies establish the stem region of MT6-MMP as the dimerization interface, an event whose outcome imparts protease stability to the protein.

Visse R. Murphy G. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 69: 562-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). The membrane-anchored MMPs, known as membrane type-MMPs (MT-MMPs) evolved to specifically target substrates at the pericellular space and in the plasma membrane by incorporating two distinct anchoring motifs, namely a transmembrane domain as in the case of MT1-(MMP14), MT2-(MMP15), MT3-(MMP16), and MT5-MMP (MMP24) or a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety as in the case of MT4-(MMP17) and MT6-MMP (MMP25) (2.Zucker S. Pei D. Cao J. Lopez-Otin C. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 2003; 54: 1-74Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of membrane-anchoring domains confers unique properties and regulatory mechanisms to this subset of MMPs, which serve to tightly control the localization and amount of protease at the cell surface. These regulatory mechanisms include targeting to cell-matrix contacts, insertion into membrane microdomains, internalization and recycling, processing, oligomerization, and ectodomain shedding (3.Osenkowski P. Toth M. Fridman R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 200: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 4.Itoh Y. Seiki M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 206: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Although there is substantial information on the regulation of transmembrane MT-MMPs by these processes, in particular with MT1-MMP (3.Osenkowski P. Toth M. Fridman R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 200: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 4.Itoh Y. Seiki M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 206: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 5.Barbolina M.V. Stack M.S. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 19: 24-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), little is known about the regulation of GPI-MT-MMPs, MT4- and MT6-MMP. Structurally, the GPI-MT-MMPs comprise the classical domain organization of MMPs including an N-terminal prodomain, a zinc-containing catalytic domain, a hinge region, and a C-terminal hemopexin-like domain (6.Pei D. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 7.Puente X.S. Pendas A.M. Llano E. Velasco G. Lopez-Otin C. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 944-949PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Sohail A. Sun Q. Zhao H. Bernardo M.M. Cho J.A. Fridman R. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2008; 27: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Like all members of the MT-MMP family, the GPI-MT-MMPs also contain a stem (stalk) region downstream of the hemopexin-like domain which is followed by the anchoring motif. However, as opposed to the transmembrane MT-MMPs, the stem region of MT6- and MT4-MMP contains three and two unique cysteine residues, respectively, which may play a role in formation of disulfide bridges (8.Sohail A. Sun Q. Zhao H. Bernardo M.M. Cho J.A. Fridman R. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2008; 27: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recent evidence from our laboratory has shown that under non-reducing conditions MT6-MMP is consistently detected as a major form of ∼120 kDa, likely representing dimeric enzyme complexes at the cell surface (9.Sun Q. Weber C.R. Sohail A. Bernardo M.M. Toth M. Zhao H. Turner J.R. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21998-22010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Upon reduction, MT6-MMP is mostly found as a 57-kDa species. Based on these data, we hypothesized that the ∼120-kDa form of MT6-MMP represents enzyme homodimers held by intermolecular disulfide bridges within the stem region (9.Sun Q. Weber C.R. Sohail A.

In this study we examined the role of the cysteine residues located within the stem region in dimerization of MT6-MMP by site-directed mutagenesis and computational and functional studies. We show that that Cys532 is essential for dimer formation. These studies establish a unique role for the stem region of MT6-MMP in mediating disulfide-linked homodimerization. Cell Culture—The human colon cancer cell line HCT-116 (CCL-247), the immortalized monkey kidney cell line COS-1 (CRL-1650), and the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 (CCL-240) were all obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). HCT-116 and COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. HL-60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin G sodium and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate). All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. HL-60 Differentiation—HL-60 cells were induced to differentiate into neutrophil-like cells by treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as described (10.Trayner I.D. Bustorff T. Etches A.E. Mufti G.J. Foss Y. Farzaneh F. Leuk. Res. 1998; 22: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 11.Wang F. Herzmark P. Weiner O.D. Srinivasan S. Servant G. Bourne H.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 513-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Briefly, HL-60 cells at a density of 1.0 × 106cells/ml were treated with 1.25% DMSO in complete culture media for 7 days. The cells were then harvested, pelleted, and processed for immunoblot analyses as described below. Differentiation into neutrophil-like cells was monitored by mRNA expression of bcl-2 and bfl-1, as previously described (12.Santos-Beneit A.M. Mollinedo F. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 712-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Antibodies—The monoclonal antibody (mAb) MAB1142 to human MT6-MMP was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). A rabbit pAb to human caveolin was from BD Biosciences. The mAb to the human transferrin receptor was purchased from BD Biosciences. The mAb to β-actin and the rabbit pAb to human α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1-PI) were purchased from Sigma. cDNA Constructs and Transfections—The full-length human MT6-MMP cDNA was cloned into the expression plasmid pcDNA™3.1/myc-His (-) A (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA3.1-MT6 for stable transfection, as described previously (9.Sun Q.

Single, double, or triple Cys → Ala substitutions at Cys530, Cys532, and Cys534 present within the stem region of MT6-MMP were generated by the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using sequence specific primers and wild type pcDNA3.1-MT6 DNA as the template. The Cys mutants were designated as depicted in Fig. 2. In addition, the single C532A mutant was further mutated by site-directed mutagenesis to substitute the catalytic Glu233 residue for alanine to generate catalytically inactive protease. The sequences of the inserts and junctions in the vectors were verified by DNA sequencing. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with wild type, mutant, or chimeric MT6-MMP cDNAs using FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) as recommended by the manufacturer. 24–48 h after transfection the cells were harvested, and the lysates were subjected to immunoblot analyses as described below. To generate stable transfectants, HCT-116 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1 vectors containing the single C532A or triple C530A/C2A/C4A MT6-MMP mutant cDNA using FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent, and Geneticin® (G418 sulfate, Invitrogen)-resistant pooled populations were selected using conventional approaches. Stable pooled populations of HCT-116 cells expressing wild type MT6-MMP cDNA (referred to as MT6-HCT cells) or transfected with pcDNA3.1 without inserts (empty vector and, thus, referred to as EV-HCT cells) were generated as previously described (9.Sun Q.

Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA of HL-60 cells treated with or without 1.25% DMSO was extracted with total RNA purification system (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription-PCR was performed with 2 μg each of total RNA sample using SuperScript™ III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and subsequently Taq® DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The sequences of the specific primers used for human MT6-MMP are as follows: forward, 5′-ATG GCC TGC AGC AAC TCT AT-3′; reverse, 5′-AGG GGC CTT TGA AGA AGA AA-3′. The sequences of human bcl-2 and bfl-1 primers are as follows: bcl-2 forward, 5′-AGA TGT CCA GCC AGC TGC ACC TGA C-3′; bcl-2 reverse, 5′-AGA TAG GCA CCC AGG GTG ATG CAA GCT-3′; bfl-1 forward, 5′-AGG CTG GCT CAG GAC TCT CTG C-3′; bfl-1 reverse, 5′-TTC TGG TCA ACA GTA TTG CTT CAG G-3′. Thirty cycles of PCR were performed with 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 52 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. The housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was also amplified and used as an internal control. The sequences of the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers are as follows: forward, 5′-CCA CCC ATG GCA AAT TCC ATG GCA-3′; reverse, 5′-TCT AGA CGG CAG GTC AGG TCC ACC-3′. The amplified genes were resolved by 1.8% agarose gels and detected by ethidium bromide staining. Preparation of Cell Lysates and Immunoblot Analyses—Cells were solubilized with cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 5 mm EDTA, and 60 mm octyl glucoside) supplemented with 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide and protease inhibitor mixture without EDTA (Complete, Mini, EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). Briefly, the cells were incubated with lysis buffer for 1 h on ice and centrifuged (13,000 rpm) for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration in the lysates was determined by the BCA procedure (Pierce). An aliquot of each lysate was mixed with Laemmli SDS-sample buffer with or without 1% β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), boiled (95 °C, 5 min), and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analyses using various antibodies. Cell Surface Biotinylation and Phosphatidylinositol-specific Phospholipase C (PI-PLC) Treatment—Cells (HCT-116 or COS-1) stably or transiently expressing wild type or mutant MT6-MMP in 6-well plates were surface-biotinylated with the cell-impermeable EZ-link-sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce), as described previously (9.Sun Q.

After a brief centrifugation (15 min, 13,000 rpm), equal protein amounts of the supernatants were incubated with Neutravidin beads (Pierce) at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed 5 times with harvest buffer (0.5% SDS, 60 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with 2.5% Triton X-100 (final concentration), and bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli SDS sample buffer, boiled, and resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. The proteins were detected with MT6-MMP antibodies as described (9.Sun Q. Weber C.R. Sohail A. Bernardo M.M. Toth M. Zhao H. Turner J.R. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21998-22010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In some experiments, 24 h after transient transfection with the appropriate cDNAs, COS-1 cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and treated with 0.3 units/well of PI-PLC (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in PBS for 30 min on ice. The supernatant was clarified and concentrated with Microcon® centrifugal filter devices (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in the presence of EDTA-free protease inhibitors mixture mix (Roche Applied Science). An aliquot of each concentrated supernatant was mixed with Laemmli SDS-sample buffer with or without β-ME, boiled and resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis. Preparation of Crude Plasma Membrane Fraction and Successive Detergent Extraction of Lipid Rafts—Crude plasma membrane fraction and detergent extraction of lipid rafts were prepared as described previously (9.Sun Q. Weber C.R. Sohail A. Bernardo M.M. Toth M. Zhao H. Turner J.R. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21998-22010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Processing of α1-Proteinase Inhibitor by MT6-MMP Mutants—Crude plasma fractions of HCT-116 cells (25 and 50 μg/reaction) expressing wild type or MT6-MMP mutants (single C532A or triple C530A/C2A/C4A) were incubated with 25 ng of purified human α1-PI (Sigma) in 50 μl of collagenase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Brij-35) supplemented with PI mixture (Roche Applied Science). After 16 h at 37 °C, the reactions were mixed with Laemmli SDS-sample buffer with 1% β-ME, boiled, and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-α1-PI pAb. The blots were reprobed with an anti-MT6-MMP MAB1142. Computational Method—Sequence analysis was carried out to probe the secondary structure of the stem peptide of 31 amino acids (PAPSSGPRAPRPPKATPVSETCDCQCELNQA). The sequence homology method by SWISS-model failed to identify a template protein from the existing crystal structures. A more fundamental residue-by-residue analysis was applied by SDSC (San Diego Supercomputer Center) Biology Workbench and Garnier et al. (14.Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3419) Google Scholar) and Chou and Fasman (15.Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 222-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar) methods, both of which predicted α-helical conformation from Thr529 to Ala539. Secondary structure prediction was more difficult for the remainder of the sequence, but at least five amino acids were predicted to be involved in turn: Ser512, Pro515, Arg519, Pro521, and Glu528. The likelihood is that this 31-amino acid stretch is highly flexible. Model building started with construction of an α-helical structure within Sybyl (Tripos, 8.0) for Thr529 to Ala539 (434 atoms). The N-terminal residue Pro509 was protonated, and the C-terminal Ala539 was deprotonated in AMBER (Version 8.0). Solvent molecules (a total of 4378 TIP3P water molecules) were added to encompass the peptide. The entire complex, including the water molecules, was energy-minimized by the methodology described before (16.Zhang W. Shi Q. Meroueh S.O. Vakulenko S.B. Mobashery S. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10113-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The 50,000-step energy minimization generated a low energy conformation (total energy change less than 0.2 kcal·mol-1). Subsequently, simulations were carried out using explicit-solvent molecular dynamics. Implicit-solvent simulation was also performed using the modified Generalized Born method (17.Onufriev A. Bashford D. Case D.A. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2000; 104: 3712-3720Crossref Scopus (872) Google Scholar), the findings of which were very similar to the explicit solvent method. MT6-MMP Is Induced in Differentiated HL-60 Cells—MT6-MMP is known to be highly expressed in neutrophils (6.Pei D. Cell Res. 1999; 9: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 18.Kang T. Yi J. Guo A. Wang X. Overall C.M. Jiang W. Elde R. Borregaard N. Pei D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21960-21968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), where it is also detected as a major ∼120-kDa form, as we previously reported (9.Sun Q. Weber C.R. Sohail A. Bernardo M.M. Toth M. Zhao H. Turner J.R. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21998-22010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To test whether human promyelocytic HL-60 cells express the ∼120-kDa MT6-MMP after differentiation into neutrophil-like cells, the cells were treated with DMSO, an agent known to induce their differentiation to the neutrophil lineage (19.Birnie, G. D. (1988) Br. J. Cancer Suppl. 9, 41–45Google Scholar, 20.Collins S.J. Ruscetti F.W. Gallagher R.E. Gallo R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunopharmacol. 2002; 2: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After treatment, the cells were collected and examined for MT6-MMP expression by reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblot analyses. Expression of bcl-2 and bfl-1 mRNA was used as a marker of differentiation into neutrophil-like cells by DMSO as reported (12.Santos-Beneit A.M. Mollinedo F. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 712-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, untreated HL-60 cells express MT6-MMP mRNA. However, MT6-MMP protein was undetectable (Fig. 1B). DMSO treatment resulted in a significant increase (2.5-fold) in MT6-MMP mRNA (Fig. 1A), which correlated with detection of MT6-MMP protein (Fig. 1B). Under non-reducing conditions, MT6-MMP was detected as ∼120-kDa form, which after reduction was converted to ∼57-kDa species (Fig. 1B). Thus, differentiation of HL-60 cells into neutrophil-like cells correlates with expression of MT6-MMP, which is found as a reduction-sensitive form of ∼120 kDa, as reported for human neutrophils (9.Sun Q. Weber C.R. Sohail A. Bernardo M.M. Toth M. Zhao H. Turner J.R. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 21998-22010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These data confirm the ∼120-kDa form as the major species of MT6-MMP in leukocytes. Cys532 in the Stem Region of MT6-MMP Is the Dimerization Site—The reduction sensitivity of the ∼120-kDa form of MT6-MMP suggested that this species may represent disulfide-linked homodimers mediated by cysteine residues within the stem region (Fig. 2A). Therefore, to map which of the three Cys residues of the stem region is involved in MT6-MMP dimerization, we performed single, double, and triple amino acid substitutions at the stem Cys residues at positions 530, 532, and 534 by site-directed mutagenesis, as depicted in Fig. 2B. The wild type and mutant MT6-MMP cDNAs were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. Cells were lysed in the presence of N-ethylmaleimide to prevent oxidation of free thiols. The total cell lysates and the surface-biotinylated proteins of the transfected cells were then resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions and examined for the presence of MT6-MMP forms. As shown in Fig. 3, all the Cys mutants could be successfully expressed, as determined by the presence of the monomeric form of MT6-MMP in the cell lysates (Fig. 3A, +β-ME) and at the cell surface, as detected under reducing conditions (Fig. 3B, +β-ME). However, under non-reducing conditions, the single C532A (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 3 and 3′) mutant exhibited a significant reduction in dimeric forms when compared with wild type MT6-MMP and the other single and double Cys mutants. The triple C530A/C2A/C4A (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 8 and 8′) mutant showed no detectable dimers at the cell surface (Fig. 3B, lane 8′). However, a minor trace of a ∼120-kDa immunoreactive form was detected in the total cell lysate of the triple C530A/C2A/C4A mutant (Fig. 3A, lane 8, -β-ME), suggesting the existence of non-covalent interactions under these conditions. To further determine if the Cys mutants were membrane-anchored and exposed to the cell surface, the cells were treated with PI-PLC 24 h after transfection. This time was purposely selected to avoid excessive turnover of the proteins and, thus, evaluate the ability of the full-length wild type and mutant MT6-MMP proteins to traffic to the cell surface and be released by PI-PLC. Fig. 4 shows that overall all the recombinant MT6-MMP proteins were released by PI-PLC, consistent with GPI-anchoring and cell surface targeting, in agreement with the results of Fig. 3. However, the dimerization-deficient C532A and C530A/C2A/C4A mutants were detected in the cell surface in a monomeric form. Altogether, these results suggest a role for Cys532 in MT6-MMP dimerization.FIGURE 4PI-PLC release of MT6-MMP Cys mutants. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected to express with type (WT) MT6-MMP (lanes 1 and 1′) or Cys MT6-MMP mutants (lanes 2–5 and 2′–5′). Twenty-four hours later the cells were treated with 0.5 ml of PI-PLC (0.3 units/well) in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min on ice. The supernatant was concentrated and mixed with Laemmli SDS-sample buffer with (+) or without (-) β-ME and resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis with mAb MAB1142. MT6D, MT6-MMP dimeric form; MT6M, MT6-MMP monomeric form.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although substitution of Cys532 inhibited dimerization (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 3 and 3′), we found that all the double Cys mutants generated dimers (Fig. 3B, lanes 5′, 6′, and 7′) albeit at lower levels than wild type MT6-MMP (Fig. 3B, lane 1′) and the single C530A (Fig. 3B, lane 2′) and C534A (Fig. 3B, lane 4′) mutants. This result suggests that the double Cys mutants are capable of undergoing partial dimerization, likely via any of the remaining Cys residue. This is also supported by the low levels of the monomeric form detected under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 5–7 and 5′-7′). The observations that only substitution of Cys532 was sufficient to abrogate dimerization and that the double mutants (even those with mutated Cys532) could undergo partial dimerization suggested that in wild type MT6-MMP, Cys532 forms an intermolecular disulfide bond, whereas Cys530 and Cys534 form an intramolecular disulfide bond within the stem region. Analyses of MT6-MMP Stem Peptide by Computational Dynamics—The mutagenesis data (Fig. 3) suggested a model of the MT6-MMP stem region in which Cys530 and Cys534 form intramolecular disulfide bonds, whereas Cys532 mediates homodimerization. Although the existence of disulfide bonds can be determined by mass spectrometry, this approach is a challenging task with MT6-MMP due the close proximity of the cysteine residues in the stem region (22.Gorman J.J. Wallis T.P. Pitt J.J. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 2002; 21: 183-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Therefore, to gain further insight into the structural issues of cysteine residues within the stem region of MT6-MMP, we carried out computational dynamics simulations of the 31-amino acid stem peptide. Specifically, we looked at the propensity of the cysteine thiols to approach each other in the course of molecular dynamics, a prerequisite to oxidative disulfide bond formation. The simulations generated a 3.6-ns molecular dynamics trajectory which consists of 7200 conformational states. Distances between each two Sγ atoms are defined as d1 (Cys530 and Cys532), d2 (Cys530 and Cys534), and d3 Cys532 and Cys534) (Fig. 5A). Each was extracted with the ptraj program in AMBER. Fig. 5, B–D, shows that at the start of the simulations the geometry of the energy-minimized structure was defined by d1 = 9.6 Å, d3 = 9.2 Å, and d2 = 6.7 Å. In less than 0.1 ns, d1 held at ∼10 Å, d2 reached a minimum of 3.8 Å, and d3 approached 7 Å. After 0.5 ns, d2 was ∼3 Å, whereas d1 and d3 were about 9 Å. The closest approach for d2 occurred from 570 to 890 ps, which was 3.19 Å. This closest approach was appropriate for the ultimate disulfide bond formation with a length of the covalent S-S bond of 2.03 Å. The essence of this observation is that on the closest approach, the two thiols would be predisposed to experience oxidation and to experience the formation of the disulfide bond, which will tether Cys530 and Cys534 together. From the conformation data sampled in the simulations, six distinct conformations were extracted from the trajectory, which corresponded to the six smallest separations between the Cys530-Cys534 sulfur atoms. Coordinate transformation and superimposition were made in Sybyl. The shared conformational feature in all was the helicity for the segment Glu528 to Ala539. This conformational state predisposed the two proximal cysteine side chains to the formation of the disulfide bond between Cys530 and Cys534. Fig. 6A shows this arrangement graphically, after the formation of the disulfide bond within the stem region of MT6-MMP. On formation of the intramolecular disulfide bond within the stem region, Cys532 was now available for partnering with the stem region of another MT6-MMP molecule (Fig. 6B). Based on these data, we propose a model of MT6-MMP in which the homodimer is held by disulfide bonds mediated by Cys532, whereas Cys530 and Cys534 form an intramolecular disulfide bond, as depicted in the schematic of Fig. 6C. Degradation of MT6-MMP Dimerization Mutants—The data of Fig. 3 indicated that mutations at the Cys residues of the stem region were also associated with enhanced degradation of the mutants to immunoreactive and surface-biotinylated fragments of ∼30–32 and ∼38 kDa (Fig. 3, A and B, +β-ME). However, the dimerization-deficient mutants C532A (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 3 and 3′, and Fig. 7, lane 2) and C530A/C2A/C4A (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 8 and 8′) yielded the highest levels of degradation fragments, consistent with a role for dimerization in MT6-MMP stability. Interestingly, mutations that abolish the intramolecular disulfide bond between Cys530 and Cys534 only slightly increased the amounts of degradation products (Fig. 3A and B, lanes 2, 2′, 4, and 4′). This suggests that the intramolecular Cys530-Cys534 disulfide bond (Figs. 6C) is not essential for MT6-MMP stability. Although the degradation products were detected at the cell surface by biotinylation (Fig. 3B), the PI-PLC-mediated released fraction (shown in Fig. 4, right panel) contained mostly the full-length enzymes. This discrepancy may be explained by the time elapsed after transfection for analyses (24 h for the PI-PLC treatment, as stated earlier, versus 40 h for surface biotinylation), which may affect the extent of degradation. Alternatively, the full-length enzyme and the degradation products may exhibit a differential sensitivity to PI-PLC cleavage due to changes in conformation or accessibility. Interestingly,"

Here, we investigated at an atomic level the mechanism of inverse agonism and partial agonism of two high affinity, high selectivity very similar non-peptide ligands of the cholecystokinin-2 receptor (CCK2R) which differ by the absence or presence of a methyl group on their indole moiety. Using in silico, site-directed mutagenesis and pharmacological experiments, we demonstrated that these functionally different activities are due to differing anchoring modes of the two compounds to a residue of helix II (Thr-2.61) in the inactive state of the CCK2R. The binding mode of the inverse agonist allows the ligand to interact through its phenyl moiety with a key amino acid for CCK2R activation (Trp-6.48), preventing rotation of helix VI and, thus, CCK2R activation, whereas the partial agonist binds deeper into the binding pocket and closer to helix V, so that CCK2R activation is favored. This study on the molecular mechanism of ligand action opens the possibility of target-based optimization of G protein-coupled receptor non-peptide ligands.

G protein-coupled receptor CCK2 receptor targeted molecular dynamics inositol phosphates molecular dynamics Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium wild type GPCRs naturally exist in different conformations which correspond to both active and inactive states.

To date, three three-dimensional GPCR structures have been precisely determined by x-ray crystallography, namely that of rhodopsin and β2- and β1-adrenergic receptors (3Palczewski K. Kumasaka T.

In this context, refinement of modeled GPCR structures in both active and inactive conformations and progress in the understanding of the precise mechanisms, which govern their activation, are of paramount importance for drug design strategies (7Becker O.M.

The cholecystokinin-2 (CCK-2) receptor (CCK2R) belongs to family A of rhodopsin-like GPCRs. It binds both cholecystokinin and gastrin with a similar, high affinity (8Kopin A.S. Lee Y.M. McBride E.W.

CCK2R mediates a wide spectrum of CCK- and gastrin-induced biological effects in the central nervous system and in periphery including anxiety, pain perception, and gastric acid secretion as well as controlling growth and differentiation of the gastric mucosa. The CCK2R and/or a constitutively active variant of this receptor may contribute to human diseases (10Noble F. Wank S.A. Crawley J.N. Bradwejn J. Seroogy K.B. Hamon M. Roques B.P. Pharmacol.

This has recently generated considerable interest in the identification, among the large panel of synthetic ligands, of CCK2R antagonists having an inverse agonist activity (12Herranz R. Med. Res. Rev. 2003; 23: 559-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 13Foucaud M. Tikhonova I.G. Langer I. Escrieut C. Dufresne M. Seva C. Maigret B. Fourmy D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 680-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The CCK2R appears to be an excellent G protein-coupled receptor prototype on which a strategy of rational design of ligand can be tested. With this in mind, we have recently constructed and experimentally validated models of the active and the inactive CCK2R and delineated activation mechanism of this receptor (14Marco E. Foucaud M. Langer I. Escrieut C. Tikhonova I.G. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28779-28790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the present work we wanted to answer the important question previously raised in the course of CCK2R antagonist design, why two high affinity high selectivity very similar non-peptide ligands of the CCK2R display differential pharmacological activity, namely antagonism and partial agonism at the CCK2R (15Kalindjian S.B. Dunstone D.J. Low C.M. Pether M.J. Roberts S.P. Tozer M.J. Watt G.F. Shankley N.P. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 1125-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The two ligands have the same chemical core, but they differ by the absence (JB93,182) or presence (JB93,242) of a methyl group on the indole nitrogen (Fig. 1). We have used laboratory experiments to demonstrate that JB93,182 is a partial inverse agonist and JB93,242 is a partial agonist at human CCK2R and a combination of in silico and site-directed mutagenesis studies to show that these opposing activities are due to different anchoring modes of the two compounds to a residue of helix II (Thr-2.61) 4Amino acid numbering according to standardized Ballesteros-Weinstein numbering www.gpcr.org/7tm. Amino acid abbreviation is followed by two numbers: the first number corresponds to transmembrane helix of the receptor; the second number corresponds to amino acid position in the helix relative to the most-conserved amino acid to which the arbitrary number 50 was given. in the inactive state of the CCK2R. The binding mode of the inverse agonist allows the molecule to interact with a key amino acid for CCK2R activation (Trp-6.48), preventing its rotation, whereas the partial agonist bound deeper in the binding pocket, close to helix V, allowing rotation of helix VI. Such an understanding the molecular mechanism of ligand action opens the possibility of target-based optimization of GPCR non-peptide ligands. Building, Refinement, and Molecular Dynamics of CCK2R-Ligand Complexes—The previous model of CCK2R* (14Marco E. Foucaud M. Langer I. Escrieut C. Tikhonova I.G. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28779-28790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was used as starting point to dock JB93,242 and JB93,182. The starting three-dimensional conformation of the ligands was obtained using Corina software (27Sadowski J. Schwab C. Gasteiger J. Corina 3.1. Molecular Networks GmbH Computerchemie, Erlangen, Germany2008Google Scholar). Electrostatic potential-derived charges were obtained with the restrained electric potential methodology (16Bayly C.I.

The Lamarckian genetic algorithm77 implemented in Auto-Dock 3.0 was used to generate docked conformations of JB93,242 and JB93,182 in a putative pocket within the transmembrane helices of CCK2R by randomly changing the overall orientation of the molecules as well as torsion angles. Default settings were used, except for the number of runs, population size, and maximum number of energy evaluations, which were fixed at 100, 100, and 250,000, respectively. Rapid intra- and intermolecular energy evaluation of each configuration was achieved by having the receptor atomic affinity potentials for carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms precalculated in a three-dimensional grid with a spacing of 0.375 Å. The selected docking solutions were refined by means of molecular dynamics simulations in an explicit lipid bilayer. The receptor structure was neutralized by the addition of 15 chloride ions and placed in a rectangular box (∼78 × 80 × 78 in size) containing a lipid bilayer (153 molecules of palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine and 8708 molecules of water in addition to the receptor structure), resulting in a final density of 1.0 g/cm3. Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations at 300 K and constant pressure (1 atm) with anisotropic scaling were then run for 1ns using the SANDER module in AMBER 8. The conditions of the MDs and the simulation protocol were the same as previously described (14Marco E. Foucaud M. Langer I. Escrieut C. Tikhonova I.G. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28779-28790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For ligand docking to the inactive CCK2R°, modeled CCK2R° was superimposed on the CCK2R*·JB93,242 complex, providing an initial position of JB93,242 in CCK2R°. Docking of JB93,182 to CCK2R° was performed on this basis. The initial steric clashes were eliminated by means of 1000 steps of steepest descent energy minimization followed by 2000 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization of all the system with the exception of Cα carbons of helices I, II, and III that were harmonically restrained to their initial positions. The resulting complexes were then studied by MDs in an explicit lipid bilayer under the same conditions as those described above. Targeted Molecular Dynamics Simulations—This technique has been used to explore in silico CCK2R° to CCK2R* conversion using as initial and target structures a representative snap-shot of the inactive and active CCK2R, respectively. The targeted molecular dynamics (TMD) approach used the standard implementation recently incorporated into AMBER (Version 8.0) which allows the solvent molecules to move freely and follow the dynamics of the protein. A restraint was defined in terms of a mass-weighted root mean square superposition to the final reference structure (target, CCK2R*) and applied in the force field as an extra harmonic potential energy term of the form E = 0.5 × kr × N (r.m.s.d.-t.r.m.s.d.),2 where E is the biasing potential energy in kcal/mol during the TMD simulation, kr is the force constant, N is the number of atoms, r.m.s.d. is the root mean square deviation from the target structure, and t.r.m.s.d. is the desired r.m.s.d. value. The initial value of the desired root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) value (t.r.m.s.d.) was set as the r.m.s.d. between the initial and target structures (CCK2R° and CCK2R*, respectively), and during the simulation, t.r.s.m.d. was gradually decreased to zero. Only the heavy atoms of the protein were considered in the root mean square definition. A force constant of 0.25 kcal/mol × Å over 0.5 ns appeared sufficient to find a low energy path leading from the simulated structure to the target structure. Site-directed Mutagenesis of CCK2R and Transfection of COS-7 Cells—All mutant receptor cDNAs were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit, Stratagene, France) using human CCK2R cDNAs cloned in the pRFNeo vector as template. The presence of desired and the absence of undesired mutations were confirmed by automated sequencing of the complete CCK2R coding sequence (Applied Biosystem). COS-7 cells (1.5 × 106) were plated onto 10-cm culture dishes and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 5! fetal calf serum in a 5! CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. After overnight incubation, cells were transfected with 1 μg/plate (excepted when mentioned) of pRFNeo vectors containing the cDNA for the wild-type or mutated CCK2 receptors using a modified DEAE-dextran method. Cells were transferred to 24-well plates 24 h after transfection at a density of 150,000 cells/well for inositol phosphate determination and 5-10,000 cells/well for binding assays. Inositol Phosphate Production Determination—Approximately 24 h after transfer to 24-well plates and after overnight incubation in DMEM containing 2 μCi/ml of myo-[2-3H]inositol (specific activity, 10-25 Ci/ml, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), transfected cells were washed with DMEM and incubated for 30 min in 1 ml/well DMEM containing 20 mm LiCl at 37 °C. Cells were washed with inositol phosphates (Ins-P) buffer at pH 7.45: phosphate-buffered saline containing 135 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA,10 mm LiCl, 11.1 mm glucose, and 0.5! bovine serum albumin. Cells were then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in 0.3-ml Ins-P buffer alone or with ligands. Reactions were stopped by adding 1 ml of methanol/HCl to each well, and contents were transferred to a column (Dowex AG 1-X8, formate form, Bio-Rad) for the determination of Ins-P. Columns were washed twice with 3 ml of distilled water and twice with 2 ml of 5 mm sodium tetraborate, 60 mm sodium formate. The content of each column was eluted by the addition of 2 ml of 1 m ammonium formate, 100 mm formic acid. Radioactivity of 1 ml of the eluted fraction was evaluated using a liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co., Downers Grove, IL). Values for Ins-P accumulation were normalized to a constant number of expressed receptors at the cell surface (1 pmol) as determined in binding assays and were expressed as -fold number of the basal value achieved with the wild-type CCK2R. Mock cells were transfected with a pRFNeo non-coding vector. Efficacy was regarded as Ins-P production in the presence of a supramaximal concentration (1 μm) of a compound, whereas potency corresponded to concentration of that compound producing 50! of the maximal Ins-P production. Receptor Binding Assay—Approximately 24 h after transfer of transfected cells to 24-well plates, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.1! bovine serum albumin and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in 0.3 ml DMEM containing 0.1! bovine serum albumin with an appropriate concentration of high performance liquid chromatography-purified 125I-labeled BH-(Thr,Nle)-CCK9 (specific activity, 1600-2000 Ci/mmol.) in the presence or the absence of unlabeled CCK. Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 2! bovine serum albumin, and cell-associated radioligand was collected by cell lysis with 0.1 n NaOH. The radioactivity was directly counted in a gamma counter (Auto-Gamma, Packard). Receptor density (Bmax) and Kd were calculated from homologous 125I-labeled BH-(Thr,Nle)-CCK9 competition binding experiments using Ligand software (Kell, Cambridge, UK). Ki for competitors were calculated using the non-linear curve fitting software GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA). Pharmacological Properties of JB93,182 and JB93,242—The effects of JB93,182 and 93,242 on CCK-stimulated production of Ins-P in COS-7 cells expressing the CCK2R were first analyzed. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, dose-response curves differed according to the concentration of CCK used to stimulate the cells. Indeed, JB93,182 inhibited accumulation of Ins-P after stimulation by 0.18, 0.5, and 10 nm CCK with IC50, which were 35.1 ± 10.8, 70.3 ± 14.1, and 943 ± 110 nm, respectively, whereas JB93,242 enhanced (155!) production of Ins-P observed in the presence of 0.18 nm CCK but partially inhibited Ins-P production after stimulation by 0.5 or 10 nm (inhibitory effects, 18 and 60!, respectively). Furthermore, when added alone to cells expressing the wild-type CCK2R, the two non-peptide ligands displayed opposite effects on CCK2R-related basal Ins-P production (Fig. 2B). JB93,182 acted as a partial inverse agonist that dose-dependently inhibited basal Ins-P production (IC50 2.8 ± 0.7 nm) to a maximum of 50! of the initial value (p < 0.001), whereas JB93,242 acted as a partial agonist stimulating Ins-P production (EC50: 1.8 ± 0.2 nm) to a maximum representing 50! of the maximum achieved with 1 μm CCK (p < 0.001). Such a partial agonist activity of JB93,242 likely explains why this compound did not inhibit production of Ins-P in response to low concentrations of CCK, whereas it clearly decreased Ins-P production in response to 10 nm CCK (Fig. 2A, right panel). Interestingly, JB93,182 inhibited JB93,242-stimulated Ins-P production (IC50 14.6 ± 2.1 nm), confirming that the two molecules exert their effects through the CCK2R (Fig. 2C). Competition binding experiments with radioiodinated CCK indicated that the two non-peptide ligands bound with a similar high affinity to the human wild-type CCK2R (Fig. 2D). Inhibition constants were: JB93,182, Ki = 2.6 ± 0.1 nm; JB93,242, Ki = 2.4 ± 0.2 nm); the Hill number was close to the unity in both cases (not shown). Agonist activity of JB93,242 was detected and was significant in COS-7 cells transfected with amounts of plasmid as low as 0.1 μg/plate, whereas inverse agonism of JB93,182 required transfection of 1.0 μg of plasmid/plate, resulting in CCK2R expression levels ranging from 5 to 7 pmol/106 cells and basal values for Ins-P productions that were related to these CCK2R expression levels (13Foucaud M. Tikhonova I.G. Langer I. Escrieut C. Dufresne M. Seva C. Maigret B. Fourmy D. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 69: 680-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2E). Inverse agonist activity of JB93,182 seen on wild-type CCK2R was confirmed by its inhibitory effect on constitutively active E3.49A mutant previously shown as oncogenic (17Gales C. Sanchez D. Poirot M. Pyronnet S. Buscail L. Cussac D. Pradayrol L. Fourmy D. Silvente-Poirot S. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6081-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and on the robust constitutively active L5.43A mutant recently identified (14Marco E. Foucaud M. Langer I. Escrieut C. Tikhonova I.G. Fourmy D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 28779-28790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2F). Conversely, JB93,242 acted as a partial agonist on the two mutated CCK2R. All the effects observed at maximal concentrations of non-peptide ligands were dose-dependent (not illustrated). In Silico Docking of JB93,242 and JB 93,182 to the Modeled CCK2R*—To identify binding site of the two compounds, in a first step automated docking of JB93,242 to a modeled CCK2R* was performed. The docking program provided 7 clusters for JB93,242, the most populated one ranking first in the score list (36 occurrences and -17.09 kcal·mol-1). This orientation was selected as representative of the mode of binding based on the following considerations; overlapping with the bioactive part of CCK, namely the C-terminal tetrapeptide (Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-amide), and mimicking some of the structural determinants important for binding and activity of CCK (18Silvente-Poirot S.

As shown in Fig. 3, in the selected solution the indole moiety overlapped the tryptophan of CCK, the phenylalanine ring partially overlapped the methionine and phenylalanine of CCK, and the dicarboxyphenyl overlapped Asp of CCK in a manner so that one of the carboxylate groups faced the guanidinium group of Arg-6.58. Automated docking of JB93,182 in CCK2R* provided 7 clusters. Among them, the second in the score and the most populated (64 occurrences and -15.77 kcal·mol-1) corresponded to that obtained with JB93,242. Comparison of the Refined CCK2R-Ligand Complexes Obtained from Molecular Dynamics Simulations—We anticipated that the way the two ligands precisely interact with the CCK2R° or the CCK2R* may provide explanation of their distinct activities. For this purpose, all complexes obtained from automated docking were submitted to 1 ns of molecular dynamics simulation in presence of lipids. By doing so, the overall architecture of the CCK2R was preserved for the whole length of simulation for all the complexes (not illustrated). Analysis of the CCK2R°·JB93,182 and CCK2R°·JB93,242 complexes revealed that the final location of JB93,182 and JB93,242 in the binding pocket and interacting residues was different at the end of the simulation period (Figs. 4 and 5). In the CCK2R°·JB93,182 complex, the ligand was maintained in its initial docking location, and the indole group of JB93,182 was located in an area formed by Tyr-1.39, Thr-2.61, and Tyr-7.43. It established π-π interactions with Tyr-7.43, hydrophobic interactions with the methyl group of Thr-2.61, and it donated a hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl oxygen of Tyr-1.39 or to the hydroxyl oxygen of Thr-2.61. The dicarboxyphenyl ring was situated close to the second extracellular loop and to the extracellular ends of helices III, IV, and VI, and the two carboxylate groups interacted with Arg-6.58 and Tyr-4.60. Finally, the phenyl ring of JB93,182 was located in another sub-pocket constituted by residues from helices III, VI, and VII and established van der Waals contacts with Met-3.32 and Val-3.36, Trp-6.48, Val-6.51, and Tyr-6.52, and His-7.39. Importantly, Trp-6.48, a crucial residue for CCK2R° to CCK2R* conversion displayed a clear stacking interaction with the phenyl ring of JB93,182.FIGURE 5Schematic representation of the proposed binding sites for the non-peptide ligands in the CCK2R°.

At its final location the indole moiety of JB93,242 established aromatic interactions with Tyr-7.43 and His-7.39, and the methyl of the ligand interacted with Thr-2.61 methyl. As a consequence of ligand displacement, the distance between the indole moiety of JB93,242 and helix II of the CCK2R° was different from that observed in the simulated CCK2R°·JB93,182 complex (distance between the indole nitrogen of the ligand and the Cα carbon of Thr-2.61 = 6.93 Å in complex with JB93,242 versus 5.25 Å in the complex with JB93,182). Additionally, the phenylalanine ring of JB93,242 was located in a region closer to residues Met-4.57, Tyr-4.60, Leu-5.46, and Leu-5.42 (Figs. 6 and 7).FIGURE 7Superposition of CCK2R°·JB93,182 and CCK2R°·JB93,242 complexes. For simplicity, only the carbon traces of CCK2R are shown. Ligands are represented as sticks enveloped by a semi-transparent surface model. Thr-2.61 and Leu-5.42 have been labeled, and their side chains are shown as sticks to show the respective positions of the two non-peptide ligands relative to these helices.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Therefore, after molecular dynamics simulation, JB93,182 and JB93,242 occupied slightly different binding sites within the binding cavity of the CCK2R° (Fig. 7). This was due to different anchoring modes of the two ligands to Thr-2.61. Interactions bond between Thr-2.61 and JB93,182 maintained the ligand in a position so that its phenyl ring was in a clear stacking interaction with Trp-6.48 of the CCK2R°. This likely contributed to the stabilization of this key residue within the binding pocket and, as a consequence, prevented the rotation of helix VI which is required for CCK2R° to CCK2R* conversion. Conversely, in the presence of JB93,242, which did not display interaction with Trp-6.48, CCK2R activation could occur. The position occupied by JB93,242 in the CCK2R* after molecular dynamics simulations was similar to that in the CCK2R° (Fig. 6). The binding site of JB93,242 in the CCK2R* was located between helices II, III, IV, V, and VI. The pocket was formed by Val-3.36, Met-4.57, Tyr-4.60, Leu-5.46, Val-6.51, and Tyr-6.52 interacting with the phenyl ring of the ligand. Tyr-4.60 established aromatic interactions with one side of the ligand dicarboxyphenyl ring, whereas the other side faced to Arg-6.58. This latter residue also paired through hydrogen bonding interactions with the indole carbonyl. The two carboxylate groups were involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with Arg-215 and Lys-128. Finally the indole group of the ligand was located in the same hydrophobic/aromatic area formed by Thr-2.61, Met-3.32, His-7.39, and Tyr-7.43. It is worthy of note that although the phenyl ring of the non-peptide ligand was sited in the same cavity as that of CCK-Phe, they did not totally overlap, the Phe of CCK being more deeply inserted than the phenyl ring of JB93,242. An attempt to dock the inverse agonist JB93,182 in the CCK2R* resulted in an identical ligand location (not shown). Experimental Validation of JB93,182 and JB93,242 Binding Sites—To verify in silico docking of the two non-peptide ligands into the CCK2R, competition binding experiments were carried out with CCK2R mutants. Interactions suggested in silico between non-peptide ligands and residues Thr-2.61, Val-3.36, Met-4.57, Tyr-4.60, Trp-6.48, Arg-6.58, and Tyr-7.43 of the CCK2R were confirmed by the effects caused by the mutation of these amino acids on the affinity of the ligands (Table 1). T2.61A mutation decreased by 10.1- and 14.1-fold the affinity of JB93,182 and JB93,242, respectively, whereas the T2.61S mutation caused 6.3- and 9.9-fold decreases. The Y4.60A mutation reduced by 12.6-fold the affini"

It has been recently shown that ribosomes from Thermus thermophilus contain a heptameric complex L10·(L12)2·(L12)2·(L12)2, rather than the conventional pentameric complex L10·(L12)2·(L12)2. Here we describe the reconstitution of the heptameric complex from purified L10 and L12 and the characterization of its role in elongation factor G-dependent GTPase activity using a hybrid system with Escherichia coli ribosomes. The T. thermophilus heptameric complex resulted in a 2.5-fold higher activity than the E. coli pentameric complex. The structural element of the T. thermophilus complex responsible for the higher activity was investigated using a chimeric L10 protein (Ec-Tt-L10), in which the C-terminal L12-binding site in E. coli L10 was replaced with the same region from T. thermophilus, and two chimeric L12 proteins: Ec-Tt-L12, in which the E. coli N-terminal domain was fused with the T. thermophilus C-terminal domain, and Tt·Ec-L12, in which the T. thermophilus N-terminal domain was fused with the E. coli C-terminal domain. High GTPase turnover was observed with the pentameric chimeric complex formed from E. coli L10 and Ec-Tt-L12 but not with the heptameric complex formed from Ec-Tt-L10 and Tt·Ec-L12. This suggested that the C-terminal region of T. thermophilus L12, rather than the heptameric nature of the complex, was responsible for the high GTPase turnover. Further analyses with other chimeric L12 proteins identified helix α6 as the region most likely to contain the responsible element.

An earlier study of Escherichia coli L12 by x-ray crystallography revealed the structure of the CTD to be comprised of three α helices (α4, α5, and α6) and a central three-stranded β sheet (10Leijonmarck M. Liljas A. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 555-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This structure was confirmed by a recent crystallographic study of L12 from Thermotoga maritima (30Wahl M.C. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 174-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and also by NMR analyses of E. coli L12 (16Bocharov E.V. Gudkov A.T. Arseniev A.S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). More recently, the crystal structure of the complex between the N-terminal domain (helices α1 and α2) of L12 and L10 from T. maritima was elucidated using a reconstituted sample (6Diaconu M. Kothe U.

In this complex, helices α1 and α2 of the L12 N-terminal domain participate in binding to the long C-terminal helix α8 of L10, as well as in the formation of the homodimer. Three L12 dimers bind in the same manner, side by side, to the C-terminal helix of L10 (6Diaconu M. Kothe U. Schlu¨nzen F. Fischer N. Harms J.M. Tonevitsky A.G. Stark H. Rodnina M.V. Wahl M.C.

The hinge region (α3) of each L12 monomer seems to adopt a random coil structure, which is supported by the NMR data (20Gudkov A.T. Gongadze G.M. Bushuev V.N. Okon M.S. FEBS Lett. 1982; 138: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Cowgill C.A. Nichols B.G. Kenny J.W. Butler P. Bradbury E.M. Traut R.R. J. Biol.

Although it has long been known that the CTD of L12 participates in EF-G-dependent GTP hydrolysis (6Diaconu M. Kothe U. Schlu¨nzen F. Fischer N. Harms J.M. Tonevitsky A.G. Stark H. Rodnina M.V. Wahl M.C. Cell. 2005; 121: 991-1004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar, 7Gudkov A.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), the detailed mechanism of the GTPase activation is not fully understood. Recent cryo-electron microscopy data showed that the L12 CTD directly interacts with the G′ domain of EF-G (13Datta P.P. Sharma M.R. Qi L. Frank J. Agrawal R.K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 723-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic studies suggested that helices α4 and α5 in the L12 CTD are involved in the binding of EF-Tu (11Kothe U. Wieden H.J. Mohr D. Rodnina M.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 1011-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and that α4 also participates in the binding of EF-G (12Savelsbergh A. Mohr D. Kothe U. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4316-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and in the release of inorganic phosphate from the post-GTPase state of the ribosome rather than in the GTPase catalysis (12Savelsbergh A. Mohr D. Kothe U. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4316-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Direct binding of the translation factors to parts of α4 and α5 in the L12 CTD was also confirmed by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy (14Helgstrand M. Mandava C.S. Mulder F.A. Liljas A. Sanyal S. Akke M. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 468-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there is sufficient NMR evidence to show that the hinge region and the entire CTD are highly mobile within the ribosome (23Mulder F.A. Bouakaz L. Lundell A. Venkataramana M. Liljas A. Akke M. Sanyal S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5930-5936Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Christodoulou J. Larsson G. Fucini P. Connell S.R. Pertinhez T.A. Hanson C.L. Redfield C. Nierhaus K.H. Robinson C.V. Schleucher J. Dobson C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10949-10954Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cross-linking and immuno-electron microscopy data also provide evidence that the CTD interacts with various regions of the ribosome (31Olson H.M. Sommer A. Tewari D.S. Traut R.R. Glitz D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6924-6932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Makarov E.M. Oleinikov A.V. Zecherle G.N. Traut R.R. Biochimie (Paris). 1993; 75: 963-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). These lines of evidence lead to a hypothesis that the movement of the L12 CTD in the ribosome increases the frequency of contact between the CTD and the translation factors, and thus, the presence of multiple copies of L12 in the ribosome might amplify the efficiency of this process. If this hypothesis is correct, ribosomes that contain three L12 dimers, which have been detected in some thermophilic bacteria and archaea, should be able to recruit the translation factors more effectively than ribosomes that contain two L12 dimers. It has been reported that the T. thermophilus ribosome contains six copies of the L12 protein. We have recently established conditions that allow the reconstitution of the T. thermophilus stalk complex and the assay of its structure/function (33Nomura T. Nakatsuchi M. Sugita D. Nomura M. Kaminishi T. Takemoto C. Shirouzu M. Miyoshi T. Yokoyama S. Hachimori A. Uchiumi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2008; 144: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We confirmed that the T. thermophilus L12 forms a heptameric complex with L10 L10·(L12)2·(L12)2·(L12)2 and showed that the T. thermophilus stalk complexes, even a variant complex that contains only single L12 dimer, induce higher levels of EF-G-dependent GTPase activity, but not higher EF-Tu-dependent GTPase or polyphenylalanine synthesis, than the E. coli pentameric complex L10·(L12)2·(L12)2. Given that L12 makes a greater contribution to the activation of the EF-G GTPase than that of EF-Tu (5Mohr D. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12520-12528Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 34Savelsbergh A. Mohr D. Wilden B. Wintermeyer W. Rodnina M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 890-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), it is likely that Tt-L12 specifically stimulates the EF-G-dependent event. To determine the structural features of the T. thermophilus stalk complex that are responsible for the higher EF-G-dependent GTPase activity, we here constructed chimeric L10 and L12 proteins from the T. thermophilus and E. coli orthologs and reconstituted different chimeric stalk complexes that included: 1) an E. coli pentameric complex that contained L12 in which the CTD had been exchanged for that of T. thermophilus and 2) a heptameric complex that was composed of E. coli L10 whose C-terminal α8 region had been replaced with that of T. thermophilus and E. coli L12 whose N-terminal α1 and α2 regions had also been replaced with those of T. thermophilus (see Fig. 2, A and C). The results of functional assays demonstrated that the CTD of T. thermophilus L12, rather than the heptameric structure, was required for the high GTPase activity. Further analyses using other chimeric complexes suggested that helix α6 within the CTD was involved in the high GTPase turnover activity. Plasmid Construction—The coding regions for E. coli ribosomal proteins L10, L11, and L12 (designated hereafter as Ec-L10, Ec-L11, and Ec-L12, respectively) and for T. thermophilus L11 (Tt-L11) were inserted into the E. coli expression vector pET3a (Novagen) and cloned, as described previously (35Nomura T. Mochizuki R. Dabbs E.R. Shimizu Y. Ueda T. Hachimori A. Uchiumi T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4691-4698Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The coding sequences for T. thermophilus ribosomal proteins L10 (Tt-L10) and L12 (Tt-L12) were inserted into the expression vectors pGEX6p-1 (GE Healthcare) and pET11c (Novagen), respectively. A chimeric L10 protein (Ec-Tt-L10), which was composed of residues 1–132 of Ec-L10 fused with residues 132–172 of Tt-L10 (see Fig. 2A), was constructed using PCR (36Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13517) Google Scholar) and cloned into pET28c (Novagen). Chimeric L12 proteins were also prepared: Tt·Ec-L12, which comprises residues 1–36 of Tt-L12 fused with residues 37–120 of Ec-L12, and Ec-Tt-L12, which comprises residues 1–36 of E. coli L12 fused with residues 37–124 of Tt-L12 (see Fig. 2A), were cloned into pET28c and pET3a, respectively. The other chimeric L12 proteins that were constructed in this study were Ec-α3Tt-L12, Ec-α4Tt-L12, Ec-α5Tt-L12, and Ec-α6Tt-L12, which comprise Ec-L12 in which residues 37–50 (from α3), residues 63–77 (from α4), residues 80–94 (from α5), and residues 100–113 (from α6), respectively, were replaced with the equivalent regions from Tt-L12 (see Fig. 5). These chimeric L12 proteins were cloned into pET3a. Protein Expression and Purification—Proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen) by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The cells were lysed by grinding with alumina and then resuspended in buffer A, which contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NH4Cl, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (17Griaznova O. Traut R.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4075-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). All of the proteins, except Ec-Tt-L10 and Tt-L10, were obtained in the soluble (S100) fraction. The S100 fractions that contained the proteins were dialyzed against buffer B, which contained 20 mm NaOAc (pH 4.5), 7 m urea, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and then applied to a column of CM-cellulose (Whatman) that had been equilibrated with the same buffer. Ec-L12, Ec-Tt-L12, Tt·Ec-L12, Ec-α3Tt-L12, Ec-α4Tt-L12, Ec-α5Tt-L12, and Ec-α6Tt-L12 were all eluted in the flow-through fraction, whereas Ec-L10, Ec-L11, and Tt-L11 were eluted in a stepwise manner using buffer B containing 0.04–0.12 m LiCl. Individual proteins that had been eluted in the flow-through fraction were dialyzed against buffer C, which consisted of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 m urea, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and then purified using an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system with a Resource Q column (GE Healthcare) and a linear gradient of 0–200 mm LiCl in buffer C. The fractions that contained Ec-L10, Ec-L11, and Tt-L11 were individually dialyzed against buffer D, which consisted of 20 mm NaOAc (pH 5.0), 6 m urea, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and purified using an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system with a Resource S column (GE Healthcare) and a linear gradient of 0–200 mm LiCl in buffer D. The S100 fraction that contained Tt-L12 was heated to 70 °C for 10 min to remove the E. coli proteins, and the Tt-L12 protein was then purified in a single step by DE-cellulose column chromatography (Whatman) in buffer C. The insoluble GST·Tt-L10 and Ec-Tt-L10 proteins were solubilized in 8 m urea and purified by the same column chromatography as Ec-L10, described above. The purity of the proteins was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (see Fig. 2B). Formation of the L10·L12 Stalk Complex—The purified L10 and L12 proteins were individually dialyzed against buffer E, which consisted of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 300 mm KCl, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. An L10 protein (Ec-L10, GST·Tt-L10, or Ec-Tt-L10) was mixed with an L12 protein (Ec-L12, Tt-L12, or one of the chimeric L12 proteins) in buffer E at a molar ratio of 1:8. The complexes were formed by incubation at 37 °C for 5 min. In the case of the complex that contained GST·Tt-L10, the GST moiety was removed by digestion with PreScission Protease (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and subsequent heating at 70 °C for 30 min. The complexes that formed were analyzed by 6% polyacrylamide (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio 39:1) native gel electrophoresis at 6.5 V/cm with a buffer system that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl (35Nomura T. Mochizuki R. Dabbs E.R. Shimizu Y. Ueda T. Hachimori A. Uchiumi T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4691-4698Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was performed for 6 h at constant voltage and 4 °C with buffer circulation. Ribosomal Subunits and 50 S Core Particles—E. coli ribosomes and 50 and 30 S subunits were prepared as described previously (37Uchiumi T. Hori K. Nomura T. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27578-27582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 38Uchiumi T. Honma S. Nomura T. Dabbs E.R. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3857-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). 50 S core particles that were deficient in L10, L12, and L11 were obtained by treatment of 50 S subunits from the L11-deficient E. coli mutant strain AM68 (39Dabbs E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 734-737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with a solution that contained 50% ethanol and 0.5 m NH4Cl at 0 °C, as described previously (38Uchiumi T. Honma S. Nomura T. Dabbs E.R. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3857-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). 30 S subunits from E. coli strain Q13 were used for the functional assays in the present study. Analysis of Binding of the Chimeric Stalk Complexes to 50 S Core Particles—50 S core particles were mixed with L11 and various different L10·L12 complexes and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis on an acrylamide/agarose composite gel that was composed of 3% acrylamide (acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio 19:1) and 0.5% agarose (40Tokimatsu H. Strycharz W.A. Dahlberg A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 152: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), as described previously (37Uchiumi T. Hori K. Nomura T. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27578-27582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The gel was stained with 0.2% Azur B. Binding of the proteins to the 50 S core particles was revealed by gel mobility shift. Quantitative Analysis of L12 Incorporated into the Ribosome—The number of individual L12 proteins that were incorporated into a single 50 S core particle was determined according to Griaznova and Traut (17Griaznova O. Traut R.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4075-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because L12 contains no Cys residues for labeling with [14C]iodoacetamide, a single Cys was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (17Griaznova O. Traut R.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4075-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar): A63C in Ec-L12 or A68C in Tt-L12. The expressed and purified L12 samples were radiolabeled by incubation at 37 °C for 3 h in a solution that contained 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm [14C]iodoacetamide (65 mCi/mmol), as described (17Griaznova O. Traut R.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4075-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The labeled proteins were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 60 mm NH4Cl, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and their specific radioactivities were calculated from the protein concentration values, which were determined using a Micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and radioactivity, which was determined using a model 1600TR Tri-Carb liquid scintillation counter (Packard). 50 S core particles (50 pmol) were incubated with a 2-fold molar excess of an L10 protein and L11, together with a 12–16-fold molar excess of a radiolabeled L12 protein, in 50 μl of reconstitution buffer, which contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 60 mm NH4Cl, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 37 °C for 10 min, and then layered over a 20% sucrose cushion (1 ml) in the same buffer. The reconstituted 50 S particles were recovered by centrifugation at 60,000 rpm for 6 h at 4 °C in an S100AT4 rotor using an Hitachi micro-ultracentrifuge (CS100GX). The ribosomal pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of reconstitution buffer. The amount of radiolabeled L12 that was bound to each 50 S core particle was calculated from the radioactivity of the sample and the number of 50 S particles recovered, which was determined from the A260 (38.6 pmol of 50 S subunits/A260 unit). Ribosomal Function Assays—E. coli EF-G was cloned into the pET3a vector, overexpressed in E. coli cells (41Nomura T. Nakano K. Maki Y. Naganuma T. Nakashima T. Tanaka I. Kimura M. Hachimori A. Uchiumi T. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and purified from the cell extract by DEAE Sephadex A-50 column chromatography, as described (42Arai K.I. Kawakita M. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 7029-7037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EF-G-dependent GTPase activity was measured as described previously (37Uchiumi T. Hori K. Nomura T. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27578-27582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), except that the reaction mixture contained 2.5 pmol of 50 S subunits, 7.5 pmol of 30 S subunits, and 7 mm MgCl2. Footprinting Assay—70 S ribosomes (20 pmol) were preincubated in 50 μl of buffer that contained 7 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NH4Cl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 50 mm potassium cacodylate (pH 7.2) in the presence or absence of 40 pmol of EF-G, 1 mm fusidic acid, and 0.5 mm GTP. The ribosome samples were then mixed with 1 μl of dimethyl sulfate (a 1:4 dilution in ethanol) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. An aliquot of rRNA from each sample, which had been extracted with phenol, was analyzed by primer extension and gel electrophoresis as described by Moazed and Noller (43Moazed D. Noller H.F. Cell. 1986; 47: 985-994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The primer used was 5′-CTCGGGGCAAGTTTCGTGCT-3′, which binds within the 2660 domain and is complementary to nucleotides 2758–2777 of 23 S rRNA. High EF-G-dependent GTPase Turnover Activity with the Reconstituted T. thermophilus Stalk Protein Complex—Mixing of the purified wild-type Tt-L10 and Tt-L12 proteins resulted in the formation of a stable complex (33Nomura T. Nakatsuchi M. Sugita D. Nomura M. Kaminishi T. Takemoto C. Shirouzu M. Miyoshi T. Yokoyama S. Hachimori A. Uchiumi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2008; 144: 665-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This L10·L12 complex, together with Tt-L11, was assembled onto E. coli 50 S core particles that were deficient in the equivalent proteins (38Uchiumi T. Honma S. Nomura T. Dabbs E.R. Hachimori A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3857-3862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The functionality of the T. thermophilus proteins was assessed by measuring EF-G-dependent GTP hydrolysis. The activity was compared with that obtained with E. coli proteins that had been reconstituted under the same conditions (Fig. 1). The T. thermophilus L10·L12 complex, together with Tt-L11, yielded ribosomes with 2.5-fold higher activity than that of ribosomes that had been reconstituted with Ec-L10·L12 and Ec-L11. This higher activity seems to be mainly due to the T. thermophilus L10·L12 complex, because in the presence of Ec-L11, this complex still gave more than 2-fold higher activity than that of E. coli reconstituted ribosomes, whereas the Ec-L10·Ec-L12 complex in the presence of Tt-L11 did not markedly stimulate the GTPase activity. It is therefore likely that the higher activity is due to a structural feature of the Tt-L10·Tt-L12 complex. This might be either the presence of three Tt-L12 dimers or other structural elements that are found in each L12 molecule. Construction of Chimeric L10 and L12 Proteins from the E. coli and T. thermophilus Orthologs—Sequence comparisons show that the C-terminal α8 region of Tt-L10 contains an additional stretch of amino acids that is absent in Ec-L10. It has been suggested that this extra region is involved in the binding of the third Tt-L12 dimer (6Diaconu M. Kothe U. Schlu¨nzen F. Fischer N. Harms J.M. Tonevitsky A.G. Stark H. Rodnina M.V.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8192-8197Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We recently confirmed by biochemical approaches that the α8 region of Tt-L10 is involved in the binding of the three Tt-L12 dimers (33Nomura T. Nakatsuchi M. Sugita D"
