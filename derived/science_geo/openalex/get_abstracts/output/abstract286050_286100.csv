https://openalex.org/W2069182632,"A synthetic (reputed) kinin, SD 8339, at 1000 parts per million in alcohol solution, applied to flower clusters of a male grapevine about 3 weeks before anthesis, completely converted the flower sex from male to hermaphrodite. Indolebutyric acid, 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid, 2-chloroethyltrimethylammonium chloride beta-naphthoxyacetic acid, beta-indoleacetic acid, alpha-naphthaleneacetic acid, and gibberellin A(3) failed to modify the sex."

The mechanism is not known. Two corn crosses were studied. In one hybrid known to exhibit heterosis, the mitochondria and an artificial 1:1 mixture of parent mitochondria showed heterosis with respect to oxidation and phosphorylation. In the other cross, neither the hybrid plant, its mitochondria, nor the mixture of parent mitochondria showed heterosis."

This asymmetry is caused by unequal till thickness-3.6 meters on north slopes and 27.6 meters on south slopes. Previous workers interpreted the hills as being of bedrock sculptured by glacial erosion, with till 0.9 to 3 meters thick."

https://openalex.org/W2045056731,"The debris thrown into the stratosphere by the June 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo was supposed to give the world a break from the record-shattering global warmth of the 1980s. But throughout North America and much of northern Eurasia those expectations were confounded as the following winter proved unusually mild. Normally frigid Minneapolis, for example, had its third warmest winter ever, with temperatures averaging a relatively sultry 4.3[degree]C above normal. So the obvious question is, what might have temporarily counteracted Pinatubo's chilling effects on the northern continents The stratospheric haze created by Mt. Pinatubo did, as expected, screen out some sunlight and cool the globe as a whole. But recent evidence also suggests that it may have had the counter-intuitive effect of raising winter temperatures in large regions of North America and northern Eurasia by altering the weather patterns in those areas."

https://openalex.org/W1993825901,"Researchers have been trying to develop lasers that direct their light up through the top of a chip instead of out the side. But they've had little success in turning such lasers into efficient, practical emitters of the visible light prized for many applications. Now, researchers at Sandia National Laboratories have fashioned tiny surface-emitters that just may pass technological muster. In the 13 May issue of Electronics Letters, Sandia materials scientists Richard Schneider and James A. Lott report a new wrinkle on a technology familiar in the optoelectronics world-that of the so-called vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VSCELs). To make their VSCEL, the Sandia scientists relied on a fabrication technique known as metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy, which enables them to build up complex multilayered constructions, molecular layer by molecular layer. The light-emitting heart of these constructions is the optical cavity, composed of several 10-nanometer-thick layers of the semiconductor indium-aluminum-gallium-phosphide. The cavity's quantum mechanical properties, which depend partly on the precise thicknesses of its layers, the specific semiconductors used, and the mechanical strain between adjacent layers, turn it into so-called quantum well in which electric charges approaching from the layers above and below it get trapped and recombine to emit redmore » light. Bounding the cavity are complex mirrors made up of alternating sublayers of aluminum arsenide and aluminum gallium arsenide. The mirrors reflect and amplify the emitted light and pave a low resistance pathway into the cavity for electrons and holes - mobile positive charges. The electrical current that drives the laser enters through metal electrodes that are deposited onto the very top and bottom of the multilayered structure.« less"
