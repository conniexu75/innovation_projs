https://openalex.org/W75391772,"An analysis of new data concerning the sex of children born to the survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, together with a reanalysis of the data previously presented by Neel and Schull (9), reveals significant changes in the sex ratio of these children, changes in the direction to be expected if exposure had resulted in the induction of sex-linked lethal mutations (16)."

https://openalex.org/W2109457855,"The C/sup 14/ conient in sea mussels, land snails, fresh water mollusks, and algae was determined. The activities for both flesh and shell are tabulated as differences from the standard. As a check on the fractionation during growth, the C/sup 14/ conient was also measured. An increase of 4.3% in the C/sup 14/ content in the flesh of the land snail was observed between November 1953 and June 1957. There was only an increase of 1% in the shells. Isotopic fractionation and enviromnental differences are discussed. (J.S.R.)"

https://openalex.org/W1981451475,"In the investigation of alcoholic solutions of the quaternary base Hyamine for the counting of proteins and tissues, a phosphorescence phenomenon was encountered when working with larger weights of the substances. The protein- Hyamine solutions were usually heated between 50 and 70 d C for periods ranging from 1/2 hr to several hours. A count rate between 20.000 and 300,000 counts/min was observed with Hyamine-toluene-protein solutions of 100 mg portions of proteins. Solutions containing no toluene exhibited a phosphorescence which, however. was not as large. The count rate of both solutions would be increased by exposure to an incandescent lamp. The count rate decreased regularly, but slowly. The Hyamine solutions without protein showed no count. The cause of the phosphorescence is not known. (J.S.R.)"

https://openalex.org/W2076989353,"An investigation was made of the strontium content of human bone to determine the distribution of strontium among the different bones in an individual skeleton, to determine the distribution of strontium in the population of a single citv, and to extend the information on geographical variations. Although the average strontium content of the whole skeleton of an individual varied by a factor of 3, there was no systematic difference between any two bones of the body. A histogram of the strontium concentration in 133 individuals from New York City shows a nearly normal distribution. The data on the concentration of strontium in human bone in various geographical localities are tabulated. (J.S.R.)"

It is plain that a given biological effect can be evoked by peptides which differ considerably. It is likewise plain that the effect cannot be evoked by a number of other peptides. There is apparently some specificity, but more is involved than that incorporated in the classical view."

https://openalex.org/W2013064513,"Europe, traditionally the breeding ground for basic scientific research until the 1930's, is only now approaching full recovery from the devastating effects of the war. Great Britain has a more stimulating climate for research, a more progressive graduate-school program, and a more flexible professorship structure than any other country of Europe. Germany still has several years to go before the effects of the war will be obliterated. In most northern European countries, the organization and support of academic research ranges from good to excellent, and a stimulating intellectual atmosphere exists. Germany is rapidly contending for the lead in basic research along with England and Sweden, which are now in the forefront. The Netherlands is typified by superb organization, and most of the Scandinavian countries are high in quality if not always in quantity of research. France is characterized by brilliant individual contributions but over-all falls far short of her potential for scientific research. Switzerland, a highly industrialized country, is geared primarily for engineering and does not compete as highly on basic research as might otherwise be expected. Italian research is good in certain areas but is plagued by a number of difficulties that retard progress. Nevertheless, there are encouraging efforts being made in Italy to develop some good scientific programs. In the south of Europe the situation is generally discouraging and will continue to be so, except where a few dedicated, brilliant individuals are making good contributions with the meager resources available. Europe will continue to be a tremendous scientific manpower reserve for the United States, and, despite accusations of proselyting, the fact remains that in many European countries the employment possibilities are not commensurate with the production rate of scientists and engineers. If the universities of Europe would realign the professional structure of their departmental staffs and extend their graduate curricula they would give far more opportunity to young research scientists and make better use of their facilities. America can indeed be grateful to Europe for a great cultural and academic heritage, and one can sincerely hope that close cooperation in science will take place for many years to come."

https://openalex.org/W2089168706,Data are presented from studies on mice which indicate how varied the life-shortening effects of partialand whole-body exposure can be and the difficulties in attempting to extrapolate from one to the other. They also indicate how tenuous the quantitative estimates of life shortening in man must be when they are based on the relatively incomplete data currently available for experimental animals. (C.H. )
