https://openalex.org/W2025376383,"In the present-day climate, surface water salinities are low in the western tropical Pacific Ocean and increase towards the eastern part of the basin. The salinity of surface waters in the tropical Pacific Ocean is thought to be controlled by a combination of atmospheric convection, precipitation, evaporation and ocean dynamics, and on interannual timescales significant variability is associated with the El Niño/Southern Oscillation cycles. However, little is known about the variability of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system on timescales of centuries to millennia. Here we combine oxygen isotope and Mg/Ca data from foraminifers retrieved from three sediment cores in the western tropical Pacific Ocean to reconstruct Holocene sea surface temperatures and salinities in the region. We find a decrease in sea surface temperatures of approximately 0.5 degrees C over the past 10,000 yr, whereas sea surface salinities decreased by approximately 1.5 practical salinity units. Our data imply either that the Pacific basin as a whole has become progressively less salty or that the present salinity gradient along the Equator has developed relatively recently."
https://openalex.org/W1968024446,"Seismic data provide images of crust-mantle interactions during ongoing removal of the dense batholithic root beneath the southern Sierra Nevada mountains in California. The removal appears to have initiated between 10 and 3 Myr ago with a Rayleigh-Taylor-type instability, but with a pronounced asymmetric flow into a mantle downwelling (drip) beneath the adjacent Great Valley. A nearly horizontal shear zone accommodated the detachment of the ultramafic root from its granitoid batholith. With continuing flow into the mantle drip, viscous drag at the base of the remaining approximately 35-km-thick crust has thickened the crust by approximately 7 km in a narrow welt beneath the western flank of the range. Adjacent to the welt and at the top of the drip, a V-shaped cone of crust is being dragged down tens of kilometres into the core of the mantle drip, causing the disappearance of the Moho in the seismic images. Viscous coupling between the crust and mantle is therefore apparently driving present-day surface subsidence."
https://openalex.org/W2100149169,"Enzymes that are able to oxidatively cleave carotenoids at specific positions have been identified in animals and plants. The first such enzyme to be identified was a nine-cis-epoxy carotenoid dioxygenase from maize, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step of abscisic acid biosynthesis. Similar enzymes are necessary for the synthesis of vitamin A in animals and other carotenoid-derived molecules in plants. In the model plant, Arabidopsis, there are nine hypothetical proteins that share some degree of sequence similarity to the nine-cis-epoxy carotenoid dioxygenases. Five of these proteins appear to be involved in abscisic acid biosynthesis. The remaining four proteins are expected to catalyze other carotenoid cleavage reactions and have been named carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs). The hypothetical proteins, AtCCD7 and AtCCD8, are the most disparate members of this protein family in Arabidopsis. The max3 and max4 mutants in Arabidopsis result from lesions in AtCCD7 and AtCCD8. Both mutants display a dramatic increase in lateral branching and are believed to be impaired in the synthesis of an unidentified compound that inhibits axillary meristem development. To determine the biochemical function of AtCCD7, the protein was expressed in carotenoid-accumulating strains of Escherichia coli. The activity of AtCCD7 was also tested in vitro with several of the most common plant carotenoids. It was shown that the recombinant AtCCD7 protein catalyzes a specific 9-10 cleavage of β-carotene to produce the 10 ▾-apo-β-carotenal (C27) and β-ionone (C13). When AtCCD7 and AtCCD8 were co-expressed in a β-carotene-producing strain of E. coli, the 13-apo-β-carotenone (C18) was produced. The C18 product appears to result from a secondary cleavage of the AtCCD7-derived C27 product. The sequential cleavages of β-carotene by AtCCD7 and AtCCD8 are likely the initial steps in the synthesis of a carotenoid-derived signaling molecule that is necessary for the regulation lateral branching.

The sequential cleavages of β-carotene by AtCCD7 and AtCCD8 are likely the initial steps in the synthesis of a carotenoid-derived signaling molecule that is necessary for the regulation lateral branching. Apocarotenoids are a diverse class of compounds that are derived from the oxidative cleavage of carotenoids. These compounds serve important biological functions in a variety of organisms. Vitamin A, for example, is required for vision and development in animals. In plants, abscisic acid is necessary for seed development and adaptation to various environmental stresses. The synthesis of these apocarotenoids and others is catalyzed by a class of oxygenases that cleave specific double bonds resulting in two products with carbonyls at the site of cleavage. For many years it was believed that the enzymes that catalyze these reactions were dioxygenases. In a recent study, it was found that oxygen in one of the products comes from water (1Leuenberger M.G. Engeloch-Jarret C. Woggon W.D. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2001; 40: 2614-2617Crossref Google Scholar), indicating that these enzymes may be monooxygenases. For simplicity, all enzymes will be referred to the name given when originally described. In plants, nine-cis-epoxy-carotenoid dioxygenases (NCEDs) 1The abbreviations used are: NCED, nine-cis-epoxy-carotenoid dioxygenase; CCD, carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ORF, open reading frame. catalyze the rate-limiting step in abscisic acid biosynthesis. An NCED from maize was the first carotenoid cleavage enzyme to be cloned and characterized (2Schwartz S.H. Tan B.C. Gage D.A. Zeevaart J.A.D. McCarty D.R.

The enzymes that cleave β-carotene to form two molecules of retinal in animals also belong to this family (11Lindqvist A. Andersson S. J. Biol.

Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Within the genome sequence of the model plant, Arabidopsis, there are nine hypothetical proteins that share some degree of sequence similarity to the NCEDs. Five of these proteins are believed to be involved in abscisic acid synthesis (15Iuchi S. Kobayashi M. Taji T. Naramoto M. Seki M. Kato T. Tabata S. Kakubari Y. Yamaguchi-Shinozaki K. Shinozaki K. Plant J. 2001; 27: 325-333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four members of this protein family in Arabidopsis do not cluster with previously characterized NCEDs and are considered unlikely to be abscisic acid biosynthetic enzymes. These proteins may, however, catalyze other carotenoid cleavage reactions and are more appropriately referred to as carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs). The AtCCD1 protein, for example, catalyzes the symmetric 9-10, 9′-10′ cleavage of various carotenoids (8Schwartz S.H. Qin X.Q. Zeevaart J.A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25208-25211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The specific biochemical functions for the remaining three CCDs from Arabidopsis (AtCCD4, -7, and -8) have not yet been reported. The max4 mutant in Arabidopsis and the rms1 mutant in pea result from a lesion in AtCCD8 and a pea ortholog (16Sorefan K. Booker J. Haurogne K. Goussot M. Bainbridge K. Foo E. Chatfield S. Ward S. Beveridge C. Rameau C. Leyser O. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Both mutants display an increase in lateral branching and are believed to be impaired in the synthesis of an unknown compound that inhibits axillary meristem development or bud outgrowth. The max3 mutant also displays an increase in lateral branching that results from a lesion in the AtCCD7 gene (17Booker J. Auldridge M. Wills S. McCarty D. Klee H. Leyser O. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1232-1238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), indicating that AtCCD7 is also involved in the synthesis of this inhibitor. The biochemical characterization of AtCCD7 and AtCCD8 is an important step in identifying the biologically active compound. It has been reported that the expression of AtCCD7 in carotenoid-producing strains of Escherichia coli results in a reduced accumulation of carotenoids and the production of some apocarotenoids (17Booker J. Auldridge M. Wills S. McCarty D. Klee H. Leyser O. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1232-1238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). However, the specific reaction catalyzed by AtCCD7 has not yet been established. It is demonstrated here that the recombinant AtCCD7 protein catalyzes a 9-10 cleavage of β-carotene to produce the 10′-apo-β-carotenal (C27) and β-ionone (C13). The AtCCD8 protein is able to catalyze a secondary cleavage of the 10′-apo-β-carotenal at the 13-14 position to produce the 13-apo-β-carotenone (C18). Cloning of AtCCD7 and AtCCD8 —A cDNA clone of AtCCD7 was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR with RNA isolated from 1-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings. Total RNA was reverse transcribed with Superscript from Invitrogen and an 18-mer oligo (dT) primer. The AtCCD7 gene was then amplified with platinum Taq polymerase from Invitrogen and the primers listed in Table I. The sequence of the cloned cDNA was identical with the sequence in GenBank™ (NM_130064). The AtCCD8 ORF in the pUNI51 vector was produced by the Salk/Stanford/PGEC consortium (18Yamada K. Lim J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 24349-24352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), 2-ml cultures were grown overnight in LB medium with 100 μg ml-1 ampicillin and 35 μg ml-1 chloramphenicol. The overnight cultures were used to inoculate a 30-ml culture of LB with the same antibiotics. After 24 h at 28 °C, 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added, and the cultures were left at room temperature for an additional 48 h. At the same time the recombinant protein was expressed, ferrous sulfate was added to a final concentration of 10 mg liter-1. For quantitative analysis of carotenoid accumulation, 1 ml of culture was centrifuged, and the medium was discarded. The cell pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of formaldehyde, and then 1 ml of the ethanol was added. The tubes were placed at 4 °C for 3 h before the cell debris was removed by centrifugation. For β-carotene- and zeaxanthin-accumulating strains of E. coli, absorbance was measured with a spectrophotometer at 453 nm. For the lycopene-accumulating strains, absorbance was measured at 472 nm. The carotenoid content was calculated with known extinction coefficients. For analysis of apocarotenoid products, a culture was centrifuged, and the cell pellet was extracted sequentially with formaldehyde, methanol, and diethyl ether. The media were partitioned into an equal volume of diethyl ether. Both the cell extract and the medium partition were washed with water, and the diethyl ether layer was retained. The volume of the diethyl ether was reduced under nitrogen, and a solution of 10% KOH in methanol was added to saponify the samples. After 30 min, the samples were partitioned into diethyl ether and washed with water. The diethyl ether layer was dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen, and the samples were stored at -80 °C until HPLC analysis. The E. coli extracts were analyzed on a Waters 600 HPLC (Milford, MA) equipped with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector. Samples were injected on a 5-μm C18 Adsorbosil column from Alltech (Deerfield, IL) and eluted with 50% acetonitrile and water at 1 ml min-1 for 4 min followed by a linear gradient to 100% acetonitrile over 16 min. The gradient was then shifted to 100% acetone over 12 min and left at 100% acetone for an additional 5 min. In Vitro Assays with Recombinant AtCCD7—For protein expression, 5 ml of an overnight culture was used to inoculate a 100-ml culture in 2× YT medium (per liter: 16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl). Cultures were grown at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.7 was reached. Expression of proteins was induced by the addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cultures were grown at 28 °C for an additional 5 h. The E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 4 ml of lysis buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 μg lysozyme, and 100 units of endonuclease). The cells were left on ice for 20 min and then frozen in liquid nitrogen. After cells were thawed, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.25%, and the cells were shaken on ice for 30 min. The recombinant protein was bound to glutathione-agarose from Sigma, washed three times with Tris-buffered saline, and then released by cleavage with Factor Xa from Novagen (Madison, WI) for 7 h at 4 °C. The carotenoid substrates were extracted from plant tissues and purified by HPLC as described previously (20Rock C.D. Zeevaart J.A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7496-7499Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Assays contained 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm FeSO4, 5 mm ascorbate, and the appropriate carotenoid substrate in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.0. The assay products were partitioned into ethyl acetate, dried under N2, and analyzed by HPLC or thin-layer chromatography. To determine the Km and Vmax values, the Michaelis-Menten equation was solved by non-linear regression using Sigma Plot 4.01 from Jandel Scientific (San Rafael, CA). The Co-expression of AtCCD7 and AtCCD8 in Carotenoid-accumulating Strains of E. coli—For expression of AtCCD8 or co-expression of AtCCD7 and AtCCD8, the BL21 (AI) strain from Invitrogen was used, and cultures were grown as described above. For induction of the tac promoter expressing AtCCD7, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. Induction of the AtCCD8 protein, under the control of a T7 promoter, was achieved by the addition of 0.02% arabinose. The cells and media were extracted and analyzed as described above. Characterization of Apocarotenoid Products—The apocarotenoid products were purified by reverse phase HPLC (described above), reduced with NaBH4, and further purified by normal phase HPLC on an analytical μporasil column from Waters Corporation (Milford, MA) that was equilibrated with 97:3 (hexane:ethyl acetate) at 2 ml min-1. The column was eluted with a linear gradient to 50% ethyl acetate over 12 min. Fractions were collected, dried, and dissolved in hexane to determine their absorption spectra. The C27 product of AtCCD7, 10′-apo-β-carotenal, and the NaBH4 reduced form were also analyzed by positive ion fast atom bombardment. Samples were introduced by direct insertion probe with 3-nitrobenzyl alcohol as the matrix. The molecular ions (M ▾ and M ▾ +1) for the 10′-apo-β-carotenal and carotenol were apparent. A high-resolution spectrum for the M ▾ of the 10′-apo-β-carotenol was also obtained. The trimethylsilyl derivative of the 13-apo-β-carotenol was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with a DB5-MS column (30 m with an inner diameter of 0.32 mm, 0.25-μm film, J&W Scientific) and the following temperature program: 100 °C for 1 min, 100-230 °C at 40 °C/min, 230-280 °C at 8 °C/min, and 280-300 °C at 20 °C/min. Expression of ATCCD7 in Carotenoid-accumulating Strains of E. coli—To determine the reactions catalyzed by AtCCD7, a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein was expressed in several carotenoid-accumulating strains of E. coli. In previous studies, the expression of a functional carotenoid cleavage enzyme in these strains resulted in a reduced or altered color development (8Schwartz S.H. Qin X.Q. Zeevaart J.A.D. J. Biol.

A moderate level of AtCCD7 expression in a lycopene-producing strain (pACLYC) or zeaxanthin-producing strain (pACZEAX) had little effect on color development (Fig. 1, A and B). Conversely, expression of AtCCD7 in a β-carotene-producing strain (pACBETA) had a significant effect on the accumulation of this carotenoid (Fig. 1, A and B). The cells and media from the AtCCD7 expression strains were extracted and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC. Two major compounds were detected in the pACBETA/AtCCD7 strain that were not detected in the pACBETA strain with an empty vector. One product had a UV-visible spectrum and retention time that was identical to β-ionone (C13) (Fig. 2A). The second product had a UV-visible spectrum that was consistent with the 10′-apo-β-carotenol (C27) (Fig. 2B) (22Kiefer C. Hessel S. Lampert J.M. Vogt K. Lederer M.O. Breithaupt D.E. von Lintig J. J.

Nutr. 2000; 130: 1996-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Several smaller peaks, which had similar retention times and absorption spectra, are most likely cis isomers of the C27 product. These apocarotenoids would result from the 9-10 cleavage of β-carotene (Fig. 3). The initial cleavage product would be an aldehyde, but it is subsequently reduced to the corresponding alcohol by E. coli. The reduction of the aldehyde cleavage products to alcohols by E. coli has been reported previously (8Schwartz S.H. Qin X.Q. Zeevaart J.A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25208-25211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 13von Lintig J. Vogt K. J. Biol.

When AtCCD7 was expressed in a lycopene-producing strain of E. coli, a small amount of a compound with a UV-visible spectrum similar to the10′-apolycopenol was detected (Fig. 2C). No apocarotenoid products were detected when AtCCD7 was expressed in a zeaxanthin-accumulating strain.Fig. 3The 9-10 cleavage of β-carotene catalyzed by the recombinant AtCCD7 protein and the subsequent reduction of the 10 ▾-apo-β-carotenal to the corresponding alcohol by E. coli or NaBH4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In Vitro Assays with Recombinant AtCCD7—To further explore the specificity of AtCCD7 and delimit the endogenous substrates, in vitro assays were performed with the affinity-purified protein and several common plant carotenoids. These assays were analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (Fig. 4) and HPLC (supplemental Fig. 2). No products were detected with lycopene, lutein, zeaxanthin, violaxanthin, or neoxanthin as substrates. A single product was apparent in assays with β-carotene. The UV-visible spectra of the enzyme product and of the NaBH4 reduced form were very similar to published spectra for the 10′-apo-β-carotenal and the 10′-apo-β-carotenol, respectively (supplemental Fig. 2B) (23Barua A.B. Olson J.A. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1996-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The [M] ▾ and [M + H] ▾ ions for the 10′-apo-β-carotenal and 10′-apo-β-carotenol were detected by fast atom bombardment-mass spectroscopy, and a high-resolution spectrum of the reduced product matched the molecular formula for the 10′-apo-β-carotenol, C27H38O. The calculated mass of the apocarotenol is 378.29230, whereas the experimentally determined mass of the compound was 378.2928 (an error of 1.3 ppm from the calculated). The AtCCD7 protein contains a probable chloroplast targeting sequence of 31 amino acids (TargetP V1.01), which is consistent with a role in carotenoid metabolism. A truncated AtCCD7 protein (587 amino acids) lacking the N-terminal targeting sequence was also able to catalyze the 9-10 cleavage of β-carotene (data not shown). The addition of water-miscible organic solvents has been shown to enhance the activity of lignostilbene dioxygenases (24Makoto N. Kamoda S. Saburi Y. J. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 11: 884-886Google Scholar), which share sequence similarity to the CCDs and catalyze a similar double bond cleavage reaction. The addition of methanol to in vitro assays with AtCCD7 had a stimulatory effect on activity at concentrations up to 25% (data not shown). The kinetic values for the standard reaction were: Km = 15.2 μm and Vmax = 4.5 pmol/mg of protein/min. With the addition of 25% methanol, the Km and Vmax values increased to 20.0 μm and 10.1 pmol/mg of protein/min. Co-expression of AtCCD7 and AtCCD8 in Carotenoid-accumulating Strains—No apocarotenoids were detected with the expression of AtCCD8 in the carotenoid-accumulating strains of E. coli (data not shown). Because mutations in AtCCD7 and AtCCD8 result in the same phenotype, it is likely that the two gene products function in the same pathway. So, a construct for the co-expression of AtCCD7 and AtCCD8 was transformed into the carotenoid-accumulating strains. In addition to the AtCCD7 cleavage products, β-ionone and the 10′-apo-β-carotenol, a third product was identified in the β-carotene co-expression strain (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. 1D). The absorption spectrum of the product in hexane before and after reduction with NaBH4 (Fig. 5B) is similar to the 13-apo-β-carotenone and carotenol (C18) (25Das P.K. Becker R.S. J. Phys. Chem. 1978; 82: 2081-2093Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A trimethylsilyl derivative of the reduced product was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Fig. 6). The observed molecular ion of 332 is the expected mass for the trimethylsilyl derivative of the 13-apo-β-carotenol. An authentic standard of 13-apo-β-carotenone was produced according to a synthesis described previously (26Tanumihardjo S.A. J. Label. Compd. Radiopharm. 2001; 44: 365-372Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The chromatography, UV-visible spectra, and mass spectra of the E. coli product and the synthetic product were the same.Fig. 6Mass spectrum of the trimethylsilyl derivative of 13-apo-β-carotenol isolated from a β-carotene-accumulating strain ofE. colithat is co-expressing AtCCD7 and AtCCD8.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The absence of the 13-apo-β-carotenone when AtCCD8 is expressed alone in the β-carotene strain indicates that ATCCD8 cleaves the C27 product, the 10′-apo-β-carotenal or carotenol (Fig. 7). A C9 product may also result from this cleavage reaction, but it has not yet been identified. To determine whether the synthesis of the 13-apo-β-carotenone required a specific interaction between the AtCCD7 and AtCCD8 proteins, a construct was made for the co-expression of β-Diox II from mouse and AtCCD8. The β-Diox II also catalyzes a 9-10 cleavage of β-carotene (22Kiefer C. Hessel S. Lampert J.M. Vogt K. Lederer M.O. Breithaupt D.E. von Lintig J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14110-14116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), but it shares only 13% identity and 23% similarity with AtCCD7. Co-expression of β-Diox II and AtCCD8 also resulted in the production of 13-apo-β-carotenone (Fig. 5C). The more axillary branching mutants, max3 and max4, result from lesions in the AtCCD7 and AtCCD8 genes, respectively (16Sorefan K. Booker J. Haurogne K. Goussot M. Bainbridge K. Foo E. Chatfield S. Ward S. Beveridge C. Rameau C. Leyser O. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 17Booker J. Auldridge M. Wills S. McCarty D. Klee H. Leyser O. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1232-1238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Because of an inability to repress the outgrowth of axillary buds, the max mutants display an increase in lateral branching and have a bushy appearance. In many plants, the outgrowth of axillary buds is inhibited by the shoot apex. This phenomenon is often referred to as apical dominance and is regulated in large part by the plant hormone, auxin. Auxin is synthesized in the shoot apex and transported to the base of the plant where it inhibits lateral bud outgrowth. If the shoot apex is damaged, auxin levels are reduced and lateral buds may be released from dormancy. There are, however, several lines of evidence to indicate that auxin does not inhibit the outgrowth of axillary buds directly. Grafting experiments with branching mutants in various species have provided strong evidence for the existence of another long-distance signal that inhibits the outgrowth of axillary buds. The phenotype of several branching mutants in pea (rms1, -2, and -5), the max1, 3, and 4 mutants in Arabidopsis, and the decreased apical dominance mutant in petunia (dad1-1) can be rescued by grafting to a wild type rootstock (16Sorefan K.

These results indicate that a compound that is synthesized in the root is capable of inhibiting axillary bud outgrowth. Because the compound moves acropetally from the root to the shoot, it is most likely transported through the xylem. Considering that the AtCCD7 and AtCCD8 proteins are similar to carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases characterized previously, it is likely that the inhibitor of axillary bud outgrowth is a carotenoid-derived molecule (2Schwartz S.H. Tan B.C. Gage D.A. Zeevaart J.A.D. McCarty D.R. Science. 1997; 276: 1872-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar, 8Schwartz S.H. Qin X.Q. Zeevaart J.A.D. J. Biol.

In plants, the cyclization of lycopene is a major branch point in carotenoid biosynthesis. The introduction of two β-rings produces β-carotene, which may subsequently be converted to zeaxanthin, violaxanthin, and neoxanthin. The introduction of a β-ring and an ϵ-ring produces α-carotene, which is converted primarily to lutein in most tissues. The lut2 mutant in Arabidopsis is unable to produce α-carotene and lutein (30Pogson B. McDonald K.A. Truong M. Britton G. DellaPenna D. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 1627-1639Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) and has no branching phenotype. Therefore, it is unlikely that either of these carotenoids is a precursor of the lateral branch inhibitor. By the same rationale, mutants impaired in epoxy-carotenoid synthesis (20Rock C.D. Zeevaart J.A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7496-7499Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) indicate that violaxanthin and neoxanthin are not the precursors of the lateral branching inhibitor. The most likely precursor of the branching inhibitor would then be zeaxanthin, β-carotene, or an acyclic precursor. The recombinant AtCCD7 protein was able to catalyze the 9-10 cleavage of β-carotene to produce the 10′-apo-β-carotenol (C27) and β-ionone (C13). The AtCCD1 protein and homologs from other plants also catalyze a 9-10 cleavage reaction (8Schwartz S.H. Qin X.Q. Zeevaart J.A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25208-25211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 10Bouvier F. Suire C. Mutterer J. Camara B. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 47-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). There are, however, several key distinctions between the reactions catalyzed by AtCCD1 and AtCCD7. The recombinant AtCCD1 protein cleaves various carotenoids symmetrically at both the 9-10 and 9′-10′ positions. Therefore, AtCCD1 does not produce the 10′-apo-β-carotenal. Because AtCCD7 and AtCCD8 have both been implicated in the synthesis of a lateral branching inhibitor, the two proteins were co-expressed in the carotenoid-accumulating strains of E. coli. When co-expressed in the β-carotene-accumulating strain, the C27 and C13 products of AtCCD7 were detected. A third product was also produced by this strain and identified as the 13-apo-β-carotenone (C18). Because this product was not detected when AtCCD8 was expressed by itself, it most likely results from a secondary cleavage of the C27 product of AtCCD7. A C9 product may also result from this cleavage reaction, but it has not yet been identified. The lignostilbene dioxygenases, which share sequence similarity with the CCDs and catalyze a similar cleavage reaction, have been shown to function as homodimers or heterodimers (32Kamoda S. Saburi Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1993; 57: 931-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Direct analysis of AtCCD7 and AtCCD8 dimer formation was complicated because the majority of the recombinant AtCCD8 protein was insoluble (data not shown). The C18 compound was also produced when AtCCD8 was co-expressing with a 9-10 cleavage enzyme from mouse (β-Diox II), providing indirect evidence that dimerization is not essential for the activity of AtCCD8. Formation of an AtCCD7-AtCCD8 heterodimer could, however, increase the rate of the second cleavage reaction. The phenotype of the max3/atccd7 and max4/atccd8 mutants and the biochemical evidence presented here suggest that AtCCD7 and AtCCD8 are necessary for the synthesis of an apocarotenoid that inhibits axillary bud outgrowth. The cleavage of β-carotene by AtCCD7 to a C27 product is likely the first committed step in the biosynthetic pathway of this inhibitor. The C27 product may subsequently be cleaved by AtCCD8 to form the 13-apo-β-carotenone (C18) and a C9 product. Either of the AtCCD8 cleavage products could give rise to the biologically active inhibitor. Grafting experiments with the max1 mutant in Arabidopsis indicate that this mutant is also impaired in the synthesis of the branching inhibitor (29Turnbull C.G.N. Booker J.P. Leyser H.M. Plant J. 2002; 32: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that there is one additional step in the pathway. The identification of the biologically active compound will require the characterization of the MAX1 gene product and the development of a bioassay to confirm the role of the inhibitor in regulating lateral branching.

The glycoconjugates are inactive and are thought to play a role in homeostasis of the hormones. Although O-glucosyltransferases have been identified that recognize cytokinins, the enzymes involved in N-glucosylation have not been identified even though the process has been recognized for many years. This study utilizes a screening strategy in which 105 recombinant glycosyltransferases (UGTs) of Arabidopsis have been analyzed for catalytic activity toward the classical cytokinins: trans-zeatin, dihydrozeatin, N6-benzyladenine, N6-isopentenyladenine, and kinetin. Five UGTs were identified in the screen. UGT76C1 and UGT76C2 recognized all cytokinins and glucosylated the hormones at the N7 and N9 positions. UGT85A1, UGT73C5, and UGT73C1 recognized trans-zeatin and dihydrozeatin, which have an available hydroxyl group for glucosylation and formed the O-glucosides. The biochemical characteristics of the N-glucosyltransferases were analyzed, and highly effective inhibitors of their activities were identified. Constitutive overexpression of UGT76C1 in transgenic Arabidopsis confirmed that the recombinant enzyme functioned in vivo to glucosylate cytokinin applied to the plant. The role of the N-glucosyltransferases in cytokinin metabolism is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2021803142,"Not all noise in experimental measurements is unwelcome. Certain fundamental noise sources contain valuable information about the system itself-a notable example being the inherent voltage fluctuations (Johnson noise) that exist across any resistor, which allow the temperature to be determined. In magnetic systems, fundamental noise can exist in the form of random spin fluctuations. For example, statistical fluctuations of N paramagnetic spins should generate measurable noise of order N spins, even in zero magnetic field. Here we exploit this effect to perform perturbation-free magnetic resonance. We use off-resonant Faraday rotation to passively detect the magnetization noise in an equilibrium ensemble of paramagnetic alkali atoms; the random fluctuations generate spontaneous spin coherences that precess and decay with the same characteristic energy and timescales as the macroscopic magnetization of an intentionally polarized or driven ensemble. Correlation spectra of the measured spin noise reveal g-factors, nuclear spin, isotope abundance ratios, hyperfine splittings, nuclear moments and spin coherence lifetimes-without having to excite, optically pump or otherwise drive the system away from thermal equilibrium. These noise signatures scale inversely with interaction volume, suggesting a possible route towards non-perturbative, sourceless magnetic resonance of small systems."

This study was undertaken to examine the recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells by Drosophila hemocytes/macrophages in vitro and in vivo. In the in vitro analysis, l(2)mbn cells (a cell line established from larval hemocytes of a tumorous Drosophila mutant) were used as phagocytes. When l(2)mbn cells were treated with the molting hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone, the cells acquired the ability to phagocytose apoptotic S2 cells, another Drosophila cell line. S2 cells undergoing cycloheximide-induced apoptosis exposed phosphatidylserine on their surface, but their engulfment by l(2)mbn cells did not seem to be mediated by phosphatidylserine. The level of Croquemort, a candidate phagocytosis receptor of Drosophila hemocytes/macrophages, increased in l(2)mbn cells after treatment with 20-hydroxyecdysone, whereas that of Draper, another candidate phagocytosis receptor, remained unchanged. However, apoptotic cell phagocytosis was reduced when the expression of Draper, but not of Croquemort, was inhibited by RNA interference in hormone-treated l(2)mbn cells. We next examined whether Draper is responsible for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in vivo using an assay for engulfment based on assessing DNA degradation of apoptotic cells in dICAD mutant embryos (which only occurred after ingestion by the phagocytes). RNA interference-mediated decrease in the level of Draper in embryos of mutant flies was accompanied by a decrease in the number of cells containing fragmented DNA. Furthermore, histochemical analyses of dispersed embryonic cells revealed that the level of phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by hemocytes/macrophages was reduced when Draper expression was inhibited.

This process contributes not only to the clearance of unnecessary or spent cells from the body but also to maintaining tissue homeostasis (3Ren Y. Savill J.

The mechanism underlying phagocytosis of apoptotic cells consists of various distinct events such as the migration of phagocytes toward the site of apoptosis, the recognition and engulfment of apoptotic cells by phagocytes, processing of engulfed apoptotic cells in phagocytes, and alteration of gene expression in engulfing phagocytes. Although investigation of these phenomena has recently become intensive, the molecular basis of each event largely remains unclear. The phagocytic elimination of apoptotic cells is considered to be an innate immune response, because the underlying mechanism does not require the action of protein products of rearranged genes (9Greenberg S. Grinstein S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 10Gordon S.

Thus, clarification of the mechanisms and consequences of this phenomenon should lead to a better understanding of the cellular response in innate immunity. Apoptotic cells bind to phagocytes through recognition of marker molecules that are expressed at their surfaces (4Savill J. Fadok V.

PS is normally restricted to the inner leaflet of the membrane bilayer but translocates to the outer leaflet and is exposed on the cell surface during apoptosis (13Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Frasch S.C.

Externalized PS serves as a “phagocytosis marker” (i.e. phagocytes recognize apoptotic cells by using either membrane-bound PS receptors or PS-binding soluble “bridge” molecules) (15Schlegel R.A.

The importance of PS-mediated phagocytosis of apoptotic cells for the development of various organs and tissues has recently been shown in the mouse (19Li M.O. Sarkisian M.R. Mehal W.Z. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Science. 2003; 302: 1560-1563Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 20Kunisaki Y. Masuko S. Noda M. Inayoshi A. Sanui T. Harada M. Sasazuki T. Fukui Y. Blood. 2004; 103: 3362-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) by disrupting a gene coding for the macrophage PS receptor (21Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Rose D.M. Pearson A. Ezekewitz R.A.B. Henson P.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar). The existence of two seemingly independent signaling pathways for the induction of engulfment has been genetically identified in Caenorhabditis elegans (22Horvitz H.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1701s-1706sPubMed Google Scholar). However, the nature of receptors that exist farthest upstream of these pathways has been unknown until recently. In C. elegans, CED-1 has been suggested to serve as a receptor for one pathway that involves CED-6, CED-7, and CED-10, although the cognate ligand remains to be identified (14Chimini G. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 23Gumienny T.L. Hengartner M.O. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 564-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24Zhou Z. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 2001; 104: 43-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Surface receptors responsible for the other pathway (which involves CED-2, CED-5, CED-10, and CED-12) may include PSR-1, which is encoded by psr-1, the C. elegans homologue of the gene coding for the macrophage PS receptor (25Wang X. Wu Y.-C. Fadok V.A. Lee M.-C. Gengyo-Ando K. Cheng L.-C. Ledwich D. Hsu P.-K. Chen J.-Y. Chou B.-K. Henson P. Mitani S. Xue D. Science. 2003; 302: 1563-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). All of the above-mentioned genes possess mammalian counterparts, suggesting that mammalian phagocytes use the same two pathways to engulf apoptotic cells (26Lauber K. Blumenthal S.G. Waibel M. Wesselborg S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). On the other hand, much less is known about the interactions between dying cells and phagocytes in Drosophila. Croquemort, a member of the CD36 family of proteins (27Franc N.C. Dimarcq J.-L. Lagueux M. Hoffmann J. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Immunity. 1996; 4: 431-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), is specifically expressed in hemocytes/macrophages (27Franc N.C. Dimarcq J.-L. Lagueux M. Hoffmann J. Ezekowitz R.A.B. Immunity. 1996; 4: 431-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and has been shown genetically to be involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells in Drosophila embryos (28Franc N.C. Heitzler P. Ezekowitz R.A.B. White K. Science. 1999; 284: 1991-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Croquemort appears to be structurally unrelated to either CED-1 or PSR-1, and how it transduces signal(s) for phagocytosis, including the identity of its ligand, remains unknown. On the other hand, Draper, which is encoded by draper, is a Drosophila homologue of ced-1 and is expressed in two types of phagocytes, namely glia and hemocytes/macrophages (29Freeman M.R. Delrow J. Kim J. Johnson E. Doe C.Q. Neuron. 2003; 38: 567-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Draper is therefore another candidate phagocytosis receptor in this organism. In fact, deletion of the draper locus in embryos showed an increased number of apoptotic neurons in the central nervous system, suggesting the involvement of this molecule in glial phagocytosis of apoptotic neurons (29Freeman M.R. Delrow J. Kim J. Johnson E. Doe C.Q. Neuron. 2003; 38: 567-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). It is thus likely that at least one of the two signaling pathways found in C. elegans also exists in Drosophila. Although the existence of the Drosophila homologue of the gene coding for the macrophage PS receptor has been noted (21Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. Rose D.M. Pearson A. Ezekewitz R.A.B. Henson P.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar), its involvement in phagocytosis in Drosophila is unknown. A large number of cells undergo apoptosis during development of Drosophila and are eliminated through phagocytosis by macrophage-like hemocytes or glia (30Abrams J.M. White K. Fessler L.I. Steller H. Development. 1993; 117: 29-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Sonnenfeld M.J. Jacobs J.R. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 359: 644-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined the mode of phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in Drosophila both in vitro and in vivo, focusing on the involvement of PS on target cells and Croquemort and Draper on phagocytes.

Science. 1978; 200: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) were maintained at 25 °C in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen) containing 12% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. l(2)mbn cells at about 80% confluence were incubated with 20-hydroxyecdysone (Sigma) (1 μm) for 48 h. S2 cells (provided by S. Natori) were maintained at 25 °C in Schneider's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin and induced to undergo apoptosis by incubation with cycloheximide (Sigma) (1.5 μg/ml) for 24 h. Macrophages were prepared from peritoneal lavage after thioglycollate administration to mice (C57BL/6, 8-week-old females) as described previously (33Shiratsuchi A. Osada S. Kanazawa S. Nakanishi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells, a human leukemic T-cell line, were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS at 37 °C with 5% (v/v) CO2 in air and induced to undergo apoptosis by incubation with doxorubicin (Sigma) (1.5 μg/ml) for 30–40 h. The occurrence of apoptosis was monitored by examining the following changes: caspase activation detected by immunohistochemistry (see below), chromatin condensation detected by staining cells with the DNA-binding fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342, DNA breakage detected by in situ nick translation (ISNT) (see below), and PS externalization detected by determining the binding of fluorescence-labeled annexin V (34Shiratsuchi A. Umeda M. Ohba Y. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2354-2358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) or the fluorochrome PSS-380 (35Koulov A.V. Stucker K.A. Lakshmi C. Robinson J.P. Smith B.D. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 1357-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (provided by B. Smith). For the inhibition of apoptosis, S2 cells were incubated with the pancaspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (R&D Systems Inc.) at the concentrations indicated in the figures for 1 h prior to, and during, treatment with cycloheximide. Wild-type yw strain and dICAD-null flies (provided by S. Nagata), the latter of which is a P-element insertion mutant with no expression of either the inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (dICAD) or caspase-activated DNase (dCAD) (36Mukae N. Yokoyama H. Yokokura T. Sakoyama Y. Nagata S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2662-2671Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), were maintained with standard fly food and a photoperiod of 12 h dark/12 h light (lights off, 10 a.m.–10 p.m.) at 24 °C. Eggs were collected on agar plates containing grape juice and allowed to develop at 16 °C. For induction of apoptosis, embryos that had developed for 4 h at 24 °C after egg laying were exposed to x-rays (4,000 rads) and incubated for 1 h at 24 °C before analysis as described previously (30Abrams J.M. White K. Fessler L.I. Steller H. Development. 1993; 117: 29-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibody—Anti-Croquemort antiserum was generated by immunizing rats (Donryu, 2–4-month-old males) with a 420-amino acid region at the carboxyl end of Croquemort, which was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase, solubilized with urea, and affinity-purified. Anti-Draper rabbit antiserum, which was raised against an intracellular region of Draper (29Freeman M.R. Delrow J. Kim J. Johnson E. Doe C.Q. Neuron. 2003; 38: 567-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and rabbit antiserum to activated drICE, which was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a region specific for activated drICE (37Yoo S.J. Huh J.R. Muro I. Yu H. Wang L. Wang S.L. Feldman R.M.R. Clem R.J. Müller H.-A.J. Hay B.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), were provided by M. Freeman and B. Hay, respectively. Anti-Repo mouse mono-clonal antibody, clone 8D12, was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank. Preparation of Liposomes and Liposome Incorporation Assay—Liposomes were formed using either phosphatidylcholine (PC) only (PC liposomes) or a combination of PC and PS at a molar ratio of 7:3 (PS liposomes) as described previously (34Shiratsuchi A. Umeda M. Ohba Y. Nakanishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2354-2358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Fluorescence-labeled liposomes were prepared by including N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) in liposomes at 1% (in molar ratio) of total phospholipids. To examine the incorporation of liposomes, l(2)mbn cells maintained with serum-free Schneider's medium were incubated with rhodamine-labeled liposomes (0.2 mm) for 2 h at 25 °C and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), and the extent of incorporation was examined either by fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry. Western Blotting—To obtain protein samples for Western blotting, l(2)mbn cells were suspended in lysis buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, sonicated, and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with continuous agitation. The resulting whole-cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected. Proteins in this fraction were solubilized in SDS sample buffer (0.0625 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2.5% SDS, and 2.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol), separated by SDS-7.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% (w/v) dry skim milk, incubated with primary antibody, and washed. It was then reacted with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody, and the signals were visualized using the Immun-Star system (Bio-Rad). For the analysis of embryonic proteins, embryos were treated with 2.5% (v/v) sodium hypochlorite for dechorionation, suspended in SDS sample buffer, sonicated, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and proteins in the supernatants were analyzed as described above. Immunohistochemistry—For immunohistochemical detection of activated drICE in S2 cells, cells smeared on silane-coated glass slides were fixed with PBS containing 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 0.1% (w/v) glutaraldehyde and subsequently permeabilized by treatment with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The cells were then incubated with PBS containing 3% BSA, washed with PBS, and reacted with anti-activated drICE antibody. They were washed, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody, enclosed with 50% (v/v) glycerol, and examined by fluorescence/phase-contrast microscopy. To detect Croquemort in l(2)mbn cells, smeared cells were successively treated with 4% PFA-containing PBS, methanol (-20 °C), and 5% (v/v) swine serum in PBS and washed with 0.1% BSA in PBS. The cells were then reacted with anti-Croquemort antibody, washed with 0.1% BSA in PBS, and incubated successively with biotin-labeled anti-rat IgG antibody and FITC-conjugated avidin. The cells were washed with 0.1% BSA in PBS, enclosed with 50% glycerol, and examined under a fluorescence/phase-contrast microscope. To detect Draper in l(2)mbn cells, smeared cells were successively treated with a mixture of methanol and acetone (1:1 in volume) (-20 °C) and 3% BSA in PBS. The cells were then reacted with anti-Draper antibody, washed with 0.1% BSA in PBS, and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. The samples were enclosed with 50% glycerol and examined by microscopy. For detection of activated drICE in Drosophila embryos, dechorionated embryos were incubated with a mixture (1:1) of 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde-containing PBS and heptane for 30 min for fixation and then vortexed successively with methanol and heptane to remove vitellin membranes. They were then washed with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20-containing PBS, permeabilized by treatment with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 0.3% sodium deoxycholate for 30 min, and incubated for 1 h with PBS containing 5% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20 for blocking. The samples were then incubated with PBS containing 5% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20, and anti-activated drICE antibody overnight at 4 °C. The embryos were washed with 0.1% Tween 20-containing PBS, treated with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody, enclosed with 50% glycerol, and examined by fluorescence microscopy. In Situ Nick Translation—To analyze S2 cells for the presence of nuclei containing fragmented DNA, the cells were smeared on silane-coated glass slides, fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized with methanol, and washed with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100. They were then subjected to in situ DNA synthesis in the presence of tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated dUTP, DNA polymerase I (150 units/ml), and other nucleotides and reagents for 40–90 min at room temperature. The samples were washed with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100, enclosed with 50% glycerol, and examined under a fluorescence microscope. For the analysis of dispersed embryonic cells, embryos (200–1,000) were suspended with PBS and hand-crushed through a mesh using a rubber pestle, and the resulting suspension was centrifuged. The sedimented materials were resuspended with PBS, treated successively with 0.25% (w/v) collagenase and 0.25% (w/v) trypsin and then with FBS to terminate the action of proteases, and filtered through a 70-μm mesh. The resulting dispersed cells were pelleted by centrifugation, suspended with PBS, and used for further analyses. Dispersed embryonic cells were analyzed by ISNT as for S2 cells, except that the samples were incubated with Hoechst 33342 before enclosing, and fluorescence signals derived from tetramethylrhodamine and Hoechst 33342 were individually detected. For the analysis of whole embryos, dechorionated embryos were incubated with a mixture (1:1) of 4% PFA-containing PBS and heptane for 30 min for fixation and vortexed successively with methanol and heptane to remove vitellin membranes. They were further treated with heptane, washed with methanol, and incubated in PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100. The embryos were then subjected to in situ DNA synthesis, washed, and microscopically examined as done for S2 cells. In Vitro Phagocytosis Assay—l(2)mbn cells (2.5 × 105) seeded on coverslips in 24-well culture plates were incubated with Shields and Sang M3 medium (Sigma) containing 1% heat-inactivated FBS for 2 h at 25 °C, washed three times with serum-free Shields and Sang M3 medium, and mixed with S2 cells or Jurkat cells (2.5 × 106), which had been surface-labeled with biotin (sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-LC-Biotin; Pierce), in serum-free Shields and Sang M3 medium. The mixture was incubated at 25 °C for the periods indicated in the figures, washed with PBS, and successively treated with PBS containing 2% PFA, 0.1% glutaraldehyde, and 0.05% Triton X-100, methanol, and FITC-labeled avidin. The samples were examined by fluorescence/phase-contrast microscopy, and the number of l(2)mbn cells that incorporated fluorescent target cells was determined and expressed relative to the total number of l(2)mbn cells (in percentage; the phagocytic index). To examine the phagocytosis of latex beads or zymosan particles, l(2)mbn cells treated or not treated with 20-hydroxyecdysone were incubated with the targets, FITC-labeled latex beads (Fluoresbrite Carboxylate Microspheres; diameter = 1.58 μm; Polysciences, Warrington, PA) (phagocyte/target ratio 1:30) or 5-carboxyfluorescein-labeled zymosan (zymosan A; Sigma) (phagocyte/target ratio 1:5), for the periods indicated in the figures, washed with PBS, fixed as described above, and examined by fluorescence microscopy. The extent of phagocytosis was determined as done for the assay with cultured cells as targets. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated with unlabeled or biotinylated S2 cells (macrophages/targets ratio 1:10–20), which had been induced to undergo apoptosis by treatment with cycloheximide as described above, in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of liposomes. In reactions using unlabeled target cells, the samples were washed, fixed, and stained with hematoxylin, and the extent of phagocytosis was determined by phase-contrast microscopy. In reactions using biotinylated S2 cells as targets, the extent of phagocytosis was determined as done for the reaction using l(2)mbn cells as phagocytes. In Vivo Phagocytosis Assay—Phagocytosis of apoptotic cells in whole embryos was examined by analyzing embryos of dICAD mutant flies (at about 24 h of development at 16 °C) by ISNT as described above. For examination of the involvement of Draper in phagocytosis, embryos of dICAD mutant flies were subjected to RNA interference using double-stranded RNA containing the Draper mRNA sequence as described below and allowed to develop for 23.5 h at 16 °C. The embryos together with embryos injected with solvent alone were dechorionated as described above and incubated with a mixture (1:1) of 37% formaldehyde-containing PBS and heptane for 20 min for fixation. They were placed on double-sticky tapes, and vitellin membranes were removed manually using needles. The samples were washed with methanol and subjected to ISNT as described above, except that a 10-min treatment with proteinase K (10 μg/ml) was included prior to DNA synthesis reactions. ISNT signals present in a whole single embryo were detected and enumerated under a fluorescence microscope by gradually changing focal planes. Twenty embryos in a group of each experiment were analyzed in this way, and means and S.D. values of the number of ISNT-positive signals were obtained. Phagocytosis in embryos was also examined by histochemical examination of dispersed embryonic cells from wild-type flies. For this purpose, embryonic cells were simultaneously analyzed by ISNT and immunofluorescence using antibody recognizing phagocyte markers, and the ratio of phagocytes that had engulfed apoptotic cells was determined. Embryonic cells were dispersed as described above, washed with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA, and incubated with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA, and 10% FBS for blocking. The cells were then incubated with anti-Croquemort (a marker of hemocytes/macrophages) or anti-Repo (a marker of glia) antibody in the same solution used for blocking. The samples were washed with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 0.1% BSA and incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rat IgG (for detection of Croquemort) or FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (for detection of Repo). The cells were then subjected to in situ DNA synthesis, washed, stained with Hoechst 33342, and microscopically examined as described above. About 4,000 cells in three different microscopic fields were examined for the positivity in immunofluorescence and ISNT. The number of Croquemort- or Repo-expressing cells that contained ISNT-positive nuclei was determined and expressed relative (in percentage) to total Croquemort- or Repo-expressing cells as the phagocytic index. RNA Interference—DNA corresponding to the region between nucleotide positions 495 and 1,294 (with the transcription start site numbered 1) of croquemort or the region between 1,322 and 2,463 of draper was generated by polymerase chain reaction using the Croquemort (27Franc N.C.

Franc) or Draper (clone GH03529; obtained from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project) cDNA as a template. The amplified DNAs were then used as templates for preparation of RNA from both strands using a commercial kit (T7 RiboMAX Express Large Scale RNA Production System; Promega Corp., Madison, WI). The synthesized RNA was purified by gel filtration and allowed to form double strands, and the samples were used in further experiments after the formation of double strands was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. l(2)mbn cells that had been maintained as described above were washed with serum- and antibiotic-free Schneider's medium, suspended in the same medium containing the double-stranded RNA (50 μg/ml) and incubated for 30 min. The cultures were then supplemented with 2 volumes of Schneider's medium containing 12% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and fu"

https://openalex.org/W2084223479,"The view that autosomal gene expression is controlled exclusively by protein trans-acting factors has been challenged recently by the identification of RNA molecules that regulate chromatin. In the majority of cases where RNA molecules are implicated in DNA control, the molecular mechanisms are unknown, in large part because the RNA·protein complexes are uncharacterized. Here, we identify a novel set of RNA-binding proteins that are well known for their function in chromatin regulation. The RNA-interacting proteins are components of the mammalian DNA methylation system. Genomic methylation controls chromatin in the context of transposon silencing, imprinting, and X chromosome dosage compensation. DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) catalyze methylation of cytosines in CGs. The methyl-CGs are recognized by methyl-DNA-binding domain (MBD) proteins, which recruit histone deacetylases and chromatin remodeling proteins to effect silencing. We show that a subset of the DNMTs and MBD proteins can form RNA·protein complexes. We characterize the MBD protein RNA-binding activity and show that it is distinct from the methyl-CG-binding domain and mediates a high affinity interaction with RNA. The RNA and methyl-CG binding properties of the MBD proteins are mutually exclusive. We speculate that DNMTs and MBD proteins allow RNA molecules to participate in DNA methylation-mediated chromatin control.

Five DNMTs have been described: DNMT1, DNMT2, DNMT3a, DNMT3b, and DNMT3L. All have a conserved catalytic domain, but no enzyme activity has yet been detected for DNMT2 and DNMT3L. Genetic analyses of DNMTs have amply demonstrated the relevance of CG methylation for genome function. Disruption of DNMT1 in the mouse results in embryonic lethality (5Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar). Analysis of these embryos showed that DNA methylation is essential for proper imprinting (6Li E. Beard C.

Mice lacking DNMT3a die prematurely, and embryos without DNMT3b do not develop to term (11Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4574) Google Scholar). Conditional removal of DNMT3a in germ cells revealed that it is essential for imprinting (12Kaneda M. Okano M. Hata K. Sado T. Tsujimoto N. Li E. Sasaki H. Nature. 2004; 429: 900-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). DNMT3L is also necessary for imprinting (13Hata K. Okano M. Lei H. Li E. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 1983-1993PubMed Google Scholar, 14Bourc'his D. Xu G.L. Lin C.S. Bollman B. Bestor T.H. Science. 2001; 294: 2536-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar). CG methylation is therefore essential for, rather than consequential to, silenced chromatin. Because CG methylation is heritable, it can be properly described as an epigenetic modification. Regions of the genome that are under the control of DNA methylation and the molecular basis of methylation-mediated silencing have been extensively studied. Although a precise map of methyl-CG distribution in any genome is not yet available, some patterns are apparent (3Meehan R.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 14: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 15Jaenisch R. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (4739) Google Scholar). Methylation is dynamic in a developing mammal: shortly after fertilization, the male genome is actively demethylated by as yet to be identified demethylase(s) (16Oswald J. Engemann S. Lane N. Mayer W. Olek A. Fundele R. Dean W. Reik W. Walter J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 475-478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 17Mayer W. Niveleau A. Walter J. Fundele R. Haaf T. Nature. 2000; 403: 501-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar), and the female genome is passively demethylated. The embryonic genome then undergoes de novo methylation during implantation and can lose methylation again during differentiation of some tissues (18Reik W. Dean W. Walter J. Science. 2001; 293: 1089-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (2457) Google Scholar). In the adult, ∼80% of CGs are stably methylated. Coding region, intronic, and extragenic CGs are generally methylated. Promoter region CGs are generally undermethylated, except at imprinted alleles and on the inactive X chromosome (2Bird A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5486) Google Scholar). How CGs are chosen for, or spared from, DNMT and demethylase attention is not known, although members of the SNF2 helicase family that disrupt DNA/histone contacts are implicated (3Meehan R.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 14: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that translate methyl-CGs into silenced chromatin are several and not fully understood. Some methyl-CGs block DNA·protein interactions, whereas others are attractive. The methyl-CG-binding domain (MBD) family is the best characterized set of proteins that are attracted to methyl-CGs (see Fig. 1) (19Lewis J.D. Meehan R.R. Henzel W.J. Maurer-Fogy I. Jeppesen P.

Outside the MBD, these proteins generally share little sequence similarity, but several members of the family appear to use a similar core mechanism to silence chromatin. They recruit histone deacetylases and proteins with homology to ATP-dependent helicases, enzymes that can create a chromatin structure inhospitable to RNA polymerases (22Feng Q. Zhang Y.

A functionally homologous region in the MBD proteins, the transcription repression domain, is essential for nucleating these histone deacetylases at methyl-CGs (see Fig. 1). It has been suggested that MBD proteins can silence chromatin by mechanisms other than histone deacetylase recruitment based on observations that histone deacetylase inhibitors do not totally reverse DNA methylation-mediated or MBD protein-mediated transcription inhibition (23Jones P.L.

Meehan and co-workers (49Stancheva I. Collins A.L. Van den Veyver I.B. Zoghbi H. Meehan R.R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 425-435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) reported that the Xenopus Hairy2a gene, the protein product of which is an inhibitor of neuronal cell differentiation, is repressed by MeCP2 in this animal, while in cultured mammalian neurons, MeCP2 represses the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene, the product of which functions in neuronal cell development and plasticity. MeCP2-mediated repression is overcome by membrane depolarization (50Chen W.G. Chang Q. Lin Y. Meissner A. West A.E. Griffith E.C. Jaenisch R. Greenberg M.E.

Exactly how control of these two genes translates to neuronal cell function and dysfunction when MeCP2 is mutated is not clear. To explain how specific genes are repressed by any one MBD family member, the observation that each MBD protein tends to be concentrated at sites of constitutive heterochromatin needs to be incorporated (20Hendrich B.

Interestingly, factors that dictate specificity of methyl-CG·MBD interactions are not known, although there is some evidence that the density of methyl-CGs and DNA sequence context surrounding methyl-CGs may be relevant (20Hendrich B.

Noncoding RNA molecules function in several epigenetic chromatin controls that also use DNA methylation, e.g. X chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting and silencing of repetitive DNA elements (15Jaenisch R. Bird A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (4739) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which RNA molecules influence any of these processes are not understood. Here, we show that specific MBD proteins and DNMTs are able to form RNA·protein (RNP) complexes. The RNA·MBD protein and methyl-DNA·MBD protein complexes are mutually exclusive. Our observations indicate a new molecular aspect to MBD and DNMT protein function. Plasmids for Protein Expression in Bacteria—Plasmid encoding GST-MBD2(FL)-His was made by Pwo PCR amplification of full-length (FL) mouse MBD2 using a 5′-primer containing an EcoRI site and a 3′-primer containing a SalI site. Following restriction enzyme digestion, the PCR product was inserted into EcoRI/SalI-digested pET-GST-II (56Nakielny S. Shaikh S. Burke B. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1982-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). DNAs encoding GST-MBD1(FL)-His, GST-MBD2 (deletion mutants), GST-MeCP2 (full-length and deletion mutants), and His-MBD3(FL) were kindly provided by Dr. Adrian Bird (University of Edinburgh).

Plasmids encoding GST-DNMT1-N, GST-DNMT1-M, and GST-DNMT1-C were made by Pwo PCR using primers containing attB sites. The PCR template was mouse Dnmt1 cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. En Li, Harvard Medical School). DNMT1-N is aa 1–300; DNMT1-M is aa 300–1000; and DNMT1-C is aa 1000–1620. These were cloned into pDEST-GST via pDONR-221 (Invitrogen). DNA encoding GST-DNMT2 was made by Pwo PCR using primers containing attB sites from a 3T3 cell library and cloned into pDEST-GST via pDONR-221. DNAs encoding GST-DNMT3a and GST-DNMT3b1 (mouse) were provided by Dr. Shoji Tajima (Osaka University). Plasmids for Protein Expression in Mammalian Cells—Mammalian FLAG Gateway expression vector (pcDNA3.1-FLAG-DEST) was made using EcoRI/BamHI-cut and blunt-ended pcDNA3.1-FLAG DNA, which was ligated to a blunt-ended cassette containing attR sites (Invitrogen). DNAs encoding full-length mouse MBD2, the mouse MBD2 MBD (aa 148–221), and rat MeCP2, for cloning in the Gateway system, were made by Pwo PCR using primers containing attB sites. These were cloned into pDONR-221. Deletion of the MBD2 RG domain (aa 48–114) and the MeCP2 (rat) RG domain (aa 160–200) was achieved using a QuikChange mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). All pDONR-221 clones were then cloned into pcDNA3.1-FLAG-DEST. DNA encoding FLAG-MeCP2 (human) was made by Pwo PCR amplification of IMAGE clone 3956518 using primers containing attB sites and cloned into pDONR-221.

FLAG-DNMT3L was made by Pwo PCR amplification of IMAGE clone 3138514 using primers containing attB sites and cloned into pcDNA3.1-FLAG-DEST via pDONR-221. Recombinant Proteins Expressed in Bacteria—All proteins were overexpressed in BL21(DE3) cells with the exception of GST-MeCP2(FL), which was expressed in BL21(DE3) Codon Plus cells; GST-MBD2(FL)-His, which was expressed in BL21(DE3) pLysS cells; and GST-DNMT1-M, which was expressed in Tuner(DE3) cells. Protein expression was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (pGEX vectors) or 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (pET vectors) for 4 h at 37 °C. All protein purification steps were carried out on ice at 4 °C. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in the buffers indicated below, containing 10 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin; 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and 0.1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride for nickel resin purifications or 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) for glutathione resin purifications. Thereafter, all buffers contained 1 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin; 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and 0.1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride or 1 mm DTT. GST-MBD1(FL)-His was purified on nickel resin, and GST-MBD2(FL)-His and GST-MeCP2(FL) were purified on glutathione resin followed by nickel resin. The MeCP2 protein itself contains an internal stretch of histidines. Single-tag recombinant proteins were purified on glutathione (GST-MBD2 and GST-MeCP2 deletion mutants) or nickel (His-MBD3) resin. Pellets of bacteria expressing GST fusion proteins were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), except for DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b1, which were resuspended in PBS, 0.33 m NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100; sonicated; and centrifuged at 30,000 × g. The proteins were purified using modified glutathione elution buffer (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions, except for DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b1, which were eluted in PBS, 0.33 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 20 mm glutathione. Pellets of bacteria expressing His fusion proteins were resuspended in binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol), sonicated, and centrifuged, and the extract was loaded onto nickel resin equilibrated in binding buffer. The resin was washed with 10 column volumes of binding buffer followed by 10 column volumes of binding buffer and 15 mm imidazole. Protein was eluted in 2 column volumes of binding buffer and 500 mm imidazole. For proteins purified over glutathione and nickel resins, an equal volume of 2× binding buffer was added to the glutathione resin elution, and this was purified on nickel resin as described above. All proteins were dialyzed against PBS and 10% glycerol, except for MBD3, which was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 0.5 m KCl, and 10% glycerol; quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen; and stored at -80 °C. The protein concentration of each preparation was determined by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining by comparison with optical density-determined bovine serum albumin standard titrated alongside. The recombinant proteins that were not susceptible to proteolysis during preparation were >90% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Proteins that suffered proteolysis in the bacteria or during purification showed additional bands on the gel smaller than that of the full-length protein. We confirmed that these bands were derived from the intact protein by Western blotting with anti-GST or anti-His tag antibody. Recombinant Proteins Expressed in Mammalian Cells—293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged proteins (6 μgof plasmid and 60 μl of Effectene (QIAGEN Inc.) transfection reagent/100-mm plate. All subsequent steps were done on ice at 4 °C, and all buffers contained 2 μg/ml each leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin; 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and 1 mm DTT. Cells were washed once with PBS; lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 800 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Triton X-100 (2× 0.5 ml/100-mm plate); sonicated; and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was added to anti-FLAG antibody M2-agarose beads (Sigma; 25-μl bead volume/plate of cells, washed with lysis buffer), and the volume was brought to 0.8 ml with lysis buffer. The slurry was rotated for 1 h, and beads were washed five times with lysis buffer before eluting the FLAG-tagged proteins in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.4 mg/ml 3X FLAG® peptide (Sigma) for 1 h rotating. The eluate was collected by passing the slurry through a Micro Bio-Spin column (Bio-Rad). Proteins were dialyzed into PBS and 10% glycerol, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined as described for recombinant proteins expressed in bacteria. All FLAG-tagged proteins were >90% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. RNA Probes—The plasmids used for production of 32P-labeled mRNA, U1 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), and tRNA were kindly provided by Dr. Naoyuki Kataoka (Kyoto University) and that for production of 5 S rRNA by Dr. Maarten Fornerod (Netherlands Cancer Institute). The mRNA (mouse immunoglobulin gene, coding exons C3 and C4 of the constant region of the IgM heavy chain) has 271 nucleotides; U1 snRNA (Xenopus) has 164 nucleotides;(tRNAiMet)(human) has 78 nucleotides; and 5 S rRNA (Xenopus) has 121 nucleotides. Plasmid DNA encoding each RNA was linearized with an appropriate restriction enzyme and in vitro transcribed with T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase (Promega), [α-32P]UTP, and [α-32P]GTP according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reactions were treated with DNase for 15 min at 37 °C. mRNA was purified using a G-50 spin column. U1 snRNA, tRNA, and 5 S rRNA were purified on a urea-5% polyacrylamide gel. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) probe is a 21-mer of chemically synthesized annealed sense and antisense nucleotides corresponding to nucleotides 2297–2315 of human NUP153 mRNA. Each strand has a 3′-dTT single-strand overhang. The siRNA probe was 5′-end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.) and [γ-32P]ATP according to the manufacturer's instructions. All radiolabeled RNAs were quantified by absorbance at 260 nm and ethidium bromide staining. DNA Probes—Methyl-dsDNA has 40 bp (GAM12) and contains 12 methyl-CGs (19Lewis J.D. Meehan R.R. Henzel W.J.

The DNA was 5′-end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP according to the manufacturer's instructions. Radiolabeled methyl-dsDNA was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm and ethidium bromide staining. Nucleic Acid·Protein Binding Assay—All reactions were performed in band-shift buffer (40 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 110 mm KOAc, 6 mm MgOAc, and 250 mm sucrose) plus 1 mm DTT and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. RNA·protein binding assays contained 20 units of RNasin. Incubations with radiolabeled methyl-dsDNA included 0.1 mg/ml tRNA. In Fig. 4, the band-shift buffer included 0.2 mg/ml yeast tRNA and did not contain DTT or Nonidet P-40. In Fig. 8B, the band-shift buffer included 0.1 mg/ml yeast tRNA for the DNMT1 incubations. Reactions were incubated on ice for 20 min and analyzed by native 4 or 5% polyacrylamide (19:1 or 79:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) or 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Gels were run in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA at 4 °C (polyacrylamide, 2 h at 200 V; and agarose, 90 min at 130 V), dried, and autoradiographed.Fig. 8A, the DNMT protein family. The five DNMT genes have a conserved catalytic domain (green). The cysteine-rich domain (CXXCXXC), the BAH (bromo-adjacent homology) domain, the PWWP (Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro) domain, and the PHD/CXXC (plant homeodomain-like) zinc finger domain are indicated. B, a subset of the DNMT protein family forms RNP complexes. Recombinant GST-DNMT proteins were expressed in and purified from bacteria. DNMT1-N, DNMT1-M, and DNMT1-C are aa 1–300, aa 300–1000, and aa 1000–1620, respectively. Radiolabeled RNA (5 nm) was incubated with the purified proteins for 20 min on ice.

https://openalex.org/W1986168751,"Rap2 belongs to the Ras family of small GTP-binding proteins, but its specific roles in cell signaling remain unknown. In the present study, we have affinity-purified from rat brain a Rap2-interacting protein of ∼155 kDa, p155. By liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we have identified p155 as Traf2- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK). TNIK possesses an N-terminal kinase domain homologous to STE20, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase, and a C-terminal regulatory domain termed the citron homology (CNH) domain. TNIK induces disruption of F-actin structure, thereby inhibiting cell spreading. In addition, TNIK specifically activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. Among our observations, TNIK interacted with Rap2 through its CNH domain but did not interact with Rap1 or Ras. TNIK interaction with Rap2 was dependent on the intact effector region and GTP-bound configuration of Rap2. When co-expressed in cultured cells, TNIK colocalized with Rap2, while a mutant TNIK lacking the CNH domain did not. Rap2 potently enhanced the inhibitory function of TNIK against cell spreading, but this was not observed for the mutant TNIK lacking the CNH domain. Rap2 did not significantly enhance TNIK-induced JNK activation, but promoted autophosphorylation and translocation of TNIK to the detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction. These results suggest that TNIK is a specific effector of Rap2 to regulate actin cytoskeleton.

Rap2 is a member of the Ras family of small GTP-binding proteins, which regulate a range of cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and cytoskeletal rearrangement (for a review, see Ref. 1Bos J.L.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: M19-M31Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 2Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). During interaction with effectors, the effector regions of Ras family proteins (amino acids 32–40 in the case of Ras) serve as binding interfaces; thus, mutations within their effector regions impair interaction with effectors (Refs. 1Bos J.L.

Sci. 1993; 18: 250-254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The effector regions are also critical for the differential recognition of effectors. For instance, the effector region of Rap1, a close relative of Rap2, is identical to that of Ras. Rap1 interacts with effectors of Ras, and sometimes counteracts Ras-mediated signaling (1Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: M19-M31Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 2Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). For example, Rap1 regulates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, the “classical” mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, through Raf-1 and B-raf. Although Rap1 interacts with Raf-1 and B-raf, it only activates B-raf. In fibroblasts, Rap1 inhibits Ras-induced cellular transformation. Rap1 exerts this action presumably by trapping Raf-1 in an inactive complex, thereby inhibiting ERK activation (1Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: M19-M31Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 2Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J.

In PC12 cells, Rap1 mediates the sustained activation of ERK induced by nerve growth factor through the activation of B-raf (8York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McClesky E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). However, Rap1 does not have a specific effector that does not interact with Ras. On the other hand, the effector region of Ral, another Ras family protein, differs from that of Ras by three amino acids. Unlike Rap1, Ral has a specific effector, Ral-binding protein 1, which does not possess RBD or RAD and does not interact with Ras (1Bos J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: M19-M31Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 2Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Rap2 has been thought to be functionally analogous to Rap1. In fact, Rap2 interacts with effectors of Ras and sometimes counteracts Ras-mediated signaling, as does Rap1. Rap2 interacts with Raf-1 in HEK293T cells and inhibits the Ras-dependent activation of the transcription factor Elk1, a direct down-stream target of ERK (9Ohba Y. Mochizuki N. Matsuo K. Yamashita S. Nakaya M. Hashimoto Y. Hamaguchi M. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6074-6083Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Rap2 also interacts with RalGDS in COS7 cells, but this does not lead to the activation of Ral, the downstream target of RalGDS (10Nancy V. Wolthuis R.M. de Tand M.-F. Janoueix-Lerosey I. Bos J.L. de Gunzburg J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8737-8745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Further, Rap2 interacts with PI3K in the B cell lymphoma cell line A20, and inhibits the activation of Akt, the downstream target of PI3K (11Christian S.L. Lee R.L. McLeod S.J. Burgess A.E. Li A.H.

However, contrary to these observations, Rap2 fails to suppress Ras-induced cellular transformation (12Jimenez B. Pizon V. Lerosey I. Beranger F. Tavitian A. de Gunzburg J. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 49: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), while it suppresses v-Src-induced transformation (9Ohba Y. Mochizuki N. Matsuo K. Yamashita S. Nakaya M. Hashimoto Y.

Furthermore, Rap2 is activated by GDP/GTP exchange factors (GEFs) differently from Rap1 (9Ohba Y. Mochizuki N. Matsuo K. Yamashita S. Nakaya M. Hashimoto Y. Hamaguchi M. Kurata T. Nagashima K.

Furthermore, the GEF domain of PLCϵ acts on Rap1 but not on Rap2 (23Jin T.-G. Satoh T. Liao Y. Song C. Gao X. Kariya K. Hu C.-D. Kataoka T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30301-30307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that Rap2 is not functionally analogous to Rap1, and that Rap2 and Rap1 perform overlapping but distinct signaling functions. We hypothesized that Rap2 performs its specific signaling functions by regulating specific effectors. In support of this, the effector region of Rap2 differs from those of Ras or Rap1 by a single amino acid. Amino acid 39 in Rap2 is Phe, while in Ras and Rap1 it is Ser. This may confer on Rap2 the ability to interact with specific effectors and play signaling roles distinct from those of Ras and Rap1. In fact, Rap2 interacts with a specific effector candidate, Rap2-interacting protein 8, which does not interact with Ras or Rap1 (24Janoueix-Lerosey I. Pasheva E. de Tand M.-F. Tavitian A. de Gunzburg J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, no signaling function for this protein is known. In the present study, we attempted to affinity-purify a specific effector(s) of Rap2 from rat brain. We searched for proteins that interact with a Rap2 affinity column but not with a Ras affinity column. We found one such protein of ∼155 kDa. By liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), we identified this protein, designated p155, as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 2 (Traf2)- and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) (25Fu C.A. Shen M. Huang B.C. Lasaga J. Payan D.G. Luo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30729-30737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). TNIK was isolated by yeast two-hybrid screening for proteins that interact with Traf2 and Nck (25Fu C.A. Shen M. Huang B.C. Lasaga J. Payan D.G. Luo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30729-30737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Traf2 belongs to a family of adaptor proteins that shares a common structural domain, the Traf domain. Traf2 is implicated in the regulation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a “stress-activated” MAPK, and the transcription factor NF-κB by TNF receptor or related receptors (for a review, see Ref. 26Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6482-6491Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Nck belongs to a family of adaptor proteins containing the Src homology (SH)2/SH3 domains. Nck is implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by receptor or non-receptor tyrosine kinases (for a review, see Ref. 27Buday L. Wunderlich L. Tamas P. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). TNIK does not possess RBD or RAD. TNIK consists of an N-terminal kinase domain, a C-terminal regulatory domain termed the citron homology (CNH) domain, and an intervening region between these domains. The CNH domain was named after citron kinase (28Madaule P. Furuyashiki T. Reid T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Morii N. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), an effector of the Rho family small GTP-binding proteins Rho and Rac, where it was first described. The kinase domain of TNIK is structurally related to that of STE20, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae MAPK kinase kinase kinase (MAP4K), and thus TNIK belongs to the STE20 group of protein kinases, which share similar kinase domains (for a review, see Ref 29Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The STE20 group includes the p21-activated kinase (PAK) family, which possesses a C-terminal kinase domain (for a review, see Ref 30Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), and the germinal center kinase (GCK) family, which possesses an N-terminal kinase domain (for a review, see Ref. 31Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Several PAK family members serve as effectors of the Rho family small GTP-binding proteins Cdc42 and Rac and regulate JNK and the actin cytoskeleton (30Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 350-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). TNIK belongs to the GCK family (29Dan I. Watanabe N.M. Kusumi A. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 220-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar), and exhibits two mutually independent functions (25Fu C.A. Shen M. Huang B.C. Lasaga J. Payan D.G. Luo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30729-30737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Like several other GCK family members, TNIK regulates JNK. For this function, its CNH domain is necessary and sufficient. TNIK does not activate other MAPKs such as p38, or ERK. TNIK does not activate NF-κB, either. Unlike other GCK family members, TNIK also regulates the actin cytoskeleton. TNIK induces actin fiber disassembly and consequently reverses pre-established cell spreading: with the expression of TNIK, well adherent and spread cells round up and finally lose attachment to culture dishes. However, these cells are viable and are not undergoing apoptosis (25Fu C.A. Shen M. Huang B.C. Lasaga J. Payan D.G. Luo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30729-30737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). For this function, its kinase domain is necessary and sufficient. TNIK phosphorylates gelsolin, an F-actin fragmenting and capping enzyme, in vitro, although it is unknown whether phosphorylation takes place and influences gelsolin functions within cells (25Fu C.A. Shen M. Huang B.C. Lasaga J. Payan D.G. Luo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30729-30737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that TNIK interacts with Rap2 but not with Rap1 or Ras. The interaction requires GTP-bound configuration of Rap2 and the intact effector region of Rap2. TNIK co-localizes with Rap2 when co-expressed in cells. Rap2 potently enhances TNIK-induced loss of cell spreading. Furthermore, Rap2 promotes the autophosphorylation and translocation of TNIK to the detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction. These observations suggest that TNIK serves as a specific effector of Rap2 to regulate actin cytoskeleton.

After washing the columns with 2 ml of buffer A, bound proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 10 mm glutathione. The eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. A gel piece containing p155 was excised, and the proteins were in-gel digested with trypsin. The resultant peptides were analyzed using an LC-MS/MS system (LCQ DecaXP, ThermoQuest Inc., San Jose, CA), and the data were used to search against the NCBI data base with MASCOT software (Matrix Science, Ltd., London, UK) for protein identification.

TNIK and its C-terminal deletion mutant TNIKΔCNH (amino acids 1–1041) lacking the CNH domain were expressed in HEK293T cells with the HA epitope tag. To this end, the HA coding sequence was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pCIneo (Promega) to yield pCIneo-HA. From the clone KIAA0551, the TNIK and TNIKΔCNH coding sequences were amplified by PCR and inserted into pCIneo-HA to yield pCIneo-HA-TNIK and -TNIKΔCNH, respectively. 293T cells were then transfected with pCIneo-HA-TNIK or pCIneo-HA-TNIKΔCNH using Polyfect reagent (Qiagen) and harvested at 24-h post-transfection.

https://openalex.org/W2036187082,"Glucose oxidase (GOX; β-d-glucose:oxygen oxidoreductase) from Aspergillus niger is a dimeric flavoprotein with a molecular mass of 80 kDa/monomer. Thermal denaturation of glucose oxidase has been studied by absorbance, circular dichroism spectroscopy, viscosimetry, and differential scanning calorimetry. Thermal transition of this homodimeric enzyme is irreversible and, surprisingly, independent of GOX concentration (0.2–5.1 mg/ml). It has an apparent transition temperature of 55.8 ± 1.2 °C and an activation energy of ∼280 kJ/mol, calculated from the Lumry-Eyring model. The thermally denatured state of GOX after recooling has the following characteristics. (i) It retains ∼70% of the native secondary structure ellipticity; (ii) it has a relatively low intrinsic viscosity, 7.5 ml/g; (iii) it binds ANS; (iv) it has a low Stern-Volmer constant of tryptophan quenching; and (v) it forms defined oligomeric (dimers, trimers, tetramers) structures. It is significantly different from chemically denatured (6.67 m GdmHCl) GOX. Both the thermal and the chemical denaturation of GOX cause dissociation of the flavin cofactor; however, only the chemical denaturation is accompanied by dissociation of the homodimeric GOX into monomers. The transition temperature is independent of the protein concentration, and the properties of the thermally denatured protein indicate that thermally denatured GOX is a compact structure, a form of molten globule-like apoenzyme. GOX is thus an exceptional example of a relatively unstable mesophilic dimeric enzyme with residual structure in its thermally denatured state. Glucose oxidase (GOX; β-d-glucose:oxygen oxidoreductase) from Aspergillus niger is a dimeric flavoprotein with a molecular mass of 80 kDa/monomer.

Glucose oxidase (GOX 1The abbreviations used are: GOX, glucose oxidase; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; ANS, 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate; Gdm-HCl, guanidinium hydrochloride.1The abbreviations used are: GOX, glucose oxidase; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; ANS, 8-anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate; Gdm-HCl, guanidinium hydrochloride.; β-d-glucose:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.3.4) is a flavoenzyme that catalyzes oxidation of β-d-glucose by molecular oxygen to δ-gluconolactone, which subsequently hydrolyzes spontaneously to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. The enzyme contains one tightly, noncovalently bound FAD cofactor per monomer and is a homodimer with a molecular mass of 160 kDa, depending on the extent of glycosylation (1Hecht H.J. Kalisz H.M. Hendle J. Schmid R.D. Schomburg D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 153-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger is glycosylated by neutral sugars (mostly mannose-like sugars) and by amino sugars (2Tsuge H. Natsuaki O. Ohashi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1975; 78: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Several reports find that the sugar content may vary from 11 up to 30% (3Swoboda B.E.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2209-2215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Nakamura S. Hayashi S. FEBS Lett. 1974; 41: 327-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 5Kalisz H.M. Hecht H.J. Schomburg D. Schmid R.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1080: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). GOX is of considerable commercial importance. The enzyme has applications in the food and fermentation industry, in the textile industry, and as a molecular diagnostic and analytical tool in medical and environmental monitoring applications (6Röhr M. Kubicek C.P. Kominek J. Rehm H.J. Reed G. Biotechnology. 3. Verlag Chemie Weiheim, Munich, Germany1983: 455-456Google Scholar, 7Frew J.E. Hill H.A. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol.

Yoshimoto M. Fukunaga K. Nakao K. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2003; 83: 444-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The study of GOX and its applications is limited by its conformational instability. A significant effort has been made to increase the stability of GOX. It is known that both the thermal stability and the dynamic properties of the enzyme depend on its redox state (11Nakamura S. Koga K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1977; 78: 806-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 12Haouz A. Twist C. Zentz C. Tanc P. Alpert B. Eur. Biophys. J. 1998; 27: 19-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Protein glycosylation affects the conformational dynamics of the active site and thus the activity of the enzyme (13Kohen A. Jonsson T. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2603-2611Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, the way in which glycosylation affects the stability of GOX is not known. On the other hand, modification of the glucose oxidase surface by artificial long polyethylene-glycol chains results in an increased melting temperature (14Seymour S.L. Klinman J.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8747-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Externally added polyols like sorbitol or glycerol significantly increased the melting temperature of glucose oxidase (15Cioci F. Lavecchia R. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1994; 34: 705-712PubMed Google Scholar). The activity and conformational stability have also been studied in the immobilized state (16Rao V.B. Sastri N.V.S. Rao P.V.S. Biochem. J. 1981; 193: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 17Gouda M.D. Kumar M.A. Thakur M.S. Karanth N.G. Biosens. Bioelectron. 2002; 17: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), in the cross-linked state (18Solomon B. Biopolymers. 1977; 16: 1837-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and in the presence of different additives such as mono- and divalent salts and lysozyme (19Ahmad A. Akhtar M.S. Bhakuni V. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1945-1955Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 20Akhtar M.S. Ahmad A. Bhakuni V.

Despite the progress in understanding the thermal denaturation/inactivation of GOX, the mechanism of the irreversible thermally induced denaturation is not clear. Moreover, there are inconsistencies in the reported basic thermodynamic parameters (e.g. the apparent transition temperature of the thermal denaturation of GOX). In the present work, we have analyzed the thermal denaturation of GOX using a kinetic model of denaturation proposed by Lumry and Eyring (22Lumry R. Eyring H. J. Phys. Chem. 1954; 58: 110-120Crossref Scopus (719) Google Scholar, 23Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 921-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Obtained results enable us to (i) characterize the thermally denatured state, (ii) suggest a modified mechanism of thermal denaturation, and (iii) indicate a possible source of inconsistencies in the reported values that characterize the thermal transition of glucose oxidase. Materials—Chemicals of high purity grade were obtained from Merck, Sigma, and Lachema. Glucose oxidase was purchased from Merck and Sigma (type VII-S). Before each assay, the protein was dialyzed overnight against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, at 4 °C. The concentration of glucose oxidase was calculated using the extinction coefficient ϵ450 = 28,200 m–1 cm–1 (3Swoboda B.E.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2209-2215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue showed a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 80 kDa. The concentrations of guanidinium hydrochloride were determined from refractive index measurements using an Abbe Refractometer AR3-AR6 (24Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). The pH values of the solutions were measured with a Sensorex glass electrode. The solvent-accessible surface area (probe radius of 1.4 Å2) was calculated using Surface Racer (25Tsodikov O.V. Record Jr, M.T. Sergeev Y.V. J. Comput. Chem. 2002; 23: 600-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Circular Dichroism—CD measurements were performed on a Jasco J-810 (Tokyo, Japan) spectropolarimeter with 5–15 μm glucose oxidase at 20 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and a given concentration of GdmHCl. A cuvette with a 1-mm path length was used for the peptide region, and a 1-cm path length cuvette was used for the aromatic and visible regions. Each spectrum is the result of the averaging of 4–6 consecutive scans. The thermal transitions were recorded at 222 nm at a constant scan rate of 1 K/min and with different concentrations of enzyme. The temperature of the sample was controlled with a PTC-348 WI Peltier block. Absorbance—Spectrophotometric measurements were carried out on a Shimadzu UV-3000 spectrophotometer. The difference spectra were collected at various temperatures in different spectral regions (aromatic and visible). Changes in the absorbance at 280–320 nm are due to changes of the environments of the tryptophans and the flavin. The flavin absorbance was measured in the spectral region of 350–550 nm. The scan rate was 1 K/min, and the cuvette was heated by an external thermal bath. The temperature inside the cuvette was controlled with a digital thermometer connected to a computer. The concentration of glucose oxidase was 5–30 μm in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Fluorescence—Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Shimadzu RF 5000 and a RF 5301-PC spectrofluorophotometer. Changes in the emission spectra of the internal chromophores, Trp and FAD, were observed upon excitation at 290 and 450 nm, respectively. The protein concentration was 15 μm in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, in a final volume of 2.5 ml. Binding of the ANS probe (20 mm stock dissolved in ethanol) to the various states of glucose oxidase was measured as the change in the ANS emission spectra upon excitation at 390 nm. Fluorescence Quenching—Quenching experiments were performed with noncharged (acrylamide) and charged (CsCl, KI) quenchers. Freshly prepared stock solutions of quenchers at a 2 m concentration were prepared in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The measurements were performed with 5–10 μm protein. Quenchers were added to the cuvette in small, 5–20-μl, aliquots. The emission spectra were recorded after excitation at 290 nm (Trp) or 450 nm (FAD). Data were analyzed using the Stern-Volmer equation (1Hecht H.J. Kalisz H.M. Hendle J. Schmid R.D. Schomburg D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 153-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) assuming a single population of fluorophores (26Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar),F0F=1+Ksv[Q](Eq. 1) where KSV is the Stern-Volmer quenching constant. The Stern-Volmer plots were analyzed by linear regression using computer software Grafit version 3.00. The Stern-Volmer quenching constants were obtained from the linear regression analysis of the experimental data (10–15 points) for various quencher concentrations. The coefficient of linearity, r > 0.98 for FAD and r > 0.96 for tryptophans, was an additional criterion confirming a single fluorophore population. Viscosimetry—Viscosimetric measurements were performed on VISCODENS using a defined shear rate γ of 60 s–1 (27Bánó M. Strhársky I. Hrmo I. Rev. Sci. Inst. 2003; 74: 4788-4793Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The volume of the sample was 1.6 ml. The concentration of glucose oxidase was 22.8 μm. Samples were dialyzed overnight against 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, in the absence and presence of 6.67 m GdmHCl. Filtered buffer used for the overnight dialysis was used as a reference solvent for viscosimetry measurements. The thermal transitions were measured with a scanning rate of 20 K/h. The specific viscosity was calculated from the following,ηspec=η−η0η0(Eq. 2) where η is the relative viscosity of protein and η0 is the relative viscosity of the reference buffer. The reduced viscosity ηred (ml/g) can be calculated by applying the following equation,ηred=1c×ηspec(Eq. 3) where c represents the concentration of the protein in g/ml. Calculation of the intrinsic viscosity, [η], was possible from the reduced viscosity by the assumption of a highly diluted solution of the protein.[η]=limc→0ηred(Eq. 4) Cross-linking Using Glutaraldehyde—Various states, native and thermally and chemically denatured, of glucose oxidase were treated by glutaraldehyde as previously described (20Akhtar M.S. Ahmad A. Bhakuni V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7142-7149Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The modifications were as follows: (i) final concentration of glutaraldehyde was 5%, and (ii) time of incubation was 10 min. Protein, upon glutaraldehyde cross-linking, was dissolved in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, and 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Resulting samples were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE. To obtain reproducible results, a fresh solution of glutaraldehyde was made before experiments. Sedimentation Velocity—Sedimentation experiments were performed in the Center for Analytical Ultracentrifugation of Macromolecular Assemblies located in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (available on the World Wide Web at www.cauma.uthscsa.edu). Sedimentation velocity studies were performed in a Beckman XLA ultracentrifuge at 20 °C using optical absorption detection at 280 nm. Absorbance scans were collected at 50,000 rpm. The sedimentation velocity data were analyzed by the method of van Holde and Weischet (28van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The sedimentation coefficients, s20,w were calculated using the UltraScan (version 6.2.0.) computer software (available on the World Wide Web at www.ultrascan.uthscsa.edu) as previously described (29Musatov A. Ortega-Lopez J. Demeler B. Osborne J.P. Gennis R.B. Robinson N.C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 30Musatov A. Ortega-Lopez J. Robinson N.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12996-13004Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). All studies were performed on 3.2 μm GOX (Sigma) dialyzed for 12 h against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The molecular weight, Mr, of the GOX was calculated from Svedberg's equation as follows,Mr=S20,wRT(1−V¯ρo)D20,w(Eq. 5) where s20,w is the sedimentation coefficient corrected for density and viscosity, ρ is the solvent density, D is the diffusion coefficient, and V̄ is the partial specific volume of the protein. The partial specific volume was 0.714 cm3/g for GOX in buffer (31Nakamura S. Fujiki S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1968; 63: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and 0.704 cm3/g for GOX in buffer with GdmHCl (32O'Malley J. Weaver J.L. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3527-3532Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The viscosity and density correction of the aqueous solution of GdmHCl was made using published data (33Kawahara K. Tanford C. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3228-3232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The diffusion coefficient was 4.12 × 10–7 cm2/s (3Swoboda B.E.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2209-2215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of Thermal Denaturation—The thermal transition of glucose oxidase was analyzed using a two-state equation, yobs=yN+mN·T+(yU+mU·T)exp{ΔHvHR(1T−1Ttrs)}1+exp{ΔHvHR(1T−1Ttrs)}(Eq. 6) where yobs represents the observed spectral parameter, yN and yU are spectral parameters of the native (with slope mN) and denatured form (with slope mU), T is temperature (K), R is the gas constant 8.314 J/K/mol, ΔHvH is the apparent van't Hoff enthalpy, and Ttrs is the apparent temperature of transition (i.e. 50% of the population is in the native form). The data were fitted with computer software Grafit 3.0, using a simple weighted data nonlinear regression analysis. Calorimetry—Calorimetric (DSC) measurements were performed on a DASM-4 microcalorimeter at heating rates between 0.12 and 2 K/min. The measuring cell volume was of 0.4786 cm3. The protein concentration was determined using the flavin absorbance at 450 nm. All DSC traces were corrected for base line (34Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Subcell. Biochem. 1995; 24: 133-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The thermal transition of glucose oxidase was irreversible in all of the measured conditions. Nevertheless, the area under the DSC peak was used to calculate the enthalpy of the processes that accompanied the protein thermal denaturation. The transition temperature and the reversibility of the thermal transitions were not dependent on the protein (3.5–37.0 μm) and flavin concentration (0–3.6 mm). The pH values of the solutions were measured before and after cooling the sample. Samples with pH changes less than 0.2 pH units were used. Thermally Induced Denaturation of Glucose Oxidase— Changes in the absorption spectra of thermally and chemically denatured GOX are illustrated in Fig. 1. Although the observed changes were relatively small, they are well defined in both the absolute and differential mode. Flavin absorbance in the visible part of the spectra was used to follow the thermally induced changes in the active site of the protein at various protein concentrations (Fig. 2, inset A). The transition temperature of the thermal denaturation observed in the region of 350–550 nm was 55.7 °C. Upon cooling to 20 °C, the heat-induced changes in the GOX spectrum were irreversible (Fig. 2, inset B). Dialysis of the thermally denatured protein resulted in loss of the flavin molecule as revealed by the absence of the flavin fluorescence and absorbance (data not shown). Thus, the dissociation constant for the flavin molecule was strongly perturbed upon thermal denaturation, and the flavin cofactor dissociated from the active site as was previously suggested (3Swoboda B.E.P. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2209-2215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35O'Malley J.J. Ulmer R.W. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1973; 15: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This is in contrast with some other reports (36Masuda T. Sawa Y. Asai M. Kuwada S.J. Pharm. Soc. Japan. 1955; 75: 802-807Crossref Google Scholar, 37Ye W.N. Combes D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 999: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the transition temperature of thermal denaturation determined from the flavin absorbance was independent of the glucose oxidase concentration (Fig. 2, inset A). It should be pointed out that the samples were dialyzed before the thermal denaturation measurements. In contrast, an apparent concentration dependence was observed for undialyzed protein, probably due to the presence of stabilizers in the dry sample. Spectrophotometric measurements were also performed in the aromatic region (250–320 nm), where the tryptophan absorbance predominates over the contribution from the flavin cofactor. The denaturation curve, obtained from the difference spectra, was sigmoidal in shape without any apparent deviations, indicating a two-state transition (Fig. 2). The transition temperature of the thermal induced denaturation observed in this wavelength region was 54.6 °C and was also irreversible. The process of GOX thermal denaturation was also analyzed by circular dichroism (Fig. 3). CD measurements were performed at 222 nm (i.e. a wavelength that reflects changes in secondary structure). The observed changes led to nearly the same melting curve as in the case of absorbance spectroscopy, thus indicating that the secondary and tertiary structural changes proceeded at the same time with Ttrs 54.3 °C. The analysis of fit was performed using a two-state approximation. Randomly scattered residual graphs for the nonlinear regression strongly indicate the absence of intermediates monitored by ellipticity changes at 222 nm (Fig. 3, insets). Changes in the quaternary and tertiary structures were monitored by viscosimetry. Viscosimetry is sensitive to the overall shape of the protein and the surrounding hydration layer. The transition temperature obtained from viscosimetry equaled 53.8 °C (the thermal denaturation curve is shown in Fig. 13). Dependence of Thermal Transition on Protein and Cofactor Concentrations and Scan Rate—The different methods used required the use of different protein concentrations. The GOX concentration in the present work varied ∼25-fold, but this concentration variation did not affect the denaturation temperature of the protein (Fig. 4A). The independence of the thermal transition of the homodimeric GOX on its concentration was surprising. In the case of the reversible transition of the dimeric (multimeric) proteins with m monomeric units, there is a dependence of the melting temperature on the total concentration of the protein [N] (38Takahashi K. Sturtevant J.M. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6185-6190Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 39Marky L.A. Breslauer K.J. Biopolymers. 1987; 26: 1601-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar),∂1/Ttrs∂ln[N]=−R×(m−1)ΔHvH(Eq. 7) In the case of the irreversible process of the multimeric proteins, the plot ln[N] versus 1/Ttrs is also linear as it is for the equilibrium process. The slope of this plot for the irreversible transition is equal to the following (23Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 921-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar),∂ln[N]∂1/Ttrs=−m×EaR×(m−1)(Eq. 8) where R is the gas constant, and Ea is the activation barrier for the irreversible step. For the irreversible step, a lack of dependence of the transition temperature on the protein concentration indicates that the dissociation of the monomers is not part of the rate-determining irreversible reaction. Similarly, the thermal transition measured by DSC was independent of cofactor concentration. Even a 360-fold change in FAD concentration had no effect on the thermal transition or the reversibility of glucose oxidase (Fig. 4B). The irreversible processes associated with the thermal denaturation of the protein are generally sensitive to the scan rate because they are under kinetic control. However, when the thermal transition precedes the irreversible step, the denaturation is independent of the scan rate (23Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Biophys. J. 1992; 61: 921-935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar) as in the case of thermophilic EF-Ts (40Sedlák E. Valušová E. Nesper-Brock M. Antalík M. Sprinzl M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9579-9586Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The transition temperature of the irreversible thermal denaturation of GOX was dependent on the scan rate. Increasing the scan rate resulted in an increased melting temperature (Fig. 5). DASM-4 offers the possibility to vary the scan rate from 0.125 to 2 K/min (Fig. 6). Generally, an increase in the scan rate leads to an increase in the transition temperature up to a so-called high scan limit, where the irreversible step does not affect the hot side of the thermal peak. At this limit, the transition temperature versus the scan rate reaches a plateau (41Thorolfsson M. Ibarra-Molero B. Fojan P. Petersen S.B. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Martinez A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7573-7585Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Due to the intrinsic limitation of the scan rates used in DSC, the plateau was experimentally unachievable in our measurements (Fig. 6, inset).Fig. 6Arrhenius-like plot for the irreversible thermal transition of glucose oxidase from A. niger. Data obtained from DSC curves (Fig. 4) yields a linear dependence (coefficient of linearity of r = 0.9995). The slope of this plot equals –Ea/R. The experimental data are described by the line y = –(34.1 ± 0.7) × 103·x + (91 ± 2). The inset shows the dependence of the melting temperature on the scan rate, and the line connecting experimental points is only to guide the eyes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Different temperature slopes from various scan rates enabled us to analyze the irreversible step (42Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Lopez-Lacomba J.L. Cortijo M. Mateo P.L. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Plotting the data ln v/Ttrs2versus 1/Ttrs allowed us to determine the activation energy, Ea, from the slope of the dependence (Fig. 6). The activation energy of the irreversible step in the thermal denaturation of GOX is ∼280 kJ/mol (linear correlation coefficient r = 0.999). Cross-linking Studies—The quaternary structure of the thermally and chemically denatured proteins was compared by performing glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiments. Glutaraldehyde (bis-aldehyde homobifunctional cross-linker) may react by several routes to form a covalent cross-link with amine-containing molecules (43Hermanson G.T. Bioconjugate Techniques. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996Google Scholar). Reactions with proteins proceed through the formation of Schiff bases or Michael-type additions. Fig. 7 shows the results of the cross linking of the native and the thermally and chemically denatured GOX. For the native GOX the protein band of glutaraldehyde cross-linked samples corresponding only to dimers was observed (Fig. 7). For GOX treated with 6.67 m GdmHCl, only protein bands corresponding to monomers were observed in accordance with a recent study (20Akhtar M.S. Ahmad A. Bhakuni V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7142-7149Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For the thermally denatured GOX, three protein bands corresponding to dimers, trimers, and tetramers were observed. No significant amount of higher oligomers of the protein was observed (Fig. 7). Sedimentation Velocity—The integral distribution of s20,w of GOX was examined in three different experimental conditions (Fig. 8). GOX in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2 (triangles), was highly homogeneous with s20,w of 7.8 S. The molecular weight of the native GOX was calculated using Svedberg's equation (see Equation 5) and was found to be 157,000 Da, a value in excellent agreement with previously published data (1Hecht H.J.

Sedimentation velocity data of GOX in buffer containing 6.67 m GdmHCl (circles) yields an apparent sedimentation coefficient of sobs = 0.95 S, which corresponds to the s20,w = 2.8 S. Although the diffusion coefficient for GOX in GdmHCl is not known and, therefore, the molecular weight could not be calculated from sedimentation velocity data, based on previously published data for GOX in GdmHCl (20Akhtar M.S. Ahmad A. Bhakuni V. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7142-7149Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we believe that the s20,w value reflects the unfolded monomeric form of GOX. GOX was much more heterogeneous after temperature denaturation. The sedimentation coefficient across the sedimentation boundary varied between 3.6 and 11.0 S, which indicates formation of both smaller and larger molecules than dimeric GOX. Molecular weights for these s20,w values would be ∼73,000 (3.6 S) to 230,000 (11 S). Circular Dichroism of Native and Denatured States—Glucose oxidase is a flavoprotein that binds one flavin molecule per monomer in the buried active site. Interaction of the flavin molecule and the tryptophan residues makes circular dichroism a very suitable tool for the study of conformational changes in the active site of glucose oxidase. In the native state, glucose oxidase possesses a relatively strong CD signal in the visible, near-UV, and far-UV regions. The CD spectra show a positive Cotton effect at 375 nm that corresponds to the flavin moiety. There was no peak observed at 450 nm, where the"

This is to a large extent related to the close functional interdependence of mitochondria and chloroplasts, in which the two ATP-generating processes of oxidative phosphorylation and photosynthesis, respectively, take place. We show that digitonin treatment of mitochondria contaminated with chloroplasts from spinach (Spinacia oleracea) green leaves at two different buffer conditions, performed to solubilize oxidative phosphorylation supercomplexes, selectively extracts the mitochondrial membrane protein complexes and only low amounts of stroma thylakoid membrane proteins. By analysis of digitonin extracts from partially purified mitochondria of green leaves from spinach using blue and colorless native electrophoresis, we demonstrate for the first time that in green plant tissue a substantial proportion of the respiratory complex IV is assembled with complexes I and III into “respirasome”-like supercomplexes, previously observed in mammalian, fungal, and non-green plant mitochondria only. Thus, fundamental features of the supramolecular organization of the standard respiratory complexes I, III, and IV as a respirasome are conserved in all higher eukaryotes. Because the plant respiratory chain is highly branched possessing additional alternative enzymes, the functional implications of the occurrence of respiratory supercomplexes in plant mitochondria are discussed.

The respiratory complexes I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase), III (ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase), and IV (cytochrome c oxidase) transduce the energy of organic compounds ultimately leading to the generation of ATP by the MFOF1-ATP synthase. In contrast to the textbook view (2Hackenbrock C.R. Chazotte B. Gupte S.S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1986; 18: 331-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), it was recently proposed that the OXPHOS complexes of mammals are organized as large assemblies constituting a supramolecular network, the so-called “respirasome,” consisting of two supercomplexes (I1III2IV4 and III2IV4) as building blocks in a 2:1 ratio (3Schägger H.

This model was based on results by blue native PAGE (BN-PAGE) after mild solubilization of mitochondria with digitonin by which most of complexes I, III, and a smaller but significant proportion of complex IV were resolved as stoichiometric supercomplexes. Recently, it could be demonstrated that the complex IV-dependent respiratory chain of the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina is organized according to the respirasome model as well (7Krause F.

One of the most outstanding features of plant mitochondria is the functional cooperation with chloroplasts in photosynthetically active tissues (16Krömer S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 46: 45-70Crossref Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 17Raghavendra A.S. Padmasree K. Trends Plant Sci. 2003; 8: 546-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). As part of the photorespiratory pathway, mitochondria decarboxylate large quantities of glycine by reduction of NAD+ to NADH (16Krömer S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

The plant respiratory chain is branched due to the occurrence of additional alternative respiratory enzymes besides the respiratory complexes I-IV (for review, see Refs. 19Møller I.M. Annu. Rev.

Zhang Q. Smith M.K. Wiskich J.T. Day D.A. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 455-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The latter transfers electrons directly from ubiquinol to oxygen, thereby bypassing complexes III and IV. All these alternative enzymes are non-proton-pumping and consequently do not contribute to energy conservation. Until now, their functional significance for respiration in plants is enigmatic in many aspects (19Møller I.M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

Interestingly, an important link to photosynthesis emerged recently due to the discovery of light-dependent gene expression of some alternative respiratory enzymes (23Svensson A.S. Rasmusson A.G. Plant J. 2001; 28: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Michalecka A.M. Svensson A.S. Johansson F.I. Agius S.C. Johanson U. Brennicke A. Binder S. Rasmusson A.G. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 642-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To date, the only two studies addressing the supramolecular organization of the plant respiratory chain by BN-PAGE analysis found that in non-green tissue mitochondria of the four plant species Arabidopsis thaliana, potato, bean, and barley, 50–90% of complex I is assembled with complex III into the stable supercomplex I1III2 (25Eubel H. Jänsch L. Braun H.P. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), whereas stable interactions of complex IV with complex I and complex III could only be demonstrated in potato mitochondria (26Eubel H. Heinemeyer J. Braun H.P. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Importantly, these authors reported without further details that they detected only very minor amounts of complex IV-containing supercomplexes in Arabidopsis leaves (26Eubel H. Heinemeyer J. Braun H.P. Plant Physiol. 2004; 134: 1450-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To address the involvement of complex IV in any supramolecular organization of the standard respiratory complexes in photosynthetically active tissues of higher plant mitochondria, we analyzed digitonin extracts of partially purified mitochondria from spinach green leaves using BN-PAGE and a more gentle colorless native (CN)-PAGE. Our results show that under these conditions in HEPES/potassium acetate buffer (pH 7.4) or in Tricine/6-aminocaproic acid (6-ACA) buffer (pH 8.0), the mitochondrial membranes were selectively solubilized with only minor amounts of extracted stroma thylakoid membrane proteins. Significantly, the latter did not disturb the analysis of OXPHOS complexes. We demonstrate that most of complexes I, III, and to a lesser extent complex IV form common supercomplexes and reveal direct complex I-III as well as complex III-IV interactions, resembling the respirasome architecture of the mammalian and fungal standard respiratory chains. Additionally, a small proportion of the MFOF1-ATP synthase was observed in the dimeric state. Electrophoretic Techniques—Digitonin, n-decylmaltoside (DM), n-dodecylmaltoside (DDM), and n-dodecanoylsucrose (DS) were of high purity grade from Calbiochem Merck, as well as Triton X-100 of high purity grade from Roche Diagnostics. Commercially purchased spinach green leaves were used as starting material. Mitochondria were partially purified using a standard procedure by differential centrifugation and Percoll density gradient centrifugation (27Glaser E. Knorpp C. Hugosson M. von Stedingk E. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 50: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Pure chloroplasts were isolated as previously described (28Pick U. Racker E. J. Biol.

The samples were incubated for 30 min on ice unless otherwise indicated and subsequently centrifuged at 21,500 × g for 10 min.

Second-dimension SDS-PAGE and BN-PAGE of mitochondria-rich fractions revealed the characteristic compositions of subunits or of individual complexes, respectively, of the separated OXPHOS complexes and supercomplexes. Additionally, four different mitochondrial polypeptides (i.e. ND7 and ND9 from monomeric complex I and supercomplex a (I1III2) and the α- and β-subunits of monomeric complex V) as well as eight different chloroplast polypeptides (the large and small subunits of Rubisco, the E- and D-subunits of PSI, and the α-and γ-subunits of CFOF1 as well as cytochrome f and the subunit IV of b6f) were excised from second-dimension SDS gels, subjected to in-gel trypsinization, and identified by MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Applied Biosystems Voyager DE PRO) as described by Rexroth et al.

Separation of Respirasome-like Supercomplexes from Partially Purified Spinach Green Leaf Mitochondria after Selective Digitonin Solubilization—Mitochondria from green tissue have to be investigated to unravel the unique functions of plant mitochondria, especially of respiration, during photosynthesis. Using a standard procedure we prepared enriched mitochondrial fractions from spinach green leaves, which yet displayed green color, indicating a substantial contamination with chloroplasts. Over a period of 19 months nine independent mitochondria-rich fractions from spinach green leaves purchased from various sources have been prepared, each with a varying mitochondrial content. To examine whether a respirasome organization is present in mitochondria of higher plant green leaves, we solubilized such mitochondria-rich fractions with 1% (w/v) digitonin at a detergent/protein ratio of 1 g/g in HEPES/potassium acetate (pH 7.4) under approximately the same conditions as previously described, leading to the separation of respiratory supercomplexes from mammalian (3Schägger H.

Remarkably, after centrifugation the digitonin extracts always had only a very slight green color, in contrast to the dark green pellet, indicating that the thylakoid membranes of the contaminating chloroplasts were largely resistant against the digitonin treatment. To investigate this effect in more detail we compared one of the nine partially purified mitochondrial fractions possessing a particular high and clearly predominant chloroplast content (named M1) with pure chloroplasts both solubilized in the same manner with digitonin as well as with fraction M1 quantitatively solubilized by DS or DM. In fact, BN-PAGE analysis of the digitonin extract (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 2) revealed a protein band pattern very similar to that of individual OXPHOS complexes (molecular mass 130–1,000 kDa) and supercomplexes (molecular mass ≥1,500 kDa) from digitonin-solubilized bovine heart mitochondria (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 1). Besides one dominant chloroplast protein band at ∼450 kDa (Rubisco, see below) only one green protein complex could be recognized as a rather weak band at ∼650 kDa. The increase of the digitonin/protein ratio up to 10 resulted in a very similar pattern with one additional non-green protein complex at ∼600 kDa discernible on the BN gel (Fig. 1, A and B, lane 3) despite the predominant content of chloroplasts in this mitochondria-rich fraction. This became recognizable upon approximately quantitative solubilization with DM or DS, leading to a very thin colorless pellet after centrifugation and resulting in the separation of large amounts of chlorophyll-containing green protein bands (photosystems I and II, light-harvesting complexes) (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 6 and 7). In line with this observation, the digitonin treatment of pure spinach chloroplasts in HEPES/potassium acetate (pH 7.4) even at 10 g of digitonin/g of protein (Fig. 1, A and B, lanes 4 and 5) or using increased digitonin concentrations up to 7.5% (w/v) (not shown) was far less efficient than the solubilization with DM or DS. Most striking was the comparably minor yield of extracted green chlorophyll-containing proteins after digitonin treatment. Furthermore, it became apparent that some digitonin-solubilized proteins of pure chloroplasts were not or hardly were extracted from the mitochondria-rich fraction (Fig. 1, A and B, compare lanes 2 and 3 with 4 and 5). Interestingly, digitonin extraction of pure chloroplasts yielded minor amounts of heavy protein complexes (≥1,500 kDa); yields increased at higher digitonin/protein ratios. If these would be extracted from mitochondria-rich fractions, the identification of OXPHOS supercomplexes could be potentially complicated; this, however, was not the case (see below). The overall result was surprising at first glance because digitonin has been long since used as a very suitable detergent in chloroplast research (e.g.32Rexroth S. Meyer zu Tittingdorf J.M.W.

Increased function of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an enzyme involved in responding to metabolic stress, was recently shown to reduce the cytoplasmic levels of HuR. Here, we provide evidence that importin α1, an adaptor protein involved in nuclear import, contributes to the nuclear import of HuR through two AMPK-modulated mechanisms. First, AMPK triggered the acetylation of importin α1 on Lys22, a process dependent on the acetylase activity of p300. Second, AMPK phosphorylated importin α1 on Ser105. Accordingly, expression of importin α1 proteins bearing K22R or S105A mutations failed to mediate the nuclear import of HuR in intact cells. Our results point to importin α1as a critical downstream target of AMPK and key mediator of AMPK-triggered HuR nuclear import.

Post-transcriptional mechanisms of gene regulation, including mRNA export, turnover, and translation, are central to the implementation of specific gene expression patterns in mammalian cells. Among the post-transcriptional gene regulatory events, those affecting mRNA stability are emerging as highly effective means of altering mRNA abundance and consequently the levels of protein expressed (1Fan J.

Labile mRNAs can be selectively stabilized or destabilized through the action of particular RNA-binding proteins that recognize specific RNA sequences. One of the major pathways regulating mRNA turnover relies on the presence of U-rich or AU-rich sequences (collectively known as AREs), typically present in the 3′-untranslated regions of transcripts encoding many cytokines, growth factors, and cell cycle regulatory proteins (4Bevilacqua A.

RNA-binding proteins that recognize AREs and enhance mRNA stability include the Hu proteins: HuR (HuA), which is ubiquitously expressed, as well as HuB, HuC, HuD, primarily expressed in neuronal tissues (12Antic D.

HuR is predominantly (>90%) localized in the nucleus of unstimulated cells. However, its influence on mRNA stabilization and translation has been linked to its cytoplasmic presence, so there has been much interest in identifying the mechanisms regulating its presence in each cellular compartment (16Fan X.C.

In the nucleus, HuR has been shown to bind proteins SETα, SETβ, pp32, and APRIL (18Gallouzi I.-E. Brennan C.M. Steitz J.A. RNA. 2001; 7: 1348-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). SETα, SETβ, and pp32 have been identified as inhibitors of protein phosphatase 2A (31Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6998-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 32Saito S. Miyaji-Yamaguchi M. Shimoyama T. Nagata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 471-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), a serine/threonine phosphatase that becomes activated in response to various stimuli and dephosphorylates several major protein kinases (for review, see Ref. 33Schonthal A.H. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1262-D1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using cell-permeable peptides, HuR nuclear export was shown to involve the association of HuR with two of its nuclear ligands, pp32 and APRIL, which contain leucine-rich nuclear export signals that are recognized by the export receptor chromosome maintenance region 1 (CRM1). 1The abbreviations used are: CRM1, chromosome maintenance region 1; AICAR, 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide riboside; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; IP, immunoprecipitation; Kap, karyopherin; NPC, nuclear pore complex; HNS, HuR nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence; Trn, transportin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; Imp, importin; Sbutyr, sodium butyrate; TSA, trychostatin A; HA, hemagglutinin; NLS, nuclear localization sequence.1The abbreviations used are: CRM1, chromosome maintenance region 1; AICAR, 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide riboside; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; IP, immunoprecipitation; Kap, karyopherin; NPC, nuclear pore complex; HNS, HuR nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence; Trn, transportin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; Imp, importin; Sbutyr, sodium butyrate; TSA, trychostatin A; HA, hemagglutinin; NLS, nuclear localization sequence. Treatment with the CRM1 inhibitor leptomycin B caused the nuclear accumulation of pp32 and APRIL, as well as the increased association of HuR with pp32 and APRIL in the nucleus (34Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. Science. 2001; 294: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Alternative pathways of nuclear export have been proposed to involve a shuttling sequence within HuR, the HuR nucleocytoplasmic shuttling sequence (HNS), which bears similarities with the M9 shuttling signal of hnRNP A1, (27Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15293-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 34Gallouzi I.E. Steitz J.A. Science. 2001; 294: 1895-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), but the export factor involved in HNS-dependent transport is currently unknown (35Rebane A. Aab A. Steitz J.A. RNA. 2004; 10: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Although a role for HuR in the export of target mRNAs awaits to be definitively demonstrated, evidence accumulated thus far strongly supports such a function. Therefore, the existence of multiple export pathways for HuR would ensure the rapid and effective export of HuR target mRNAs. Recently, transportin 1 (Trn1; also known as Karyopherin/Kapβ2) as well as the highly similar transportin 2 (Trn2) were shown to participate in the nuclear import of HuR (36Güttinger S. Mühlhäusser P. Koller-Eichhorn R. Brennecke J. Kutay U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2918-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In a series of elegant in vitro studies, the HNS was found to mediate the import of HuR by transportins (35Rebane A. Aab A. Steitz J.A. RNA. 2004; 10: 590-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 36Güttinger S. Mühlhäusser P. Koller-Eichhorn R. Brennecke J. Kutay U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2918-2923Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In vivo, the levels of cytoplasmic HuR have been shown to be potently regulated by the activity of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an enzyme that participates in the cellular response to metabolic stress (37Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). Believed to function as a “low fuel warning system” of the cell, AMPK activity is strongly elevated by conditions that elevate the cellular AMP:ATP ratio, such as exposure to metabolic poisons like arsenite and azide, depletion of growth factors or glucose, and treatment with the pharmacological agent AICAR (which mimics the effect of AMP) (38Hardie D.G. Salt I.P. Davies S.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 99: 63-74PubMed Google Scholar). In turn, active AMPK phosphorylates a number of metabolic enzymes causing both a global inhibition of biosynthetic pathways, thus conserving energy, and a global activation of catabolic pathways, thus generating more ATP (reviewed in Ref. 39Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). AMPK activity is ubiquitous, although different isoforms of its catalytic (α) and regulatory (β and γ) subunits exhibit tissue-specific distribution, as well as preferential localization in different subcellular compartments (e.g. α2 subunits are partly nuclear, whereas α1 subunits are only found in the cytoplasm, etc.). Recently, we found that decreased AMPK activity led to an elevation in cytoplasmic HuR levels; conversely, AMPK activation through interventions such as treatment with AICAR and ectopic expression of a constitutively active isoform of AMPK caused a reduction in cytoplasmic HuR (40Wang W. Fan J. Yang X. Fürer S. Lopez de Silanes I. von Kobbe C. Guo J. Georas S.N. Foufelle F. Hardie D.G. Carling D. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3425-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The lowering of cytoplasmic HuR was accompanied by a reduction in complexes of HuR bound to target mRNAs encoding proliferative proteins (cyclins A and B1), a decrease in the stability of such mRNAs, a lessening in the expression of the corresponding protein products, and an ensuing inhibition of cell growth (40Wang W. Fan J. Yang X. Fürer S. Lopez de Silanes I. von Kobbe C. Guo J. Georas S.N. Foufelle F. Hardie D.G. Carling D. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3425-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Given that HuR shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm (26Atasoy U. Watson J. Patel D. Keene J.D. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3145-3156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fan X.C. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15293-15298Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 29Keene J.D.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) and given that AMPK-triggered reductions in cytoplasmic HuR levels profoundly influence the stability of target mRNAs (40Wang W. Fan J. Yang X. Fürer S. Lopez de Silanes I. von Kobbe C. Guo J. Georas S.N. Foufelle F. Hardie D.G. Carling D. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3425-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), we set out to investigate the mechanisms underlying the AMPK-mediated nuclear import of HuR. In this investigation, we have identified importin α1 as a key cytoplasmic HuR ligand mediating this process. Importin α1 functions as an adaptor that associates with importin β, which transports bound cargoes through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). We provide additional evidence in support of a role for AMPK in dually modifying importin α1: AMPK triggered the acetylation of importin α1 through AMPK-stimulated activation of acetylase p300, and AMPK directly phosphorylated importin α1, both in vivo and in vitro. Importantly, overexpression of wild-type full-length importin α1, but not point mutants of importin α1 lacking the phosphorylation and acetylation sites, readily promoted the nuclear import of HuR in intact cells. Together, our data indicate that AMPK induces the acetylation and phosphorylation of importin α1 and strongly suggest that dual modification of importin α1 is required for the nuclear import of HuR. Cell Culture, Treatment, Transfection, and Infection—Human colorectal carcinoma RKO cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (41Gorospe M. Wang X. Guyton K.Z. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 7: 1609-1615Google Scholar), and human embryo kidney fibroblasts 293 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium, each supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and antibiotics. Sodium butyrate, trichostatin A, and AICAR were from Sigma, and calpain inhibitor I, N-Ac-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (ALLN) was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Adenoviruses expressing either the control gene GFP (AdGFP) or a constitutively active isoform of the AMPK α1 subunit (Ad(CA)AMPK) (42Woods A. Azzout-Marniche D. Foretz M. Stein S.C. Lemarchand P. Ferré P. Foufelle F. Carling D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6704-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) were amplified and titered in 293 cells using standard methodologies. The infections were carried out in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 4 h. Infection efficiency of RKO cells was determined by infection with AdGFP at various plaque-forming units/cell and assessment of the percentage of GFP-expressing cells 48 h later. For >90% infection, 100 plaque-forming units/cell was required, in accordance with the low infection rates of RKO cells (41Gorospe M. Wang X. Guyton K.Z. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 7: 1609-1615Google Scholar); 100 and 20 plaque-forming units/cell were used in all infections of RKO and 293 cells, respectively. Cytoplasmic, nuclear, and whole cell fractions were prepared as described (24Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Constructs and Recombinant Proteins—All of the purified recombinant proteins were produced in Escherichia coli. His-tagged (C-terminal) importin α1 was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography followed by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. GST-Impβ and GST-Kapβ2 were purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography, cleaved with either Precission protease (Impβ) or Tev protease (Kapβ2), and Impβ and Kapβ2 were further purified by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography (43Chook Y.M. Jung A. Rosen M.K. Blobel G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6955-6966Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Bacterial expression constructs were prepared by ligating PCR-amplified inserts into plasmid pBAD-TOPO (Invitrogen). For expression in mammalian cells, PCR-amplified full-length and truncated importin α1 cDNA products were inserted into plasmid pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). Plasmid pCMVβ-p300 was used for expression of p300 in cultured cells (Upstate USA Inc., Lake Placid, NY). For expression in mammalian cells, importin α1 proteins bearing either a lysine-to-arginine mutation on residue 22 (Impα1(K22R)) or a serine-to-alanine mutation on residue 105 (Impα1(S105A)), or both mutations (Impα1(S105A,K22R)) were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and were expressed in plasmid pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). All of the constructs were verified by sequencing. Antibodies and Western Blot Analysis—For Western blotting, whole cell (20 μg), cytoplasmic (40 μg), and nuclear (10 μg) lysates, prepared as previously described (24Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H.

Monoclonal antibodies recognizing β-tubulin (a control cytoplasmic protein), HDAC1 (a control nuclear protein), HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC4, c-Myc, and cyclin A, as well as polyclonal antibodies recognizing CRM1 and p300, were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibodies recognizing importin β, transportin 1/Kapβ2, importin α1, NF-κB, NTF2, Ran, Ran-BP1, Nup-98, Nup-88, and Nup-62 were from BD Pharmaceuticals. Polyclonal antibodies recognizing histone H4 and acetylated histone H4 were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). A monoclonal antibody recognizing HuR (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was used. Anti-HA antibody was from Qiagen. Polyclonal antibodies recognizing importins α1, α3, α4, α5, and α7 were previously described (44Köhler M. Speck C. Christiansen M. Bischoff F.R. Prehn S. Haller H. Gorlich D. Hartmann E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7782-7791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following secondary antibody incubations, signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum recognizing acetylated importin α1 was a generous gift from Dr. T. Kouzarides (45Bannister A.J. Miska E.A. Gorlich D. Kouzarides T. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 467-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Whole cell lysates for immunoprecipitation (IP) were prepared by adding 200 μl of IP buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 nm microcystin-LR, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm trichostatin A, 20 mm sodium butyrate, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 0.1 mm benzamidine) supplemented with 0.5% SDS. Each sample was passed through a 27.5-gauge needle 20 times and then centrifuged (10 min, 4 °C, 21,000 × g). IP reactions were carried out by using 20 μl of the resulting supernatant, diluting it with 1 ml of IP buffer, and adding 2 μg of the antibodies indicated above. The washes were performed as follows: three times with IP buffer, four times with a high stringency buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm LiCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 nm microcystin-LR, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm trichostatin A, 20 mm sodium butyrate, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and 0.1 mm benzamidine), and then three times with IP buffer. Pulse Labeling of Endogenous Protein—RKO cells (200,000 cells/6-cm dish) were incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free medium containing 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 30 min and then for an additional 20 min with 900 μCi of l-[35S]methionine and l-[35S]cysteine (NEG-072 Expre35S35S Protein labeling mix; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) per well and scraped into 500 μl of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation (1,800 rpm, 4 °C, 1 min), the pellets were shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and resuspended in 100 μl of TSD lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% SDS, and 5 mm DTT). One hundred-μg protein aliquots were brought to a final volume of 1.2 ml in TNN buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 ng/μl aprotinin, and 2 ng/μl leupeptin) and precleared with protein A/G (1:1)-Sepharose mix (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. Following a brief centrifugation, the supernatants were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 0.4 μg of either a monoclonal antibody that recognizes HuR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or IgG1 (BD Biosciences Pharmingen) and precipitated using 50 μl of protein A/G (1:1) mix (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. Following washes in TNN buffer, the IP material was resolved by electrophoresis in SDS-containing 12% polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride filters, and visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). AMPK and HDAC Activity Assays—AMPK was assayed as described (38Hardie D.G. Salt I.P. Davies S.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 99: 63-74PubMed Google Scholar, 40Wang W. Fan J. Yang X. Fürer S. Lopez de Silanes I. von Kobbe C. Guo J. Georas S.N. Foufelle F. Hardie D.G. Carling D. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3425-3436Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Briefly, AMPK was immunoprecipitated from 5 μg of cell lysate by incubation with 1 μg of anti-α1 and 1 μg of anti-α2 polyclonal antibodies, and AMPK activity in the IP complexes was determined by phosphorylation of peptide HMRSAMSGLHLVKRR (SAMS (38Hardie D.G. Salt I.P. Davies S.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 99: 63-74PubMed Google Scholar)). Synthetic peptides encompassing Ser77 (71QGTVNWSVDDIVKGI85), Ser105 (98QAARKLLSREKQ PPID113), and Ser179 (172ASPHAHISEQAVWALG187) were obtained from AnaSpec, Inc. (San Jose, CA) and used in phosphorylation assays employing AMPK as kinase, following the procedures described above for the SAMS peptide. Phosphorylated substrates were measured by scintillation counting. HDAC activity was measured with a histone deacetylase assay kit from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., following the manufacturer's instructions; histone H4 was used as a substrate. Acetylation of Importin α1 by p300 —Following infection of RKO cells with either AdGFP or Ad(CA)AMPK, p300 was immunoprecipitated from 100 μg of nuclear lysate (prepared as previously described (24Wang W. Furneaux H. Cheng H. Caldwell M.C. Hutter D. Liu Y. Holbrook N.J. Gorospe M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar)) using 3 μg of an anti-p300 monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). p300 bound to G protein-coupled Sepharose beads was incubated with a reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 μg of purified His-Impα1 protein, 20 μm acetyl-CoA, and 1 μCi of [3H]acetyl-CoA for 30 min at 30 °C in a shaking incubator. The reaction mixtures were then size-separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and radiolabeled acetylated proteins were visualized using a phosphorimaging device (Molecular Dynamics). Protein Phosphorylation Assays—Active AMPK was immunoprecipitated from 200 μg of lysate prepared from 293 cells that had been infected with Ad(CA)AMPK, using an anti-c-Myc antibody and G protein-coupled Sepharose beads. For in vitro phosphorylation assays, the proteins that were either immunoprecipitated from RKO cells or purified from bacteria were incubated with AMPK (bound to G protein-coupled Sepharose beads) in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]dATP and kinase buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, 1 mm DTT, 0.02% Brij-35, 6.25 mm MgCl2, and 0.25 mm AMP for 10 min at 30 °C. Phosphorylated products were size-fractionated by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Phosphorylated products were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). For in vivo phosphorylation assays, cultured cells were incubated with 0.5 mCi/ml H332PO4 (32Pi), for 3 h under standard conditions (37 °C, 5% CO2), and phosphorylation of either p300 or importin α1 was detected by IP using antibodies from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. or BD Biosciences, respectively. Solution Binding Assays—Solution binding assays were performed essentially as described (46Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Two μg of either MBP-HuR or His-importin α1 immobilized on 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads using either anti-MBP or anti-His antibodies, respectively, were incubated with 2 μg of either Impβ, Kapβ2, MBP (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), MBP-HuR, Impα1, or a combination of these proteins for 45 min at 25 °C. The proteins bound to products immobilized on beads, as well as proteins remaining unbound, were visualized after 12% SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Blue dye. Immunofluorescence—293 cells were seeded on coverslips and were transfected with the plasmids indicated. Forty-eight h after transfection, the cells were fixed for 15 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized for 15 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4% Triton X-100. After incubation for 16 h in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20), the coverslips were incubated for 1 h at 1:500 dilution of mouse anti-HuR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology.) prepared in blocking buffer. Following washes with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the samples were incubated for 1 h with a mixture of horse anti-mouse Texas Red (1:200; Jackson Laboratories) and Hoechst 33342 (1:5,000; Molecular Probes). After washes with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and visualized with an Axiovert 200 m microscope (Zeiss; 63× lens) using separate channels for the analysis of red fluorescence and blue fluorescence. The images were processed with the AxioVision 3.0 program (Zeiss). Representative photographs from three independent experiments are shown. Reduced Cytoplasmic HuR Levels after AMPK Activation— Treatment of human colorectal carcinoma RKO cells with the AMP analog AICAR, a strong and highly specific activator of AMPK (38Hardie D.G. Salt I.P. Davies S.P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 99: 63-74PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A), markedly reduced the levels of cytoplasmic HuR (Fig. 1B). Evidence that the AMPK-imposed reduction in cytoplasmic HuR abundance was not due to increased cytoplasmic degradation of HuR was obtained by using inhibitors of the proteasome and proteases. As shown in Fig. 1C, pretreatment with ALLN (which inhibits the activity of the proteasome, calpain, and cathepsins) failed to prevent the reduction in cytoplasmic HuR levels elicited through treatment with AICAR (Fig. 1C); use of proteasome inhibitor lactacystin or protease inhibitors ALLM or PD150606 similarly failed to alter the reduction in cytoplasmic HuR levels triggered by AICAR (not shown). In addition, the AMPK-imposed reduction in cytoplasmic HuR abundance was not due to decreased translation, as observed by assessing nascent HuR levels. De novo synthesis of HuR was monitored by pulse labeling (for 20 min) of RKO cells in the presence of"

We previously identified thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) as a physiologic activator of TGF-β in vitro and in vivo. The WSXW sequences in the type 1 repeats of TSP1 interact with the mature domain of TGF-β, and WSXW peptides inhibit TSP1-mediated activation by blocking TSP1 binding to the TGF-β latent complex. However, the binding site for the WSXW sequence was not identified. In this report, we show that the WSXW sequences bind the 61VLAL sequence in mature TGF-β and also bind 77VLAL in LAP. A glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of the second TSP1 type 1 repeat (GST-TSR2) binds immobilized VLAL peptide. VLAL peptides inhibit binding of LAP and mature TGF-β to soluble GST-TSR2 and immobilized WSXW peptide. VLAL peptide inhibits TSP1-mediated activation of recombinant and endothelial cell-derived latent TGF-β. Furthermore, TGF-β or LAP deleted in the VLAL sequence fails to bind immobilized WSXW or soluble GST-TSR2, indicating that binding to both VLAL sequences is important for association of TSP1 and the latent complex. Additionally, TSP1 is unable to activate latent TGF-β when VLAL is deleted from the mature domain. These data show that the WSXW motif binds VLAL on both LAP and mature TGF-β, and these interactions are critical for TSP1-mediated activation of the TGF-β latent complex.

TGF-β is a member of a large family of related peptide growth factors, including activins, inhibins, and bone morphogenic proteins (1Massague J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 597-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (3004) Google Scholar). There are five isoforms of TGF-β, including the three mammalian isoforms, TGFβ1, -2, and -3. Mature TGF-β is secreted as part of the small latent complex with latency-associated peptide (LAP) (5Gentry L.E. Lioubin M.N. Purchio A.F. Marquardt H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The small latent complex can also be bound to latent TGF-β-binding protein to form the large latent complex (6Miyazono K. Hellman U. Wernstedt C. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6407-6415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mature TGF-β and LAP are the products of a single gene that undergoes extensive post-translational modification, including cleavage of the LAP from the mature domain by furin convertase (7Dubois C.M. Laprise M.H. Blanchette F. Gentry L.E. Leduc R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10618-10624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Despite this cleavage, LAP and TGF-β remain noncovalently associated in a manner that confers latency. Mechanisms that involve conversion of the latent complex to a physiologically active form represent a major point of regulation of appropriate TGF-β activity levels (8Munger J.S. Harpel J.G.

Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). Since LAP association with the mature domain is critical for latency, agents that activate the latent complex disrupt the association of LAP with the mature domain either by cleaving or denaturing LAP or by altering the folding of LAP (8Munger J.S.

TSPs are a family of secreted glycoproteins present in the α-granules of platelets and wound fluids (12Mosher D.F. Annu. Rev.

Chen H. Mosher D.F. Misenheimer T.M. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol.

Poczatek M. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). The KRFK sequence in the type 1 repeats (TSRs) of TSP1 binds LAP through the LSKL sequence, resulting in biologically active TGF-β (17Ribeiro S.M. Poczatek M. Schultz-Cherry S. Villain M. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13586-13593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We also showed that tryptophan-rich (WSXW) sequences present in each of the TSRs bind to the mature domain (16Schultz-Cherry S. Chen H. Mosher D.F. Misenheimer T.M. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7304-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Unlike the KRFK sequence, the WSXW sequence is not sufficient to activate latent TGF-β. However, the WSXW sequence is important for activation by TSP1, since the WSXW sequence, when expressed as a peptide, competitively blocks both TSP1 binding to the mature domain and activation of the latent TGF-β complex by TSP1 (16Schultz-Cherry S. Chen H. Mosher D.F. Misenheimer T.M. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 13586-13593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of the WSXW sequence in peptides containing the KRFK activation sequence renders the KRFK sequence significantly less effective at activating latent TGF-β (16Schultz-Cherry S. Chen H. Mosher D.F. Misenheimer T.M. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7304-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The WSXW sequences are present in all of the TSRs of both TSP1 and TSP2. In fact, TSP2, which lacks the KRFK activation sequence, can inhibit the activation of TGF-β by TSP1 in vitro, presumably due to TSP2 binding to latent TGF-β through the tryptophan-rich motifs (16Schultz-Cherry S. Chen H. Mosher D.F. Misenheimer T.M. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7304-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the second and third TSR has recently been solved; the structure of the TSRs suggests that the WSXW sequences are on exposed surfaces and potentially available for binding interactions (19Tan K. Duquette M. Liu J.H. Dong Y. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Lawler J. Wang J.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). This is consistent with other published data showing that the tryptophan-rich motifs bind heparin and sulfated proteoglycans (20Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Negre E. Vogel T. Blake D.A. Roberts D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3040-3044Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 21Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Negre E. Zabrenetzky V.S. Roberts D.D. J. Biol.

Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 469-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the WSXW motif is common to the cytokine receptor superfamilies (23Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Crossref PubMed Scopus (1879) Google Scholar). Despite the importance of the WSXW sequence for TSP1-dependent TGF-β activation and the utility of the WSXW peptides in inhibiting activation, WSXW interactions with the TGF-β latent complex are poorly understood. In this work, we now identify the binding site for the WSXW sequence in mature TGF-β as the VLAL sequence. Unexpectedly, this sequence is also present in the LAP, and we now show that LAP also binds to the TSRs through the WSXW sequence. VLAL peptides and VLAL mutations inhibit binding of the latent complex to WSXW and the type 1 repeats. Also, VLAL peptides and deletion of VLAL in the mature domain inhibit TSP1-mediated activation of the latent TGF-β complex. These data support the model that VLAL/WSXW interactions are necessary for proper association of TSP1 and the latent complex and are critical for TSP1-mediated TGF-β activation. Cell Culture—Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Bovine aortic endothelial (BAE) cells were isolated and cultured as described (17Ribeiro S.M. Poczatek M. Schultz-Cherry S. Villain M. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol.

Peptides—Peptides, purified (>95% purity) and analyzed by mass spectrometry, were purchased from AnaSpec, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). Thrombospondin Purification—TSP1 stripped of TGF-β activity (sTSP) was purified as described from human platelets purchased from the American Red Cross (25Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Schultz-Cherry S. Hook M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). sTSP purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Depletion of TGF-β activity was confirmed by a plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter luciferase (PAIL) assay, which showed less than 1 pm TGF-β activity in 10 nm sTSP.

Using techniques similar to those previously reported, a FLAG epitope was introduced at the N terminus of the mature cytokine after a 5-amino acid spacer, separating it from the LAP cleavage site (28Wolfraim L.A. Alkemade G.M. Alex B. Sharpe S. Parks W.T. Letterio J.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 266: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The purified PCR product was then inserted, according to the manufacturer's instructions, into the mammalian expression vector pEF6/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen). Resulting plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing at the University of Alabama Birmingham Center for Aids Research DNA sequencing facility. Placement of the FLAG epitope at this site has been shown not to affect expression and function of active TGF-β1 (28Wolfraim L.A. Alkemade G.M. Alex B. Sharpe S. Parks W.T. Letterio J.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 266: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Using similar protocols, we expressed the construct in COS-1 cells and assayed for proper processing and secretion by immunoblot. In addition, the PAIL assay was used to verify latency and activation by heat, acid, and TSP1. Production of LAP-FLAG—Using the human TGF-β1 latent complex as a template, a FLAG epitope/termination codon was introduced following the LAP coding sequence. The resulting PCR product was cloned into pEF6/V5-His-TOPO (Invitrogen) as described above and sequenced for verification. LAP-FLAG protein expression in transfected COS-1 cells was confirmed by immunoblot, and the ability to confer latency to active TGF-β was verified by the PAIL assay. Site-directed Mutagenesis and DNA Purification—Using FLAG-TGF-β and LAP-FLAG vectors as templates, primers were designed to produce site-specific mutations or deletions using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). All mutant clones were verified by sequencing. Before transfection, all plasmids were produced, purified free of endotoxin, and concentrated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Transfection and Conditioned Medium Collection—Upon reaching 70% confluence in 100-mm dishes, COS-1 cells were washed in serum-free medium and transfected with 2 μg of DNA and 6 μl of Fugene-6 (Roche Applied Science) per the manufacturer's instructions in a final volume of 5 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with ITS (insulin, transferrin, selenium) supplement (Sigma). After 48 h, the conditioned media were collected, centrifuged free of cell debris, and stored for analyses. TGF-β1(–/–) cells, 70% confluent on 6-well plates, were transfected overnight with 1 μg of DNA using LipofectAMINE/Plus and Opti-MEM as per instructions (Invitrogen). Wells were then washed with serum-free media, followed by the addition of 1 ml/well serum-free media containing ITS. After 48 h, media were collected, centrifuged free of cell debris, and stored. BAE cells were seeded in 100-mm dishes, grown to 70% confluence, and washed with serum-free media. A final volume of 5 ml of serum-free media was placed on the cells for 48 h, collected, centrifuged free of cell debris, and stored at –80 °C until analysis. FLAG-TGF-β Purification—Recombinant FLAG-TGF-β or FLAG-TGF-β ΔVLAL was purified from conditioned media by anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Briefly, 15 ml of conditioned media was concentrated to 5 ml using 6-ml Vivaspin columns (Vivascience). The resulting concentrated medium was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 200 μl of prewashed anti-FLAG M2 resin. The following morning, the resin was washed three times in TBS. Bound FLAG-TGF-β was released by incubation in 200 μl of 0.1 m glycine HCl, pH 3.5. These acidic conditions also denature any associated LAP. 22 μl of 10× TBS was added, and the purified protein was stored at –80 °C until use. Purity was determined by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot with antibodies against TGF-β and FLAG. Protein concentration and activity were verified by the PAIL assay. Immunoblotting—Conditioned media were added to 6× Laemmli sample buffer, and a 50-μl final volume was separated by SDS-PAGE (4–20% gradient) under nonreducing conditions. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and then blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). Membranes were incubated with primary antibody, 12.5 μg of mouse anti-TGF-β (R&D Systems), or 2 μg of goat anti-human LAP (R&D Systems), overnight in 10 ml of TBST plus 2.5% nonfat dry milk at 4 °C. Membranes were washed (four 10-min washes in TBST) and then incubated for 45 min with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-goat secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted 1:10,000 in 10 ml of TBST plus 2.5% nonfat dry milk. For anti-FLAG blots and anti-GST blots, the membrane was blocked overnight, washed, and incubated with either a 1:2000 dilution of anti-FLAG-M2-peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) or a 1:5000 dilution of anti-GST peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences) in 10 ml of TBST for 45 min. Immunoblots were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Blots probed with more than one antibody were stripped between developments with Re-blot Plus (Mild) Solution according to the manufacturer's instructions (Chemicon). Densitometry was performed using the one-dimensional gel analysis function of ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). PAIL Assay for TGF-β Activity—TGF-β activity in conditioned media was determined by an established bioassay using mink lung epithelial cells expressing the TGF-β response element of the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter fused to luciferase as a reporter (24Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Human TGF-β1 (R&D Systems) was used to establish the standard curve. Total TGF-β levels were assayed in conditioned media that had been heat-activated at 100 °C for 3 min and then diluted 1:10 in serum-free media. Levels of active TGF-β were determined in media diluted 1:5 that received no heat treatment. Recombinant latent TGF-β or recombinant active TGF-β (R&D Systems) was diluted in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to the indicated concentrations. VLAL and control peptides were incubated with purified stripped TSP1 or KRFK peptide for 30 min. The preceding mixtures were then incubated with conditioned media or latent TGF-β for 30 min to assess activation of TGF-β by TSP1 or KRFK. Immunoprecipitation—In order to detect soluble protein-protein interactions, either 25 pm purified FLAG-TGF-β or FLAG-TGF-β ΔVLAL in 500 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium or 500 μl of TGF-β1 (–/–) conditioned medium expressing LAP-FLAG or ΔVLAL LAP-FLAG was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 100 nm GST-TSR2. 20 μl (final volume) of prewashed anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel was then added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Resin was centrifuged and washed in TBS three times. The washed resin was incubated with 20 μl of 0.1 m glycine HCl, pH 3.5, to release any bound complexes. The releasate was combined with 2.2 μl of 10× TBS and 6× SDS Laemmli sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. In some experiments, peptides were added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature prior to the addition of the affinity gel. Equal pull-down of FLAG-TGF-β or LAP-FLAG was verified by FLAG immunoblot/densitometry. Negative controls included resin alone and resin incubated with 100 nm GST-TSR2. 500 ng of recombinant GST-TSR2 was used as a positive control. Modified Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—In order to detect immobilized protein-protein interactions, we developed a novel modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for these studies. Briefly, biotin-tagged peptides (10 μg/ml) were incubated on preblocked neutravidin-coated plates overnight at 4 °C (Pierce). After three washes with TBST, conditioned media containing either 25 pm purified FLAG-TGF-β or FLAG-TGF-β ΔVLAL in TBS, TGF-β1 (–/–) conditioned medium expressing LAP-FLAG or ΔVLAL LAP-FLAG, or 100 nm GST-TSR2 in TBS was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. Following three washes with TBST, wells were incubated in 1:1000 anti-FLAG M2 peroxidase conjugate or 1:5000 anti-GST peroxidase conjugate in TBST. After five washes in TBST, wells were incubated for 30 min in OPD substrate (Sigma). The reaction was stopped with 1 n HCl, and absorbance was determined using a spectrophotometric plate reader (Bio-Tek). After background subtraction, the mean absorbance at 450 nm of triplicate wells was reported. In some experiments, conditioned media were incubated with peptides for 45 min at 4 °C prior to the addition to the wells. Biotin-tagged peptides were analyzed for equal binding to the plate by detection with Strepavidin-horseradish peroxidase. Controls included wells incubated with each reagent alone or wells coated with non-biotin-tagged peptides. To assess any nonspecific binding, 5 μm ovalbumin, 0.5 μm recombinant LAP (R&D Systems), 0.1 μm recombinant TGF-β1 (R&D Systems), 5 μm FLAG peptide (Sigma), or 1 μm GST was incubated with immobilized biotin-tagged peptides. Statistics—Significance was determined by using the paired, two-tailed Student's t test. All error bars shown represent S.D. Both Mature TGF-β and LAP Bind WSXW—In order to detect the association of TGF-β and WSXW, as has been previously reported (16Schultz-Cherry S. Chen H. Mosher D.F. Misenheimer T.M. Krutzsch H.C. Roberts D.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7304-7310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar), a modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was employed. Biotin-tagged peptides containing the sequence, GGWSHW, from the trytophan-rich motif of the TSRs, were immobilized to neutravidin-coated plates. Purified FLAG-tagged mature TGF-β1 (FLAG-TGF-β1) was then added to each well and detected with an anti-FLAG antibody conjugated to peroxidase. Binding, as indicated by absorbance at 450 nm, was highest between TGF-β and the immobilized tryptophan motif peptide (biotin-GGWSHW) (Fig. 1A). Binding to peptides in which the tryptophan was substituted with alanine (biotin-GGASHA) was significantly reduced (p < 0.002). There was no significant binding to soluble tryptophan motif peptide (GGWSHW) or uncoated wells. Finally, to demonstrate that the detection of FLAG-TGF-β bound to immobilized GGWSHW is specific, FLAG peptide or unlabeled recombinant TGF-β1 was substituted for FLAG-TGF-β, and binding levels were similar to uncoated wells. There was also no detectable binding of an irrelevant protein (ovalbumin) to wells coated with biotin-GG-WSHW (data not shown). TSP1 is able to form a ternary complex with both LAP and mature TGF-β (17Ribeiro S.M. Poczatek M. Schultz-Cherry S. Villain M. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13586-13593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability of LAP to bind the tryptophan motif was also tested. Utilizing a similar assay, recombinant LAP with a C-terminal FLAG-tag (LAP-FLAG) was produced in TGF-β1 (–/–) cells to avoid complications of endogenous TGF-β1. Conditioned medium obtained from these cells was heat-activated and tested in the PAIL assay to verify lack of endogenous TGF-β (data not shown). The modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to test the ability of LAP-FLAG to bind the immobilized tryptophan motif. LAP-FLAG binding to the immobilized tryptophan peptide (biotin-GGWSHW) was greater than binding to the control peptide (biotin-GGASHA) (Fig. 1B). As with FLAG-TGF-β, no significant binding of LAP-FLAG to soluble peptide (GGWSHW) or uncoated wells was observed. There was no detectable binding between immobilized GGSWHSW and unlabeled recombinant LAP or FLAG peptide in this assay. These data show that both FLAG-TGF-β and LAP-FLAG bind the immobilized WSXW motif. Analysis of the TGF-β Sequence for Potential WSXW Binding Sequences—Since the WSXW sequence binds to both the LAP and the mature domain, the sequence of the latent complex was scanned to determine whether there might be a sequence common to both proteins. The sequence VLAL is present in both the LAP (amino acids 77–80) and the mature domain (amino acids 61–64). The VLXL motif is conserved in the mature domain of vertebrate TGF-β1 to -3 isoforms (Table I). Each VLXL sequence begins at amino acid 61 of the mature domain and has only a conserved variation (Ala, Ser, or Gly) in the third position. The LAP VLXL motifs (Table II) are conserved in vertebrate β1 and β3 LAPs. The β2 LAP sequence (VISI) contains conservative isoleucine for leucine substitutions. The VLAL sequence in the mature TGF-β1 dimer is part of a three-turn α-helix (Fig. 2A), which is in an exposed region of the molecule where the subunits of the dimer interface (29Hinck A.P. Archer S.J. Qian S.W. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Weatherbee J.A. Tsang M.L. Lucas R. Zhang B.L. Wenker J. Torchia D.A.

Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), the WSXW sequences of the second and third TSRs are exposed and oriented so that the polar atoms of the tryptophans are available for potential ligand binding (Fig. 2A). As mentioned previously, these tryptophan-rich regions are common to all three of the TSRs of TSP1 (Table III) and TSP2 (Table IV). The sequence WSHWSPW in the second TSR of both TSP1 and TSP2 is the most conserved across species. Together, these observations suggest that the VLAL sequences in TGF-β might constitute a binding site for the WSXW sequence of TSP.Table IIIWSXW motifs in"
https://openalex.org/W2106145354,"We previously reported that thyroid hormone, 3,3′,5-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3), increased Na,K-ATPase activity of adult rat alveolar epithelial cells in a transcription-independent manner via increased cell surface expression of the α1 and β1 subunits of Na,K-ATPase. Now we sought to identify signaling molecules necessary for T3 stimulation of Na,K-ATPase activity in alveolar epithelial cells. Whereas protein kinase A inhibitor H-8 and protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolymaleimide did not block the T3-induced increase in Na,K-ATPase activity, two inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), wortmannin and Ly294002, and two Src kinase inhibitors, PP1 and PP2, blocked the T3-induced Na,K-ATPase activity. T3 stimulated the activity of PI3K as measured by phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. T3 also stimulated the serine 473 phosphorylation of the PI3K downstream molecule PKB/Akt in a dose-dependent manner. Transient expression of a constitutively active mutant of the PI3K catalytic subunit p110 augmented Na,K-ATPase activity and increased the amount of cell surface Na,K-ATPase α1 subunit protein. T3 also stimulated Src family kinase activity. Transient expression of a constitutively active Src kinase increased Na,K-ATPase activity, PI3K activity, and phosphorylation of PKB/Akt at serine 473. PP1 or PP2 blocked T3-stimulated PKB/Akt phosphorylation at serine 473 and PI3K activity that was activated by an active mutant of Src; however, wortmannin did not inhibit the T3-stimulated Src kinase activity. Although PP1 and wortmannin abolished the increase in Na,K-ATPase activity induced by the active mutant of Src, PP1 did not inhibit the active mutant of PI3K-up-regulated Na,K-ATPase activity. In summary, T3 stimulates the PI3K/PKB pathway via the Src family of tyrosine kinases, and activation of both the Src family kinases and PI3K is required for the T3-induced stimulation of Na,K-ATPase activity and its cell surface expression in adult rat alveolar epithelial cells. We previously reported that thyroid hormone, 3,3′,5-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3), increased Na,K-ATPase activity of adult rat alveolar epithelial cells in a transcription-independent manner via increased cell surface expression of the α1 and β1 subunits of Na,K-ATPase.

The integral membrane protein Na,K-ATPase is critical for maintaining cellular ion gradients across the plasma membrane and the cell volume of most animal cells (1Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C541-C566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Factor P. Ingbar D.H. J. Appl. Physiol. 2002; 93: 1860-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The accumulation of fluid in alveolar space, as occurs in the acute respiratory distress syndrome, is a life-threatening condition because the fluid impairs alveolar oxygen action. The Na,K-ATPase consists of at least two subunits (α and β), each with several isoforms. The Na,K-ATPase isoforms are expressed in a tissue- and development-specific fashion and are believed to be distinct in both function and modes of regulation (3Blanco G. Mercer R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F633-F650PubMed Google Scholar). The α1 isoform is predominant in most epithelia, including rat lung (4Ingbar D.H. Weeks C.B. Gilmore-Hebert M. Jacobsen E. Duvick S. Dowin R. Savik S.K. Jamieson J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: L619-L629Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Na,K-ATPase activity is differentially regulated in a hormone- and tissue-specific fashion (1Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C541-C566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In lung epithelial cells, some investigators have found that β-adrenergic agonists up-regulate the Na,K-ATPase activity via PKA (protein kinase A) and MAPK/ERK (mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signaling related kinase) (5Pesce L. Guerrero C. Comellas A. Ridge K.M. Sznajder J.I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 310-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In AECs, Dopamine activates Na,K-ATPase and stimulates translocation of Na,K-ATPase molecules from intracellular compartments to plasma membrane via activation of novel PKC isoforms PKC-δ and PBC-ϵ (6Ridge K.M. Dada L. Lecuona E. Bertorello A.M. Katz A.I. Mochly-Rosen D. Sznajder J.I. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In contrast, in renal epithelial cells, dopamine inhibits Na,K-ATPase activity via removal of active Na,K-ATPase molecules from the plasma membrane into early and late endosomes (7Ogimoto G. Yudowski G.A. Barker C.J. Kohler M. Katz A.I. Feraille E. Pedemonte C.H. Berggren P.O. Bertorello A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The PKC-ζ-dependent phosphorylation of the Na,K-ATPase α subunit and activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase are necessary for the dopamine-induced endocytosis of Na,K-ATPase in renal cells (7Ogimoto G. Yudowski G.A. Barker C.J. Kohler M. Katz A.I. Feraille E. Pedemonte C.H. Berggren P.O. Bertorello A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2000; 97: 6556-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Much information about the Na,K-ATPase regulation is available in several systems (1Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C541-C566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, due to the hormone- and tissue-specific regulation of Na,K-ATPase, the mechanisms regulating Na,K-ATPase enzyme activity in many tissues, including the lung, are not completely understood. Specifically, the signal transduction pathway(s) involved in short time regulation of Na,K-ATPase function are incompletely defined. Thyroid hormones regulate normal cell function and differentiation by interacting with intracellular thyroid hormone receptors, and transcriptional coregulatory factors (coactivators and corepressors) (9Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). It has recently been recognized that thyroid hormones also may rapidly generate biological responses by nongenomic mechanisms that are independent of nuclear receptors for T3 (9Yen P.M. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1097-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). The signal transduction pathways of the nongenomic effects of thyroid hormones are just beginning to be defined. Thyroid hormone (T4) recently was reported to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase in HeLa and CV-1 cells (10Lin H.Y. Davis F.B. Gordinier J.K. Martino L.J. Davis P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1014-C1024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The T3-induced activity of Na+/H+ exchanger and system A amino acid transport in chick embryo hepatocytes was blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase C and PI3K (11Incerpi S. De Vito P. Luly P. Spagnuolo S. Leoni S. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1660-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thyroid hormone differentially regulates Na,K-ATPase isoforms in both tissue- and cell type-specific manners (1Therien A.G. Blostein R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C541-C566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we reported that in AECs T3 also stimulates rapidly the enzyme activity and cell surface expression of Na,K-ATPase in a transcription-independent manner (12Lei J. Nowbar S. Mariash C.N. Ingbar D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L762-L772PubMed Google Scholar); however, the signaling transduction pathway(s) is not defined. Identifying the signal transduction molecule(s) involved in T3 nontranscriptional stimulation of Na,K-ATPase would provide insight into the molecular mechanism(s) of thyroid hormone function. To explore the signaling molecule(s) involved in the T3 effects on Na,K-ATPase, we assessed the role of several kinases in regulation of Na,K-ATPase by T3. We found that PI3K inhibitors or Src kinase inhibitors blocked the T3-induced stimulation of Na,K-ATPase activity. Transient overexpression of active mutant of Src or PI3K in the absence of T3 increased Na,K-ATPase activity and plasma membrane protein quantity. These data indicated that the activation of PI3K is required for the T3-stimulated Na,K-ATPase activity and Na,K-ATPase cell surface expression unlike the inhibitory role of PI3K in Na,K-ATPase regulation in renal cells (8Yudowski G.A. Efendiev R. Pedemonte C.H. Katz A.I. Berggren P.O. Bertorello A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6556-6561Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar).

The cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 with 5% stripped FBS for 24 h before T3 treatment. Cell Culture and Transient Transfections—The adult rat ATII-like cell line MP48 (12Lei J. Nowbar S. Mariash C.N. Ingbar D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L762-L772PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift of G. Hunninghake (University of Iowa), and another rat ATII-like cell line RLE-6TN (36Driscoll K.E. Carter J.M. Iype P.T. Kumari H.L. Crosby L.L. Aardema M.J. Isford R.J. Cody D. Chestnut M.H. Burns J.L. Leboeuf R.A. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1995; 31: 516-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) was purchased from ATCC. Both cells exhibit characteristics of alveolar type II cells, such as lipid-containing inclusion bodies. RLE-6TN cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 medium. MP48 cells were maintained in Waymouth's MB752/1 medium. Both media were supplemented with 10% FBS, 40 mm HEPES, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B). To measure the effect of T3 on the hydrolytic activity of Na,K-ATPase, MP48 cells were grown to ∼95% confluence in Waymouth's MB752/1 with 10% FBS. Then cells were cultured in Waymouth's MB752/1 medium plus stripped 1% FBS in which endogenous T3 and glucocorticoids previously were removed by mixing serum with a resin slurry (5 g of Bio-Rad AG 1-X8 resin/100 ml of serum) as described by Samuels et al. (14Samuels H.H. Stanley F. Casanova J. Endocrinology. 1979; 105: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Removal of endogenous T3 by this method was confirmed using tracer amounts of radioisotope-labeled T3. For inhibition studies, cells were preincubated with inhibitors for 30 min at 37 °C and then were treated with T3 in the continued presence of inhibitors. To detect phosphorylation of Src family kinases and PKB/Akt, the cells were starved in serum-free medium for 24 or 48 h before T3 treatment. Reactions were terminated by washing the cell monolayers twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. MP48 cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE PLUS Reagent (Invitrogen) or LipofectAMINE Reagent (Invitrogen) in 6-well plates using 1 or 2 μg of plasmid DNA per well according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were subjected to Na,K-ATPase activity assay, protein phosphorylation, and biotinylation experiments at 48 h after transfection. The constitutively active p110 subunit in vector pSG5 has been previously described (37Wennström S. Downward J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4279-4288Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The constitutively active Src kinase (Src Y527F) in pUSEamp vector was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Na,K-ATPase Activity Assay—The hydrolytic activity of Na,K-ATPase was measured as ouabain-sensitive ATP hydrolysis under Vmax conditions by measuring the release of Pi from ATP as previously described (12Lei J. Nowbar S. Mariash C.N. Ingbar D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L762-L772PubMed Google Scholar). Na,K-ATPase specific activity was calculated as the difference in Pi concentration/mg of protein/min in the absence and presence of 10 mm ouabain. Results were compared with controls and expressed as the percentage increase or inhibition of control Na,K-ATPase activity. Src Kinase Activity Assay—The Src kinase activity assay kit was purchased from Upstate Cell Signaling Solution. The assay kit is based on phosphorylation of a specific substrate peptide (KVEKIGEGTYGVVYK) using the transfer of the [γ-32P]ATP by Src kinase. The phosphotransferase activity of Src kinases was measured in immunoprecipitates according to the manufacturer's instructions. The immunoprecipitates for kinase activity assay were obtained by incubation of 200 μg of total cellular protein, 3 μg of antibody against Src family kinases, and 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads in 1× immunoprecipitation buffer at 4 °C for 3 h with gentle rocking. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1× immunoprecipitation buffer and were then washed with Src kinase reaction buffer. PI3K Activity Assay—PI3K activity was assessed by the incorporation of [32P]ATP into exogenous phosphoinositide, resulting in the production of PI(3)P as described by Ahmad et al. (15Ahmad S. Ahmad A. Gerasimovskaya E. Stenmark K.R. Allen C.B. White C.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 2003; 28: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, MP48 cells were lysed in buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1× protease inhibitor mixture, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40). The PI3K enzyme was immunoprecipitated with antiphosphotyrosine-agarose conjugate (BD Biosciences) and anti-PI3K p85 (Upstate-Cell Signaling Solutions) coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. The PI3K activity in the immunoprecipitates was assessed directly on the beads by incubating the immunoprecipitates with phosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar Lipids) and [32P]ATP in kinase buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. The lipids in the reaction mixture were then extracted by chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v) and were resolved on aluminum-backed Silica Gel 60 TCL plates by chromatography in CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2). The spots corresponding to PI(3)P were visualized by autoradiography and were quantitated by densitometry in arbitrary units using a Bio-Rad Image Analysis system (Molecular Analyst). The PI(3)P product was identified by comparing its relative mobility value with the relative mobility value of standard PI(3)P, which was visualized by exposure of TCL plates to phospholipid-specific molybdenum blue spray reagent (Sigma). Cell Lysis and Immunoprecipitation—The cells were lysed in lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin) and inhibitors of phosphatases (2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm Na3VO4). The lysate was drawn 10 times through a 25-gauge needle on ice for further lysis and then was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and the protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay kit. Immediately after this step, equal amounts of protein were subjected to Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation of p85 was performed as previously described (15Ahmad S. Ahmad A. Gerasimovskaya E. Stenmark K.R. Allen C.B. White C.W. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 2003; 28: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 16Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 425-426Google Scholar) with slight modification. Briefly, the cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer. The immunoprecipitation buffer differs from the above lysis buffer only in the concentration of Tris-HCl (50 mm for the immunoprecipitation buffer). Equal amounts of protein from each treatment were incubated with 5 μg of anti-p85 antibody and 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads in 1× immunoprecipitation buffer at 4 °C overnight with gentle rocking. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 1× immunoprecipitation buffer. Proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling for 10 min in Western blot loading buffer and then were subjected to Western blotting. Western Blot—Protein samples were boiled for 10 min in loading buffer containing 2% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.001% bromphenol blue. Proteins were then separated on a 7.5 or 10% denaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (catalog no. IPVH00010; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), which was then hybridized with primary antibodies. After incubation with a secondary peroxidase-conjugated goat antibody diluted 1:2000 (Cell Signaling Technology) and washing, proteins were detected with the ECL system (Cell Signaling Technology). The chemiluminescence of each lane was quantified by densitometry in arbitrary units using a Bio-Rad Image Analysis system (Molecular Analyst). For reuse of membranes that had been Western blotted, the antibodies on membrane were removed by incubating the membrane with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) at 37 °C for 2 h and washing five times in 1× TBST buffer. Measurement of Plasma Membrane Na,K-ATPase Protein—For determination of plasma membrane Na,K-ATPase, the cell surface proteins were biotinylated as described by Gonin et al. (17Gonin S. Deschenes G. Roger F. Bens M. Martin P.Y. Carpentier J.L. Vandewalle A. Doucet A. Feraille E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Cells grown on 6-well plates were subjected to different treatments, detached after being washed twice with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm EDTA at 4 °C for 5 min. Then cell surface proteins were biotinylated by incubating cells in biotinylation buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 1 mg/ml water-soluble, cleavable Sulfo-Biotin-X-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 4 °C. The free unreacted biotin was quenched by washing three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 mm glycine. After lysis, protein content was determined using the BCA protein assay kit. Equal amounts of total cell protein were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma) diluted in lysis buffer via incubating overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer, twice with high salt buffer (5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl), and once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Proteins were eluted from the beads by incubation of the biotinylated protein-streptavidin-agarose beads for 10 min in 50 μl of SDS-containing buffer (5.6% SDS, 240 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6% β-mercaptoethanol, 16% glycerol, and 0.008% bromphenol blue) and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. The amount of protein was expressed as densitometry in arbitrary units. Statistics—All data are expressed as mean ± S.D. of a minimum of three experiments. Comparisons involving three or more groups were analyzed by analysis of variance and post hoc pairwise comparisons. Differences between means were considered significant at p < 0.05, adjusted for the number of comparisons. Inhibitors of PI3K and Src Family Kinases, but Not PKA and PKC, Abolished the T3-induced Na,K-ATPase Activity in Alveolar Epithelial Cells—We demonstrated previously that T3 at both physiologic and pharmacological concentrations increased the Na,K-ATPase hydrolytic activity in adult rat alveolar epithelial cells, including primary ATII cells and the MP48 and RLE-6TN cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. The T3-induced increases were detected by 30 min and peaked at 6 h (12Lei J. Nowbar S. Mariash C.N. Ingbar D.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L762-L772PubMed Google Scholar). To define the signaling pathways involved, we assessed the inhibitory effects of PI3K, Src family kinases, PKA, and PKC inhibitors on T3-induced Na,K-ATPase activity. Consistent with our previous study, T3 significantly increased the Na,K-ATPase hydrolytic activity in alveolar epithelial cells at both 3 (Fig. 1, C, E, F, and G) and 6 h (Fig. 1, A–E), but the magnitude of the effect was greater at 6 h. The selective PI3K inhibitor wortmannin (10 nm) inhibited completely the T3-induced increase in Na,K-ATPase activity in primary cultures of adult rat alveolar type II cell (Fig. 1A), cell line RLE-6TN (Fig. 1B), and cell line MP48 (Fig. 1C). The structurally distinct inhibitor of PI3K, Ly294002 (25 μm), also inhibited the T3-induced Na,K-ATPase activity in MP48 cells (Fig. 1D). Since activation of PI3K by Src family kinases has been described in some cells other than AECs (41Sun M. Yang L. Feldman R.I. Sun X.M. Bhalla K.N. Jove R. Nicosia S.V. Cheng J.Q. J. Biol.

Either PP1 (1 μm) or PP2 (10 μm) blocked the T3-induced Na,K-ATPase activity in MP48 cells (Fig. 1E). Neither PI3K inhibitors nor Src kinase inhibitors alone significantly inhibited the Na,K-ATPase activity compared with control. These findings indicated that PI3K and Src family kinases were necessary for the up-regulation of Na,K-ATPase activity by T3.Fig. 1Inhibitors of PI3K and Src family kinases, but not PKA and PKC, blocked the T3-induced increase in the Na,K-ATPase hydrolytic activity in alveolar epithelial cells. Ouabain-sensitive hydrolytic activity of Na,K-ATPase was measured after permeabilization of cell membrane. The results are expressed as a percentage of controls. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01. Results are the mean ± S.D. of four independent experiments (unless otherwise stated). The impact of T3 on Na,K-ATPase is time-dependent and is greater at 6 h of T3 exposure (solid bars) than at3h(empty bars). Some experiments were performed at each time point. A, primary AT II cells were T3-starved for 24 h by culture in DMEM/F-12 with 5% stripped FBS. Cells were then incubated with 10–5m T3 for 6 h in DMEM medium with 1% stripped FBS in the presence or absence of 10 nm wortmannin. Results are the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. B, RLE-6TN cells were T3-starved for 24 h by culture in 1% stripped FBS medium for 24 h after cells grew to ∼95% confluence in DMEM/F-12 medium with 10% FBS. Cells then were exposed to 10–4m T3 for 6 h in 1% stripped FBS medium in the presence or absence of 10 nm wortmannin. C, MP-48 cells were grown to ∼95% confluence in Waymouth medium containing 10% FBS. Cells were T3-starved for 24 h by culture in 1% stripped FBS. Cells then were exposed to 10–5m T3 in 1% stripped medium for 3 h (empty bars) or 6 h (solid bars) in the presence or absence of 10 nm wortmannin. D, cell culture of MP48 and T3 stimulation for 6 h were as described in C, and the inhibitor used was 25 μm Ly294002. E, cell culture of MP48 and T3 stimulation for 3 h (empty bars) or 6 h (solid bars) were as described in C; the inhibitors used were 1 μm PP1 or 10 μm PP2. F, cell culture of MP48 and T3 stimulation for 3 h were as described in C, and the inhibitor used was 30 μm H-8. G, cell culture of MP48 and T3 stimulation for 3 h were as described in C; however, the inhibitor used was 5 μm bisindolymaleimide. In A–E, the activity in the presence of T3 and inhibitor was not significantly different from the control value. For F and G, the activity in the presence of T3 and the inhibitors H-8 or Bis, respectively, was greater than control and not different from T3 alone. In A–F, the activity with inhibitor alone was not significantly different from control, whereas in G, there was a small, but statistically significant, increase in activity in the presence of Bis alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Activation of PKA by β-adrenergic agonists (5Pesce L.

In addition, the PI3K lipid products, PI(3,4)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, are also capable of activation of the PKC (18Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

Therefore, we sought to test the roles of PKA and PKC in the T3-induced increase in Na,K-ATPase activity using the PKA inhibitor H-8 and PKC inhibitor bisindolymaleimide. H8 is a highly active inhibitor of PKA and has inhibitory effects at 10 μm in rat fetal AECs (46Niisato N. Ito Y. Marunaka Y. Am. J.

With the exception of DNA polymerase η (polη), which is defective in humans with the Xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XP-V) phenotype, little is known about the cellular function(s) of the remaining human Y-family DNA polymerases. We report here that an interaction between human DNA polymerase ι (polι) and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) stimulates the processivity of polι in a template-dependent manner in vitro. Mutations in one of the putative PCNA-binding motifs (PIP box) of polι or the interdomain connector loop of PCNA diminish the binding between polι and PCNA and concomitantly reduce PCNA-dependent stimulation of polι activity. Furthermore, although retaining its capacity to interact with polη in vivo, the polι-PIP box mutant fails to accumulate in replication foci. Thus, PCNA, acting as both a scaffold and a modulator of the different activities involved in replication, appears to recruit and coordinate replicative and translesion DNA synthesis polymerases to ensure genome integrity.

Indeed, the cellular function of human polι is particularly enigmatic given its unique enzymatic properties in vitro. Detailed biochemical analysis of the purified enzyme indicates that it exhibits up to 100,000-fold differences in the frequency of nucleotide misincorporation depending upon the template base replicated. At template T, the wobble base G is incorporated 3–11 times more often than the correct Watson-Crick base, A. However, at template A, misincorporations occur with a frequency of ∼10-4 (5Tissier A.

Unlike the related polη, which bypasses cis-syn cyclobutane thymine dimers efficiently and relatively accurately (8Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Iwai S. Hanaoka F.

In the latter three cases, the enzyme is unable to facilitate lesion bypass but instead requires assistance from another translesion DNA synthesis enzyme, such as polζ (6Johnson R.E. Washington M.T.

One appealing mechanism would be to strictly control access of the polymerase to a growing primer terminus. For the replicative polymerases, such activity is coordinated by the replicative processivity factors (prokaryotic β-clamp and eukaryotic PCNA). The process is mediated by a clamp loader (which in eukaryotes is replication factor C (RFC)), which recognizes the DNA primer terminus and opens and assembles a PCNA ring around the nascent DNA (reviewed in Ref. 14Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 236-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).

Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 574-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar) digested with NdeI-BamHI and cloned into the NdeI-BamHI sites of vectors pGBKT7 and pGADT7 (Clontech) producing plasmids pGBKT7-PCNA and pGADT7-PCNA. To generate I126A and L128A mutations in the IDCL of PCNA, the last 423 nucleotides of hPCNA cDNA were amplified with mutagenic primer PCNA3 (5′-GGA ATT CGA CGT CGA ACA AGC TGG AGC TCC AGA ACA GGA GTA CAG CTG TG-3′) and PCNA2, digested with EcoRI-BamHI and cloned into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of vector pGBKT7, generating plasmid pGBKT7-PCNA[364–786]. Next, the first 363 nucleotides of hPCNA were amplified by PCR with PCNA1 and PCNA4 (5′-GGA ATT CGA CGT CTA AAT CCA TCA ACT TCA TTT C-3′), digested with NdeI-AatII and cloned into the NdeI-AatII-digested pGBKT7-PCNA[364–786] vector to produce pGBKT7-PCNA-IDCL. pACT2-polι, pACT2-polι[1–278], pACT2-polι[1–492], pACT2-polι[492–715], pGBKT7-polι, and pGBKT7-polη were constructed as previously described (22Kannouche P. Fernández de Henestrosa A.R. Coull B. Vidal A. Gray C. Zicha D. Woodgate R. Lehmann A.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6246-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To produce pACT2-polι PIP1 (Y426A,Y427A), pACT2-polι PIP2 (F546A,F547A), and pGBKT7-polι PIP1, the EcoRI-BamHI 674-nucleotide fragment from peYFP-polι PIP1 or pEYFP-polι PIP2 was subcloned into the similarly digested pACT2-polι, pGBKT7-polι plasmids, respectively. The polι PIP3 (F710A,H711A) mutant was constructed by PCR amplification of the POLI gene with primers: 5′-GTC GGG TCA TGT ATA CAA TAA TCA G-3′ and 5′-GCG GAT CCT TAT TTA TGT CCA ATG GCG GCA TCT GAT CCT G-3′, and ligation of the AatII-BamHI-digested PCR products to the similarly digested pACT2-polι. pGBKT7-polη[484–713] was produced by PCR amplification with primers: 5′-GCA TAT GGA ATT CCA AAA AGC TGC AGA AAG-3′ and 5′-GCG GTC GAC TAA TGT GTT AAT GGC TTA AAA AAT G-3′ using pGBKT7-polη as a template. The PCR product was then digested with EcoRI-SalI and cloned into the EcoRI-SalI sites of pGBKT7.Protein Purification Constructs—To generate His-tagged PCNA and an IDCL-PCNA mutant, NdeI-BamHI fragments from the two-hybrid constructs containing full-length hPCNA and IDCL mutant were inserted into the NdeI-BamHI sites of pET16b (Novagen). The GST-polη[484–713] expression vector was produced by subcloning a 690-bp EcoRI-SalI polη fragment from pGBKT7-polη[484–713] into the EcoRISalI sites of pGEX-4T1 (Amersham Biosciences).Proteins—Glutathione S-transferase-tagged human polι was purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells as previously described (5Tissier A. McDonald J.P. Frank E.G. Woodgate R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1642-1650PubMed Google Scholar). Histidine-tagged human PCNA and IDCL-PCNA proteins were purified on Ni2+-charged nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid His-Bind Resin (Novagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. The His-PCNA containing eluates were then dialyzed against H Buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) and applied to a hydroxylapatite (Bio-Rad) column previously equilibrated with H Buffer. The column was subsequently washed with H Buffer, and the His-PCNA fusion proteins were eluted with 10 column volumes of a 10–300 mm linear gradient of potassium phosphate in H Buffer. His-PCNA containing fractions were aliquoted and stored at 80 °C.GST and GST-polη[484–713] proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Human RFC (23Podust V.N. Tiwari N. Stephan S. Fanning E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31992-31999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and RPA (24Henricksen L. Umbricht C. Wold M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were purified as previously described.In Vitro Transcription/Translation of Proteins—In vitro transcription/translation of full-length polι, polι PIP1, and PCNA was performed using a TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The expression vectors encoding the full-length polι (pGBKT7-polι), polι PIP1 (pGBKT7-polι PIP1), and PCNA (pGBKT7-PCNA) were added separately to the reaction mixtures and then incubated for 90 min at 30 °C in the presence of [35S]methionine. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and used in replication reactions and GST and Ni2+ pull-down assays.Replication Reactions—The DNA template used for the study was a circular single-stranded M13mp18 DNA (New England Biolabs) primed with a 17-mer 5′-32P-labeled oligonucleotide. 5′-CGA GAA CAA GCA AGC CG-3′ (Lofstrand Laboratories) that is complementary to base pairs 3440–3456 of M13mp18.Primer Extension Assay—In a standard reaction (final volume, 10 μl), 5 nm of the primer-template (expressed as primer termini) was incubated in reaction buffer (40 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5% glycerol, 500 μm ATP, and 100 μm of all dNTPs) with polι (2.5 nm) alone or in the presence of PCNA (50 nm) or IDCL-PCNA (50, 100, and 200 nm), RFC (2 nm), and RPA (475 nm) as indicated in the figures. The reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 5 min and terminated by mixing with one volume of formamide loading dye solution (500 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue in 90% formamide). The products were resolved by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (8 m urea, 15% acrylamide) and visualized using a FujiFilm FLA-3000 Phosphor Imager. For DNA-polymerase assays with in vitro translated proteins, TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate reactions (Promega) were diluted 1:40 in dilution buffer (25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 25% glycerol). Standard assay reactions containing 100 μm aphidicolin (Sigma) and 1 μl of the diluted protein sample were incubated 20 min at 37 °C.Replication Assays in the Presence of a DNA Trap—Reaction mixtures containing polι (5 nm) with or without PCNA, RFC, and RPA were preincubated with the circular M13 DNA template-primer in the standard reaction buffer in the absence of dNTPs at 37 °C for 5 min to preform the DNA-polymerase complex. Enzymatic reactions were started by the addition of dNTPs (100 μm) or dNTPs and an excess of competitor DNA (1 mg/ml of nonradiolabeled herring sperm DNA) to capture polι molecules that dissociated from the radiolabeled template and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. As a control, a reaction mixture containing polι, PCNA, RFC, and RPA was preincubated with an excess of DNA competitor and the DNA template prior to addition of the dNTPs.Two-hybrid Assay—The interaction between human polι and PCNA was analyzed in vivo using the Saccharomyces cerevisiae two-hybrid Matchmaker III system (Clontech). Strain AH109 was co-transformed with the GAL4 binding domain (pGBKT7-X) and GAL4 activation domain (pACT2-X, pGADT7-X) fusion constructs as indicated in the figures. Co-transformants were selected on DOBA-Trp-Leu (Bio 101) plates. Colonies were subsequently replica-plated on DOBA-Trp-Leu-His-Ade (Bio 101) plates. An interaction between the two fusion proteins resulted in the ability of the transformed yeast cells to grow in the selective medium.Ni2+Pull-down Assay—Equal amounts of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads alone or coupled to His-tagged PCNA or His-IDCL-PCNA proteins (20 μg) were mixed with 10 μl of a standard TnT-lysate reaction containing 35S-labeled polι, polι PIP1, or PCNA in 500 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of a “Complete EDTA-free” mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). After incubation for 16 h at 4 °C, the beads were washed four times with binding buffer, and the bound proteins were separated on a 4–20% SDS-PAGE. The dried gels were scanned using a FujiFilm FLA-3000 Phosphor Imager.GST Pull-down Assay—Equal amounts of GST or GST-polη[484–715] (20 μg) coupled to glutathione-agarose beads were mixed with 35S-labeled polι or polι-PIP1 (10 μl of a standard TnT lysate system reaction) in 500 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), containing Complete protease inhibitors. After incubation for 15 min at 37 °C, the beads were washed four times with binding buffer, and the bound proteins were separated on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel.Plasmids—peYFP-polι and peCFP-polη were produced in a similar way to peCFP-polι and peYFP-polη described in Ref. 22Kannouche P. Fernández de Henestrosa A.R. Coull B. Vidal A. Gray C. Zicha D. Woodgate R. Lehmann A.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6246-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar. The polι PIP1 mutant was constructed by using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the primers 5′-GAA AGG GCT TAT CGA TGC TGC TTT AAT GCC ATC ATT ATC-3′ and 5′-GAT AAT GAT GGC ATT AAA GCA GCA TCG ATA AGC CCT TTC-3′ on the plasmid template peYFP-polι (22Kannouche P. Fernández de Henestrosa A.R. Coull B. Vidal A. Gray C. Zicha D. Woodgate R. Lehmann A.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6246-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For the convenience of subsequent identification, these primers also contain a silent change that results in a novel ClaI restriction enzyme site (underlined). The polι PIP1 mutant was recloned into peYFP-C1 to produce peYFP-polι PIP1. To generate peYFP-polι PIP2, the polι gene was amplified by PCR from peYFP-polι with the following primers: 5′-CAT GCC TCT AGA GGA GTA TTA TCT GCC GCT TCT AAA AAA C-3′ and 5′-TAT GGC TGA TTA TGA TCA GTT ATC TAG ATC CGG TGG ATC C-3′ and subcloned into peYFP-polι.Transfection and Immunofluorescence—peCFP-polη and peYFP-polι were co-transfected into transformed fibroblasts (at a ratio of 1:1) using FuGENE™ 6, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science). Twenty hours after transfection, the cells were irradiated at 7 J/m2 and incubated for a further 8–12 h. Fixation of cells was carried out as previously described (22Kannouche P. Fernández de Henestrosa A.R. Coull B. Vidal A. Gray C. Zicha D. Woodgate R. Lehmann A.R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6246-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Fluorescence images of cell nuclei were acquired on a Zeiss Axiophot2 microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with an Orca ER CCD camera (Hamamatsu) using Simple PCI software. The images were captured by alternating the excitation at 440 + 12.5 and 500 + 10 nm and detection of CFP and YFP emission at 465 + 12 and 530 + 15 nm, respectively (CFP/YFP filter set; Omega). A minimum of 200 nuclei were analyzed for each cell line and treatment.Model Building Procedure—The polι peptide suspected to bind PCNA was aligned with the p21 peptide co-crystallized with PCNA (Protein Data Bank code 1AXC). To make the model complex of polι and PCNA, the graphic program ONO (25Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar) was used to substitute residues of p21 in 1AXC with those of polι based on the sequence alignment. Interestingly, residues 423–427 of polι are predicted to form a short helix corresponding to the 310 helix formed by residues 147–151 of p21. Most of the rotamers of mutated side chains were kept the same as in the original crystal structure. Side chains of Lys420 and Lys421, which replaced Gln144 and Thr145, were adjusted choosing one of the favored rotamers and manually fitted to avoid clashes.RESULTSStimulation of polι-dependent Polymerase Activity in the Presence of PCNA, RFC, and RPA—Previous studies using steady-state kinetic analysis revealed that the catalytic activity of polι is stimulated up to 150-fold in in vitro reactions containing RFC, PCNA, and RPA, yet processivity was unaltered, and polι continued to behave in a highly distributive manner (15Haracska L. Johnson R.E. Unk I. Phillips B.B. Hurwitz J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14256-14261Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).Studies on polι suggest, however, that the properties of the enzyme are especially sensitive to both the template base replicated and the sequence context in which it is located. At templates G, C, and especially T, the enzyme misincorporates nucleotides at high frequency and has difficulty in extending from the mispaired primer terminus (26Vaisman A. Tissier A. Frank E.G. Goodman M.F. Woodgate R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30615-30622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast, at template A, polι inserts the correct nucleotide, T, 25–100-fold more efficiently than it makes any other correct base pair (5Tissier A. McDonald J.P. Frank E.G. Woodgate R. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1642-1650PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore monitored DNA polymerase activity of polι by using a 7-kb circular single-stranded M13mp18 template in which the first five template bases replicated are dAs, the sixth base is dT, and the following four bases are dAs. Based upon previous biochemical analysis of polι, we expected that synthesis on the template dAs to be robust, but upon encountering template dT, the enzyme would misincorporate dGMP and, because of its reduced ability to extend the G:T mispair, would pause or might even terminate synthesis (Fig. 1). Indeed, polι alone or in the presence of various combinations of PCNA, RFC, or RPA readily extended the primer by six bases, with a strong pause opposite template dT (Fig. 1A, lanes 3–6). Quite strikingly, however, in the presence of PCNA, RFC, and RPA, replication products were up to 14 nucleotides longer (Fig. 1A, lane 7). The stimulation in activity results from more efficient elongation of the replication products, because the amount of the initial radiolabeled primer utilized remained practically identical in the presence or absence of PCNA, RFC, and RPA (63% versus 71% respectively; Fig. 1A, lane 7 versus lane 3). The effect of PCNA, RFC, and RPA on the enzymatic activity of polι is obvious when analyzing incorporation at bases past the presumed polι-generated G:T mispair at n = 6. Indeed, the percentage of n ≥ 7 elongation products increases ∼13-fold from ∼2% in the absence of PCNA, RFC, and RPA, to ∼26% in their presence. Our data therefore suggest either that polι rebinds preferentially to those substrates encircled by PCNA or that it remains on the same DNA molecule and performs more processive DNA synthesis.To examine this further, we studied the effect of PCNA on polι processivity under conditions where the polymerase might only be expected to encounter a primer-template once. To achieve this goal, the reaction mixtures containing polι alone (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 4) or polι, PCNA, RFC, and RPA (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 5) were preincubated at 37 °C in the absence of dNTPs to preform a polymerase-DNA complex. The reactions were initiated by the addition of dNTPs (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 2) or dNTPs and an excess of competitor DNA (nonradiolabeled herring sperm DNA) (Fig. 1B, lanes 4 and 5), which serves as a trap to capture polι molecules as they dissociate from the template. Fig. 1B (lane 1 versus lane 2) shows the stimulation of polι activity by PCNA, RFC, and RPA under our standard assay conditions. Preincubation in the presence of an excess of DNA competitor resulted in the trapping of all polι molecules by the cold substrate, and no DNA polymerase activity was detected (Fig. 1B, lane 3). When the competitor DNA was added after preincubation, polι alone incorporated up to six nucleotides (Fig. 1B, lane 4). In contrast, in the presence of PCNA, RFC, and RPA products up to 20 nucleotides in length were observed. Our data therefore clearly demonstrate that under the appropriate assay conditions, PCNA, RFC, and RPA substantially increase the processivity of polι.Identification of the PCNA-binding Site in polι—In the polι paralog polη, a conserved PCNA-binding motif (PIP box) (27Warbrick E. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 28Warbrick E. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) is located at the very C terminus of the enzyme and is required for the interaction with PCNA (16Haracska L. Johnson R.E. Unk I. Phillips B. Hurwitz J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7199-7206Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, the corresponding sequence in polι is absent, and the precise location of the polι PIP box remains to be elucidated. Analysis of the primary amino acid sequence of polι reveals three potential PIP boxes (identified as PIP1–3), although none of them has a perfect match to the PIP box consensus sequence, QXX(I/L/M)XXFF (27Warbrick E. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 28Warbrick E. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 997-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, A and B).Fig. 2Identification of the PCNA-binding site in polι. A, alignment of the PCNA-binding site of 7 PCNA-interacting proteins and the consensus PIP box. Highly conserved residues are boxed and colored green. The three potential PIP boxes in polι are shown and aligned below the consensus PIP. B, schematic representation of polι and various deletion derivatives, showing the localization of the conserved Y-family DNA polymerase domain (in dark blue) and the physical position of three possible PIP boxes (in green). C, deletion mapping analysis of the interaction between polι and PCNA in a two-hybrid assay. S. cerevisiae strain AH109 was transformed separately with the GAL4-AD expression vectors pACT2, pACT2-polι, pACT2-polι[1–278] (N-terminal 278 residues of polι), pACT2-polι [1–492] (N-terminal 492 residues of polι), and pACT2-polι[492–715] (C-terminal 224 residues of polι) in combination with each one of the following GAL4-BD expression vectors: pGBKT7 and pGBKT7-PCNA, as indicated. Several colonies from each transformation were grown overnight at 30 °C in selective medium, and a sample was spotted on to a DOBA-Trp-Leu-His-Ade plate and incubated at 30 °C for 3 days. D, interaction of full-length polι with amino acid substitutions in each of the potential PIP boxes. Strain AH109 was transformed with the GAL4-AD expression vectors pACT2, pACT2-polι, pACT2-polι-PIP1 [Y426A,Y427A], pACT2-polι-PIP2 [F546A,F547A], and pACT2-polι-PIP3 [F710A,H711A] in combination with each one of the following GAL4-BD expression vectors: pGBKT7, pGBKT7-PCNA, pGBKT7-polη, and pGBKT7-polη[484–713].View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To identify which of the potential PIP boxes is involved in the polι-PCNA interaction, we first used a yeast two-hybrid analysis. In these experiments, a series of polι truncations (Fig. 2B) fused to the GAL4 activation domain (GAL4-AD) and human PCNA in fusion with the GAL4 binding domain (GAL4-BD) were co-expressed in the yeast reporter strain, AH109. An interaction between the two fusion domains resulted in the ability of the transformed yeast cells to grow in selective medium in the absence of tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and adenine. As shown in Fig. 2C, only cells expressing full-length polι or the truncated form comprising the first 492 amino acids were able to grow on selective medium. In the latter case, however, the interaction with PCNA was clearly not as robust as that observed between full-length polι and PCNA. The two-hybrid results, although not definitive, tentatively mapped the PCNA-binding site between amino acids 279 and 492 (Fig. 2C). In this region, we identified a potential PIP box, PIP1 (KKGLIDYY), between polι amino acids 420 and 427. However, because the interaction between the truncated polι-[1–492] and PCNA was suboptimal, we felt compelled to further investigate the possibility that the two other potential PIP boxes of polι may nevertheless facil"

The precise contributions of repair and tolerance mechanisms to cell survival have not been previously evaluated. Here we have analyzed the cell killing effect of the two major UV light-induced DNA lesions, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4PPs), in nucleotide excision repair-deficient human cells by expressing photolyase(s) for light-dependent photorepair of either or both lesions. Immediate repair of the less abundant 6-4PPs enhances the survival rate to a similar extent as the immediate repair of CPDs, indicating that a single 6-4PP lesion is severalfold more toxic than a CPD in the cells. Because UV light-induced DNA damage is not repaired at all in nucleotide excision repair-deficient cells, proliferation of these cells after UV light irradiation must be achieved by tolerance of the damage at replication. We found that RNA interference designed to suppress polymerase ζ activity made the cells more sensitive to UV light. This increase in sensitivity was prevented by photorepair of 6-4PPs but not by photorepair of CPDs, indicating that polymerase ζ is involved in the tolerance of 6-4PPs in human cells.

DNA lesions cause cell killing and mutations if they are not adequately repaired. Exposure of cells to UV light radiation results in formation of the two most common lesions, the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) 1The abbreviations used are: CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; 6-4PP, 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone; NER, nucleotide excision repair; pol, polymerase; siRNA, short interfering RNA; TLS, translesion synthesis; XP-A, xeroderma pigmentosum A. and the 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproduct (6-4PP) at adjacent pyrimidines (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 24-30Google Scholar). These lesions inhibit DNA replication and transcription and are normally removed from the genome by nucleotide excision repair (NER) in most organisms, including humans (2Hoeijmakers J.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 366-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (3164) Google Scholar). By contrast to a cis-syn CPD, which has only a modest effect on the DNA structure, a 6-4PP induces a large structural distortion and is repaired more rapidly than a CPD by NER (3Mitchell D.L. Photochem. Photobiol. 1988; 48: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). It is becoming widely appreciated that cells have developed a mechanism to tolerate damage in their genome without removing it. NER-deficient cells, such as XP12ROSV belonging to the xeroderma pigmentosum A (XP-A) group, for example, cannot remove UV light-induced DNA damage from their genome at all; but after irradiation with a dose of 0.3 J/m2 UV-C light, which creates >104 DNA lesions with a ratio of three CPDs to one 6-4PP in the genome, 50% of the XP-A cells continue to divide and form colonies (4Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). This tolerance mechanism is known as postreplication repair. In human cells, a major mechanism for carrying out postreplication repair is translesion synthesis (TLS), which is performed by specialized DNA polymerases at the site of DNA damage (5Lehmann A.R. Mutat. Res. 2002; 509: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The gene defective in XP variants (XP-V) encodes a DNA polymerase η (pol η), which can replicate undamaged and CPD-containing templates with equal efficiency in vitro (6Masutani C. Kusumoto R. Yamada A. Dohmae N. Yokoi M. Yuasa M. Araki M. Iwai S. Takio K. Hanaoka F. Nature. 1999; 399: 700-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar, 7Johnson R.E. Kondratick C.M. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 285: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Although several DNA polymerases involved in TLS have been identified in vitro, it is still unclear which polymerase is responsible for the bypass of various types of DNA damage, including 6-4PPs in vivo. Many DNA lesions encounter replication before they are repaired in wild-type cells. Therefore, analysis of NER-deficient cells provides important information about cell death and tolerance after UV light irradiation in human cells. To understand the effects of DNA lesions and damage tolerance on cell killing, we established NER-defective human cell lines expressing photolyase(s). Photolyases recognize either CPDs or 6-4PPs and use visible light energy to repair the lesions. Although many organisms, including aplacental mammals (marsupials), possess photolyases for CPDs and/or 6-4PPs, no photolyase gene has been found in the human genome (8Yasui A. Eker A.P.M. Nickoloff J.A. Hoekstra M.F. DNA Damage and Repair: DNA Repair in Higher Eukaryotes. 2. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1998: 9-32Google Scholar, 9Wood R.D. Mitchell M. Sgouros J. Lindahl T. Science. 2001; 291: 1284-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). To differentiate between the effects of CPDs and 6-4PPs, we introduced into a XP-A cell line, XP12ROSV, a CPD photolyase gene (CPDphr) derived from a marsupial (Potorous tridactylis, rat kangaroo) and/or a 6-4PP photolyase gene (6-4PPphr) derived from a higher plant (Arabidopsis thaliana). We isolated cells showing a stable high expression of either one or both of the photolyases. Using these cell lines, we show the influence of each lesion on cell survival and the role of polymerase ζ (pol ζ) for bypass of 6-4PPs in vivo. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—XP12ROSV, an SV40-transformed cell line derived from an XP-A patient, is mutated in the XPA gene and possesses no detectable NER activity (10Satokata I. Tanaka K. Miura N. Narita M. Mimaki T. Satoh Y. Kondo S. Okada Y. Mutat. Res. 1992; 273: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. For the expression of photolyase genes in the XP-A cell line, the cDNA of a CPD photolyase gene (CPDphr) derived from the rat kangaroo P. tridactylis (11Yasui A. Eker A.P. Yasuhira S. Yajima H. Kobayashi T. Takao M. Oikawa A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6143-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and the cDNA of a 6-4PP photolyase gene (6-4PPphr) derived from A. thaliana (12Nakajima S. Sugiyama M. Iwai S. Hitomi K. Otoshi E. Kim S.T. Jiang C.Z. Todo T. Britt A.B. Yamamoto K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 638-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) were used. Because the A. thaliana gene contains putative signal sequences for transport into mitochondria and chloroplasts at the amino-terminal region, 2S. Nakajima, K. Yamamoto, and A. Yasui, unpublished data. 57 nucleotides encoding 19 amino acids from the putative start codon were deleted in the expression construct. cDNA for each gene was introduced into the vector pCY4B, which contains the cytomegalovirus enhancer, the chicken β-actin promoter, and a rabbit poly(A) signal (13Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4617) Google Scholar). Two different markers for resistance to either neomycin or blasticidin S-hydrochloride were used in the plasmid constructs. XP12ROSV cells were transfected by a lipid-mediated method using FuGENE 6 (Roche). A cell line expressing both photolyases was established by introducing 6-4PPphr into the cell line expressing CPDphr. Stable transfectants were selected in a medium containing 600 μg/ml geneticin (Sigma) for neomycin or 10 μg/ml blasticidin S-hydrochloride (Funakoshi) and isolated by the cylinder technique. The limiting dilution method was used for secondary cloning. All transfectants were maintained in medium containing 200 μg/ml geneticin and/or 2 μg/ml blasticidin S-hydrochloride. Identification of Photolyases and UV Light-induced CPDs and 6-4PPs—Antibiotic-resistant cells were trypsinized, harvested by centrifugation, and suspended in extraction buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.3 m KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor, and 0.1% Triton X-100). These cell suspensions were sonicated, an equal volume of extraction buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors, and 0.1% Triton X-100) was added, and the suspension was then centrifuged. The supernatant was used for Western blotting. Antibodies against CPDs or 6-4PPs photolyases were raised against purified recombinant proteins of each photolyase produced in Escherichia coli. Measurement of CPDs and 6-4PPs—The rate of repair of CPDs and 6-4PPs was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the monoclonal antibodies TDM-1 (specific for CPDs) and 64M2 (specific for 6-4PPs) (14Mori T. Nakane M. Hattori T. Matsunaga T. Ihara M. Nikaido O. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 54: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Cells were grown until confluent, washed twice with Hanks' buffer, and irradiated with 20 J/m2 UV light (0.87 J/m2/s at 254 nm). Irradiation was followed immediately by illumination with white fluorescent lamps at room temperature for the time indicated. The light used for illumination was a Toshiba FL20SS fluorescent light, and cells were exposed from the bottom of the dishes through a box made of transparent poly(methyl methacrylate) plate and filled with water to absorb the heat generated by the light. Other illumination conditions have been described previously (11Yasui A. Eker A.P. Yasuhira S. Yajima H. Kobayashi T. Takao M. Oikawa A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6143-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). After illumination, cells were harvested and genomic DNA was extracted using an Easy-DNA kit (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA was then treated with RNase A, extracted with phenol and phenol-chloroform, precipitated and washed with ethanol, and resuspended in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) buffer. Genomic DNA at 30 or 300 ng/ml was used to detect CPDs and 6-4PPs, respectively. UV Light Survival—Exponentially growing fibroblasts were plated at 1.5–3 × 103 cells per 100-mm Petri dish and cultured for 8–12 h. Cells were then washed twice with Hanks' buffer and irradiated with UV-C light (254 nm) at either 0.05 or 0.25 J/m2/s. Immediately after irradiation, plates were filled with Hanks' buffer and illuminated with visible light for 90 min or kept in the dark at room temperature. After illumination, the Hanks' buffer was removed and fresh medium was added. Cells were cultured for 12–14 days. Colonies were fixed and stained with 0.3% crystal violet in methanol, and the number of colonies was counted. Preparation of Short Interference RNA (siRNA) for pol ζ and Transfection—Double-stranded siRNA of 19-mer with a protruding 3′-TT sequence (total 21-mer) was synthesized and purified by a Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion). 5′-AAATGTCGGAGCCAACCTCAGCCTGTCTC-3′ and 5′-AACTGAGGTTGGCTCCGACATCCTGTCTC-3′ oligonucleotides were synthesized (Japan BioService) and then used for pol ζ siRNA synthesis. The position of siRNA corresponded to the coding region (nucleotides 9167–9185) of the pol ζ catalytic subunit REV3 gene (GenBank™ accession number AF071798) (15Lin W. Wu X. Wang Z. Mutat. Res. 1999; 433: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 2 × 105 cells per 60-mm Petri dish and cultured overnight. Cells were transfected with 2 nm siRNA for pol ζ by using OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen). After 40 h these cells were subjected to the UV light survival assay. Reverse Transcription PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells by the High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche Applied Science). cDNAs were synthesized using the First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Applied Science). The reverse transcription PCR primers were designed as 5′-CTTTCCTTACCTCTATGTGCC-3′ and 5′-TGTAGGAGGTAGGGAATATGC-3′, which amplify the coding region of polymerase ζ (nucleotides 71 to 485). Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was performed by using Light Cycler (Roche). Light-dependent Repair of UV Light-induced Lesions in Human Cells—We established human XP-A cell lines expressing either a marsupial CPD photolyase or a plant 6-4PP photolyase. The cell line expressing CPD photolyase was further transfected to produce a cell line expressing both CPD and 6-4PP photolyases. By immunofluorescence microscopy we found that >95% of the cells express either or both of the photolyases (not shown). Fig. 1 presents a Western blotting analysis showing the expression of each photolyase in the established cell lines. Using these cell lines, we analyzed the light-dependent decrease of CPDs and 6-4PPs by antibodies against each lesion (Fig. 2). Cells were irradiated with 20 J/m2 UV-C light and exposed to visible light. In cells expressing the CPD photolyase alone, the amount of CPDs decreased to ∼10% after 2 h of illumination. In contrast to CPDs, in cells expressing 6-4PP photolyase almost all 6-4PPs disappeared after 2 h of illumination. In cells expressing both photolyases, both CPDs and 6-4PPs disappeared more rapidly than in cells expressing either photolyase. 6-4PPs disappeared almost completely after 60 min, and CPDs disappeared after 2 h of light illumination as well. These data indicate that almost all CPDs and 6-4PPs are accessible to the foreign photolyases. The presence of either lesion may influence the repair of the other lesion.Fig. 2Removal of UV light-induced lesions from genomic DNA of the cells by illumination with visible light. A, XP-A/vector cells. B, XP-A/CPDphr cells. C, XP-A/6-4PPphr cells. D, XP-A/CPD-phr+6-4PPphr cells. The amounts of CPD (squares) or 6-4PP (circles) lesions relative to those of non-illuminated cells are shown. The UV light dose was 20 J/m2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Fig. 3A shows survival of UV light-irradiated cells with and without visible light illumination. The repair of each UV lesion by either photolyase contributes to survival increase. After UV light irradiation and light illumination, cells expressing both photolyases have a survival level slightly higher than that of XP-A cells expressing wild-type XPA cDNA (Fig. 3B). To compare the effects of photorepair between CPD and 6-4PP photolyases, the fluence decrement was used, which is defined as the UV light dose whose effect is annulled by light exposure and corresponds to the effect of repair on survival increase (16Harm H. Biological Effects of Ultraviolet Radiation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom1980: 84Google Scholar). The fluence decrements of the cells irradiated with 0.5 and 0.75 J/m2 are similar after the repair of CPDs and 6-4PPs (Fig. 3C). Thus, immediate repair of the less abundant 6-4PPs enhances the survival rate to a similar extent as that of CPDs, indicating that a single 6-4PP is severalfold more toxic than a CPD lesion in NER-deficient human cells. Suppression of Polymerase ζ Activity—Cells expressing each photolyase could repair one type of damage by photoreactivation, whereas the other photoproduct must be tolerated for surviving. One of the most available pathways for this damage tolerance is TLS. As for CPD, pol η can bypass CPDs with high efficiency and accuracy. In the case of 6-4PP, a previous in vitro study of translesion synthesis proposed that pol η or pol ι incorporates deoxynucleotides opposite the 3′-base of 6-4PP and that pol ζ functions as an extender at mispaired sites (17Prakash S. Prakash L. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1872-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Because CPDs and 6-4PPs are induced by UV-C light and repaired by NER in wild-type cells, it is not possible to determine which polymerase is responsible for the bypass of each lesion in vivo. To know the substrate of pol ζ in vivo, we asked which lesion of photorepair compensates the effect of pol ζ suppression by RNA interference. Therefore, siRNA designed for the suppression of pol ζ, was introduced into the photolyase-expressing cell lines. siRNA for pol ζ decreased the mRNA level of pol ζ to ∼50% of the control (Fig. 4A), and this decrease sensitized the XP-A cells with empty vector to UV-C light, indicating that pol ζ contributes to the TLS of UV light damage (Fig. 4B). Although a similar level of suppression was obtained for pol η, it did not influence the UV light resistance of the suppressed cells (not shown), suggesting that the amount of pol ζ may be very important and that it influences the UV light resistance. In cells expressing CPD photolyase (Fig. 4C), pol ζ suppression abrogated the effect of CPD photolyase, suggesting that the residual pol ζ activity is not sufficient for the efficient bypass of 6-4PPs. There was no difference in the repair rate of CPD by photolyase between siRNA-treated and -untreated cells (not shown). In contrast to CPD photolyase, the repair of 6-4PPs significantly increased the survival of the cells with pol ζ suppression (Fig. 4D). Thus, the cell-killing effect of pol ζ suppression can be compensated by 6-4PPs but not by CPD photorepair. These data show for the first time that pol ζ contributes to bypass 6-4PPs in living cells. We have established human cell lines in which either UV light-induced CPD or/and 6-4PP can be repaired by visible light illumination after UV light irradiation. Because our cell lines express high levels of either or both photolyases, we were able to analyze the effects of almost complete repair of each or both lesions at any time after UV light irradiation; this has not been possible in previous studies (18Asahina H. Han Z. Kawanishi M. Kato Jr., T. Ayaki H. Todo T. Yagi T. Takebe H. Ikenaga M. Kimura S.H. Mutat. Res. 1999; 435: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 19Chigancas V. Miyaji E.N. Muotri A.R. de Fatima Jacysyn J. Amarante-Mendes G.P. Yasui A. Menck C.F. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2458-2463PubMed Google Scholar). First of all, we found that most CPDs and 6-4PPs in human cells are accessible and are repaired by the respective foreign photolyases during illumination with visible light. Because 6-4PPs are produced predominantly in linker DNA, possibly due to the higher flexibility of linker DNA, and because CPDs are produced in nucleosome core DNA as well (20Niggli H.J. Cerutti P.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 105: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21Mitchell D.L. Nguyen T.D. Cleaver J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5353-5356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the access of repair enzymes to CPDs in the nucleosome may be hampered by the presence of core proteins (22Mitchell D.L. Brash D.E. Nairn R.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, we found that ∼90% of CPDs are repaired by CPD photolyase only within 2.5 h after UV light irradiation of 20 J/m2 (Fig. 2). Similar results have been reported in mini-chromosomes of budding yeast and are explained by the mobility of nucleosomes (23Suter B. Livingstone-Zatchej M. Thoma F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2150-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A slight movement of DNA around core proteins may expose DNA lesions and make them accessible to a repair enzyme (24Thoma F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6585-6598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Meijer M. Smerdon M.J. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The relatively slower repair of CPDs compared with that of 6-4PPs in Fig. 2D may be explained by the severalfold more CPDs produced by UV light. Although the accessibility of the NER complex to CPDs may be less than that of photolyase, we think that a major reason for the slow repair of CPDs by NER is a limited number of NER complexes for CPD repair in cells (26Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Repeated experiments show that an almost complete repair of either CPDs or 6-4PPs contribute almost equally to the increase in cell survival (Fig. 3, A and C). Supposing that the number of 6-4PPs produced by UV-C light is only about one-third of the number of CPDs (27van Hoffen A. Venema J. Meschini R. van Zeeland A.A. Mullenders L.H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), then 6-4PPs may be about three times more toxic than CPDs in human cells without NER. This contrasts with NER-defective E. coli in which repair by CPD photolyase increases survival by >10 times more than that by 6-4PP photolyase (12Nakajima S. Sugiyama M. Iwai S. Hitomi K. Otoshi E. Kim S.T. Jiang C.Z. Todo T. Britt A.B. Yamamoto K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 638-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This difference between human and E. coli cells suggests that the UV light resistance of E. coli cells depends more on the repair of CPDs than is the case for human cells. The photorepair of CPD significantly increases the cell survival of NER-deficient yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells as well (28Yasui A. Laskowski W. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. Relat. Stud. Phys. Chem. Med. 1975; 28: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), suggesting that the tolerance for UV light-induced damage in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae is similar to that in E. coli. CPD photolyases present in E. coli and yeast play an important role for UV light resistance. It would be interesting to know how the repair of CPDs or 6-4PPs by photolyase increases cell survival in NER-deficient mutants of other organisms and to determine the roles of TLS for UV light-induced damage of the organisms. This may partly explain the distribution of photolyase genes in various organisms. In vitro data have shown that several DNA polymerases contribute to bypass CPD in human cell (5Lehmann A.R. Mutat. Res. 2002; 509: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). pol η can bypass CPD with the same efficiency and accuracy as it bypasses non-damaged template, but pol η cannot bypass 6-4PP and only inserts one deoxynucleotide opposite the 3′-base of 6-4PP (29Johnson R.E. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3558-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In contrast to pol η, pol ζ can bypass CPDs with low efficiency and, although it cannot initiate the bypass of 6-4PP, it can efficiently extend from the base inserted opposite the 3′-base of 6-4PP (30Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L. Nature. 2000; 406: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). pol κ cannot insert the nucleotides opposite CPD but can promote efficient lesion bypass by extending from the nucleotides incorporated by other polymerases opposite CPD. However, unlike pol ζ, pol κ cannot extend from the nucleotides incorporated opposite 6-4PP (31Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1910-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although pol ι can bypass CPD with a reduced efficiency compared with pol η and can bypass 6-4PP as well under certain conditions (32Tissier A. Frank E.G. McDonald J.P. Iwai S. Hanaoka F. Woodgate R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5259-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), there is no report that pol ι-deficient cells exhibit UV light sensitivity. As discussed above, in the absence of NER the killing effect of 6-4PPs is similar to that of CPDs, suggesting also that a 6-4PP is more difficult to overcome than a CPD. Therefore, it is important to examine whether tolerance to 6-4PPs is present in human cells. Our data showed that the suppression of pol ζ, by siRNA increased the UV light sensitivity of NER-deficient cells. This indicates that in NER-defective cells many of the UV light lesions are tolerated by pol ζ. The repair by 6-4PP photolyase, but not by CPD photolyase, compensates the suppression of pol ζ, indicating that pol ζ is indeed involved in the tolerance of 6-4PP. This is the first evidence showing that 6-4PP is bypassed by the pol ζ-dependent translesion synthesis pathway in living cells, including yeast and human cells. Similar analysis using RNA interference to various genes involved in TLS will elucidate their substrates in vivo. In summary, we established and analyzed NER-deficient human cells expressing photolyase for either CPDs or/and 6-4PPs, and the major findings are as follows. 1) A 6-4PP is severalfold more toxic than a CPD unless it is repaired by NER. 2) The killing effect by the suppression of pol ζ after UV light irradiation is abrogated by repair with 6-4PP photolyase but not with a CPD photolyase. These data showed the importance of NER as well as TLS for the survival of UV light-irradiated human cells. Our approach will help to extend in vitro data to the analysis of living cells.

Hydrogenases (reaction H2 ↔ H– + H+ ↔ 2H+ + 2e–) play an important role in microbial energy metabolism involving molecular hydrogen. Three classes of hydrogenases can be distinguished according to the metal content of the H2-activating site: [NiFe]-hydrogenases, [FeFe]-hydrogenases (previously called [Fe]-hydrogenases or Fe-only hydrogenases) and [Fe]-hydrogenases (1Vignais P.M.

Sequence comparisons, structural data, and spectroscopic properties indicate that although these hydrogenases are phylogenetically unrelated, they possess some remarkable similarities in the molecular architecture of the active site, namely the presence of cyanide and/or carbon monoxide as ligands to the metals. [FeFe]-hydrogenases are restricted to anaerobic bacteria and lower eukaryotes, whereas [NiFe]-hydrogenases are the dominant hydrogenases in Archaea and bacteria, including aerobic organisms. The [Fe]-hydrogenases (H2-forming methylenetetrahydromethanopterin dehydrogenase) are found in many methanogenic Archaea (6Afting C. Hochheimer A. Thauer R.K. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 169: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In their active state the [FeFe]-hydrogenases are rapidly and irreversibly denatured by oxygen (7Adams M.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1020: 115-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Most [NiFe]-hydrogenases are reversibly inactivated by oxygen, whereas the [Fe]-hydrogenases are not affected by oxygen (3Lyon E.J. Shima S. Buurman G. Chowdhuri S. Batschauer A. Steinbach K. Thauer R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Most hydrogenases are inhibited by carbon monoxide. A few [NiFe]-hydrogenases can function in air and are insensitive to carbon monoxide. Such O2- and CO-insensitive [NiFe]-hydrogenases are of great biotechnological interest in relation to their potential use in fuel cells (8Jones A.K. Sillery E. Albracht S.P.J. Armstrong F.A. Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2002; : 866-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The best studied example of this group is the cytoplasmic soluble NAD+-reducing [NiFe]-hydrogenase (SH) 2The abbreviations used are: SH, soluble NAD+-reducing hydrogenase; BV, benzyl viologen.2The abbreviations used are: SH, soluble NAD+-reducing hydrogenase; BV, benzyl viologen. from the β-proteobacterium Ralstonia eutropha H16. This is a heterotetrameric enzyme with subunits HoxF (67 kDa), HoxH (55 kDa), HoxU (26 kDa), and HoxY (23 kDa) (9Schneider K. Piechulla B.

The HoxFU dimer constitutes an enzyme module, termed NADH dehydrogenase or diaphorase, involved in the reduction of NAD+ and holds one FMN group (called FMN-b) and several Fe-S clusters. The HoxHY dimer forms the hydrogenase module and contains a second functional FMN group (FMN-a) (12Van der Linden E. Faber B.W. Bleijlevens B. Burgdorf T. Bernhard M. Friedrich B. Albracht S.P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). All [NiFe]-hydrogenases minimally consist of two subunits of different size (1Vignais P.M. Billoud B. Meyer J.

The larger subunit accommodates the active Ni-Fe site. The smaller subunit contains at least one [4Fe-4S] cluster, called the proximal cluster as it is situated close to the active site. In many enzymes the latter subunit harbors two more clusters. The Desulfovibrio gigas enzyme contains a second [4Fe-4S] cluster (distal) and a [3Fe-4S] cluster (medial) situated between the two [4Fe-4S] clusters (14Volbeda A. Charon M.H. Piras C.

The SH of R. eutropha belongs to a subclass of [NiFe]-hydrogenases where the polypeptide of the small hydrogenase subunit (HoxY) ends shortly after the position of the fourth Cys residue coordinating the proximal cluster. The large hydrogenase subunit (HoxH) of the SH contains the four Cys residues, conserved in all [NiFe]-hydrogenases, for the binding of the Ni-Fe site. Thus, on this basis it has been assumed that the hydrogenase module in the SH may contain a Ni-Fe site and a proximal cluster as prosthetic groups (10Tran-Betcke A. Warnecke U. Böcker C. Zaborosch C. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2920-2929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition it was proposed that the flavodoxin fold, which is conserved in the small subunits of all [NiFe]-hydrogenases (25Albracht S.P.J. Hedderich R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), binds the FMN-a group (12Van der Linden E. Faber B.W. Bleijlevens B. Burgdorf T. Bernhard M. Friedrich B. Albracht S.P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 801-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The aerobically purified enzyme is inactive, but is activated upon reduction. Infrared spectra and chemical analyses of the SH indicated that the Ni-Fe site contains four CN ligands (see Fig. 1B) and may be a (R,S)2(CN)(O)Ni(μ-R,S)2Fe(CN)3(CO) center (R = Cys) (21Happe R.P.

X-ray absorption spectroscopic studies showed that the nickel K-edge structure and the nickel-extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectra differ considerably from those of standard hydrogenases. They pointed to the presence of more hard ligands (N, O) to nickel in the SH than found in standard hydrogenases. Hence, it has been proposed that one or more of the conserved Cys thiols in the HoxH subunit may not be directly coordinated to nickel (27Gu Z.J. Dong J. Allan C.B. Choudhury S.B. Franco R.

Biosynthesis of the unique Ni-Fe active site is a protein-assisted process. Although we are far from understanding the molecular details of the maturation, advanced studies on hydrogenase-3 of Escherichia coli provided the following model (29Blokesch M. Böck A. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 30Reissmann S. Hochleitner E. Wang H. Paschos A. Lottspeich F. Glass R.S. Böck A. Science. 2003; 299: 1067-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Assembly of the Ni-Fe active site requires the participation of at least six accessory proteins, the so-called Hyp proteins (HypA, HypB, HypC, HypD, HypE, and HypF). First the Fe(CN)2(CO) group is assembled on a HypC-HypD complex in concert with HypF and HypE, which provides the CN ligands and possibly also CO, using carbamoylphosphate as the substrate. After the transfer of the Fe(CN)2(CO) group to the hydrogenase apoprotein, nickel insertion is mediated by HypA and HypB, and finally a specific endopeptidase removes a C-terminal peptide, thereby triggering the final folding around the Ni-Fe active site and the oligomerization of the protein. A few bacteria, interestingly those that metabolize H2 under aerobic conditions, harbor an additional hyp gene, called hypX. These species belong to various phylogenetic groups. Three of them (R. eutropha, Ralstonia metallidurans, and Pseudomonas fluorescens) are members of the β-proteobacteria, and three other species belong to the group of α-proteobacteria (Bradyrhizobium japonicum, Rhizobium leguminosarum, and Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum). Two more species are phylogenetically distinct. Streptomyces avermitilis, a Gram-positive bacterium, and Aquifex aeolicus, a hyperthermophilic bacterium. One particular feature, however, is common to all the eight species. They are strictly respiratory, preferentially aerobic, organisms. So far, the hypX gene has not been found in strictly anaerobic organisms. Deletion of hypX led to a complete knock-out of hydrogenase activity in R. leguminosarum (31Rey L. Fernandez D. Brito B. Hernando Y. Palacios J.M. Imperial J. RuizArguëso T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 252: 237-248PubMed Google Scholar) and decreased the MBH and SH activity of R. eutropha by ∼50% (32Buhrke T. Friedrich B. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The H2 sensor in R. eutropha remained unaffected (33Buhrke T. Bleijlevens B. Albracht S.P.J. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7087-7093Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The present study describes that hypX-mutant cells of R. eutropha showed a retarded growth on H2 under standard aerobic conditions, demonstrating that the oxygen tolerance of the SH requires the function of HypX. The purified SH from the hypX-deletion strain did not contain the nickel-bound CN present in enzyme from HypX-containing cells, suggesting that this CN ligand is important for the oxygen tolerance. Construction of R. eutropha HF480 —The mobilizable plasmid pCH630 containing hypXΔ was transferred from E. coli S17-1 to R. eutropha HF359 (hoxGΔ) by a spot mating technique (34Simon R. Priefer U. Pühler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 717-743Crossref Scopus (5562) Google Scholar). Gene replacement in R. eutropha was achieved by using an allelic exchange procedure based on the conditionally lethal sacB gene (35Lenz O. Schwartz E. Dernedde J. Eitinger M. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4385-4393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting isolates were screened for the presence of the desired deletion in hypX by PCR amplification of the respective target site (36Bernhard M. Schwartz E. Rietdorf J. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4522-4529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Deletioncarrying isolates were identified on the basis of the altered electrophoretic mobility of the amplification products. The resulting strain was named HF480 (hoxGΔ hypXΔ) (see summary in Table I).Table IStrains and plasmidsStrain or plasmidRelevant characteristicsSource or referenceR. eutrophaH16wild type, SH+ MBH+ HypX+DSM428, ATCC 17699HF359SH+ MBH- HypX+ (hoxGΔ)36Bernhard M.

Gerischer U. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) under an atmosphere of H2,O2, and CO2 as specified under “Results.” For the isolation of the SH, R. eutropha strains were heterotrophically grown in fructose-glycerol minimal medium (37Schwartz E. Gerischer U. Friedrich B. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3197-3204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a 50-liter BIOSTAT D fermentor (Braun, Melsungen, Germany) at 30 °C under hydrogenase-derepressing conditions. The cells were harvested at an OD436 of 11, washed with potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0), rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C. Purification of the SH—Cell-free extracts from R. eutropha cells (45-g wet weight) were prepared as described earlier (38Friedrich B. Heine E. Finck A. Friedrich C.G. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 1144-1149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SH was obtained by fractionated (NH4)2SO4 precipitation (35–60% saturation) followed by ion-exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sephacel column (20 × 180 mm, Whatman) as described in Ref. 39Schneider K. Schlegel H.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 452: 66-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar. The subsequent protocol was modified as follows. Fractions with high NAD+-reducing activity derived from the DEAE column were pooled and concentrated by (NH4)2SO4 precipitation (60% saturation). Precipitated proteins were resuspended in 3 ml of potassium phosphate buffer (200 mm, pH 7.0), and the sample was applied to a phenyl-Sepharose-6 fast-flow HP column (35 × 100 mm, Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), two bed volumes of 200 mm and two volumes of 50 mm. The enzyme was eluted with three volumes of 10 mm of the same buffer. Fractions of 6-ml were collected, and the homogeneity of the SH in fractions with high NAD+-reducing activity was further analyzed by SDS-PAGE with subsequent Coomassie staining. Fractions with an appropriate homogeneity were combined and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Centriprep 50, Millipore). The sample was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –70 °C. In the rest of the text, the SH purified from strain HF359 (hoxGΔ) is named SH(HypX+), and the SH purified from strain HF480 (hoxGΔ hypXΔ) is named SH(HypX–). Activity Measurements—Routinely, hydrogenase activities and the influence of O2 were measured at 30 °C in a 2.1-ml cell with a Clark electrode (type YSI 5331) for the polarographic measurement of H2 (40Coremans J.M.C.C. Van der Zwaan J.W. Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 997: 256-267Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For activity under aerobic conditions, the cell was filled with aerobic buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), 5–10 μl of enzyme, and H2-saturated water to a final H2 concentration of 36 μm. Subsequently, NADH (5 μm) was added to activate the enzyme, followed by either benzyl viologen (BV) (2.5 mm) or NAD+ (5.0 mm). When anaerobic conditions were required, all solutions were flushed with argon before use, and glucose (50 mm) plus glucose oxidase (9 units/ml) were added to the reaction medium 3 min before the NADH addition. This minimized interference of oxygen. To measure the CO sensitivity of the enzyme, activity was measured spectroscopically at room temperature. The assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) was flushed with H2 gas. To 2 ml of this buffer in a septum-sealed cuvette, enzyme (∼10 nm) was added plus a small amount of NADH (5 μm) to activate the enzyme. Subsequently, 0.5 ml of argon- or CO-flushed buffer was added, after which argon-flushed solutions of either BV (4.2 mm,E0′=–359 mV) or the physiological redox partner NAD+ (1.0 mm) was supplied as electron acceptors. NADH formation was measured with a Zeiss M4 QIII spectrophotometer, monitoring the increase in absorption at 340 nm (ϵ = 6.22 mm–1 cm–1). Reduction of BV was monitored at 640 nm, rather than on its absorbance maximum (ϵ = 10,000 mm–1 cm–1 at 555 nm). Before use, H2 was passed over a palladium catalyst (Degussa, Hanau, Germany; type E236P), and argon was passed through an Oxisorb cartridge (Messer-Griesheim, Düsseldorf, Germany) to remove residual O2. Fourier-transform Infrared Spectra—Fourier-transform infrared spectra were collected as before (23Pierik A.J. Roseboom W. Happe R.P. Bagley K.A. Albracht S.P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3331-3337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A fitting of infrared spectra was performed with a minimal set of Gaussian functions using GRAMS software (Galactic Ind. Corp.). Miscellaneous—Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 100: 201-220Google Scholar). The nickel and cyanide content of the preparations was determined as described (23Pierik A.J. Roseboom W. Happe R.P. Bagley K.A. Albracht S.P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3331-3337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The spin concentration calculated from the EPR signal of the [2Fe-2S]1+ cluster in reduced enzyme (1 bar H2 for 45 min at 30 °C) was used as a measure for the enzyme concentration (42Albracht S.P.J. Van der Linden E. Faber B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1557: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Effect of Deletion of hypX on Lithoautotrophic Growth—The doubling time of R. eutropha H16 wild type under lithoautotrophic conditions is 3.8 h. The deletion of hypX led to a slight increase in the doubling time to 4.4 h (32Buhrke T. Friedrich B. Arch. Microbiol. 1998; 170: 460-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To investigate whether HypX is of physiological relevance to R. eutropha, and more specifically to the functioning of the soluble hydrogenase, we introduced a hypX deletion into a strain impaired in the MBH genes. Cells of the resulting double mutant were grown lithoautotrophically with CO2 as the carbon source and H2 as the energy source, in the presence of either 5 or 15% O2. The SH-supported growth was severely affected by the hypX mutation in comparison to the HypX-containing control strain (Fig. 2). Thus, growth of the SH-containing HypX-deletion mutant was significantly delayed and only slowly started after a long lag phase (40–60 h) depending on the oxygen-partial pressure. The doubling time increased (Fig. 2) from 3.8 h in the control strain to 53 h (5% O2) or 66 h (15% O2). Normal oxygentolerant growth was restored by genetic complementation with hypX (data not shown). These experiments demonstrated that the absence of the HypX protein severely affects the physiological function of the soluble [NiFe]-hydrogenase under aerobic conditions. Infrared Spectra of the SH Purified from the hypX-deletion Mutant—To investigate the SH that is from the hypX deletion strain in more detail, the SH was purified from cells of mutant HF480 (SH(HypX–)) cultivated heterotrophically under hydrogenase-derepressing conditions. Purified SH(HypX+) was used as control in the following experiments. Infrared spectra of the as-isolated enzyme preparations are shown in Fig. 3I. As expected from previous studies (26Van der Linden E. Burgdorf T. Bernhard M. Bleijlevens B. Friedrich B. Albracht S.P.J. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 2004; 9: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 43Happe R.P. Roseboom W. Egert G. Friedrich C.G. Massanz C. Friedrich B. Albracht S.P.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the oxidized SH(HypX+) enzyme (Fig. 3I, A) showed an intense absorption band at 1956 cm–1 because of the stretching vibration of a CO coordinated to the active site iron. A reasonable fit of the peaks in the cyanide region of the spectrum (2120–2050 cm–1) was obtained with four peaks at 2098 (18%), 2088 (28%), 2080 (32%), and 2070 (22%) cm–1. Because of the asymmetry of the experimental band at 2080 cm–1, the fit improved by adding a small band at 2077 cm–1, resulting in a fit with five peaks at 2098 (18%), 2088 (30%), 2081 (20%), 2077 (12%), and 2070 (20%) cm–1. The CN band at 2098 cm–1 of the oxidized SH(HypX+) was absent in the spectrum of the SH(HypX–) mutant enzyme (Fig. 3I, B). A three-peak fit gave bands at 2087 (28%), 2081 (41%), and 2070 (31%) cm–1. The asymmetry of the experimental band at 2081 cm–1 was better reproduced by adding a small fourth peak at 2077 cm–1, resulting in a fit with four peaks at 2087 (29%), 2081 (37%), 2077 (3%), and 2070 (31%) cm–1. The positions and the relative intensities of these bands are very similar to those present in spectra of the control (Fig. 3I, A), except for the missing 2098 cm–1 band. Treatment of the enzyme preparation with oxidizing agents like oxygen or 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol did not alter this spectrum. A reduction of the SH(HypX–) during a redox titration did not result in shifts of any of the bands (Fig. 3II), whereas in wild-type enzyme the 2098 cm–1 band shifted to 2090 cm–1 at –316 mV, and subsequently to 2051 cm–1 at –516 mV (not shown). Likewise, incubation under H2 in the presence of 10 μm NADH did not induce any changes in the IR spectrum of SH(HypX–). These properties are consistent with the conclusion that the nickel-bound cyanide is missing in the SH purified from the hypX-mutant cells. A characteristic feature of standard [NiFe]-hydrogenases is their sensitivity to CO. Carbon monoxide binds to nickel and competes with H2 for binding at the active site (19Bagley K.A.

Acta. 1976; 452: 66-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 46Schneider K. Cammack R. Schlegel H.G. Hall D.O. Biochim. Biophys.

To see whether the SH(HypX–) enzyme behaves differently, the hydrogen-reduced sample was incubated with 1 bar of CO for 30 min. No differences in the infrared spectra were observed (data not shown). The lack of an extra peak originating from added CO indicates that it does not bind to the active site, neither in the wild-type enzyme nor in the SH(HypX–) mutant enzyme. This was in agreement with the lack of CO inhibition in activity measurements (data not shown). Chemical Determination of Cyanide—To determine whether the lack of one absorption band assigned to the nickel-bound CN group in the SH(HypX–) enzyme (Fig. 3I, B) correlates with a decreased level of cyanide, the mutant SH was subjected to a chemical analysis for cyanide (23Pierik A.J. Roseboom W. Happe R.P. Bagley K.A. Albracht S.P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3331-3337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The SH(HypX–) enzyme contained 2.9 cyanides/nickel (determined by atomic-absorption spectrometry). As controls the SH from R. eutropha H16 and the standard [NiFe]-hydrogenase from Allochromatium vinosum were used, and those yielded values of 3.7 and 1.9 cyanides/nickel, respectively (26Van der Linden E.

Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 5Kelly D.P. Scarpulla R.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar). Although Mtf1 structurally resembles RNA methyltransferases (6Schubot F.D. Chen C.J. Rose J.P. Dailey T.A. Dailey H.A. Wang B.C. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1980-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), functionally Mtf1 acts very much like bacterial RNAP sigma factors in that it associates with Rpo41 prior to DNA binding and dissociates after a short transcript is made (7Mangus D.A. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26568-26574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also like sigma factors, Mtf1 appears to be important for promoter opening, based on the identification of Mtf1 mutations that result in altered promoter utilization in the context of the holo-RNAP, and the ability to correct these defects by supercoiling the DNA template (8Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2101-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Karlok M.A. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28143-28149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, our recent description of a mutation in Rpo41 with promoter utilization defects that also can be corrected by supercoiling (10Matsunaga M. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2012-2019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) leaves open the possibility that the interactions of Mtf1 with Rpo41 may act to reveal the intrinsic ability of the core RNAP to recognize and initiate from mitochondrial promoters. In support of this idea, Rpo41 alone possesses some DNA sequence specificity, recognizing a non-selective template consisting of alternating AT residues but not any homopolymer sequences (11Levens D. Lustig A. Rabinowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 1474-1481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This simple template has some similarity to the mitochondrial consensus promoter/initiation site, ATATAAGTA, with the last A representing the +1 nucleotide (nt) of the transcript (12Christianson T. Rabinowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14025-14033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this work we have used a highly purified recombinant form of the yeast mitochondrial RNAP to ask whether the core RNAP alone possesses selective transcription activity. We have found that Rpo41 alone is capable of promoter recognition and initiation in the absence of Mtf1, if the template is fully or partially melted open. Mtf1 therefore is critical for open promoter formation but not promoter sequence recognition. Transcription Templates—Linear and supercoiled plasmid DNA templates containing the 14 S rRNA (pJJ1305) and tRNAcys (pJJ1110) promoters used in this study were as described previously (9Karlok M.A. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28143-28149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Linear and bubble 70-bp 14 S rRNA and no promoter templates were constructed by annealing the following oligonucleotides (5′ to 3′): 14 S rRNA linear, ccggaattcattaataatttatttattattatataagtaataaataatagttttatataataagaattcc and ccggaattcttattatataaaactattatttattacttatataataataaataaattattaatgaattcc; 14 S rRNA bubble, ccggaattcattaataatttatttattattatatgcagcttaaataatagttttatataataagaattcc and ccggaattcttattatataaaactattatttattacttatataataataaataaattattaatgaattcc; no promoter bubble, cggaattcattaataatttatttattattgcagttgtgataaataatagttttatataataagaattcc and ccggaattcttattatataaaactattatttatgcttgagctaataataaataaattattaatgaattcc. Pairs of oligonucleotides were incubated and heated to 94 °C for 5 min and sequentially cooled down 5 °C per min from 90 to 30 °C in a thermalcycler. Annealed templates were checked by gel electrophoresis and by sensitivity to S1 nuclease (MBI Fermentas). Purification of Recombinant Rpo41 and Mtf1—Expression of (His)6-tagged Rpo41 (His-Rpo41) in Escherichia coli was as described previously (10Matsunaga M. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2012-2019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Purification of His-Rpo41 used for Fig. 1A was by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) chromatography as described (13Matsunaga M. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 35: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Purification of His-Rpo41 used for all other figures was by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid and Mono Q HR 10/10 (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography essentially as described (9Karlok M.A. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28143-28149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of glutathione S-transferase-tagged Mtf1 was as described (13Matsunaga M. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 35: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Selective Transcription Assays—Promoter selective transcription reactions were as described previously (10Matsunaga M. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2012-2019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The reactions contained 100 μm [α-32P]UTP (2500–3000 cpm/pmol UTP). The products of transcription reactions were analyzed on a 6 m urea, 15% polyacrylamide gel for Fig. 1A and 7 m urea, 20% polyacrylamide gels for the other figures. Products were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), and transcript abundance was quantitated using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Rpo41 Alone Can Initiate from a Supercoiled Template—To explore the possibility that Rpo41 might be able to utilize promoters on its own, we used an Mtf1-free, recombinant form of the RNAP (13Matsunaga M. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 35: 126-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) in in vitro transcription reactions with two different mitochondrial promoter templates: the consensus 14 S rRNA promoter and the variant tRNAcys promoter as shown in Fig. 1A. We varied the standard reaction conditions (14Mangus D.A. Jaehning J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 57-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by increasing the amount of Rpo41 and the reaction time and testing both linear and supercoiled forms of the DNA template in reactions lacking CTP (–CTP). Transcription by Rpo41 from linear or supercoiled templates required the presence of a functional promoter (Fig. 1B, Vector), and on linear templates, Mtf1 was essential for selective initiation (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 3). However, core Rpo41 alone was capable of selective initiation from supercoiled but not linear forms of both promoters (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 3 and 4). The appearance of the correct 107- and 38-nt –CTP transcripts from the 14 S rRNA and tRNAcys promoters is proof that Rpo41 is capable of promoter recognition and initiation without Mtf1. Therefore, like its phage relatives, the amino acids of this single polypeptide RNAP can create the contacts necessary for initiation. Use of a Preopened, Bubble Template Obviates the Need for Mtf1—Because supercoiled templates reduce the energy required for promoter opening (15deHaseth P.L. Helmann J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), the requirement for Mtf1 on linear, but not supercoiled, templates supports the idea that Mtf1 is important for promoter melting (9Karlok M.A. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28143-28149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, on supercoiled templates Mtf1 still stimulates transcript production by a factor of 5–18 (Fig. 1B, note that there is a factor of 5 more Rpo41 present in the –Mtf1 reactions). To ask if this Mtf1 stimulation reflected the residual problems of Rpo41 with promoter opening, we created a preopened, “bubble” template (mismatched from –4 to +2) based on the 14 S rRNA promoter and used it in in vitro transcription reactions with Rpo41 –/+ Mtf1 (Fig. 2A). We compared transcription from the open bubble template to that on an equal sized linear template containing the 14 S rRNA promoter (linear) and a similar bubble template lacking any promoter sequence (control). Using equal amounts of Rpo41 in all reactions, we observed no transcription from the control template lacking a promoter or from the linear template in the absence of Mtf1 (Fig. 2B). However, transcription by Rpo41 alone from the bubble template was robust, a factor of 5 greater than the amount from the linear template with Mtf1 (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 3 and 6). We obtained similar results with linear and bubble templates based on the tRNAcys promoter sequence (data not shown). Therefore, Mtf1 is necessary for opening linear templates, and stimulates expression from supercoiled DNA, but is not required for selective recognition of promoters. This behavior is very different from the core bacterial RNAP, which can also initiate from preopened templates, but does not require a promoter sequence for this activity (16Aiyar S.E. Helmann J.D. deHaseth P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13179-13184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mtf1 Inhibits Rpo41 Activity on a Preopened Template—We observed that addition of Mtf1 to Rpo41 on the supercoiled and bubble templates actually appeared to inhibit transcription (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 2 and Fig. 2B, compare lanes 5 and 6). To explore the mechanism for this inhibition we measured Rpo41 transcript production from the linear and bubble templates in response to increasing amounts of Mtf1. As shown in Fig. 3, increasing Mtf1 stimulated transcription by Rpo41 on the closed, linear form of the 14 S rRNA promoter but repressed transcription from the premelted template. Both effects were maximal at a 1:1 ratio of core RNAP to factor. The inhibition was not caused by nonspecific binding of Mtf1 to DNA; we obtained similar results when the order of addition of components was changed to add Mtf1, rather than Rpo41, to the reaction last (data not shown). Inhibition by Mtf1 Is Due to a Decrease in Productive Relative to Abortive Transcripts—Inhibition of transcription by Mtf1 on the preopened template could be due to direct effects on initiation at the level of first bond formation or promoter escape. We found that addition of a dinucleotide primer to the Mtf1-inhibited Rpo41 reaction on the bubble template did not restore transcription (data not shown), indicating that the inhibition does not seem to be at the level of first bond formation. We therefore analyzed both the full-length and truncated reaction products to ask if the inhibitory effect was at the level of promoter escape. Failure to escape leads to the production of short abortive transcripts, in the range of 2–10 nt for the phage and bacterial RNAPs (17McClure W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5634-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 18Martin C.T. Muller D.K. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3966-3974Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Escape into elongation is accompanied by major conformational changes for both RNAPs, and for the bacterial RNAP, changes in the interaction with sigma factor (19Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A. Science. 2002; 298: 1387-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 20Murakami K.S. Darst S.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Mtf1 is released after a short RNA chain is synthesized (7Mangus D.A. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26568-26574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), presumably also marking this transition. We therefore considered transcripts of ≤10 nts to be abortive transcripts as shown in Fig. 4A. When Mtf1 was added to Rpo41 on a premelted 14 S rRNA promoter template we observed that the ratio of abortive to full-length transcripts increased by more than a factor of 10 (Fig. 4, A and B). Therefore, when Rpo41 is engaged on a preopened promoter, Mtf1 inhibits the ability of the core RNAP to escape into productive elongation. This could be due to stabilization of the initiating form of Rpo41 or to direct contacts between Mtf1 and DNA increasing the open promoter complex stability and impeding escape. The Role of Accessory Factors in Mitochondrial Transcription—These results leave open the role of Mtf1 (or its mtTFB homologues in mammalian systems (21McCulloch V. Seidel-Rogol B.L. Shadel G.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1116-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 22Falkenberg M. Gaspari M. Rantanen A. Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Gustafsson C.M. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar)) in mitochondrial transcription. It is clearly important for promoter melting, making it critical in vivo due to the linear physical form of many mitochondrial genomes (23Bendich A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 564-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The promoter melting function of Mtf1 may result from direct contacts with DNA; Mtf1 has been reported to associate relatively nonspecifically with DNA on its own (24Riemen G. Michaelis G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the association of Mtf1 with Rpo41 could cause changes in Rpo41 structure to facilitate promoter opening. In this regard it is interesting that Rpo41 does possess amino acid sequences related to the specificity loop and β-hairpin regions of T7 RNAP used for forming and stabilizing the open promoter (10Matsunaga M. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2012-2019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 25Cheetham G.M. Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 80-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In fact, interactions between Mtf1 and Rpo41 actually occur within these same regions of the core RNAP (26Cliften P.F. Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7013-7023Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Perhaps these interactions reorganize the structure of Rpo41 to recreate the ability of the core RNAP to open DNA like its phage relative. Mtf1/Rpo41 interactions also occur in the region similar to the RNA exit channel of T7 RNAP (10Matsunaga M. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2012-2019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 19Yin Y.W. Steitz T.A.

Nature. 2002; 420: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) in such a way that Mtf1 may, like sigma factor (28Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), be displaced from the core RNAP by the growing RNA chain. Competition between bound Mtf1 and the exiting RNA may explain the Mtf1-dependent increase in abortive initiation that we observed on premelted templates. Our results raise another fundamental question: if the core mitochondrial RNAP has retained the intrinsic promoter utilization properties of its phage homologue, why do all the single subunit mitochondrial RNAPs require additional specificity/stimulatory factors? The activity of T7 RNAP is regulated during the phage life cycle through interactions with T7 lysozyme that alter several aspects of initiation including affinity for nucleotides and open complex stability (29Jeruzalmi D. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4101-4113Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 30Stano N.M. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16136-16143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We speculate that similarities between the Rpo41/Mtf1 and the T7 RNAP/T7 lysozyme interactions (10Matsunaga M. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2012-2019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) link the separable factor(s) to an as yet uncharacterized regulation of mitochondrial transcription.

Immediate-early host responses to potentially harmful microbial challenges depend on innate immunity, whereas adaptive immune responses come into play later.

Here, we used complementation of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells or murine embryonic TLR2-/- fibroblasts with murine and human TLR2 to identify and analyze species specificity of pattern recognition through TLR2 ortholog products. In addition, we analyzed the murine RAW264.7 cell line, as well as human MonoMac6 and THP1 macrophage cell lines. Our results reveal species-specific recognition of a tri-lauroylated peptide through murine TLR2 and involvement of a relatively low conserved LRR-rich subdomain of the TLR2ECD in this process. Reagents—Purified bacterial components applied were LPS from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 (Sigma), soluble peptidoglycan from Staphylococcus aureus retinoblastoma prepared by vancomycin affinity chromatography (23Dziarski R. Tapping R.I. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8680-8690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and highly purified lipoteichoic acid from S. aureus prepared by propanol extraction (24Morath S. Geyer A. Hartung T. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 393-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Synthetic mycoplasmal macrophage-activating lipoprotein-2 was from Dr. Mühlradt (GBF Braunschweig, Germany), whereas tri-/di-/mono-palmitoyl-cysteinylseryl-(lysyl)3-lysine (P3CSK4, P2CSK4, PCSK4) and tri-lauroyl/tri-myristoyl-cysteinyl-seryl-(lysyl)3-lysine (Lau3/Myr3CSK4), as well as biotinoylated analogs, were purchased from ECHAZ microcollections (Tübingen, Germany) (25Bessler W.G. Jung G. Res. Immunol. 1992; 143 (discussion 579-580): 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Lipidated OspA, a tri-palmitoylated lipoprotein from Borrelia burgdorferi, was from Dr. Dunn (Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY), and highly purified recombinant chlamydial heat shock protein 60 was from Drs. Prazeres da Costa and Miethke (15Costa C.P. Kirschning C.J. Busch D. Durr S. Jennen L. Heinzmann U. Prebeck S. Wagner H. Miethke T. Eur. J.

Rabbit polyclonal antisera against phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 were from New England Biolabs (Frankfurt, Germany). Cell Culture—HEK293 cells (ATCC305) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (Invitrogen, Auckland, Scotland), whereas for culture of primary murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), 10 μm monothioglycerol (Sigma) was added to these medium components. MEFs were prepared from TLR2-/- mice (Tularik, South San Francisco, CA) as described (26Meng G. Grabiec A. Vallon M. Ebe B. Hampel S. Bessler W. Wagner H. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39822-39829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Murine RAW264.7 (ATCC No.TIB71) cells, as well as human MonoMac6 (ATCC124) and THP1 (ATCC16) cells, were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented as described for Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), whereas nonessential amino acids and media supplement (OPI, Sigma) were added for culture of MonoMac6 cells specifically. Mutagenesis—A human and a murine TLR2 expression plasmid (pFlag-CMV, Sigma) (27Heine H. Kirschning C.J. Lien E. Monks B.G. Rothe M. Golenbock D.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 6971-6975PubMed Google Scholar) were used as templates in splice polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis (Quick Change kit, Stratagene, Amsterdam, Netherlands). Chimera constructs were generated as deduced from the primary sequences of both immature proteins. Human (h) or murine (m) K19/Q25-R/Q587 was fused to m or h A/T588-N785, and the resulting constructs were designated h/m or m/h, respectively; a fusion construct carrying h or m K19/Q25-D/E305, and m or h to L/P306-N785 was designated h1–10m/m or m1–10h/h, respectively; h or m K19/Q25-S196 fused to m or h I197-D/E305 and to h or m L/P306-N785 was designated hm7–10h/h or mh7–10m/m, respectively; m or h Q25/K19-S196 fused to h or m I197-E/D305, m or h P/L306-L497, h or m L/F498-T545, and m or h M/Q546-N785 was named mh7–10mh19–20/m or hm7–10hm19–20/h; hK19-V220 fused to m L221-E305 to h P306-N785 was named hm8–10h/h; hK19-E246 fused to m V247-E305 to h P306-N785 was named hm9–10h/h; hK19-Q275 fused to m I276-E305 to h P306-N785 was named hm10h/h; hK19-V220 fused to m L221-Y275 to h I276-N785 was named hm8–9h/h; hK19-E246 fused to m V247-Y275 to h I276-N785 was named hm9h/h; h or m K19/Q25-V/I220 fused to m or h L/T221-E246 to h or m T/V247-N785 was named hm8h/h or mh8m/m, respectively; h or m K19/Q25-A385 fused to m or h W386-L497 to h or m L/F498-N785 was named hm14–18h/h or mh14–18m/m, respectively; and h K19-L497 fused to m F498-T545 to h Q546-N785 was named hm19–20h/h. hMutH lacking the N-terminal seven LRRs has been described (26Meng G.

Chem. 2003; 278: 39822-39829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and an analogous murine construct denoted mMutH lacked the respective subdomain (ΔS48-I220) through deletion. One point mutation of a leucine residue within the LRR consensus sequence of the third LRR motif (L112P) was introduced into both wild-type constructs. A threefold point mutated (N147Q, N414Q, and N442Q) mTLR2 construct with named ΔG3 was generated to impede mTLR2-typical N-glycosylation. Preparation of Inactivated Bacteria Suspensions—Bacteria of the species S. aureus (DSMZ 20231), S. pyogenes (DSMZ 20565), as well as of Enterococcus faecalis (DSMZ 20478) were cultured at 37 °C in standard brain-heart medium overnight and plated on standard blood agar plates for determination of culture purity and colony forming unit titers. Legionella pneumophila (28Garduno R.A. Garduno E. Hoffman P.S. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 4602-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was seeded on coal agar plates, incubated at 37 °C under 8% of CO2 for 5 days, and scraped from the plates for suspension in PBS. Bacterial cells were washed twice with PBS, and the resulting suspensions were heat inactivated through incubation at 56 °C for 50 min. Reporter Gene Assay—HEK293 cells were plated on 96-well plates and cotransfected with an NF-κB-dependent promoter firefly luciferase construct (29Schindler U. Baichwal V.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5820-5831Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a reporter plasmid mediating constitutive expression of Renilla luciferase (30Haase R. Kirschning C.J. Sing A. Schrottner P. Fukase K. Kusumoto S. Wagner H. Heesemann J. Ruckdeschel K. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4294-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), as well as cytomegalovirus-promoter-dependent expression plasmids for human and murine TLR2 fusion constructs by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Preparations of TLR agonists were added to the transfected cells for 16 h. Cells were lysed for measurement of firefly- and Renilla-luciferase activities using reagents from Promega (Madison, WI) and PJK GmbH (Kleinblittersdorf, Germany). Firefly-luciferase activities were related to Renilla-luciferase activities for normalization. For analysis of potential blockage of P3CSK4-induced hTLR2-dependent cell activation by Lau3CSK4, HEK293 cells overexpressing the receptor were preincubated with Lau3CSK4 at a concentration of 100 μg/ml for 30 min. Subsequently, increasing amounts of P3CSK4 were added to distinct wells for 6 h. Similarly, mAb T2.5, which has been demonstrated to neutralize TLR2 by blockage of ligand binding (31Meng G. Rutz M. Schiemann M. Metzger J. Grabiec A. Schwandner R. Luppa P.B. Ebel F. Busch D.H. Bauer S. Wagner H. Kirschning C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1473-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), was added at a concentration of 50 μg/ml 30 min before cellular challenge with P3CSK4 or Lau3CSK4. NF-κB-dependent luciferase activity and IL-8 release were analyzed. Analysis of Supernatants by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay— Transfected HEK293 cells and TLR2-/- MEFs, as well as RAW264.7 and MonoMac6 cells, were cultured on 96-well plates (1 × 104, 3 × 105, 1 × 105, and 1 × 105 cells per well, respectively) and challenged as indicated for 24 h. Culture supernatants were applied to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for measurement of human IL-8, as well as human and murine IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α concentrations by enzyme-mediated colorimetry (Magellan, Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany), according to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay material supplier protocols. Immunoblot Analysis—Flag-tagged and overexpressed proteins were visualized upon lysis of overexpressing cells, optional immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and blotting as described (26Meng G. Grabiec A. Vallon M. Ebe B. Hampel S. Bessler W. Wagner H. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39822-39829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). RAW 264.7 and MonoMac6 cells were challenged for 30 min and lysed. Lysates were applied to each lane of an SDS-PAGE gel. Polyclonal rabbit antisera specific for Flag (Sigma) or phosphorylated p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (Cell Signaling, Frankfurt, Germany) were used. Specific epitopes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Western Lightning, Perkin-Elmer). Whereas lysate of 3 × 105 cells/lane was sufficient to gain significant signals in general, lysate of 1 × 106 MonoMac6 cells had to be fractionated per lane to gain clear signals representing conditional kinase phosphorylation. Flow Cytometry—RAW 264.7 and MonoMac6 cells (0.5 × 106 cells/ml) were rinsed from the culture plates, whereas THP1 cells differentiated by incubation with 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate overnight were detached through incubation with PBS on ice for 5 min. Cells were incubated first with 2% fetal calf serum, 5% normal goat serum, and anti-murine Fcγ III/II Receptor mAb (BD PharMingen, Heidelberg, Germany) or Endobulin S/D (Baxter, Unterschleissheim, Germany) for murine or human cells, respectively. After washing, cells were incubated with a murine and human TLR2-specific (31Meng G. Rutz M. Schiemann M. Metzger J. Grabiec A. Schwandner R. Luppa P.B. Ebel F. Busch D.H. Bauer S. Wagner H. Kirschning C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1473-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) and a secondary murine IgG-specific mAb (FITC-labeled, Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, California) subsequently. For intracellular staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized by incubation with BD Cytofix/Cytoperm reagent (BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany) according to the supplier protocol before incubation with antibodies. Samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Bioscience). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Analysis—RAW264.7 or MonoMac6 cells were challenged in RPMI 1640 serum containing 2% fetal calf serum for 2 h, and nuclear extracts were prepared. Cells were lysed, and nuclear proteins analyzed as described previously (26Meng G. Grabiec A. Vallon M. Ebe B. Hampel S. Bessler W. Wagner H. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39822-39829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical Staining and Uptake of Biotinoylated Lipopeptide—THP1 cells, differentiated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or murine macrophages, were grown on glass carriers in a 24-well culture plate and incubated with biotinoylated P3CSK4 or Lau3CSK4 for the time periods indicated. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 50 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated concanavalin A (Molecular Probes, Amsterdam, Netherlands) in serum-free RPMI 1640 at 4 °C for 15 min. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS and fixed with cold methanol for 8 min at -20 °C. Cells were blocked with 2% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C. As first antibody a TLR2-specific mAb cross-reacting with murine and human TLR2 (31Meng G. Rutz M. Schiemann M. Metzger J. Grabiec A. Schwandner R. Luppa P.B. Ebel F. Busch D.H. Bauer S. Wagner H. Kirschning C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 1473-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) was applied before washing after 30 min of incubation. As second antibody, Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-murine IgG (4 μg/ml), as well as Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated Streptavidin (10 μg/ml) for detection of labeled lipopeptides, was applied for 30 min (Molecular Probes). Cells were washed and sealed by incubation in mounting fluid (Chlamydia pneumoniae micro-IF, Labsystems Oy, Helsinki, Finland) for analysis with a laser-scanning microscope with documentation unit (LSM510, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Deglycosylation—Human and murine wild-type TLR2 constructs, as well as designated MutH constructs and an N-glycosylation site-deficient mTLR2 construct (ΔG3), were subjected to N-specific deglycosylation assay according to the protocol provided by the supplier of peptide:N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs, Frankfurt, Germany), which cleaves complex oligosaccharides from N-linked glycoproteins. In brief, Flag-tag specifically immunoprecipitated (Flag-beads, Sigma) (26Meng G. Grabiec A. Vallon M. Ebe B. Hampel S. Bessler W. Wagner H. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39822-39829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) constructs were incubated at 100 °C for 10 min in denaturing buffer to which Nonidet P-40 and peptide:N-Glycosidase F were added within a total volume of 25 μl thereafter. In parallel, the same amount of precipitated protein was incubated in the absence of peptide:N-glycosidase F. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, samples were loaded to an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to PAGE, as well as immunoblot analysis subsequently. Comparative Mutagenesis of Human and Murine TLR2— Comparative amino acid sequence analysis of human and murine TLR2 revealed 70% overall identity. In contrast, extracellular and intracellular domain sequences show 65 and 84% identity, respectively. We subdivided the ECD sequences of human and murine TLR2 into 20 LRR/LRR-like motifs (32Kirschning C.J. Schumann R.R. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2002; 270: 121-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and refer to these as LRRs. Alignment of both TLR2 sequences showed identical localization of these motifs and thus enabled the individual comparison of each of the LRRs (Fig. 1A). The intracellular domain was exchanged between human and murine TLR2 to control for their potential species-specific activity. No evidence for species-specific properties was apparent from analysis in human (HEK293) or murine (TLR2-/- MEF) cells (Fig. 1B, constructs h/m and m/h, and data not shown). To search for species specificity through non-conserved regions of the two TLR2ECD sequences, we swapped the first half of the LRR-rich domains because LRR motifs 1 to 10 displayed lower interspecies similarity than motifs 11 to 20 (Fig. 1B, h1–10m/m and m1–10h/h). We also exchanged a region encompassing the four LRR motifs 7 to 10 because conservation of their sequences is particularly low (Fig. 1, A and B,mh7–10m/m and hm7–10h/h). For fine-mapping of this block of LRRs, LRRs 8 to 10, 9 to 10, 8 to 9, as well as single motifs 8, 9, and 10 were swapped (constructs hm8–10h/h, hm9–10h/h, hm8–9h/h, hm8h/h, mh8m/m, hm9h/h, and hm10h/h). To analyze a potential role of another low-conserved region within the TLR2ECD, we additionally exchanged the LRR motifs 19 and 20 (Fig. 1B, constructs mh7–10mh19–20/m and hm7–10hm19–20/h) and exchanged LRRs 19 and 20 only (hm19–20/h). Another relatively small conserved region is the LRR block encompassing motifs 14 to 18, which was analyzed similarly (mh14–18m/m and hm14–18h/h,). A mutant “H” lacking the N-terminal third of the LRR-rich domain of human TLR2 has been described previously (26Meng G. Grabiec A. Vallon M. Ebe B. Hampel S. Bessler W. Wagner H. Kirschning C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39822-39829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and an analogous murine TLR2 construct was generated (Fig. 1B, mMutH). Two constructs of human and murine TLR2 carrying the point mutation L112P (this affects a consensus leucine residue within the respective third LRR motifs) were also prepared. N-Glycosylation is critical for TLR4 function (33da Silva Correia J. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1845-1854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and for TLR2 surface expression (34Weber A.N. Morse M.A. Gay N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34589-34594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), suggesting that distinctive N-glycosylation might lead to species specificity of pattern recognition through TLR2. Application of the NetNGlyc 1.0 algorithm 2Internet address: www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/. revealed presence of four N-residues that are putatively glycosylated in hTLR2ECD (amino acid residues 114, 199, 414, and 442, respectively), whereas in mTLR2ECD only three sites have a significant potential for being N-glycosylated (amino acid residues 147, 414, and 442). We considered glycosylation of a putative fourth site as unlikely (residue 296) because of conformational constraints induced by a proline following the respective asparagine. Glutamine residues were introduced into a wild-type mTLR2 expression construct to replace the central asparagines within the three canonical N-glycosylation sites (ΔG3). All TLR2 constructs were expressed at similar levels upon transfection in HEK293 cells as analyzed by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Comparative Analysis of TLR2 Construct Activities by Genetic Complementation of HEK293 Cells—To compare responsiveness to whole bacterial cells, HEK293 cells expressing either human or murine TLR2 were challenged with suspensions of heat inactivated bacteria at increasing concentrations. Results revealed a similar trend in respect to NF-κB-dependent reporter gene activation and IL-8 release through both wildtype receptors. Cell activation by heat-inactivated bacteria (Fig. 2A) or defined microbial products such as lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycan through TLR2 was species-independent (Fig. 2B). Exchange of the extracellular domains between human and murine TLR2 did not alter cellular responsiveness, indicating full function of the murine TLR2ICD in human embryonic fibroblasts (Fig. 2B and data not shown). However, application of lipopeptide analogs (Fig. 3A) carrying acyl chains of reduced length (as compared with the classical P3CSK4, which contains 16 C-atoms in its palmitoyl chain) revealed TLR2 species specificity. Although P3CSK4 (tri-palmitoylated peptide) and Myr3CSK4 (tri-myristoylated) induced cell activation to similar degrees, Lau3CSK4 (tri-lauroylated) was recognized specifically through mTLR2ECD but not hTLR2-ECD unless more than one hundred-fold-increased ligand-concentrations were used (Fig. 3, B to D and data not shown).Fig. 3Human and murine TLR2-specific responsiveness to lipopeptide challenge.A, structure of lipopeptide analogs (CSK4, cysteinylseryl-(lysyl)3-lysine) carrying triacylations of distinct lengths (x,CH2-group number as indicated; Lau, lauroyl; Myr, myristoyl; P, palmitoyl).

In this complex the angiotensin receptor type 1 associates with the potassium channel α-subunit Kv4.3 and regulates its intracellular distribution and gating properties. Co-localization of Kv4.3 with angiotensin receptor type 1 and fluorescent resonance energy transfer between those two proteins labeled with cyan and yellow-green variants of green fluorescent protein revealed that Kv4.3 and angiotensin receptor type I are located in close proximity to each other in the cell. The angiotensin receptor type 1 also co-immunoprecipitates with Kv4.3 from canine ventricle or when co-expressed with Kv4.3 and its β-subunit KChIP2 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Treatment of the cells with angiotensin II results in the internalization of Kv4.3 in a complex with the angiotensin receptor type 1. When stimulated with angiotensin II, angiotensin receptors type 1 modulate gating properties of the remaining Kv4.3 channels on the cell surface by shifting their activation voltage threshold to more positive values. We hypothesize that the angiotensin receptor type 1 provides its internalization molecular scaffold to Kv4.3 and in this way regulates the cell surface representation of the ion channel.

Marban E. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 42: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 12Beuckelmann D.J. Nabauer M. Erdmann E. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 13Wettwer E. Amos G.J. Posival H. Ravens U. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The mechanism of Ito down-regulation in heart failure is not completely understood and is likely to have multiple etiologies. In part it can be explained by the inhibitory effects of angiotensin II. Experiments with spontaneously hypertensive rats suggest that the AT1 receptor might be directly involved in the regulation of Ito. In this animal model Ito is inhibited and can be recovered by treatment with the AT1 receptor specific antagonist losartan (14Cerbai E. Crucitti A. Sartiani L. De Paoli P. Pino R. Rodriguez M.L. Gensini G. Mugelli A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 388-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Experiments with isolated cardiomyocytes show that stimulation of the AT1 receptor results in the inhibition of Ito in myocytes from rat or canine ventricle (15Shimoni Y. Liu X.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: H1168-H1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Yu H. Gao J. Wang H. Wymore R. Steinberg S. McKinnon D. Rosen M.R. Cohen I.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1062-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In large mammals such as dogs or humans with substantial ventricular wall thickness, Ito exhibits a transmural gradient that is vital for normal electrical activity (17Nabauer M. Beuckelmann D.J. Uberfuhr P. Steinbeck G. Circulation. 1996; 93: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 18Antzelevitch C. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 50: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Distortion of the Ito gradient leads to dispersion of repolarization across the ventricular wall, providing a substrate for ventricular arrhythmias (19Oudit G.Y. Kassiri Z. Sah R. Ramirez R.J. Zobel C. Backx P.H. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2001; 33: 851-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In both canine and human ventricle, Ito density is higher in epicardial and midmyocardial than in the endocardial cells (17Nabauer M. Beuckelmann D.J. Uberfuhr P. Steinbeck G. Circulation. 1996; 93: 168-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 18Antzelevitch C. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 50: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The gradient of Ito inversely correlates with the gradient of angiotensinogen across the ventricular wall whose expression is more prominent in the subendocardial than in either midmyocardium or epicardium regions (20Sawa H. Tokuchi F. Mochizuki N. Endo Y. Furuta Y. Shinohara T. Takada A. Kawaguchi H. Yasuda H. Nagashima K. Circulation. 1992; 86: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Evidence exists that cardiomyocytes, Purkinje fibers, and cardiac fibroblasts produce angiotensin II (21Dostal D.E. Rothblum K.N. Conrad K.M. Cooper G.R. Baker K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C851-C863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Zhang X. Dostal D.E. Reiss K. Cheng W. Kajstura J. Li P. Huang H. Sonnenblick E.H. Meggs L.G. Baker K.M. Am. J.

Therefore, locally produced angiotensin II could act in a paracrine and/or autocrine manner to regulate Ito. Experiments in vitro show that losartan stimulates Ito in canine cardiomyocytes isolated from endocardium and converts the configuration of the action potential of endocardial myocytes to that found in epicardium (16Yu H. Gao J. Wang H. Wymore R. Steinberg S. McKinnon D. Rosen M.R. Cohen I.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1062-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Ito is rapidly activated and inactivated in response to myocyte depolarization and the rapid repolarization phase (phase 1) of the cardiac action potential and gives rise to a notched appearance of the action potential in epicardial myocytes. The absence of a prominent notch in the endocardial action potential is a consequence of the much smaller Ito (18Antzelevitch C. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 50: 426-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The molecular correlates of Ito belong to the A-type family of ion channels that include several subfamilies of α-subunits: Shaker (Kv1.4), Shaw (Kv3.4), and Shal (Kv4.1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3). Proteins of the Shal family, Kv4.2 and Kv4.3, are considered to be the dominant molecular correlates of Ito in cardiomyocytes (24Barry D.M. Trimmer J.S. Merlie J.P. Nerbonne J.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 361-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Brahmajothi M.V. Campbell D.L. Rasmusson R.L. Morales M.J. Trimmer J.S. Nerbonne J.M. Strauss H.C. J. Gen.

The molecular identity of Ito is species-specific. In ferret and rat hearts the molecular correlate of Ito is both Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 (24Barry D.M. Trimmer J.S. Merlie J.P. Nerbonne J.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 361-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Brahmajothi M.V. Campbell D.L. Rasmusson R.L. Morales M.J. Trimmer J.S. Nerbonne J.M. Strauss H.C. J. Gen.

Ion channels of the Shal family, Kv4.2 and Kv4.3, are regulated by a variety of extracellular factors including inhibition via α1-adrenergic, muscarinic, endothelin, and angiotensin receptors (15Shimoni Y.

Studies of Ito regulation via α1-adrenergic, muscarinic, endothelin, and angiotensin receptors in isolated cardiomyocytes or in the Xenopus oocyte expression system reveal the important role of protein kinase C activation in Ito inhibition (15Shimoni Y.

To conduct more detailed studies of the mechanism of Ito regulation by angiotensin II, we co-expressed Kv4.3 with the AT1 receptor in HEK 293 cells. Recently, it was shown that ion transport by pore-forming α-subunits of the Kv4.x family depends on the presence of calcium sensing proteins, KChIPs, which form complexes with them and deliver the α-subunits to the cell surface (36An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 37Shibata R.

In the studies presented below, we investigate how angiotensin II affects gating properties and the intracellular localization of the Kv4.3 channel. Materials—Rat angiotensin receptor type 1 with an HA-tag at the N-terminal end (HA-AT1 receptor) in the pcDNA3.1 expression vector was generously provided by Dr. Caron (Duke University Medical Center Durham, NC). Rat cDNAs for Kv4.3 and KChIP2 were kindly provided by Dr. McKinnon (SUNY at Stony Brook, New York). Rabbit polyclonal anti-AT1 receptor (306) antibody, goat polyclonal anti-Kv4.3 (C-17) antibody, and mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (clone F7) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Kv4.3 were purchased from Alomone Labs. Mouse monoclonal anti-V5 antibody was obtained from Invitrogen. Rat monoclonal anti-HA antibody (clone 3F10) covalently coupled to agarose beads was obtained from Roche Applied Science. Mouse monoclonal rhodamine-conjugated anti-HA antibody (clone F7, anti-HA-TRITC) and mouse monoclonal fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-V5 antibody (anti-V5-FITC) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Invitrogen, respectively. Prestained molecular weight markers were purchased from New England Biolabs. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Expression Constructs—Kv4.3 and KChIP2 were cloned into the pBudCE4.1 expression vector (Invitrogen). This expression vector allows expression of two recombinant proteins in mammalian cells from the EF-1α and cytomegalovirus promoters. Kv4.3 was cloned into the pBudCE4.1 expression vector after the EF-1α promoter between the NotI and BglII restriction sites and expressed as the C terminally V5-tagged derivative (Kv4.3-V5). KChIP2 was cloned into the pBudCE4.1 expression vector between the HindIII and XbaI restriction sites after the cytomegalovirus promoter and expressed as C terminally myc-tagged or untagged protein. Green fluorescent protein-labeled derivatives of Kv4.3 and the AT1 receptor were obtained by cloning the proteins into the ECFP-C1 and EYFP-N1 expression vectors (Clontech), respectively. Kv4.3 was N-terminal-tagged by a cyan fluorescent variant of green fluorescent protein (ECFP-Kv4.3) after cloning into the ECFP-C1 expression vector at the BglII-XbaI restriction sites. The AT1 receptor, tagged at the C-terminal end with yellow-green fluorescent protein, AT1-EYFP, was obtained after AT1 receptor cloning into the EYFP-N1 expression vector at the HindIII-BamHI restriction sites. Cell Culture—HEK 293 cells were maintained on DMEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (60 μg/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. For the expression of recombinant proteins, cells were transiently transfected with expression vectors using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Assay of Kv4.3-dependent Ion Current—HEK 293 cells on 35-mm plastic dishes were transiently transfected with the pBudCE4.1 expression vector encoding Kv4.3-V5 with (Kv4.3-V5·KChIP2-myc) and without KChIP2-myc. To study the effects of angiotensin II, the cells were co-transfected with Kv4.3-V5·KChIP2-myc and the HA-AT1 receptor. The EGFP-N1 expression vector (Clontech) was used to express the EGFP reporter gene (4 μg of total recombinant DNA, Kv4.3-V5·KChIP2-myc/HA-AT1/EGFP-N1 at a plasmid ratio of 1/2/1). Thirty hours after transfection, cells were serum-starved for 3 h in DMEM in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C and treated with or without 1 μm angiotensin II for 1 h. Ion currents were recorded using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Whole-cell patch clamp recording was performed using the Axo-patch-1D amplifier coupled to the pCLAMP data acquisition and analysis software package (Axon Instruments, Inc). Patch clamp electrodes contained 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 80 mm K-aspartate, 1 mm MgCl2, 3 mm magnesium-ATP, and 10 mm EGTA. Cells were maintained at 22 °C on the microscope stage in a bath solution that contained 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose. In the case of cells treated with angiotensin II, the bath solution contained 1 μm angiotensin II. Current density was assayed by depolarizing with a 400-ms voltage step from a holding potential of -80 mV to the test potential of +50 mV. Recovery from inactivation was studied using a paired pulse protocol. A 200-ms test pulse from -80 mV to the test potential of +50 mV was followed by a variable recovery interval (10–300 ms) at -80 mV, then by a second test pulse to +50 mV. To study the dependence of Ito on activation voltage, a current was elicited by a family of depolarizing voltage steps, in 10 mV increments, from a -80-mV holding potential to a maximal +50-mV test voltage. All current traces were processed with the Clamp-Fit software package. Immunocytochemistry—HEK 293 cells were plated on a Lab-Tek II chamber slide (4-well) (Nalge Nunc International), and transiently co-transfected with Kv4.3-V5·KChIP2-myc, and HA-AT1 receptor (0.4 μg of total DNA/well, with Kv4.3-V5·KChIP2-myc/HA-AT1 plasmids at a ratio of 1/2). After 30 h, cells were washed in DMEM twice for 5 min, serum-starved for 3 h in DMEM in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C, and treated with or without 1 μm angiotensin II in DMEM for 1 h. After that cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min, blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, and incubated for 2 h with anti-HA-TRITC (10 ng/μl) and anti-V5-FITC antibodies (5 ng/μl). Chamber slides were washed 4 × 15 min with phosphate-buffered saline, the nuclei were counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and chamber slides were mounted on coverslips with VectaShield mounting media (Vector Laboratories). Immunofluorescence was analyzed by deconvolution microscopy using the AxioVision 4.1 imaging software package coupled to an Axiovert 200M fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). Cross-sectional images were obtained with 250-nm Z-stack steps and processed using the AxioVision 4.1 constrained iterative algorithm. Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)—HEK 293 cells were plated on to poly-d-lysine coated 35-mm coverslip-bottom number 1 German glass cell culture dishes (BD Biosciences) and transiently co-transfected with ECFP-Kv4.3, KChIP2, and AT1-EYFP (3 μg of total DNA, with ECFP-Kv4.3/pBudCE4.1-KChIP2/AT1-EYFP plasmids in a ratio of 1/1/2). FRET experiments were performed 30 h after transfection. Cells were serum-starved in FRET incubation buffer containing 0.02 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2 for 3 h at 37 °C, placed in the thermostatic chamber (37 °C) of the Axiovert 200M fluorescence microscope, and treated with 1 μm angiotensin II in FRET buffer. FRET in live cells was monitored using a donor (CFP), acceptor (YFP) and FRET filter set (Carl Zeiss). Acquired FRET images were processed with the AxioVision FRET software package using a donor-acceptor concentration-independent algorithm (38Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Membrane Preparation from Heart Tissue—Pieces of tissue from canine left epicardium or endocardium (1–2 g) were homogenized in an ice cold 10-fold volume (weight/ml) of 10 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm histidine buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails I and II (Sigma) with five 10-s bursts at full speed on a Polytron homogenizer (Brinkmann, Westbury, NY). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 500 × g at 4 °C. Membranes were precipitated from the resultant supernatant by centrifugation for 90 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. Protein Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Kv4.3 was immunoprecipitated from the detergent extracts of heart membranes prepared as described above using rabbit polyclonal anti-Kv4.3 antibody. For this, membranes were treated with lysis buffer containing Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and a set of protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (cocktails type 1 and II) for 5 min at 22 °C. The extract was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g and 4 °C for 30 min and used for protein immunoprecipitation. Kv4.3 was immunoprecipitated from 1 ml of lysate (1 mg of total protein) by incubation with 5 μg of primary antibodies for 4 h at 4 °C followed by adsorption of primary antibodies on protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight. Agarose beads were washed four times with 1 ml of wash buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Kv4.3 and the AT1 receptor were detected after the immunoblotting of SDS-PAGE-separated proteins with goat polyclonal anti-Kv4.3 antibody (C-17) and rabbit polyclonal anti-AT1 receptor antibody (306 antibody). HA-AT1 receptor and Kv4.3-V5 expressed in HEK 293 cells were immunoprecipitated after treatment of the cells with the lysis buffer (described above) for 5 min at 22 °C. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and used for the HA-AT1 receptor and Kv4.3-V5 immunoprecipitation with rat monoclonal anti-HA high affinity antibody (clone 3F10) and anti-V5 antibody covalently coupled to protein A/G PLUS-agarose beads. The cleared cell lysate (1 ml, 1 mg of total protein) was incubated with antibodies for 4 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads were washed four times with wash buffer (described above). After protein separation on SDS-PAGE, HA-AT1 receptor and Kv4.3-V5 were detected by immunoblotting with the corresponding anti-HA and anti-V5 antibodies. Effects of Angiotensin II on Kv4.3 Co-expressed with the Angiotensin Receptor Type 1—To simplify the immunochemical analysis Kv4.3, KChIP2, and the AT1 receptor were tagged with V5-, myc-, and HA-tags, respectively. The HA-tagged AT1 receptor is functional and routinely used to study angiotensin II signal transduction pathways (39Oppermann M. Freedman N.J. Alexander R.W. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

The co-expression of KChIP2-myc with Kv4.3-V5 resulted in a more rapid recovery from inactivation and translocation of the channel to the cell surface (Fig. 1) as was reported for the wild type proteins (36An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 37Shibata R.

The co-expression of HA-AT1 receptor with Kv4.3-V5 and KChIP2-myc resulted in a 10% decrease in the current density (Fig. 2). The current density was decreased by 90% in cells expressing AT1 receptor and treated with angiotensin II (Fig. 2). The inactivation rate and the rate of recovery from inactivation are unchanged by co-expression with the AT1 receptor and treatment of cells with angiotensin II. Representative recordings are shown in Fig. 3. Treatment with angiotensin II leads to a significant positive shift in the voltage threshold for activation (Fig. 4). The threshold voltage estimated with and without the AT1 receptor co-expression was -35 mV. After treatment with 1 μm angiotensin II, the remaining current shows an activation voltage threshold of -20 mV (Fig. 4, F and G).Fig. 3Effects of AT1 receptor expression in HEK 293 cells and cells treatment with angiotensin II on the rates of Kv4.3 inactivation and recovery from inactivation. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with Kv4.3-V5·KChIP2-myc with or without cotransfection with HA-AT1 receptor. AT1 receptor-expressing cells were treated with or without 1 μm angiotensin II for 1 h. Expression of AT1 receptor or treatment of cells with angiotensin II does not change the rates of inactivation or recovery from inactivation.

The addition of angiotensin II resulted in the internalization of the AT1 receptor (Fig. 5B). Remarkably, Kv4.3 was also removed from the cell surface by angiotensin II (Fig. 5B). The majority of the internalized AT1 receptor co-localizes with Kv4.3 in intracellular vesicles (Fig. 5B). The prominent internalization of Kv4.3 correlates with the dramatic reduction in the peak current density in the presence of angiotensin II. The co-localization of the AT1 receptor with Kv4.3 in intracellular compartments suggests that Kv4.3 and the AT1 receptor might be targeted by angiotensin II into the same internalization complexes. AT1 Receptor Association with Kv4.3—We used resonance energy transfer to test whether Kv4.3 and the AT1 receptor are located in close proximity to each other when co-expressed in HEK 293 cells. Previous investigators have shown that GFP-fused Kv4.3 produces a functional ion channel which is regulated by KChIP1 (41Hatano N. Ohya S. Imaizumi Y.

C terminally GFP-tagged AT1 receptor yields a functional receptor and is routinely used for receptor internalization assays (42Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The data presented in Fig. 6 show a series of time lapse (0–55 min) FRET images of a living HEK 293 cell. The cells were co-transfected with AT1-EYFP, ECFP-Kv4.3, and untagged KChIP2. White and red colors in Fig. 6 represent the highest levels of resonance energy transfer, whereas blue and black correspond to low or absent resonance energy transfer. The FRET signal is localized along the cytoplasmic membrane prior to the addition of angiotensin II. Cell treatment with angiotensin II leads to a gradual redistribution of the FRET signal from the cell surface into intracellular compartments. After 55 min in the presence of angiotensin II, the majority of the FRET signal is localized inside the cell (Fig. 6). Data from the resonance energy transfer experiments suggest that the AT1 receptor and Kv4.3 are targeted into the same internalization complexes by angiotensin II and located in close proximity to each other. The expected distance between the AT1 receptor and Kv4.3 is less than 100 Å. This suggests that Kv4.3 and the AT1 receptor might form a macromolecular complex. Complex Formation of AT1 Receptor with Kv4.3—Immunoprecipitation of Kv4.3 from heart membranes reveals a 75-kDa band of Kv4.3 (Fig. 7B) and a 83-kDa band of the AT1 receptor co-immunoprecipitated with the ion channel (Fig. 7A). We found no difference between the amounts of Kv4.3 immunoprecipitated from epi- and endocardial membranes, which correlates with the uniform expression of Kv4.3 across the ventricular wall (43Han W. Bao W. Wang Z. Nattel S. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The same amount of AT1 receptor was co-immunoprecipitated by Kv4.3 from endo- and epicardial membranes. Similar experiments with AT1 receptor and Kv4.3 expressed in HEK 293 cells demonstrated that the receptor and the ion channel form a complex in this heterologous expression system. Kv4.3 was immunoprecipitated from HEK 293 cells by the AT1 receptor as a 75-kDa band (Fig. 8A). The AT1 receptor was represented by two bands, the major broad band at 80 kDa and a less abundant 42-kDa band (Fig. 8B). This combination of bands is typically observed in cultured cells overexpressing the AT1 receptor. The treatment of cells with angiotensin II does not have a significant effect on complex formation between the AT1 receptor and Kv4.3 (Fig. 8A). The co-immunoprecipitation of Kv4.3 with the AT1 receptor is in the good agreement with the results of the FRET analysis and the immunocytochemistry. Taken together, these data suggest that the AT1 receptor forms a stable complex with Kv4.3. This complex undergoes internalization when HEK 293 cells are treated with angiotensin II. The A-type voltage-gated ion channels of the Shal family, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3, play an important role in cardiac physiology by providing the outward current for repolarization during phase 1 of the cardiac action potential. Data obtained from both animal models of hypertension and randomized clinical trials argue that the beneficial effects of inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system are at least in part attributable to the prevention of episodes of sudden cardiac arrhythmias. The down-regulation of Ito might be, at least in part, responsible for the arrhythmogenic potential of angiotensin II. Experiments with isolated cardiomyocytes demonstrated that angiotensin II inhibits Ito in rat and canine myocytes (15Shimoni Y. Liu X.F. Am. J.

Nunoki K. Ishii K. Abe T. Yanagisawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Physiol. 2003; 284: H1168-H1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and can be mimicked by the treatment of Xenopus oocytes expressing Kv4.2 or Kv4.3 with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or diacylglycerol (29Nakamura T.Y.

Physiol. 2001; 281: H2518-H2527Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One important difference between protein kinase C-dependent inhibition of Ito in Xenopus oocytes and the angiotensin II-dependent inhibition of Ito in canine cardiomyocytes (16Yu H. Gao J. Wang H. Wymore R. Steinberg S. McKinnon D. Rosen M.R. Cohen I.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1062-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) or HEK 293 cells is the change in the activation voltage threshold of Kv4.3. The activation voltage threshold of Kv4.3 was depolarized from -35 mV to -20 mV without changes in the inactivation rate of the Ito (Fig. 4). This means that Kv4.3 channels will open at more positive voltages and thus contribute less to the phase 1 repolarization of the myocyte action potential. Modulation of the gating properties of Kv4.3 is important, but it is not the dominant mechanism of Ito inhibition by angiotensin II. We observed a reduction in Ito density by 90% after treatment of cells with angiotensin II. Analysis of the intracellular distribution of Kv4.3 revealed that after exposure to angiotensin II most Kv4.3 was removed from the cell surface and co-localized with the AT1 receptor. It has been established that the cell surface delivery of Kv4.3/Kv4.2 depends on expression of the calcium sensing proteins KChIPs (36An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G.

It was further suggested that a gradient in KChIP2 expression is responsible for the transmural gradient of Ito within the ventricular wall of large mammals (44Rosati B. Pan Z. Lypen S. Wang H.S. Cohen I. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 533: 119-125Crossref Scopus (256) Google Scholar). The rescue of endocardial Ito with losartan (14Cerbai E. Crucitti A. Sartiani L.

Rosen M.R. Cohen I.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1062-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and the data presented above suggest that chronic exposure of cells to angiotensin II results in internalization of Kv4.3. Thus, the cardiac renin-angiotensin system might play a crucial role in establishing the gradient of Ito. It is also possible that Kv4.3 internalization is responsible for the Ito inhibition during episodes of hypertension and heart failure. In HEK 293 cells, internalized Kv4.3 co-localizes with AT1 receptor, suggesting that both the AT1 receptor and Kv4.3 are targeted to the same cellular compartments. To further investigate the mechanism of Kv4.3 internalization, we studied fluorescent resonance energy transfer between CFP-labeled Kv4.3 and the YFP-labeled AT1 receptor. FRET analysis showed that the distance between the AT1 receptor and Kv4.3 was less than 100 Å implying association of the AT1 receptor with Kv4.3 in a macromolecular complex. The co-immunoprecipitation of Kv4.3 with the AT1 receptor demonstrated that the ion channel and the AT1 receptor form a stable complex when co-expressed in HEK 293 cells or in native cardiac tissue. In this respect, the interaction of Kv4.3 with the AT1 receptor is similar to the association of inwardly rectifying potassium channels with the dopamine D2 and D4 or β2-adrenergic receptors, which form stable agonist-independent complexes with Kir3 ion channels (45Lavine N. Ethier N. Oak J.N. Pei L. Liu F. Trieu P. Rebois R.V. Bouvier M. Hebert T.E. Van Tol H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46010-46019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that the AT1 receptor associates with Kv4.3 and serves as a molecular scaffold for the assembly of internalization complexes. It is reasonable to suggest that Kv4.3 internalization occurs via the well established mechanism of AT1 receptor endocytosis, mediated by receptor phosphorylation and complex formation with β-arrestins. However, details of this internalization mechanism remain to be investigated."

We used radioligand binding, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence techniques to examine the properties of wild-type α1β2γ2 and mutant α1β2γ2R43Q GABARs expressed in HEK 293 cells. The γ2R43Q mutation had no affect on the binding affinity of the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam. However, in cells expressing α1β2γ2R43Q GABARs, the number of binding sites for [3H]flunitrazepam relative to wild-type receptors was decreased 75%. Using surface protein biotinylation, affinity purification, and immunoblotting, we demonstrated that expression of cell surface α1β2γ2R43Q GABARs was decreased. Surface immunostaining of HEK 293 cells expressing α1β2γ2R43Q GABARs confirmed that surface expression of the γ2R43Q subunit was reduced. These data demonstrate that the γ2R43Q mutation impairs expression of cell surface GABARs. A deficit in surface GABAR expression would reduce synaptic inhibition and result in neuronal hyperexcitability, which could explain why families possessing the γ2R43Q subunit have epilepsy.

Idiopathic partial and generalized epilepsies are the most common forms of heritable seizure disorders, accounting for 40% of all epilepsies (1Steinlein O. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 106: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Idiopathic epilepsies are those seizure disorders that are not preceded by or concomitant with trauma or other disorders but are due mainly to genetic factors. Because of the ubiquitous role of the neurotransmitter GABA 1The abbreviations used are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; GABAA, GABA, type A; GABAR, GABAA receptor; BZD, benzodiazepine; WT, wild-type; FNZM, flunitrazepam; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. in mediating cortical inhibition, deficits in GABAergic transmission have long been surmised to play a role in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. Recently, several mutations in the GABAA receptor (GABAR) have been identified through the use of genetic linkage analysis in families with idiopathic generalized epilepsies. GABARs are heteropentameric ligand gated chloride channels that mediate fast synaptic inhibition in the brain. The receptors are assembled from a number of different subunits and subunit isoforms, including α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, δ, ϵ, π, and θ (2Nayeem N. Green T.P. Martin I.L. Barnard E.A. J.

The inclusion of a γ subunit confers benzodiazepine (BZD) sensitivity to GABARs (6Pritchett D.B. Sontheimer H. Shivers B.D. Ymer S. Kettenmann H. Schofield P.R. Seeburg P.H.

To date, four mutations in the γ2 subunit of the GABAR (missense mutations R43Q and K289M, the nonsense mutation Q351X, and the anomalous splice-donor site mutation IVS6 + 2T → G) and one mutation in the α1 subunit of the receptor (missense mutation A322D) have been associated with idiopathic epileptic syndromes (9Harkin L.

Using recombinant GABAR expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes and two-electrode voltage clamp recording techniques, no differences in GABA EC50 values between wild-type (WT)α1β2γ2 and mutant α1β2γ2R43Q receptors were observed (13Wallace R.H.

However, the ability of the BZDs flunitrazepam (FNZM) and diazepam to potentiate GABA-activated current was reduced in mutant receptors (13Wallace R.H. Marini C. Petrou S. Harkin L.A. Bowser D.N.

Recombinant receptor expression in HEK 293 cells combined with patch-clamping and rapid drug application techniques demonstrated that the γ2R43Q mutation slowed GABAR deactivation and speeded desensitization (14Bowser D.N.

In contrast, another study using expression in HEK 293 cells and similar recording techniques reported no differences in receptor kinetics or diazepam potentiation of GABA current between mutant and WT receptors but instead observed reductions in maximal GABA-induced current in cells expressing mutant receptors (15Bianchi M.T. Song L. Zhang H. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5321-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we used radioligand binding, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence techniques to clarify and further characterize the properties of WT α1β2γ2 and mutant α1β2γ2R43Q GABAA receptors expressed in HEK 293 cells. Several facets of GABAR function were examined, including receptor cell surface expression, receptor pharmacology, and functional coupling between the GABA and BZD binding sites. Here, we report that the γ2R43Q mutation reduces surface expression of α1β2γ2R43Q receptors while leaving the pharmacology and functional coupling between GABA and BZD binding sites of the receptor intact. Transient Expression in HEK 293 Cells—Wild-type α1, β2, γ2s, and mutant γ2R43Q subunit cDNAs in pcDNA3.1 encoding for human GABA receptor protein were obtained from Dr. Steve Petrou (University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia). Subunit cDNAs were verified by double-stranded DNA sequencing. HEK 293 cells were grown as described previously (16Boileau A.J. Kucken A.M. Evers A.R. Czajkowski C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected at ∼70% confluency with α1, β2, γ2, and mutant γ2R43Q subunit cDNAs and the vector pAdvantage (Promega) at a ratio of 1:1:1:1.5 (4 μg of DNA per subunit and 6 μg of pAdvantage per dish) using a standard CaHPO4 precipitation method (17Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 54: 536-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Radioligand Binding—Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, membrane homogenates were prepared, and homologous competition binding experiments were performed as described in Boileau et al. (16Boileau A.J. Kucken A.M. Evers A.R. Czajkowski C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In brief, membrane homogenates (100 μg) were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with sub-Kd concentrations of radioligand ([3H]muscimol (28.1 Ci/mmol) or [3H]FNZM (84.5 Ci/mmol), Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences) in the absence or presence of 7 different concentrations of corresponding unlabeled ligand (ranging from 0.1 nm-10 μm) in a final volume of 250 μl. Specific binding was defined as 3H-drug bound in the absence of displacing ligand minus the amount bound in the presence of displacing ligand (10 μm). Data were fit by non-linear regression to a one-site competition curve defined by the equation y = Bmax/(1+ (x/IC50)), where y is bound 3H ligand in dpm, Bmax is maximal binding, x is the concentration of displacing ligand, and IC50 is the concentration of unlabeled ligand that inhibits 50% of 3H ligand binding (Prism, GraphPAD Software, San Diego, CA). Because radioactive and non-radioactive ligands were chemically identical, Ki values were calculated using a simplified Cheng-Prusoff/Chou equation: Ki = IC50- [L*], where Ki refers to the equilibrium dissociation constant of the radioligand and [L*] refers to the concentration of radioactive ligand used (Prism). In Table I, Bmax values for FNZM were determined in two ways. In three independent experiments, both Bmax and Ki values for FNZM were determined from eight-point homologous competition assays and curve fitting. In five other experiments, the specific binding of [3H]FNZM to membrane homogenates was measured using only one concentration of [3H]FNZM. The Bmax values were then calculated using the following equation, Bound = ((Bmax × [L])/([L] + Ki)), where Bound is the measured specific [3H]FNZM binding in dpm, [L] is the concentration of [3H]FNZM used in the experiment, and Ki is the apparent binding affinity of FNZM, which we previously established from the original three competition binding assays. Non-radioactive FNZM was obtained as a gift from Dr. Sepinwall (Hoffman-La Roche, Nutley, NJ). Muscimol was obtained from RBI/Sigma.Table IFNZM and muscimol Ki and Bmax values for α1β2γ2 and α1β2γ2R43Q GABARs Values are mean ± S.E. for N number of experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Data were fit using non-linear regression analysis to a sigmoidal dose response curve described by the equation Y = Min + (Max- Min)/(1 + 10^[(logEC50- X)*n]), where Max is maximal potentiation, Min is potentiation at lowest [GABA] tested, EC50 is half-maximal potentiation, X is the logarithm of GABA concentration, and n is the Hill coefficient (Prism). Potentiation was calculated for each GABA concentration as follows: p = (dpmGABA/dpmcontrol)- 1, where dpmGABA is the specific [3H]FNZM bound in the presence of GABA, and dpmcontrol is the specific [3H]FNZM bound in the absence of GABA. Affinity Purification of Surface Receptors—Twenty-four to 48 h post-transfection, intact cells were washed with ice-cold PBS (2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 137 mm NaCl, and 14 mm Na2HPO4,pH 7.1) and incubated with the non-membrane permeable biotinylation reagent NHS-LC (or SS)-Biotin (0.3–0.5 mg/ml in PBS, Pierce) for 30 min at 4 °C to label surface membrane proteins. To quench the reaction, cells were incubated with 10 mm glycine in PBS (10 min at room temperature). Sulfhydryl groups were blocked by incubating the cells with 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide in PBS (15 min at room temperature). Cells were solubilized (overnight at 4 °C) in lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.5 mg/ml Pefabloc, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, Roche Applied Science) and 5 mmN-ethylmaleimide. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (16,000 × g, 10 min at 4 °C) and lysate protein concentration was determined using a BCA protein assay (Pierce). A sample of each lysate (equal protein concentrations) was prepared for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis by adding 2× Laemmli sample buffer (LSB) + 6 m Urea + 100 mm dithiothreitol. Biotinylated surface proteins were affinity purified from the remaining cell lysates by incubating (1 h at 4 °C, rotating) with 100 μl of Immobilized Neutravidin-conjugated agarose bead slurry (Pierce). The samples were then centrifuged (16,000 × g, 10 min at 4 °C), and the beads were washed (six times) with buffer (0.1 or 0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). Surface proteins were eluted from the beads with 200 μl of LSB/urea buffer (6% SDS, 20% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 6 m urea, pH 6.8). Western Blotting—Protein samples were run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45 micron). Blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer containing 2% nonfat milk in TTBS (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris base, 0.05% Tween-20, pH 7.5). Blots were washed once in TTBS (5 min at room temperature) and incubated (1 h at room temperature) in γ2-(1–33) or β2/3 primary antibody at dilutions of 1:250 or 1: 100 in blocking buffer, respectively. The anti-γ2-(1–33) rabbit polyclonal antibody was provided as a generous gift by Dr. Werner Sieghart (University Clinic for Psychiatry, Vienna, Austria) and the anti-β2/3 mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Following incubation in primary antibody, the blots were washed (3 × 10 min) with TTBS and then incubated (1 h at room temperature) in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (for anti-γ2, Pierce) or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-mouse (for anti-β2, Pierce) at a dilution of 1:10, 000 in blocking buffer. The blots were then washed (6 × 5 min) in TTBS and developed with either SuperSignal West Pico or West Femto chemiluminescent substrates (Pierce) for visualization of γ2 and β2 subunits, respectively. A background eliminator was applied to exposed films to remove excessive levels of background signal to better visualize the pertinent bands (Erase-It™ Background Eliminator, Pierce). Immunofluorescence—Cells used for immunofluorescence were transfected without pAdvantage, incubated overnight at 31 °C (5% CO2) and then re-plated on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips and returned to the incubator for an additional 24 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS. For membrane permeabilization, cells were incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed three times with PBS, blocked for 15–20 min with PBS containing 20% goat serum, and incubated in anti-γ2 antibody (diluted 1:500 in blocker) overnight at 4 °C; this was followed by three washes with PBS. Cells were then incubated for 1 h (at room temperature) with Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted 1:1000 in blocker. Cells were washed three times with PBS and mounted onto glass slides. In some cases, both permeabilized and intact cells were incubated in secondary antibody only to determine nonspecific labeling. Fluorescently labeled cells were imaged using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 laser scanning confocal microscope with a ×40 lens. Gain settings were normalized to cells treated with secondary antibody only (such that no fluorescent signal was detected in these controls) and the same gain and laser power settings were used for subsequent analysis of WT and mutant receptor expressing cells labeled with both primary and secondary antibodies. The Effect of γ2R43Q on [3H]Flunitrazepam Binding—Homologous competition binding experiments using FNZM were performed on membrane homogenates prepared from HEK 293 cells expressing α1β2γ2 WT and α1β2γ2R43Q GABARs (Fig. 1A). Both ligand apparent affinity (Kd) and total number of binding sites (Bmax) were measured. The Kd for FNZM was not significantly different between WT and mutant receptors, suggesting that the γ2R43Q mutation does not affect FNZM binding affinity (Table I). However, there was an ∼4-fold (75%) decrease in the maximal number of specific [3H]FNZM binding sites (Bmax) for mutant receptors compared with WT receptors (p < 0.01, Table I). Because FNZM binding affinity was unaltered by the mutation and the mutation only decreased the total number of [3H]FNZM binding sites, the data suggest that the γ2R43Q mutation disrupts expression of α1β2γ2 receptors. These results were supported by the finding that the binding of the imidazobenzodiazepine [3H]Ro15–1788 followed a similar trend, where the total number of binding sites was reduced in α1β2γ2R43Q expressing cells, whereas Kd values were comparable between WT and mutant receptors (data not shown). The Effect of γ2R43Q On [3H]Muscimol Binding—In HEK 293 cells, the co-expression of α1, β2, and γ2 subunits can result in the formation of both αβ and αβγ GABARs (18Boileau A. Li T. Benkwitz C. Czajkowski C. Pearce R.A. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 44: 1003-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As FNZM binds only to GABARs containing a γ subunit, [3H]FNZM binding reveals no clues as to whether the γ2R43Q mutation affects GABA agonist binding and/or αβ receptor expression. To address these questions, we measured the binding of [3H]muscimol, a GABA binding site agonist, which binds to both αβ and αβγ GABARs. The Kd for [3H]muscimol binding was not significantly different between WT and mutant receptors, suggesting that the γ2R43Q mutation does not affect the apparent binding affinity of muscimol (Fig. 1B, Table I). However, unlike our findings with [3H]FNZM, the total number of specific muscimol binding sites (Bmax) was comparable in membrane homogenates prepared from HEK 293 cells expressing α1β2γ2 and α1β2γ2R43Q GABARs (Table I). Because muscimol Kd and Bmax values were not altered by the mutation, the data suggest that the γ2R43Q mutation selectively decreases the number of BZD binding sites while leaving the number and apparent affinity of the GABA binding sites unperturbed. Allosteric Coupling of the GABA and BZD Binding Sites— Although the decrease in the number of [3H]FNZM binding sites suggests that the γ2R43Q mutation disrupts α1β2γ2 GABAR expression, expression was not completely abolished because some [3H]FNZM binding was still detected in membrane homogenates prepared from cells expressing mutant receptors (Fig. 1A). Thus, it is possible that the mutation alters not only expression but also the function of α1β2γ2R43Q GABARs. Although the Kd values for muscimol and flunitrazepam were unaltered by the mutation, we speculated that the mutation could disrupt cross-talk (i.e. coupling) between the BZD and GABA binding sites. To address this possibility, we assessed the ability of GABA to potentiate [3H]FNZM binding to membrane homogenates prepared from HEK 293 cells expressing WT and mutant receptors. In this experimental paradigm, only the receptors containing a γ2 subunit are monitored because αβ GABARs do not bind BZDs. Fig. 2 plots the potentiation of specific [3H]FNZM binding as a function of GABA concentration. In mutant and WT receptors, GABA maximally potentiated FNZM binding 2.4- and 1.4-fold, respectively (Table II). Furthermore, the concentrations of GABA needed to elicit half-maximal potentiation of [3H]FNZM binding (EC50) for WT and mutant receptors were equivalent (Table II). These findings indicate first that the R43Q mutation does not alter the apparent affinity for GABA and second that the mutation leaves the allosteric coupling between the BZD and GABA binding sites intact.Table IIPotentiation of [3H]FNZM binding by GABA Values shown are the mean ± S.E. for N number of experiments. EC50 is the GABA concentration needed to reach half-maximal potentiation of [3H]FNZM binding. Max potentiation refers to potentiation of [3H]FNZM binding at the highest concentrations of GABA tested (top plateau of the dose-response curve). No statistical differences between WT and mutant values were measured using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney (unpaired) test of significance.EC50NMax potentiationNμmα1β2γ2s1.63 ± 0.2831.35 ± 0.113α1β2γ2R43Q1.65 ± 0.9242.43 ± 0.364 Open table in a new tab The Effect of γ2R43Q on Cell Surface Expression of γ2 and β2 Subunits—Whereas the radioligand binding data suggest a selective decrease in γ2 subunit-containing receptors, the data reflect binding to membrane homogenates that contain assembled and partially assembled intracellular receptors as well as fully assembled cell surface receptors. To directly determine the effect of γ2R43Q on surface GABAR expression, we compared total and surface expression of γ2 and β2 subunits by Western blot analysis. Surface proteins of intact cells were labeled with the NHS-biotin and affinity-purified using avidinconjugated agarose beads. When probed with anti-γ and anti-β GABAR antibodies, blots of surface protein from cells expressing WT α1β2γ2 receptors displayed significant amounts of γ2 and β2 subunit immunoreactivity (Fig. 3). Expression of α1β2γ2R43Q receptors decreased surface β2 subunit immunoreactivity to 42 ± 15.7% of WT surface β2 labeling (as measured by densitometry, n = 3) and almost completely abolished the surface γ2 subunit signal to 2.7% ± 1.3% of WT surface γ2 labeling (n = 6, Fig. 3). Western blots of total protein lysates (cell surface and intracellular proteins) showed no significant differences in β2 or γ2 subunit immunoreactivities between cells expressing WT and mutant receptors. These findings suggest that although the γ2R43Q mutation does not alter the total amount of γ2 subunit proteins produced within the cell, it does cause a significant decrease in the fraction of the total γ2 subunit protein pool expressed on the cell surface. Whereas a decrease in surface β2 signal was observed from cells expressing α1β2γ2R43Q receptors compared with WT receptors (58 ± 15.7%), the decrease in signal was significantly less (p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney) than the decrease seen in γ2 subunit reactivity (97 ± 1.3%) and suggests that α1β2 pentameric receptors are being formed and expressed on the cell surface (see “Discussion”). To verify the loss of γ2-containing surface receptors, cell surface expression of WT and mutant γ2 subunits was assayed by immunostaining intact cells with an anti-γ subunit antibody and a fluorescently tagged secondary antibody. Cells expressing WT α1β2γ2 receptors displayed robust γ2 subunit labeling on the cell surface (Fig. 4, A and B, are two representative 40× fields depicting γ2 staining of intact HEK cells expressing WT receptors). In cells expressing α1β2γ2R43Q receptors, the intensity of the γ2 subunit cell surface staining as well as the number of cells labeled were dramatically reduced relative to WT-expressing cells, confirming that the γ2R43Q mutation caused a reduction in γ2 subunit-containing GABARs expressed on the cell surface (Fig. 4, C and D, are two representative 40× fields illustrating γ2 staining of intact cells expressing mutant α1β2γ2R43Q receptors, where the total number of cells in each panel under bright field are comparable with the number of cells in Fig. 4, A and B). In permeabilized cells expressing either WT (Fig. 4E) or mutant α1β2γ2R43Q receptors (Fig. 4F), intense perinuclear fluorescent staining of the γ2 subunit was observed indicating that the mutant γ2R43Q subunit was being produced in similar quantities as WT γ2 subunit. Perinuclear staining was seen in permeabilized cells expressing either WT or mutant receptors, which is consistent with an endoplasmic reticulum localization of the γ2 subunit. The goal of this study was to evaluate the functional effect of the GABAR γ2R43Q mutation linked to human epilepsy. We demonstrate that the main effect of the γ2R43Q mutation is to reduce surface expression of α1β2γ2R43Q receptors while leaving the pharmacology and functional coupling between GABA and BZD binding sites of the receptor intact. As discussed below, our data both extend previous findings and help clarify the inconsistencies in the reported electrophysiological effects of this mutation. Using two electrode voltage clamp recording techniques and expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes, Wallace et al. (13Wallace R.H. Marini C. Petrou S. Harkin L.A. Bowser D.N. Panchal R.G. Williams D.A. Sutherland G.R. Mulley J.C. Scheffer I.E. Berkovic S.F. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 49-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported no differences in GABA evoked current amplitude or GABA EC50 but observed a complete abolition in the ability of diazepam to potentiate GABA current in mutant receptors compared with wild-type receptors and suggested that the mutation disrupted BZD binding. Although the observed inability of diazepam to potentiate GABA current in mutant receptors may suggest an alteration in BZD binding (i.e. altered BZD binding affinity), it could also result from the uncoupling of GABA and BZD binding sites resulting in a loss of BZD modulation of GABA-activated current or from a reduction in the relative expression of α1β2γ2 containing GABARs as compared with α1β2 receptors, which are not modulated by BZDs but are still activated by GABA. Our results indicate that the γ2R43Q mutation disrupts expression of γ2 containing GABARs as evidenced by the decrease in cell surface amounts of γ2 subunit (Figs. 3 and 4) and the 75% reduction in the total number of binding sites for the BZD [3H]FNZM in cells expressing mutant receptors (Fig. 1). Moreover, for the α1β2γ2R43Q receptors that were expressed, the binding affinity for [3H]FNZM and the ability of GABA to potentiate [3H]FNZM binding were similar to wild-type α1β2γ2 receptor values (Figs. 1 and 3). Thus, it is unlikely that the loss of BZD sensitivity observed by Wallace et al. (13Wallace R.H. Marini C. Petrou S. Harkin L.A. Bowser D.N. Panchal R.G. Williams D.A. Sutherland G.R. Mulley J.C. Scheffer I.E. Berkovic S.F. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 49-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the decrease in BZD sensitivity observed by Bowser et al. (14Bowser D.N. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Cromer B.A. Parker M.W. Wallace R.H. Harkin L.A. Mulley J.C. Marini C. Berkovic S.F. Williams D.A. Jones M.V. Petrou S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15170-15175Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) are caused by alterations in BZD binding affinity or the functional coupling between the BZD and GABA binding sites but may instead be the result of a reduction in the relative expression of α1β2γ2R43Q containing GABARs as compared with α1β2 receptors. Alternatively, the differences between our data and those of Wallace et al. (13Wallace R.H. Marini C. Petrou S. Harkin L.A. Bowser D.N. Panchal R.G. Williams D.A. Sutherland G.R. Mulley J.C. Scheffer I.E. Berkovic S.F. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 49-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may be caused by different expression systems (HEK 293 cells versus oocytes). Interestingly, in cells expressing α1β2γ2R43Q receptors, we observed a decrement in the level of β2 subunit expressed on the cell surface in addition to the almost complete loss of surface γ2 subunit (Fig. 3B). This observation raises the intriguing possibility that the γ2R43Q mutation has a dominant negative effect on surface GABAR expression in that it may hamper the expression of α1β2 GABARs as well as α1β2γ2 receptors. Although our binding data demonstrate that the total number of muscimol binding sites is not affected by the γ2R43Q mutation (Fig. 1), the data reflect binding to membrane homogenates that contain assembled and partially assembled intracellular receptors as well as fully assembled cell surface receptors. Intracellular and incompletely assembled receptors containing α and β subunits bind muscimol with similar high affinity (∼10 nm) as fully assembled pentameric receptors (19Klausberger T. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Fuchs T. Ebert V. Sarto I. Sieghart W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16024-16032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As such, any small decrement in cell surface expression could be compensated by muscimol binding to a larger pool of intracellular assembly intermediates, hence explaining the comparable levels of muscimol binding between membranes prepared from cells expressing mutant and WT receptors. This possibility is supported by the finding that in the absence of γ subunits, α and β subunits have a greater propensity to form assembly intermediates (19Klausberger T. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Fuchs T. Ebert V. Sarto I. Sieghart W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16024-16032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 20Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Why a similar phenomenon is not observed for flunitrazepam binding can be explained by the finding that αγ assembly intermediates, though viable, possess a 100-fold lower affinity for flunitrazepam than fully formed αβγ pentamers (19Klausberger T. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Fuchs T. Ebert V. Sarto I. Sieghart W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16024-16032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Our filtration binding assays would not detect the low affinity sites associated with assembly intermediates. Our assay preferentially detects high affinity flunitrazepam binding to pentameric receptors and thus the 75% decrease in flunitrazepam binding observed reflects a decrease in αβγ pentameric receptors. Whereas the mutant γ2 subunit may still be able to assemble individually with α1 or β2 subunits (forming α1γ2 or β2γ2 assembly intermediates), the γ2 subunit mutation could prevent assembly and/or targeting of fully assembled pentameric receptor complexes, thus tagging or targeting both mutant γ and the associated α or β subunits for intracellular sequestration and/or degradation. In this way, the γ2 subunit could sequester some α1 and β2 subunits that would otherwise form “normal” and functional α1β2 heteropentameric receptors that would be expressed on the cell surface. Nevertheless, significant amounts of the β2 subunit were detected in surface protein purified from cells expressing mutant receptors (Fig. 3B) indicating that fully formed α1β2 pentameric receptors are being expressed on the cell surface. It is not likely that the β2 subunits detected on the cell surface are incorporated into anything other than pentamers, as previous studies have shown that partially assembled receptor intermediates containing αγ, αβ, or βγ subunits are not expressed on the cell surface (19Klausberger T. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Fuchs T. Ebert V. Sarto I. Sieghart W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16024-16032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In electrophysiological studies (14Bowser D.N. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Cromer B.A. Parker M.W. Wallace R.H. Harkin L.A. Mulley J.C. Marini C. Berkovic S.F. Williams D.A. Jones M.V. Petrou S. Proc.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5321-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), GABA-evoked currents were measured from HEK 293 cells co-expressing wild-type α, β, and mutant γ2R43Q subunits, indicating expression of some β2 subunit containing receptors on the cell surface. Our data, however, suggest a decrease in surface GABAR protein in cells expressing the mutant γ2R43Q subunit compared with cells expressing WT subunits. This is consistent with results reported in Bianchi et al. (15Bianchi M.T. Song L. Zhang H. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5321-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where HEK 293 cells expressing mutant γ2R43Q subunits displayed reduced GABA current amplitudes. A recent study by Bowser et al. (14Bowser D.N. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Cromer B.A. Parker M.W. Wallace R.H. Harkin L.A. Mulley J.C. Marini C. Berkovic S.F. Williams D.A. Jones M.V. Petrou S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15170-15175Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), using rapid drug application and patch-clamp recordings of HEK 293 cells expressing mutant receptors found that α1β2γ2R43Q receptors displayed slowed deactivation, an increase in the fast component of desensitization, and an increase in paired-pulse desensitization, indicating that the mutation altered receptor kinetics. In contrast, a paper by Bianchi et al. (15Bianchi M.T. Song L. Zhang H. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5321-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using a similar recording technique and cell expression system, reported no differences in macroscopic GABAR kinetics or diazepam potentiation of GABA current in α1β3γ2LR43Q receptors but observed reductions in peak GABA-induced currents instead. It is unclear why the γ2R43Q mutation had different effects on GABAR current responses in the Bowser et al. (14Bowser D.N. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Cromer B.A. Parker M.W. Wallace R.H. Harkin L.A. Mulley J.C. Marini C. Berkovic S.F. Williams D.A. Jones M.V. Petrou S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15170-15175Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and Bianchi et al. (15Bianchi M.T. Song L. Zhang H. Macdonald R.L. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5321-5327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) studies. One possible explanation for these conflicting findings is that different receptor subunit subtypes were expressed in the two studies. Regardless, our data, using biochemical approaches, directly demonstrate that one of the main effects of the γ2R43Q mutation is to reduce cell surface α1β2γ2 receptor expression. However, because the equilibrium radioligand binding techniques used in this study cannot resolve alterations in receptor kinetics, it is certainly possible that the α1β2γ2R43Q receptors that are expressed have altered kinetic properties. A homology model of the N-terminal region of the GABAR based on the crystal structure of the homologous acetylcholine binding protein (21Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar) localizes γ2R43 to the γ/β subunit interface (Fig. 5) and not the BZD binding site interface (α/γ). The γ2R43Q mutation does not affect BZD or GABA apparent binding affinities, which supports the prediction that γ2R43Q is not involved in forming the BZD or GABA binding pockets and also indicates that the mutation does not have an indirect allosteric effect on BZD or GABA apparent binding affinities. Our data demonstrate that γ2R43 is important for efficient cell surface expression of GABARs. γ2R43 is conserved not only in all GABAR subunit subtypes, but also in the subunits of other members of the ligand gated ion channel superfamily. The absolute conservation of this arginine points to a structural role. By mutating γ2 Arg 43 to Glu, putative electrostatic interactions with a nearby negatively charged residue (γ2E178) and a positively charged residue on the neighboring β2 subunit (R117) may be disrupted (Fig. 5), thus preventing the stable or successful incorporation of the γ2 subunit into a pentamer (22Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Parker M.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 280-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Although the idea that a single residue could have such an impact on cell surface expression may seem dubious, the concept is not unprecedented. Recently, a single residue (Ser-171) in the γ2 subunit when mutated to glycine or cysteine has been found to completely abolish cell surface expression and assembly of α2β1γ2 GABARs (23Jin P. Walther D. Zhang J. Rowe-Teeter C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14179-14183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). It is also equally possible that γ2R43 is part of a larger assembly motif that when altered disrupts the assembly of the γ2 subunit with either α1 or β2 subunits. Previous experiments have shown that residues within the N-terminal domain of the γ2 subunit are critical for selective subunit assembly and subunit arrangement (24Sarto I. Wabnegger L. Dogl E. Sieghart W. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 43: 482-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 25Klausberger T. Sarto I. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Furtmuller R. Mayer B. Huck S. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9124-9133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the underlying mechanism responsible for reduced cell surface expression of γ2R43Q subunit containing GABARs is unclear (e.g. misfolding, reduced subunit assembly, reduced surface membrane receptor targeting, increased degradation), the γ2 subunit is indispensable for the maintenance of GABARs at synapses (26Schweizer C. Balsiger S. Bleuthmann H. Mansuy I.M. Fritschy J.M. Mohler H. Luscher B. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 24: 442-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). As such, the decrease in surface expression of γ2 containing receptors by the γ2R43Q mutation would likely blunt synaptic inhibitory neurotransmission, thereby contributing to neuronal hyperexcitability and hence the etiology of epilepsy.

The repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, DNA double-strand break; NHEJ, non-homologous end joining; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase. is critical for the maintenance of genomic integrity and stability. There are two main DSB repair pathways in eukaryotes: homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (1Krejci L. Chen L. Van Komen S. Sung P. Tomkinson A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 75: 159-201Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the error-free homologous recombination pathway, an intact homologous DNA duplex acts as a template for repair, resulting in the accurate restoration of the broken DNA molecule. By contrast, in NHEJ, the two broken ends are simply rejoined to one another in a process that frequently causes loss and/or gain of nucleotides at the break site and occasionally results in the joining of previously unlinked DNA molecules. Notably, defects in the repair of DSBs by either homologous recombination or NHEJ have been linked with cancer predisposition (2Liu Y. West S.C. Breast Cancer Res. 2002; 4: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 3Ferguson D.O. Sekiguchi J.M. Chang S. Frank K.M. Gao Y. DePinho R.A. Alt F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Studies with mammalian cells identified the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which is composed of the DNA end binding Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer and the DNA-PK catalytic subunit, and the DNA ligase IV/XRCC4 complex as key NHEJ factors (4Critchlow S.E.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hdf1/Hdf2 and Dnl4/Lif1 are the functional homologs of Ku70/Ku80 and DNA ligase IV/XRCC4, respectively (4Critchlow S.E. Jackson S.P. Trends Biochem.

Although yeast lacks a DNA-PK catalytic subunit homolog, genetic studies have revealed that the Rad50/Mre11/Xrs2 complex is a key player in NHEJ (4Critchlow S.E. Jackson S.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 394-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 5Boulton S.J. Jackson S.P.

Using purified protein complexes, it has been shown that the Rad50/Mre11/Xrs2 complex has robust end-bridging activity and specifically stimulates intermolecular DNA joining by Dnl4/Lif1 (8Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Furthermore, efficient intermolecular DNA joining mediated by the Rad50/Mre11/Xrs2 and Dnl4/Lif1 complexes was dependent upon Hdf1/Hdf2 at physiological salt concentrations (8Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Based on these results, it seems likely that Hdf1/Hdf2 enhances the recruitment of the Rad50/Mre11/Xrs2 end-bridging complex to DNA ends and that Dnl4/Lif1 joins the resultant juxtaposed DNA ends. The in vitro reconstitution studies described above used linear DNA molecules with cohesive single-strand ends generated by restriction endonucleases. However, the termini of the majority of DSBs generated in vivo by agents such as ionizing radiation will be noncomplementary and may also have damaged termini. Analysis of DNA molecules repaired by NHEJ has shown that short complementary sequences, so called microhomologies, are preferentially used for alignment of broken DNA ends (7Moore J.K. Haber J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2164-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 9Kramer K.M. Brock J.A. Bloom K. Moore J.K. Haber J.E. Mol. Cell.

This suggests that, after DNA ends are brought together, the DNA regions next to the ends are compared in some manner for short complementary sequences. A prediction of this mechanism is that the aligned DNA molecules will have noncomplementary terminal nucleotides that will need to be removed and the resultant gaps filled in before ligation. The conserved eukaryotic DNA structure-specific endonuclase FEN-1(Rad27), is involved in DNA replication, DNA repair, and the maintenance of genome stability (11Johnson R.E. Kovvali G.K. Prakash L.

FEN-1 is member of the growing family of proteins that bind to the interdomain connector loop of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which functions as a ring-shaped homotrimer (17Li X. Li J.

This interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which involves residues in addition to the conserved proliferating cell nuclear antigen binding motif, stimulates the DNA structure-specific endonuclease activity of FEN-1 and presumably contributes to the participation of FEN-1 in Okazaki fragment maturation and long patch base excision repair (13Klungland A.

Although genetic studies in yeast indicate that FEN-1(Rad27) is involved in the processing of aligned NHEJ intermediates with 5′ flaps (16Wu X. Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 24Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. J. Biol.

Yeast Pol4, a member of the Pol X family of DNA polymerases has been implicated in NHEJ events that involve gap-filling DNA synthesis (24Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23599-23609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In accordance with these observations, we recently characterized a physical interaction between Pol4 and Dnl4/Lif1 that coordinates the DNA synthesis and ligation reactions that complete NHEJ (25Tseng H.-M. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45630-45637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is evidence linking the mammalian Pol X family members, Pol μ, Pol λ, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase with DNA ligase IV-mediated end-joining, indicating that the functional interaction between the gap-filling and DNA-joining enzymes in NHEJ is conserved among eukaryotes (26Lee J.W.

An interesting feature of the Pol4-mediated NHEJ events is that, although they also required removal of 5′ or 3′ terminal mismatches, purified preparations of Pol4 did not have nuclease activity (24Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23599-23609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the role of FEN-1(Rad27) in the processing of DNA substrates that mimic NHEJ intermediates with non-complementary 5′ ends. We demonstrate that FEN-1(Rad27) physically and functionally interacts with both Pol4 and the Dnl4 subunit of the Dnl4/Lif1 complex. Furthermore, we show that these factors act in a coordinated manner to process and join DNA molecules with non-complementary 5′ ends. Together these results provide novel mechanistic insights into the end processing reactions that complete the repair of DSBs by NHEJ. Coupled in Vitro Transcription/Translation—Labeled FEN-1(Rad27), Pol4, Pol4ΔBRCT, the Pol4 BRCT domain, Dnl4, and Lif1 were synthesized from pET-FEN-1(Rad27), pGADT7-Pol4, pGADT7-Pol4ΔBRCT, pGADT7-BRCT, pBKS-Dnl4, and pBKS-Lif1 templates using T7 RNA polymerase and [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) in the TnT quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). Labeled proteins were partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation (28Bardwell L. Cooper A.J. Friedberg E.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3041-3049Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and then resuspended in 50 μl of Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine HCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Co-immunoprecipitation—Yeast cell extracts were prepared from the yeast strain BJ5464 harboring the plasmids pADH-Dnl4 and pYES-Lif1 (8Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). In brief, cells from a 100-ml culture were resuspended in 5 ml of Buffer A and lysed by mechanical shearing with glass beads. After centrifugation, the supernatant was used immediately for co-immunoprecipitation. To detect associations between FEN-1(Rad27) and Dnl4/Lif1, yeast cell extracts (200 μl, 26 mg/ml) and labeled in vitro-translated FEN-1(Rad27) (20 μl) were incubated with either antiserum raised against Lif1 (8Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) or pre-immune serum at 4 °C overnight. Protein A-Sepharose beads (10 μl) were added and the incubation continued for 1 h. After collection by centrifugation, the beads were washed extensively with Buffer A and then were resuspended in 20 μl of SDS sample buffer. After electrophoresis through a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar), labeled FEN-1(Rad27) was detected in the dried gel by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Purification of Recombinant His-tagged Proteins—The FEN-1(Rad27) expression plasmid pET-FEN-1(Rad27) was a gift from Dr. Binghui Shen. Overnight cultures (100 ml) of Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pET-FEN-1(Rad27) were inoculated into 1 liter of Luria-Bertani medium containing kanamycin (0.025 mg/ml) and chloramphenicol (0.034 mg/ml) and grown at 37 °C. At an absorbance of 0.5 at 600 nm, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and growth continued at 25 °C for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, flash-frozen, and stored at –80 °C. Frozen cells were resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine HCl, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, the cleared lysate was supplemented with imidazole to a final concentration of 15 mm before incubation with 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose beads (Qiagen) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation and then washed extensively with lysis buffer containing 40 mm imidazole. His-tagged FEN-1(Rad27) was eluted with lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole and then further purified to near homogeneity by Resource Q and Resource S column chromatography. Approximately 0.9 mg of FEN-1(Rad27) was obtained from a 1-liter culture. His-tagged Pol4 and the Dnl4/Lif1 complex were purified from Escherichia coli and yeast, respectively, as described previously (8Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 25Tseng H.-M. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45630-45637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Nickel-Nitrilotriacetic Acid Agarose Pull-down Assays—To detect interactions between FEN-1(Rad27) and the NHEJ components, Dnl4, Lif1, and Pol4, labeled in vitro translated polypeptides (20 μl) and bovine serum albumin (50 μg) were incubated either with or without His-tagged FEN-1(Rad27) (30 μl, 6 μg) at 4 °C for 4 h. The mixtures were supplemented with imidazole to a final concentration of 40 mm before incubation with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose beads (10 μl of a 80% slurry in Buffer A containing 40 mm imidazole) for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and the beads washed extensively with Buffer A containing 40 mm imidazole. An aliquot of the supernatant (2 μl) was diluted by the addition of Buffer A (10 μl) before the addition of SDS sample buffer (2 μl). Bound proteins were eluted from the beads with 15 μl of Buffer A containing 250 mm imidazole. After electrophoresis through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, labeled proteins were detected in the dried gel by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Nuclease Assays—Linear duplexes with short partially complementary single-strand overhangs were constructed by annealing the following pairs of oligonucleotides; 34-mer (5′-ACA AAG TTT GGA TTG CTA CTG ACC GCT CTC GTG C-3′) annealed to 5′-32P-labeled 39 + 3flap (5′-GTT GAC GAG CAC GAG AGC GGT CAG TAG CAA TCC AAA CTT TGT-3′, 42-mer); 54-mer (5′-TCG TCG CGT TGC CTC GCG ACG CAT GAC TCT AAA GGG TTC TAA TAG TGA GAC AGA-3′) annealed to 50MM (5′-GTC TGT CTC ACT ATT AGA ACC CTT TAG AGT CAT GCG TCG CGA GGC AAC GC-3′, 50-mer). Alignment of the complementary single strands generates a non-ligatable nick in the unlabeled strand and a three-nucleotide flap in the labeled strand. A similar strategy was used to construct pairs of duplexes that, when aligned, give different-sized gaps with single strand flaps. Equal amounts of the labeled and unlabeled duplexes (100 nm) were incubated with FEN-1(Rad27) and, where indicated, either Dnl4/Lif1 or Pol4 in reaction mixtures (10 μl) containing 35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP at 25 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 μl of gel loading buffer (95% (v/v) formamide, 0.09% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.09% (w/v) xylene cyanol). After separation by denaturing gel electrophoresis, labeled DNA molecules in the dried gel were detected by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). DNA Synthesis Assays—Linear duplexes with complementary single strand ends were constructed by annealing the following pairs of oligonucleotides; 50-mer (5′-GTA ACA AAG TTT GGA TTG CTA CTG ACC GCT CTC GTG CTC GTC GCT GCG TT-3′) annealed to 39 + 3flap; 43-mer (5′-GCC TCG CGA CGC ATG ACT CTA AAG GGT TCT AAT AG T GAG ACA G-3′) annealed to 5′-32P labeled 50–2-mer (5′-CTG TCT CAC TAT TAG AAC CCT TTA GAG TCA TGC GTC GCG AGG CAA CGC-3′). Alignment of the complementary single strands generates a three-nucleotide gap in the unlabeled strand and a three-nucleotide flap in the unlabeled strand. Equal amounts of the labeled and unlabeled duplexes (100 nm) were incubated with Pol4 and FEN-1(Rad27) in reaction mixture (10 μl) containing 35 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATP at 25 °C for 2 h. Reactions were stopped by the addition of gel loading buffer (95% (v/v) formamide, 0.09% (w/v) bromphenol blue, and 0.09% (w/v) xylene cyanol). After separation by denaturing gel electrophoresis, labeled DNA molecules in the dried gel were detected by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). FEN-1(Rad27) Interacted with Both Dnl4/Lif1 and Pol4 —We have previously characterized a physical and functional interaction between two NHEJ factors, Pol4 and Dnl4/Lif1, that coordinates the gap-filling DNA synthesis and ligation steps of NHEJ (25Tseng H.-M. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45630-45637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because genetic studies have implicated FEN-1(Rad27) in the repair of a subset of NHEJ events that involve removal of 5′ mismatched nucleotides (16Wu X. Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1303-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 24Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23599-23609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), we examined whether FEN-1(Rad27) interacted with Dnl4/Lif1 and/or Pol4. To detect an association between FEN-1(Rad27) and Dnl4/Lif1, labeled in vitro-translated FEN-1(Rad27) (Fig. 1A, lane 2) was incubated with a lysate from a yeast strain overexpressing Dnl4/Lif1 (25Tseng H.-M. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45630-45637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Labeled FEN-1(Rad27) was specifically co-immunoprecipitated by a Lif1 antiserum (Fig. 1A, lane 4). To determine the contribution of the subunits of the Dnl4/Lif1 complex to the interaction with FEN-1(Rad27), we performed pull-down assays with purified His-tagged FEN-1(Rad27) (Fig. 1A, lane 1) and labeled in vitro-translated Dnl4 and Lif1. Dnl4 was specifically retained on nickel beads liganded by His-tagged FEN-1(Rad27), whereas no significant binding of Lif1 was detected (Fig. 1B). Together, these results provide strong evidence that FEN-1(Rad27) interacts directly with the Dnl4 subunit of the Dnl4/Lif1 complex. To determine whether there is a direct interaction between Pol4 and FEN-1(Rad27), we performed pull-down assays with purified FEN-1(Rad27) (Fig. 1A, lane 1) and glutathione-Sepharose beads liganded by either GST-Pol4 or GST. As shown in Fig. 2A, FEN-1(Rad27) bound specifically to the GST-Pol4 beads. To map the region of Pol4 that interacted with FEN-1(Rad27), full-length and truncated versions of Pol4 were synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation. Both full-length Pol4 and a truncated version containing the catalytic C-terminal domain were specifically retained on nickel beads liganded by His-tagged FEN-1(Rad27). In contrast, the N-terminal BRCT domain of Pol4, which we had previously shown to interact with Dnl4 (25Tseng H.-M. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45630-45637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), did not bind to the FEN-1(Rad27) beads (Fig. 2B). Thus, FEN-1(Rad27) bound to a different region of Pol4 than Dnl4/Lif1, raising the possibility that these proteins form a ternary end-processing complex. Activity of FEN-1(Rad27) on DNA Substrates that Mimic NHEJ Intermediates—Although the biochemical properties of FEN-1 have been extensively characterized, these studies have primarily focused on the flap-cleaving activity of FEN-1 using linear DNA substrates containing flaps of varying length (12Lieber M.R. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 30Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 38: 433-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To examine the activity of FEN-1(Rad27) on DNA substrates that more closely mimic intermediates generated by microhomology-mediated end alignment during NHEJ, we constructed linear duplexes that, when annealed by their complementary single-strand ends, generated a linear DNA molecule with a 5′ flap of three nucleotides (Fig. 3A, middle). With this DSB substrate, FEN-1 acts primarily as an endonuclease, with the major incision site located 1 residue into the duplex region adjacent to the duplex/single-strand junction (Fig. 3A, lanes 5–7). In the absence of the unlabeled duplex (Fig. 3A, right), FEN-1(Rad27) exhibited weak exonuclease activity and also cleaved the duplex/single strand junction, generating labeled 7- and 8-nucleotide fragments (Fig. 3A, lanes 10–12). It is noteworthy that both of these activities were suppressed by the presence of the unlabeled duplex with the partially complementary single strand overhang (Fig. 3A, compare lanes 5–7 with lanes 10–12). Thus, FEN-1(Rad27) cleaved the flap structure formed by the annealing of the partially complementary single strand, releasing a four-nucleotide fragment and leaving a one-nucleotide gap within the annealed region holding the duplexes together. This pattern of cleavage was essentially identical to that generated with the same-sized flap within a contiguous linear duplex (Fig. 3A, compare lane 2 with lanes 5–7). As expected, FEN-1(Rad27) was significantly less active when the flap was formed by the annealing of two DNA duplexes compared with a flap in a contiguous linear duplex (data not shown) because of the relative instability of the flap structures formed by the annealing of the complementary four-nucleotide single-strand regions. Together, these results demonstrated that FEN-1(Rad27) cleaved flap structures generated by the annealing of short regions of mcrohomology. Although these structures are unstable in vitro, we anticipate that they will be stabilized in vivo by the presence of end-binding and -bridging factors, such as Hdf1/Hdf2 and Rad50/Mre11/Xrs2 (8Chen L. Trujillo K. Ramos W. Sung P. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1105-1115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Because there may be gaps adjacent to mismatched nucleotides generated during NHEJ, we next examined the effect on FEN-1(Rad27) activity of the size of the gap adjacent to the 5′ flap. We were surprised to find that, in the presence of a one-nucleotide gap, FEN-1(Rad27) acted as an exonuclease on about 50% of the DNA substrate (Fig. 3B, left). In addition, the endonuclease activity generated a ladder of products, ranging from two to five nucleotides in length. When the gap size was increased to two nucleotides, FEN-1(Rad27) acted as an endonuclease but, in this case, the major incision site was located two residues into the duplex region adjacent to the duplex/single-strand junction (Fig. 3B, middle). Finally, with a three-nucleotide gap, FEN-1(Rad27) acted as an endonuclease with the major incision sites at the duplex/single strand junction and two residues into the duplex region adjacent to the duplex/single-strand junction (Fig. 3B, right). Thus, the length of the gap 3′ to the 5′ mismatched flap dramatically effected the mode of action and cleavage site of FEN-1(Rad27). Dnl4/Lif1 Specifically Stimulated FEN-1(Rad27) Endonuclease Activity—To determine whether the interaction with Dnl4/Lif1 modulates the nuclease activity of FEN-1(Rad27), we co-incubated these proteins with DNA duplexes that, when aligned, have no gap adjacent to a three-nucleotide 5′ flap. The addition of increasing amounts of Dnl4/Lif1 stimulated the endonuclease activity of FEN-1(Rad27) (Fig. 4, lanes 2–6) with a 3–4-fold increase in cleavage produced at a 3:1 ratio of Dnl4/Lif1 to FEN-1(Rad27). In contrast, DNA ligase IV/XRCC4, the human homolog of Dnl4/Lif1, did not significantly increase FEN-1(Rad27) activity in similar experiments (Fig. 4, compare lanes 3–6 with lanes 7–10). Pol4 Specifically Stimulated FEN-1(Rad27) Endonuclease Activity—Although Dnl4/Lif1 specifically stimulated FEN-1(Rad27), it did not alter the preferred cleavage site (Fig. 4, compare lanes 2 and 6). Thus, the majority of products generated by FEN-1(Rad27) action would contain a one-nucleotide gap and so would not be ligatable by Dnl4/Lif1. This prompted us to examine whether Pol4, which has been implicated in gap-filling during NHEJ (24Wilson T.E. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23599-23609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 25Tseng H.-M. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45630-45637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), modulated the nuclease activity of FEN-1(Rad27). In assays with the DNA duplexes that, when aligned, have no gap adjacent to the flap, the addition of Pol4 without deoxynucleotide triphosphates markedly stimulated the endonuclease activity but did not change the major incision site of FEN-1(Rad27) (Fig. 5A, lanes 4–7). At a ratio of 2:1, Pol4 increased the extent of FEN-1 cleavage by greater than 30-fold. In contrast, another Pol X family member Pol β only weakly stimulated FEN-1 activity in a similar experiment (Fig. 5A, lanes 8–11). A similar specific stimulation of FEN-1(Rad27) activity by Pol4 was observed when the flap was located within a contiguous duplex (data not shown), indicating that the increase in endonuclease activity did not involve the annealing and/or stabilization of the short complementary sequences. However, when there was a three-nucleotide gap adjacent to the mismatched nucleotides, Pol4 neither markedly increased flap removal nor changed the pattern of incisions by FEN-1(Rad27) (Fig. 5B, lanes 2–5). Similar results were obtained with one- and two-nucleotide gaps adjacent to the mismatched flap (data not shown). Together, these results demonstrate that Pol4 specifically stimulates flap removal by FEN-1(Rad27) when there is no gap adjacent to the flap. Coordinated Gap-Filling Synthesis and Flap Cleavage by Pol4 and FEN-1(Rad27)—Next, we examined the processing of DNA duplexes that, when aligned, have a three-nucleotide gap adjacent to the flap by FEN-1(Rad27) and Pol4 in the presence of the deoxynucleotide triphosphates required to fill in the gap. Under these conditions, the addition of Pol4 not only greatly increased the extent of FEN-1 cleavage but also changed the pattern of FEN-1 incisions (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 4 and 5 with lanes 10 and 11). At a ratio of 2:1, Pol4 stimulated cleavage by FEN-1(Rad27) by about 10-fold. It is noteworthy that the major incision site was now located 1 residue into the duplex region adjacent to the duplex/single-strand junction. Although Pol β has gap-filling activity on gapped DSB substrates (25Tseng H.-M. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45630-45637Abstract Fu"

https://openalex.org/W1993555998,"Protein targeting mechanisms in flagellated protozoan parasites have received considerable interest because of a huge bias in these organisms toward the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor as a mechanism for the membrane attachment of cell surface macromolecules. In this study, the trafficking of invariant surface glycoprotein 65 (ISG65), a family of type I transmembrane proteins, was examined. Analysis of the C-terminal domains of ISG65 family members demonstrated a high level of conservation and, in particular, the presence of three lysine residues contained within the cytoplasmic tails of all ISG65s. ISG65 was expressed on the cell surface, in agreement with earlier work, but an intracellular pool of ISG65 was also detected within a Rab5A early endosome. Transplantation of the C-terminal 74 amino acids of ISG65 (encompassing the 23 C-terminal residues of the extracellular domain, the transmembrane peptide, and the cytoplasmic domain) onto the N-terminal domain of BiP (BiPN) was sufficient to target the chimera to the same internal compartments as native ISG65. Further, site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the cytoplasmic tail was required for endoplasmic reticulum exit and that at least two of the cytoplasmic domain lysine residues are needed for endosomal targeting, as removal of all three led to surface expression. Kinetic measurements demonstrate that the BiPN fusion protein (containing the ISG65 C terminus) has a short half-life, indicating rapid turnover. In contrast, BiPN fusion proteins containing a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor instead of the ISG65 C-terminal region are stably expressed on the surface, confirming the requirement for the ISG65 sequence for endosomal targeting. We suggest that the lack of surface expression of the BiPN-ISG65 fusion protein is likely due to more efficient internalization compared with ISG65. Taken together, these data demonstrate the presence of a lysine-dependent endocytosis signal in the ISG65 family. Protein targeting mechanisms in flagellated protozoan parasites have received considerable interest because of a huge bias in these organisms toward the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor as a mechanism for the membrane attachment of cell surface macromolecules. In this study, the trafficking of invariant surface glycoprotein 65 (ISG65), a family of type I transmembrane proteins, was examined. Analysis of the C-terminal domains of ISG65 family members demonstrated a high level of conservation and, in particular, the presence of three lysine residues contained within the cytoplasmic tails of all ISG65s. ISG65 was expressed on the cell surface, in agreement with earlier work, but an intracellular pool of ISG65 was also detected within a Rab5A early endosome. Transplantation of the C-terminal 74 amino acids of ISG65 (encompassing the 23 C-terminal residues of the extracellular domain, the transmembrane peptide, and the cytoplasmic domain) onto the N-terminal domain of BiP (BiPN) was sufficient to target the chimera to the same internal compartments as native ISG65. Further, site-directed mutagenesis indicated that the cytoplasmic tail was required for endoplasmic reticulum exit and that at least two of the cytoplasmic domain lysine residues are needed for endosomal targeting, as removal of all three led to surface expression. Kinetic measurements demonstrate that the BiPN fusion protein (containing the ISG65 C terminus) has a short half-life, indicating rapid turnover. In contrast, BiPN fusion proteins containing a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor instead of the ISG65 C-terminal region are stably expressed on the surface, confirming the requirement for the ISG65 sequence for endosomal targeting. We suggest that the lack of surface expression of the BiPN-ISG65 fusion protein is likely due to more efficient internalization compared with ISG65. Taken together, these data demonstrate the presence of a lysine-dependent endocytosis signal in the ISG65 family. The cell surface of the African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, is dominated by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; ISG, invariant surface glycoprotein; VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; TLCK, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone; HA, hemagglutinin; BiPN, N-terminal domain of BiP; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TM, transmembrane; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. 1The abbreviations used are: GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; ISG, invariant surface glycoprotein; VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; TLCK, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone; HA, hemagglutinin; BiPN, N-terminal domain of BiP; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TM, transmembrane; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole.-anchored proteins (1Grunfelder C.G.

Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1988; 239: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). VSG occupies most of the surface membrane area forming a densely packed monolayer (3Overath P.

Ferguson M.A. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Numerous proteins are present on the trypanosome cell surface in addition to VSG, albeit at lower densities, and include membrane transporters, proteases, and receptors (5El-Sayed N.M. Donelson J.E.

Several families of cell surface proteins of unknown function, referred to as invariant surface glycoproteins (ISGs), are expressed exclusively in the bloodstream form (8Ziegelbauer K. Multhaup G.

ISG100 is a polytopic protein partly resident within the endosomal system (11Nolan D.P. Jackson D.G. Windle H.J. Pays A. Geuskens M. Michel A. Voorheis H.P. Pays E. J. Biol.

Boothroyd J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 81: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The trypanosome surface is rapidly turned over by a highly active endocytic system, which serves to internalize nutrients, including transferrin and low-density lipoprotein via specialized receptors. Significantly, VSG is also rapidly recycled (1Grunfelder C.G. Engstler M. Weise F. Schwarz H. Stierhof Y.D. Boshart M. Overath P. Traffic. 2002; 3: 547-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Grunfelder C.G. Engstler M. Weise F. Schwarz H. Stierhof Y.D. Morgan G.W. Field M.C. Overath P. Mol. Biol.

Parasitol. 1998; 91: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), but the long half-life of VSG suggests that the protein is capable of multiple rounds of recycling (16Seyfang A. Mecke D. Duszenko M. J. Protozool. 1990; 37: 546-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).The dominant mechanism of endocytosis in trypanosomes is mediated by clathrin, and this occurs exclusively from the flagellar pocket region (1Grunfelder C.G. Engstler M. Weise F. Schwarz H. Stierhof Y.D. Boshart M. Overath P. Traffic. 2002; 3: 547-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Allen C.L. Goulding D. Field M.C. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4991-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). VSG is not concentrated during incorporation into clathrin-coated pits, probably because of the high density on the cell surface precluding further concentration. Significantly, T. brucei lacks the genes for both the AP-2 complex and an endocytic dynamin (14Grunfelder C.G. Engstler M. Weise F. Schwarz H. Stierhof Y.D. Morgan G.W. Field M.C. Overath P. Mol.

Selectivity is present as distinct cargo molecules are located in early endosomes as defined by Rab5A and Rab5B (12Pal A. Hall B.S. Nesbeth D.N. Field H.I. Field M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9529-9539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The mechanism for sorting is not known, but we have suggested that segregation may be based on the mode of membrane attachment (12Pal A. Hall B.S. Nesbeth D.N. Field H.I. Field M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9529-9539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A putative signal for delivery of the flagellar pocket protein CRAM to the cell surface has been reported (20Morgan G.W. Goulding D. Field M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10692-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Here we have used the ISG65 family to initiate investigation of transmembrane domain surface protein trafficking in bloodstream-form trypanosomes. Sequences related to defined tyrosine-containing endocytic signals, e.g. NPXXY and YKRF (21Yang H. Russell D.G. Zheng B. Eiki M. Lee M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5149-5163Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), are not present. Hence, if ISG65 does contain internalization motifs, these are likely to be distinct from those in metazoans and yeast. The ISG65 family has a highly conserved C-terminal region, particularly in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions, and includes three conserved lysines. Interestingly, conserved lysine residues are also found in the cytoplasmic domain of ISG75 (22Barak L.S. Tiberi M. Freedman N.J. Kwatra M.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2790-2795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not in the flagellar pocket-located transmembrane protein CRAM (20Morgan G.W. Goulding D. Field M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10692-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To facilitate examination of the roles of the ISG65 C termini in protein targeting, we created a panel of fusion proteins containing the ISG65 C terminus attached to the N-terminal domain of BiP (23Ziegelbauer K. Rudenko G. Kieft R. Overath P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Further, creation of a set of deletion and substitution mutants allowed dissection of trafficking signals within the ISG65 cytoplasmic domain. In addition, we revisited the hypothesis that the mode of membrane attachment functions to direct proteins to specific early endosomal compartments.MATERIALS AND METHODSSource and Culture of Bloodstream Forms of T. brucei—Bloodstream forms of MITat 1.2, derived from Lister strain 427 and expressing VSG 221, were cultured in HMI-9 medium (24Bangs J.D. Brouch E.M. Ransom D.M. Roggy J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18387-18393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), at 37 °C at 5% CO2 in medical flats (Corning) in a humid atmosphere. Continued expression of VSG 221 was checked periodically by immunofluorescence and always approached 100%. The cells were quantitated with a Z2 Coulter Counter (Coulter Electronics) and maintained at densities between 105 and 5 × 106 cells/ml. Mutant trypanosomes were maintained in HMI-9 selection medium with 2.5 μg/ml G418 (Sigma) or phleomycin (Invitrogen), as was appropriate, for expression of ectopic ISG constructs.Nucleic Acid and Recombinant DNA Methods—Standard molecular biology methods were carried out as described previously (25Hirumi H. Hirumi K. J. Parasitol. 1989; 75: 985-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), unless otherwise indicated. Plasmids were grown in Escherichia coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene), unless otherwise described, following electroporation with a BTX600 ECM electroporator. PCR was performed using a 480 Thermal Cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with Herculase polymerase (Stratgene) and gel-embedded DNA purified using GeneClean (BIO101). The cloning vector pCR-Script was from Promega. The plasmids were prepared by using the Mini-prep spin kit (Qiagen). Oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Genosys and are detailed in Table I.Table ISequences of synthetic oligonucleotides used in this study.

The bloodstream-form expression vector pXS5BiPN, containing a Geneticin cassette and an HA9-tagged N-terminal (ATPase) BiP cassette (BiPN-HA9), was a gift generously given by J. Bangs, University of Wisconsin (23Ziegelbauer K. Rudenko G. Kieft R. Overath P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The C terminus of the BiPN-HA9 cassette was fused to either a GPI signal or transmembrane sequences using flanking NheI and EcoRI restriction sites. All these C-terminal signal sequences were generated by PCR from the genomic DNA of trypanosomes. The GPI signal sequence from VSG 117 (GPI(S)) was amplified using primers FwGpi117/RevGpi117. To ensure that processing of the GPI signal was not affected by being placed in an aberrant context, we also made a longer construct, GPI(L) with a 30-bp extension at the 5′-terminus, which was amplified using FwGL117/RevGpi117. The fragments were restricted by EcoRI and NheI and then ligated into pXS5BiPN to yield pXS5BiPNGPI(S) and pXS5BiPNGPI(L). Amplification of the C-terminal transmembrane (TM) sequence of ISG65 was performed with the primers FwTm/RevTm. The product was cloned into pXS5BiPN to generate pXS5BiPNTM. Sequencing confirmed that the construct corresponded to ISG65f and ISG65g isoforms (Fig. 1A). Deletions in the TM were made by reverse PCR of the whole pXS5BiPNTM. Three deletions in the cytoplasmic domain of TM were made with the forward primer FwBiPN and three reverse primers, RevTMD2, RevTMD4, and RevTMD5, to generate pXS5BiPNTMΔ49-74, pXS5BiPNTMΔ58-74, and pXS5BiPNTMΔ66-74, respectively. pXS5BiPNTMΔ1-23 was generated with primers FwTmD1/RevBiPN to remove the ISG ectodomain region. pXS5BiPNTMΔ1-23Δ49-74 was made with primers FwTMD1/RevBiPN on the template pXS5BiPNTMΔ1-23. For introducing Lys to Arg mutations, five fragments with lysine substitutions were generated from pXS5BiPNTM by using the following primers: FwTMK1/RevTM for Lys-1, FwTM/RevTMK2 for Lys-2, FwTM/RevTMK3 for Lys-3, FwTM/RevTMK4 for Lys-4, and FwTM/RevTMK234 for Lys-234. Fragments were restricted and ligated into prepared pXS5BiPN vector. All constructs were verified by standard sequencing methods (MWG Biotech) prior to introduction into trypanosomes and were further verified by Western blotting.Protein Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—Trypanosomes were harvested and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma). Pellets (107 cells) were lysed in 100 μl of boiling sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using a wet transfer tank (Hoefer Instruments). Equivalence of loading was verified by Ponceau Red (Sigma) staining of nitrocellulose membranes following transfer. Nonspecific binding was blocked with TBST (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris base, pH7.4, 0.2% Tween 20) supplemented with 5% freeze-dried milk. Antibodies were also diluted in TBST-milk. Rabbit polyclonal sera against anti-ISG65, anti-TbBiP (gift of J. Bangs, Madison, Wisconsin), and VSG 221 were diluted 1:10,000 in TBST-milk. A commercial monoclonal anti-HA9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used at 1:10,000. Incubations with commercial secondary anti-IgG rabbit or anti-IgG mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugates (Sigma) were performed at 10,000-fold dilution in TBST-milk. Bound antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence using the Amersham ECL detection system on Biomax MR-1 films (Kodak).Immunofluorescence Analysis—Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D. Seidman J.G. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 2003Google Scholar). Antibodies were used at the following dilutions: rabbit and mouse anti-HA9 epitope IgG (both from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:1000, rabbit anti-ISG65 at 1:1000, rabbit anti-TbRAB5A (anti-5A, 12) at 1:100, rabbit anti-TbRAB11A (anti-11, 27) at 1:1000, mouse anti-p67 (anti-p67, J. Bangs, Madison) at 1:1000, rabbit anti-BiP at 1:1000 and rabbit anti-VSG 221 at 1:1000. The anti-ISG65 antisera do not recognize the chimeric BiPNTM constructs, as only the extracellular region, not including the sequences expressed here, was used to raise the antisera. This was confirmed by Western analysis (data not shown). Secondary antibodies, anti-rabbit Cy3 (Sigma) and anti-mouse Oregon Green (Molecular Probes), were used according the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were examined on a Nikon Eclipse E600 epifluorescence microscope fitted with optically matched filter blocks and a Photometrics CoolSnap FX CCD camera. Digital images were captured at 24-bit gray scale using Metamorph V3 (Universal Imaging Corp.) on a WindowsXP computer (Microsoft Inc.), and the resulting images were false-colored, merged, and assembled in Adobe PhotoshopCS (Adobe Systems Inc.).Antibody Uptake—To stain for ISG65 and VSG 221 internalized into the cell, endocytosis of rabbit antiserum against either ISG65 or VSG 221 was allowed in living cells as follows. Bloodstream-form cells were harvested from 50-ml cultures at 1-2 × 106 cells/ml, pelleted at 800 × g for 10 min, washed twice in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold serum-free HMI-9. The cells were incubated with 20 μl of anti-ISG65 or 10 μl of anti-VSG 221 at 4 °C for 30 min, and the cells were washed three times with ice-cold TES at 14,000 rpm for 20 s in a refrigerated microcentrifuge (Eppendorf) and resuspended in HMI-9 and incubated for 0, 5, 10, and 20 min at 37 °C in 1.5-ml microtubes. The cells were again pelleted in the refrigerated microcentrifuge, and paraformaldehyde was immediately added to a final concentration of 3.5% for 30 min to fix the cells. The cells were then washed, spotted onto slides, permeabilized, blocked, and stained with Cy3-tagged anti-rabbit antibody as above.GPI-phospholipase C (GPIPLC) Assay—1 × 107 cells were resuspended in 200 μl of ice-cold water containing 0.1 mm TLCK and held on ice for 5 min. After centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was discarded. The cell ghosts were resuspended in 200 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 mm TLCK. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the sample was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant (S) and pellets (P) analyzed by Western blotting (see Fig. 3). This protocol quantitatively solubilizes cell surface GPI-anchored VSG during the 37 °C incubation by activating endogenous GPI-phospholipase C, which is GPI-specific under these conditions (28Jeffries T.R. Morgan G.W. Field M.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2617-2626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Bangs J.D. Andrews N.W. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 255-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Most cytoplasmic proteins are released in the initial 0 °C lysis step.Fig. 3BiPNGPI constructs contain a GPI anchor. Trypanosome lysates from untransfected parasites or cells expressing various BiPN constructs were subjected to a GPI-PLC release (see “Materials and Methods”), which converts GPI-anchored proteins to soluble forms (S). Uncleaved and transmembrane (TM) proteins are found in the pellet (P). VSG 221 and ISG65 were probed with the relevant antisera, and BiPN constructs were localized with anti-HA9. Migration positions of molecular mass markers are indicated at left in kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Protein Stability—Trypanosomes were cultured for up to 4 h in HMI-9 medium containing 50 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) to prevent translation. The samples were taken at different time points and analyzed by Western blot. Data were quantitated by scanning of x-ray films following chemiluminescence exposure on a Heidelberg 1200 scanner, followed by analysis with ImageJ (rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/download.html).Bioinformatics—Sequences were aligned using ClustalW with default settings. Secondary and tertiary structure prediction and modeling was done using PSORT II (30Butikofer P. Ruepp S. Boschung M. Roditi I. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and three-dimensional position-specific scoring matrix (31Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1823) Google Scholar) software. Predicted structures were loaded into iMOL (www.pirx.com/iMol) for further analysis and presentation.RESULTSThe ISG65 Family Has a Conserved C-terminal Region— ClustalW alignment of the C-terminal regions of eight ISG65 family members indicated that, despite considerable variability within the ectodomains, the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions are highly conserved (Fig. 1A). The predicted transmembrane regions are identical, and only a few conservative substitutions in the predicted cytoplasmic regions are found. Of additional interest was the presence of three fully conserved lysine residues in the cytoplasmic domain (red in Fig. 1A). Structural prediction using three-dimensional PSSM (31Nakai K. Horton P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 34-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1823) Google Scholar) suggested an open coiled structure for the cytoplasmic domain, with weak similarity to Tityus serrulatus toxin (Protein Data Bank, 1tsk) (32Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this predicted structure has lysine 62 fully exposed and therefore could present most of its sequence to cytosolic proteins for interaction (Fig. 1D).Design of ISG65 Reporter Constructs—ISG65 is most likely dimeric and encoded by a multigene family with a dimerization interface within the ectodomain. 2M. Carrington, unpublished data. This precludes the direct analysis of ISG65, as any mutant ISG65 isoform could form a heterodimer with endogenous ISG65. In addition, we have been unable to make ISG65 null mutants, and hence the experiments cannot be conducted in a null background. 2M. Carrington, unpublished data. Further, we wished to avoid any possibility of physiological interactions between the ISG65 ectodomain and other surface components. Therefore a set of chimeric reporter proteins were designed using the N-terminal domain of BiP (BiPN) (23Ziegelbauer K. Rudenko G. Kieft R. Overath P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 69: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), incorporating an HA epitope tag (Fig. 1B). BiPN is rapidly secreted from trypanosomes, indicating that the protein folds efficiently (33Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. McDowell M.A. Brouch E.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4285-4294Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). BiPN has the further advantage of not normally being present on the trypanosome cell surface.A full ISG65 transmembrane domain, including a short spacer region from the ectodomain to ensure preservation of correct membrane topology, was fused to BiPN (Fig. 1C, Bi-PNTM). A series of deletion constructs and substitution mutants, with one or more lysine residues changed to arginine, were also made (Fig. 1C). To compare the influence on intracellular transport of a GPI anchor versus a transmembrane domain, two GPI-anchored chimeric constructs containing the VSG 117 GPI signal sequence were made and designated Bi-PNGPI(S) and BiPNGPI(L). BiPNGPI(L) includes an additional eleven residues of the VSG C-terminal domain to allay concern that efficient processing at the ω site (underlined in Fig. 1B) could be prevented by close proximity to the BiPN domain (Fig. 1B).Expression of ISG65 Fusion Proteins in Trypanosomes—Following transfection and selection, lysates of transgenic parasites were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Anti-HA monoclonals did not detect protein in wild-type trypanosomes but did react with lysates from cells transfected with both of the GPI-anchored BiPN chimeras (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, these proteins were expressed as more than one species; for BiPNGPI(L), the majority of immunoreactivity migrated at ∼62 kDa rather than at ∼50 kDa, as predicted from the polypeptide molecular mass. A low abundance species was detected at this position on the blot, suggesting that the decreased migration was because of post-translational modification. Further, the BiPNGPI(S) chimera also presented as two bands, but in this case, the major form was the lower molecular mass species. As BiPN lacks an N-glycosylation site, the increased molecular mass is probably due to processing of the GPI anchor core glycan (34Pinheiro C.B. Marangoni S. Toyama M.H. Polikarpov I. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 405-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Both isoforms in each case were efficiently solubilized by endogenous GPI-PLC (Fig. 3) and migrated with apparently lower molecular mass, consistent with removal of diacylglycerol. Hence BiPNGPI(L) and BiPNG-PI(S) likely contain glycolipid anchors.Fig. 2Expression of BiPN constructs in bloodstream-form trypanosomes. A, GPI-anchored BiPN constructs.

However, the sequence pattern of the amino acids of that segment of seven amino acids located in the C-terminal portion of the α subunit is rather limited in BPDOs of natural occurrence. In this work, we have randomly mutated simultaneously four residues (Thr335-Phe336-Ile338-Ile341) of region III of Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 BphA. The library was screened for variants able to oxygenate 2,2′-dichlorobiphenyl (2,2′-CB). Replacement of Phe336 with Met or Ile with a concomitant change of Thr335 to Ala created new variants that transformed 2,2′-CB into 3,4-dihydro-3,4-dihydroxy-2,2′-dichlorobiphenyl, which is a dead end metabolite that was not cleaved by BphC. Replacement of Thr335-Phe336 with Ala335-Leu336 did not cause this type of phenotypic change. Regiospecificity toward congeners other than 2,2′-CB that were oxygenated more efficiently by variant Ala335-Met336 than by LB400 BPDO was similar for both enzymes. Thus structural changes that altered the regiospecificity toward 2,2′-CB did not affect the metabolite profile of other congeners, although it affected the rate of conversion of these congeners. It was especially noteworthy that both LB400 BPDO and the Ala335-Met336 variant generated 2,3-dihydroxy-2′,4,4′-trichlorobiphenyl as the sole metabolite from 2,4,2′,4′-CB and 4,5-dihydro-4,5-dihydroxy-2,3,2′,3′-tetrachlorobiphenyl as the major metabolite from 2,3,2′,3′-CB. This shows that 2,4,2′,4′-CB is oxygenated principally onto vicinal ortho-meta carbons 2 and 3 and that 2,3,2′,3′-CB is oxygenated onto meta-para carbons 4 and 5 by both enzymes. The data suggest that interactions between the chlorine substitutes on the phenyl ring and specific amino acid residues of the protein influence the orientation of the phenyl ring inside the catalytic pocket.

BPDO can oxygenate several polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners. The application of BPDO for efficient PCB degrading processes will require an expansion of the range of PCB substrates it can oxygenate. The catalytic oxygenation of biphenyl occurs normally on carbons 2 and 3 to generate the cis-2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl, which is dehydrogenated by the cis-2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 2,3-dehydrogenase encoded by bphB in strain LB400. The resulting catechol 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl is then cleaved by the 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase encoded by bphC in strain LB400. 2-Hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenyl-hexa-2,4-dienoic acid (HOPDA) is then hydrolyzed by the HOPDA hydrolase (BphD) to yield benzoate and 2-hydroxypentanoic acid (Fig. 1). Based on site-directed mutagenesis and family shuffling of genes, variant BPDOs with extended PCB degrading potency were obtained (6Barriault D. Plante M.M. Sylvestre M. J.

However, several persistent congeners that are of concern for health are not degraded, even by the most performing BPDO variants described to date. Amino acid residues of the C-terminal portion of the ISPBPH α subunit (BphA) were found to influence the substrate selectivity of the enzyme (6Barriault D. Plante M.M. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3794-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 7Brühlmann F. Chen W. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1999; 63: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8Kumamaru T.

Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3096-3103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A stretch of seven amino acid residues termed region III was of particular interest (6Barriault D. Plante M.M. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3794-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 9Mondello F.J. Turcich M.P. Lobos J.H. Erickson B.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3096-3103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of amino acids for region III of B. xenovorans LB400 BPDO, which is the wild-type enzyme exhibiting the highest PCB degrading potency, is Thr335-Phe336-Asn337-Asn338-Ile339-Arg340-Ile341 (4Erickson B.D. Mondello F.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2903-2912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence pattern of corresponding region is Ala335-Ile336-Asn337-Thr338-Ile339-Arg340-Thr341 in Pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes KF707 BphA1 (10Taira K. Hirose J. Hayashida S. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4844-4853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Gly335-Ile336-Asn337-Thr338-Ile339-Arg340-Thr341 in Comamonas testosteroni strain B-356 BphA (11Sylvestre M. Sirois M. Hurtubise Y. Bergeron J. Ahmad D. Shareck F. Barriault D. Guillemette I. Juteau J.M. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 174: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). KF707 BphA BPDO shares more than 95% homology with LB400 BphA (9Mondello F.J. Turcich M.P. Lobos J.H. Erickson B.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3096-3103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). KF707 BPDO and B-356 BPDO catalyze the oxygenation of a much narrower range of PCB congeners than LB400 BPDO. Nevertheless, replacement of region III of LB400 BphA by that of KF707 or of B356 created enzymes that oxygenated a much broader range of PCB congeners (6Barriault D. Plante M.M. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3794-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 8Kumamaru T. Suenaga H. Mitsuoka M. Watanabe T. Furukawa K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 9Mondello F.J. Turcich M.P. Lobos J.H. Erickson B.D. Appl. Environ.

This shows that region III amino acids are not the only ones influencing the catalytic activity toward chlorobiphenyl, but it also shows that the sequence pattern of region III of LB400 BphA is not optimal for catalytic activity toward chlorobiphenyls. In addition to their influence on the range of chlorobiphenyls used as substrate by the enzyme, amino acids of region III also appear to be implicated in regiospecificity toward 2,2′-CB. Thus Suenaga et al. (12Suenaga H. Watanabe T. Sato M. Ngadiman Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3682-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) found that replacing Ile336 of KF707 BphA with Phe as in LB400 BphA changed the regiospecificity toward 2,2′-dichlorobiphenyl (2,2′-CB) to favor production of 2,3-dihydroxy-2′-chlorobiphenyl. The ortho-substituted PCB congeners such as 2,2′-, 2,6-, and 2,6,2′,6′-CB are among the most resistant to microbial attack. LB400 BPDO is among the few BPDO of natural occurrence that can oxygenate 2,2′-CB efficiently (9Mondello F.J. Turcich M.P. Lobos J.H. Erickson B.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3096-3103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In previous work we found that evolved BPDOs selected for their ability to oxygenate 2,2′-CB at a higher rate than the parental LB400 BPDO were able to catalyze a broader range of PCB congeners than LB400 BPDO (6Barriault D. Plante M.M. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3794-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although the amino acid residues of region III BphA influence greatly the range of PCB congeners oxygenated by the enzyme, based on the alignment of sequences of BphAs that are found in data bases, the diversity of sequence patterns of this stretch of amino acids is rather limited (6Barriault D. Plante M.M. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3794-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this work, we have used an approach that combines a PCR-based method of random mutagenesis at targeted multi-sites plus DNA shuffling to create a library of BPDO variants that were randomly mutated simultaneously on four residues Thr335-Phe336-Asn338-Ile341 of region of LB400 BphA. The purpose of the work was to evaluate the extent of variation that can occur in region III of BphA of LB400 with no loss of activity toward 2,2′-CB and the influence of new sequence patterns on catalytic activity toward this congener and other chlorobiphenyls. One of the most potent variant of the library (variant p4) exhibited a higher turnover rate of oxygenation of 2,2′-CB, but its regiospecificity toward this congener was altered. The rates of metabolism and the metabolite profiles of this variant toward a range of chlorobiphenyl congeners were compared with those obtained when LB400 BPDO catalyzed the reaction. The data suggest that despite the fact that residues 335 and 336 exert a strong influence on the regiospecificity toward 2,2′-CB and on the turnover rate toward several congeners, the pattern of chlorine substitution on the PCB substrate imposes its orientation toward the catalytic active center. Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, and General Protocols—Escherichia coli DH11S (13Lin J.J. Smith M. Jessee J. Bloom F. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 718-7721PubMed Google Scholar) was used in this study. Plasmid pQE31[LB-400-bphAE], in which bphA was mutated to introduce an AvrII site at position 1354, was described previously (14Barriault D. Simard C. Chatel H. Sylvestre M. Can. J. Microbiol. 2001; 47: 1025-1032PubMed Google Scholar); it encodes for a fused His-tagged ISPBPH (14Barriault D. Simard C. Chatel H. Sylvestre M. Can. J. Microbiol. 2001; 47: 1025-1032PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hurtubise Y. Barriault D. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5828-5835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) carrying the His tag on BphA. Plasmid pYH31[LB400-bphF-GBC] was described previously (16Chebrou H. Hurtubise Y. Barriault D. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4805-4811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This plasmid encodes for the ferredoxin (BphF) and the ferredoxin reductase (BphG) components of LB400 BPDO and for 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl-2,3-dehydrogenase (BphB) and 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 2,3-dioxygenase (BphC) from B. xenovorans LB400, which are the second and third enzymes of the biphenyl catabolic pathway. The coupled reaction involving BPDO plus BphB and BphC transforms biphenyl into its yellow HOPDA. To construct pDB31[LB400-bphFG], bphFG was amplified as a 1555-bp BamHI/KpnI fragment from LB400 DNA using antisense primers 5′-GCGGGATCCTATGAAATTTACCAGAGTTTG-3′ and 5′-CTGGTACCGCTTCACCTTTCA-3′ and then cloned into the BamHI/KpnI-digested pQE31. DNA general protocols were done according to Sambrook et al. (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA was sequenced by DNA Landmark (St-Jean, Canada). Preparation of DNA and PCRs to Evolve BPDO and Screening Protocol—Seven degenerated primers, each of which contained degenerated nucleosides at positions to be mutated, were used with appropriate antisense primers to amplify fragments of LB400-bphAE that overlapped over the stretch of DNA that encode for region III (Fig. 2). Primers 1 and 2 were used in conjunction with the reverse primer 3 to amplify the 1065-bp fragments A and B that corresponded to the right end portion of bphA plus bphE. Primer 1 and 2 were degenerated at bp positions 1021, 1022, and 1023 to introduce a mutation to replace Ile341 of the protein by any other amino acid. In addition, primer 1 was degenerated at position 1008, and primer 2 was degenerated at bp position 1007. The base pairs at positions 1007 and 1008 belong to the codon encoding amino acid 336 (Phe) of the protein. Fragment A and B extended from the beginning of the DNA stretch that encoded for region III of BphA (sequence Thr335-Phe336-Asn337-Asn338-Ile339-Arg340-Ile341) to the end of the gene. The five other primers, primers 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, containing degenerated nucleotides were used in conjunction with primer 9 to amplify a 1023-bp fragment that corresponded to the left end portion of bphA. These five sets of primers amplified DNA fragments C, D, E, F, and G that extended from the beginning of bphA to bp position 1023, which corresponded to the end of region III of BphA (Fig. 2). Therefore fragments C, D, E, F, and G overlapped with fragment A and B inside the DNA stretch that encoded region III. Primer 4 was degenerated at bp positions 1006, 1007, and 1008 to mutate Phe336 of the protein; primer 5 was degenerated at bp positions 1003, 1004, and 1005 to mutate Thr335 of the protein; primer 6 was degenerated at bp positions 1012, 1013, and 1014 to mutate Asn338 of the protein; primer 7 was degenerated at bp positions 1003, 1005, 1006, and 1008 to mutate Thr335 and Phe336 together; and primer 8 was degenerated at bp positions 1006, 1008, 1011, and 1014 to mutate Phe336 and Asn338 together. The seven fragments that overlapped inside region III were shuffled to generate a library of 1238-bp fragments (Fig. 3). The DNA fragments were treated with DNase I to prepare the 50–100-bp fragments for DNA shuffling (18Stemmer W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10747-10751Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Taq DNA polymerase was used for the primerless PCR step. The conditions were set as recommended by Roche Applied Science except that the program was as follows for 60 cycles: 94 °C for 45 s, 42 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min. The primerless PCR product was PCR-amplified using the following antisense oligonucleotides 10 (5′-ACGGCTGGGCCTACGACATC-3′) and 11 (5′-CTGCGCTTCGCGGTAGTAGAACTGC-3′). Taq DNA polymerase was used, setting conditions as recommended by Roche Applied Science. The resulting library of 1238-bp fragments was digested with MluI and AvrII, and the resulting 864-bp MluI/AvrII fragments were ligated to pQE31[LB400-bphAE] previously deleted from its MluI/AvrII fragment. The library of plasmids was transformed into E. coli DH11S pYH31[LB400-bphF-GBC] cells that expressed the entire set of enzymes required to convert chlorobiphenyls into corresponding choro-HOPDAs. Transformants were inoculated on nylon membranes on the surface of LB agar plates (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). After 18 h of incubation at 37 °C, the membranes were transferred to fresh LB plates containing 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), the plates were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, and then crystals of 4-CB or of 2,2′-CB were placed into the lid of the Petri dishes. 4-CB is a chlorobiphenyl congener that is normally oxidized at rate similar or higher than biphenyl by most BPDOs of natural occurrence, including LB400 BPDO (8Kumamaru T. Suenaga H. Mitsuoka M. Watanabe T. Furukawa K. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). It was therefore used to determine the proportion of the clones of the library expressing an enzyme for which the mutations that occurred in region III did not alter their capacity to oxygenate this easily oxidizable chlorobiphenyl. The plates were incubated at 37 °C, and colonies exposed to 2,2′-CB were periodically inspected visually over a period of 48 h to search for those that developed a stronger yellow color than a control expressing LB400 BphA. Whole Cell Assays to Evaluate the PCB Degrading Potency—E. coli DH11S pYH31[LB400-bphFGBC] + pQE31[bphAE] cells expressing variant BphAs were tested for their ability to degrade a synthetic mix of 18 PCBs using a protocol published previously (6Barriault D. Plante M.M. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3794-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The synthetic mix comprised 1 μm of each of the following congeners: 2,6-CB, 2,4,3′-CB, 2,4,4′-CB, 2,3,4′-CB, 2,6,2′,6′-CB, 2,5,2′,5′-CB, 2,3,2′,3′-CB, 2,4,2′,4′-CB, 2,4,3′,4′-CB, 3,4,3′,4′-CB, 3,4,3′,5′-CB, 2,3,4,2′,5′-CB, 2,4,5,3′,4′-CB, 2,4,5,2′,4′,5′-CB, 2,3,4,5,2′,5′-CB, and 5 μm of 3,3′-CB and 4,4′-CB. The internal standard 2,3,4,5,6,2′,3′,5′,6′-CB, presumed to be not degraded, was present at a concentration of 1 μm. The chlorobiphenyls were obtained from ULTRAScientific (Kingstown, RI). Each experiment included control cultures of E. coli [pYH31bphFGBC] + [pQE31] that were run under conditions identical to the experimental cultures. All of the values reported in the present study are averages from triplicate experiments. Assays to Identify the Metabolites and Quantify the Catalytic Activity—Metabolites were analyzed from suspensions of IPTG-induced whole cells of E. coli [pDB31bphFG] + [pQE31bphAE]. In this case, log phase cells grown in LB broth were induced for 2 h with 0.5 mm IPTG and then washed and suspended to an optical density at 600 nm of 2.0 in M9 medium (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F.

The cell suspension was distributed by portions of 2 ml in 7-ml glass tubes covered with Teflonlined screw caps. Each tube received 10 μl of a 50 mm acetone solution of the appropriate chlorobiphenyl substrate. They were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C with shaking. Cell suspensions were extracted at neutral pH with ethyl acetate. The metabolites were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses of their butylboronate or trimethylsilyl derivatives (6Barriault D. Plante M.M. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3794-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Barriault D. Vedadi M. Powlowski J. Sylvestre M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In some cases, the dihydro-dihydroxy metabolites were oxidized by IPTG-induced cell suspensions of E. coli [pQE31 bphB] (19Barriault D. Vedadi M. Powlowski J. Sylvestre M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) following a protocol similar to the one described above. In some experiments, the metabolites were analyzed from catalytic oxygenation using reconstituted BPDO prepared from His-tagged purified enzymes components that were obtained following protocols published previously (2Hurtubise Y. Barriault D. Sylvestre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8152-8156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Catalytic activities were determined from measurement of substrate depletion recorded by GC-MS analysis (15Hurtubise Y. Barriault D. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5828-5835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Screening for BPDO Variants Able to Oxygenate 2,2′-CB—To randomly mutate targeted residues of region III simultaneously, we used the approach described under “Experimental Procedures” and summarized in Fig. 3. A library of E. coli transformants carrying pQE31[bphAE] plus pYH31[bphFGBC] was generated. Transformants were grown on nitrocellulose membranes and exposed to the vapors of a chlorobiphenyl. The screening assay was based on the production of yellow chloro-HOPDA by these transformants. In a first set of experiments, we found that 20% of the transformants were able to oxygenate the easily oxidizable 4-CB; 50% of them were unable to transform 2,2′-CB into the yellow chloro-HOPDA. Therefore approximately half of the variants that remained active toward 4-CB contained (a) mutation(s) that caused a loss of activity toward 2,2′-CB. 70,000 colonies of the library were exposed to 2,2′-CB vapors. Among the ∼7,000 yellow-colored colonies, only seven exhibited a clearly more intense color than control colonies expressing parental LB400 BPDO. Based on the assumption that variant exhibiting a higher turnover rate of reaction toward 2,2′-CB would produce larger amount of chloro-HOPDA from 2,2′-CB, we retained these colonies for further examination. We also noticed that a fraction of the 70,000 transformants examined exhibited a pinkish gray color rather than the expected yellow color when exposed to 2,2′-CB. The latter were presumed to generate a metabolite that BphC was unable to cleave. Therefore, these variants were expected to have changed their regiospecificity toward 2,2′-CB because it has been established that catalytic oxygenation of this congener by LB400 BPDO produces as major metabolite 2,3-dihydroxy-2′-chlorobiphenyl (20Haddock J.D.

All of the variants retained were examined for their capacity to degrade a mixture of 18 PCB congeners. Based on previous reports (20Haddock J.D. Horton J.R. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 20-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Arnett C.M. Parales J.V. Haddock J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 23Seeger M.

Microbiol. 1999; 65: 3614-3621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception of 2,5,2′,5′-CB and 2,3,2′,3′-CB, all chlorobiphenyls of the mix are metabolized at a low rate by purified preparations of LB400 BPDO or by E. coli clones expressing this enzyme. For this reason, under our experimental conditions the depletion levels of these congeners by IPTG-induced E. coli cells expressing LB400 BPDO was lower than 20% after 18 h of incubation. These levels of depletion were too low to report statistically significant variations and were therefore not reported precisely (Table I). The mix of 18 congeners did not contain 2,2′-CB because it was not discriminated from 2,6-CB by our GC-ECD chromatography setting, but its degradation was demonstrated in other experiments (see below).Table IPCB degrading potency of indicated variantsSequence patterns (variant designations)Degradation of indicated congeneraThe values are the percentages of depletion of each PCB congener of a mix of 18 added to a culture of E. coli DH11S/pYH31[LB400-bphFGBC]/pQE31[bphAE] expressing either one of the BphA variants.

Binding of the substrate to the SCFSkp2 complex catalyzes the conjugation of ubiquitin molecules to the bound substrate, resulting in multi-ubiquitination and rapid degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Using Skp2 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified UBP43 as a novel substrate for Skp2. UBP43 belongs to the family of ubiquitin isopeptidases and specifically cleaves ISG15, a ubiquitin-like molecule that is induced by cellular stresses, such as type 1 interferons (IFN), nephrotoxic damage, and bacterial infection. UBP43 was originally identified as an up-regulated gene in knock-in mice expressing an acute myelogenous leukemia fusion protein, AML1-ETO, as well as in melanoma cell lines treated with IFN-β. The phenotype of UBP43 knockout mice includes shortened life span, hypersensitivity to IFN, and neuronal damage, suggesting that tight regulation of ISG15 conjugation is critical for normal cellular function. In this study, we demonstrate that UBP43 is ubiquitinated in vivo and accumulates in cells treated with proteasome inhibitors. We also show that Skp2 promotes UBP43 ubiquitination and degradation, resulting in higher levels of ISG15 conjugates. In Skp2–/–mouse cells, levels of UBP43 are consistently up-regulated, whereas levels of ISG15 conjugates are reduced. Our results demonstrate that the SCFSkp2 is involved in controlling UBP43 protein levels and may therefore play an important role in modulating type 1 IFN signaling.

Modification of proteins by ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like (Ubl) 1The abbreviations used are: Ubl, ubiquitin-like; SCF, Skp1, cullin, F-box protein; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; IFN, interferon; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; LRR, leucine-rich repeat; HEK, human embryonic kidney; HA, hemagglutinin; SCFSkp2, Skp1-Cul1-F-box protein Skp2. molecules, including SUMO, Nedd8, and ISG15, has emerged as a critical regulatory process in eukaryotes, controlling pathways such as the cell cycle, cellular stress response, intracellular signaling, development, and the immune response (1Hochstrasser M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E153-E157Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 2Kim K.I. Zhang D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Deregulation of ubiquitin or Ubl modification can cause autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, developmental abnormalities, and cancer. Conjugation of ubiquitin and Ubls involves a three-step mechanism initially demonstrated for ubiquitin as follows. A single E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme activates the Ubl molecule via formation of a thioester bond. Activated Ubl is then transferred to one of a large family of E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. In most cases, E2 enzymes are targeted to appropriate substrates by a class of substrate receptor complexes termed E3 ubiquitin ligases. Together, the E2 and E3 enzymes catalyze the formation of isopeptide bonds between ubiquitin and lysine residues on the target proteins. In the case of multiubiquitination, additional ubiquitin molecules are added to form ubiquitin chains. The multiubiquitinated proteins are then recognized and rapidly degraded into short peptides by the 26 S proteasome (3Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6907) Google Scholar, 6Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2922) Google Scholar). Modification by ubiquitin and Ubl molecules is a reversible process mediated by a large family of isopeptidases that exist to remove these molecules from their substrates. Although the function and regulation of these isopeptidases is poorly defined, the few that have been studied indicate an important role in growth and development (7Gray D.A. Inazawa J. Gupta K. Wong A. Ueda R. Takahashi T. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2179-2183PubMed Google Scholar, 8Huang Y. Baker R.T. Fischer V.J. Science. 1995; 270: 1828-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Specificity of the ubiquitin and Ubl pathways is conferred by the nature and activity of the E3 complexes. One of the beststudied E3 ligase complexes is the SCF complex. SCF complexes are composed of four subunits: the three core components Skp1, a Cullin family member, the RING finger protein Rbx1/Roc1, and one variable component, the F-box protein, that acts as the substrate recognition factor. A large number of F-box proteins have been identified in organisms ranging from yeast to humans. The mammalian F-box protein Skp2 may play a pivotal role in oncogenesis and has been implicated in degradation of several key regulators of cell proliferation including the tumor suppressor proteins p27Kip1, p57Kip2, (9Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar) and p130 (10Tedesco D. Lukas J. Reed S.I. Genes. Dev. 2002; 16: 2946-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and the replication factor, hORC1 (11Mendez J. Zou-Yang X.H. Kim S.Y. Hidaka M. Tansey W.P. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 481-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). We used the yeast two-hybrid technique to isolate potential Skp2-interacting proteins. We identified seven proteins, including UBP43, which will be described in this report. UBP43 belongs to the family of ubiquitin isopeptidases, one of the two classes of ubiquitin and Ubl deconjugating enzymes (12Schwer H. Liu L.Q. Zhou L. Little M.T. Pan Z. Hetherington C.J. Zhang D.E. Genomics. 2000; 65: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). UBP43 was identified as strongly expressed mRNA in hematopoietic tissue from an acute myeloid leukemia mouse model (13Liu L.Q. Ilaria Jr., R. Kingsley P.D. Iwama A. van Etten R.A. Palis J. Zhang D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3029-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thereafter, UBP43 was identified as an up-regulated gene in melanoma cells treated with IFN-β and the protein kinase C activator MEZ. This treatment causes cells to irreversibly lose proliferation potential and begin progression toward terminal differentiation (14Kang D. Jiang H. Wu Q. Pestka S. Fisher P.B. Gene. 2001; 267: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). UBP43 functions as an isopeptidase responsible for cleaving the ubiquitin-like protein ISG15 from substrates (15Malakhov M.P. Malakhova O.A. Kim K.I. Ritchie K.J. Zhang D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9976-9981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Upon treatment of cells with type I IFN or lipopolysaccharide (LPS), ISG15, UBP43, and the ISG15 E1 enzyme, UBE1L, are rapidly up-regulated (16Malakhova O. Malakhov M. Hetherington C. Zhang D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14703-14711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). It seems that tight regulation of both the ISG15 conjugation and deconjugation pathways is required to ensure proper response to cellular stress. In UBP43 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), ISG15 cleavage from cellular substrates is strongly reduced, suggesting that UBP43 is the major ISG15 isopeptidase (17Ritchie K.J. Malakhov M.P. Hetherington C.J. Zhou L. Little M.T. Malakhova O.A. Sipe J.C. Orkin S.H. Zhang D.E. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2207-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). UBP43–/–MEFs demonstrate prolonged STAT1 signaling and IFN hypersensitivity, which is in accordance with data showing that signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 is an ISG15-modified protein (18Malakhov M.P. Kim K.I. Malakhova O.A. Jacobs B.S. Borden E.C. Zhang D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16608-16613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). These observations and the identification of UBP43 in the two tumor models suggest that UBP43 plays an important role in cellular proliferation and differentiation and that UBP43 levels need to be carefully controlled in cells. Indeed, UBP43 protein levels are regulated at the level of transcription (16Malakhova O. Malakhov M. Hetherington C. Zhang D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14703-14711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and post-translationally, as we show here, via the SCFSkp2-mediated ubiquitin pathway. DNA Constructs—Skp1, Skp2, and UBP43 were PCR-amplified using a human lymphocyte cDNA library (HL4006AE; BD Biosciences Clontech). Skp1 and Skp2 were cloned into MatchMaker (BD Biosciences Clontech) yeast two-hybrid vectors pGADT7 and pGBKT, respectively. All other plasmids were created with the GATEWAY cloning system using vectors from Invitrogen following manufacturer's protocols. The C-terminally V5-tagged UBP43 adenovirus construct was made using the pADeasy system (Qbiochem). Amplified clones were verified by sequencing. Antibodies—The Skp2 antibody used for immunoprecipitation was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. Skp2 (His-435) and Cdk2 (Glu-119) antibodies used in immunoblotting analysis were purchased from Santa Cruz. His, HA, and V5 antibodies were purchased from Amersham Biosciences, Babco, and Invitrogen, respectively. The affinity-purified polyclonal ISG15 antibody was kindly supplied by Dr. Arthur Haas and does not cross-react with ubiquitin (19Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Extracts—Unless stated otherwise, cells were harvested in mammalian lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) by scraping, incubating on ice for 10 min, and then centrifuging at 14,000g (40° C) for 15 min; the supernatant was retained. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The MatchMaker (BD Biosciences Clontech) yeast two-hybrid system was used to screen for Skp2-interacting proteins. Yeast strain AH109 was transformed with plasmid pGBKT-Skp2 containing full-length Skp2 fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. Transformed cells were streaked on plates lacking tryptophan to select for single clones. This strain was then transformed with a human lymphoma cDNA library (HL4006AE; Invitrogen) cloned into the vector pACT1 that fuses cDNAs to the GAL4 activating domain. 2 × 106 clones were screened on plates lacking histidine (+10 mm 3AT) or adenine and histidine (+10 mm 3AT). Interaction of positive clones was verified by retransforming clones into the original Skp2 bait strain and assaying for interaction. Skp2 and UBP43 constructs were then cloned into yeast expression vectors compatible with the ProQuest two-hybrid system from Invitrogen. Constructs were transformed into AH109 and screened on plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, or histidine (+30 mm 3AT). Production of Recombinant Proteins in Bacteria and GST Purification—Escherichia coli BL21 (Invitrogen) cells were used to express the vector, pDEST15 (Invitrogen) containing GST or a GST-Skp2 fusion protein. One liter of each strain was induced with 100 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside for 2 h. Protein was isolated using a 3× freeze-thaw protocol with a dry ice and ethanol bath. Extracts were purified over glutathione-Sepharose 4B matrix (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instructions. Extracts from HEK 293 cells transfected with indicated plasmids were added to the matrix. Bound fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies. Immunoprecipitation—80% confluent A549 cells on a 10-cm plate were infected with adenoviruses expressing Skp2 with an N-terminal FLAG tag, and UBP43 with a C-terminal V5 tag. Infection was confirmed with GFP. 36 h after infection, cells were harvested in mammalian lysis buffer. The lysate was subjected to a FLAG column (Sigma), and bound proteins were eluted with 1.5× FLAG peptide (Sigma) and subjected to Western blot analysis. Ubiquitination—Skp2 was subcloned into pDEST31 (Invitrogen) containing an N-terminal His6 epitope. UBP43 was subcloned into pDEST40 (Invitrogen) containing C-terminal V5 and His6 epitopes. HA-ubiquitin and His6-ubiquitin constructs were a gift from Dr. Rosalie Sears (Oregon Health and Sciences University, Portland, OR). A549 cells, transfected with indicated plasmids, were treated for 5 h with 10 μm MG132 (Calbiochem). 35S Pulse-chase—REF52 and A549 cells were infected with UBP43-V5 adenovirus for 20 h. Skp2 wild-type (+/+) and Skp2 knockout (–/–) primary MEFs were infected in the presence of Effectene reagent. Cells were then labeled for 30 min with 7 mCi of [35S]methionine, chased with media containing 5 mm methionine and 3 mm cysteine, washed, and collected at 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min. Cell extracts were denatured and then renatured for V5 immunoprecipitation with anti-V5 antibody from Invitrogen. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Proteasome inhibitors (5 μm MG132 + 5 μm lactacystin) were added 5 h before the pulse and maintained throughout the pulse and chase phases. IFN-β Treatment—Skp2 wild-type and Skp–/–MEFs were treated with 1000 units/ml mouse IFN-β, and extracts were harvested 24 h later. For cell growth measurements, 3.6 × 104 immortalized MEF cells were plated in six-well plates, treated with 500 units/ml of mouse IFN-β, and harvested in duplicate. For each time point, total viable cell number was assessed by counting with a hemacytometer. Trypan blue staining was used to identify dead cells. A minimum of 150 cells was counted per sample. UBP43 Interacts with Skp2—To identify Skp2-interacting proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen and obtained eight clones coding for putative Skp2 interacting proteins (see “Materials and Methods”). Sequencing of the cDNA inserts revealed two previously identified and five novel Skp2 interactors. In validation of our screen, we isolated Skp1 (two clones) and Cks1. Skp1 is the scaffold protein that anchors Skp2 to the SCF complex via the Skp2 F-box domain (18Malakhov M.P. Kim K.I. Malakhova O.A. Jacobs B.S. Borden E.C. Zhang D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16608-16613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Cks1 is a protein recently identified to interact with Skp2 and facilitate substrate recognition of p27 (20Schulman B.A. Carrano A.C. Jeffrey P.D. Bowen Z. Kinnucan E.R. Finnin M.S. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Pagano M. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 21Ganoth D. Bornstein G. Ko T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M. Hershko A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Of the other five clones isolated, we focused our attention on a clone coding for a C-terminal portion of UBP43. Both the UBP43 C terminus (amino acids 121–373) that was isolated in the original screen and full-length UBP43, but not the N terminus (amino acids 1–121), were able to interact with Skp2, as assayed by production of β-galactosidase and growth on plates lacking histidine (Fig. 1A). To further isolate the Skp2-interacting region of UBP43, we made successive C-terminal truncations of the 121–373 fragment (Fig. 1B). We located a region between amino acids 183 and 352 of UBP43 that seems to be involved in its interaction with Skp2. The deletion construct containing the entire C-terminal region (121–373) as well as a construct lacking the last 21 amino acids, fragment 121–352, demonstrated robust interaction. However, a construct containing amino acids 121–285 showed markedly reduced interaction. When fragment 121–183 was expressed, interaction with Skp2 was completely abrogated. We therefore conclude that the region between amino acids 121 and 285 of UBP43 is required for the interaction between UBP43 and Skp2. Skp2 Interaction with UBP43 Requires the Skp2 Leucine-rich Repeat (LRR) Domain—Next, we analyzed the interaction of UBP43 and Skp2 in vivo. Fig. 1C demonstrates that full-length Skp2 can co-immunoprecipitate UBP43 ectopically expressed in the human lung cancer cell line A549. A construct lacking the LRR and C terminus showed no binding to UBP43. However, constructs lacking the N terminus or both the N terminus and F-box regions but retaining the LRR and C terminus did associate with UBP43. The LRR region of Skp2 has been implicated in substrate binding. Our data thus suggest that UBP43 is a substrate of SCFSkp2. Skp2 and UBP43 Interact in Vitro—To verify the interaction of UBP43 with Skp2, we performed in vitro binding experiments. Escherichia coli that expressed GST-Skp2 or GST alone were bound to glutathione beads, followed by incubation with extract from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells that expressed ectopic UBP43. Fig. 1D shows that GST-Skp2, but not GST, binds to UBP43 in vitro. Levels of UBP43 Are Modulated by Skp2 and by Proteasome Inhibitors—Our finding that UBP43 interacts with the LRR domain of Skp2 suggested that UBP43 is a substrate of SCFSkp2. Therefore, UBP43 protein levels could be controlled by protein degradation. To address this question, we expressed Skp2 and UBP43 in HEK293 cells. UBP43 levels were strongly reduced when Skp2 was expressed (Fig. 2A, lane 2) compared with when UBP43 was expressed alone (lane 1). Because Skp2 functions in an E3 ligase complex that targets substrates for degradation by the 26 S proteasome, we next assayed whether UBP43 accumulates in cells that have been treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Indeed, under these conditions, robust UBP43 accumulation can be observed (Fig. 2A, lane 4). Together, these results suggest that UBP43 is degraded in the proteasome most likely by SCFSkp2-mediated ubiquitination. Levels of UBP43 and ISG15 Are Altered in Skp2–/–Cells—To test whether levels of UBP43 are increased in cells that are devoid of Skp2, we performed immunoblotting of primary, low passage MEF extracts derived from wild-type or Skp2–/–mice. As shown in Fig. 2B, UBP43 levels are significantly increased in Skp2–/–extracts (lane 2) compared with wild type (lane 1). Note that UBP43 levels are very low in unstimulated wild-type cells and are hardly detectable with the available antibody. We also observed a significant increase in steady-state UBP43 levels in Skp2–/–cells stimulated with LPS (data not shown). In addition to the increase in UBP43 levels in Skp2–/–cells, an increase in free ISG15 levels was observed (lane 2, arrowhead). This suggests that in the absence of Skp2, UBP43 levels are up-regulated, resulting in increased cleavage of ISG15 from substrates (see Fig. 5B) and a concomitant increase in free ISG15. Skp2 Enhances UBP43 Ubiquitination in Vivo—Proteasomal degradation of proteins is triggered by multi-ubiquitination of targeted polypeptides. To determine whether UBP43 is ubiquitinated in vivo, we transfected HEK293 cells with plasmids encoding Skp2, V5-tagged UBP43, and HA-tagged ubiquitin. UBP43, in the presence of overexpressed Skp2, appeared in higher molecular mass forms consistent with ubiquitination (Fig. 3A). These high molecular mass bands were intensified upon addition of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. Next, we performed immunoprecipitation with anti-V5 antibodies to capture UBP43 protein. High molecular mass bands were observed that were immunoreactive against anti-HA antibodies, indicating that these bands represented ubiquitinated UBP43 (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3). Ubiquitination was enhanced by ectopic Skp2 (lane 3) and was absent if either V5-UBP43 or HA-ubiquitin was omitted (lanes 1 and 4). If these high molecular mass bands correspond to ubiquitinated UBP43 species, then inhibition of the proteasome should result in an increase and possibly a shift to even higher molecular mass bands. This is indeed the case, as shown in Fig. 3C, lane 3. In this experiment, His-V5-tagged UBP43 was captured on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads under denaturing conditions, followed by immunoblotting against the HA tag on ubiquitin. Because in these experiments, the amount of transfected UBP43 was high compared with Skp2, we did not observe a significant reduction in UBP43 steady-state levels upon Skp2 co-transfection. We conclude that UBP43 is ubiquitinated in vivo. To test whether Skp2 can increase the amount of ubiquitinated UBP43, we infected normal rat embryo fibroblast (REF52) cells with V5-tagged UBP43 expressed from an adenovirus together with increasing levels of adeno-Skp2 virus. Fig. 3D shows that under proteasome inhibition conditions (MG132, lanes 3, 5, and 7), UBP43 ubiquitination is enhanced by increasing levels of Skp2. We kept the level of Skp2 at or near endogenous levels (data not shown), whereas UBP43 levels were higher to allow detection of ubiquitinated species. In conclusion, these experiments demonstrate that UBP43 is ubiquitinated in vivo by Skp2 and is then degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner. Skp2 Promotes Degradation of UBP43 in Vivo—Our results suggested that UBP43 levels were controlled by SCFSkp2-mediated degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. To measure UBP43 degradation rates in vivo, we performed pulse-chase experiments in adenovirus-UBP43 infected rat fibroblast (REF52) cells. UBP43 has a half-life of ∼60 min under unstressed conditions (Fig. 4A, lanes 2–5). Again, UBP43 is very hard to detect under these conditions; however, the GFP control lane (lane 1) clearly demonstrates the specificity of the UBP43 band. When cells were treated with a proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 4A, lanes 6–9), UBP43 was stabilized significantly. We obtained similar results in human A549 cells (data not shown). In addition, cycloheximide treatment of cultures followed by analysis of UBP43 protein levels confirmed the pulse-chase results (data not shown). Ectopic Skp2 expression resulted in accelerated degradation of UBP43 (data not shown). We repeated the pulse-chase analysis in low passage Skp2+/+ and Skp–/–primary MEFs. The half-life of UBP43 was ∼50 min in Skp2 wild-type cells compared with 120 min in knockout cells (Fig. 4, B and C). When Skp2 was re-expressed in the Skp2–/–cells, levels of UBP43 dropped dramatically at the 15-min time point and then remained at that low level for the rest of the chase period. We conclude that Skp2 can initiate rapid degradation of UBP43 via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Skp2 Activity Modulates the ISG15 Conjugation Pathway— ISG15 conjugation to substrates is induced upon IFN-β stimulation. To determine whether Skp2 has an effect on ISG15 conjugation by way of its regulation of UBP43, we overexpressed Skp2 in the A549 human lung carcinoma cell line. After treatment with LPS, cells overexpressing Skp2 showed a marked increase in ISG15 conjugation compared with cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 5A). On the other hand, Skp2–/–MEFs induced with IFN-β displayed a reduction in ISG15 conjugation (Fig. 5B) and an increase in free ISG15 (Fig. 2B) compared with wild-type MEFs. We conclude that Skp2 can modulate the level of ISG15 conjugates, most likely via degradation of UBP43. Cells from UBP43–/–mice exhibit increased levels of ISG15 conjugates; these animals are hypersensitive to induction of the type I IFN pathway (17Ritchie K.J. Malakhov M.P. Hetherington C.J. Zhou L. Little M.T. Malakhova O.A. Sipe J.C. Orkin S.H. Zhang D.E. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2207-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Therefore, we would expect that Skp2–/–cells, which have reduced levels of ISG15 conjugates, might be more resistant to the growth-inhibiting effects of IFN-β treatment. To test this, we analyzed the sensitivity of Skp2–/–cells toward IFN-β. Skp2 wild-type cells showed a marked reduction in cell growth 24 h after IFN-β reduction (Fig. 5C). In contrast, the growth rate of Skp2–/–cells was unaffected by IFN-β induction at 24 h. These data suggest that absence of Skp2 decreases or delays the response to IFN-β, most likely because of the higher levels of UBP43 observed (Fig. 2B). The biological function of ISG15 modification is not well understood. It is clear, however, that carefully controlled ISG15 conjugation and deconjugation to substrates is crucial for the health of a cell and of an organism. This suggests that the level and activity of enzymes that control ISG15 modification, including UBE1L and UBP43, need to be tightly regulated. Indeed, mice lacking UBP43 are short-lived, develop neuronal injury, exhibit hypersensitivity to IFN, and demonstrate increased apoptosis in hematopoietic tissues (17Ritchie K.J. Malakhov M.P. Hetherington C.J. Zhou L. Little M.T. Malakhova O.A. Sipe J.C. Orkin S.H. Zhang D.E. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2207-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). On the other hand, ectopic expression of UBP43 blocks monocyte differentiation in cell culture (13Liu L.Q. Ilaria Jr., R. Kingsley P.D. Iwama A. van Etten R.A. Palis J. Zhang D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3029-3038Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, the E1 enzyme for ISG15, UBE1L, is absent in all 14 lung cancers examined for UBE1L expression, suggesting that the lack of ISG15 conjugation contributes to malignant transformation. Cellular levels of UBP43 are controlled at the level of transcription by LPS and IFN type 1 induction (14Kang D. Jiang H. Wu Q. Pestka S. Fisher P.B. Gene. 2001; 267: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16Malakhova O. Malakhov M. Hetherington C. Zhang D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14703-14711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase controls the UBP43 protein level by ubiquitin-mediated degradation via the proteasomal pathway. Our data demonstrate that Skp2 binds to UBP43 and initiates its multi-ubiquitination, resulting in UBP43 degradation via the proteasome. In MEFs lacking Skp2, levels of free ISG15 are high, and ISG15 conjugates are low, consistent with increased UBP43 levels. On the other hand, high levels of Skp2 result in an increase in ISG15-conjugated proteins. It was interesting that upon LPS treatment, UBP43 protein was stabilized, an effect that was countered by high Skp2 levels (data not shown). The coordinated induction of both ISG15 conjugating and deconjugating pathways suggests that ISG15 modification is a dynamic process that needs to be carefully controlled for normal cellular function and viability. Indeed, ectopic expression of ISG15 in various cell types initiates apoptosis. 2S. Lanker, unpublished observations. In this context, Skp2-mediated degradation might play a fine-tuning role to adjust the levels of UBP43 according to the growth and stress conditions of a cell. Skp2 itself is regulated at the level of transcription and protein degradation (22Spruck C. Strohmaier H. Watson M. Smith A.P. Ryan A. Krek T.W. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 23Sutterluty H. Chatelain E. Marti A. Wirbelauer C. Senften M. Muller U. Krek W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Skp2 protein is absent in G0 and early G1 cells, rises as cells enter S phase, and declines in mitosis. We have observed an inverse correlation between Skp2 and ectopic UBP43 levels in synchronized A549 cells (data not shown), consistent with the role of Skp2 in degrading UBP43. We have not yet been able to follow endogenous UBP43 levels through the cell cycle, mainly because UBP43 levels are very low in cells not treated with IFN or LPS, and the available antibody does not detect endogenous UBP43. Our data do not exclude the possibility that more than one F-box protein participates in the degradation of UBP43; indeed, in Skp2–/–cells, UBP43 is still fairly unstable, with a half-life of about 2 h (Fig. 4C). However, UBP43 steady-state levels are greatly increased in Skp2–/–cells, and Skp2 reexpression reduces the levels back to normal, arguing that Skp2 does have a major effect on UBP43 protein levels. The recognition of substrates by SCF complexes is often catalyzed by substrate phosphorylation at particular residues (24Wirbelauer C. Sutterluty H. Blondel M. Gstaiger M. Peter M. Reymond F. Krek W.

In addition, the adapter protein Cks1 was shown to be required for efficient targeting of p27 and p130 (20Schulman B.A. Carrano A.C. Jeffrey P.D. Bowen Z. Kinnucan E.R. Finnin M.S. Elledge S.J.

Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). We have preliminary evidence that UBP43 is phosphorylated, but whether phosphorylation is important for binding and whether Cks1 is needed for efficient interaction with Skp2 are under investigation. ISG15 conjugation plays an important role in stress response, and is also implicated in controlling cell proliferation and differentiation. It is noteworthy that influenza virus proteins inhibit ISG15 expression and conjugation, suggesting that ISG15 mediates antiviral activity (34Tsvetkov L.M. Yeh K.H. Lee S.J. Sun H. Zhang H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 661-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 35Yuan W. Krug R.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). It is intriguing that Skp2 controls the levels of cell cycle regulators and, as we show here, a factor in stress response. A connection between cell cycle control and stress response at the level of SCF-mediated degradation has been documented. For example, the yeast SCFCdc4 complex controls the CDK inhibitors Sic1 and Far1 as well as the transcription factor Gcn4 involved in the response to amino acid starvation. SCFGrr1 degrades G1 cyclins and has an important role in the cellular response to glucose starvation. It will be interesting to understand the molecular mechanism that ties Skp2 to cellular stress and the role of ISG15 conjugation in this process. Dissecting how Skp2 connects cell cycle control and cellular stress signaling will serve as a paradigm for similar pathways that integrate cell division and external signals. We thank F.

KSM-KP43, with a C-terminal extension domain, was determined by the multiple isomorphous replacements method with anomalous scattering. The native form was refined to a crystallographic R factor of 0.134 (Rfree of 0.169) at 1.30-Å resolution. KP-43 consists of two domains, a subtilisin-like α/β domain and a C-terminal jelly roll β-barrel domain. The topological architecture of the molecule is similar to that of kexin and furin, which belong to the subtilisin-like proprotein convertases, whereas the amino acid sequence and the binding orientation of the C-terminal β-barrel domain both differ in each case. Since the C-terminal domains of subtilisin-like proprotein convertases are essential for folding themselves, the domain of KP-43 is also thought to play such a role. KP-43 is known to be an oxidation-resistant protease among the general subtilisin-like proteases. To investigate how KP-43 resists oxidizing reagents, the structure of oxidized KP-43 was also determined and refined to a crystallographic R factor of 0.142 (Rfree of 0.212) at 1.73-Å resolution. The structure analysis revealed that Met-256, adjacent to catalytic Ser-255, was oxidized similarly to an equivalent residue in subtilisin BPN′. Although KP-43, as well as proteinase K and subtilisin Carlsberg, lose their hydrolyzing activity against synthetic peptides after oxidation treatment, all of them retain 70–80% activity against proteinaceous substrates. These results, as well as the β-casein digestion pattern analysis, have indicated that the oxidation of the methionine adjacent to the catalytic serine is not a dominant modification but might alter the substrate specificities.

Subtilisin-like serine proteases (subtilases) are widely found in Archaebacteria, eubacteria, and eukaryotes. These enzymes are classified into the following six families: subtilisin, thermitase, proteinase K, lantibiotic peptidase, kexin (pro-protein convertases), and pyrolysin. Extracellular and relatively unspecific subtilisin-like proteases function in the service of defense and nutrition. On the other hand, intracellular and highly specific enzymes play roles in the processing of proproteins and pro-peptides to mature functional proteins and peptides. The subtilisin family proteases are classified into three subfamilies: “true,” “high alkaline,” and “intracellular” subtilisins (1Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). True and high alkaline subtilisins, mainly secreted from Bacillus bacteria, are industrially important materials that improve the efficiency of laundry detergents. These enzymes are well studied as model enzymes in protein engineering. The crystal structures of various enzymes of the subtilisin family, such as subtilisin BPN′, Novo, Carlsberg, thermitase, and proteinase K, have already been determined (2Wright C.S. Alden R.A. Kraut J. Nature. 1969; 221: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 3Drenth J. Hol W.G. Jansonius J.N. Koekoek R. Eur. J.

Weber G. Saenger W. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1311-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Generally, the fold of subtilisins, referred to as the α/β hydrolase fold, consists of 8 α-helices and 9–11 β-strands. Four calcium ion binding sites are known in crystal structures of subtilisins, thermitase, and proteinase K (1Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). It is already known that the activities of these proteases are reduced by oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide, a component of bleach. These reagents oxidize a conserved methionine residue adjacent to a catalytic serine (7Stauffer C.E. Etson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 5333-5338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sulfoxide oxygen of the oxidized methionine residue orients to the oxyanion hole and destabilizes the tetrahedral intermediate (8Bott R. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A. Graycar T. Katz B. Power S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7895-7906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Replacing the methionine residue has been shown to improve resistance to oxidation, as based on the catalytic activity of the enzyme, but this type of mutation reduced their specific activities in the non-oxidized form of the enzyme (9Estell D.A. Graycar T.P. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6518-6521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A subtilisin-like alkaline serine protease, KP-43, has been isolated from Bacillus sp. strain KSM-KP43 (10Saeki K. Hitomi J. Okuda M. Hatada Y. Kageyama Y. Takaiwa M. Kubota H. Hagihara H. Kobayashi T. Kawai S. Ito S. Extremophiles. 2002; 6: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This protease also possesses the conserved methionine, but it resists oxidizing agents (10Saeki K. Hitomi J. Okuda M. Hatada Y. Kageyama Y. Takaiwa M. Kubota H. Hagihara H. Kobayashi T. Kawai S. Ito S. Extremophiles. 2002; 6: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Multiple amino acid sequence comparisons between KP-43 and related enzymes in the subtilisin family have indicated that KP-43 does not belong to any of the subfamilies of the subtilisin family (11Saeki K. Okuda M. Hatada Y. Kobayashi T. Ito S. Takami H. Horikoshi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In particular, KP-43 has several insertions and a C-terminal extension of 120 residues. The C-terminal half after the putative catalytic residue, Ser-255, is homologous to the internal segments of the serine protease/ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter precursors of the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum (10Saeki K.

To gain a better understanding of the structural features of KP-43 for oxidative stability and functions of the C-terminal region, we determined the crystal structures of the KP-43 protease in both the native and oxidized forms. Preparation of Native, Derivative, and Oxidized KP-43 Crystals— KP-43 from Bacillus sp. strain KSM-KP43 was purified as described previously (11Saeki K. Okuda M. Hatada Y. Kobayashi T. Ito S. Takami H. Horikoshi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and the enzyme was crystallized using a precipitant composed of 1.7 m ammonium sulfate, 10 mm calcium chloride, 10% (w/v) 1,4-dioxane, and 0.1 m HEPES-Na, pH 7.3 (14Nonaka T. Fujihashi M. Kita A. Saeki K. Ito S. Miki K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 717-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Five diffraction data sets were collected: two native crystals at 1.30- and 1.50-Å resolution (Nat1 and Nat2), the oxidized enzyme (Oxi), and platinum and samarium derivatives for phasing (see Table I). The oxidized KP-43 was prepared by treatment with 3.0% hydrogen peroxide in 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 9.0, for 2 h. The oxidized KP-43 was crystallized in a manner similar to that used for the native protein (14Nonaka T. Fujihashi M. Kita A. Saeki K. Ito S. Miki K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Native crystals were soaked for 9 days in stabilization buffer composed of 1.2 m ammonium sulfate, 10 mm CaCl2, 10% (v/v) 1,4-dioxane, and 0.1 m HEPES-Na (pH 7.3) with 1 mm K2[PtCl4]. The samarium derivatives were prepared by co-crystallization using crystallization buffer containing 2 mm SmCl3 instead of CaCl2.Table ISummary of the data collection, phasing and refinement of KP-43 proteaseData nameNat1Nat2SmPtOxiData collectionResolution (Å) aValues in parentheses are for the outermost resolution shell100–1.30 (1.32–1.30)100–1.50 (1.53–1.50)42.3–2.45 (2.54–2.45)25.1–1.80 (1.90–1.80)20.0–1.73 (1.79–1.73)Space groupC2221C2221C2221C2221C2221Cell a (Å)42.843.543.543.542.9Cell b (Å)109.0110.4110.5110.3109.2Cell c (Å)166.9169.0169.2168.7167.2BeamlineBL40B2BL6ABL44B2BL6ABL40B2Wavelength (Å)0.85001.00001.60001.00001.0000Temperature (K)100293293293100Reagent2 mm SmCl31 mm K2[PtCl4]Oxidized by 3.0% H2O2Soaking timecocrystallized9 daysRmerge (%) aValues in parentheses are for the outermost resolution shell,bRmerge = Σ|Ii – 〈Ii〉|/Σ 〈Ii〉, where Ii is the observed intensity and 〈Ii〉 is the average intensity over symmetry equivalent measurements5.3 (28.3)6.1 (27.7)10.3 (15.0)5.6 (18.1)5.7 (20.4)Completeness (%) aValues in parentheses are for the outermost resolution shell95.6 (90.5)91.1 (59.2)95.4 (88.9)99.9 (99.7)94.1 (78.7)No. of observed reflections (>1σ)451,512250,161111,167173,029228,539No. of unique reflections (>1σ)92,51159,45227,64438,17339,121Redundancy4.94.24.04.55.8I/σ(I) aValues in parentheses are for the outermost resolution shell17.8 (3.1)15.7 (3.0)12.7 (7.9)9.6 (3.6)22.0 (6.9)PhasingNo. of heavy atom sites22Resolution range (Å)20.0–2.4520.0–1.80Riso (%) cRiso = Σ‖FPH| – |FP‖/Σ|FP|, where FPH and FP are the derivative and native structure factors, respectively13.27.6Phasing power dPhasing power = 〈|FH|/‖FPH| – |FP + FH‖〉, where FH, FPH, and FP are the heavy atom, derivative and native structural factors, respectively (acentric/centric)1.27/1.020.68/0.63Curris ReCullis R = 〈‖FPH| – |FP + FH‖〉/〈‖FPH| – |FP‖〉 (acentric/centric)0.78/0.690.90/0.82Curris RanomalousfCullis Ranomalous = 〈|FPH (+) – FPH (–)| – 2FH sin αp〉 / 〈|FPH (+) – FPH (–)|〉, where αp is the protein phase0.700.87Mean figure of merit (all, 20–1.8 Å)0.29RefinementResolution range (Å)100–1.3026.0–1.5020.0–1.73R (%) gR = Σ ‖Fobs| – |Fcalc‖/Σ |Fobs|.

Crystals were soaked in cryoprotectant solution, which was prepared by the addition of 20% (w/v) glycerol to the stabilization buffer. The soaked crystals were frozen under a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. Data sets for phasing (Nat2, platinum, and samarium) were taken at room temperature. All the data sets were collected using synchrotron radiation at the following facilities: Nat1 and Oxi data sets at BL40B2 of SPring-8; samarium data sets at BL44B2 of SPring-8; and Nat2 and platinum data sets at BL6A at the Photon Factory of the High-Energy Accelerator Research Organization. Diffraction images were taken on Quantum 4R CCD detectors (Area Detector Systems Corp., Poway, CA) at BL40B2 of SPring-8 and BL6A at the Photon Factory, whereas a mar165 CCD detector (MAR Research, Norderstedt, Germany) was used at BL44B2 of SPring-8. All of the data sets were processed using the programs HKL2000 and DPS-MOSFLM (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38431) Google Scholar, 16Rossmann M.G. van Beek C.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Phasing, Model Building, and Refinement—The structure was determined by the multiple isomorphous replacement method with anomalous scattering using the data sets of Nat2, platinum, and samarium with the program MLPHARE from CCP4 (17Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19727) Google Scholar). The initial electron density map was improved using the program DM from CCP4 with solvent flattening (17Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19727) Google Scholar). An initial model was constructed using the program O, and this model was refined using the program CNS (18Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13005) Google Scholar, 19Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

Based on the resulting model, the high resolution structure and that of oxidized KP-43 were built and refined against the Nat1 and Oxi data sets, respectively. The final structures of Nat1, Nat2, and Oxi were refined using the program SHELX-97 with anisotropic B factors and multiconformation refinements (20Sheldrick G. Schneider T. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1877) Google Scholar). Assays of Remaining Activity and Substrate Specificity—Subtilisin Carlsberg, hemoglobin (bovine), and β-casein (bovine) were purchased from Sigma. Proteinase K and Glt-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-pNA 1The abbreviations used are: Glt-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-pNA, N-glutarylalanyl-alanyl-prolyl-leucil-p-nitroanilide; SPC, subtilisin-like proprotein convertases; Tricine, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine; PDB, Protein Data Bank. were purchased from Merck and the Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan), respectively. Ten mg each of KP-43, subtilisin Carlsberg, and proteinase K were dissolved in 9.0 ml of 0.1 m borate buffer at pH 9.0. Then, 1.0 ml of 30% (w/v) hydrogen peroxide was added to these solutions for oxidizing the sample at a H2O2 final concentration of 3.0% (∼0.88 M). Distilled water was used as a control sample instead of hydrogen peroxide. The samples were incubated at 303 K for 5, 10, 30, 60, and 120 min, and 500-μl aliquots of these solutions were mixed with 50 μl of 1.0 mg/ml catalase solution to decompose the hydrogen peroxide. All hydrolysis experiments involving the native and oxidized enzymes were carried out in phosphate or Tris-HCl buffer solution (pH 8.0) containing 0.2 mm CaCl2 at 303 K. The remaining proteolytic activity against urea-denatured hemoglobin was determined by the method of Anson (21Anson M.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1939; 22: 79-89Crossref Scopus (2401) Google Scholar) with slight modification, i.e. the concentrations of trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptides were measured as estimated by the absorbance at 280 nm. The remaining Glt-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-pNA hydrolyzing activity was measured as increases of absorbance at 405 nm from the produced p-nitroaniline. β-Casein (10 mg/ml) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl solution (with 2 mm CaCl2, pH 8.0) was digested by native and oxidized (for 60 min) subtilisins at 303 K for 5, 10, 30, and 60 min. In each reaction time, aliquots of these solutions were mixed with the same volumes of 1.0 m acetic acid to terminate the reactions. These solutions were neutralized by 4.0 n NaOH solution and were used for Tricine-SDS-PAGE analysis of the β-casein digestion patterns (22Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10449) Google Scholar). Data Collection, Phasing, Model Building, and Structure Refinement—Diffraction data from KP-43 crystals could be measured at room temperature utilizing synchrotron radiation. Crystals for the Nat1 and Oxi data sets were successfully frozen under a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K; the former crystal diffracted x-rays beyond 1.30-Å resolution at beamline BL40B2 at SPring-8. The details of the data collection are shown in Table I. Two samarium and two platinum atoms were found in isomorphous (and anomalous) Patterson maps of the samarium and platinum derivatives, respectively. Two samarium atoms were located at the calcium sites of Ca-I and Ca-II (see below), and two platinum atoms were bound to the Sδ atoms of Met-98 and Met-251. An initial model of Nat2 was constructed on the map improved by density modification at 2.5-Å resolution. All 434 residues were successfully assigned, and the initial model of Nat2 was refined to a crystallographic R factor of 0.185 at 1.5-Å resolution with isotropic B factors using the program CNS. The models of Nat1 (high resolution native form at 100 K), Nat2 (native form at room temperature), and the Oxi (oxidized) form were refined using the program SHELX-97 with anisotropic B factors and multiconformations to crystallographic R factors of 0.134 (Rfree of 0.169) at 1.30-Å resolution, 0.127 (Rfree of 0.168) at 1.50-Å resolution, and 0.142 (Rfree of 0.212) at 1.73-Å resolution, respectively. The results of the refinements with anisotropic B factor and multiconformations are summarized in Table I. The root mean square deviations from the ideal bond distances and the angle distances of the Nat1 structure were 0.012 and 0.029 Å, respectively (23Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2539) Google Scholar). In addition, 87.9% of the non-glycine residues of the Nat1 structure were in the most favorable regions of the Ramachandran plot (24Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). Overall Structure—The overall structure is shown in Fig. 1. KP-43 consists of two domains, a subtilisin-like α/β domain (N-domain) and a C-terminal jelly roll β-barrel domain (C-domain) (Fig. 1). The architecture of these two domains is similar to that of kexin and furin, both of which belong to the subtilisin-like proprotein convertases (SPCs), whereas the binding orientation and the amino acid sequence of the β-barrel domain both differ in each case (25Holyoak T. Wilson M.A. Fenn T.D. Kettner C.A. Petsko G.A. Fuller R.S. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6709-6718Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 26Henrich S. Cameron A. Bourenkov G.P. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Lindberg I. Bode W. Than M.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The N-domain consists of 11 helices and 10 β-strands and contains three catalytic residues, Asp-30, His-68, and Ser-255 (1Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The helix H9, in which the catalytic serine and residues forming the oxyanion hole are located, is one turn longer than the corresponding helix of known subtilisin-like proteases. On the other hand, the C-domain consists of two four-stranded antiparallel β-sheets (Fig. 1). The C-domain corresponds to the P-domain of kexin-like proteases (25Holyoak T. Wilson M.A. Fenn T.D. Kettner C.A. Petsko G.A. Fuller R.S. Ringe D. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6709-6718Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 26Henrich S. Cameron A. Bourenkov G.P. Kiefersauer R. Huber R. Lindberg I. Bode W. Than M.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 520-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). A search using the DALI server (www.ebi.ac.uk/dali) and the SCOP data base (scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/scop) revealed that the C-domain of KP-43 is topologically homologous with a portion of virus capsid proteins and certain β-xylanases. These N- and C-domains are connected with each other not only by hydrophobic interactions but also by hydrogen bonding. Eight water molecules are packed into two spaces between these domains.Fig. 2A comparison of the structures of KP-43 (blue, Nat1), subtilisin BPN′ complexed with the Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (red, PDB accession code, 2sic (34Takeuchi Y.

Therefore, we concluded that the C-domain is not closely related to the oxidative stability of KP-43. The β-barrel domain of SPCs, referred to as the “P-domain,” is essential to cleave the N-terminal pro-domain (27Gluschankof P. Fuller R.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2280-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The domain regulates the stability, the calcium dependence, and the pH dependence of convertases (28Zhou A. Martin S. Lipkind G. LaMendola J. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and contributes to the folding and thermodynamic stability of SPCs (29Ueda K. Lipkind G.M. Zhou A. Zhu X. Kuznetsov A. Philipson L. Gardner P. Zhang C. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5622-5627Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Aqualysin I, a subtilisin-like alkaline serine protease from Thermus aquaticus YT-1, is produced as a precursor composed of four domains, i.e. the N-terminal signal peptide, the N-terminal pro-domain, the mature enzyme domain, and the C-terminal pro-domain (30Terada I. Kwon S.T. Miyata Y. Matsuzawa H. Ohta T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6576-6581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal pro-domain of the aqualysin I precursor is thought to be an intramolecular chaperone that stabilizes the unfolded precursor to facilitate translocation through the cytoplasmic membrane (31Kim D.W. Lin S.J. Morita S. Terada I. Matsuzawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 32Kim D.W. Matsuzawa H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The wild-type KP-43 is secreted via the Bacillus subtilis expression system. However, the C-domain-truncated recombinant KP-43 could not be expressed in either the Escherichia coli or the B. subtilis expression system (data not shown). The C-domain of KP-43 has no sequential homology to the P-domain of the SPCs, but these two domains are nonetheless topologically similar to each other. On the other hand, the C-domain of KP-43 is partially homologous to the C-terminal pro-domain of the aqualysin I precursor. Moreover, according to the secondary structure predictions (33McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2685) Google Scholar), the C-terminal domains of both KP-43 and pro-aqualysin I consist of several β-strands. Therefore, the C-domain of KP-43 might also contribute to protein folding. KP-43 shares local similarity with the internal segments of a membrane-associated subtilisin-like serine protease from a marine microbial assemblage (NCBI accession numbers: AAF97188 and AF047370) and the cytoplasmic N-terminal outer membrane region of the serine protease/ABC transporters from D. discoideum (NCBI accession numbers: AAG11416, P54683, Q23868, and AAL74253) (11Saeki K. Okuda M. Hatada Y. Kobayashi T. Ito S. Takami H. Horikoshi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Shaulsky G. Kuspa A. Loomis W.F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1111-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 13Good J.R. Cabral M. Sharma S. Yang J. Van Driessche N. Shaw C.A. Shaulsky G. Kuspa A. Development. 2003; 130: 2953-2965Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These proteins are therefore thought to have evolved from a common ancestor (11Saeki K. Okuda M. Hatada Y. Kobayashi T. Ito S. Takami H. Horikoshi K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, the three-dimensional structure of KP-43 suggests that these transporters also consist of a subtilisin-like domain and a jelly roll β-barrel domain. These transporters and the SPCs might thus be structurally, functionally, and evolutionally related. Calcium Ion Binding Sites—It is well known that the Ca2+ ion promotes the thermal stability of the subtilisins. Three Ca2+ binding sites (Ca-I, Ca-II, and Ca-III) of the KP-43 molecule differ from the corresponding sites in the other known subtilisin-like proteases (Figs. 1 and 2). The Ca-I ion is located in the N-terminal domain, and the Ca-II and Ca-III ions are in the C-terminal domain (Fig. 1). In the native crystal (Nat1), these ions are found as peaks of over 16.0σ in the 2Fo - Fc map and of over 7.0σ in the anomalous Fourier map (amplitude, F(+) - F(-); phase, Fcalc - 90 degrees) (Fig. 3). The Ca2+ ions could be identified by their anomalous dispersion effects because the value of f ″ of calcium for 0.8500 Å is 0.4328, which is the highest among those of the other atoms in this crystal. The Ca-I ion is coordinated with seven ligand atoms, three oxygen atoms of Glu-186 (Oϵ1, Oϵ2) and Asp-197 (Oδ1), the Nδ1 atom of His-201, the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Ser-194, and two water molecules (Fig. 3a). The coordination geometry is a distorted pentagonal bipyramid, as found in most calcium ions in protein molecules. The Ca-I ion binds to a loop region adjacent to a short 310 helix H7 and is thought to stabilize this region. The Ca-II ion is surrounded by eight ligands: three oxygen atoms of Asp-384 (Oδ1, Oδ2) and Asp-391 (Oδ1); an oxygen atom at the side chain carbonyl of Asn-392; the Oγ atom of Thr-386; two main chain carbonyl atoms of Thr-386 and Pro-388; and a water molecule (Fig. 3b). The Ca-III ion, which is buried deep within the protein molecule, is held by six ligands: three oxygen atoms of Asp-367 (Oδ1), Asp-369 (Oδ1), and Glu-400 (Oϵ2); two main chain carbonyl oxygen atoms of Leu-368 and Asp-394; and a water molecule (Fig. 3c). The geometry around the Ca-III ion is a distorted quadrilateral bipyramidal octahedron. The Ca-II and Ca-III ions are located in the C-terminal domain and are thought to stabilize a loop region (between Asp-384 to Asn-398) in the domain. No calcium ion is found in the loop region around Ser-81, which corresponds to the Ca2+ ion (Ca1) binding loop in subtilisin BPN′ (Fig. 2a). The other Ca2+ ion (Ca2) in the subtilisin BPN′ binding site is also not found in the corresponding site in KP-43. The binding site is filled with the Nζ atom of the side chain of Lys-217 and is covered with an extended loop and the C-domain in KP-43. Two of the three Ca2+ ions in KP-43, Ca-I, and Ca-II are replaced by Sm3+ ions in the samarium derivative, whereas the Ca-III ion is not substituted. The Ca-III ion is thought to bind to the C-terminal domain in KP-43 at the initial stage of folding; it is therefore likely to be buried deep within the molecule. The Ca2+ ion might function as a trigger to initiate the folding of the protein. Substrate Binding Site—The substrate binding site of KP-43 was predicted from the structure of subtilisin BPN′ complexed with the Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (Protein Data Bank ID, 2sic (34Takeuchi Y. Satow Y. Nakamura K.T. Mitsui Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 309-325PubMed Google Scholar)). A disordered 1,4-dioxane molecule was found at the S1 pocket, 2The amino acid residues of the N-terminal and C-terminal sides of the scissile bond are sequentially numbered from the scissile bond as follows: P1, P2, P3,... and P1′, P2′, P3′,..., respectively. The subsites on the protease that complement the substrate binding residues are numbered as follows:... S3, S2, S1, S1′, S2′, S3′,... (35Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4738) Google Scholar). which accommodates the hydrophobic side chain of the P1 residue2 of the substrate or inhibitor in the Nat1 structure. The helix H4 is shorter than the corresponding helices found in the other subtilisins, and its direction is also different from that of the other helices (Figs. 2a and 4). Consequently, the terminal of the substrate binding cleft between H4 and H5 is widening (Fig. 4). The Structure of Oxidized KP-43—The overall structure of H2O2-treated KP-43 is similar to that of native KP-43 (Fig. 5, a and b). Sulfoxides in Met-251 and Met-256, formed by oxidation, were clearly observed in the electron density maps. On the other hand, no other residues, including other methionine residues, were oxidized, as also observed in the electron density maps. The distances between the oxygen atoms of the sulfoxide group of two methionines adjacent to the catalytic serine and the water molecule in the oxyanion hole are 3.6 and 3.2 Å in oxidized KP-43 and oxidized subtilisin BPN′, respectively (Fig. 5, a and b). Assays of Remaining Activity and Substrate Specificity— The remaining activities of the oxidized proteases are shown in Fig. 6. The activities against a synthetic peptide, Glt-Ala-Ala-Pro-Leu-pNA, were rapidly reduced, as expected (Fig. 6a) (7Stauffer C.E. Etson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 5333-5338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Estell D.A. Graycar T.P. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 6518-6521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The decrease in KP-43 activity was relatively slower than that of proteinase K and subtilisin Carlsberg. However, these oxidized proteases were still able to hydrolyze a proteinaceous substrate, urea-denatured hemoglobin, with 70–80% activity after a 120-min oxidation treatment (Fig. 6b). They could also degrade β-casein (data not shown). The digestion patterns of β-casein by the native and oxidized forms of these proteases were investigated with Tricine-SDS-PAGE (Fig. 7). The lengths of β-casein digestion fragments cleaved by these oxidized proteases were similar to those by the native (non-oxidized) enzymes. These results indicate that the native and oxidized proteases cleaved β-casein at the same points. In the case of subtilisin Carlsberg, the native and oxidized enzymes showed approximately the same activity against the polypeptides of molecular weights more than 14,000 (including intact β-casein) (Fig. 7a). On the other hand, the oxidized enzyme showed low activity against the polypeptides of molecular weights less than 14,000 (Fig. 7a). In the case of proteinase K, the oxidized enzyme showed lower activity against the polypeptides in all molecular weight ranges (Fig. 7b). In the case of KP-43, interestingly, the oxidized enzyme showed higher activity against β-casein (Fig. 7c). On the other hand, this oxidized enzyme showed lower activity against digested fragments of β-casein (Fig. 7c). These results indicate that the native and oxidized subtilisins show different substrate specificities that depend on the lengths of substrate peptide chains.Fig. 7Tricine-SDS-PAGE analysis of β-casein digestion by native and oxidized (for 60 min) subtilisin Carlsberg (a), proteinase K (b), and KP-43 (c).

In the case of subtilisin BPN′, a methionine residue, Met-222, adjacent to the catalytic serine residue is oxidized, and the oxidized methionine prevents the intermediate structure of the hydrolyzing reaction, referred to as the tetrahedral intermediate, from forming (7Stauffer C.E. Etson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 5333-5338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Bott R. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A. Graycar T. Katz B. Power S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7895-7906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we determined the crystal structure of the oxidized form of KP-43. Met-256, which is a corresponding residue of Met-222 in subtilisin BPN′, was also oxidized. Although KP-43, proteinase K, and subtilisin Carlsberg lose their ability to hydrolyze synthetic peptides easily by oxidation treatment, all of them retain activity against proteinaceous substrates (Figs. 6 and 7). The digestion patterns of β-casein cleaved by these oxidized proteases are different from those by the non-oxidized enzymes. These results indicate that the oxidation of the methionine (Met-256 in KP-43 protease) is not a fatal modification but rather that it alters substrate specificity. KP-43 loses its ability to hydrolyze peptide substrate more slowly than does proteinase K and subtilisin Carlsberg (Fig. 6). These findings are consistent with previous results by Saeki et al. (10Saeki K. Hitomi J. Okuda M. Hatada Y. Kageyama Y. Takaiwa M. Kubota H. Hagihara H. Kobayashi T. Kawai S. Ito S. Extremophiles. 2002; 6: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The slower rate of decrease in activity suggests that KP-43 is oxidized more slowly than are the other proteases. The distance from the sulfoxide oxygen atom of Met-256oxi in the oxidized form of KP-43 to the water molecule at the oxyanion hole is 3.6 Å, which is 0.4 Å longer than that of the corresponding distance in subtilisin BPN′ (Fig. 5b). In addition, another oxidized methionine, Met-251oxi, was found in the KP-43 structure. The corresponding residue in subtilisin BPN′ is Tyr-217. The slow oxidation of KP-43 might be due to the longer distance between Met-256 and the oxyanion hole and/or may be due to the existence of Met-251.

https://openalex.org/W2034791018,"Transcription of closed circular DNA templates in the presence of DNA gyrase is known to stimulate negative DNA supercoiling both in vivo and in vitro. It has proven elusive, however, to establish a general system in vitro that supports transcription-coupled DNA supercoiling (TCDS) by the “twin-domain” mechanism (Liu, L. F. and Wang, J. C. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 7024–7027) that operates in bacteria. In this report, we examine the properties of TCDS in defined protein systems that minimally contained T7 RNA polymerase and DNA gyrase. Specifically designed plasmid DNA templates permitted us to control the location and length of RNA transcripts. We demonstrate that TCDS takes place by two separate, and apparently independent, mechanistic pathways in vitro. The first supercoiling pathway, which is not likely to be significant in vivo, was found to be dependent on R-loop formation and could be suppressed by the presence of RNase H or bacterial HU protein. The second pathway for TCDS was much more potent, but became predominant in vitro only when sequence-specific DNA-bending proteins were present during transcription, and RNA transcript lengths exceeded 3 kb. This major supercoiling route was shown to be resistant to RNase H and had functional properties consistent with those predicted for the twin-domain mechanism. For example, DNA supercoiling activity was proportional to RNA transcript length and was greatly stimulated by macromolecular crowding agents. Under optimal conditions, the twin domain pathway of TCDS rapidly and efficiently generated superhelicity levels more than twice that typically found in vivo.

Under optimal conditions, the twin domain pathway of TCDS rapidly and efficiently generated superhelicity levels more than twice that typically found in vivo. DNA transactions in prokaryotic cells, such as DNA replication, transcription, and recombination, are often dependent on or stimulated by negative supercoiling of the DNA template (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar, 2Lilley D.M. Chen D. Bowater R.P. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1996; 29: 203-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1992: 521-537Google Scholar). For most of these instances, the available evidence indicates that negative superhelical tension facilitates an early step in the reaction pathway, typically, opening of the DNA double helix. The prokaryotic type II DNA topoisomerase, DNA gyrase, is the enzyme responsible for introducing negative supercoils into bacterial chromosomes and plasmids (4Gellert M. Mizuuchi K. Odea M.H.

While none of the eukaryotic DNA topoisomerases is capable of negatively supercoiling DNA, it is now apparent that some enzymes that translocate processively along DNA, such as RNA polymerase, can affect DNA superhelical tension at a local level (7Pruss G.J. Drlica K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8952-8956Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 8Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bioessays. 1994; 16: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These localized changes in DNA supercoiling can be used to drive or regulate DNA transactions at nearby sites. Liu and Wang (8Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar) proposed an elegant model to explain how transcription by RNA polymerase can be used to stimulate DNA supercoiling. This model, termed the twin supercoil domain model, has received broad experimental support in studies of DNA supercoiling in living cells. The twin-domain model postulates that rotation of the RNA polymerase-RNA complex around the DNA helical axis during transcription becomes increasingly difficult as the size of the growing RNA chain increases. At a critical juncture, it becomes more feasible energetically to rotate the DNA on its axis rather than rotate the transcription complex and any associated proteins around the DNA. Further translocation of the polymerase generates transient DNA supercoils, positive supercoils in front of the polymerase and negative supercoils behind it. In bacteria, DNA gyrase acts to convert a fraction of the transient (+) supercoils to “permanent” (–) supercoils, whereas DNA topoisomerases I and IV function to relax a portion of the transient (–) supercoils (11Zechiedrich E.L.

There is substantial evidence that transient (–) supercoils can be generated on a fraction of plasmid DNA templates as a consequence of transcription in vitro (12Tsao Y.P. Wu H.Y. Liu L.F. Cell. 1989; 56: 111-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 13Droge P. Nordheim A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2941-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Wang Z. Droge P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These studies concluded that the twin domain pathway of TCDS was involved, based on the functional properties of the supercoiling reactions. More recent studies, however, have raised concerns about this conclusion. For example, it has proven difficult to document that transient (+) and transient (–) supercoils are produced simultaneously during transcription as predicted by the twin domain model. Since DNA gyrase, alone among cellular topoisomerases, has the capacity to convert positive superhelical writhe to negative superhelical writhe (6Brown P.O. Cozzarelli N.R. Science. 1979; 206: 1081-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), only T-S systems that contain DNA gyrase should have the capacity to convert transient DNA supercoils arising from the twin-domain mechanism to permanent negative DNA supercoils. However, studies of transcription-induced DNA supercoiling in such systems did not produce convincing evidence for the involvement of a twin-domain mechanism. Instead, Drolet and co-workers (14Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Phoenix P. Raymond M.A. Masse E. Drolet M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 294: 321-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), using minimal T-S systems that contain DNA gyrase as the only topoisomerase, found that an R-loop-dependent pathway may be responsible for most of the observed supercoiling. Recently, we reported that the addition of one or more sequence-specific DNA-bending proteins to a minimal T-S system containing DNA gyrase brought about a dramatic increase in transcription-driven DNA supercoiling (18Leng F. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9139-9144Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the present work, we have characterized the functional properties of TCDS to help pinpoint the mechanism responsible for the stimulatory effects of DNA-bending proteins on transcription-induced DNA supercoiling. We have examined the influence of transcript length, R-loops, sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, and other factors on TCDS in vitro. Our results suggest that DNA supercoiling is produced by two independent routes during transcription of supercoiled DNA templates in the presence of DNA gyrase. Supercoiling occurred primarily via an R-loop-dependent mechanism in a minimal enzyme system that contained just RNA polymerase and DNA gyrase. However, when this T-S system was supplemented with a specific DNA-bending protein, a twin domain type of mechanism became the predominant supercoiling route whenever long RNA transcripts were synthesized. Proteins and Reagents—Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, phage T7 RNA polymerase, E. coli DNA gyrase and HU protein, and the phage λ O replication initiator protein were purified as previously described (18Leng F.

E. coli lac repressor (LacI) and gal repressor (GalR) were kindly provided by S. Adhya (National Institutes of Health). Ribonucleoside triphosphates and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Chloroquine diphosphate, formaldehyde, agarose, polyethylene glycol 8000 (DNase- and RNase-free), and polyvinyl alcohol (30,000–70,000 molecular weight) were obtained from Sigma. All restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, T4 DNA polymerase, and calf intestine alkaline phosphatase were purchased from New England Biolabs. [α-32P]UTP (3000C-i/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The synthetic oligonucleotides FL3 (5′-TCGAGAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGAAGCTTGGATCC-3′) and FL4 (5′-TCGAGGATCCAAGCTTCTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTAATTTC-3′) were purchased from MWG-Biotech, Inc. (High Point, NC). Plasmid DNA Templates—All plasmids were derived from pUC18 (20Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11410) Google Scholar), except pRLM409, which was derived from pUC8. Plasmids pRLM352, pRLM375, pRLM409, and pRLM411 were described previously (18Leng F. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9139-9144Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the plasmid constructions outlined below, ligation of DNA fragments with non-complementary cohesive ends was accomplished following conversion of fragment termini to blunt ends by incubation with T4 DNA polymerase and dNTPs. Plasmid pLUC1 was constructed by the insertion of a 43-bp DNA fragment, containing a T7 promoter (the annealing product of oligonucleotides FL3 and FL4), into the unique XhoI site of pRLM349 (18Leng F. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9139-9144Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Plasmid pLUC3 was constructed by insertion of a 1.87 kb BamHI-HindIII fragment from pRLM4 (21Wold M.S. Mallory J.B. Roberts J.D. LeBowitz J.H. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6176-6180Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that encodes neomycin phosphotransferase II (kanamycin resistance) between the BamHI and HindIII sites of pLUC1. Plasmid pLUC5 was made by insertion of the same 1.87 kb BamHI-HindIII fragment into the unique MscI site of pLUC1. Plasmid pLUC7 was constructed in two steps. Plasmid pLUC3 was digested with restriction enzyme BsaAI to produce 4293 bp and 740 bp DNA fragments. The larger DNA fragment was recircularized by self-ligation to create plasmid pLUC6. Next, the smaller (740 bp) BsaAI fragment from pLUC3 was inserted into the unique MscI site of pLUC6 to generate pLUC7. Plasmid pLUC 9 was also constructed in two steps. Plasmid pLUC8 was generated by removal of a 270-bp KpnI-HindIII DNA fragment (that contained the T7 promoter and oriλ) from pLUC3, followed by recircularization of the vector backbone (4763 bp). Subsequently, the 270-bp KpnI-HindIII fragment from pLUC3 was inserted into the unique AhdI site of pLUC8 to produce pLUC9 and pLUC10, which are identical plasmids except for the orientation of the KpnI-HindIII fragment. Genetic and partial restriction maps of plasmids pRLM352, pRLM375, and the pLUC plasmids are depicted in Fig. 1 and in Fig. S1 (Supplemental Materials). All plasmid chromosomes used as DNA templates in transcription reactions were isolated by an alkaline lysis method (22Norgard M.V. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 113: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and purified further by three successive bandings in CsCl equilibrium gradients in the presence of ethidium bromide. In Vitro Transcription/Supercoiling (T-S) Assay—The standard in vitro T-S assay (300 μl) contained 40 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.6), 11 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm ATP, 0.5 mm each of GTP, CTP, and UTP, 2.5 μg (3.8 nmol as nucleotide) of supercoiled plasmid DNA, E. coli DNA gyrase (80 nm), and either T7 RNA polymerase (20 nm) or E. coli RNA polymerase (33 nm). Where specified, additional proteins were added to the transcription mixtures. All components were mixed on ice and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min or for the indicated amount of time. The reactions were stopped either by addition of EDTA to 25 mm and SDS to 0.1%, followed by a phenol extraction, or by direct extraction with an equal volume of phenol. The DNA/RNA samples were precipitated with two volumes of ethanol and collected by centrifugation. Each precipitate was washed once with 70% ethanol and dissolved in 60 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). Each sample was digested with RNase A (5 μg) and RNase H (50 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C and then extracted once with an equal volume of phenol. The topological state of each DNA preparation was analyzed by electrophoresis in TAE buffer (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning. A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989: 6.7Google Scholar), pH 7.8, in a one-dimensional, 1% agarose gel that contained 5 μg/ml chloroquine. Where indicated, the DNA samples were analyzed by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis, in the presence of 10 μg/ml chloroquine in the first dimension and 50 μg/ml chloroquine in the second dimension. Following electrophoresis, the agarose gels were stained with ethidium bromide, destained, and photographed under 300 nm UV light. Measurements of RNA Synthesis and the Efficiencies of Transcription Termination—Transcription reactions were performed as described above except that each reaction mixture contained [α-32P]UTP (2.5 μCi). Unless specified otherwise, reaction mixtures were incubated for 40 min at 30 °C. RNA synthesis was measured by determining the level of incorporation of labeled nucleotide into acid insoluble material, which was collected on glass fiber filters (Whatman 934-AH) and counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer. For analyses of RNA chain lengths, the reaction mixtures were immediately extracted with an equal volume of phenol following completion of RNA synthesis. RNA transcripts were precipitated with two volume of ethanol and dissolved in 60 μl of RNA gel loading buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 8 mm NaAc, 1 mm EDTA, 50% (v/v) formamide, 6.6% (v/v) formaldehyde, 1% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol). The RNA transcripts were resolved by electrophoresis through 1.3% agarose gels that were prepared in MOPS buffer containing formaldehyde (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 8 mm NaAc, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% formaldehyde). The gels were subsequently dried and visualized by autoradiography or quantitated using a Fuji FLA 3000 image analyzer. The fraction of the total radioactivity (applied to each gel lane) that was present in each labeled RNA band was determined. This information, taken together with the length of the RNA chain in the band, permitted calculation of the number of moles of transcript in each band. The transcription termination efficiency at a given terminator was determined from a comparison of the amount of transcript in the termination band with the total amount of all transcripts comprising longer RNA chains. We recently established a defined protein system, composed of RNA polymerase and DNA gyrase, which permitted us to examine the factors that influence the coupling of DNA supercoiling to transcription (18Leng F. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9139-9144Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In our previous report, we described our discovery that addition of various sequence-specific DNA-bending proteins to the minimal T-S system brought about a dramatic increase in the rate and extent of DNA supercoiling if the DNA template contained one or more recognition sites for the binding protein. The discovery of this simple method for improving the coupling of DNA supercoiling to transcription in vitro prompted us to investigate more comprehensively the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. In this article, we describe studies of the minimal T-S system that are aimed elucidating how transcription stimulates DNA supercoiling, both in the absence of specific DNA-binding proteins and in their presence. Transcription Specificity in the T-S System—The plasmid DNA templates used in the basic T-S system (Fig. 1) typically contain a single promoter for bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase and multiple (5Liu L.F.

With this setup, it should be possible to regulate precisely the regions of individual supercoiled DNA templates that are transcribed, as well as control the lengths of the RNA transcripts that are produced. The specificity of transcription termination is a pertinent issue in the T-S system, considering that phage T7 RNA polymerase must function with E. coli RNA polymerase transcription terminators. Moreover, the T-S system contains DNA gyrase and other proteins that interact with the DNA template and transcription is carried out on negatively supercoiled DNA templates, rather than on the linear DNA templates more commonly used for in vitro studies of transcription. To examine transcription specificity in vitro, we measured the lengths of RNA transcripts produced in a T-S system that contained both DNA gyrase and λ O protein. Our results indicated that transcription was initiated and terminated with very high specificity at the known promoter and transcription terminator DNA elements on each DNA template tested (Fig. S2, Supplemental Material). Additionally, we found that RNA transcripts greatly exceeded 9 kb in length when all of the transcription terminators on the plasmid template were oriented in the inverse (i.e. nonfunctional) direction (Fig. S2, lane 6; Supplemental Material). Our measurements indicate the transcription by T7 RNA polymerase terminated with an efficiency of ∼75–80% at each rho-independent terminator on supercoiled DNA templates in T-S reactions that contained both λ O protein and E. coli HU protein (Table I and Fig. S2, Supplemental Materials). These results are consistent with, or even exceed, measurements of the efficiencies of transcription termination by T7 RNA polymerase at a variety of rho-independent terminators on linear DNA templates in standard transcription reactions (24Jeng S.T. Gardner J.F. Gumport R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3823-3830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Macdonald L.E. Zhou Y. McAllister W.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1030-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab Transcription-coupled DNA Supercoiling in a Minimal T-S System—Having established the specificity of transcription in the T-S system, we proceeded to examine the time course of DNA supercoiling in reaction mixtures that contained simply T7 RNA polymerase and DNA gyrase. We used supercoiled DNA templates that direct synthesis of either short RNA transcripts (pRLM352) or long RNA transcripts (pRLM375). When short RNA transcripts of ∼250 nucleotides in length were being produced, we observed a 5-minute lag where no significant changes in template superhelicity occurred (Fig. 2A, lane 3). By the 20 min time point, however, nearly all of the input template DNA molecules had gained at least 15 or 20 additional negative supercoils (Fig. 2A, lane 5). In contrast, an increase in the superhelicity of a portion of the pRLM375 template was noticeable in as little as 2 min of transcription when long RNA chains are being synthesized (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Despite the more rapid kinetics of supercoiling with pRLM375, however, some template molecules had essentially unchanged superhelicity after 20 min of incubation (Fig. 2B, lane 5). At the same time point, other DNA molecules in the reaction mixture were hypernegatively supercoiled, as indicated by the smear of ethidium fluorescence located below the primary supercoiled band in the chloroquine-agarose gel. This broad heterogeneity in DNA superhelicity, observed specifically when long RNA chains were being synthesized, suggests that a different molecular mechanism may account for some of the increased supercoiling of pRLM375 DNA. Drolet et al. (14Drolet M. Bi X. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2068-2074Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had earlier observed that transcription-stimulated DNA supercoiling in a similar system (composed of E. coli RNA polymerase and DNA gyrase) is sensitive to RNase H. The available evidence suggested that a mechanism dependent on the formation of R-loops was responsible for the increased DNA supercoiling in their system. To determine if R-loops play a significant role in TCDS in our minimal T-S system, we examined the effects of RNase H, RNase A, and E. coli HU protein. RNase H, but not RNase A, is capable of digesting the RNA chain of R-loops. On the other hand, the histonelike HU protein, upon binding to DNA, acts to constrain endogenous DNA supercoiling (26Rouviere-Yaniv J. Yaniv M. Germond J.E. Cell. 1979; 17: 265-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Since increased negative DNA superhelicity increases the stability of R-loops (27Champoux J.J. McConaughy B.L. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 28Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 565-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the lowering of effective DNA superhelicity by the nonspecific binding of HU to the DNA template would be expected to reduce the formation and stability of R-loops. Indeed, our analysis indicates that RNase H and HU each interfere strongly with DNA supercoiling that is coupled to transcription of pRLM352 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the inclusion of RNase A in the T-S system to digest the product RNA chains concurrently during transcription had little to no impact on the amount of DNA supercoiling obtained. These results are consistent with a model in which DNA supercoiling during the synthesis of short RNA chains on pRLM352 is strictly dependent on the formation of R-loops. Qualitatively similar results were obtained when pRLM375, which yields long RNA chains during transcription, was the DNA template (Fig. 3B). In this case, though, the block to DNA supercoiling by RNase H was not as complete (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3). This finding raises the possibility that a twin-domain supercoiling mechanism (8Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7024-7027Crossref PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar) might also be responsible for some portion of the DNA supercoiling when long RNA chains are being produced. To test this idea, we added RNase A to the T-S reaction mixture to prevent the formation of long RNA transcripts during transcription. Rapid digestion of nascent RNA chains would be expected to eliminate DNA supercoiling by the twin domain mechanism. We found, however, that the presence of RNase A had no significant impact on the supercoiling of pRLM375 (Fig. 3B; compare lane 5 with lane 1). We conclude that DNA supercoiling in the minimal T-S system primarily is dependent on the presence of R-loops, irrespective of the length of the RNA transcripts synthesized by T7 RNA polymerase. RNA Synthesis and DNA Supercoiling in the Presence of λ O Protein—We have previously demonstrated that the coupling of DNA supercoiling to transcription in vitro is greatly stimulated by binding to the DNA template of a variety of sequence-specific DNA-binding (and DNA-bending) proteins, such as the λ O replication initiator (18Leng F. McMacken R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9139-9144Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).

However, neuronal Ca2+ stores can be relatively insensitive to increases in the store-mobilizing messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). Using a fluorescent biosensor we have visualized M1 muscarinic acetylcholine (mACh) receptor signaling in individual hippocampal neurons and observed increased IP3 production in the absence of concurrent Ca2+ store release. However, coincident glutamate-mediated synaptic activity elicited enhanced and oscillatory IP3 production that was dependent upon ongoing mACh receptor stimulation and S-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoazolepropionic acid receptor activation of Ca2+ entry. Moreover, the enhanced levels of IP3 now mobilized Ca2+ from intracellular stores that were refractory to the activation of mACh receptors alone. We conclude that convergent ionotropic and metabotropic receptor inputs can facilitate Ca2+ signaling by enhancing IP3 production as well as augmenting release by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release.

There is now substantial evidence that fundamental neuronal properties ranging from membrane excitability through gene expression to regulation of synaptic plasticity can be modulated by changes in intracellular free calcium (Ca2+i) (1Berridge M.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar, 2Rose C.R. Konnerth A.

Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). In particular, it has been increasingly recognized that neuronal intracellular stores, far from just acting as a sink for Ca2+, can play a critical role in modulating the amplitude, localization, propagation, and temporal dynamics of neuronal Ca2+i transients (1Berridge M.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar, 2Rose C.R. Konnerth A.

The key current questions relate to the mechanisms that might control local and global Ca2+ signaling within the highly structured and functional domains of central neurons. A major player in Ca2+ store release is the intracellular messenger IP3 that can be generated by phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of the minor membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) 1The abbreviations used are: PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; mACh, muscarinic acetylcholine; PH, pleckstrin homology; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PLC, phospholipase C; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TTx, tetrodotoxin; NMDA, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid; VDCC, voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel; AMPA, S-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoazolepropionic acid. (4Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). This signaling pathway is particularly prominent in the central nervous system, and a wide range of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can initiate the generation of IP3 in neurons (1Berridge M.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). Currently, models support a role for IP3 receptors in the propagation of Ca2+ waves observed in dendrites following activation of GPCRs such as muscarinic acetylcholine (mACh) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (2Rose C.R. Konnerth A. Neuron. 2001; 31: 519-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 7Nakamura T. Lasser-Ross N. Nakamura K. Ross W.N. J. Physiol.

Moreover, Ca2+ influx via voltage-sensitive or receptor-operated Ca2+ channels can initiate dramatically synergistic Ca2+ release from intracellular stores in hippocampal and cortical pyramidal neurons by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release at IP3 receptors, providing potential ionotropic-metabotropic receptor coincidence detection signaling (7Nakamura T. Lasser-Ross N. Nakamura K. Ross W.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 543: 465-480Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Nakamura T. Nakamura K. Lasser-Ross N. Barbara J.G. Sandler V.M. Ross W.N. J.

Alternatively or additionally, in view of the ability of Ca2+ influx to activate PLC activity in neurons (13Baird J.G. Nahorski S.R. J.

Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 444-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Indeed, the more favorable properties of IP3 rather than Ca2+ as a diffusible messenger (18Albritton N.L. Meyer T. Stryer L. Science. 1992; 258: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar) and the micro regional constraints imposed between the sites of generation and action of IP3 in neurons such as hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (7Nakamura T. Lasser-Ross N. Nakamura K. Ross W.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 543: 465-480Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar) or sympathetic ganglia (19Delmas P. Wanaverbecq N. Abogadie F.C. Mistry M. Brown D.A. Neuron. 2002; 34: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) would support such a model. In the present study we attempt to address these mechanisms by using a genetically expressed fluorescent biosensor for IP3 (the PH-domain of PLC-δ). This probe binds PIP2 with high specificity and affinity (20Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but translocates to the cytoplasm when IP3 accumulates (and PIP2 depletes) (16Okubo Y. Kakizawa S. Hirose K. Iino M.

We have transfected this probe into cultures of rat hippocampal neurons and show a dramatic facilitation of IP3 production, which promotes Ca2+ store release. Synaptic activity within the neuronal network synergizes with mACh receptor activation to elicit enhanced and oscillatory IP3 production. Crucially, this augmentation of IP3 production mobilizes Ca2+ from stores that are refractory to the activation of mACh receptors alone. Hippocampal Cell Culture—Rat hippocampal neurons from 1–3-day-old rat pups were grown in serum-free conditions using previously described methods (10Rae M.G. Martin D.J. Collingridge G.L. Irving A.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8628-8636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Schell M.J. Erneux C. Irvine R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37537-37546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated hippocampi were cut into small pieces of about 2–3 mm3 and trypsinized for 30 min using 0.5 mg ml–1 Pronase E and 0.5 mg ml–1 thermolysin in a HEPES-buffered salt solution (HBSS) containing 130 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5.4 mm KCl, 1mm MgSO4, 25 mm glucose, and 1.8 mm CaCl2 at pH 7.2. Tissue pieces were then triturated in HBSS (Invitrogen) containing 40 μg ml–1 DNase, centrifuged and plated on 25-mm glass coverslips (3 per hippocampi) coated with 50 μg ml–1 poly-d-lysine. Initial growth medium was Neurobasal medium with B27 supplement (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum to which was added 5 μm cytosine arabinoside after 24 h. At 72 h in vitro cells were grown in serum-free Neurobasal, and cultures were maintained for up to 4 weeks with 50% of the medium replaced every 3–4 days. Cultures were transfected at 5 days in vitro (DIV) and used for experimentation 2–3 weeks later. Plasmid Transfection—Neurons were transfected with eGFP-PHPLCδ (0.5 μg) using LipofectAMINE™ 2000 (3 μl per μg of DNA, Invitrogen). Briefly, to cells in Neurobasal media without antibiotics was added 100 μl of the transfection mix prepared in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions and after 3–4 h the medium changed. This avoided the toxicity associated with LipofectAMINE. For experiments involving co-transfection of the truncated DsRed2-IP3 3-kinase a ratio of 2:1 to eGFP-PHPLCδ was used (for details of constructs see Ref. 22Nash M.S. Schell M.J. Atkinson P.J. Johnston N.R. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35947-35960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This produced nearly 100% co-transfection in test experiments using DsRed2 and eGFP (data not shown). Confocal Microscopy—Translocation of eGFP-PHPLCδ was visualized using an Olympus FV500 laser scanning confocal IX70 inverted microscope. Neurons were held at 37 °C using a temperature controller and microincubator (PDMI-2 and TC202A, Burleigh) and were perfused with HEPES buffered saline (HBS) containing 130 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4). Images were captured using an oil immersion ×100 objective and ×4.5 optical zoom. Cellular IP3 levels were indexed as the relative change in fluorescence within a cytoplasmic region of interest as described previously (22Nash M.S. Schell M.J. Atkinson P.J. Johnston N.R.

J. 2001; 356: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Drugs were applied (unless otherwise stated) through the perfusion lines at a rate of approx. 5 ml min–1. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration were determined in cells loaded with Fura4F-AM (1 μm, 1 h) using a Nikon Diaphot inverted epifluorescence microscope with an oil immersion objective (×40) and a Spectramaster II monochromator with a Merlin2000 data acquisition system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were excited at 340 nm and 380 nm, fluorescence emissions were sequentially captured above 500 nm, and data were expressed as the 340:380 nm ratio, which is directly proportional to Ca2+i. Dual IP3 and Ca2+i imaging was performed using the same system on cells transfected with eGFP-PHPLCδ and loaded with Fura-4F. Electrophysiology and Ca2+Imaging—Simultaneous whole-cell current clamp recordings and Ca2+ measurements were made from neurons loaded with Fura4F-AM at 35–37 °C using thick walled glass pipettes (GC150F-7.5, Clark Electromedical, Reading, UK) with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), low-pass filtered at 5 kHz (8-pole Bessel filter), and sampled at 50 kHz. Cells were perfused with HBS and voltages recorded with pClamp 8.2 software (Axon Instruments). The intracellular solution contained 130 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2 and 40 mm sucrose. The pH was adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. Ca2+ dye was excited at 350 and 380 nm with a Polychrome II monochromator (T.I.L.L. Photonics, Martinsried, Germany). Emitted light was separated by a 400-nm dichroic mirror and filtered with a 420-nm long pass emission filter. Fluorescence ratios were acquired every 250 ms with a PentaMAX cooled charge-coupled device camera via a Gen IV image intensifier (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ) and analyzed with MetaFluor software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Data Analysis—Graphs and curve fitting of concentration-dependent data were plotted using Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA), and half-maximal (EC50) values were determined using the non-linear regression analysis available in the software. Data are presented throughout as representative traces and mean ± S.E. from at least three separate neurons and statistical comparisons made using Student's paired or unpaired t test (p < 0.05 was considered significant). The images are presented as either the observed emission intensity (green) or as pseudocolor representations created using software available within the Olympus FV500 system. For quantitative analysis of data presented in Fig. 7, A–C, baseline levels of Ca2+i were taken as the average concentration prior to methacholine challenge in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTx) or nominal [Ca2+]o, or the maximal peak height in the absence of TTx or the presence of Ca2+o and NMDA, respectively. This will slightly underestimate the actual contribution of synergistic IP3 production to Ca2+i changes. For the analyses of the effect of methacholine on picrotoxin-induced Ca2+ oscillations (see Fig. 7D) the mean of peak responses immediately before and after methacholine addition was compared. The data in Fig. 7E were tested using the analysis of co-variance (ANCOVA) package in Prism 3.0. Initiation of IP3 Production by M1 mACh Receptor Activation—IP3 production was visualized in hippocampal neurons using a genetically expressed fluorescent biosensor, GFP-tagged pleckstrin homology domains of phospholipase C-δ1 (GFP-PHPLCδ) (20Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M.

This enriched over the plasma membrane through its interaction with the IP3 head group of PIP2 (Fig. 1A). Activation of mACh receptors with methacholine (100 μm) caused a reversible translocation of the biosensor to the cytoplasm of the soma (Fig. 1B) and dendrites (Fig. 1C) in the presence of 0.5 μm TTx to block synaptic activity. This resulted from increased IP3 levels as opposed to PIP2 depletion because metabolism of IP3 by co-expression with a DsRed2-tagged IP3 3-kinase A, but not the kinase-dead enzyme (22Nash M.S.

Translocation following methacholine addition was also suppressed by co-transfection with a catalytically inactive form of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2, which sequesters activated Gαq/11 subunits (25Willets J.M. Nash M.S. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4157-4162Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that Gq/11 protein-coupled mACh receptors stimulate IP3 production in hippocampal neurons. The pharmacological profile was consistent with the involvement of the M1 mACh receptor-subtype, which is the predominant form in the hippocampus coupled to Gq/11-activated IP3 production (Fig. 2) (25Willets J.M. Nash M.S. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4157-4162Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A shows the IP3 responses to challenges with increasing concentrations of the cholinesterase-resistant mACh receptor agonist carbachol. A clear concentration-dependent increase in cytoplasmic fluorescence was observed indicating that GPCR-stimulated IP3 production is graded in single cells. This finding confirms earlier work showing graded IP3 production in simple cells (26Nash M.S. Young K.W. Willars G.B. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Plotting the peak responses for three different agonists reveals the typical sigmoid shape, with EC50 values that are consistent with the sole involvement of mACh receptors (Fig. 2B). Increases in IP3 were also completely inhibited by the mACh receptor antagonist atropine (Fig. 2C). At a concentration selective for M1 receptors (27Eglen R.M. Watson N. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 78: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), pirenzepine was able to block methacholine-induced IP3 production (Fig. 2C) further implicating the involvement of this subtype. Network Synaptic Activity Augments IP3 Production—The above study was conducted in the presence of TTx, which prevents the synaptic activity that is commonly associated with the networks of “mature” hippocampal cultures (28Bacci A. Verderio C. Pravettoni E. Matteoli M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 29Hardingham G.E. Arnold F.J.L. Bading H. Nat.

Interestingly, in some initial experiments conducted in the absence of TTx spikes in IP3 production above the mACh receptor-stimulated levels were sporadically observed during sustained agonist challenge (Fig. 2D). Phenotypically these changes contrasted markedly with the oscillatory patterns of IP3 production recorded in non-excitable cells (21Hirose K. Kadowaki S. Tanabe M. Takeshima H. Iino M. Science. 1999; 284: 1527-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 22Nash M.S. Schell M.J. Atkinson P.J. Johnston N.R. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A.J. J. Biol.

Nature. 2001; 413: 381-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It seemed unlikely, therefore, that these involved either the dynamic uncoupling mechanism described for metabotropic glutamate-R5a receptor-induced IP3 oscillations (22Nash M.S. Schell M.J.

Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. Nature. 2001; 413: 381-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) or the smaller Ca2+-induced IP3 oscillations observed for α1B-adrenergic receptors (23Young K.W. Nash M.S. Challiss R.A.J. Nahorski S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20753-20760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, because fluctuations in IP3 concentration were only evident in hippocampal cultures challenged with mACh receptor agonist in the absence of TTx a synergy between action potential-induced synaptic activity and Gq/11-coupled GPCR activation was indicated. To test this hypothesis the synaptic activity within the hippocampal cultures was studied. Simultaneous recordings of membrane potential and Ca2+i revealed spontaneous synaptic firing that correlated with bursts of action potentials and concurrent Ca2+i oscillations (Fig. 3A). These occurred synchronously in all hippocampal neurons suggesting the formation of a neural network. The periodic burst firing of action potentials through excitatory transmission among networked hippocampal neurons has been documented previously (28Bacci A. Verderio C. Pravettoni E. Matteoli M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 29Hardingham G.E. Arnold F.J.L. Bading H. Nat.

Trends Neurosci. 1999; 20: 38-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). In cultures showing little or no activity the GABAA antagonist picrotoxin, which reduces the GABAergic inhibitory tone of the network (34Ehlers M.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 231-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), reproducibly induced similar synchronous bursts of action potentials and oscillatory Ca2+ changes (Fig. 3, A and C). These Ca2+ oscillations were inhibited by TTx (Fig. 3B) and occurred simultaneously in all neurons in a field of view (Fig. 3C, inset). The AMPA/kainate antagonist CNQX (20 μm) and removal of extracellular Ca2+ prevented the oscillatory changes in Ca2+i observed in hippocampal neurons, but these were only slightly reduced in amplitude by an NMDA receptor antagonist d-AP5 (50 μm, Fig. 3D). Incubating hippocampal neurons with picrotoxin alone failed to influence IP3 levels, but upon the addition of methacholine (30 μm) large amplitude oscillations in IP3 production were observed (Fig. 4A). Conversely, challenge with methacholine elicited stable IP3 production that was dramatically enhanced after the addition of picrotoxin and inhibited by TTx (Fig. 4B). Importantly, continuous mACh receptor activation was required for the oscillatory enhancements to continue indicating the necessity for GPCR-PLC coupling (Fig. 4A). Although we routinely recorded IP3 in the cell soma the same phenomenon also occurred in the dendrites (Fig. 4, C and D). The synergistic IP3 synthesis was inhibited by treatments that blocked AMPA/kainate receptors and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) but not NMDA receptors (Fig. 5). Fig. 5A shows a representative experiment where methacholine (30 μm)-induced increases in IP3 were potentiated by perfusion with picrotoxin (100 μm). This was inhibited in a transient manner by the co-application of CNQX (20 μm), a selective AMPA/kainate channel antagonist. In contrast, application of the NMDA channel antagonist was without effect (Fig. 5B). Removing extracellular Ca2+ also inhibited the oscillatory potentiation of IP3 production (Fig. 5C). Similarly, application of CdCl2 (100 μm), a non-selective VDCC antagonist, inhibited the synergism between synaptic activity and mACh receptor activation (Fig. 5D). The potentiating action of coincident synaptic activity was clearly shown when concentrations of methacholine that failed to elicit IP3 increases were found to significantly increase upon application of picrotoxin. The continuous activation of mACh receptors was again shown to be important because synergistic IP3 production was lost by perfusion with atropine even in the continued presence of synaptic activity (Fig. 5F).Fig. 5Synergistic IP3 production requires AMPA receptor activation and Ca2+ entry through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels. Supralinear IP3 production was inhibited by the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist CNQX (A and B) but not by the NMDA receptor antagonist d-AP5 (B). Nominally Ca2+-free buffer (C) and a non-selective VDCC inhibitor CdCl2 (D) also prevented synergistic IP3 production. Picrotoxin was able to enhance low level activation of mACh receptors to elicit significant IP3 production (E), and the presence of an active Gq-coupled GPCR was a prerequisite because effects were reversed by atropine (F). Importantly, this indicated that the effect of picrotoxin was caused by enhanced production rather than decreased catabolism.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) These data reveal the strong synergy between activation of the M1 mACh receptor and synaptically driven, AMPA receptor-mediated depolarization and Ca2+ entry through VDCCs. Recent studies by Okubo et al. (16Okubo Y. Kakizawa S. Hirose K. Iino M. Neuron. 2001; 32: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) in cerebellar Purkinje cells using an identical biosensor revealed that Ca2+ influx following activation of AMPA receptors could stimulate IP3 production. These authors suggested the involvement of the Ca2+-activated PLC-δ family. In contrast, in the present study it should be emphasized that for hippocampal neurons Gαq/11-activated PLC isoforms (most likely PLC-β1 and/or PLC-β4) are an absolute prerequisite for the enhancement of IP3 production. A Post-synaptic Ca2+-dependent Augmentation of IP3 Production—Repetitive AMPA application (10 μm for 1 s) mimicked the augmentation of mACh receptor-induced IP3 production in neurons by synaptic activity (Fig. 6A) and potentiated methacholine-stimulated responses by 500% (methacholine response ± 10 μm AMPA, n = 8, p < 0.005). This strongly implies that the interaction is at a post-synaptic level rather than a modulation of glutamate release following changes in network excitability. We also determined whether the enhancement of mACh receptor-induced IP3 production was specific to AMPA receptors or the result of elevated Ca2+i. Although NMDA channels play little or no role in the synaptic activity-mediated potentiation of IP3 production, application of NMDA increased Ca2+ levels in the hippocampal neurons. Challenging neurons with NMDA alone had little effect on IP3 production; however, co-application with methacholine potentiated IP3 production (Fig. 6B; mean amplification 1000%, n = 14, p < 0.001). In combination the data suggest that synaptic activity in hippocampal cultures elicited glutamate release to activate AMPA receptors, which depolarized neurons to activate VDCCs. This resulted in an increase in Ca2+i that synergized with mACh receptor activation to lead to synergistic IP3 production. Because action potential-induced synaptic activity occurs as bursts in hippocampal neuronal cultures this resulted in oscillatory IP3 increases. The ability of NMDA to mimic the action of AMPA indicated that it is the increase in Ca2+i that mediated the potentiated responses. Enhanced IP3 Production Is Accompanied by Mobilization of Ca2+ Stores—Next we ascertained the functional significance of the enhanced IP3 production on Ca2+i store release. When neurons presenting pre-existing network activity, manifest as synchronous repetitive Ca2+ spikes, were perfused with TTx, activity ceased and the Ca2+i declined to a lower basal level (Fig. 7A). When these cells were challenged with methacholine (30 μm) for 30 s in the continued presence of TTx, increases in Ca2+i were rarely observed (Fig. 7A, 9 of 101 cells). However, upon TTx removal network activity restarted and methacholine routinely elicited Ca2+ increases (Fig. 7A, 90 of 101 cells). The peak Ca2+ responses above the background levels were significantly greater (0.112 ± 0.008 ratio units) during neural network activity than in its absence (0.019 ± 0.002). Perfusion with nominally Ca2+-free buffer, which similarly prevented network activity (Fig. 7B), also inhibited methacholine-elicited Ca2+ increases (10 of 73 versus 70 of 73 cells in the presence of Ca2+o). Peak responses to methacholine (100 μm) were 10-fold greater in the presence of Ca2+o (0.222 ± 0.016 ratio units) compared with responses in the absence of Ca2+o (0.022 ± 0.003). The synergism did not result from network activity per se because perfusion with NMDA in the presence of TTx raised Ca2+i levels and facilitated methacholine-induced Ca2+ release (Fig. 7C). Peak methacholine responses were 0.138 ± 0.007 and 0.048 ± 0.004 (mean ± S.E., n = 93, p < 0.001) in the presence and absence of NMDA, respectively. The enhanced Ca2+ responses were a consequence of Ca2+-store mobilization, because they did not occur following pre-incubation with the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid to deplete the intracellular Ca2+-stores (Fig. 7A, inset). Methacholine (30 μm) also significantly increased (10.7 ± 0.5%, n = 169, p < 0.001) the amount of Ca2+i observed during picrotoxin-induced network oscillations (Fig. 7D). Plotting the peak increase observed in the presence of methacholine against that in its absence revealed a linear relationship that was offset but parallel to the line of equality (Fig. 7E, p > 0.05 for comparison of slope, and p < 0.001 for y axis intercept point compared with line of equality). This suggests that under these conditions the synergism between mACh receptor activation and synaptic activity reaches a threshold required to release Ca2+ from the stores irrespective of the background Ca2+i. Dual IP3 and Ca2+ imaging experiments revealed that initiating network activity with picrotoxin and subsequent perfusion with methacholine resulted in oscillatory spikes of IP3 underlying the enhanced Ca2+ spikes (Fig. 7D). Importantly, synergistic IP3 production was required, because without methacholine (but in the continued presence of increased cellular IP3 levels) the enhancement was no longer observed (Fig. 7D). Methacholine also enhanced AMPA-mediated increases in Ca2+i (Fig. 7F). Rapid application of AMPA (100 ms) elicited reproducible peaks in Ca2+i that were significantly increased (47 ± 4%, mean ± S.E., 96 cells, p < 0.001) during periods of perfusion with methacholine (30 μm). In many studies activation of Gq/11-coupled GPCRs alone failed to initiate release from Ca2+ stores in neurons (7Nakamura T. Lasser-Ross N. Nakamura K. Ross W.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 543: 465-480Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 9Nakamura T. Nakamura K. Lasser-Ross N. Barbara J.G. Sandler V.M. Ross W.N. J.

Neuron. 2002; 34: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Although the relative insensitivity of neuronal IP3 receptors (35Khodakhah K. Ogden D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4976-4980Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) or Ca2+ store filling (10Rae M.G. Martin D.J. Collingridge G.L. Irving A.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8628-8636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Stutzmann G.E. LaFerla F.M. Parker I. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 758-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) may contribute, it has recently been demonstrated that the proximity of the components of the PLC signaling pathways could be crucial to Ca2+ release. In studies on sympathetic neurons (19Delmas P. Wanaverbecq N. Abogadie F.C. Mistry M. Brown D.A. Neuron. 2002; 34: 209-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 36Delmas P. Crest M. Brown D.A. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), GPCR-mediated elevations in IP3 only promoted release of Ca2+ from stores when they occur rapidly and close to the IP3 receptors. When levels increased relatively slowly, such as by diffusion from distant sites of synthesis, no Ca2+ release occurred because of a rapid feedback inhibition of the IP3 receptors by Ca2+/calmodulin. In the excitatory neurons of the hippocampus IP3 receptors, in contrast to ryanodine receptors, appear to be located extra-synaptically on the dendritic shafts (2Rose C.R. Konnerth A. Neuron. 2001; 31: 519-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Thus, any IP3 generated at synapses on spines must diffuse from its site of production to its site of action. In addition, the IP3 3-kinase “firewall” juxtaposed to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane limits the diffusional capacity of IP3 in hippocampal neurons (24Schell M.J. Erneux C. Irvine R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37537-37546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the facilitated IP3 synthesis that we have identified in this study might be expected to have a major contribution to these characteristics of neuronal Ca2+ store release. A rapid amplification of IP3 production could provide a means to achieve the requisite rapid accumulation to open the IP3 receptors. Furthermore, the amplification of IP3 production could significantly enhance the ability of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release to activate more of the cellular population of IP3 receptors. Although it is well established that the activation of IP3 receptors is under the control of both IP3 and Ca2+ (4Berridge M.J. Bootman M.D. Roderick H.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 517-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar) the sequence of binding of these ligands is crucial. Initial binding of IP3 reveals the stimulatory Ca2+ site facilitating more Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, whereas initial Ca2+ binding inhibits the IP3 receptor (37Adkins C.E. Taylor C.W. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1115-1118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that although Ca2+ stores in hippocampal neurons are largely refractory to mACh receptor activation alone, coincident synaptic activity and synergistic IP3 production facilitate Ca2+ release. The synergy is dependent upon both Ca2+ entry and Gαq/11 activation and could provide both positive feedback and potential coincidence detection. This appears to differ from the situation in cerebellar Purkinje cells in which AMPA receptor-stimulated, voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx results in enhanced IP3 production (16Okubo Y. Kakizawa S. Hirose K. Iino M. Neuron. 2001; 32: 113-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), although it is difficult to eliminate a constitutive GPCR activation in those studies. Our own data would suggest that at least initially, a Gαq/11-activated PLC-β is involved in this response, but whether there is recruitment of a separate Ca2+-dependent form of PLC, such as PLC-δ, remains to be established. A recent study has revealed that Ca2+ entry-dependent PLC-γ2 translocation and activation plays a key role in the amplification of IP3 production in B lymphocytes (38Nishida M. Sugimoto K. Hara Y. Mori E. Morii T. Kurosaki T. Mori Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4677-4688Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because this enzyme is expressed in neuronal cells (39Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.N. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 80: 1291-1335Crossref Scopus (831) Google Scholar), it represents a further potential target for feed-forward activation in hippocampal neurons. Overall, the current results strongly support a model in which dramatically enhanced, Ca2+-dependent IP3 production either activates a relatively insensitive IP3 receptor, or in which IP3 itself acts as a mobile messenger to overcome spatial or catabolic barriers between the mACh receptor-Gαq/11-PLC complex and appropriate IP3 receptors. Within neuronal spines this synergism could potentially allow IP3 to mobilize Ca2+ from stores at dendritic junctions and would be consistent with observations (7Nakamura T. Lasser-Ross N. Nakamura K. Ross W.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 543: 465-480Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 8Larkum M.E. Watanabe S. Nakamura T. Lasser-Ross N. Ross W.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 549: 471-488Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar) in which activation of synaptic ionotropic and metabotropic receptor signaling pathways leads to a focal rise in dendritic Ca2+ concentration that may be propagated to the soma invading the nucleus (40Power J.M.

The stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38γ has been implicated in the G2 phase checkpoint induced by IR. We recently discovered MRK as a member of the MAPK kinase kinase family that activates p38γ. Here we investigated the role of MRK in the checkpoint response to IR. We identified autophosphorylation sites on MRK that are important for its kinase activity. A phosphospecific antibody that recognizes these sites showed that MRK is activated upon IR in a rapid and sustained manner. MRK depletion by RNA interference resulted in defective S and G2 checkpoints induced by IR that were accompanied by reduced Chk2 phosphorylation and delayed Cdc25A degradation. We also showed that Chk2 is a substrate for MRK in vitro and is phosphorylated at Thr68 by active MRK in cells. MRK depletion also increased sensitivity to the killing effects of IR. In addition, MRK depletion reduced IR-induced activation of p38γ but had no effect on p38α activation, indicating that MRK is a specific activator of p38γ after IR. Inhibition of p38γ by RNA interference, however, did not impair IR-induced checkpoints. Thus, in response to IR MRK controls two independent pathways: the Chk2-Cdc25A pathway leading to cell cycle arrest and the p38γ MAPK pathway.

DNA damage induces a complex cellular response that involves interacting networks controlling cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis (1Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2596) Google Scholar). Defects in any of these functions may contribute to chromosome instability and predisposition to cancer. DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest is thought to be important to allow time for DNA repair. This process is controlled by signaling events collectively referred to as checkpoints (1Zhou B.B.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are signal transduction cascades composed of three sequential kinases: MAPKKK, MAPK kinase, and MAPK. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 MAPK pathways respond to cellular stress including DNA damage. In addition to participating in the apoptotic response that follows extensive DNA damage, the p38 pathway has been reported to be required for checkpoint regulation. In particular, p38α and p38β have been implicated in the UV radiation checkpoint response (29Bulavin D.V. Higashimoto Y. Popoff I.J. Gaarde W.A. Basrur V. Potapova O. Appella E. Fornace A.J.J.

Downey J.S. Fearns C. Wang Y. Huang S. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4543-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The pathway that leads to p38γ activation by IR is, however, not clear. MRK is a MAPKKK protein that belongs to the mixed lineage kinase (MLK) protein family (31Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). We have characterized the most abundant of the two MRK splice forms, MRK-β (32Gross E.A. Callow M.G. Waldbaum L. Thomas S. Ruggieri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and throughout this study we refer to this form simply as MRK. Overexpression of MRK activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 pathways (32Gross E.A. Callow M.G. Waldbaum L. Thomas S. Ruggieri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We showed that ectopic expression of MRK results in an increase in the G2 phase cell population and that a dominant negative MRK mutant reduced cell cycle arrest caused by IR in MDCK cells, which suggested a role for MRK in checkpoint regulation (32Gross E.A. Callow M.G. Waldbaum L. Thomas S. Ruggieri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this study, using RNA interference, we address the role of endogenous MRK in the response to IR and demonstrate that MRK contributes to cell cycle arrest induced by IR, signaling directly upstream of Chk2 and Cdc25A. Although MRK is required for IR-induced p38γ activation, its control of checkpoint regulation is independent of p38γ. Therefore, in response to IR, MRK activates two independent pathways: the Chk2-Cdc25A pathway and the stress-activated p38γ MAPK pathway. Plasmids, Cell Transfections, and in Vitro Kinase Assays—The MRK mutants carrying alanine substitutions for threonine at positions 161, 162, and 165 and the double mutant MRK-T161A/S165A were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit from Stratagene. The following primers were used to convert the respective threonine to alanine: T161A, 5′-CTCTCGGTTCCATAACCATGCCACACACATGTCCTTGGTTG-3′; T162A, 5′-CGGTTCCATAACCATACAGCCCACATGTCCTTGGTTGGA-3′; S165A, 5′-AACCATACAACACACATGGCCTTGGTTGGAACTTTCCCA-3′; and T161A/S165A, 5′-CGGTTCCATAACCATGCCACACACATGGCCTTGGTTGGAACTTTC-3′. Mutagenesis was conducted as suggested by the manufacturer. The resulting genes were subcloned into pCAN plasmid (essentially pcDNA3, Invitrogen) under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The catalytically inactive MRK-K45A plasmid has been previously described (32Gross E.A. Callow M.G. Waldbaum L. Thomas S. Ruggieri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCEFL-HA ERK6/p38γ was obtained from Silvio Gutkind (National Institutes of Health). The active MRK construct was generated by subcloning a XbaI fragment containing wild type MRK into the XbaI site of a derivative of pC4-Fv1E, pC4-Fv2E, a plasmid that is part of the ARGENT-regulated homodimerization kit (ARIAD; www.ariad.com/regulationkits). The resulting MRK construct was found to be constitutively active even in the absence of the dimerizing drug. HEK293 and U2-OS cells were transfected using the Effectene reagent (Qiagen) and the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), respectively, according to the manufacturers' suggestions. In vitro kinase assays were performed as previously described (32Gross E.A. Callow M.G. Waldbaum L. Thomas S. Ruggieri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Cell Lines, Cell Culture, and siRNA Treatment—Human U2-OS, HCT116, and HEK293 cells were obtained from ATCC. The U2-OS and HCT116 cells were grown in McCoy's media (Invitrogen), and the HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Bio Whittaker); all media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone), glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. The control GM0637I cells and the AT cell lines GM09607B and GM0849D were purchased from the Coriell Cell Repository and grown in minimum essential medium Eagle-Earle basal salts solution with 2× concentration of essential and nonessential amino acids and vitamins, 15% fetal calf serum, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. siRNA transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) essentially following the manufacturer's recommendations, with 4 μl/ml/well of lipid reagent in a six-well plate. All of the siRNA duplexes used in this study were designed following the rules suggested by Elbashir et al. (33Elbashir S.M. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2659) Google Scholar). A BLAST search was conducted against GenBank™ to ensure that their sequence did not cross-hybridize to nonspecific targets. In addition, these duplexes were used at the lowest concentration that gave at least 80% target inhibition. In some experiments the concentration was 150 nm, but subsequently it was reduced to 20 nm, with similar results. Maximal inhibition of MRK expression was observed 2 days after transfection, and the effect was sustained up to 5 days after transfection (data not shown). All of the siRNA duplexes were supplied by Dharmacon Research. Specific oligonucleotide sequences for each target gene were as follows: 5′-GAAUGUCUGAGGAGUCUUAdTdT-3′ (M1), 5′-CUUGUUUAUCUCAGUCUGUdTdT-3′ (M3-1), and 5′-ACAUGCAAGCCAAGCAGAAdTdt-3′ (M13) targeting MRK; 5′-UGGAAGCGUGUUACUUACAdTdT-3′ (29Bulavin D.V. Higashimoto Y. Popoff I.J. Gaarde W.A. Basrur V. Potapova O. Appella E. Fornace A.J.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 102-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar), and 5′-GGCAUCCAUCAGAGCAGACdTdT-3′ (33Elbashir S.M. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2659) Google Scholar) targeting p38γ; 5′-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGAdTdT-3′ luciferase as control, and 5′-GAAUACAUUCCCUACCUCAdTdT-3′ targeting CDC25A. Radio-resistant DNA Synthesis—Forty-four hours after siRNA transfection, U2-OS cells were labeled for 18 h with 10 nCi/ml of [14C]thymidine, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with regular media for 24 h. The cells were irradiated at different doses using a 137Cs source, incubated for 30 min, and labeled with [3H]thymidine (2.5 nCi/ml) for 15 min. The cells were then harvested and fixed in 70% methanol for 1 h, transferred to Whatman filters, and sequentially fixed with 70 and 95% methanol. The filters were air-dried, and the amount of radioactivity was assayed in a liquid scintillation counter. The resulting ratio of 3H to 14C cpm, corrected for the counts that resulted from channel cross-over, were the measure of DNA synthesis. G2/M Checkpoint Analysis—Forty-four hours after transfection with the siRNA duplexes, U2-OS cells were exposed to 6 Gy of γ-radiation, incubated for 1 h, harvested using phosphate-buffered saline with 10% fetal calf serum, centrifuged, and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline with 1% fetal calf serum. The pellet was resuspended in 500 μlof phosphate-buffered saline, fixed by the stepwise addition of 10 volumes of ice-cold 95% ethanol at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells were then stained with propidium iodide and anti-phospho-histone H3 as described in Xu et al. (34Xu B. Kim S. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3445-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) and analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter. Cycloheximide Treatment, Protein Analysis, and Antibodies—Forty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with cyclohexamide (25 μg/ml) (Sigma), immediately exposed to 6 Gy of IR, and harvested at the indicated times. For protein analysis, the cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors tablets (1 tablet/7 ml) (Roche Applied Science), 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10% Nonidet P-40, and 0.4 unit/ml Benzonase (Novagen). The different proteins were detected by Western blot analysis with the following specific antibodies: the 4-23 monoclonal anti-MRK (32Gross E.A. Callow M.G. Waldbaum L. Thomas S. Ruggieri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar); the phospho-specific anti-MRK antibody, which was generated against a peptide phosphorylated at positions Thr161 and Ser165; the anti-phospho-Chk2 (Thr68) antibody (Cell Signaling); the anti-Cdc25A antibody (Ab-3; NeoMarkers); the anti-p38γ antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.); the anti-phospho-p38α antibody (Cell Signaling); and the anti-tubulin antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Ionizing Radiation Induces MRK Autophosphorylation and Activation—As a first approach to study the role of endogenous MRK in the DNA damage response, we generated a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes active MRK. Within the MRK kinase loop between the DFG (subdomain VII) and APE (subdomain VIII) residues, there are three conserved threonine/serine residues (Thr161, Thr162, and Ser165) (Fig. 1A) that in other MLK family proteins are important for activation (31Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 35Leung I.W. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1961-1967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To test the role of these residues in MRK activation, we mutated them to alanine, and upon expression in COS cells, we tested the mutant proteins for their activity in vitro. Fig. 1B shows that alanine substitution at positions 161, 165, and, to a lesser extent 162, results in loss of MRK autophosphorylation as well as loss of phosphorylation of a substrate (MBP) in vitro. To confirm that these residues are autophosphorylation sites, we constructed GST fusions with peptides containing the wild type MRK kinase loop (GST-KL-WT) or its double alanine mutant counterpart (GST-KL-AA). We used these proteins as substrates in an in vitro kinase reaction with baculovirus-expressed wild type MRK, which has constitutive kinase activity. Fig. 1C shows that the GST-KL-WT protein is indeed phosphorylated by active MRK. These data demonstrate that these residues are phosphorylated by MRK and that autophosphorylation at these sites is required for MRK activity in vitro. The MRK-T161AS165A double mutant did not appear to have lower activity than each single mutant. However, to increase specificity, we used a peptide that is phosphorylated at both sites to raise an antibody that detects active MRK. To characterize this antibody, we expressed wild type or mutant MRK proteins in human embryonic HEK293 cells and induced MRK activation by osmotic shock. Fig. 1D shows reactivity of the phospho-specific anti-MRK antibody with activated wild type MRK but not with mutant MRK-T161AS165A (M-AA). In agreement with our published in vitro data (32Gross E.A. Callow M.G. Waldbaum L. Thomas S. Ruggieri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), loss of MRK enzymatic activity, caused by alanine substitution for lysine in the active site of the MRK-K45A mutant (M-KA), also abolished phosphorylation at positions 161/165. These observations demonstrate that phosphorylation of the MRK kinase loop is the result of autophosphorylation in cells. Using this reagent, we examined activation of endogenous MRK by IR in the human osteosarcoma U2-OS cells. We found that MRK is phosphorylated at these sites within 30 min after IR and that this signal persists for up to 12 h (Fig. 2A, top two panels). The phosphorylation signal is specific for MRK because it is lost in cells treated with a specific MRK siRNA (Fig. 2A, bottom panel), which is described in the following paragraph. These results indicate that MRK undergoes rapid autophosphorylation upon exposure to IR. Previously, we demonstrated p38γ activation by MRK (32Gross E.A. Callow M.G. Waldbaum L. Thomas S. Ruggieri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To confirm that IR-induced phosphorylation of MRK leads to MRK activation in cells, we measured activation of p38γ in cells co-transfected with wild type or mutant MRK and p38γ. After IR treatment, immunoprecipitated p38γ was tested for kinase activity in vitro using ATF-2 as substrate. Fig. 2B shows that upon exposure to 6 Gy of IR, there was a 15-fold increase in p38γ activity in cells expressing ectopic MRK, compared with a 2-fold activation in control cells (vector). Consistent with data shown in Fig. 1B, the double alanine kinase loop mutant (M-AA) was significantly impaired in stimulating p38γ activity compared with wild type MRK. Therefore, we conclude that IR induces MRK autophosphorylation and activation in vivo. MRK Depletion Causes Radio-resistant DNA Synthesis and Progression through Mitosis upon IR—To test the functional involvement of MRK in IR-induced cell cycle arrest, we down-regulated the expression of endogenous MRK in cells using RNA interference. A siRNA duplex M1, directed against MRK, efficiently depleted cells of endogenous MRK (Fig. 3A). Reduction of MRK expression did not change the growth properties of the cells during the time frame of the experiments performed in this study. To examine the role of MRK in S phase checkpoint regulation, we measured DNA synthesis in control and MRK siRNA-treated cells after IR. [3H]Thymidine incorporation into DNA was monitored after exposure of siRNA-transfected cells to various doses of IR (Fig. 3B). A decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation into newly synthesized DNA in control cells indicated that these cells had an intact S phase checkpoint. In contrast, MRK-depleted cells continued to initiate DNA replication at all doses of IR as indicated by radio-resistant DNA synthesis. Thus, MRK is required for the S phase arrest induced by IR. We monitored G2 arrest by measuring the number of cells that entered into mitosis after IR. The cells were co-stained with propidium iodide to determine DNA content and with anti-phospho-histone H3 antibody to identify mitotic cells (34Xu B. Kim S. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3445-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). MRK-depleted cells had three times as many mitotic cells 1 h after IR compared with control cells (Fig. 3C). Reduction in G2 phase arrest by MRK siRNA was also observed in the human colorectal carcinoma HCT116 cells; after exposure to 6 Gy of IR, the fraction of mitotic cells in MRK-depleted cells was twice as large as that in control cells (0.8% versus 0.4%; data not shown). Although the impairment of G2 arrest is not as robust as that observed in S phase, collectively, these data indicate that MRK contributes to IR-induced cell cycle arrest in both S and G2. MRK Expression Is Dependent on ATM—ATM is rapidly activated by IR and is one of the most upstream checkpoint signaling elements in the DNA damage response. To address the dependence of MRK activation on ATM, we tested the AT cell lines GM09607B and GM05849D and the control cells GM0637I for the MRK response to IR. In the course of these experiments, we found that MRK levels in the AT cells were reduced by at least 10-fold compared with control cells (Fig. 4). Although the low levels of MRK in the AT cells made it impossible to test the phosphorylation state of MRK after IR in these cells, our data indicate that expression of MRK is dependent on the expression of ATM. MRK Inhibition Reduces IR-induced Chk2 Activation and Cdc25A Degradation—To begin dissecting the biochemical pathway controlled by MRK in checkpoint regulation, we determined the level of Chk2-Thr68 phosphorylation. ATM phosphorylates this site in response to IR, a step that is necessary for Chk2 activation (36Ahn J.Y. Schwarz J.K. Piwnica-Worms H. Canman C.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5934-5936PubMed Google Scholar, 37Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10342-10348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Fig. 5A shows that 1 h after IR, Chk2 was phosphorylated at Thr68 in control cells. In contrast, MRK-depleted cells showed a marked and significant decrease in Chk2 phosphorylation, as determined by quantification of the Thr68 phosphorylation levels in the respective samples (Fig. 5A, histograms). To confirm this observation, we generated two additional siRNA duplexes directed at MRK, M13 and M3-1. Individually, these siRNAs were less efficient than M1 in depleting endogenous MRK (data not shown), but when used together they achieved significant MRK inhibition comparable with that obtained with M1. This reduction in MRK levels also resulted in a decreased Chk2-Thr(P)68 signal (Fig. 5A, right panel), demonstrating that the silencing effect is specific. Analysis of total Chk2 levels (Fig. 5B) indicated that inhibition of MRK expression does not alter Chk2 expression. Thus, the lower levels of the Chk2-Thr(P)68 signal in MRK siRNA-treated cells reflect reduced Chk2 activity. One of the Chk2 substrates that participate in checkpoint regulation is the Cdc25A phosphatase, which upon phosphorylation by Chk2 is degraded. Consistent with reduced Chk2 phosphorylation, we observed that Cdc25A degradation was delayed in MRK-deficient cells (Fig. 6). These data indicate that MRK operates upstream of Chk2 and Cdc25A in checkpoint regulation. MRK Is Essential for IR-induced Activation of p38γ, but Its Role in S and G2 Cell Cycle Checkpoints Is Independent of p38γ—Using dominant negative mutants of p38γ and its activator MKK6, Wang et al. (30Wang X. McGowan C.H. Zhao M. He L. Downey J.S. Fearns C. Wang Y. Huang S. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4543-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) reported that p38γ is required for G2 arrest induced by IR and that it operates upstream of Chk2. We previously showed that overexpression of MRK in MDCK cells activates p38γ (32Gross E.A. Callow M.G. Waldbaum L. Thomas S. Ruggieri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13873-13882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and Fig. 2 shows that exposure to IR enhances p38γ activation in U2-OS cells expressing ectopic MRK. We therefore tested whether MRK mediates IR-induced checkpoint regulation via p38γ. We first measured p38γ activation by IR in cells depleted of MRK. After exposure to IR, p38γ was immunoprecipitated from cells transfected with control or MRK siRNA, and its activity was measured in vitro against ATF2 as substrate. Fig. 7A shows that the 2-fold activation of p38γ induced by IR was almost completely abolished in MRK-depleted cells. These data demonstrate that MRK is necessary for p38γ activation after IR. In contrast, reduced MRK expression did not decrease p38α activation in response to IR (Fig. 7B). Thus, MRK specifically activates p38γ upon IR. We then tested whether p38γ mediates the effects of MRK on the S phase checkpoint, using two different p38γ siRNAs. A"

Strand transfer has been linked to “pausing” occurring at secondary structures during synthesis by reverse transcriptase. Yet, weakly structured templates lacking strong pause sites also undergo efficient transfer. In this report, transfer crossover sites on high and low structured templates from the gag-pol frameshift region (GagPol) and the env (Env) regions, respectively, were determined by using a reconstituted in vitro strand transfer assay. The assay tested transfers occurring between a donor and acceptor template over a 150-nucleotide homologous region. The majority of crossovers were in a small 23-nucleotide region near a major pause site on GagPol, clearly indicating a pause-driven mechanism. In contrast, on Env, transfers were more dispersed clustering toward the end of the homologous region. Slowing down polymerization on Env by decreasing the dNTP concentration resulted in crossovers shifting toward the beginning of the homologous region. Removal of a small 38-nucleotide region at the 3′-end of the Env acceptor had a large effect on the level of strand transfer despite very few crossovers mapping to this region. This implicated this part of the acceptor in transfers occurring at downstream positions. For Env the results support a mechanism where the acceptor rapidly binds nascent DNA, then “zippers” downstream catching up with the donor-DNA hybrid and displacing the donor.

More recently results suggesting ∼10 recombinations per infectious cycle in T cell lines and as many as 30 per cycle in macrophages have been reported (3Rhodes T. Wargo H. Hu W.S. J.

Most retroviral recombination occurs during synthesis of minus strand DNA using genomic RNA as template by a process called strand transfer (also referred to as strand jumping or template switching) (7Hu W.S.

Strand transfer involves the switching of DNA being synthesized on one template (referred to as “donor”) to homologous regions on the same or on a second template (referred to as “acceptor”) where the synthesis continues. The resultant proviral DNA is capable of encoding a genomic RNA that is a chimera of the original parent templates. The first and second strand transfers (strong stop DNA transfers) that occur during reverse transcription are obligatory transfers without which the viral replication cannot proceed to completion. In addition to these vital events, the virus can also undergo internal strand transfers, which can potentially occur at any position along the genome (1Zhuang J. Jetzt A.E. Sun G. Yu H. Klarmann G.

They also may increase the probability of successful DNA synthesis by providing a salvage pathway for broken or damaged genomes (17Coffin J.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1979; 42: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Internal transfers can occur during plus strand DNA synthesis, albeit to a lesser extent than during minus strand DNA synthesis (7Hu W.S. Temin H.M. Science. 1990; 250: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 18Yu Q. Ottmann M. Pechoux C. Le Grice S. Darlix J.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7676-7680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of pausing by reverse transcriptase (RT) during these events has been studied extensively by several investigators (19Harrison G.P. Mayo M.S. Hunter E. Lever A.M.

Virol. 1992; 66: 6370-6378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pause sites are positions on the template where the rate of DNA synthesis temporarily slows resulting in a build up of products at that point. Pausing generally results from secondary structures that impede RT or specific sequences like runs of adenosine on DNA templates (23Suo Z. Johnson K.A.

The pause-driven transfer mechanism proposes that the paused DNA products are the substrates that ultimately are used to produce transfer products, or that pausing sets the stage for transfer events that occur immediately downstream of the pause site (20Roda R.H. Balakrishnan M. Kim J.K. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46900-46911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21DeStefano J.J. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism involves a complex interplay of nucleic acids, nucleocapsid protein (NC), and RT. Previous reports have shown that the polymerase and the RNase H activities of RT are not strictly coupled, and the rate of polymerization is generally much faster than RNase H (29DeStefano J.J. Buiser R.G. Mallaber L.M. Myers T.W. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7423-7431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This means that during uninterrupted polymerase activity, the RNA template may not be extensively degraded. This situation changes at a pause site; here the RNase H activity takes precedence over synthesis (23Suo Z. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12468-12476Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Degradation of the RNA template destabilizes the donor RNA template-nascent DNA interactions and also clears regions on the DNA that are free to bind to the acceptor template. Transfer can occur after the DNA dissociates from the donor or by active invasion of the donor-DNA complex by the acceptor template (acceptor-facilitated transfer) (20Roda R.H. Balakrishnan M. Kim J.K. Roques B.P. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46900-46911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 21DeStefano J.J. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During invasion, there is a transient trimeric structure with the 3′-terminal region of the DNA bound to the donor and more upstream regions bound to the acceptor template. In vitro (31Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Science. 1992; 258: 1112-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) and ex vivo (32Delviks K.A. Pathak V.K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 7923-7932Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) studies have shown evidence supporting the existence of a trimeric structure during strand transfer. There is in vitro evidence for the occurrence of the first mechanism also (21DeStefano J.J. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); hence, it is not yet known if minus strand DNA transfers occur preferentially through one of the two above mentioned mechanisms. The manifold effect of NC on pause-mediated transfers has been well studied (33DeStefano J.J. Arch. Virol. 1995; 140: 1775-1789Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Guo J. Henderson L.E.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31536-31546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The main components of the NC nucleic acid chaperone activity are annealing and melting of nucleic acids. At pause sites, NC would be expected to melt out the obstructing secondary structures to facilitate continued synthesis on the donor template. Strand transfer experiments on a secondary structure from the polypurine tract of murine leukemia virus showed that NC did indeed reduce pausing and stimulate continued synthesis of nascent DNA on donor template (36Wu W. Henderson L.E. Copeland T.D. Gorelick R.J. Bosche W.J. Rein A. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 7132-7142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). But in the presence of acceptor template, NC resolves pause sites with an accompanying increase in strand transfer (37Kim J.K. Palaniappan C. Wu W. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16769-16777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the NC effect on pause-mediated transfer occurs via the following steps: (i) it causes enhancement of RNase H activity of RT (38Wisniewski M. Chen Y. Balakrishnan M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 28400-28410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), (ii) it promotes strand exchange and annealing of the nascent DNA from the degraded donor RNA to the intact acceptor RNA (33DeStefano J.J.

In a recent publication, we reported the results of in vitro strand transfer assays that mimicked recombinational events occurring during reverse transcription in HIV-1 (48Derebail S.S. Heath M.J. DeStefano J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15702-15712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This was used to assess the role of NC and structural intricacies of genomic RNA in strand transfer. Synthesis on highly structured templates from the U3 3′-LTR, gag-pol frameshift region, and rev response element (RRE) showed intense pausing and strand transfer was strongly enhanced by NC. Weakly structured templates from the env and pol-vif regions were devoid of strong pause sites. To our surprise these regions transferred better than those with strong pause sites in the absence of NC, while showing a relatively modest enhancement with NC. The data lead to the basic hypothesis that pause sites can serve as the focal point for strand transfer, but low structured regions can promote transfer by rapid association of DNA and the acceptor RNA by a mechanism not dependent on strong pausing. Consequently, NC protein, which is known to unwind RNA structures (see above) shows modest stimulation of transfer in low structured regions, whereas, there is a high level of stimulation for structured regions. In this report, two of the regions from the previous article, one highly structured (gag-pol frameshift region, denoted Gag-Pol) and one with little structure (region from the env gene, denoted Env), were used to evaluate the different mechanisms of strand transfer. Various techniques including direct mapping of transfer crossover points under different conditions, and mutagenesis of the acceptor templates were used. Results supported the above hypothesis and showed that transfers were highly focused to the pause site region on GagPol. In contrast transfers on Env were more randomly dispersed and results supported a mechanism where the acceptor rapidly binds to the nascent DNA then displaces the donor at a downstream point as it “zippers” up the DNA. The second mechanism, which is similar to the “lock and dock” model for strand transfer (35Roda R.H. Balakrishnan M. Hanson M.N. Wohrl B.M. Le Grice S.F. Roques B.P. Gorelick R.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31536-31546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), represents a new model for transfers in regions with relatively low secondary structure and little pausing.

The primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was obtained from Stratagene. The PfuTurbo DNA polymerase used to introduce mutations into the pNL4–3 plasmid was from Stratagene. Plasmid pNL4-3, obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program contains a complete copy of the HIV-1 provirus derived from strains NY5 and LAV (49Adachi A.

Recombinant HIV-RT was provided to us by Genetics Institute (Cambridge, MA). This enzyme has a specific activity of ∼40,000 units/mg (one unit of RT is defined as the amount required to incorporate 1 nmol of dTTP into nucleic acid product in 10 min at 37 °C using oligo(dT)-poly(rA) as primer template). The enzyme contained very low levels of single-stranded nuclease activity, which was found to be inhibited by including 5 mm AMP in the assays (21DeStefano J.J. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 161-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At this concentration, the AMP did not affect the polymerase or RNase H activity of RT. Aliquots of HIV-RT were stored frozen at –70 °C, and a fresh aliquot was used for each experiment. The HIV-NC clone was a generous gift from Dr. Charles McHenry (University of Colorado). NC was purified according to the protocol described (50You J.C. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16519-16527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of the protein was evaluated using Coomassie Blue staining of 17.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (51Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed.

The Env acceptor was amplified using 5′-gatttaggtgacactatagtatataacacatctgtagaaattaa-3′ and 5′-ctatctgttttaaagtggca-3′ amplifying bases 7079–7250 while the –38 Env acceptor used 5′-gatttaggtgacactatagtatataacacatctgtagaaattaa-3′ and 5′-atgttacaatgtgcttgtca-3′ amplifying bases 7079–7212. PCR reactions were performed according to the enzyme manufacturer's protocol using the provided buffer. 100 pmol of each primer were used. The following cycling parameters were used; 35 cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension at temperatures of 94 °C, 50 °C, and 72 °C, respectively, for 1 min each, followed by one cycle of extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were purified on 8% native polyacrylamide gels (29:1 acrylamide: bisacrylamide) and used to prepare RNA as described below. The DNAs were excised and eluted overnight in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The eluate was separated from the gel by centrifugation and subsequent filtration through a 0.45-micron disposable syringe filter. The DNAs were recovered by precipitation in ethanol with 300 mm sodium acetate (CH3COO·3H2O). The amount of recovered DNAs was determined spectrophotometrically from optical density. Transcription Reactions to Prepare RNA Substrates—Run-off transcription (performed according to the enzyme manufacturer's protocol) was conducted using ∼5 μg of the purified PCR DNAs and SP6 RNA polymerase enzyme to generate RNA transcripts of 175 or 137 (–38 Env acceptor only) nucleotides. The transcription reactions were treated with 0.4-units/μl of DNase I/RNase-free enzyme for 15 min to digest away the template DNA. Then they were extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and precipitated with ethanol. The RNA pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of RNase-free water, loaded onto two successive hydrated Sephadex G-25 spin columns and processed according to the manufacturer's directions. The amount of recovered RNAs was determined spectrophotometrically from optical density. RNA preparations were also examined on polyacrylamide gels to ensure that only full-length RNAs were present. RNA-DNA Hybridization—DNA primers that bound specifically to the donor RNA transcripts were 32P-labeled at the 5′-end with T4 polynucleotide kinase according to the manufacturer's protocol. The donor RNA was hybridized to a complementary labeled primer by mixing primer:transcript at ∼5:1 ratio in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 80 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). The mixture was heated to 65 °C for 5 min and then slowly cooled to room temperature. Strand Transfer Time Course Reaction—Donor RNA-primer DNA hybrids (2 nm final concentration of RNA) were preincubated for 3 min in the presence or absence of 10 nm acceptor RNA template and NC (as indicated) in 42 μl of buffer (see below) at 37 °C. One molecule of NC per two nucleotides was used in the reactions. The reactions were initiated by the addition of 8 μl of HIV-RT at a final concentration of 2.5 units/μl. The following reagents at the indicated final concentrations were also included in the reaction mixtures: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 80 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 6 mm MgCl2, 100 μm dNTPs, 5 mm AMP, pH 7.0, 25 μm ZnCl2, and 0.4 units/μl RNase inhibitor. Reactions were allowed to incubate for time points of 0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 min at 37 °C. At these time points, a 6-μl aliquot of each reaction was terminated by mixing with 4 μl of a solution containing 25 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 2.5 ng of RNase/DNase-free enzyme and allowed to digest for 20 min at 37 °C. 2 μl of proteinase K at 2 mg/ml in 1.25% SDS, 15 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0 was then added to the above mixture, which was placed at 65 °C for 1 h. Finally, 12 μlof2× formamide dye (90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) was added to the mixture and the samples were resolved on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. Extended DNA products were quantified by phosphorimager analysis using a GS-525 phosphorimager from Bio-Rad. Strand transfer assays on the Env substrate were also conducted in the presence of suboptimal or saturating dNTP concentrations (1 or 100 μm, respectively). RNase Protection Assays—The structural features of the GagPol acceptor RNA was tested by RNase protection assays. The two enzymes used were T1 RNase and RNase A. The recovered RNAs from the above transcription reactions were dephosphorylated using calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reactions were extracted with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and precipitated with ethanol. The RNA precipitates were labeled at the 5′-end with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled RNAs were again gel-purified on 8% denaturing gels. The recovered labeled RNAs were quantified spectrophotometrically f"

The most abundant metabolite, 1, was previously identified as 2,3-dihydroxy-2′-chlorobiphenyl and was presumed to originate from the initial attack by the oxygenase on the chlorine-bearing ortho carbon and on its adjacent meta carbon of one phenyl ring. 2,3,2′,3′-Tetrachlorobiphenyl is transformed by LB400 BPDO into two metabolites that had never been fully characterized structurally. We determined the precise identity of the metabolites produced by LB400 BPDO from 2,2′-CB and 2,3,2′,3′-CB, thus providing new insights on the mechanism by which 2,2′-CB is dehalogenated to generate 2,3-dihydroxy-2′-chlorobiphenyl. We reacted 2,2′-CB with the BPDO variant p4, which produces a larger proportion of metabolite 2. The structure of this compound was determined as cis-3,4-dihydro-3,4-dihydroxy-2,2′-dichlorobiphenyl by NMR. Metabolite 1 obtained from 2,2′-CB-d8 was determined to be a dihydroxychlorobiphenyl-d7 by gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric analysis, and the observed loss of only one deuterium clearly shows that the oxygenase attack occurs on carbons 2 and 3. An alternative attack at the 5 and 6 carbons followed by a rearrangement leading to the loss of the ortho chlorine would have caused the loss of more than one deuterium. The major metabolite produced from catalytic oxygenation of 2,3,2′,3′-CB by LB400 BPDO was identified by NMR as cis-4,5-dihydro-4,5-dihydroxy-2,3,2′,3′-tetrachlorobiphenyl. These findings show that LB400 BPDO oxygenates 2,2′-CB principally on carbons 2 and 3 and that BPDO regiospecificity toward 2,2′-CB and 2,3,2,′,3′-CB disfavors the dioxygenation of the chlorine-free ortho-meta carbons 5 and 6 for both congeners. 2,2′-Dichlorobiphenyl (CB) is transformed by the biphenyl dioxygenase of Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 (LB400 BPDO) into two metabolites (1 and 2).

The major metabolite produced from catalytic oxygenation of 2,3,2′,3′-CB by LB400 BPDO was identified by NMR as cis-4,5-dihydro-4,5-dihydroxy-2,3,2′,3′-tetrachlorobiphenyl. These findings show that LB400 BPDO oxygenates 2,2′-CB principally on carbons 2 and 3 and that BPDO regiospecificity toward 2,2′-CB and 2,3,2,′,3′-CB disfavors the dioxygenation of the chlorine-free ortho-meta carbons 5 and 6 for both congeners. The enzymes of the bacterial biphenyl catabolic pathway are very versatile. They can co-metabolically transform several polychlorinated biphenyls (1Abramowicz D.A. Res. Microbiol. 1994; 145: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The initial reaction of this pathway is catalyzed by the biphenyl dioxygenase (BPDO) 1The abbreviations used are: BPDO, biphenyl dioxygenase; BphA, α subunit of BPDO oxygenase component; BphB, 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 2,3-dehydrogenase; BphC, 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 2,3-dioxygenase; ISPBPH, iron-sulfur protein; 2,2′-CB, 2,2′-dichlorobiphenyl; 3,3′-CB, 3,3′-dichlorobiphenyl; 4,4′-CB, 4,4′-dichlorobiphenyl; 2,5,2′,5′-CB, 2,5,2′,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl; 2,3,2′,3′-CB, 2,3,2′,3′-tetrachlorobiphenyl; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalacto-pyranoside; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; EI, electron impact; ppm, parts per million; PCB, polychlorinated biphenyl.1The abbreviations used are: BPDO, biphenyl dioxygenase; BphA, α subunit of BPDO oxygenase component; BphB, 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 2,3-dehydrogenase; BphC, 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 2,3-dioxygenase; ISPBPH, iron-sulfur protein; 2,2′-CB, 2,2′-dichlorobiphenyl; 3,3′-CB, 3,3′-dichlorobiphenyl; 4,4′-CB, 4,4′-dichlorobiphenyl; 2,5,2′,5′-CB, 2,5,2′,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl; 2,3,2′,3′-CB, 2,3,2′,3′-tetrachlorobiphenyl; IPTG, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalacto-pyranoside; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry; EI, electron impact; ppm, parts per million; PCB, polychlorinated biphenyl.

The cis-(2R,3S)-dihydroxy-1-phenylcyclohexa-4,6-diene (commonly called cis-2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl) generated by the catalytic oxygenation of biphenyl is dehydrogenated by the 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl-2,3-dehydrogenase (BphB) and the catechol produced is cleaved by the 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl-1,2-dioxygenase (BphC). The 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenyl-hexa-2,4-dienoic acid produced is then hydrolyzed by the 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenyl-hexa-2,4-dienoic acid hydrolase to yield benzoate and 2-hydroxypentanoate (Fig. 1). The substrate specificity of BPDO is crucial, because it limits the range of compounds that can potentially be degraded by the catabolic system. BPDO is a three-component enzymatic system (4Haddock J.D. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5834-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Haddock J.D. Pelletier D.A. Gibson D.T. J. Ind. Microbiol.

The first component is an iron-sulfur protein (ISPBPH) that interacts with the substrate to catalyze the addition of molecular oxygen. The second and third components are a flavoprotein reductase and a ferredoxin that are involved in the transfer of electrons from NADH to ISPBPH. BPDO components are coded by bphA (α-subunit of ISPBPH), bphE (β-subunit of ISPBPH), bphF (ferredoxin) and bphG (flavoprotein reductase) in Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 (7Denef V.J. Park J.

Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2903-2912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in Comamonas testosteroni B-356 (9Sylvestre M. Sirois M. Hurtubise Y. Bergeron J. Ahmad D. Shareck F. Barriault D. Guillemette I. Juteau J.M. Gene. 1996; 174: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).The three symmetrical 2,2′-, 3,3′-, and 4,4′-dichlorobiphenyls are not metabolized equally well by various BPDOs. C. testosteroni B-356 BPDO oxygenates 3,3′-dichlorobiphenyl much faster and more efficiently than it does 2,2′-dichlorobiphenyl and 4,4′-dichlorobiphenyl (10Hurtubise Y. Barriault D. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5828-5835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the catalytic activity of B. xenovorans LB400 BPDO toward 2,2′-dichlorobiphenyl is much greater than that of B-356 BPDO (10Hurtubise Y. Barriault D. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5828-5835Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but 3,3′-dichlorobiphenyl and 4,4′-dichlorobiphenyl are poor substrates for LB400 BPDO (11Mondello F.J. Turcich M.P. Lobos J.H. Erickson B.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3096-3103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enzyme, in fact, is among the few known BPDOs of natural occurrence that can efficiently metabolize the symmetrical ortho-substituted chlorobiphenyl 2,2′-CB and the symmetrical ortho-meta-substituted congeners 2,3,2′,3′-CB and 2,5,2′,5′-CB (11Mondello F.J. Turcich M.P. Lobos J.H. Erickson B.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3096-3103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Arnett C.M. Parales J.V. Haddock J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).The major metabolite of 2,2′-CB, representing about 90% of the product, was identified as 2,3-dihydroxy-2′-chlorobiphenyl (2Haddock J.D. Horton J.R. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 20-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This metabolite is believed to be produced from the oxygenase attack on the chlorinated side of one of the ring (2Haddock J.D. Horton J.R. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 20-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Seeger M. Camara B. Hofer B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3548-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) followed by concomitant dehalogenation. This type of oxygenation, leading to elimination of the chlorine atom, is a desirable feature of engineered enzymes, in that it facilitates down-stream degradation of the metabolites. The second metabolite obtained from 2,2′-CB (representing 10% or less of the product) was presumed to be the 5,6-dihydro-5,6-dihydroxy-2,2′-dichlorobiphenyl (2Haddock J.D. Horton J.R. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 20-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) based on the hypothesis that the enzyme normally catalyzes the oxygenation of vicinal ortho and meta carbons of biphenyl. Several other reports used these assumptions to interpret the metabolism of 2,2′-CB by engineered enzymes (13Seeger M. Camara B. Hofer B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3548-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Suenaga H. Watanabe T. Sato M. Ngadiman Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3682-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 15Zielinski M. Backhaus S. Hofer B. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2439-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In fact, in recent reports (13Seeger M. Camara B. Hofer B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3548-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 14Suenaga H. Watanabe T. Sato M. Ngadiman Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3682-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 15Zielinski M. Backhaus S. Hofer B. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2439-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), most of the conclusions drawn about regiospecificity alterations toward 2,2′-CB that occurred after the engineering of BPDOs were based on assumptions that need confirmation.A single metabolite is produced from 2,5,2′,5′-CB. In this case, the oxygenation occurs on vicinal meta-para carbons 3 and 4 (2Haddock J.D. Horton J.R. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 20-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); this represents a unique mode of oxygenation for BPDOs, which normally oxygenate the biphenyl ring on vicinal ortho-meta carbons. The metabolism of 2,3,2′,3′-CB was investigated by Arnett et al. (12Arnett C.M. Parales J.V. Haddock J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). They showed that the rate of oxidation of this congener is in the same range as for biphenyl. Two dihydro-dihydroxy-tetrachlorobiphenyls were produced from this congener, but their structure has not been determined unambiguously. Therefore, we do not know whether the regiospecificity of LB400 BPDO favors a meta-para or an ortho-meta oxygenation for 2,3,2′,3′-CB.Several reports (11Mondello F.J. Turcich M.P. Lobos J.H. Erickson B.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3096-3103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Suenaga H. Watanabe T. Sato M. Ngadiman Furukawa K. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3682-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 16Barriault D. Plante M.M. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3794-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 30Barriault D. Sylvestre M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47480-47488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) show that the sequence pattern of a stretch of seven amino acids of the C-terminal portion of BphA called region III strongly influences the range of PCB congeners that the enzyme can oxygenate efficiently, as well as its regiospecificity toward 2,2′-CB. Other amino acids, including residue 377 of LB400 BphA (11Mondello F.J. Turcich M.P. Lobos J.H. Erickson B.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 3096-3103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Barriault D. Plante M.M. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3794-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and several other residues that, according to a model of BPDO, have apparently no contact with the substrate (16Barriault D. Plante M.M. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3794-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), seem to act in association with residues of region III to influence the reaction turnover rates and regiospecificity toward chlorobiphenyls. Understanding how these amino acids interact with the substrate will have major effects on the design of strategies to engineer better enzymes. Precise identification of the metabolites generated from BPDO reaction will be essential to reach this goal.In a recent work, we created the BPDO variant p4 by substitution (T335A/F336M). This variant catalyzes the oxygenation of many PCB congeners more efficiently than LB400 BPDO (30Barriault D. Sylvestre M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47480-47488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It also exhibited an altered regiospecificity toward 2,2′-CB, producing as a major metabolite the dihydro-dihydroxy-dichlorobiphenyl normally reported as a minor metabolite by LB400 BPDO. However, the fact that the dihydroxy chlorobiphenyl derived from this metabolite was not cleaved by BphC (30Barriault D. Sylvestre M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47480-47488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) suggested that the oxygenation occurred on the meta and para carbons 3 and 4 or 4 and 5 of 2,2′-CB rather than on the ortho and meta carbons 5 and 6. This assumption was confirmed in the present study.Recent reports have suggested that not all dihydrodiol metabolites resulting from catalytic oxygenation of substituted biphenyl are stable. For example, 3,3′-dihydroxybiphenyl is converted to an unstable dihydrodiol metabolite that readily isomerizes to 3,4-dihydroxy-5-(3′-hydroxyphenyl)-5-cyclohexen-1-one, which is a dead-end metabolite (18Sondossi M. Barriault D. Sylvestre M. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Several hydroxychlorobiphenyls were also found to generate unstable dihydrodiol metabolites (19Francova K. Mackova M. Macek T. Sylvestre M. Environ. Pollut. 2004; 127: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this context, production of 2,3-dihydroxy-2′-chlorobiphenyl from 5,6-dihydro-5,6-dihydroxy-2,2′-dichlorobiphenyl by spontaneous elimination of hydrochloric acid cannot be excluded. In other words, we cannot exclude the possibility that the dehalogenation occurring after LB400 BPDO oxygenation of 2,2′-CB would be a fortuitous reaction resulting from the rearrangement of a dihydro-dihydroxy derivative instead of a reaction involving an interaction between the chlorinated carbon of the substrate with the enzyme active center. Therefore, the assumption that 2,3-dihydroxy-2′-chlorobiphenyl is produced from an oxygenase attack on carbons 2 and 3 of 2,2′-CB would also need to be confirmed.In this context, the objective of this work was to identify clearly the metabolites generated from 2,2′-CB and 2,3, 2′,3′-CB by LB400 BPDO and to get a clear demonstration of the mechanism by which 2,2′-CB is dehalogenated to generate 2,3-dihydroxy-2′-chlorobiphenyl.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Plasmids, and General Protocols—Escherichia coli DH11S (20Lin J.J. Smith M. Jessee J. Bloom F. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 718-721PubMed Google Scholar) was used in this study. Variant p4 is an evolved BPDO obtained by simultaneous random mutagenesis of the amino acid residues of region III of LB400 BphA (30Barriault D. Sylvestre M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47480-47488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The sequence pattern of p4 BphA is identical to that of LB400 BphA except for the mutations T335A and F336M. Plasmids pQE31[LB400-bphAE], pQE31[B-356-bphAE], and pQE31[p4-bphAE] were described previously (16Barriault D. Plante M.M. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3794-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 30Barriault D. Sylvestre M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47480-47488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The E. coli strains bearing these plasmids expressed His-tagged ISPBPH (16Barriault D. Plante M.M. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3794-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). DNA general protocols were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar).Chemicals—The chemicals used in this work were of the highest grade available commercially. 2,2′-CB and 2,3,2′,3′-CB were obtained from ULTRAScientific (Kingstown, RI). Biphenyl-d10 was obtained from CDN Isotope (Pointe-Claire, PQ, Canada). Chlorination was performed with 425 mg of biphenyl-d10 dissolved in 40 ml of hexane. Iron powder (100 mg) was added, and the mixture was cooled in an acetone/dry ice bath and saturated with chlorine gas. The mixture was warmed to room temperature and left overnight in the dark. The mixture was then extracted with 0.1 m NaOH and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent was evaporated. The residue was then purified by flash chromatography using hexane and on thick layer chromatography plates using cyclohexane as eluent. The fractions were then analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify those containing 2,2′-dichlorobiphenyl-d8.Preparation of Purified Enzyme Preparations and Enzyme Assay Conditions—The procedures to obtain His-tagged purified preparations of BPDO components from recombinant E. coli cells have been described previously (3Hurtubise Y. Barriault D. Sylvestre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8152-8156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), as was the procedure to obtained His-tagged purified BphB (22Sylvestre M. Hurtubise Y. Barriault D. Bergeron J. Ahmad D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 2710-2715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To produced His-tagged purified 1,2-dihydroxynaphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase, nahC was PCR-amplified using the antisense primers nahC-KpnI/FOR 5′-GTTCGGTACCCATGAGTAAGCAAGCTGCAG and nahC-KpnI/REV GATGGGTACCTTAACTCAGTTTTACATCCAG from plasmid NAH7 extracted from Pseudomonas putida G7 (23Simon M.J. Osslund T.D. Saunders R. Ensley B.D. Suggs S. Harcourt A. Suen W.C. Cruden D.L. Gibson D.T. Zylstra G.J. Gene. 1993; 127: 31-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The resulting 900-kb DNA fragment was cloned into the KpnI sites of pQE31. The resulting plasmid pQE31[nahC] was transformed into E. coli DH11S. The protocols used for expression and purification of the His-tagged enzyme was essentially the one described for B-356 BphC (24Hein P. Powlowski J. Barriault D. Hurtubise Y. Ahmad D. Sylvestre M. Can. J. Microbiol. 1998; 44: 42-49Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Production and Purification of Hydroxylated Metabolites from 2,2′-CB and 2,3,2′,3′-CB—2,2′-CB and 2,3,2′,3′-CB Metabolites were obtained from either whole-cell suspensions of E. coli [pDB31bphFG] + [pQE31bphAE] induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalacto-pyranoside (IPTG) or produced enzymatically using reconstituted BPDOs prepared from His-tagged purified components. For whole-cell reactions, Logphase cells in Luria Bertani broth (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) were induced for 2 h with 0.5 mm IPTG. Induced cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed, and suspended to an optical density at 600 nm of 2.0 in M9 medium (21Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 0.5 mm IPTG. This cell suspension was distributed by portions of 250 ml in 1-liter Erlenmeyer flasks. Each cell suspension received 100 μl of a 50 mm acetone solution of 2,2′-CB or 2,3,2′,3′-CB. The suspensions were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with shaking. Cell suspensions were extracted at neutral pH with ethyl acetate. A similar protocol was used to produce 3,4-dihydroxy-2,2′-dichlorobiphenyl from 3,4-dihydro-3,4-dihydroxy-2,2′-dichlorobiphenyl, except that the suspensions were prepared using E. coli [pQE31bphB] as described previously (22Sylvestre M. Hurtubise Y. Barriault D. Bergeron J. Ahmad D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 2710-2715Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Purified enzyme preparations were also used to prepare 2,2′-CB metabolites. The reaction conditions were then set as follows. The BPDO assays were performed in 200 μl of a 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, as described previously (3Hurtubise Y. Barriault D. Sylvestre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8152-8156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and the reaction was initiated by adding 100 nmol of 2,2′-CB dissolved in acetone. The enzyme-specific activities were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the consumption of NADH at 340 nm (3Hurtubise Y. Barriault D. Sylvestre M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8152-8156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) or by GC/MS analysis, by measuring the substrate depletion. The BphB assay was performed in 50 mm bicine buffer, pH 9.0, at 37 °C using between 200 ng and 50 μg of enzyme. Each reaction mixture (total volume 200 μl) contained 1.0 mm NAD+. The reaction was initiated by adding different amounts of a purified preparation of the 3,4-dihydro-3,4-dihydroxy-2,2′-dichlorobiphenyl. The reaction mixture was extracted with three volumes of ethyl acetate.In all cases, the ethyl acetate was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen and the residues were dissolved in a mixture of water/methanol/acetonitrile (50:25:25, v/v/v). The solution was injected onto a semipreparative Zorbax-ODS reversed phase column (9.4 × 25 cm). The column was equilibrated with water/methanol/acetonitrile (50:25:25). The compounds were eluted with a linear gradient to methanol/acetonitrile (80:20) in 30 min at 1 ml/min. The Agilent model 1314 variable wavelength detector was set at 276 nm, which was previously determined to be the maximal wavelength of the dihydro-dihydroxy-dichlorobiphenyl metabolite of 2,2′-CB (2Haddock J.D. Horton J.R. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 20-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the dihydro-dihydroxy-tetrachlorobiphenyl metabolite of 2,3,2′,3′-CB (12Arnett C.M. Parales J.V. Haddock J.D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 2928-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Using this system, the three metabolites generated from 2,2′-CB and the two metabolites generated from 2,3,2′,3′-CB by E. coli [pDB31bphFG] + [pQE31bphAE] eluted as distinct peaks. The peak corresponding to each metabolite was collected, the solvent phase was evaporated in a vacuum, and the residual aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate. The purity of each compound was confirmed by GC/MS analyses of their butylboronate or trimethylsilyl derivatives (16Barriault D. Plante M.M. Sylvestre M. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3794-3800Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 25Barriault D. Vedadi M. Powlowski J. Sylvestre M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Proton NMR spectra were obtained at the NMR spectrometry center of INRS-Institut Armand-Frappier with a Brucker 500-mHz spectrometer. The analyses were carried out in deuterated acetone, acetonitrile, and dimethyl sulfoxide at room temperature.Analysis of 2,2′-CB-d8 Metabolites—The 2,2′CB-d8 metabolites were produced by catalytic oxygenation using a reconstituted purified preparation of LB400 BPDO according to the protocols described above for 2,2′-CB metabolites. The metabolites were analyzed by GC/MS analysis using a Hewlett Packard HP6980 series gas chromatograph interfaced with an HP5973 mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies). The mass selective detector was operated in electron impact (EI) mode and used a quadrupole mass analyzer. Under these sets of conditions, the instrument resolution is 0.1 atomic mass units, which is well sufficient to clearly distinguish between two compounds of atomic masses differing by a single atomic mass unit.RESULTSProduction of 2,2′-CB Metabolites by LB400 and p4 BPDOs— The His-tagged purified preparations of LB400 BPDO used in this investigation had specific activities ranging from 120 to 150 nmol/min/mg of ISPBPH when biphenyl was the substrate compared with 350–400 nmol/min/mg for the specific activity of p4 BPDO. When 2,2′-CB was the substrate, the specific activities, based on substrate depletion, were between 35 and 55 nmol/min/mg ISPBPH for LB400 BPDO and 70 and 90 nmol/min/mg ISPBPH for the various enzyme preparations of p4 BPDO used in the study.When His-tagged purified preparations of LB400 BPDO were used to catalyze the oxygenation of 2,2′-CB, two metabolites (metabolites 1 and 2) were detected by GC/MS analysis of their butylboronate derivatives. The spectral features and GC retention time of butylboronate-derived metabolite 1 (shown in Fig. 2) were identical to those of the metabolite generated from 2-chlorobiphenyl by a coupled reaction catalyzed by LB400 BPDO plus BphB (data not shown). These features comprised a molecular ion at m/z 286, with diagnostically important ions at 230 [M– 56]+ and an ion of low abundance at m/z 194 [M – 56–36]+. Based on published data for butylboronate-derived 2,3-dihydroxy-4′-chlorobiphenyl, the major fragmentation sequence involved to the loss of the n-butyl moiety from the molecular ion with proton transfer [M – 56]+ followed by elimination of hydrochloric acid [M – 56–36]+ (26Massé R. Messier F. Ayotte C. Lévesque M.F. Sylvestre M. Biomed. Environ. Mass Spectrom. 1989; 18: 27-47Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These features, along with those from the literature, identified metabolite 1 as 2,3-dihydroxy-2′-chlorobiphenyl.Fig. 2Catalytic conversion of 2,2′-CB by LB400 and p4 BPDOs showing the ratio of metabolite 1 and 2 generated from 2,2′CB by LB400 BPDO (solid line) and p4 BPDO (dashed line) and the EI spectra of metabolites 1 and 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The mass spectrum of metabolite 2 is shown in Fig. 2. The spectrum is characterized by major ions at m/z 322, 287, 265, 238, and 222, which identified it as a dihydro-dihydroxy-dichlorobiphenyl. Based on previous reports (26Massé R. Messier F.

Mass Spectrom. 1989; 18: 27-47Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the EI fragmentation of butylboronate-derived dihydro-dihydroxy-dichlorobiphenyl should be initiated by the loss of a chlorine radical to yield an ion at m/z 287 [M+–35], whereas the elimination of the n-butyl moiety from M.+ should give rise to a cyclic oxonium-type ion of m/z 265 [M+–57]. EI also induced the loss of the neutral C4H9BO moiety to generate an ion at m/z 238 [M+–84] or the loss of the neutral nC4H9BO2 moiety to generate an ion at m/z 222 [M+ – 100].Together, these data show that metabolites 1 and 2 produced in a ratio of 90:10 correspond exactly to those obtained from a purified preparation of LB400 BPDO by Haddock et al. (2Haddock J.D. Horton J.R. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 20-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, metabolite 1 corresponded to 2,3-dihydroxy-2′-chlorobiphenyl, which was identified by NMR analysis by Haddock et al. (2Haddock J.D. Horton J.R. Gibson D.T. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 20-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because metabolite 2 was produced in large amounts when purified preparations of p4 BPDO were used to catalyze the oxygenation of 2,2′-CB (Fig. 2), we used this enzyme to produce and purify this compound for further analysis. GC/MS analysis of the high pressure liquid chromatography-purified preparation of metabolite 2 showed that its purity was higher than 99%. This purified dihydro-dihydroxy-dichlorobiphenyl compound was stable for days at 20 °C in ethyl acetate, acetonitrile, or acetone.When resting cell suspensions of E. coli [pQE31bphFG] + [pDB31 LB400-bphAE] or [pQE31bphFG] + [pDB31 p4-bphAE] were used to catalyze the oxygenation of 2,2′-CB, the same two metabolites were produced. Their ratio was slightly different from that obtained with purified enzyme preparations (30Barriault D. Sylvestre M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47480-47488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in this case, a third metabolite (metabolite 3) representing ∼1–5% of total metabolites was also detected. The molecular weight and mass spectral fragmentation patterns of its butylboronate derivative corresponded to a dihydroxy-"

Deregulation of the Cdk5 enzymatic activity was found to associate with a number of neurodegenerative diseases. To search for regulatory factors of Cdk5-p35 in the brain, we developed biochemical affinity isolation using a recombinant protein comprising the N-terminal 149 amino acids of p35. The catalytic α-subunit of protein kinase CK2 (formerly known as casein kinase 2) was identified by mass spectrometry from the isolation. The association of CK2 with p35 and Cdk5 was demonstrated, and the CK2-binding sites were delineated in p35. Furthermore, CK2 displayed strong inhibition toward the Cdk5 activation by p35. The Cdk5 inhibition is dissociated from the kinase function of CK2 because the kinase-dead mutant of CK2 displayed the similar Cdk5 inhibitory activity as the wild-type enzyme. Further characterization showed that CK2 blocks the complex formation of Cdk5 and p35. Together, these findings suggest that CK2 acts as an inhibitor of Cdk5 in the brain.

Cdk5 was identified independently on the basis of its sequence similarity to the family of Cdks, its interaction with cyclin D, and its protein kinase activity toward a proline-directed Ser/Thr sequence (1Meyerson M.

Despite having 60% sequence identity with Cdk1 and Cdk2, a role for Cdk5 in cell cycle regulation has yet to be identified. Nevertheless, Cdk5 has been implicated in the regulation of neuronal differentiation, degeneration, and cytoskeletal dynamics (4Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Monomeric Cdk5 shows no enzymatic activity because its activation is dependent on its association with the regulatory subunit p35 or p39, neither of which is a cyclin protein (5Lew J. Huang Q.Q.

Mammalian p35 and p39 are primarily expressed in post-mitotic neurons, thereby restricting Cdk5 activity predominantly to the nervous system (8Ko J. Humbert S. Bronson R.T. Takahashi S. Kulkarni A.B. Li E. Tsai L.H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6758-6771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cdk5 and p35 are essential for proper brain development. Mice deficient of Cdk5 or p35 display cell-positioning defects in the cerebral cortex (9Chae T. Kwon Y.T. Bronson R. Dikkes P. Li E. Tsai L.H.

In the brain, Cdk5-p35 phosphorylates a number of cytoskeletal proteins that are thought to play important roles in the reassembly of cytoskeletal elements, thereby mediating neurite outgrowth and neuronal migration during the development (11Baumann K.

In addition, there are several lines of evidence implicating aberrant regulation of Cdk5 in neurodegeneration and cell death (17Lim A.C. Qi R.Z. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2003; 5: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Indeed, p25, a truncated C-terminal fragment of p35, was found to accumulate in Alzheimer's disease brains; its associated-Cdk5 kinase activity was shown to lead to cytoskeletal disruption, morphological degeneration, and apoptosis (18Lee M.S.

Neuron. 2003; 40: 471-483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar).Cdk5 is involved in the regulation of many vital functions in the brain and, hence, its activity needs to be tightly controlled in the cells. Upon association with its activator p35 or p39, Cdk5 is regulated through various means, and many of its regulatory properties are distinct from those of the authentic Cdk-cyclin. First, p35 is an unstable protein with a half-life of 20–30 min during which it is multi-ubiquitylated and degrades through the ubiquitin-proteosome pathway (22Patrick G.N. Zhou P. Kwon Y.T.

Kishimoto T. Hisanaga S. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1189-1197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Secondly, in contrast to Cdk1 and Cdk2, the Cdk5 phosphorylation at Tyr-15, which is catalyzed by c-Abl and Fyn, is stimulatory but not inhibitory to Cdk5 kinase activity (24Zukerberg L.R. Patrick G.N. Nikolic M. Humbert S. Wu C.L. Lanier L.M. Gertler F.B. Vidal M. Van Etten R.A. Tsai L.H.

Next, the KIP and INK families of Cdk inhibitors do not show any activity toward Cdk5 (26Lee M.H. Nikolic M. Baptista C.A. Lai E. Tsai L.H. Massague J. Proc Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3259-3263Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies of Cdk5 in a bovine brain extract suggested the existence of inhibitory factor(s) together with Cdk5 and p35 in macromolecular protein complexes (27Lee K.Y. Rosales J.L. Tang D. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1538-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). More recently, protein C42, which was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid search, was reported as a down-regulator of Cdk5 activity (28Ching Y.P. Pang A.S. Lam W.H. Qi R.Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15237-15240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).A growing body of evidence has implicated Cdk5-p35 as a multifunctional enzyme that exists in many protein complexes in the cells (29Lim A.C. Qu D. Qi R.Z. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To learn more about the functional and regulatory properties of this kinase, a recombinant p35 fragment was utilized in the affinity isolation of p35-binding proteins from rat brain homogenates. Isolated proteins were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Here, we present the catalytic α-subunit of protein kinase CK2 as one of the proteins isolated. CK2α is able to interact physically with p35 and Cdk5. Using deletion mutants, CK2 is shown to bind to two regions located separately at the N- and C-terminal halves of p35. Moreover, the binding of CK2 to p35 or Cdk5 blocks the interaction between p35 and Cdk5, thereby inhibiting the p35-associated activation of Cdk5.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Constructs and Recombinant Proteins—Various fragments of p35, namely p10 (amino acids 1–98 of p35), p16 (amino acids 1–149 of p35), p35(53–149) (amino acids 53–149 of p35), p35(150–307) (amino acids 150–307 of p35), and p25 (amino acids 99–307 of p35), were engineered into pGEX vectors by polymerase chain reactions. CK2α and its kinase-dead mutant CK2αK68A were cloned into pET32a, and human CK2β was cloned into pQE30 (30Lim A.C. Tiu S.Y. Li Q. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4433-4439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Recombinant proteins tagged with GST 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; siRNA, small interfering RNA. or His6 were expressed in bacteria and purified as described in earlier reports (30Lim A.C.

Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was used for protein expression from pGEX and pET32a constructs, and E. coli M15 was the expression host for the pQE30 construct. To purify GST proteins, bacteria were lysed by sonication in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the Roche Applied Science protease inhibitor mixture) and clarified by centrifugation. After protein binding to GSH-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), the beads were washed with Buffer A supplemented with 0.5 m NaCl. GST proteins were eluted by 5 mm GSH in Buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and then dialyzed against Buffer B to remove GSH. Bacteria expressing His6-tagged proteins were lysed in Buffer C (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and the Roche Applied Science EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture) supplemented with 1% Triton X-100. After protein binding to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), unbound proteins were washed off using Buffer C. His6-tagged proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazole in Buffer C and then dialyzed in Buffer B.Isolation and Identification of p35-binding Proteins—The isolation of p35-binding proteins from rat brains was carried out essentially as described in an earlier report with modifications (31Qu D. Li Q. Lim H.Y. Cheung N.S. Li R. Wang J.H. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7324-7332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Rat brains were homogenized in Buffer D (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, and 3 μg/ml pepstatin). After centrifugation, the lysate was incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with GSH-Sepharose pre-coupled with 100 μg of GST-p16 or GST. The beads were washed extensively using Buffer D before the elution of associated proteins by Buffer D plus 1 m NaCl. Eluents were subjected to acetone precipitation and SDS-PAGE analysis. Protein bands that appeared in the GST-p16 pull-down but not in that of GST were excised for in-gel tryptic digestion (32Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7765) Google Scholar). Recovered peptides were analyzed on a quadrupole/time-of-flight hybrid mass spectrometer (QSTAR-Pulsar, Applied Biosystems/Sciex) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source. Protein identities were revealed by interrogating sequence databases with peptide sequence tags generated from tandem mass spectra (33Mann M. Wilm M. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 34Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar).Binding Assay—5 μg of GST-tagged proteins were incubated with 10 μg of CK2 proteins as indicated in 300 μl of Buffer D for 1 h at room temperature. The GST-tagged proteins were retrieved by further incubation with GSH-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with Buffer D. Bound proteins were released by boiling in the SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. Antibodies recognizing p35 (C-19), Cdk5 (C-8), CK2α, and CK2β were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.Protein Size Exclusion Chromatography—Rat brains were homogenized in Buffer E (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml antipain). Crude homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was then collected carefully. Using the fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences), the lysate containing 10-mg protein was applied onto a Superdex-200 column (HR16/50, Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in Buffer E. Proteins eluted by Buffer E were collected as 1-ml fractions. The whole procedure was carried out at 4 °C. Proteins in alternate fractions were concentrated by acetone precipitation and subjected to immunoblotting analysis using antibodies as indicated. The Superdex-200 column was calibrated under the same chromatography condition using a molecular mass calibration kit (Amersham Biosciences) containing blue dextran (2,000 kDa), thyroglobulin (670 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), and albumin (67 kDa).Cdk5 Kinase Assay—Cdk5 kinase assay was performed according to the method described previously with minor modifications (35Qi Z. Huang Q.Q. Lee K.Y. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10847-10854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, Cdk5 activity was measured by phosphorylating 100 μm histone H1 peptide HS(9–18) (PKTPKKAKKL) in 30 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (∼400 dpm/pmol) at 30 °C for 10 min. Reactions were terminated with the addition of trichloroacetic acid to 15% in the final volume. The samples were then set on ice for 10 min before being clarified by centrifugation. Supernatants were spotted onto P81 paper squares (Whatman). After the washing of the paper squares, phosphate incorporated into the histone H1 peptide was measured in a scintillation counter.Cell Transfection, RNA Interference, and Immunoprecipitation— COS-7 and SH-SY5Y cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection was carried out using Effectene (Qiagen) for 24 h. CK2α and CK2β were cloned into the bicistronic vector pBudCE4.1 (Invitrogen) for co-expression of the two proteins. The siRNA sequence used against human CK2α/α′ was described in an earlier report (30Lim A.C. Tiu S.Y. Li Q. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4433-4439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 20 μm CK2α/α′ siRNA or a scrambled siRNA sequence (Dharmacon) was applied into transfections using the TransIT-TKO reagent (Mirus). After transfection, the cells were further incubated for 48 h. For immunoprecipitation, rat brains or the transfected cells were lysed in Buffer F (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and the Roche Applied Science protease inhibitor mixture). After clarification, lysates were incubated overnight with antibodies as indicated at 4 °C before protein A beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added for a further incubation of 3 h at 4°C. The beads were retrieved and washed extensively with Buffer F. Proteins bound on the beads were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using antibodies as indicated. Antibodies against the V5 and c-Myc tags were from Invitrogen and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively.RESULTSIdentification of CK2α as a p35-binding Protein—To uncover regulators and effectors of the Cdk5-p35 kinase, we performed biochemical isolation of p35-interacting proteins from rat brains. Previous studies had implicated the importance of the N-terminal sequence of p35 in the formation of macromolecular complexes in the brain (29Lim A.C. Qu D. Qi R.Z. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, GST-p16, which comprises the N-terminal region next to the Cdk5-binding domain of p35, was constructed to serve as the bait in the isolation. Proteins bound to p16 from the brain extract were released under the high salt condition (1 m NaCl) and subsequently resolved by SDS-PAGE. From several independent pull-downs, a protein band at ∼45 kDa was observed consistently from the GST-p16 pull-downs, but not in those of GST (Fig. 1A). The protein band was excised and subjected to in-gel digestion and mass spectrometric analysis. A search in sequence databases with tandem mass spectrometric data generated from several prominent peptide signals showed that the sequences of these peptides match those from the catalytic α-subunit of rat protein kinase CK2 (data not shown). To confirm this result, samples from a subsequent pull-down were used for immunoblotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 1B, the immunoblot clearly indicated that CK2α was specifically pulled down by GST-p16. Interestingly, a shorter N-terminal fragment of p35, namely GST-p10 (amino acids 1–98 of p35), failed to pull down CK2α from the brain extract (Fig. 1B), implying that the region spanning the residues 99–149 of p35 is necessary for the association with CK2α.CK2α Exists in Complexes with p35 and Cdk5 in the Rat Brain—Rat brain extract was fractionated by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex-200 column. Fractions were collected and immunoblotted to examine the elution patterns of the Cdk5, p35, and CK2 proteins. Fig. 2A shows the elution profiles derived. Almost all of p35 was found to be eluted in the macromolecular weight fractions, migrating nearly at the void volume of the column. Cdk5 was eluted across a fairly broad range of elution positions, which is characteristic of various Cdk5 complexes present in the brain extract. Substantial amounts of Cdk5 were found in the macromolecular weight fractions containing p35 as well as in the low molecular weight fractions corresponding to the molecular mass of ∼30 kDa, characteristic of its monomeric form. CK2α immunoreactivity was detected in the macromolecular weight fractions of p35 and Cdk5, with the peak staining closely aligned with that of p35 (Fig. 2A). Intriguingly, the macromolecular weight fractions containing Cdk5, p35, and CK2α were completely devoid of CK2β (Fig. 2A), suggesting that CK2α but not the holoenzyme exists with Cdk5 and p35 in large protein complexes in the brain. To further demonstrate the association of CK2α with Cdk5 and p35, co-immunoprecipitation was performed using the rat brain lysate. As shown in Fig. 2B, CK2α was specifically detected in the immunocomplexes resulting from anti-p35 and anti-Cdk5 immunoprecipitations. Indeed, both p35 and Cdk5 were also observed in the CK2α immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2C), providing evidence for the existence of CK2α in the complexes of p35 and Cdk5.Fig. 2CK2α exists in complexes with Cdk5 and p35 in the rat brain. A, rat brain lysate containing 10 mg of protein was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex-200 column. Proteins in alternate fractions were precipitated by acetone and subsequently immunoblotted with antibodies recognizing Cdk5, p35, CK2α, and CK2β. B and C, co-immunoprecipitation of Cdk5 and p35 with CK2α. Rat brain lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with the p35- and Cdk5-specific antibodies (B) and the CK2α-specific antibody (C), followed by immunoblotting of the immunoprecipitates. Nonspecific rabbit IgG was used in the control immunoprecipitation at equal amounts of the specific antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Direct Association of CK2 with p35 and Cdk5—We next examined the physical association of CK2 with p35 and Cdk5 using purified recombinant proteins. The CK2 holoenzyme was reconstituted from individual recombinant α- and β-subunits. GST-tagged p35 and Cdk5 were individually incubated with CK2α, CK2β, or the holoenzyme. The GST-tagged proteins were subsequently retrieved using GSH beads to analyze coprecipitated proteins by immunoblotting. CK2α and CK2β immunoblots clearly showed the physical association of p35 with CK2α and the holoenzyme but not with CK2β alone (Fig. 3A). In addition to p35, Cdk5 displayed direct binding to CK2α, although it failed to interact with the CK2 holoenzyme (Fig. 3A). Taken together, p35 is able to associate with the CK2 holoenzyme via its interaction with CK2α, whereas Cdk5 binds only to CK2α.Fig. 3Direct binding of CK2 to p35 and Cdk5. A, CK2 interacts with p35 and Cdk5. 10 μg of GST-p35 or GST-Cdk5 were incubated individually with CK2α (0.5 μg), CK2β (0.5 μg), and the CK2 holoenzyme (1 μg). After retrieval of the GST proteins using GSH beads, bound proteins were immunoblotted using a mixture of the CK2α and CK2β antibodies. B, mapping CK2-binding sites in p35. 10 μg of GST-tagged p35 fragments or GST were incubated with CK2α (0.5 μg). GSH beads were then used to retrieve the GST proteins, and retrieved proteins were analyzed by anti-CK2α immunoblotting. p35 constructs used in the binding assay are illustrated below the immunoblot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Upon identifying CK2α as a binding partner of p35, we proceeded to delineate the CK2-binding region(s) in p35. Various fragments of p35 were constructed as shown in Fig. 3B and prepared as recombinant GST-tagged proteins. p16, but none of its further truncated constructs, interacted with CK2α in the binding assays, indicating that further truncations of p16 abolished its CK2-binding capability (Fig. 3B). Unexpectedly, p25 and a truncated C-terminal fragment of p25, namely p35(150–307), exhibited interaction with CK2α, although their bindings were relatively weak (Fig. 3B). In p35, the Cdk5-binding and -activating domain is located at the region spanning amino acids 150–292 (36Tang D. Chun A.C. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 37Poon R.Y. Lew J. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5703-5708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Therefore, CK2 appeared to interact with two regions of p35 at different affinities; one of them overlaps the Cdk5-binding domain.CK2 Inhibits Cdk5 Activation—Cdk5 can be highly activated by reconstitution with p35 or its truncated fragment, p25 (35Qi Z. Huang Q.Q. Lee K.Y. Lew J. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10847-10854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To understand the functionality of the CK2 interaction with p35 and Cdk5, we carried out Cdk5 activation using recombinant proteins and examined potential CK2 effects on Cdk5 kinase activity. Kinase assays showed that the reconstitution of Cdk5 and p35 in the presence of CK2α or the CK2 holoenzyme resulted in inhibition of the Cdk5 activity in a CK2 dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Compared with CK2α, the CK2 holoenzyme exhibited a slightly higher potency in the Cdk5 inhibition (Fig. 4A). Because p25 constitutes the second binding site for CK2, we went on to examine the effect of CK2 on the p25 activation of Cdk5. Similarly, CK2α and the CK2 holoenzyme strongly inhibited the Cdk5 activity when they were included in the reconstitution mixture of Cdk5 and p25 (Fig. 4B). Hence, both the p35 and the p25 activation of Cdk5 can be readily blocked by CK2α or the CK2 holoenzyme.Fig. 4CK2 inhibits Cdk5 activation. A, CK2 inhibits the p35 activation of Cdk5. GST-Cdk5 (0.28 μm) was incubated with GST-p35 (0.27 μm) in the presence of an increasing amount of CK2α or the CK2 holoenzyme. Samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature before being assayed for Cdk5 kinase activity. B, CK2 inhibits the p25 activation of Cdk5. GST-Cdk5 (0.28 μm) was incubated with GST-p25 (0.33 μm) and CK2α (3.79 μm) or the CK2 holoenzyme (1.19 μm) for 1 h at room temperature. The kinase activity of Cdk5 was then determined and expressed as percentages of that in the absence of the CK2 proteins. Data shown here are averages of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To further demonstrate Cdk5 inhibition by CK2, we introduced p35 and CK2 into cultured COS-7 cells by transient transfection. Cdk5 is a ubiquitously expressed protein. Western blots detected expressed p35 and CK2 proteins as well as endogenous Cdk5 in the cells (Fig. 5). p35 was immunoprecipitated to measure its associated Cdk5 activity. When p35 was transfected without CK2, a high kinase activity of Cdk5 was detected from the p35 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 5). In the double transfection of p35 and the construct expressing CK2α or the CK2 holoenzyme (CK2α/CK2β), the p35-associated Cdk5 activity was significantly reduced (Fig. 5). In agreement with the in vitro reconstitution assays, the expression of the CK2 holoenzyme yielded a slightly stronger Cdk5 inhibition compared with that of CK2α (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Cdk5 is inhibited by CK2 in transfected COS-7 cells. COS-7 cells were double transfected with the p35 plasmid and the plasmid expressing CK2α or the holoenzyme CK2α/CK2β (CK2holo). The vector of CK2 was co-transfected with p35 in the control experiment. Expressed CK2α and CK2β proteins contain V5 and c-Myc tags, respectively. Protein expression was detected in the cell lysates by immunoblots against V5, c-Myc, p35, and Cdk5. Following anti-p35 immunoprecipitation, the activity of co-precipitated Cdk5 was determined and expressed as percentages of that in the control sample. The plot is the average of three individual experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To evaluate the physiological role of CK2 on Cdk5 activity, we knocked down CK2α/α′ in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells using a siRNA duplex. As shown by cell lysate immunoblots, the introduction of CK2α/α′-specific siRNA led to a significant decrease of the cellular CK2α protein level (Fig. 6A), whereas the protein contents of Cdk5 and p35 were not affected (data not shown). To assess the knockdown effect on Cdk5 activity, p35 was immunoprecipitated, and its associated Cdk5 activity was assayed. The introduction of CK2α/α′-specific siRNA yielded a notably higher Cdk5 activity as compared with that of the control sample (scrambled siRNA sequence) (Fig. 6B), implicating the Cdk5 inhibitory effect of CK2 in the cells.Fig. 6CK2 inhibits Cdk5 activity in neuroblastoma cells. SH-SY5Y cells were introduced with the siRNA of human CK2α/α′ or a scrambled sequence. A, the knockdown of CK2α/α′ was monitored by anti-CK2α immunoblotting. B, following the immunoprecipitation of p35, the activity of co-precipitated Cdk5 was determined.

https://openalex.org/W2060706481,"The B-subunit component of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (EtxB), which binds to cell surface GM1 ganglioside receptors, was recently shown to be a highly effective vehicle for delivery of conjugated peptides into the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I pathway. In this study we have investigated the pathway of epitope delivery. The peptides used contained the epitope either located at the C terminus or with a C-terminal extension. Pretreatment of cells with cholesterol-disrupting agents blocked transport of EtxB conjugates to the Golgi/endoplasmic reticulum, but did not affect EtxB-mediated MHC class I presentation. Under these conditions, EtxB conjugates entered EEA1-positive early endosomes where peptides were cleaved and translocated into the cytosol. Endosome acidification was required for epitope presentation. Purified 20 S immunoproteasomes were able to generate the epitope from peptides in vitro, but 26 S proteasomes were not. Only presentation from the C-terminal extended peptide was proteasome-dependent in cells, and this was found to be significantly slower than presentation from peptides with the epitope at the C terminus. These results implicate the proteasome in the generation of the correct C terminus of the epitope and are consistent with proteasome-independent N-terminal trimming. Epitope presentation was blocked in a TAP-deficient cell line, providing further evidence that conjugated peptides enter the cytosol as well as demonstrating a requirement for the peptide transporter. Our findings demonstrate the utility of EtxB-mediated peptide delivery for rapid and efficient loading of MHC class I epitopes in several different cell types. Conjugated peptides are released from early endosomes into the cytosol where they gain access to proteasomes and TAP in the “classical” pathway of class I presentation.

Cresswell P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 323-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). The majority of peptides presented are generated from endogenously synthesized proteins that are degraded by the proteasome (reviewed in Refs. 2Goldberg A. Cascio P. Saric T. Rock K. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 39: 147Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar and 3Kloetzel P.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). These are subsequently transported into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by the transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP). In the ER, peptides bind to newly synthesized MHC class I molecules, which are then transported to the cell surface for recognition by CD8+ T-cells. This leads to T-cell activation, and eventually to cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocyte-mediated lysis of peptide-presenting cells. Activation of cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes is obviously an important strategy for vaccination. However, exogenous soluble antigens generally fail to gain access to the cytosolic compartment of cells, and thus novel strategies of targeting this pathway are needed. One strategy that is receiving attention is the use of protein delivery vehicles that possess an inherent capacity to enter mammalian cells (reviewed in Refs. 4Smith D.C. Lord J.M. Roberts L.M. Tartour E. Johannes L. Traffic. 2002; 3: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar and 5De Haan L. Hirst T.R. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2002; 5: 269-278PubMed Google Scholar). This is exemplified by bacterial A-B type toxins that, following binding by the B component to cell surface receptors, deliver the A component into the cytosol. Several investigators have attempted to exploit such toxins by fusing antigens to the toxin A component. For example, inactive derivatives of diphtheria toxin (6Stenmark H. Moskaug J.O. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), adenylate cyclase toxin of Bordetella pertussis (7Saron M.F. Fayolle C. Sebo P. Ladant D. Ullmann A. Leclerc C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3314-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and anthrax toxin (8Ballard J.D. Collier R.J. Starnbach M.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12531-12534Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) have been successfully used to deliver fused or conjugated epitopes into the MHC class I pathway. Recently, we reported that the B-subunit of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (EtxB) can be used as a delivery vehicle for model class I epitopes, namely the SIINFEKL epitope of chicken ovalbumin and the ASNENMETM nucleoprotein epitope from influenza virus (9De Haan L. Hearn A.R. Rivett A.J. Hirst T.R. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3249-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In these instances, epitope presentation by MHC class I molecules was found to require conjugation of peptides to EtxB and binding of the EtxB-peptide conjugates to GM1 ganglioside receptors. Moreover, a significant enhancement in the efficiency of epitope presentation was achieved by incorporating, adjacent to the epitope, a sequence derived from the DNA polymerase (Pol) of herpes simplex virus type 1. This 10-amino acid stretch of non-polar and charged residues (AVGAGATAEE), termed the Pol-loop segment, has been proposed to have an intrinsic propensity to insert into lipid bilayers, thereby enhancing translocation (10Loregian A. Papini E. Satin B. Marsden H.S. Hirst T.R. Palu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5221-5226Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). When an EtxB conjugate containing a 31-mer peptide (CEKLAGFGAVGAGATAEESIINFEKLTEWTS) with an internal SIINFEKL epitope was evaluated, epitope presentation on MHC class I molecules was found to be inhibited by addition of epoxomicin, an inhibitor of the proteasome. This finding is consistent with epitope entry into the cytosol. However, because proteasomes are involved in ER-associated protein degradation as well as proteolysis of cytosolic proteins and several other toxins are known to exploit the retrograde transport system, the route of peptide delivery was not clear. Confocal microscopy of the uptake of EtxB-peptide conjugates showed the EtxB moiety in the Golgi/ER compartment. Because presentation of the SIINFEKL epitope by the EtxB-19-mer conjugate is so rapid, the possibility remains that the epitope may be delivered directly into the Golgi/ER where loading of MHC class I molecules could occur. In this study we have investigated the trafficking pathway of EtxB-peptide conjugates to assess whether epitope presentation is because of peptide translocation into the cytosol or direct EtxB-mediated peptide delivery into the ER. The results demonstrate (i) that EtxB-mediated epitope presentation does not require trafficking of the EtxB moiety to the Golgi/ER, (ii) that epitope translocation into the cytosol occurs from an acidified endocytic compartment, (iii) that immunoproteasomes can generate the active epitope in vitro but presentation is only proteasome-dependent in cells when a C-terminal extended epitope is used, (iv) that this pathway is not specific to dendritic cells, and (v) that presentation requires a functional TAP transporter. Production of EtxB Conjugates—Recombinant EtxB was expressed in a nontoxigenic marine vibrio, Vibrio sp. 60, and purified as previously described (11Amin T. Hirst T.R. Protein Expression Purif. 1994; 5: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Purified preparations of EtxB were depleted of lipopolysaccharide using Detoxi-Gel™ AffinityPak™ columns (Pierce) and contained <50 endotoxin units/mg of protein as determined in a Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). The peptides used in this study were synthesized by solid-phase synthesis by Dr. G. Bloomberg at the Peptide Synthesis Unit of the Department of Biochemistry, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK. They were purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and their molecular masses confirmed by mass spectrometry. The peptides were 8-mer epitope (SIINFEKL), 19-mer peptide (CAVGAGATAEESIINFEKL), 26-mer peptide (CEKLAGFGAVGAGATAEESIINFEKL), and 31-mer peptide (CEKLAGFGAVGAGATAEESIINFEKLTEWTS). EtxB-peptide conjugates were generated using the bifunctional cross-linker N-(γ-maleimidobutyryloxy)succinimide (Pierce) as previously described (9De Haan L. Hearn A.R. Rivett A.J. Hirst T.R. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3249-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and the average ratio of the conjugated peptide to the EtxB pentamer was 5:1. Cell lines and Culture Conditions—JAWSII cells, an immortalized dendritic cell line derived from the bone marrow of C57BL/6 mice, were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). They were cultured in RP10 medium (RPMI 1640 containing Glutamax-I, 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (all from Invitrogen), supplemented with 2 ng/ml recombinant mouse granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor (Sigma), at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. TAP-2-deficient T cell lymphoma RMA-S cells (12Yang Y. Fruh K. Chambers J. Waters J.B. Wu L. Spies T. Peterson P.A. J. Biol.

Hamster lung carcinoma cell line E36.12.4 stably transfected with H-2Kb (13Craiu A. Akopian T. Goldberg A. Rock K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10850-10855Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and the T-cell hybridoma RF33.70 that recognizes the ovalbumin-derived SIINFEKL epitope in the context of H-2b MHC class I molecules (14Rock K.L. Rothstein L. Gamble S. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 804-811PubMed Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Dr. K. L. Rock (University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester, MA). E36.12.4 cells were cultured in RP10 supplemented with 400 μg/ml G-418 and the RF33.70 cells were cultured in RP10 medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, 1 mm non-essential amino acids, 25 μm indomethacin, 0.25 μg/ml fungizone-1 (all from Invitrogen), and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. Antigen Presentation Assays—The T-cell hybridoma RF33.70 cells were used to detect the level of the SIINFEKL epitope bound to MHC class I molecules at the surface of the antigen presenting cells (14Rock K.L. Rothstein L. Gamble S. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 804-811PubMed Google Scholar). On recognition of the epitope these cells produce IL-2. Therefore epitope presentation by JAWSII dendritic cells, E36.12.4 hamster lung carcinoma cells, and RMA lymphoma cells were examined by monitoring the IL-2 released. JAWSII cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 5 × 104 cells/well and cultured overnight. E36 cells were seeded at 1–5 × 104 for 2–4 h, and RMA and RMA-S cells were seeded at 1 × 106/ml for 2 h prior to the addition of test samples. Duplicate aliquots of cells were incubated for 2 h with duplicates of each test sample that contained peptide alone, peptide admixed with EtxB, or EtxB-peptide conjugates, all at a concentration of 100 nm peptide. Treatment of cells with the 8-mer epitope (to give the maximal level of SIINFEKL bound to MHC I) and PBS alone were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Following incubation with antigen, cells were fixed for 10 min with 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature, washed five times with medium, and incubated overnight with RF33.70 T-cell hybridoma seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well. Following overnight incubation, presentation-induced IL-2 secretion was detected using a commercially available IL-2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit, which was used according to the instructions of the manufacturer (BD Pharmingen). IL-2 levels are given as mean units per ml ± S.E. Presented data are representative of at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance was assessed by the Student's t test. A probability value (p) of <0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. The inhibitory effects of filipin (10 μg/ml), methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) (10 mm), bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), brefeldin A, leupeptin (100 μm), pepstatin (100 μm), bestatin (100 μm) (all from Sigma), and epoxomicin (10 μm), lactacystin (10 μm), and MG-132 (10 μm) (all from Calbiochem, Nottingham, UK) on EtxB-mediated epitope delivery were also studied. In such experiments JAWSII cells were pretreated with inhibitor 1 h prior to the addition of the EtxB conjugate, and were present throughout the duration of the incubation of the cells with antigen. When cells were incubated with filipin and an additional inhibitor cells were first incubated with filipin for 1 h and then incubated with filipin plus the second inhibitor for 1 h. Degradation of Peptides by Purified Proteasomes—Rat liver 20 S and 26 S proteasomes and rat spleen 20 S immunoproteasomes, which contain the γ-interferon-inducible subunits (kindly provided by K. Forti, Department of Biochemistry, University of Bristol) were purified as previously described (15Rivett A.J. Savory P.J. Djaballah H.

Peptide at a final concentration of 12 pmol/ml in PBS was incubated with proteasome (2 μg) for 6 or 8 h at 37 °C and then incubated for 5 min with JAWSII cells at a final concentration equivalent to 350 nm peptide. In some experiments proteasome was preincubated for 1 h with epoxomicin (10 μm) before addition of peptide. The cells were then fixed with 1% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and antigen presentation was analyzed as above. Confocal Microscopy—For analysis by immunofluorescence microscopy, JAWSII cells were first grown for 48 h on sterile coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma). Subsequently, cells were treated with 100 nm EtxB-peptide conjugate for 2 h. In some experiments cells were pretreated with filipin for 1 h prior to the addition of conjugate. In these experiments filipin was present throughout the incubation with antigen. After incubation with conjugate cells were fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 4% paraformaldehyde, and then incubated for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) to permeabilize the cells. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h with either EtxB-specific polyclonal rabbit antiserum (kindly provided by Dr. M. Pizza, IRIS, Sienna, Italy) or EtxB-specific monoclonal antibody 118-8 (kindly provided by E. Lundgren and H. Persson, University of Umea, Sweden), both diluted in PBS/bovine serum albumin (PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin, fraction V, Sigma). The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h with either antibodies against early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO), specific markers for the early endosome (17Mu F.T.

Next, cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate- or TRITC-labeled secondary antibodies directed against either mouse or rabbit immunoglobulin G (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in PBS/bovine serum albumin for 1 h. The washed coverslips were then mounted and fixed onto glass examination slides spotted with Mowiol containing 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) anti-fading and the DNA-binding agent 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (1 mg/ml) for nuclear staining. Coverslips were examined using a Leica DH1RBE inverted confocal microscope (Leica, Buffalo, NY) in the School of Medical Sciences Cell Imaging Facility, University of Bristol. Filipin Inhibits Trafficking of EtxB Peptide Conjugates—The ubiquitously expressed glycospingolipid ganglioside GM1, which is highly enriched in lipid rafts, is the main functional receptor of Etx and its close homologue Ctx (19Wolf A.A.

Depletion, redistribution, or removal of plasma membrane cholesterol by the sterol-binding agents, filipin and MCD, disrupt lipid rafts and have been shown to inhibit trafficking of the toxins to the Golgi/ER (20Orlandi P.A. Fishman P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 905-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 21Wolf A.A. Fujinaga Y. Lencer W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16249-16256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In an attempt to determine whether the trafficking of EtxB-peptide conjugates in JAWSII dendritic cells is inhibited by filipin and MCD and whether or not this affects efficient EtxB-mediated epitope delivery, the cells were treated with 10 μg/ml filipin or 10 mm MCD for 1 h prior to addition of the EtxB-19-mer or EtxB-31-mer peptide conjugates containing the ovalbumin-derived SIINFEKL epitope. Confocal microscopy revealed that filipin inhibited the intracellular trafficking of the EtxB-peptide conjugates (Fig. 1). Monoclonal antibody 118-8, specific for the EtxB pentamer was used to monitor the trafficking of the EtxB moiety, whereas rhodamine-labeled WGA, which has affinity for N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminyl residues and N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamine oligomers, was used to stain plasma and Golgi/ER membranes (22Tartakoff A.M. Vassalli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1243-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In the absence of filipin, it can be seen that 2 h after addition of either the EtxB-19-mer or EtxB-31-mer conjugates, the EtxB moieties are clearly detected at the cell surface and in the perinuclear region, indicating toxin binding and internalization (Fig. 1A, images a–d). The co-localization of the internalized EtxB with WGA is indicative of conjugate trafficking to the Golgi/ER (Fig. 1A, images c and d). By contrast, when cells were pretreated with filipin, the EtxB moieties of the conjugates were found in a location proximal to the cell surface, with none in a perinuclear location (Fig. 1B, images a–d). The detected EtxB moieties did not appear to be in the same location as surface-located WGA, as the fluorophors were not entirely superimposable (compare Fig. 1B, image c, with Fig. 1A, image c); or to be present in lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 containing lysosomes (Fig. 1B, images e–h). Strikingly, the EtxB moieties present in the filipin-treated cells fully co-localized with the early endosomal marker, EEA1 (Fig. 1B, images i–l). Identical results were also obtained when the cells were treated with MCD prior to EtxB conjugate uptake (data not shown). We therefore conclude that disruption of cholesterol-containing membrane microdomains by filipin or MCD blocks EtxB conjugate trafficking to the Golgi, but permits uptake into an early endosomal EEA1-positive compartment. Filipin and MCD Do Not Inhibit Antigen Presentation—To determine whether the failure of the EtxB-peptide conjugates to traffic to the Golgi/ER affects EtxB-mediated epitope delivery, JAWSII cells were treated with 10 μg/ml filipin or 10 mm MCD prior to addition of the EtxB-19-mer or EtxB-31-mer peptide conjugates and then the presentation of the SIINFEKL epitope was monitored in a standard antigen presentation assay by measuring IL-2 release by the SIINFEKL-specific RF33.70 T-cell hybridoma. In these experiments, free 8-mer SIINFEKL peptide was used as a positive control. This peptide can displace peptides already bound to MHC class I molecules on the cell surface, without the need for intracellular processing. We found that treatment with filipin had no significant effect on SIINFEKL epitope presentation using the EtxB-19-mer or EtxB-31-mer conjugates (Fig. 2A). Similar levels of SIINFEKL epitope presentation were also observed when using the free 8-mer SIINFEKL epitope at an equivalent peptide concentration, and importantly, treatment of JAWSII cells with filipin did not affect the direct loading of the free 8-mer peptide. Results obtained with MCD were in complete agreement with the data obtained with filipin (Fig. 2B). Accordingly, the extent of epitope presentation observed following treatment with MCD and the EtxB-19-mer and EtxB-31-mer conjugates were comparable with those obtained in the absence of MCD or with free 8-mer SIINFEKL peptide. MCD also had no affect on the direct loading of the free 8-mer peptide. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that trafficking of EtxB conjugates to an early endosomal compartment is sufficient for EtxB-mediated epitope delivery into the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway. Epitope Presentation in Filipin-treated Cells Requires Endosomal Acidification—BafA1, an inhibitor of endosomal acidification (23Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar), prevents EtxB-mediated epitope presentation (9De Haan L. Hearn A.R. Rivett A.J. Hirst T.R. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 3249-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). JAWSII cells were pretreated with 10 μg/ml filipin and 200 nm BafA1 as described under “Experimental Procedures” prior to the addition of the EtxB-19-mer or EtxB-31-mer conjugates. As shown in Fig. 3, addition of BafA1 to filipin-treated JAWSII cells strongly inhibited the ability of EtxB to deliver the SIINFEKL epitope into the MHC class I presentation pathway (compare Fig. 3, A and B). This implies that the early endosomal compartments in which EtxB conjugates accumulate in filipin-treated cells (Fig. 1B, image i–l), must be acidified for efficient peptide release and antigen presentation. In filipin-treated cells brefeldin A, which disrupts the Golgi complex (24Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yuan L.C. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1989; 56: 801-813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar), prevented epitope delivery from both the EtxB-19-mer and EtxB-31-mer conjugates (Fig. 3, C and D). These results demonstrate that even in the presence of filipin an intact Golgi is required, presumably to allow trafficking of peptide-MHC class I complexes to the cell surface. Epoxomicin, a potent proteasome inhibitor (25Meng L. Mohan R. Kwok B.H. Elofsson M. Sin N. Crews C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10403-10408Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), was found to selectively inhibit epitope delivery from the EtxB-31-mer but not the EtxB-19-mer conjugate whether cells were treated with filipin or not (Fig. 3, E and F). Effects of Protease Inhibitors on EtxB-mediated Epitope Delivery—To further characterize epitope generation during EtxB-mediated epitope delivery of conjugated peptides into the MHC class I pathway, the effects of a range of protease inhibitors were investigated. These included: (i) leupeptin, an inhibitor of lysosomal serine and cysteine proteases (26Saino T. Someno T. Ishii S. Aoyagi T. Umezawa H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1988; 41: 220-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); (ii) pepstatin, an inhibitor of aspartic proteases, cathepsin D (27Rich D.H. Bernatowicz M.S. Agarwal N.S. Kawai M. Salituro F.G. Schmidt P.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3165-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), and cathepsin E (28Nishioku T. Hashimoto K. Yamashita K. Liou S.Y. Kagamiishi Y. Maegawa H.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 784-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); and (iv) proteasome inhibitors epoxomicin (25Meng L. Mohan R. Kwok B.H. Elofsson M. Sin N. Crews C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10403-10408Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar), lactacystin (30Dick L.R. Cruikshank A.A. Grenier L. Melandri F.D. Nunes S.L. Stein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7273-7276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), and MG-132 (31Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). JAWSII cells were preincubated with inhibitor for 1 h, after which 100 nm EtxB-19-mer or -31-mer conjugate was added. Table I shows that treatment with leupeptin, pepstatin, and bestatin had no effect on the ability of the conjugates to deliver the SIINFEKL epitope into the MHC class I presentation pathway in JAWSII cells. Lactacystin and MG-132 inhibited antigen presentation when the cells were treated with the EtxB-31-mer conjugate. In contrast, epitope presentation from the EtxB-19-mer peptide conjugate, in which the SIINFEKL epitope is located at the C terminus of the peptide was not inhibited by addition of proteasome inhibitors. The results are consistent with the proteasome generating the correct C terminus of the SIINFEKL epitope following peptide translocation into the cytoplasm.Table IEffect of protease inhibitors on EtxB-mediated epitope delivery The effects of leupeptin, pepstatin, bestatin, lactacystin, and MG-132 on antigen presentation from the EtxB-19-mer and EtxB-31-mer conjugates were determined in JAWSII cells. Cells were treated with inhibitor prior to incubation with EtxB conjugates and antigen presentation was measured by IL-2 release following incubation of JAWS II cells with RF33.70 T cells.
