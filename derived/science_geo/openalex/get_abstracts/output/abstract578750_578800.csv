https://openalex.org/W2488446542,"At the most fundamental level, the interaction between light and matter is manifested by the emission and absorption of single photons by single quantum emitters. Controlling light--matter interaction is the basis for diverse applications ranging from light technology to quantum--information processing. Many of these applications are nowadays based on photonic nanostructures strongly benefitting from their scalability and integrability. The confinement of light in such nanostructures imposes an inherent link between the local polarization and propagation direction of light. This leads to {\em chiral light--matter interaction}, i.e., the emission and absorption of photons depend on the propagation direction and local polarization of light as well as the polarization of the emitter transition. The burgeoning research field of {\em chiral quantum optics} offers fundamentally new functionalities and applications both for single emitters and ensembles thereof. For instance, a chiral light--matter interface enables the realization of integrated non--reciprocal single--photon devices and deterministic spin--photon interfaces. Moreover, engineering directional photonic reservoirs opens new avenues for constructing complex quantum circuits and networks, which may be applied to simulate a new class of quantum many--body systems."

Bian et al. studied young children to assess when those differential perceptions emerge. At age 5, children seemed not to differentiate between boys and girls in expectations of “really, really smart”—childhood's version of adult brilliance. But by age 6, girls were prepared to lump more boys into the “really, really smart” category and to steer themselves away from games intended for the “really, really smart.” Science , this issue p. 389"

Heirloom varieties, on the other hand, maintain the richer flavors and sweeter tomatoes of years past. Tieman et al. combined tasting panels with chemical and genomic analyses of nearly 400 varieties of tomatoes. They identified some of the flavorful components that have been lost over time. Identification of the genes that have also gone missing provides a path forward for reinstating flavor to commercially grown tomatoes. Science , this issue p. 391"
https://openalex.org/W2580635944,"Transition metal catalysis has traditionally relied on organometallic complexes that can cycle through a series of ground-state oxidation levels to achieve a series of discrete yet fundamental fragment-coupling steps. The viability of excited-state organometallic catalysis via direct photoexcitation has been demonstrated. Although the utility of triplet sensitization by energy transfer has long been known as a powerful activation mode in organic photochemistry, it is surprising to recognize that photosensitization mechanisms to access excited-state organometallic catalysts have lagged far behind. Here, we demonstrate excited-state organometallic catalysis via such an activation pathway: Energy transfer from an iridium sensitizer produces an excited-state nickel complex that couples aryl halides with carboxylic acids. Detailed mechanistic studies confirm the role of photosensitization via energy transfer."

Zhang et al. successfully prepared the pentazolate ion, a negatively charged ring of five nitrogens, by oxidative cleavage of a C–N bond in an aryl-substituted precursor (see the Perspective by Christe). The molecule was stabilized and isolated in the solid state as a hydrated ammonium chloride salt. Spectroscopic and crystallographic characterization confirmed the ring's planar geometry.

As a consequence, electrical conductivity and the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity are typically proportional to each other. Lee et al. found a large violation of this so-called Wiedemann-Franz law near the insulator-metal transition in VO 2 nanobeams. In the metallic phase, the electronic contribution to thermal conductivity was much smaller than what would be expected from the Wiedemann-Franz law. The results can be explained in terms of independent propagation of charge and heat in a strongly correlated system. Science , this issue p. 371"

This phenomenon has been attributed to antibody-dependent enhancement. Wang et al. show that a specific subclass of antibody, IgG1, which lacks fucosyl residues on the Fc segment of the heavy chain of the immunoglobulin, is elevated in patients with severe secondary dengue disease. These non-neutralizing antibodies bind activating Fc receptors and appear to cross-react with platelet antigens to cause platelet depletion, contributing to thrombocytopenia.

Asner et al. developed airborne instrumentation to make large-scale maps of forest functional diversity across 72 million hectares of the Peruvian Andes and Amazon basin (see the Perspective by Kapos). They generated a suite of forest canopy functional trait maps from laser-guided imaging spectroscopy and used them to define distinct forest functional classes. These were then compared with government deforestation and land allocation data, which enabled an analysis of conservation threats and opportunities across the region.

This profound insight has transformed our understanding of strongly interacting Fermi gases. Here, using Ramsey interferometry, we study coherent evolution of the resonantly interacting Bose gas, and show that it cannot be explained by only pairwise correlations. Our experiments reveal the crucial role of three-body correlations arising from Efimov physics, and provide a direct measurement of the associated three-body contact."

https://openalex.org/W2579897106,"Proteins responsible for Pi homeostasis are critical for all life. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, extracellular [Pi] is “sensed” by the inositol-hexakisphosphate kinase (IP6K) that synthesizes the intracellular inositol pyrophosphate 5-diphosphoinositol 1,2,3,4,6-pentakisphosphate (5-InsP7) as follows: during a period of Pi starvation, there is a decline in cellular [ATP]; the unusually low affinity of IP6Ks for ATP compels 5-InsP7 levels to fall in parallel (Azevedo, C., and Saiardi, A. (2017) Trends. Biochem. Sci. 42, 219–231. Hitherto, such Pi sensing has not been documented in metazoans. Here, using a human intestinal epithelial cell line (HCT116), we show that levels of both 5-InsP7 and ATP decrease upon [Pi] starvation and subsequently recover during Pi replenishment. However, a separate inositol pyrophosphate, 1,5-bisdiphosphoinositol 2,3,4,6-tetrakisphosphate (InsP8), reacts more dramatically (i.e. with a wider dynamic range and greater sensitivity). To understand this novel InsP8 response, we characterized kinetic properties of the bifunctional 5-InsP7 kinase/InsP8 phosphatase activities of full-length diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinases (PPIP5Ks). These data fulfil previously published criteria for any bifunctional kinase/phosphatase to exhibit concentration robustness, permitting levels of the kinase product (InsP8 in this case) to fluctuate independently of varying precursor (i.e. 5-InsP7) pool size. Moreover, we report that InsP8 phosphatase activities of PPIP5Ks are strongly inhibited by Pi (40–90% within the 0–1 mm range). For PPIP5K2, Pi sensing by InsP8 is amplified by a 2-fold activation of 5-InsP7 kinase activity by Pi within the 0–5 mm range. Overall, our data reveal mechanisms that can contribute to specificity in inositol pyrophosphate signaling, regulating InsP8 turnover independently of 5-InsP7, in response to fluctuations in extracellular supply of a key nutrient.

Yet important biological systems such as allosteric ligand-receptor binding, macromolecular crowding, or misfolded molecules may not follow this fundamental law and require a particular reaction model. Here we introduce a fluctuation theorem for ligand binding and an experimental approach using single-molecule force-spectroscopy to determine binding energies, selectivity and allostery of nucleic acids, proteins and peptides in a model-independent fashion. This work extends the use of fluctuation theorems beyond unimolecular folding reactions, bridging the thermodynamics of small systems and the basic laws of chemical equilibrium."

https://openalex.org/W2582543921,"Microtubule dynamics involves the polymerization and depolymerization of tubulin dimers and is an essential and highly regulated process required for cell viability, architecture, and division. The regulation of the microtubule network also depends on the maintenance of a pool of αβ-tubulin heterodimers. These dimers are the end result of complex folding and assembly events, requiring the TCP1 Ring Complex (TriC or CCT) chaperonin and five tubulin-specific chaperones, tubulin binding cofactors A-E (TBCA-TBCE). However, models of the actions of these chaperones are incomplete or inconsistent. We previously purified TBCD from bovine tissues and showed that it tightly binds the small GTPase ARL2 but appears to be inactive. Here, in an effort to identify the functional form of TBCD and using non-denaturing gels and immunoblotting, we analyzed lysates from a number of mouse tissues and cell lines to identify the quaternary state(s) of TBCD and ARL2. We found that both proteins co-migrated in native gels in a complex of ∼200 kDa that also contained β-tubulin. Using human embryonic kidney cells enabled the purification of the TBCD·ARL2·β-tubulin trimer found in cell and tissue lysates as well as two other novel TBCD complexes. Characterization of ARL2 point mutants that disrupt binding to TBCD suggested that the ARL2-TBCD interaction is critical for proper maintenance of microtubule densities in cells. We conclude that the TBCD·ARL2·β-tubulin trimer represents a functional complex whose activity is fundamental to microtubule dynamics."

Therefore, erythrophagocytosis is traditionally considered as one of the most important criteria to identify the pathogenic behavior of the amoebic trophozoites. Phagocytosis is an essential process for the proliferation and virulence of this parasite. Phagocytic cargo, upon internalization, follows a defined trafficking route to amoebic lysosomal degradation machinery. Here, we demonstrated the role of EhRab35 in the early and late phases of erythrophagocytosis by the amoeba. EhRab35 showed large vacuolar as well as punctate vesicular localization. The spatiotemporal dynamics of vacuolar EhRab35 and its exchange with soluble cytosolic pool were monitored by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments. Using extensive microscopy and biochemical methods, we demonstrated that upon incubation with RBCs EhRab35 is recruited to the site of phagocytic cups as well as to the nascent phagosomes that harbor Gal/GalNAc lectin and actin. Overexpression of a dominant negative mutant of EhRab35 reduced phagocytic cup formation and thereby reduced RBC internalization, suggesting a potential role of the Rab GTPase in the cup formation. Furthermore, we also performed a phagosomal maturation assay and observed that the activated form of EhRab35 significantly increased the rate of RBC degradation. Interestingly, this mutant also significantly enhanced the number of acidic compartments in the trophozoites. Taken together, our results suggest that EhRab35 is involved in the initial stage of phagocytosis as well as in the phagolysosomal biogenesis in E. histolytica and thus contributes to the pathogenicity of the parasite.

https://openalex.org/W2583064761,"Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathways are key determinants of cell fate in animals. Their basic mechanism of action is simple. However, to produce cell-specific responses, TGF-β pathways are heavily regulated by secondary factors, such as membrane-associated EGF-CFC family proteins. Cellular activities of EGF-CFC proteins have been described, but their molecular functions, including how the mammalian homologs Cripto-1 and Cryptic recognize and regulate TGF-β family ligands, are less clear. Here we use purified human Cripto-1 and mouse Cryptic produced in mammalian cells to show that these two EGF-CFC homologs have distinct, highly specific ligand binding activities. Cripto-1 interacts with BMP-4 in addition to its known partner Nodal, whereas Cryptic interacts only with Activin B. These interactions depend on the integrity of the protein, as truncated or deglycosylated Cripto-1 lacked BMP-4 binding activity. Significantly, Cripto-1 and Cryptic blocked binding of their cognate ligands to type I and type II TGF-β receptors, indicating that Cripto-1 and Cryptic contact ligands at their receptor interaction surfaces and, thus, that they could inhibit their ligands. Indeed, soluble Cripto-1 and Cryptic inhibited ligand signaling in various cell-based assays, including SMAD-mediated luciferase reporter gene expression, and differentiation of a multipotent stem cell line. But in agreement with previous work, the membrane bound form of Cripto-1 potentiated signaling, revealing a critical role of membrane association for its established cellular activity. Thus, our studies provide new insights into the mechanism of ligand recognition by this enigmatic family of membrane-anchored TGF-β family signaling regulators and link membrane association with their signal potentiating activities."

https://openalex.org/W2582549635,"A long-smoldering feud over the existence of mysterious dark matter is heating up. For decades, a few scientists have argued that dark matter—the stuff thought to make up 85% of the matter in the universe—cannot explain a universal pattern in the motions of spiral galaxies such as our own Milky Way but that a theory called modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) can. Now, a leading theorist argues that dark matter can explain this pattern after all. Since the 1970s, astronomers have known that the outer stars spiral galaxies circulate faster than they could if the gravity from the visible matter in the galaxy alone were pulling on them, suggesting that some unseen dark matter provides the extra gravity needed to hold them in. But in 1983 one theorist proposed instead tweaking Newton9s famous second law of motion, which says an object accelerates in proportion to the force on it. MOND9s fix would explain why the out stars can circulate so fast. It explains why a galaxy9s behavior can be predicted from the distribution of ordinary matter in it alone. But now a team of theorists say that dark matter can also explain that striking phenomena. The key, they say, is the density of the dark matter halos in which galaxies form and a certain gravitational interplay between dark and ordinary matter. If correct, the argument could knock the pegs out from under MOND."

It is now possible to manipulate the phase and amplitude of propagating light with carefully designed subwavelength features patterned into thin layers of metal and dielectric films. These metasurfaces offer the possibility to control light with optical devices that are orders of magnitude smaller than the familiar bulk optical components of lenses and mirrors. Using a specially prepared silicon-based grating structure covered with indium tin oxide (a commonly used transparent conducting oxide), Kim and Brongersma showed that gating the structure with applied voltage can reversibly change the surface from nearly transparent to reflective. Being able to electrically switch the properties of the metasurface provides additional functionality for developing active nanophotonic devices based on a flat optics platform.

Cytokinesis, the final stage of cell division, requires the assembly and constriction of an actomyosin contractile ring. Silva et al. combined laser microsurgery with live imaging in the Caenorhabditis elegans early embryo. They used the laser to introduce gaps into the constricting contractile ring of the worm's cells very precisely. The contractile rings were able to repair gaps in their structure so that cytokinesis always completed successfully. Once gaps were repaired, the rings transiently constricted more rapidly, allowing the cell to complete cytokinesis within the normal schedule. Unexpectedly, a continuous actomyosin ring structure was not required for constriction; an open ring was able to constrict and could recover from successive cuts. —

https://openalex.org/W2582767755,"Tensions between a graduate student and a prominent biomedical researcher at Harvard University have produced a series of extraordinary events, including an involuntary psychiatric evaluation of the student and a court order against the scientist ordering him to stay 30.5 meters away from the student and have no contact. The student says the forced evaluation occurred because he had filed a scientific misconduct complaint against the researcher, and that it constituted retaliation. A state judge agreed. But the researcher says he acted only out of concern for the student's welfare, and is seeking to have the order overturned. All sides say the order has created tense and difficult working conditions. And the dispute has left bystanders wondering how a conflict between a mentor and his student spiraled so dramatically out of control, jeopardizing the reputation of a prominent scientist and an elite research university, along with the future of a promising young scientist."
https://openalex.org/W2582847384,"U.S. biomedical researchers have fought off a feared rule change that would have made it more difficult and expensive to study anonymous blood and tissue samples taken from patients. Proposed in 2015, the controversial change was dropped 2 days before former President Barack Obama left office, when federal officials released a long-awaited update to the so-called Common Rule that protects human participants in studies. The update also hands scientists a second victory, by blunting a 2014 law that researchers say had hamstrung studies using blood spots obtained from newborns. The 543-page rule, released 18 January, does include other changes, including lighter ethics reviews for certain studies, that scientists welcome."
