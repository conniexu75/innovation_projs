https://openalex.org/W2094474445,"The contributions of two subclasses of excitatory amino acid transmitter receptors to the induction and expression of long-term potentiation (LTP) were analyzed in hippocampal slices. The quisqualate/kainate receptor antagonist DNQX (6,7-dinitro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione) blocked 85% of the evoked field potential, leaving a small response that was sensitive to D-AP5 (D-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate), an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker. This residual D-AP5-sensitive response was of comparable size in control and previously potentiated inputs. High-frequency stimulation in the presence of DNQX did not result in the development of robust LTP. Washout of the drug, however, revealed the potentiation effect. Thus NMDA-mediated responses can induce, but are not greatly affected by, LTP; non-NMDA receptors, conversely, mediate responses that are not needed to elicit LTP but that are required for its expression."
https://openalex.org/W2044858838,"Two different monoclonal antibodies to the Thy-1 antigen, T11D7 and 2G12, were used to purify and characterize retinal ganglion cells from postnatal rat retina. Although Thy-1 has been reported to be a specific marker for ganglion cells in retina, retinal cell suspensions contained several other types of Thy-1-positive cells as well. Nevertheless, a simple two-step ""panning"" procedure allowed isolation of ganglion cells to nearly 100% purity. We found that postnatal ganglion cells differed in antigenic, morphological, and intrinsic electrophysiological characteristics, and that these properties were correlated with one another. Minor variations of this panning protocol should allow rapid, high yield purification to homogeneity of many other neuronal and glial cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2157365188,"Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a long-lasting enhancement of synaptic transmission that can be induced by brief repetitive stimulation of excitatory pathways in the hippocampus. One of the most controversial points is whether the process underlying the enhanced synaptic transmission occurs pre- or postsynaptically. To examine this question, we have taken advantage of the novel physiological properties of excitatory synaptic transmission in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Synaptically released glutamate activates both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors on pyramidal cells, resulting in an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) with two distinct components. A selective increase in the non-NMDA component of the EPSP was observed with LTP. This result suggests that the enhancement of synaptic transmission during LTP is caused by an increased sensitivity of the postsynaptic neuron to synaptically released glutamate."
https://openalex.org/W2008630922,"A system in which immune-deficient mice are repopulated with cells from the human myeloid lineage, and that provides an in vivo stem cell assay for human hematopoietic cells is described. Generation of the chimeric human/immune-deficient (HID) mice was dependent on the use of immune-deficient bg/nu/xid mice. Infusion of these mice with human bone marrow gave rise to increases in human macrophage progenitors during more than 5 weeks of in vivo growth, indicating the seeding, proliferation, and differentiation of human stem cells. The human identity of the progenitors was confirmed by sequence analysis and their dependence on human growth factors. The creation of HID mice lays the foundation for establishing animal models for a wide variety of human hemopathies, from leukemia to infectious disease."
https://openalex.org/W1705232837,"The 5'-end of the human transforming growth factor-beta 1 gene (TGF-beta 1) was isolated from a human leukocyte genomic DNA library. Analysis of the transcriptional start sites of human TGF-beta 1 mRNAs by S1 mapping and primer extension revealed two major start sites 271 nucleotides from one another; several minor sites were also identified. DNA sequence analysis showed that the promoter region contains neither a TATA box nor a CAAT box, is very G+C rich, and contains 11 CCGCCC repeats. Seven putative binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 were also identified. To determine the location of sites that may be important for the function of the TGF-beta 1 promoter, we joined the 5'-end of the TGF-beta 1 gene to the coding region for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. The chimeric gene produced high levels of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity in transfected HT-1080, AKR-2B, and A-549 cells. Sequences responsible for both promotion and inhibition of transcription were located in the region extending from 1400 to 300 base pairs upstream of the first major TGF-beta 1 transcriptional start site. The 130-base pair fragment located between 453 and 323 base pairs upstream of this start site contains positive regulatory activity in all cells tested. A second promoter activity was identified in the region between the two major transcriptional start sites. These findings revealed a complex pattern of regulation of human TGF-beta 1 gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1978677685,"An alternate form of the Alzheimer amyloid protein precursor mRNA that encodes a protease inhibitor domain has recently been reported. Oligonucleotide probes that differentiate between the two mRNAs are used to describe the expression of each amyloid precursor transcript in the human brain. RNA blot analyses show that one of the mRNAs is expressed selectively in the nervous system, that the two messages display different regional distributions in the adult human brain, and that the expression of the two mRNAs is differentially affected in Down's syndrome brain and in Alzheimer's disease frontal cortex. In situ hybridization shows that the two transcripts display the same laminar distribution in the adult cortex but that the transcripts differ significantly in their levels of expression in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W1575840121,"Abstract Vasoconstrictors such as angiotensin II (Ang II) play an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. These agonists may be responsible for the abnormal vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth seen in hypertension, either indirectly as a consequence of elevating blood pressure or directly as a result of receptor-mediated effects on VSMC growth. To investigate whether Ang II might directly initiate or modulate some of the early genetic programs associated with growth in VSMC, the expression of the proto-oncogene c-fos was studied in cultured rat aortic VSMC. Ang II rapidly induced the accumulation of c-fos mRNA, with maximal levels occurring at approximately 30 min. Induction of c-fos mRNA by Ang II was concentration-dependent, with a maximal response at 100 nM. Ang II induction of c-fos mRNA was blocked by its competitive inhibitor, [sarcosine 1,isoleucine 8]angiotensin II. Induction of c-fos mRNA was not dependent upon Ang II-stimulated intracellular alkalinization or activation of Na+/H+ exchange, but was dependent upon mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and protein kinase C activation. Epidermal growth factor, a VSMC mitogen, also induced c-fos mRNA in VSMC, but by a mechanism different from that of Ang II. These results demonstrate that the vasoconstrictor hormone Ang II induces in VSMC one of the earliest genes, c-fos, associated with the proliferative response."

https://openalex.org/W1538643202,"5,10-Dideazatetrahydrofolate (DDATHF) is a new antimetabolite designed as an inhibitor of folate metabolism at sites other than dihydrofolate reductase. DDATHF was found to inhibit the growth of L1210 and CCRF-CEM cells in culture at concentrations in the range of 10-30 nM. The inhibitory effect of DDATHF on the growth of L1210 and CCRF-CEM cells was reversed by either hypoxanthine or aminoimidazole carboxamide. Growth inhibition by DDATHF was prevented by addition of both thymidine and hypoxanthine, but not by thymidine alone. 5-Formyltetrahydrofolate reversed the effects of DDATHF in a dose-dependent manner. DDATHF had no appreciable inhibitory activity against either dihydrofolate reductase or thymidylate synthase in vitro, but was found to be an excellent substrate for folylpolyglutamate synthetase. DDATHF had little or no effect on incorporation of either deoxyuridine or thymidine into DNA, in distinct contrast to the effects of the classical dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, methotrexate. DDATHF was found to deplete cellular ATP and GTP over the same concentrations as those inhibitory to leukemic cell growth, suggesting that the locus of DDATHF action was in the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. The synthesis of formylglycinamide ribonucleotide in intact L1210 cells was inhibited by DDATHF with the same concentration dependence as inhibition of growth. This suggested that DDATHF inhibited glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase, the first folate-dependent enzyme of de novo purine synthesis. DDATHF is a potent folate analog which suppresses purine synthesis through direct or indirect inhibition of glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase."

In vitro-defined binding sites act as ftz-dependent enhancers in cultured cells. Another homoeodomain-containing protein, the engrailed gene product, competes for homoeodomain-binding sites and counteracts ftz activation."
https://openalex.org/W1480698319,"The binding of fibrinogen to its platelet receptor, the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa complex, is mediated, in part, by an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence within the fibrinogen A alpha chain. PAC1 is an IgM-kappa murine monoclonal antibody that binds to the platelet fibrinogen receptor, and its binding is inhibited by both fibrinogen and RGD-containing peptides. To identify the regions of PAC1 that interact with the fibrinogen receptor, we determined the mRNA sequences of PAC1 immunoglobulin heavy and light chain variable regions. Five out of the six complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of PAC1 had entirely germline sequences with no regions of similarity to fibrinogen. However, CDR3 of the PAC1 heavy chain (H-CDR3) was very large and unique due to the insertion of a novel D region segment. H-CDR3 contained a sequence, Arg-Tyr-Asp (RYD), that, if present in the proper conformation, might behave like the RGD sequence in fibrinogen. A 21-residue synthetic peptide encompassing the H-CDR3 region inhibited fibrinogen-dependent platelet aggregation as well as the binding of PAC1 (Ki = 10 microM) and fibrinogen (Ki = 5 microM) to activated platelets. The RYD region of H-CDR3 appeared to be central to its function, because substitution of the tyrosine with glycine increased the inhibitory potency of the peptide by 10-fold, while replacing the tyrosine with D-alanine or inverting the RYD sequence sharply reduced the inhibitory potency. Thus, the linear sequence, RYD, within H-CDR3 of PAC1 appears to mimic the RGD receptor recognition sequence in fibrinogen. This type of immunologic approach could be useful in studying the structural basis of other receptor-ligand interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1594779960,"A novel protein with mitogenic activity in vitro and immunomodulating activity in vivo has been isolated from the mycelial extract of an Oriental medicinal fungus, Ling Zhi (Ganoderma lucidium). This protein was named Ling Zhi-8 (LZ-8) and its biochemical and immunological properties are described. LZ-8 was purified by two chromatographic systems, gel filtration and followed by ion-exchange, using an in vitro bioassay measuring blast-formation stimulatory activity toward mouse spleen lymphocytes to monitor purification. Analysis by several types of electrophoresis revealed a single band, with the molecular weight differing slightly depending on the system employed. Under reduced conditions, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using the method of Laemmli, U. K. ((1970) Nature 227, 680–685) indicated an apparent Mr = 17,100, while under nonreduced conditions an apparent Mr = 17,500 was found; and, using Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a value of apparent Mr = 13,100 was obtained. LZ-8 has an isoelectric point of 4.4, and sugar analysis indicated a low carbohydrate content (1.3%). Half-cysteine, histidine, and methionine were not detected from the analysis of amino acid composition after further purification of LZ-8 by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. LZ-8 was capable of hemagglutinating sheep red blood cells, but no such activity was observed toward human red blood cells (A, B, AB, and O types). In vivo, LZ-8 prevents the production of systemic anaphylaxis reaction in mice if it has been administered repeatedly, and reduction of antibody production is the suggested mechanism. The mechanisms of hemagglutination of sheep red blood cells and of blast-formation stimulation of mouse spleen cells are also discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1997480068,"A coculture system consisting of input axons from entorhinal cortex explants and target hippocampal pyramidal neurons was used to demonstrate that glutamate, released spontaneously from afferent axons, can influence both dendritic geometry of target neurons and formation of presumptive synaptic sites. Dendritic outgrowth was reduced in hippocampal neurons growing on entorhinal axons when compared with neurons growing off the axons. Presumptive presynaptic sites were observed in association with hippocampal neuron dendrites and somas. HPLC analysis showed that glutamate was released from the explants in an activity- and Ca2(+)-dependent manner. The general glutamate receptor antagonist D-glutamylglycine significantly increased dendritic outgrowth in pyramidal neurons associated with entorhinal axons and reduced presumptive presynaptic sites. Tetrodotoxin and reduction of extracellular Ca2+ also promoted dendritic outgrowth and reduced the formation of presumptive synaptic sites. The results suggest that the neurotransmitter glutamate may play important roles in the development of hippocampal circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W1540400224,"We have extensively characterized the sequences of the rat growth hormone (rGH) promoter required for induction by T3 (thyroid hormone, 3,5,3'-L-triiodothyronine) in a transient transfection system. Oligonucleotides containing portions of the rGH promoter sequence with various deletions and point mutations were placed upstream of the first 137 base pairs of the rGH promoter or the heterologous herpes virus thymidine kinase promoter in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression vectors. The rGH137 and thymidine kinase promoters show no or minimal response to T3 in the basal state. The constructs were tested in GH4C1 rat pituitary cells and COS cells (functionally deficient in thyroid hormone receptor) with and without a co-transfected plasmid expressing a beta type c-erbA gene coding for a functional T3 receptor. Oligonucleotides containing the T3 receptor binding site confer hormone-dependent induction in a manner that is independent of either orientation or variation in position on the helix relative to the promoter. Point mutations in the sequence -189 to -173 result in loss of T3 induction, and bases between -173 and -167 were also required for a full T3 response. The minimal length to confer T3 induction to the rGH promoter was 23 base pairs (-190 to -167). Point mutations creating a perfect duplication of 7 base pairs within the receptor binding site conferred 12-fold T3 response to the rGH137 promoter, 3-fold greater than the wild type rGH237 construct. T3 inductibility was also transferred to the thymidine kinase promoter by an oligonucleotide containing the sequence -200 to -157, demonstrating that cell type specific elements located 3' to 157 of the rGH promoter are not required for thyroid hormone responsiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2152778316,"The homeotic gene Ultrabithorax (Ubx), located in the bithorax complex of Drosophila, encodes a family of closely related proteins that direct the developmental fates of posterior thoracic and anterior abdominal metameres. We have purified a member of the Ubx protein family from an overproducing E. coli strain and have shown that it is sequence-specific DNA binding protein. The protein binds tightly to sequences near its own promoter and near the P1 promoter of Antenna-pedia (Antp), a homeotic gene Ubx is known to repress from genetic studies. The binding sites occur in clusters downstream of the transcription start sites, and far upstream at Antp P1. They range in size from 40 to 90 bp, and contain tandem repeats of the trinucleotide TAA or the related hexanucleotide TAA-TCG. These results suggest that the regulatory activities of Ubx are direct and are mediated by binding of Ubx proteins to promoter region sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1493380618,"Abstract A monoclonal antibody (mAb 10A8), derived from mice immunized with fractions of the Golgi apparatus from rat brain neurons, was exploited to isolate and partially characterize a novel glycoprotein of 160 kDa apparent molecular mass which was localized by immunoelectron microscopy in medial cisternae of the Golgi apparatus of neurons, glia, pituitary cells, and rat pheochromocytoma (PC 12). The yield of immunoaffinity purified protein was 0.9 microgram/g of rat brain and represented 3% of the Golgi protein; the protein contained asparagine-linked carbohydrates and sialic acid and N-acetylglucosamine residues; unreduced protein had a greater electrophoretic mobility (130 kDa) consistent with the presence of intrachain disulfide bonds. The bulk of the glycoprotein resided within the membrane and/or luminal face of the Golgi cisternae. After extraction with Triton X-114, the glycoprotein was found in both aqueous and detergent phases. The monoclonal antibody did not inhibit the activities of Golgi enzymes or the uptake of nucleotide sugars by intact Golgi vesicles. The findings indicate that the 160-kDa glycoprotein is a specific constituent of medial Golgi cisternae. The results of this study lend support to the hypothesis that the distributions of glycosyltransferases in the Golgi apparatus are cell specific, since in neurons this sialic acid containing glycoprotein is found in medial rather than in trans and/or in the trans Golgi reticulum cisternae, where sialyltransferases have been localized in other cells. Alternatively, resident neuronal Golgi sialoglycoproteins may acquire sialic acid in trans elements of the apparatus and then shuttle back in medial cisternae."
https://openalex.org/W1648025923,"Abstract Rat liver glucokinase (ATP:D-hexose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.1) was purified to homogeneity, cleaved, and subjected to amino acid sequence analysis. Forty-five percent of the protein sequence was obtained, and this information was used to design oligonucleotide probes to screen a rat liver cDNA library. A 1601-base pair cDNA (GK1) contained an open reading frame that encoded the amino acid sequences found in the peptides used to generate the oligonucleotide probes. A second cDNA was subsequently identified (GK.Z2), which is 2346 base pairs long and corresponds to nearly the entire glucokinase mRNA. Blot transfer analysis of hepatic RNA showed that glucokinase mRNA exists as a single species of about 2400 nucleotides. Four hours of insulin treatment of diabetic rats resulted in a 30-fold induction of this mRNA. GK.Z2 has a long open reading frame which, with the known partial peptide sequence, allowed us to deduce the primary structure of glucokinase. The enzyme is composed of 465 amino acids and has a mass of 51,924 daltons. Glucokinase has 53 and 33% amino acid sequence identities with the carboxyl-terminal domains of rat brain hexokinase I and yeast hexokinase, respectively. If conservative amino acid replacements are also considered, glucokinase is similar to these two enzymes at 75 and 63% of positions, respectively. The putative glucose- and ATP-binding domains of glucokinase were identified, and these regions appear to be highly conserved in the hexokinase family of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1599972275,"Abstract Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors were purified from rat forebrain and labeled with [3H]N-(2-chloroethyl)N-(2',3'-[3H2]propyl)-2-aminoethylbenzilate. Cleavage of the labeled muscarinic acetylcholine receptors with a lysine-specific protease yielded labeled, glycosylated peptides about 130 and 200 residues in length, which came from different receptor sequences. The probable cleavage sites are in the second intracellular loop and in the second extracellular or third intracellular loop. The N-terminal 130 residues are disulfide-bonded to another part of the receptor structure, supporting the presence of a link between the second and third extracellular loops. The [3H]propylbenzilylcholine mustard-receptor link is cleaved by nucleophiles, acids, and bases under denaturing conditions, suggesting modification of an acidic residue. Cyanogen bromide cleavage points to transmembrane helix 3 as the site of label attachment."
https://openalex.org/W1577528912,"Abstract Caldesmon is known to bind to smooth muscle myosin. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of caldesmon completely blocks its interaction with myosin. Cleavage of caldesmon at its 2 cysteine residues by 2-nitro-5-thiocyanobenzoic acid (NTCB) occurs initially at one site to yield 108-kDa and 21.2-kDa peptides and subsequently at the second site within the 108-kDa peptide to yield 85-kDa and 23.5-kDa fragments. The 23.5-kDa peptide retains the ability to bind to myosin. The N-terminal (95 kDa) and C-terminal (42 kDa) chymotryptic peptides of caldesmon were isolated and digested with NTCB: the C-terminal actin- and calmodulin-binding peptide was not cleaved, indicating that it does not contain either of the cysteine residues, whereas the 95-kDa N-terminal peptide was cleaved at two sites to yield 56-kDa, 23.5-kDa, and 21.2-kDa fragments. The arrangement of NTCB fragments in caldesmon is, therefore: 21.2 kDa/23.5 kDa/85 kDa from N to C terminus. Digestion of phosphorylated caldesmon with NTCB suggested a single phosphorylation site in the 21.2-kDa peptide and three sites in the 23.5-kDa peptide. These results lead to the development of a model whereby caldesmon may cross-link actin to myosin and such cross-linking is blocked by phosphorylation of caldesmon. This mechanism may explain the formation of reversible latch bridges which permit force maintenance at low levels of myosin phosphorylation in intact smooth muscles."
https://openalex.org/W1821651100,"Bradykinin-evoked rises in [Ca2+]i were measured in fura-2-loaded bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cell monolayers by dual wavelength excitation fluorimetry. In monolayers seeded thinly and grown to confluence, bradykinin, in the presence of external Ca2+, evoked a rise in [Ca2+]i composed of an initial peak and subsequent oscillating plateau. In the absence of external Ca2+, bradykinin evoked a rise in [Ca2+]i which then returned to the basal value without oscillating. In monolayers seeded near confluent density, the bradykinin-evoked peak in [Ca2+]i was followed by a steady plateau which showed no oscillation. The addition of the phorbol ester, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, to a monolayer during bradykinin-evoked oscillations abolished the oscillations and lowered [Ca2+]i partway back toward the basal level. The addition of the protein kinase C inhibitor, H7, did not abolish oscillatory activity, although the frequency of oscillation was reduced. These results indicate that synchronized oscillatory activity can occur in endothelial cell monolayers. It is suggested that these oscillations are dependent on intercellular coupling developed when the cells are grown to confluence and that the mechanism responsible for generating oscillations in [Ca2+]i requires extracellular Ca2+ and involves protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W1574788707,"Abstract Glycoprotein IIIb (also known as glycoprotein IV) is a major glycoprotein present on the surface of human platelets. Recent studies suggest that glycoprotein IIIb may be a receptor site for thrombospondin. Thrombospondin, a multifunctional adhesive glycoprotein released from stimulated platelets, plays an important role in the stabilization of platelet aggregates. In this study, a new method for the purification of glycoprotein IIIb is described. Glycoprotein IIIb was isolated from Triton X-114 platelet membrane extracts, under nondenaturing conditions, by tandem anion-exchange and size exclusion fast protein liquid chromatography. The purified glycoprotein had the same apparent molecular mass (88 kDa) under nonreducing or reducing conditions. The tryptic peptide map of the purified protein was identical to that of bona fide glycoprotein IIIb as isolated from two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels of platelet membrane proteins. In addition, the purified glycoprotein was recognized by an anti-GPIIIb monoclonal antibody (OKM5). The purified glycoprotein specifically bound to thrombospondin in the presence of calcium. Monospecific anti-GPIIIb antibodies interfered with the expression of endogenous thrombospondin on thrombin-activated platelets and partially inhibited collagen- and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation without a significant effect on platelet secretion. Glycoprotein IIIb, by interacting with thrombospondin on the activated platelet surface, may play an important role in the platelet aggregation process."
https://openalex.org/W1577381787,"We have purified to homogeneity and analyzed the amino acid composition of a small (Mr 14,000), basic (pi 9.0) protein from human plasma. This has been named acylation stimulating protein (ASP) because it markedly stimulates triacylglycerol synthesis in human adipocytes. As well, it stimulates triacylglycerol synthesis in human skin fibroblasts cultured from normal individuals. Characteristic saturation curves for the cell metabolic responses to ASP were observed in both cell types with higher stimulation of oleate incorporation into triacylglycerol being observed in adipocytes. The stimulation of triacylglycerol synthesis was much greater with ASP than with insulin. Neither fatty acid binding protein nor albumin was able to mimic the ASP effect."

https://openalex.org/W2060594563,"The spatially restricted expression of mammalian homeobox genes in teh embryonic central nervous system (CNS) provides an opportunity to study the basis of spatial gene regulation in mammalian development. Here, we define a regulatory region of the murine Hox 1.3 gene that mediates such a region-specific expression pattern. The Hox 1.3 gene contains two exons, encodes a putative protein of 270 amino acids, and is expressed preferentially in the spinal cord at midgestation. We have analyzed transgenic mice containing various Hox 1.3 DNA fragments fused to reporter sequences, such as a human growth hormone gene fragment or the E. coli lacZ structural gene. As shown by RNAase protection assays or by in situ analyses of beta-galactosidase activity, several hybrid genes are expressed in the embryonic central nervous system in a spatially restricted manner, along both the rostrocaudal and dorsoventral axes. A 912 nucleotide sequence located immediately upstream of the Hox 1.3 coding sequence is sufficient to direct expression to the dorsolateral cells of the brachial spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W2060568362,"The expression of the homeodomain protein XIHbox 1 in developing Xenopus limbs was analyzed using specific antibodies. In the forelimb bud mesoderm XIHbox 1 shows a clear antero-posterior gradient that is strongest in the anterior and proximal region of the forelimb. Hindlimb bud mesoderm is devoid of XIHbox 1, indicating an early molecular difference between arm and leg. The innermost ectodermal cell layer is positive throughout the forelimb and hindlimb bud ectoderm, but no other areas of the skin. Similar results are obtained in developing mouse limbs, suggesting that XIHbox 1 participates in forelimb development in a variety of tetrapods. In early tadpoles analyzed at stages preceding limb bud formation, the lateral plate mesoderm is positive in the region corresponding to the earliest “field” of forelimb information, but not in the hindlimb field. These results suggest a molecular link between morphogenetic fields, gradients, and homeobox genes in vertebrate development."
https://openalex.org/W1554357667,"The structure of a blue copper protein, cupredoxin, from the potent denitrifying bacterium Alcaligenes faecalis S-6, has been determined and refined against 2 A x-ray diffraction data. The agreement between observed and calculated structure factors is 0.159, and estimated errors in coordinates are 0.09-0.15 A. The protein folds in a beta sandwich similar to plastocyanin and azurin and includes features such as a kink and a tyrosine which have been noted previously for these proteins as well as immunoglobulins. The copper is bound by four ligands, in a distorted tetrahedral arrangement, with Cu-S gamma = 2.07 A (Cys-78), Cu-N delta 1 = 2.10 and 2.21 for His-40 and His-81, and Cu-S delta = 2.69 A (Met-86). Two of the ligands are further oriented by hydrogen bonds either to other side chains (Asn-9 to His-40), backbone atoms (NH...S) or a water molecule (to His-40). The methionine ligand has no extra constraints. The C-terminal loop containing three of the ligands is hydrogen-bonded to the strand containing His-40 by hydrogen bonds between the conserved residues Thr-79 and Asn-41. The pronounced dichroism of the crystal is a result of the orientation of the normal to the C beta-S gamma-Cu plane parallel to the crystallographic 6-fold axis."
https://openalex.org/W1507489898,"A lectin in the fruiting bodies of Psathyrella velutina was purified by affinity chromatography on a chitin column and subsequent ion-exchange chromatography. P. velutina lectin (PVL) tends to aggregate irreversibly in buffered saline, but the addition of glycerol (10%, v/v) to lectin solutions was found to prevent aggregate formation. PVL is assumed to occur as a monomer of a polypeptide of Mr = 40,000 as determined by gel filtration and by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. PVL is specific for N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). It was determined by equilibrium dialysis to have four binding sites/polypeptide molecule showing an average intrinsic association constant of K0 = 6.4 x 10(3) M-1 toward this sugar. The binding specificity of the lectin was studied by hemagglutination inhibition assays and by avidin-biotin-mediated enzyme immunoassays using various GlcNAc-containing saccharides. The results indicate that methyl N-acetyl beta-glucosaminide was a slightly better inhibitor than the corresponding alpha-anomer. PVL binds well to oligosaccharides bearing nonreducing terminal beta-GlcNAc linked 1----6 or 1----3 but poorly to those having a 1----4 linkage, such as N-acetylated chito-oligosaccharides. It also binds to the subterminal GlcNAc moiety when it is substituted at the C-6 position but does not interact with the moiety when substituted either at C-3 or C-4. Thus, these results show that PVL is quite different in its binding specificity from other GlcNAc-binding lectins of higher plants since they bind preferentially to beta-GlcNAc in 1----4 linkage and they have a high affinity for chitin oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1982131103,"Homozygous inheritance of the Z-type mutant form of the α1-antitrypsin (α1AT) gene results in the most common form of α1AT deficiency, a human hereditary disease associated with a high risk for the development of emphysema and an increased incidence of neonatal hepatitis. The α1AT-synthesizing cells of individuals with the Z gene have normal α1AT messenger RNA levels, but α1AT secretion is markedly reduced secondary to accumulation of newly synthesized α1AT in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. Crystallographic analysis of α1AT predicts that in normal α1AT, a negatively charged Glu342 is adjacent to positively charged Lys290. Thus the Glu342 → Lys342 Z mutation causes the loss of a normal salt bridge, resulting in the intracellular aggregation of the Z molecule. The prediction was made that a second mutation in the α1AT gene that changed the positively charged Lys290 to a negatively charged Glu290 would correct the secretion defect. When the second mutation was added to the Z-type complementary DNA, the resulting gene directed the synthesis and secretion of amounts of α1AT similar to that directed by the normal α1AT complementary DNA in an in vitro eukaryotic expression system. This suggests the possibility that a human hereditary disease can be corrected by inserting an additional mutation in the same gene."
https://openalex.org/W1587550412,"Abstract Etiolated Avena seedlings grown in the presence of 4-amino-5-hexynoic acid, an inhibitor of 5-aminolevulinic acid synthesis in plants, contain less than 10% of the spectrally detectable levels of phytochrome found in untreated seedlings (Elich, T.D., and Lagarias, J.C. (1988) Plant Physiol. 88, 747-751). In this study, incubation of explants from such seedlings with [14C]biliverdin IX alpha led to rapid covalent incorporation of radiolabel into a single 124-kDa polypeptide in soluble protein extracts. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that this protein was phytochrome. Parallel experiments were performed with four unlabeled linear tetrapyrroles, the naturally occurring biliverdin IX alpha isomer, two non-natural isomers, biliverdin XIII alpha and biliverdin III alpha, and phycocyanobilin-the cleaved prosthetic group of the light-harvesting antenna protein C-phycocyanin. In all cases, except for the III alpha isomer of biliverdin, a time-dependent recovery of photoreversible phytochrome was observed. The newly formed phytochrome obtained after incubation with biliverdin IX alpha exhibited spectral characteristics identical with those of the native protein. In contrast, the spectral properties of phytochromes formed during incubation with biliverdin XIII alpha and phycocyanobilin differed significantly from those of the native chromoprotein. These results indicate that biliverdin IX alpha is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the phytochrome chromophore and that phytochromes with prosthetic groups derived from bilatrienes having non-natural D-ring substituents are photochromic."
https://openalex.org/W1503985608,"Abstract Regulation of gonadotropin gene expression by sex steroids may occur via direct effects on the pituitary and/or by indirect effects of steroid on the hypothalamus. To study direct estrogen regulation of the rat luteinizing hormone beta (LH beta) gene, we performed estrogen receptor-DNA binding studies and transient expression gene transfer experiments. Nitrocellulose filter binding studies were performed with purified estrogen receptor from calf uterus and labeled fragments of the LH beta gene. Dose-dependent specific binding to receptor occurred only with LH beta gene fragments containing a common 284-base region from -1388 to -1105 bases upstream from the transcriptional start site. This DNA region contained a 15-base imperfect palindromic region (GGACACCATCTGTCC) with sequence similarity to other estrogen-responsive elements. Biological function was tested by inserting portions of the 5'-flanking region of the gene next to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter fused to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (LH beta-tkCAT) and performing gene transfer experiments with the pituitary GH3 cell line. Promoter activity in LH beta-tkCAT constructs containing LH beta gene sequences from bases -2013 to -613, or from bases -1388 to -613 in either orientation, exhibited stimulation with 17 beta-estradiol (E2) treatment; in contrast, constructs containing bases -885 to -613 were not regulated by E2. Positive regulation by E2 exhibited dose- and time-dependent stimulation, with a maximum 2- to 6-fold effect achieved after 48 h of treatment with 10(-8) M E2. The estrogen receptor appeared to be required for this biological response. Stimulation of LH beta-tkCAT constructs did not occur in L cells with undetectable levels of E2 receptor, but did occur after cotransfection of an LH beta-tkCAT construct and an expression vector containing the human estrogen receptor cDNA. These studies demonstrate that a 5'-flanking region of the rat LH beta gene can bind to the estrogen receptor and that this region can confer hormonal responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. Thus, positive steroid regulation of luteinizing hormone may occur directly on the pituitary at the level of the LH beta gene."
https://openalex.org/W1584905766,"Abstract CR39 is a cholesterol-repressible rat liver cDNA previously isolated by differential hybridization (Clarke, C.F., Tanaka, R.D., Svenson, K., Wamsley, M., Fogelman, A.M., and Edwards, P.A. (1987) Mol. Cell. Biol. 7, 3138-3146). To precisely identify the function of CR39 a fusion protein was constructed that contained the amino-terminal region of the bacterial protein anthranilate synthetase fused to the full length CR39 polypeptide. Affinity purified antisera directed against the fusion protein inactivated rat liver cytosolic prenyltransferase activity in vitro. In addition, affinity purified antisera made to purified chicken prenyltransferase cross-reacted with the fusion protein containing CR39. Rat hepatic prenyltransferase activity and enzyme mass were quantitated in animals fed diets or drugs known to alter endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis. Rats fed a diet supplemented with cholestyramine and mevinolin showed a 3.5-fold increase in activity and a 5.0-fold increase in mass of cytosolic prenyltransferase. A diet supplemented with cholesterol resulted in approximately a 4.0-fold decrease in hepatic enzyme activity and a 10-fold decrease in enzyme mass. Under these same dietary regimens the mass of prenyltransferase in the testes remained unchanged. We conclude that CR39 encodes the prenyltransferase of cholesterol biosynthesis, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase. Furthermore, in the liver this enzyme shows coordinate regulation with two other enzymes, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase, in response to cholesterol feeding and hypocholesterolemic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1602150092,"Abstract Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase from the cytosol of rat liver has 13 cysteines, at least one of which is known to be very reactive and essential for catalytic activity (Carlson, G. M., Colombo, G., and Lardy, H. A. (1978) Biochemistry 17, 5329-5338). In order to identify the essential cysteine, this enzyme was modified with the fluorescent sulfhydryl reagent N-(7-dimethylamino-4-methyl-3-coumarinyl)maleimide. Incubation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase with a 10% molar excess of this maleimide at 0 degrees C results in the rapid and nearly complete loss of catalytic activity. Under these conditions, 1 mol of the maleimide is incorporated per mol inactivated enzyme. The substrate GDP provides almost complete protection against inactivation and modification, while phosphoenolpyruvate protects against the rate, but not the extent, of modification. The pH dependence of the rate of enzyme inactivation suggests that the modified residue has a pK alpha of approximately 7.0. Purification and sequencing of the labeled peptide identifies the hyperreactive essential cysteine as Cys-288. This cysteine lies between two putative phosphoryl-binding domains and within a hydrophobic sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2059109468,"In this study we have characterized two types of Ca2+ currents in identified neuron B5 of Helisoma and have examined the relationship between these currents and neurotransmitter release. Neuron B5 contains low-voltage-activated (LVA) and high-voltage-activated (HVA) Ca2+ currents. These currents have distinct electrophysiological and pharmacological properties. To gain access to the site of neurotransmitter release, we used a model system in which somata that do not extend neurites assume the role of neurotransmitter release. Before somata gain the ability to release neurotransmitter, they contain LVA and HVA Ca2+ currents. After 3 days of culture, when spherical somata have gained the secretory capacity, only the HVA Ca2+ current is present. Experiments were also performed when neurite extension was permitted. These data indicate that neurons with processes have a differential distribution of Ca2+ currents. The soma, which does not release neurotransmitter, contains both LVA and HVA Ca2+ currents, while distal secretory processes contain only HVA current."
https://openalex.org/W1572401476,"A method to analyze the DNA binding properties of RecA protein is developed to take into account the protein self-association reaction and is applied to reanalyze the interaction with chemically modified single-stranded DNA (e-DNA). Protein oligomerization is investigated by static light-scattering measurements and analyzed with the accumulated strain model. A coupled equilibrium between DNA binding and self-association of RecA is resolved considering that the complex formed between an m polymer (where m represents the number of units of the polymer) and DNA is identical to the complex resulting from the cooperative binding of m monomers. The cooperativity parameter thus determined is about 104, which is more than 100 times higher than the apparent parameter estimated without consideration of the protein oligomerization. This extremely high figure is in good agreement with the formation of large clusters of complex observed by electron microscopy. The apparent DNA binding constant depends upon the ratio of the DNA binding affinity and the self-association constant. For this reason, the variation of the DNA binding constant with the salt concentration is amplified, and the number of ion pairs formed between DNA and RecA obtained from the apparent salt dependence (11 ion pairs/monomer) has been overestimated. Only 2 ion pairs may be formed."
https://openalex.org/W1548052056,"Abstract We have attempted to purify the heme moiety of cytochrome b558 from human neutrophils. Cytochrome b558 was solubilized from the crude membrane fraction which was pretreated with both 1 M potassium phosphate buffer and 1% octyl glucoside at low ionic strength. The solubilization of cytochrome b558 was carried out efficiently with 1.6% octyl glucoside in the presence of 100 mM phosphate buffer. Solubilized cytochrome b558 was purified by hydroxylapatite, DEAE-Sephacel, and Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography. The specific content of purified cytochrome b558 was 37 nmol/mg of protein. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of purified cytochrome b558 revealed a single band of 20,000 Da. The large subunit of cytochrome b558, which has been reported by others, could not be found in purified cytochrome b558 even with silver staining. The amino acid composition of the heme-containing moiety of cytochrome b558 was abundant in hydrophobic amino acids. The circular dichroism spectra of both oxidized and reduced b558-type cytochromes exhibited bilobed bands with wavelengths of crossover points closely corresponding to those of the maxima in the optical absorbance spectra at the Soret region. Furthermore, there were some differences in the shoulders and peak widths of CD spectra between oxidized and reduced b558-type cytochromes. These results indicate that this method provides the purification of the small subunit of human cytochrome b558 which is the heme-carrying subunit of cytochrome b558, and suggest that cytochrome b558 has heme-heme interaction and some conformational changes in the alternation of the redox state."
https://openalex.org/W1512669095,"The antithrombin-binding region of heparin is a pentasaccharide sequence with the predominant structure -GlcNAc(6-OSO3)-GlcA-GlcNSO3(3,6-di-OSO3)-Ido A(2-OSO3)- GlcNSO3(6-OSO3)-. By using the 3-O-sulfated glucosamine residue as a marker for the anti-thrombin-binding sequence, the location of this sequence within the heparin chain was investigated. Heparin with high affinity for antithrombin (HA-heparin) contains few N-acetyl groups located outside the antithrombin-binding region, and cleavage at such groups was therefore expected to be essentially restricted to this region. HA-heparin was cleaved at N-acetylated glucosamine units by partial deacetylation followed by treatment with nitrous acid at pH 3.9, and the resulting fragments with low affinity for anti-thrombin (LA-fragments) were recovered after affinity chromatography on immobilized antithrombin. The LA-fragments were further divided into subfractions of different molecular size by gel chromatography and were then analyzed with regard to the occurrence of the nonreducing terminal GlcA-GlcNSO3(3,6-di-OSO3)- sequence. Such units were present in small, intermediate-sized as well as large fragments, suggesting that the antithrombin-binding regions were randomly distributed along the heparin chains. In another set of experiments, HA-heparin was subjected to limited, random depolymerization by nitrous acid (pH 1.5), and the resulting reducing terminal anhydromannose residues were labeled by treatment with NaB3H4. The molecular weight distributions of such labeled LA-fragments, determined by gel chromatography, again conformed to a random distribution of the antithrombin-binding sequence within the heparin chains. These results are in apparent disagreement with previous reports (Radoff, S., and Danishefsky, I. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 166–172; Rosenfeld, L., and Danishefsky, I. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 262–266) which suggest that the antithrombin-binding region is preferentially located at the nonreducing terminus of the heparin molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1608765656,"Abstract Different mechanisms for polarized sorting of apical and basolateral plasma membrane proteins appear to be operative in different cell types. In hepatocytes, all proteins are first transported to the basolateral surface, where sorting (probably signal-mediated) of apical proteins then takes place. In contrast, in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, proteins are directly transported from the trans-Golgi network to their appropriate plasma membrane domain. In order to study the differences in the sorting requirements of the two cell types, we have expressed a hepatocyte-specific basolateral membrane protein, the asialoglycoprotein receptor H1, in MDCK cells. H1 was found to be specifically transported to the basolateral domain also in this heterologous system, suggesting that either the same basolateral targeting signal is operative in both cell types or, more likely, that basolateral transport occurs by default, i.e. without the requirement for a sorting signal."
https://openalex.org/W2148341297,"The tryptophan fluorescence emission intensity at 340 nm of monomeric phospholipase A2 from Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus increased about 70% upon addition of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine small unilamellar vesicles (DPPC SUV) at 25 degrees C. The emission spectrum was also blue-shifted 6-8 nm, suggesting that the environment of 1 or more tryptophan residues had become less polar. This effect of SUV on the phospholipase A2 fluorescence was independent of Ca2+ at 25 degrees C, and the apparent association constant for the interaction was approximately 1.7 x 10(4) M-1. The apparent Km for hydrolysis of DPPC SUV was equal to the inverse of the estimated association constant. In the absence of Ca2+, the change in fluorescence intensity decreased with increasing temperature. Thermodynamic analysis of this reversible, temperature-dependent fluorescence change indicated that the A. p. piscivorus monomer phospholipase A2 interacts only with SUV in the true gel phase existing below the pretransition of gel to ripple phase lipid in the absence of Ca2+. In contrast, the fluorescence intensity change upon addition of SUV in the presence of Ca2+ was independent of temperature over the range of 25-48 degrees C. Under these conditions, hydrolysis of the lipid occurred concomitantly with the change in fluorescence which could not be reversed by the addition of EDTA. With a nonhydrolyzable analog of DPPC, however, the fluorescence changes upon mixing of SUV, Ca2+, and phospholipase A2 were reversible and temperature-dependent. Thus, the apparent irreversibility of the change in fluorescence observed with Ca2+ and DPPC SUV was correlated with hydrolysis of the vesicles. These results indicate that the magnitude of the initial interaction of enzyme with substrate is reversible, is Ca2+-independent, depends upon the lipid state, and is quantitatively correlated to the maximum rate of hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1588327341,"The genetic basis of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) deficiency has been identified by nucleotide sequence analysis of HPRT cDNAs cloned from a patient with gout. A single nucleotide change was identified in two independent clones: an A to G transition at nucleotide 602. Confirmation of a mutation at this site was provided by RNase mapping analysis. The predicted consequence of this transition is an aspartic acid to glycine substitution at amino acid 201. We have designated this variant HPRTAshville. Prior to this report, enzyme activity in HPRTAshville had not been detected by routine assay. Using more sensitive techniques, including an in situ gel assay for HPRT activity, we were able to demonstrate electrophoretic, kinetic, and structural differences between HPRTAshville and normal HPRT. Electrophoretic migration of HPRTAshville is more cathodal than normal, consistent with the predicted amino acid change. Additionally, HPRTAshville has elevated Michaelis constants for 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate and hypoxanthine. Predicted secondary structural alterations may result from the aspartic acid to glycine substitution."
https://openalex.org/W1561677577,"Abstract Several different agonists, among them alpha-thrombin, platelet-activating factor, vasopressin, thromboxane A2, and endoperoxides, activate platelets to aggregate and secrete granular contents. Each of these agents is thought to act by inducing the turnover of inositol phospholipids and generating the second messenger molecules inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and 1,2-diacylglycerol. However, within minutes, the action of these agonists desensitizes. We have studied the characteristics of this desensitization process for the agonists mentioned above in an attempt to clarify the mechanisms involved. Our results show that two different pathways of desensitization exist, one that is mediated by protein kinase C and another that is independent of this enzyme. In addition, the contribution of these pathways to desensitization differs for the agonists studied. Our data suggest that partial agonists and strong agonists differ in the rate at which the primary response is desensitized rather than in their ability to couple to phospholipase C."
https://openalex.org/W1606415527,"Several lines of evidence have suggested that glucocorticoid receptor function may be regulated by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reactions, and it has been proposed that dephosphorylation accompanies activation to the DNA-binding form. The phosphate content of the approximately 100-kDa steroid-binding protein has been determined directly and was found not to change during activation in intact cells (Mendel, D.B., Bodwell, J.E., and Munck, A. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5644-5648). We have now determined the effect of interaction with the receptor and of activation on the phosphate content of the approximately 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp 90), which is thought to be a non-steroid-binding subunit of nonactivated glucocorticoid receptors that dissociates on activation. Monoclonal antibodies AC88 and BuGR2 were used to purify free Hsp 90 and cytosolic nonactivated glucocorticoid-receptor complexes, respectively, from WEHI-7 cells grown in the presence of 32Pi and [35S] methionine. Cell-free activation of the nonactivated receptor-antibody complexes immobilized on protein A-Sepharose minicolumns allowed the recovery of the Hsp 90 dissociated from the complexes during activation. Proteins were separated by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the 32P/35S ratio, which was used as a measure of the phosphate content relative to protein, was determined for the free, receptor-associated, and dissociated forms of the Hsp 90, as well as for the approximately 100-kDa steroid-binding protein of non-activated and activated receptors. The three forms of the Hsp 90 had the same phosphate contents, as did the approximately 100-kDa steroid-binding protein before and after activation. Based upon these results, we conclude that no net change in the phosphorylation occurs when the Hsp 90 associates with the approximately 100-kDa steroid-binding protein to form nonactivated receptors and that neither protein component of nonactivated complexes is dephosphorylated when they dissociate during thermal activation under cell-free conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1579667046,"The vaccinia virus nicking-joining (NJ) enzyme has been purified to homogeneity from a preparation of virus cores. The virus-specific DNA-dependent enzyme, which does not require ATP, is a single polypeptide of Mr 50,000 and possesses both endonuclease and ligase activities. The principal end product of the enzyme activity, following incubation with closed circular DNA of sufficient linking deficiency, is a linear DNA in which one of the termini has become cross-linked by the in vitro formation of a hairpin. The ability of the NJ enzyme to cross-link DNA is significantly enhanced by in vitro proteolysis. The enzymatic properties of the proteolytic digestion product, a 44-kDa polypeptide, differ in several other ways from the intact NJ enzyme. In particular, the specific activity is enhanced and the ionic strength optimum is shifted toward higher salt concentrations. It is suggested that the purified 50-kDa species is a pronuclease that is activated by proteolytic processing."
https://openalex.org/W1656818548,"Abstract Dopamine beta-hydroxylase exists in bovine adrenal medulla chromaffin granules in both soluble and membrane-bound forms. The mechanism by which membranous dopamine beta-hydroxylase is bound to granule membranes has been elusive. Recently, evidence that covalently attached phosphatidylinositol does not serve as an anchor for membranous dopamine beta-hydroxylase was reported (Stewart, L. C., and Klinman, J. P. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 12183-12186). It was suggested that an uncleaved signal sequence could serve as a mode of attachment for the membrane-bound hydroxylase. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of purified bovine membranous dopamine beta-hydroxylase demonstrates that this form of the enzyme possesses an amino-terminal sequence similar to the soluble enzyme. Additionally, the 75- and 72-kDa bands of membranous dopamine beta-hydroxylase were electrophoretically eluted from a preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and sequenced. Both bands had the amino-terminal sequence characteristic of the soluble bovine enzyme. These sequence results eliminate the possibility that an uncleaved signal sequence serves as the membrane anchor."
https://openalex.org/W1561931727,"Glycoprotein Ia (GP Ia) is a relatively minor component of human blood platelets thought to be a receptor involved in collagen-induced platelet activation. However, some difficulties exist with the definition of this glycoprotein. The expression of GP la on resting (prostacyclin analogue-treated) and thrombin-activated platelets was compared by surface labeling with 125I-lactoperoxidase. Intact platelets or platelets solubilized in sodium dodecyl sulfate were labeled with periodate/[3H]NaBH4. Analysis on two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels showed that GP Ia is very poorly labeled in resting platelets. After activation a new spot (GP Ia*) appears with the same relative molecular mass as GP Ia under reducing conditions. GP Ia and Ia* can be clearly separated by two-dimensional nonreduced/reduced gel electrophoresis. Therefore, two glycoproteins which have been termed GP Ia exist in platelets with similar molecular weight and pI under reducing conditions. One of these (GP Ia*) is only surface-labeled when platelets are activated, indicating that it is only exposed on the surface of activated platelets. Supernatant from activated platelets contains this glycoprotein as well as other granule components. This glycoprotein is missing in platelets from two patients with collagen-response defects."

This unit is absent from the Thy-1 of several lymphoma mutants that synthesize the Thy-1 polypeptide but fail to express it at the cell surface. Recessive mutants of complementation groups A to C, E, and F contain Thy-1 mRNA of normal size, which suggests that their Thy-1 polypeptide is normal. To identify possible metabolic lesions, each mutant was grown with various supplements. The class F and B mutants exhibited a reversible induction of surface lipid anchored Thy-1 when grown with the aminoglycoside G418. Other aminoglycosides, sugars, and ethanolamine were inactive. These unexpected observations are discussed in the context of lipid anchor biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1531934258,"Abstract L-Thyroxine selectively inhibited Ca2+-calmodulin-activated myosin light chain kinases (MLC kinase) purified from rabbit skeletal muscle, chicken gizzard smooth muscle, bovine thyroid gland, and human platelet with similar Ki values (Ki = 2.5 microM). A detailed analysis of L-thyroxine inhibition of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase activation was undertaken in order to determine the effect of L-thyroxine on the stoichiometries of Ca2+, calmodulin, and the enzyme in the activation process. The kinetic data indicated that L-thyroxine does not interact with calmodulin but, instead, through direct association with the enzyme, inhibits the binding of the Ca2+-calmodulin complex to MLC kinase. L-[125I]Thyroxine gel overlay revealed that the 95-kDa fragment of chicken gizzard MLC kinase digested by chymotrypsin and all the fragments of 110, 94, 70, and 43 kDa produced by Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease digestion which contain the calmodulin binding domain retain L-[125I]thyroxine binding activity, whereas smaller peptides were not radioactive. Since MLC kinase is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (2 mol of phosphate/mol of MLC kinase), the effect of L-thyroxine on the phosphorylation of MLC kinase also was examined. L-Thyroxine binding did not inhibit the phosphorylation of MLC kinase and, moreover, reversed the inhibition of phosphorylation obtained with the calmodulin-enzyme complex. These observations support the suggestion that L-thyroxine binds at or near the calmodulin-binding site of MLC kinase. L-Thyroxine may serve as a different type of pharmacological tool for elucidating the biological significance of MLC kinase-mediated reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1486117857,"Abstract Treatment of 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate with sodium periodate resulted in oxidation of the ribose linked to 3-aminopyridine ring and cleavage of the dinucleotide into 3-aminopyridine and adenosine moieties. These two moieties were separated by thin layer chromatography and were synergistically bound to pigeon liver malic enzyme (EC 1.1.1.40), causing inactivation of the enzyme. The inactivation showed saturation kinetics. The apparent binding constant for the reversible enzyme-reagent binary complex (KI) and the maximum inactivation rate constant at saturating reagent concentration (kmax) were found to be 1.1 +/- 0.02 mM and 0.068 +/- 0.001 min-1, respectively. L-Malate at low concentration enhanced the inactivation rate by lowering the KI value whereas high malate concentration increased the kmax. Mn2+ or NADP+ partially protected the enzyme from the inactivation and gave additive protection when used together. L-Malate eliminated the protective effect of NADP+ or Mn2+. Maximum and synergistic protection was afforded by NADP+, Mn2+ plus L-malate (or tartronate). Oxidized and cleaved 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate was also found to be a competitive inhibitor versus NADP+ in the oxidative decarboxylation reaction catalyzed by malic enzyme with a Ki value of 4.1 +/- 0.1 microM. 3-Aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate or its periodate-oxidized cleaved products bound to the enzyme anticooperatively. Oxidized 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate labeled the nucleotide binding site of the enzyme with a fluorescent probe which may be readily traced or quantified. The completely inactivated enzyme incorporated 2 mol of reagent/mol of enzyme tetramer. The inactivation was partially reversible by dilution and could be made irreversible by treating the modified enzyme with sodium borohydride. This fluorescent compound and its counterpart-oxidized 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide may be a potential affinity label for all other NAD(P)+-dependent dehydrogenases."
https://openalex.org/W1555104982,"Abstract Chromaffin granule ghosts from bovine adrenal medullae have been used to investigate the effects of prototypic dopamine beta-monooxygenase substrate analogs of two distinct classes on intravesicular reduced ascorbic acid (AscH2) levels and on norepinephrine synthesis. Phenyl-2-aminoethyl sulfide (PAES), a sulfur-containing substrate, was shown to concentrate within ghosts, a process that was time and ATP dependent, but reserpine insensitive. Dopamine beta-monooxygenase oxygenation of PAES resulted in accumulation of the oxygenation product, PAESO, without affecting intravesicular levels of AscH2. Similarly, incubations of ghosts with phenyl-2-aminoethyl selenide (PAESe) also resulted in rapid, time- and ATP-dependent, but reserpine-insensitive uptake. However, oxygenation of PAESe by dopamine beta-monooxygenase within ghosts was found to cause a marked decrease in intravesicular AscH2, without buildup of the oxygenated product, phenyl 2-aminoethyl selenoxide. These results illustrate two basic differences between the consequences of PAES and PAESe turnover: while PAES accumulation proceeds concomitant with PAESO production and without AscH2 depletion, PAESe accumulation proceeds with a marked lowering of internal AscH2 but without observable product formation. Both PAES and PAESe were capable of competing with dopamine, the physiological substrate, for enzymatic oxygenation and/or vesicular uptake, and were capable of significantly reducing norepinephrine synthesis. In experiments where ghosts were preincubated with either PAES or PAESe with delayed addition of dopamine, it was clear that neither compound nor their oxygenated products interfered with electron transport via cytochrome b561. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the physiological activity observed with both PAES and PAESe may be related to their ability to gain entrance to adrenergic neurons and decrease norepinephrine synthesis within neurotransmitter storage vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1570811951,"Abstract We have employed a mouse liver-derived cell line (BNL) to identify DNA sequences in the promoter of the serum amyloid A3 (SAA3) gene essential for expression. In both transient DNA transfection assays and BNL cells stably transformed with SAA3 fusion genes, deletion analysis of the SAA3 promoter indicates that sequences between -185 and -138 base pairs 5' to the transcription initiation site are essential for expression of heterologous genes. A 69-base pair sequence spanning this region markedly augmented expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol transacetylase gene regardless of orientation or position. The homology of this sequence with sequences in the promotors of other genes expressed by liver during inflammation suggests a common mechanism of regulation."
