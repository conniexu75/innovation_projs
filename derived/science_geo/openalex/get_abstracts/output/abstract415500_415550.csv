https://openalex.org/W2045442440,"Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) mediate both perception and release of semiochemicals in insects. These proteins are the ideal targets for understanding the olfactory code of insects as well as for interfering with their communication system in order to control pest species. The two sibling Lepidopteran species Helicoverpa armigera and H. assulta are two major agricultural pests. As part of our aim to characterize the OBP repertoire of these two species, here we focus our attention on a member of this family, OBP10, particularly interesting for its expression pattern. The protein is specifically expressed in the antennae of both sexes, being absent from other sensory organs. However, it is highly abundant in seminal fluid, is transferred to females during mating and is eventually found on the surface of fertilised eggs. Among the several different volatile compounds present in reproductive organs, OBP10 binds 1-dodecene, a compound reported as an insect repellent. These results have been verified in both H. armigera and H. assulta with no apparent differences between the two species. The recombinant OBP10 binds, besides 1-dodecene, some linear alcohols and several aromatic compounds. The structural similarity of OBP10 with OBP1 of the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus, a protein reported to bind an oviposition pheromone, and its affinity with 1-dodecene suggest that OBP10 could be a carrier for oviposition deterrents, favouring spreading of the eggs in these species where cannibalism is active among larvae."
https://openalex.org/W2015207539,"It has been reported that IDH1 (IDH1R132) mutation was a frequent genomic alteration in grade II and grade III glial tumors but rare in primary glioblastoma (pGBM). To elucidate the frequency of IDH1 mutation and its clinical significance in Chinese patients with pGBM, one hundred eighteen pGBMs were assessed by pyro-sequencing for IDH1 mutation status, and the results were correlated with clinical characteristics and molecular pathological factors. IDH1 mutations were detected in 19/118 pGBM cases (16.1%). Younger age, methylated MGMT promoter, high expression of mutant P53 protein, low expression of Ki-67 or EGFR protein were significantly correlated with IDH1 mutation status. Most notably, we identified pGBM cases with IDH1 mutation were mainly involved in the frontal lobe when compared with those with wild-type IDH1. In addition, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed a highly significant association between IDH1 mutation and a better clinical outcome (p = 0.026 for progression-free survival; p = 0.029 for overall survival). However, in our further multivariable regression analysis, the independent prognostic effect of IDH1 mutation is limited when considering age, preoperative KPS score, extent of resection, TMZ chemotherapy, and Ki-67 protein expression levels, which might narrow its prognostic power in Chinese population in the future."

This ancient cell type is unique in containing a giant secretory vesicle derived from the Golgi apparatus. The organelle structure within the vesicle comprises an elastically stretched capsule (nematocyst) to which a long tubule is attached. During exocytosis, the barbed part of the tubule is accelerated with >5 million g in <700 ns, enabling a harpoon-like discharge (Nüchter, T., Benoit, M., Engel, U., Ozbek, S., and Holstein, T. W. (2006) Curr. Biol. 16, R316–R318). Hitherto, the molecular components responsible for the organelle's biomechanical properties were largely unknown. Here, we describe the proteome of nematocysts from the freshwater polyp Hydra magnipapillata. Our analysis revealed an unexpectedly complex secretome of 410 proteins with venomous and lytic but also adhesive or fibrous properties. In particular, the insoluble fraction of the nematocyst represents a functional extracellular matrix structure of collagenous and elastic nature. This finding suggests an evolutionary scenario in which exocytic vesicles harboring a venomous secretome assembled a sophisticated predatory structure from extracellular matrix motif proteins.

Intriguingly, many toxins share close structural and functional properties with ECM proteins, indicating a common evolutionary origin or co-evolution (4Eble J.A.

Nematocysts or cnidae are highly complex projectile organelles used for capture of prey and defense in all cnidarians (5Mariscal R.N.

They are produced in specialized stem cell derivatives called nematocytes by a continuous secretory process of proteins into a giant post-Golgi vesicle. Nematocysts are composed of a cylindrical capsule body to which an extended tubule is attached that is often armed with spines. The capsule morphology varies among different cnidarian species, with a general tendency toward higher complexity in medusozoans compared with anthozoans (7David C.N. Ozbek S. Adamczyk P. Meier S.

In Hydra, four types of nematocysts are present: the small desmonemes, with a tightly coiled tubule used for prey attachment; the holotrichous and spineless atrichous isorhizas; and the large stenoteles, with a prominent stylet apparatus at the tubule base employed for piercing solid cuticle structures (8Chapman G.B.

The molecular composition of the capsule comprises a highly dense collagenous polymer charged with an osmotic pressure of 150 bars (11Lenhoff H.M. Kline E.S. Hurley R.

Nematocyst discharge, triggered by the mechanosensory cnidocil apparatus, is one of the fastest processes in biology and creates an impact on the harpoon-like expelled tubule comparable with technical bullets (1Nüchter T.

Of the protein components constituting the nematocyst, only a small fraction has hitherto been defined. These include mainly structural proteins like the large family of minicollagens (13Kurz E.M.

Here, we present a proteome analysis of Hydra nematocysts, showing an unusual composition of venomous and structural proteins forming one of the most sophisticated organelles in the animal kingdom. Hydra magnipapillata was used for all experiments. Animals were cultured in Hydra medium at 18 °C and fed two to three times a week with freshly hatched Artemia salina nauplii. Animals used for the experiments were starved for 24 h. Intact nematocysts were isolated from whole Hydra tissue as described (18Weber J. Nematocysts (stinging capsules of Cnidaria) as Donnan potential-dominated osmotic systems.Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Nematocyst proteins were separated on a one-dimensional NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gel (pH 6.4) (Invitrogen) and stained with colloidal Coomassie Blue. The resulting gel was cut into 27 pieces. In-gel tryptic digestion and extraction were performed as described previously (19Schokraie E. Hotz-Wagenblatt A. Warnken U. Mali B. Frohme M. Förster F. Dandekar T. Hengherr S. Schill R.O. Schnölzer M. Proteomic analysis of tardigrades: towards a better understanding of molecular mechanisms by anhydrobiotic organisms.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5e9502Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Peptide separation was achieved using a nano-ACQUITY UPLC® system (Waters). The nano-UPLC system was coupled on-line to an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher). Data-dependent acquisition using Xcalibur 2.0.6 (Thermo Fisher) was performed by one Fourier transform MS scan with a resolution of 60,000 and a range from m/z 370 to 2000 in parallel with six MS/MS scans of the most intense precursor ions in the ion trap. The mgf files were used for database searches with the MASCOT search engine (Matrix Science, London, United Kingdom) against Hydra Hma2 protein models (20Chapman J.A. Kirkness E.F. Simakov O.

Protein separation was performed with the PROTEAN system (Bio-Rad). The protein samples were applied to PROTEAN ReadyStrip immobilized pH gradient (IPG) 17-cm pH 3.0–10.0 strips (Bio-Rad). Isolated capsules (6 million) were solubilized in 260 mm DTT and 1× PBS for 3 h at 29 °C. The soluble fraction (supernatant) was precipitated with chloroform/methanol and loaded onto the IPG strip (passive rehydration overnight), and the insoluble fraction (pellet) was further solubilized in lysis buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 1% IPG buffer (PharmalyteTM), and 130 mm DTT) at 29 °C for 3 h before precipitation and loading onto the IPG strip. Rehydration was done passively overnight with rehydration buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% (w/v) CHAPS, 2% (v/v) IPG buffer (IPG pH 3–10 strip), and 18.2 mm DTT). Isoelectric focusing was done with the Bio-Rad IEF system. The second dimension electrophoresis was done on 12% polyacrylamide gels in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8) and 0.2% SDS at a constant current mode of 17 mA/gel for 12 h with running buffer (2.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 19.2 mm glycine, and 0.01% SDS) in a Bio-Rad PROTEAN II xi cell system. To visualize the protein spots on the gel, the colloidal Coomassie Blue staining procedure was employed. From the two fractions together, 186 spots were visualized, excised, and digested with trypsin as described (19Schokraie E. Hotz-Wagenblatt A. Warnken U. Mali B. Frohme M. Förster F. Dandekar T.

Data acquisition was controlled by MassLynxTM 4.0 software (Waters). Data files were processed with Protein Lynx Global Server 2.2 software (Waters). De-isotoping was performed using the MaxEnt3 algorithm. The data obtained were analyzed with the MASCOT algorithm (version 2.1.04, Matrix Science) for protein identification against Hydra Hma2 protein models (20Chapman J.A. Kirkness E.F. Simakov O.

The annotation of the nematocyst proteome was performed manually for all protein sequences using the EMADT (extensive manual annotation(s) by domain(s) and taxonomy) protocol developed heuristically for this analysis. The protein sequences were analyzed by PSI-BLAST (21Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59762) Google Scholar) with default algorithm parameters. The E value cutoff was set at 1e−05. The protein domains including the number of repeats identified by the Conserved Domains Database were noted. Domains were also analyzed in parallel using InterProScan, and signal peptide prediction was performed using the SignalP 3.0 server. The redundancy of identified domains was checked, and the annotation was manually curated if necessary. Multidomain proteins were analyzed for every single domain in the sequence. Functional organization of the proteome was done based on the domains identified. Predicted peptide data sets were retrieved from the DOE Joint Genome Institute (www.jgi.doe.gov/; Nematostella vectensis, Monosiga brevicollis, and Trichoplax adhaerens), from NCBI (ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/; Strongylocentrus purpuratus), and from the Ensembl Database (Branchiostoma floridae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and Homo sapiens) as of June 10, 2010. BLASTp from the NCBI blastall package (21Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59762) Google Scholar) was used to scan all nematocyst proteins against all reference proteomes mentioned above for the identification of orthologs. BLASTp was run with an E value cutoff of 10−5 and the parameters −F “m S” and −s T for soft filtering of low complexity regions and locally optimal Smith-Waterman alignments, respectively (parameter −F “m S” refers to soft filtering of low complexity regions, and parameter −s T refers to locally optimal Smith-Waterman alignments). The BLAST output was further filtered to include only hits, which correspond to query sequence coverage of at least 30%. Protein domains were annotated based on InterPro (22Hunter S. Apweiler R. Attwood T.K. Bairoch A. Bateman A. Binns D. Bork P. Das U. Daugherty L. Duquenne L. Finn R.D. Gough J. Haft D. Hulo N. Kahn D. Kelly E. Laugraud A. Letunic I. Lonsdale D. Lopez R. Madera M. Maslen J.

InterPro: the integrative protein signature database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: D211-D215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar) domain definitions. Overlapping domain annotations were resolved by removing the annotation with the less significant E value. Putative nematocyst venom proteins were identified based on similarity to known venom proteins stored in the Tox-Prot Database (23Jungo F. Bairoch A. Tox-Prot, the toxin protein annotation program of the Swiss-Prot protein knowledge base.Toxicon. 2005; 45: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). A BLAST search of all nematocyst proteins versus all sequences in the Tox-Prot Database yielded 54 putative nematocyst venom proteins (E < 10−5). The 117 nematocyst orphan proteins (without hits in the reference genomes and without InterPro domains) were clustered based on sequence similarity using BLASTclust (21Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs.Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59762) Google Scholar). Proteins with 25% sequence identity in a region spanning at least 35% of the sequence length were clustered together. This procedure yielded two clusters of sizes 10 and 9, respectively. Both clusters were aligned using T-Coffee (24Poirot O. O'Toole E. Notredame C. [email protected]: a web server for computing, evaluating, and combining multiple sequence alignments.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3503-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and a hidden Markov model based on those alignments was scanned against the NCBI non-redundant protein database using HMMER. This scan yielded significant hits in proteins containing the sweet tooth domain for the cluster of size 3. The three proteins in the nematocyst-specific cluster were predicted to have nucleotide-binding activity based on an analysis with the I-TASSER server (25Roy A. Kucukural A. Zhang Y. I-TASSER: a unified platform for automated protein structure and function prediction.Nat. Protoc. 2010; 5: 725-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4670) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the conserved region in the three proteins of the Hydra-specific cluster was predicted to be globular (instead of disordered or fibrous) (26Linding R. Russell R.B. Neduva V. Gibson T.J. GlobPlot: Exploring protein sequences for globularity and disorder.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3701-3708Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Preparation of whole RNA was performed using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The isolated RNA was transcribed by reverse transcriptase into cDNA. PCR for the Cnidoin coding sequence was performed using primers ATGTCTCGATTACTACTTC (forward) and TTATCTCTTTTTACCAAAAGCTCC (reverse). The purified PCR product was ligated into the pGEM-T vector (Promega) and confirmed by sequencing. Recombinant expression in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells was performed with a pET-21b vector (Novagen), which introduces a C-terminal polyhistidine tag. Cnidoin protein was exclusively found in inclusion bodies and purified under denaturing conditions (8 m urea) using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads. H. magnipapillata animals were relaxed in 2% urethane in Hydra medium and then fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in Hydra medium for 30 min. The fixative was removed by three 10-min washing steps with PBS and 0.1% Triton X-100. The antibody was diluted 1:250 in PBS and 1% BSA and incubated overnight at 4 °C. In the case of co-staining with two antibodies, both antibodies (anti-minicollagen-1, 1:500 dilution) were incubated simultaneously overnight at 4 °C. To remove unbound antibodies, three 10-min washing steps with PBS and 0.1% Triton X-100 were performed. Incubation with the secondary antibodies was performed for 2 h at room temperature. For detection of Cnidoin, an Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig antibody was used; for detection of minicollagen-1, an Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was used. The secondary antibodies were diluted 1:400 in PBS and 1% BSA. To remove unbound antibodies, the animals were washed three times with PBS and then mounted on object slides with PBS and 90% glycerol. Fluorescent images were captured with a Nikon A1R confocal laser scanning microscope at the Nikon Imaging Center at the University of Heidelberg. In situ images were captured with a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope. We isolated intact undischarged nematocysts (stenoteles, desmonemes, and atrichous and holotrichous isorhizas) (14Holstein T.W. Benoit M. Herder G.V. David C.N. Wanner G. Gaub H.E. Fibrous minicollagens in Hydra nematocysts.Science. 1994; 265: 402-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) from H. magnipapillata by density gradient centrifugation (18Weber J. Nematocysts (stinging capsules of Cnidaria) as Donnan potential-dominated osmotic systems.Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 465-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The purity of the preparation was confirmed by light and electron microscopy (Fig. 1, C and D). The nematocyst preparation was solubilized by DTT/SDS treatment and separated by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Gel slices (n = 27) covering the whole molecular mass range (Fig. 1E) were subjected to Orbitrap MS analysis. Fig. 1F shows that the nematocyst proteins exhibited a Gaussian distribution regarding their molecular masses, with the majority ranging between 10 and 40 kDa. One-dimensional gels guaranteed higher protein yields than two-dimensional gels, which were analyzed in parallel (supplemental Fig. 1). Annotation of the obtained nematocyst protein sequences was performed by a manual procedure applying PSI-BLAST and InterProScan analyses in parallel (EMADT; see “Experimental Procedures” for details). By this approach and the application of a MASCOT protein score threshold of 50 to exclude insignificant hits, we identified a total number of 410 unique protein sequences (supplemental Table 1). An additional 25 sequences from the full proteome analysis were categorized as contaminants and included histones, ribosomal proteins, cytoskeletal components, and cytoplasmic enzymes. The fraction of cellular contaminants in the complete proteome was low as estimated from the intensity of the actin spot in the two-dimensional resolution of the nematocyst sample (supplemental Fig. 1). Almost one-third of the protein sequences are lacking a signal peptide, which is supposed to be due to incomplete protein models, unusual secretion as in galectins, or co-purification of cytoplasmic proteins tightly associated with the nematocyst membrane. Functionally, the proteome is characterized by three groups of similar size: enzymes, structural proteins, and novel sequences. Many enzymes are part of the venom proteome, and the group of structural proteins is composed mainly of sequences with ECM motifs. The detailed annotations are shown in Fig. 2A and supplemental Table 1. To obtain the proteome of the components that are firmly integrated into the capsule wall and tubule structures, we prepared nematocyst “shells” by extensive SDS washing of capsules that were discharged in vitro. The shell proteome (supplemental Table 2) contained 98 proteins. As expected, the ratio of structural proteins was substantially increased in this subset of the proteome (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the ratio of novel proteins did not decrease in the shell proteome, indicating that a significant portion of this group has a structural function. To analyze the percentage of exclusive nematocyst proteins in our data set, we generated nematocyst-free hydras by hydroxyurea treatment (27Yaross M.S. Bode H.R. Regulation of interstitial cell differentiation in Hydra attenuata. III. Effects of I-cell and nerve cell densities.J. Cell Sci. 1978; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This procedure eliminates all stem cells and their progeny, nerve cells, and nematocytes, rendering these “epithelial” animals incapable of active feeding. A lysate from epithelial hydras was subjected to mass spectrometric analysis under identical conditions, yielding 65 proteins, mostly enzymes with broad cellular functions that are shared with the nematocyst proteome (supplemental Table 3). This indicates that the majority of proteins (84%) from the analysis of isolated capsules were nematocyst-specific gene products. Of the nematocyte-specific genes isolated by Hwang et al.

These constitute only 2.4% of the total nematocyst proteome, which probably reflects a bias of the cDNA screen toward strongly expressed genes with functions in cell differentiation and proliferation.FIGURE 2Distribution of functional nematocyst proteome.

Although most of the metabolic proteins are conserved between both species, the number of novel and structural proteins is markedly pronounced in Hydra, which might indicate a large diversity between nematocyst proteins of different taxa or a higher morphological complexity of hydrozoan nematocysts (7David C.N.

We categorized the novel proteins into four groups: sequences 1) unique to the proteome of Hydra nematocysts, 2) unique to Hydra, 3) unique to Hydra and Nematostella, and 4) not exclusive to cnidarians (supplemental Table 1). Fig. 3B extends this comparison and shows the evolutionary distribution of the proteome among metazoans and eukaryotes. Overall, Hydra nematocysts comprise a gene repertoire of which 5% are cnidarian-specific with homologs exclusively in Nematostella, and 18% have homologs in Eumetazoa and 31% in Eukaryota. An additional 18% have no detectable homologs in other proteomes but contain InterPro domains. 28% of the sequences were classified as orphan genes. Among the proteins with detectable InterPro domains, several structural and enzymatic domains, e.g. α-collagen, AbfB, and von Willebrand factor, are strongly overrepresented (Fig. 3C). Among the remaining orphan proteins, several can be grouped together based on conserved common motifs (see “Experimental Procedures”). Ten proteins in the largest cluster contain the “sweet tooth” domain, which was reported to be among the most abundant extracellular protein domains in the Hydra genome but is not integrated in InterPro yet (30Denker E.

Biol. 2008; 18: R858-R859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The three orphan proteins of the second largest cluster share very high sequence identity (>80%) and are predicted to be globular and to have a nucleotide-binding propensity (see “Experimental Procedures”). A hidden Markov model created from their alignment (Fig. 3D) was scanned against the NCBI non-redundant database but returned no significant hit. Consequently, this protein structure seems to be unique for the proteome of the Hydra nematocyst and deserves further functional analysis.

https://openalex.org/W2012135972,"Background Cancer-associated fibroblasts, comprised of activated fibroblasts or myofibroblasts, are found in the stroma surrounding solid tumors. These myofibroblasts promote invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. Mechanisms regulating the activation of the fibroblasts and the initiation of invasive tumorigenesis are of great interest. Upregulation of the cytoskeletal protein, palladin, has been detected in the stromal myofibroblasts surrounding many solid cancers and in expression screens for genes involved in invasion. Using a pancreatic cancer model, we investigated the functional consequence of overexpression of exogenous palladin in normal fibroblasts in vitro and its effect on the early stages of tumor invasion. Principal Findings Palladin expression in stromal fibroblasts occurs very early in tumorigenesis. In vivo, concordant expression of palladin and the myofibroblast marker, alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), occurs early at the dysplastic stages in peri-tumoral stroma and progressively increases in pancreatic tumorigenesis. In vitro introduction of exogenous 90 kD palladin into normal human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) induces activation of stromal fibroblasts into myofibroblasts as marked by induction of α-SMA and vimentin, and through the physical change of cell morphology. Moreover, palladin expression in the fibroblasts enhances cellular migration, invasion through the extracellular matrix, and creation of tunnels through which cancer cells can follow. The fibroblast invasion and creation of tunnels results from the development of invadopodia-like cellular protrusions which express invadopodia proteins and proteolytic enzymes. Palladin expression in fibroblasts is triggered by the co-culture of normal fibroblasts with k-ras-expressing epithelial cells. Conclusions Overall, palladin expression can impart myofibroblast properties, in turn promoting the invasive potential of these peri-tumoral cells with invadopodia-driven degradation of extracellular matrix. Palladin expression in fibroblasts can be triggered by k-ras expression in adjacent epithelial cells. This data supports a model whereby palladin-activated fibroblasts facilitate stromal-dependent metastasis and outgrowth of tumorigenic epithelium."

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a human commensal bacterium that has the capacity to cause life-threatening meningitis and septicemia in newborns. Electron microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis demonstrated the surface localization of GAPDH in GBS. By addressing the question of GAPDH export to the cell surface of GBS strain NEM316 and isogenic mutant derivatives of our collection, we found that impaired GAPDH presence in the surface and supernatant of GBS was associated with a lower level of bacterial lysis. We also found that following GBS lysis, GAPDH can associate to the surface of many living bacteria. Finally, we provide evidence for a novel function of the secreted GAPDH as an inducer of apoptosis of murine macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W2149968000,"Background All three nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms are expressed in atherosclerotic plaques. NOS enzymes in general catalyse NO production. However, under conditions of substrate and cofactor deficiency, the enzyme directly catalyse superoxide formation. Considering this alternative chemistry, the effects of NOS on key events in spontaneous hyperlipidemia driven atherosclerosis have not been investigated yet. Here, we evaluate how endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) modulates leukocyte/endothelial- (L/E) and platelet/endothelial- (P/E) interactions in atherosclerosis and the production of nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide by the enzyme. Principal Findings Intravital microscopy (IVM) of carotid arteries revealed significantly increased L/E-interactions in apolipoproteinE/eNOS double knockout mice (apoE−/−/eNOS−/−), while P/E-interactions did not differ, compared to apoE−/−. eNOS deficiency increased macrophage infiltration in carotid arteries and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression, both in endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Despite the expression of other NOS isoforms (inducible NOS, iNOS and neuronal NOS, nNOS) in plaques, Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) measurements of NO showed significant contribution of eNOS to total circulating and vascular wall NO production. Pharmacological inhibition and genetic deletion of eNOS reduced vascular superoxide production, indicating uncoupling of the enzyme in apoE−/− vessels. Conclusion Overt plaque formation, increased vascular inflammation and L/E- interactions are associated with significant reduction of superoxide production in apoE−/−/eNOS−/− vessels. Therefore, lack of eNOS does not cause an automatic increase in oxidative stress. Uncoupling of eNOS occurs in apoE−/− atherosclerosis but does not negate the enzyme's strong protective effects."
https://openalex.org/W2018343961,"While studying the functions of CCM3/PDCD10, a gene encoding an adaptor protein whose mutation results in vascular malformations, we have found that it is involved in a novel response to oxidative stress that results in phosphorylation and activation of the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family of proteins. This phosphorylation protects cells from accidental cell death induced by oxidative stress. We also present evidence that ERM phosphorylation is performed by the GCKIII kinase Mst4, which is activated and relocated to the cell periphery after oxidative stress. The cellular levels of Mst4 and its activation after oxidative stress depend on the presence of CCM3, as absence of the latter impairs the phosphorylation of ERM proteins and enhances death of cells exposed to reactive oxygen species. These findings shed new light on the response of cells to oxidative stress and identify an important pathophysiological situation in which ERM proteins and their phosphorylation play a significant role."
https://openalex.org/W2078913374,"The farnesoid-x-receptor (FXR) is a bile acid sensor expressed in the liver and gastrointestinal tract. Despite FXR ligands are under investigation for treatment of cholestasis, a biochemical condition occurring in a number of liver diseases for which available therapies are poorly effective, mice harboring a disrupted FXR are protected against liver injury caused by bile acid overload in rodent models of cholestasis. Theonellasterol is a 4-methylene-24-ethylsteroid isolated from the marine sponge Theonella swinhoei. Here, we have characterized the activity of this theonellasterol on FXR-regulated genes and biological functions.Interrogation of HepG2 cells, a human hepatocyte cell line, by microarray analysis and transactivation assay shows that theonellasterol is a selective FXR antagonist, devoid of any agonistic or antagonistic activity on a number of human nuclear receptors including the vitamin D receptor, PPARs, PXR, LXRs, progesterone, estrogen, glucorticoid and thyroid receptors, among others. Exposure of HepG2 cells to theonellasterol antagonizes the effect of natural and synthetic FXR agonists on FXR-regulated genes, including SHP, OSTα, BSEP and MRP4. A proof-of-concept study carried out to investigate whether FXR antagonism rescues mice from liver injury caused by the ligation of the common bile duct, a model of obstructive cholestasis, demonstrated that theonellasterol attenuates injury caused by bile duct ligation as measured by assessing serum alanine aminostrasferase levels and extent of liver necrosis at histopathology. Analysis of genes involved in bile acid uptake and excretion by hepatocytes revealed that theonellasterol increases the liver expression of MRP4, a basolateral transporter that is negatively regulated by FXR. Administering bile duct ligated mice with an FXR agonist failed to rescue from liver injury and downregulated the expression of MRP4.FXR antagonism in vivo results in a positive modulation of MRP4 expression in the liver and is a feasible strategy to target obstructive cholestasis."

Their importance during embryonic development in patterning and morphogenesis of the vertebrate eye is well known, but less is known about the role of Fgfs in the adult vertebrate retina. To address Fgf function in adult retina, we determined the spatial distribution of components of the Fgf signaling pathway in the adult zebrafish retina. We detected differential expression of Fgf receptors, ligands and downstream Fgf targets within specific retinal layers. Furthermore, we blocked Fgf signaling in the retina, by expressing a dominant negative variant of Fgf receptor 1 conditionally in transgenic animals. After blocking Fgf signaling we observe a fast and progressive photoreceptor degeneration and disorganization of retinal tissue, coupled with cell death in the outer nuclear layer. Following the degeneration of photoreceptors, a profound regeneration response is triggered that starts with proliferation in the inner nuclear layer. Ultimately, rod and cone photoreceptors are regenerated completely. Our study reveals the requirement of Fgf signaling to maintain photoreceptors and for proliferation during regeneration in the adult zebrafish retina."
https://openalex.org/W1971067462,"Despite a commitment by the European Union to protect its migratory bat populations, conservation efforts are hindered by a poor understanding of bat migratory strategies and connectivity between breeding and wintering grounds. Traditional methods like mark-recapture are ineffective to study broad-scale bat migratory patterns. Stable hydrogen isotopes (δD) have been proven useful in establishing spatial migratory connectivity of animal populations. Before applying this tool, the method was calibrated using bat samples of known origin. Here we established the potential of δD as a robust geographical tracer of breeding origins of European bats by measuring δD in hair of five sedentary bat species from 45 locations throughout Europe. The δD of bat hair strongly correlated with well-established spatial isotopic patterns in mean annual precipitation in Europe, and therefore was highly correlated with latitude. We calculated a linear mixed-effects model, with species as random effect, linking δD of bat hair to precipitation δD of the areas of hair growth. This model can be used to predict breeding origins of European migrating bats. We used δ(13)C and δ(15)N to discriminate among potential origins of bats, and found that these isotopes can be used as variables to further refine origin predictions. A triple-isotope approach could thereby pinpoint populations or subpopulations that have distinct origins. Our results further corroborated stable isotope analysis as a powerful method to delineate animal migrations in Europe."
https://openalex.org/W2123797251,"To identify novel biomarkers for HIV-1 resistance, including pathways that may be critical in anti-HIV-1 vaccine design, we carried out a gene expression analysis on blood samples obtained from HIV-1 highly exposed seronegatives (HESN) from a commercial sex worker cohort in Nairobi and compared their profiles to HIV-1 negative controls. Whole blood samples were collected from 43 HIV-1 resistant sex workers and a similar number of controls. Total RNA was extracted and hybridized to the Affymetrix HUG 133 Plus 2.0 micro arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara CA). Output data was analysed through ArrayAssist software (Agilent, San Jose CA). More than 2,274 probe sets were differentially expressed in the HESN as compared to the control group (fold change ≥1.3; p value ≤0.0001, FDR <0.05). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the differentially expressed genes readily distinguished HESNs from controls. Pathway analysis through the KEGG signaling database revealed a majority of the impacted pathways (13 of 15, 87%) had genes that were significantly down regulated. The most down expressed pathways were glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate, phosphatidyl inositol, natural killer cell cytotoxicity and T-cell receptor signaling. Ribosomal protein synthesis and tight junction genes were up regulated. We infer that the hallmark of HIV-1 resistance is down regulation of genes in key signaling pathways that HIV-1 depends on for infection."
https://openalex.org/W2051697233,"Combining ability effects are very effective genetic parameters in deciding the next phase of breeding programs. Although some breeding strategies on the basis of evaluating combining ability have been utilized extensively in hybrid breeding, little is known about the genetic basis of combining ability. Combining ability is a complex trait that is controlled by polygenes. With the advent and development of molecular markers, it is feasible to evaluate the genetic bases of combining ability and heterosis of elite rice hybrids through QTL analysis.In the present study, we first developed a QTL-mapping method for dissecting combining ability and heterosis of agronomic traits. With three testcross populations and a BCRIL population in rice, biometric and QTL analyses were conducted for ten agronomic traits. The significance of general combining ability and special combining ability for most of the traits indicated the importance of both additive and non-additive effects on expression levels. A large number of additive effect QTLs associated with performance per se of BCRIL and general combining ability, and dominant effect QTLs associated with special combining ability and heterosis were identified for the ten traits.The combining ability of agronomic traits could be analyzed by the QTL mapping method. The characteristics revealed by the QTLs for combining ability of agronomic traits were similar with those by multitudinous QTLs for agronomic traits with performance per se of BCRIL. Several QTLs (1-6 in this study) were identified for each trait for combining ability. It demonstrated that some of the QTLs were pleiotropic or linked tightly with each other. The identification of QTLs responsible for combining ability and heterosis in the present study provides valuable information for dissecting genetic basis of combining ability."
https://openalex.org/W2027516897,"Background Vision and haptics are the key modalities by which humans perceive objects and interact with their environment in a target-oriented manner. Both modalities share higher-order neural resources and the mechanisms required for object exploration. Compared to vision, the understanding of haptic information processing is still rudimentary. Although it is known that haptic performance, similar to many other skills, decreases in old age, the underlying mechanisms are not clear. It is yet to be determined to what extent this decrease is related to the age-related loss of tactile acuity or cognitive capacity. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the haptic performance of 81 older adults by means of a cross-modal object recognition test. Additionally, we assessed the subjects' tactile acuity with an apparatus-based two-point discrimination paradigm, and their cognitive performance by means of the non-verbal Raven-Standard-Progressive matrices test. As expected, there was a significant age-related decline in performance on all 3 tests. With the exception of tactile acuity, this decline was found to be more distinct in female subjects. Correlation analyses revealed a strong relationship between haptic and cognitive performance for all subjects. Tactile performance, on the contrary, was only significantly correlated with male subjects' haptic performance. Conclusions Haptic object recognition is a demanding task in old age, especially when it comes to the exploration of complex, unfamiliar objects. Our data support a disproportionately higher impact of cognition on haptic performance as compared to the impact of tactile acuity. Our findings are in agreement with studies reporting an increase in co-variation between individual sensory performance and general cognitive functioning in old age."
https://openalex.org/W2121326081,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have long been believed to activate G proteins only on the cell surface. However, we have recently shown that, in thyroid cells, the GPCR for the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) can continue stimulating cAMP production after cointernalization with TSH. cAMP signaling by internalized TSH receptors (TSHRs) was persistent, whereas that by cell-surface TSHRs was apparently transient, but the reasons for the transient signaling by cell-surface TSHRs were not investigated. Here, we developed and used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based methods to precisely compare the kinetics of TSH binding and dissociation from cell-surface TSHRs with those of the subsequent termination of cAMP signaling directly in living cells. Our results indicate that both TSH binding to human TSHRs expressed in a human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK 293) and the ensuing cAMP signals are rapidly and fully reversible (t1/2,off=2.96±1.04 and 2.70±0.73 min, respectively). The FRET measurement of TSH binding was specific, as shown by the lack of a detectable interaction between TSH and the β2-adrenergic receptor expressed in control cells. Enhancing TSHR internalization by β-arrestin 2 overexpression did not modify the reversibility of TSHR-cAMP signaling. These findings strengthen the view that the cointernalization of TSH-TSHR complexes to a signaling compartment present in thyroid, but not in HEK 293 cells, is responsible for persistent cAMP signaling.—Werthmann, R.

https://openalex.org/W2171342914,"Phototropin is a light-regulated kinase that mediates a variety of photoresponses such as phototropism, chloroplast positioning, and stomata opening in plants to increase the photosynthetic efficiency. Blue light stimulus first induces local conformational changes in the chromophore-bearing light-oxygen and voltage 2 (LOV2) domain of phototropin, which in turn activates the serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinase domain in the C terminus. To examine the kinase activity of full-length phototropin conventionally, we employed the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this organism, Ser/Thr kinases (Fpk1p and Fpk2p) that show high sequence similarity to the kinase domain of phototropins exist. First, we demonstrated that the phototropin from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (CrPHOT) could complement loss of Fpk1p and Fpk2p to allow cell growth in yeast. Furthermore, this reaction was blue light-dependent, indicating that CrPHOT was indeed light-activated in yeast cells. We applied this system to a large scale screening for amino acid substitutions in CrPHOT that elevated the kinase activity in darkness. Consequently, we identified a cluster of mutations located in the N-terminal flanking region of LOV2 (R199C, L202L, D203N/G/V, L204P, T207I, and R210H). An in vitro phosphorylation assay confirmed that these mutations substantially reduced the repressive activity of LOV2 on the kinase domain in darkness. Furthermore, biochemical analyses of the representative T207I mutant demonstrated that the mutation affected neither spectral nor multimerization properties of CrPHOT. Hence, the N-terminal flanking region of LOV2, as is the case with the C-terminal flanking Jα region, appears to play a crucial role in the regulation of kinase activity in phototropin."
https://openalex.org/W2062814465,"Male killing, induced by different bacterial taxa of maternally inherited microorganisms, resulting in highly distorted female-biased sex-ratios, is a common phenomenon among arthropods. Some strains of the endosymbiont bacteria Wolbachia have been shown to induce this phenotype in particular insect hosts. High altitude populations of Drosophila bifasciata infected with Wolbachia show selective male killing during embryonic development. However, since this was first reported, circa 60 years ago, the interaction between Wolbachia and its host has remained unclear. Herein we show that D. bifasciata male embryos display defective chromatin remodeling, improper chromatid segregation and chromosome bridging, as well as abnormal mitotic spindles and gradual loss of their centrosomes. These defects occur at different times in the early development of male embryos leading to death during early nuclear division cycles or large defective areas of the cellular blastoderm, culminating in abnormal embryos that die before eclosion. We propose that Wolbachia affects the development of male embryos by specifically targeting male chromatin remodeling and thus disturbing mitotic spindle assembly and chromosome behavior. These are the first observations that demonstrate fundamental aspects of the cytological mechanism of male killing and represent a solid base for further molecular studies of this phenomenon."

In HIV infection, type I interferons may delay disease progression by inhibiting viral replication while at the same time accelerating disease progression by contributing to chronic immune activation.To investigate the effects of type I interferons in HIV-infection, we obtained cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from 10 subjects who participated in AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study 5192, a trial investigating the activity of systemic administration of IFNα for twelve weeks to patients with untreated HIV infection. Using flow cytometry, we examined changes in cell cycle status and expression of activation antigens by circulating T cells and their maturation subsets before, during and after IFNα treatment.The proportion of CD38+HLA-DR+CD8+ T cells increased from a mean of 11.7% at baseline to 24.1% after twelve weeks of interferon treatment (p = 0.006). These frequencies dropped to an average of 20.1% six weeks after the end of treatment. In contrast to CD8+ T cells, the frequencies of activated CD4+ T cells did not change with administration of type I interferon (mean percentage of CD38+DR+ cells = 2.62% at baseline and 2.17% after 12 weeks of interferon therapy). As plasma HIV levels fell with interferon therapy, this was correlated with a ""paradoxical"" increase in CD8+ T cell activation (p<0.001).Administration of type I interferon increased expression of the activation markers CD38 and HLA DR on CD8+ T cells but not on CD4+ T cells of HIV+ persons. These observations suggest that type I interferons may contribute to the high levels of CD8+ T cell activation that occur during HIV infection."

Following constitutive expression of reciprocal constructs, potentially capable of forming and reporting the presence of cell surface D(2long)-D(3) heteromers, individual clones were assessed for levels of expression of the constitutively expressed protomer. This was unaffected by induction of the partner protomer and the level of expression of the partner required to generate detectable cell surface D(2long)-D(3) heteromers was defined. Such homomers and heteromers were found to co-exist and using a reconstitution of function approach both homomers and heteromers of D(2long) and D(3) receptors were shown to be functional, potentially via trans-activation of associated G protein. These studies demonstrate the ability of dopamine D(2long) and D(3) receptors to form both homomers and heteromers, and show that in cells expressing each subtype a complex mixture of homomers and heteromers co-exists at steady state.

As sphingoid bases and their 1-phosphate are not only metabolic intermediates but also highly bioactive lipids that modulate a wide range of physiological processes, it would be predicted that their elevation might induce adjustments in other facets of sphingolipid metabolism and/or alter cell behavior. Indeed, we have previously reported that S1P lyase deficiency causes neurodegeneration and other adverse symptoms. We next asked the question whether and how S1P lyase deficiency affects the metabolism of (glyco)sphingolipids and cholesterol, two lipid classes that might be involved in the neurodegenerative processes observed in S1P lyase-deficient mice. As predicted, there was a considerable increase in free and phosphorylated sphingoid bases upon elimination of S1P lyase, but to our surprise, rather than increasing, the mass of (glyco)sphingolipids persisted at wild type levels. This was discovered to be due to reduced de novo sphingoid base biosynthesis and a corresponding increase in the recycling of the backbones via the salvage pathway. There was also a considerable increase in cholesterol esters, although free cholesterol persisted at wild type levels, which might be secondary to the shifts in sphingolipid metabolism. All in all, these findings show that accumulation of free and phosphorylated sphingoid bases by loss of S1P lyase causes an interesting readjustment of the balance between de novo biosynthesis and recycling to maintain (glyco)sphingolipid homeostasis.

Alveolar epithelial cells near areas of remodelling show an increased expression of proapoptotic molecules. Therefore, we investigated the role of genes involved in cell cycle control in IPF. Genotypes for five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the tumour protein 53 (TP53) gene and four SNPs in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A), the gene encoding p21, were determined in 77 IPF patients and 353 controls. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 16 healthy controls mRNA expression of TP53 and CDKN1A was determined. Rs12951053 and rs12602273, in TP53, were significantly associated with survival in IPF patients. Carriers of a minor allele had a 4-year survival of 22% versus 57% in the non-carrier group (p = 0.006). Rs2395655 and rs733590, in CDKN1A, were associated with an increased risk of developing IPF. In addition, the rs2395655 G allele correlated with progression of the disease as it increased the risk of a rapid decline in lung function. Functional experiments showed that rs733590 correlated significantly with CDKN1A mRNA expression levels in healthy controls. This is the first study to show that genetic variations in the cell cycle genes encoding p53 and p21 are associated with IPF disease development and progression. These findings support the idea that cell cycle control plays a role in the pathology of IPF. Variations in TP53 and CDKN1A can impair the response to cell damage and increase the loss of alveolar epithelial cells."

Although dendritic cells have been extensively studied, the ability of other APC types, such as B cells, to induce a CD8(+) T cell response have not been thoroughly evaluated.In this manuscript, we have characterized the ability of CD40-activated B cells, stimulated or not with Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists (CpG or lipopolysaccharide) to induce the response of mouse naïve CD8(+) T cells in vivo. Our results show that CD40-activated B cells can directly present antigen to naïve CD8(+) T cells to induce the generation of potent effectors able to secrete cytokines, kill target cells and control a Listeria monocytogenes infection. However, CD40-activated B cell immunization did not lead to the proper formation of CD8(+) memory T cells and further maturation of CD40-activated B cells with TLR agonists did not promote the development of CD8(+) memory T cells. Our results also suggest that inefficient generation of CD8(+) memory T cells with CD40-activated B cell immunization is a consequence of reduced Bcl-6 expression by effectors and enhanced contraction of the CD8(+) T cell response.Understanding why CD40-activated B cell immunization is defective for the generation of memory T cells and gaining new insights about signals that should be provided by APCs are key steps before translating the use of CD40-B cell for therapeutic vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2092102171,"An intriguing phenomenon in plant development is the timing and positioning of lateral organ initiation, which is a fundamental aspect of plant architecture. Although important progress has been made in elucidating the role of auxin transport in the vegetative shoot to explain the phyllotaxis of leaf formation in a spiral fashion, a model study of the role of auxin transport in whorled organ patterning in the expanding floral meristem is not available yet. We present an initial simulation approach to study the mechanisms that are expected to play an important role. Starting point is a confocal imaging study of Arabidopsis floral meristems at consecutive time points during flower development. These images reveal auxin accumulation patterns at the positions of the organs, which strongly suggests that the role of auxin in the floral meristem is similar to the role it plays in the shoot apical meristem. This is the basis for a simulation study of auxin transport through a growing floral meristem, which may answer the question whether auxin transport can in itself be responsible for the typical whorled floral pattern. We combined a cellular growth model for the meristem with a polar auxin transport model. The model predicts that sepals are initiated by auxin maxima arising early during meristem outgrowth. These form a pre-pattern relative to which a series of smaller auxin maxima are positioned, which partially overlap with the anlagen of petals, stamens, and carpels. We adjusted the model parameters corresponding to properties of floral mutants and found that the model predictions agree with the observed mutant patterns. The predicted timing of the primordia outgrowth and the timing and positioning of the sepal primordia show remarkable similarities with a developing flower in nature."
https://openalex.org/W1978787445,"Serine protease PRSS23 is a newly discovered protein that has been associated with tumor progression in various types of cancers. Interestingly, PRSS23 is coexpressed with estrogen receptor α (ERα), which is a prominent biomarker and therapeutic target for human breast cancer. Estrogen signaling through ERα is also known to affect cell proliferation, apoptosis, and survival, which promotes tumorigenesis by regulating the production of numerous downstream effector proteins. In the present study, we aimed to clarify the correlation between and functional implication of ERα and PRSS23 in breast cancer. Analysis of published breast cancer microarray datasets revealed that the gene expression correlation between ERα and PRSS23 is highly significant among all ERα-associated proteases in breast cancer. We then assessed PRSS23 expression in 56 primary breast cancer biopsies and 8 cancer cell lines. The results further confirmed the coexpression of PRSS23 and ERα and provided clinicopathological significance. In vitro assays in MCF-7 breast cancer cells demonstrated that PRSS23 expression is induced by 17β-estradiol-activated ERα through an interaction with an upstream promoter region of PRSS23 gene. In addition, PRSS23 knockdown may suppress estrogen-driven cell proliferation of MCF-7 cells. Our findings imply that PRSS23 might be a critical component of estrogen-mediated cell proliferation of ERα-positive breast cancer cells. In conclusion, the present study highlights the potential for PRSS23 to be a novel therapeutic target in breast cancer research."
https://openalex.org/W2019336708,"Background Monitoring of the uptake and efficacy of ART in a population often relies on cross-sectional data, providing limited information that could be used to design specific targeted intervention programs. Using repeated measures of viral load (VL) surveillance data, we aimed to estimate and characterize the proportion of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in New York City (NYC) with sustained high VL (SHVL) and durably suppressed VL (DSVL). Methods/Principal Findings Retrospective cohort study of all persons reported to the NYC HIV Surveillance Registry who were alive and ≥12 years old by the end of 2005 and who had ≥2 VL tests in 2006 and 2007. SHVL and DSVL were defined as PLWHA with 2 consecutive VLs ≥100,000 copies/mL and PLWHA with all VLs ≤400 copies/mL, respectively. Logistic regression models using generalized estimating equations were used to model the association between SHVL and covariates. There were 56,836 PLWHA, of whom 7% had SHVL and 38% had DSVL. Compared to those without SHVL, persons with SHVL were more likely to be younger, black and have injection drug use (IDU) risk. PLWHA with SHVL were more likely to die by 2007 and be younger by nearly ten years, on average. Conclusions/Significance Nearly 60% of PLWHA in 2005 had multiple VLs, of whom almost 40% had DSVL, suggesting successful ART uptake. A small proportion had SHVL, representing groups known to have suboptimal engagement in care. This group should be targeted for additional outreach to reduce morbidity and secondary transmission. Measures based on longitudinal analyses of surveillance data in conjunction with cross-sectional measures such as community viral load represent more precise and powerful tools for monitoring ART effectiveness and potential impact on disease transmission than cross-sectional measures alone."
https://openalex.org/W1963660847,"The enzymes responsible for the rate-limiting step in retinoic acid biosynthesis, the oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde, during embryogenesis and in adulthood have not been fully defined. Here, we report that a novel member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily, frog sdr16c5, acts as a highly active retinol dehydrogenase (rdhe2) that promotes retinoic acid biosynthesis when expressed in mammalian cells. In vivo assays of rdhe2 function show that overexpression of rdhe2 in frog embryos leads to posteriorization and induction of defects resembling those caused by retinoic acid toxicity. Conversely, antisense morpholino-mediated knockdown of endogenous rdhe2 results in phenotypes consistent with retinoic acid deficiency, such as defects in anterior neural tube closure, microcephaly with small eye formation, disruption of somitogenesis, and curved body axis with bent tail. Higher doses of morpholino induce embryonic lethality. Analyses of retinoic acid levels using either endogenous retinoic acid-sensitive gene hoxd4 or retinoic acid reporter cell line both show that the levels of retinoic acid are significantly decreased in rdhe2 morphants. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that Xenopus rdhe2 functions as a retinol dehydrogenase essential for frog embryonic development in vivo. Importantly, the retinol oxidizing activity of frog rdhe2 is conserved in its mouse homologs, suggesting that rdhe2-related enzymes may represent the previously unrecognized physiologically relevant retinol dehydrogenases that contribute to retinoic acid biosynthesis in higher vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W2002922829,"Patients diagnosed with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus have similar levels of neuropsychological dysfunction (i.e., 20-50%) as those with Neuropsychiatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (NPSLE). We hypothesized a gradient between cognition and white matter integrity, such that strongest brain-behavior relationships would emerge in NPSLE, intermediate in non-NPSLE, and minimal in controls. We studied thirty-one patients (16 non-NPSLE; 15 NPSLE), ranging in age from 18 to 59 years old (100% female), and eighteen age and gender matched healthy controls. DTI examinations were performed on a 1.5T scanner. A broad neuropsychological battery was administered, tapping attention, memory, processing speed, and executive functioning. The Total z-score consisted of the combined sum of all neuropsychological measures. In control subjects, we found no significant FA-Total z-score correlations. NPSLE, non-NPSLE, and control subjects differed significantly in terms of Total z-score (NPSLE = -2.25+/-1.77, non-NPSLE = -1.22+/-1.03, Controls = -0.10+/-.57; F = 13.2, p<.001). In non-NPSLE subjects, FA within the right external capsule was significantly correlated with Total z-score. In NPSLE subjects, the largest FA-Total z-score clusters were observed within the left anterior thalamic radiation and right superior longitudinal fasciculus. In subsequent analyses the largest number of significant voxels linked FA with the Processing Speed z-score in NPSLE. The current results reflect objective white matter correlates of neuropsychological dysfunction in both NPSLE and (to a lesser degree) in non-NPSLE. non-NPSLE and NPSLE subjects did not differ significantly in terms of depression, as measured by the GDI; thus, previous hypotheses suggesting moderating effects of depression upon neuropsychological performance do not impact the current FA results."
https://openalex.org/W2091477302,"Chagas disease is caused by infection with the intracellular protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. At present, nifurtimox and benznidazole, both compounds developed empirically over four decades ago, represent the chemotherapeutic arsenal for treating this highly neglected disease. However, both drugs present variable efficacy depending on the geographical area and the occurrence of natural resistance, and are poorly effective against the later chronic stage. As a part of a search for new therapeutic opportunities to treat chagasic patients, pre-clinical studies were performed to characterize the activity of a novel arylimidamide (AIA--DB1831 (hydrochloride salt) and DB1965 (mesylate salt)) against T. cruzi. These AIAs displayed a high trypanocidal effect in vitro against both relevant forms in mammalian hosts, exhibiting a high selectivity index and a very high efficacy (IC(50) value/48 h of 5-40 nM) against intracellular parasites. DB1965 shows high activity in vivo in acute experimental models (mouse) of T. cruzi, showing a similar effect to benznidazole (Bz) when compared under a scheme of 10 daily consecutive doses with 12.5 mg/kg. Although no parasitological cure was observed after treating with 20 daily consecutive doses, a combined dosage of DB1965 (5 mg/kg) with Bz (50 mg/kg) resulted in parasitaemia clearance and 100% animal survival. In summary, our present data confirmed that aryimidamides represent promising new chemical entities against T. cruzi in therapeutic schemes using the AIA alone or in combination with other drugs, like benznidazole."
https://openalex.org/W1988615218,"The effect of glycemic control after starting peritoneal dialysis (PD) on the survival of diabetic PD patients has largely been unexplored, especially in Asian population.We conducted a prospective observational study, in which 140 incident PD patients with diabetes were recruited. Patients were divided into tertiles according to the means of quarterly HbA1C levels measured during the first year after starting PD. We examined the association between HbA1C and all-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazards models.The mean age was 58.7 years, 59.3% were male, and the mean follow-up duration was 3.5 years (range 0.4-9.5 years). The mean HbA1C levels were 6.3%, 7.1%, and 8.5% in the 1(st), 2(nd), and 3(rd) tertiles, respectively. Compared to the 1(st) tertile, the all-cause mortality rates were higher in the 2(nd) [hazard ratio (HR), 4.16; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.91-18.94; p = 0.065] and significantly higher in the 3(rd) (HR, 13.16; 95% CI, 2.67-64.92; p = 0.002) tertiles (p for trend = 0.005), after adjusting for confounding factors. Cardiovascular mortality, however, did not differ significantly among the tertiles (p for trend = 0.682). In contrast, non-cardiovascular deaths, most of which were caused by infection, were more frequent in the 2(nd) (HR, 7.67; 95% CI, 0.68-86.37; p = 0.099) and the 3(rd) (HR, 51.24; 95% CI, 3.85-681.35; p = 0.003) tertiles than the 1(st) tertile (p for trend = 0.007).Poor glycemic control is associated with high mortality rates in diabetic PD patients, suggesting that better glycemic control may improve the outcomes of these patients."
https://openalex.org/W2143009360,"Iron is essential for the survival of almost all bacteria. Vibrio cholerae acquires iron through the secretion of a catecholate siderophore called vibriobactin. At present, how vibriobactin chelates ferric ion remains controversial. In addition, the mechanisms underlying the recognition of ferric vibriobactin by the siderophore transport system and its delivery into the cytoplasm specifically have not been clarified. In this study, we report the high-resolution structures of the ferric vibriobactin periplasmic binding protein ViuP and its complex with ferric vibriobactin. The holo-ViuP structure reveals that ferric vibriobactin does not adopt the same iron coordination as that of other catecholate siderophores such as enterobactin. The three catechol moieties donate five, rather than six, oxygen atoms as iron ligands. The sixth iron ligand is provided by a nitrogen atom from the second oxazoline ring. This kind of iron coordination results in the protrusion of the second catechol moiety and renders the electrostatic surface potential of ferric vibriobactin less negatively polarized compared with ferric enterobactin. To accommodate ferric vibriobactin, ViuP has a deeper subpocket to hold the protrusion of the second catechol group. This structural characteristic has not been observed in other catecholate siderophore-binding proteins. Biochemical data show that siderocalin, which is part of the mammalian innate immune system, cannot efficiently sequester ferric vibriobactin in vitro, although it can capture many catecholate siderophores with high efficiency. Our findings suggest that the unique iron coordination found in ferric vibriobactin may be utilized by some pathogenic bacteria to evade the siderocalin-mediated innate immune response of mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2148922748,"The sulfonylurea receptor SUR1 associates with Kir6.2 or Kir6.1 to form K(ATP) channels, which link metabolism to excitability in multiple cell types. The strong physical coupling of SUR1 with Kir6 subunits appears exclusive, but recent studies argue that SUR1 also modulates TRPM4, a member of the transient receptor potential family of non-selective cation channels. It has been reported that, following stroke, brain, or spinal cord injury, SUR1 is increased in neurovascular cells at the site of injury. This is accompanied by up-regulation of a non-selective cation conductance with TRPM4-like properties and apparently sensitive to sulfonylureas, leading to the postulation that post-traumatic non-selective cation currents are determined by TRPM4/SUR1 channels. To investigate the mechanistic hypothesis for the coupling between TRPM4 and SUR1, we performed electrophysiological and FRET studies in COSm6 cells expressing TRPM4 channels with or without SUR1. TRPM4-mediated currents were Ca(2+)-activated, voltage-dependent, underwent desensitization, and were inhibited by ATP but were insensitive to glibenclamide and tolbutamide. These properties were not affected by cotransfection with SUR1. When the same SUR1 was cotransfected with Kir6.2, functional K(ATP) channels were formed. In cells cotransfected with Kir6.2, SUR1, and TRPM4, we measured K(ATP)-mediated K(+) currents and Ca(2+)-activated, sulfonylurea-insensitive Na(+) currents in the same patch, further showing that SUR1 controls K(ATP) channel activity but not TRPM4 channels. FRET signal between fluorophore-tagged TRPM4 subunits was similar to that between Kir6.2 and SUR1, whereas there was no detectable FRET efficiency between TRPM4 and SUR1. Our data suggest that functional or structural association of TRPM4 and SUR1 is unlikely."
https://openalex.org/W1994877856,"Primary HIV infection is usually caused by R5 viruses, and there is an association between the emergence of CCXR4-utilizing strains and faster disease progression. We characterized HIV-1 from a cohort of recently infected individuals in Brazil, predicted the virus's co-receptor use based on the env genotype and attempted to correlate virus profiles with disease progression.A total of 72 recently infected HIV patients were recruited based on the Serologic Testing Algorithm for Recent HIV Seroconversion and were followed every three to four months for up to 78 weeks. The HIV-1 V3 region was characterized by sequencing nine to twelve weeks after enrollment. Disease progression was characterized by CD4+ T-cell count decline to levels consistently below 350 cells/µL.Twelve out of 72 individuals (17%) were predicted to harbor CXCR4-utilizing strains; a baseline CD4<350 was more frequent among these individuals (p = 0.03). Fifty-seven individuals that were predicted to have CCR5-utilizing viruses and 10 individuals having CXCR4-utilizing strains presented with baseline CD4>350; after 78 weeks, 33 individuals with CCR5 strains and one individual with CXCR4 strains had CD4>350 (p = 0.001). There was no association between CD4 decline and demographic characteristics or HIV-1 subtype.Our findings confirm the presence of strains with higher in vitro pathogenicity during early HIV infection, suggesting that even among recently infected individuals, rapid progression may be a consequence of the early emergence of CXCR4-utilizing strains. Characterizing the HIV-1 V3 region by sequencing may be useful in predicting disease progression and guiding treatment initiation decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2143000971,"The ascomycete fungus Fusarium fujikuroi (Gibberella fujikuroi MP-C) produces secondary metabolites of biotechnological interest, such as gibberellins, bikaverin, and carotenoids. Production of these metabolites is regulated by nitrogen availability and, in a specific manner, by other environmental signals, such as light in the case of the carotenoid pathway. A complex regulatory network controlling these processes is recently emerging from the alterations of metabolite production found through the mutation of different regulatory genes. Here we show the effect of the targeted mutation of the acyA gene of F. fujikuroi, coding for adenylyl cyclase. Mutants lacking the catalytic domain of the AcyA protein showed different phenotypic alterations, including reduced growth, enhanced production of unidentified red pigments, reduced production of gibberellins and partially derepressed carotenoid biosynthesis in the dark. The phenotype differs in some aspects from that of similar mutants of the close relatives F. proliferatum and F. verticillioides: contrary to what was observed in these species, ΔacyA mutants of F. fujikuroi showed enhanced sensitivity to oxidative stress (H(2)O(2)), but no change in heavy metal resistance or in the ability to colonize tomato tissue, indicating a high versatility in the regulatory roles played by cAMP in this fungal group."
https://openalex.org/W2145236408,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) plays a major role in pathophysiology. Our previous studies demonstrated that the VIP sequence 6-28 interacts with the N-terminal ectodomain (N-ted) of its receptor, VPAC1. Probes for VIP and receptor antagonist PG97-269 were synthesized with a photolabile residue/Bpa at various positions and used to explore spatial proximity with VPAC1. PG97-269 probes with Bpa at position 0, 6, and 24 behaved as high-affinity receptor antagonists (Ki=12, 9, and 7 nM, respectively). Photolabeling experiments revealed that the [Bpa0]-VIP probe was in physical contact with VPAC1 Q135, while [Bpa0]-PG97-269 was covalently bound to G62 residue of N-ted, indicating different binding sites. In contrast, photolabeling with [Bpa6]- and [Bpa24]-PG97-269 showed that the distal domains of PG97-269 interacted with N-ted, as we previously showed for VIP. Substitution with alanine of the K143, T144, and T147 residues located in the first transmembrane domain of VPAC1 induced a loss of receptor affinity (IC50=1035, 874, and 2070 nM, respectively), and pharmacological studies using VIP2-28 indicated that these three residues play an important role in VPAC1 interaction with the first histidine residue of VIP. These data demonstrate that VIP and PG97-269 bind to distinct domains of VPAC1.—Ceraudo, E., Hierso, R., Tan, Y.-V., Murail, S., Rouyer-Fessard C., Nicole, P., Robert, J.-C., Jamin, N., Neumann, J.-M., Robberecht, P., Laburthe, M., Couvineau, A.

https://openalex.org/W2050349807,"Numerous studies using cultured mammalian cells have shown that the three GGAs (Golgi-localized, gamma-ear containing, ADP-ribosylation factor- binding proteins) function in the transport of cargo proteins between the trans- Golgi network and endosomes. However, the in vivo role(s) of these adaptor proteins and their possible functional redundancy has not been analyzed. In this study, the genes encoding GGAs1-3 were disrupted in mice by insertional mutagenesis. Loss of GGA1 or GGA3 alone was well tolerated whereas the absence of GGA2 resulted in embryonic or neonatal lethality, depending on the genetic background of the mice. Thus, GGA2 mediates a vital function that cannot be compensated for by GGA1and/or GGA3. The combined loss of GGA1 and GGA3 also resulted in a high incidence of neonatal mortality but in this case the expression level of GGA2 may be inadequate to compensate for the loss of the other two GGAs. We conclude that the three mammalian GGAs are essential proteins that are not fully redundant."
https://openalex.org/W2062226935,"Congenital hydrocephalus (CH) is a life-threatening medical condition in which excessive accumulation of CSF leads to ventricular expansion and increased intracranial pressure. Stenosis (blockage) of the Sylvian aqueduct (Aq; the narrow passageway that connects the third and fourth ventricles) is a common form of CH in humans, although the genetic basis of this condition is unknown. Mouse models of CH indicate that Aq stenosis is associated with abnormal development of the subcommmissural organ (SCO) a small secretory organ located at the dorsal midline of the caudal diencephalon. Glycoproteins secreted by the SCO generate Reissner's fibre (RF), a thread-like structure that descends into the Aq and is thought to maintain its patency. However, despite the importance of SCO function in CSF homeostasis, the genetic program that controls SCO development is poorly understood. Here, we show that the X-linked transcription factor SOX3 is expressed in the murine SCO throughout its development and in the mature organ. Importantly, overexpression of Sox3 in the dorsal diencephalic midline of transgenic mice induces CH via a dose-dependent mechanism. Histological, gene expression and cellular proliferation studies indicate that Sox3 overexpression disrupts the development of the SCO primordium through inhibition of diencephalic roof plate identity without inducing programmed cell death. This study provides further evidence that SCO function is essential for the prevention of hydrocephalus and indicates that overexpression of Sox3 in the dorsal midline alters progenitor cell differentiation in a dose-dependent manner."

Here we report that between close relatives, a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders covary strongly with intellectual interests. We surveyed an entire class of high-functioning young adults at an elite university for prospective major, familial incidence of neuropsychiatric disorders, and demographic and attitudinal questions. Students aspiring to technical majors (science/mathematics/engineering) were more likely than other students to report a sibling with an autism spectrum disorder (p = 0.037). Conversely, students interested in the humanities were more likely to report a family member with major depressive disorder (p = 8.8×10(-4)), bipolar disorder (p = 0.027), or substance abuse problems (p = 1.9×10(-6)). A combined PREdisposition for Subject MattEr (PRESUME) score based on these disorders was strongly predictive of subject matter interests (p = 9.6×10(-8)).

https://openalex.org/W1965331149,"Background Impulsivity refers to a wide spectrum of actions characterized by quick and nonplanned reactions to external and internal stimuli, without taking into account the possible negative consequences for the individual or others, and decision-making is one of the biologically dissociated impulsive behaviors. Changes in impulsivity may be associated with norepinephrine. Various populations of drug addicts all performed impulsive decision making, which is a key risk factor in drug dependence and relapse. The present study investigated the effects of clonidine, which decreased norepinephrine release through presynaptic alpha-2 receptor activation, on the impaired decision-making performance in abstinent heroin addicts. Methodology/Principal Findings Decision-making performance was assessed using the original version of Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Both heroin addicts and normal controls were randomly assigned to three groups receiving clonidine, 0, 75 µg or 150 µg orally under double blind conditions. Psychiatric symptoms, including anxiety, depression and impulsivity, were rated on standardized scales. Heroin addicts reported higher scores on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale and exhibited impaired decision-making on the IGT. A single high-dose of clonidine improved the decision-making performance in heroin addicts. Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest clonidine may have a potential therapeutic role in heroin addicts by improving the impaired impulsive decision-making. The current findings have important implications for behavioral and pharmacological interventions targeting decision-making in heroin addiction."

Exploration of E. coli KdpE(DBD) and kdpFABC(BS) interaction resulted in the identification of two conserved, AT-rich 6 bp direct repeats that form half-sites. Despite binding to these half-sites, KdpE(DBD) was incapable of promoting gene expression in vivo. Structure-function studies guided by our 2.5 Å X-ray structure of KdpE(DBD) revealed the importance of residues R193 and R200 in the α-8 DNA recognition helix and T215 in the wing region for DNA binding. Mutation of these residues renders KdpE incapable of inducing expression of the kdpFABC operon. Detailed biophysical analysis of interactions using analytical ultracentrifugation revealed a 2∶1 stoichiometry of protein to DNA with dissociation constants of 200±100 and 350±100 nM at half-sites. Inactivation of one half-site does not influence binding at the other, indicating that KdpE(DBD) binds independently to the half-sites with approximately equal affinity and no discernable cooperativity. To our knowledge, these data are the first to describe in quantitative terms the binding at half-sites under equilibrium conditions for a member of the ubiquitous OmpR/PhoB family of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2072261794,"Recent studies suggest that SOCS2 is involved in the regulation of TLR signaling. In this study, we found that the expression of SOCS2 is regulated in human monocyte-derived DC by ligands stimulating TLR2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 9 signaling. SOCS2 induction by LPS was dependent on the type I IFN regulated transcription factors IRF1 and IRF3 as shown by using silencing RNAs for IRFs. Blocking endogenous type I IFN signaling, by neutralizing antibodies to the receptor IFNAR2, abolished SOCS2 mRNA expression after TLR4 stimulation. Transcription factors STAT3, 5 and 6 displayed putative binding sites in the promoter regions of the human SOCS2 gene. Subsequent silencing experiments further supported that STAT3 and STAT5 are involved in LPS induced SOCS2 regulation. In mice we show that SOCS2 mRNA induction is 45% lower in bone marrow derived macrophages derived from MyD88−/− mice, and do not increase in BMMs from IRF3−/− mice after BCG infection. In conclusion, our results suggest that TLR4 signaling indirectly increases SOCS2 in late phase mainly via the production of endogenous type I IFN, and that subsequent IFN receptor signaling activates SOCS2 via STAT3 and STAT5."
https://openalex.org/W2037052050,"Although its role is frequently stressed in acoustic profile for vocal emotion, sound intensity is frequently regarded as a control parameter in neurocognitive studies of vocal emotion, leaving its role and neural underpinnings unclear. To investigate these issues, we asked participants to rate the angry level of neutral and angry prosodies before and after sound intensity modification in Experiment 1, and recorded electroencephalogram (EEG) for mismatching emotional prosodies with and without sound intensity modification and for matching emotional prosodies while participants performed emotional feature or sound intensity congruity judgment in Experiment 2. It was found that sound intensity modification had significant effect on the rating of angry level for angry prosodies, but not for neutral ones. Moreover, mismatching emotional prosodies, relative to matching ones, induced enhanced N2/P3 complex and theta band synchronization irrespective of sound intensity modification and task demands. However, mismatching emotional prosodies with reduced sound intensity showed prolonged peak latency and decreased amplitude in N2/P3 complex and smaller theta band synchronization. These findings suggest that though it cannot categorically affect emotionality conveyed in emotional prosodies, sound intensity contributes to emotional significance quantitatively, implying that sound intensity should not simply be taken as a control parameter and its unique role needs to be specified in vocal emotion studies."
https://openalex.org/W1972579409,"The GDI1 gene encodes αGDI, which retrieves inactive GDP-bound RAB from membranes to form a cytosolic pool awaiting vesicular release. Mutations in GDI1 are responsible for X-linked Intellectual Disability. Characterization of the Gdi1-null mice has revealed alterations in the total number and distribution of hippocampal and cortical synaptic vesicles, hippocampal short-term synaptic plasticity and specific short-term memory deficits in adult mice, which are possibly caused by alterations of different synaptic vesicle recycling pathways controlled by several RAB GTPases. However, interpretation of these studies is complicated by the complete ablation of Gdi1 in all cells in the brain throughout development. In this study, we generated conditionally gene-targeted mice in which the knockout of Gdi1 is restricted to the forebrain, hippocampus, cortex and amygdala and occurs only during postnatal development. Adult mutant mice reproduce the short-term memory deficit previously reported in Gdi1-null mice. Surprisingly, the delayed ablation of Gdi1 worsens the pre-synaptic phenotype at cortico-amygdala synaptic connections compared to Gdi1-null mice. These results suggest a pivotal role of αGDI via specific RAB GTPases acting specifically in forebrain regions at the pre-synaptic sites involved in memory formation."
https://openalex.org/W2172095464,"Background Causes and consequences of the complex changes in lipids occurring in the metabolic syndrome are only partly understood. Several interconnected processes are deteriorating, which implies that multi-target approaches might be more successful than strategies based on a limited number of surrogate markers. Preparations from Chinese Medicine (CM) systems have been handed down with documented clinical features similar as metabolic syndrome, which might help developing new intervention for metabolic syndrome. The progress in systems biology and specific animal models created possibilities to assess the effects of such preparations. Here we report the plasma and liver lipidomics results of the intervention effects of a preparation SUB885C in apolipoprotein E3 Leiden cholesteryl ester transfer protein (ApoE*3Leiden.CETP) mice. SUB885C was developed according to the principles of CM for treatment of metabolic syndrome. The cannabinoid receptor type 1 blocker rimonabant was included as a general control for the evaluation of weight and metabolic responses. Methodology/Principal Findings ApoE*3Leiden.CETP mice with mild hypercholesterolemia were divided into SUB885C-, rimonabant- and non-treated control groups. SUB885C caused no weight loss, but significantly reduced plasma cholesterol (−49%, p<0.001), CETP levels (−31%, p<0.001), CETP activity (−74%, p<0.001) and increased HDL-C (39%, p<0.05). It influenced lipidomics classes of cholesterol esters and triglycerides the most. Rimonabant induced a weight loss (−9%, p<0.05), but only a moderate improvement of lipid profiles. In vitro, SUB885C extract caused adipolysis stimulation and adipogenesis inhibition in 3T3-L1 cells. Conclusions SUB885C, a multi-components preparation, is able to produce anti-atherogenic changes in lipids of the ApoE*3Leiden.CETP mice, which are comparable to those obtained with compounds belonging to known drugs (e.g. rimonabant, atorvastatin, niacin). This study successfully illustrated the power of lipidomics in unraveling intervention effects and to help finding new targets or ingredients for lifestyle-related metabolic abnormality."
https://openalex.org/W1968557962,"Background High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) treatment can eliminate cholesteatoma cells from explanted human ossicles prior to re-insertion. We analyzed the effects of HHP treatment on the microbial flora on ossicles and on the planktonic and biofilm states of selected isolates. Methodology Twenty-six ossicles were explanted from cholesteatoma patients. Five ossicles were directly analyzed for microbial growth without further treatment. Fifteen ossicles were cut into two pieces. One piece was exposed to HHP of 350 MPa for 10 minutes. Both the treated and untreated (control) pieces were then assessed semi-quantitatively. Three ossicles were cut into two pieces and exposed to identical pressure conditions with or without the addition of one of two different combinations of antibiotics to the medium. Differential effects of 10-minute in vitro exposure of planktonic and biofilm bacteria to pressures of 100 MPa, 250 MPa, 400 MPa and 540 MPa in isotonic and hypotonic media were analyzed using two patient isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Neisseria subflava. Bacterial cell inactivation and biofilm destruction were assessed by colony counting and electron microscopy. Principal Findings A variety of microorganisms were isolated from the ossicles. Irrespective of the medium, HHP treatment at 350 MPa for 10 minutes led to satisfying but incomplete inactivation especially of Gram-negative bacteria. The addition of antibiotics increased the efficacy of elimination. A comparison of HHP treatment of planktonic and biofilm cells showed that the effects of HPP were reduced by about one decadic logarithmic unit when HPP was applied to biofilms. High hydrostatic pressure conditions that are suitable to inactivate cholesteatoma cells fail to completely sterilize ossicles even if antibiotics are added. As a result of the reduced microbial load and the viability loss of surviving bacteria, however, there is a lower risk of re-infection after re-insertion."

https://openalex.org/W2132533571,"A pivotal role is attributed to the estrogen-receptor (ER) pathway in mediating the effect of estrogen in breast cancer progression. Yet the precise mechanisms of cancer development by estrogen remain poorly understood. Advancing tumor categorization a step forward, and identifying cellular gene fingerprints to accompany histopathological assessment may provide targets for therapy as well as vehicles for evaluating the response to treatment. We report here that in breast carcinoma, estrogen may induce tumor development by eliciting protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) gene expression. Induction of PAR1 was shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, luciferase reporter gene driven by the hPar1 promoter, and chromatin-immunoprecipitation analyses. Functional estrogen regulation of hPar1 in breast cancer was demonstrated by an endothelial tube-forming network. Notably, tissue-microarray analyses from an established cohort of women diagnosed with invasive breast carcinoma exhibited a significantly shorter disease-free (P= 0.006) and overall (P=0.02) survival of patients that were positive for ER and PAR1, compared to ER-positive but PAR1-negative patients. We propose that estrogen transcriptionally regulates hPar1, culminating in an aggressive gene imprint in breast cancer. While ER+ patients are traditionally treated with hormone therapy, the presence of PAR1 identifies a group of patients that requires additional treatment, such as anti-PAR1 biological vehicles or chemotherapy.—Salah, Z., Uziely, B., Jaber, M., Maoz, M., Cohen, I., Hamburger, T., Maly, B., Peretz, T., B.-S, R.

https://openalex.org/W2005137031,"It is still not clear how prebiotic replicators evolved towards the complexity found in present day organisms. Within the most realistic scenario for prebiotic evolution, known as the RNA world hypothesis, such complexity has arisen from replicators consisting solely of RNA. Within contemporary life, remarkably many RNAs are involved in modifying other RNAs. In hindsight, such RNA-RNA modification might have helped in alleviating the limits of complexity posed by the information threshold for RNA-only replicators. Here we study the possible role of such self-modification in early evolution, by modeling the evolution of protocells as evolving replicators, which have the opportunity to incorporate these mechanisms as a molecular tool. Evolution is studied towards a set of 25 arbitrary 'functional' structures, while avoiding all other (misfolded) structures, which are considered to be toxic and increase the death-rate of a protocell. The modeled protocells contain a genotype of different RNA-sequences while their phenotype is the ensemble of secondary structures they can potentially produce from these RNA-sequences. One of the secondary structures explicitly codes for a simple sequence-modification tool. This 'RNA-adapter' can block certain positions on other RNA-sequences through antisense base-pairing. The altered sequence can produce an alternative secondary structure, which may or may not be functional. We show that the modifying potential of interacting RNA-sequences enables these protocells to evolve high fitness under high mutation rates. Moreover, our model shows that because of toxicity of misfolded molecules, redundant coding impedes the evolution of self-modification machinery, in effect restraining the evolvability of coding structures. Hence, high mutation rates can actually promote the evolution of complex coding structures by reducing redundant coding. Protocells can successfully use RNA-adapters to modify their genotype-phenotype mapping in order to enhance the coding capacity of their genome and fit more information on smaller sized genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2079131580,"Cells respond to changes in the internal and external environment by a complex regulatory system whose end-point is the activation of transcription factors controlling the expression of a pool of ad-hoc genes. Recent experiments have shown that certain stimuli may trigger oscillations in the concentration of transcription factors such as NF-B and p53 influencing the final outcome of the genetic response. In this study we investigate the role of oscillations in the case of three different well known gene regulatory mechanisms using mathematical models based on ordinary differential equations and numerical simulations. We considered the cases of direct regulation, two-step regulation and feed-forward loops, and characterized their response to oscillatory input signals both analytically and numerically. We show that in the case of indirect two-step regulation the expression of genes can be turned on or off in a frequency dependent manner, and that feed-forward loops are also able to selectively respond to the temporal profile of oscillating transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2087090187,"Sumoylation is a highly dynamic process that plays a role in a multitude of processes ranging from cell cycle progression to mRNA processing and cancer. A previous study from our lab demonstrated that SUMO plays an important role in keratinocyte differentiation. Here we present a new method of tracking the sumoylation state of proteins by creating a stably transfected HaCaT keratinocyte cell line expressing an inducible SNAP-SUMO3 protein. The SNAP-tag allows covalent fluorescent labeling that is denaturation resistant. When combined with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the SNAP-tag technology provides direct visualization of sumoylated targets and can be used to follow temporal changes in the global cohort of sumoylated proteins during dynamic processes such as differentiation. HaCaT keratinocyte cells expressing SNAP-SUMO3 displayed normal morphological and biochemical features that are consistent with typical keratinocyte differentiation. SNAP-SUMO3 also localized normally in these cells with a predominantly nuclear signal and some minor cytoplasmic staining, consistent with previous reports for untagged SUMO2/3. During keratinocyte differentiation the total number of proteins modified by SNAP-SUMO3 was highest in basal cells, decreased abruptly after induction of differentiation, and slowly rebounded beginning between 48 and 72 hours as differentiation progressed. However, within this overall trend the pattern of change for individual sumoylated proteins was highly variable with both increases and decreases in amount over time. From these results we conclude that sumoylation of proteins during keratinocyte differentiation is a complex process which likely reflects and contributes to the biochemical changes that drive differentiation."
