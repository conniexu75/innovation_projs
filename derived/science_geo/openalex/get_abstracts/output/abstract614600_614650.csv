https://openalex.org/W2884903585,"Ploidy abnormalities are a hallmark of cancer, but their impact on the evolution and outcomes of cancers is unknown. Here, we identified whole-genome doubling (WGD) in the tumors of nearly 30% of 9,692 prospectively sequenced advanced cancer patients. WGD varied by tumor lineage and molecular subtype, and arose early in carcinogenesis after an antecedent transforming driver mutation. While associated with TP53 mutations, 46% of all WGD arose in TP53-wild-type tumors and in such cases was associated with an E2F-mediated G1 arrest defect, although neither aberration was obligate in WGD tumors. The variability of WGD across cancer types can be explained in part by cancer cell proliferation rates. WGD predicted for increased morbidity across cancer types, including KRAS-mutant colorectal cancers and estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers, independently of established clinical prognostic factors. We conclude that WGD is highly common in cancer and is a macro-evolutionary event associated with poor prognosis across cancer types."

https://openalex.org/W2883945062,"Key challenges for human genetics, precision medicine and evolutionary biology include deciphering the regulatory code of gene expression and understanding the transcriptional effects of genome variation. However, this is extremely difficult because of the enormous scale of the noncoding mutation space. We developed a deep learning–based framework, ExPecto, that can accurately predict, ab initio from a DNA sequence, the tissue-specific transcriptional effects of mutations, including those that are rare or that have not been observed. We prioritized causal variants within disease- or trait-associated loci from all publicly available genome-wide association studies and experimentally validated predictions for four immune-related diseases. By exploiting the scalability of ExPecto, we characterized the regulatory mutation space for human RNA polymerase II–transcribed genes by in silico saturation mutagenesis and profiled > 140 million promoter-proximal mutations. This enables probing of evolutionary constraints on gene expression and ab initio prediction of mutation disease effects, making ExPecto an end-to-end computational framework for the in silico prediction of expression and disease risk. ExPecto is a deep learning–based framework that can predict the tissue-specific transcriptional effects of mutations on the basis of DNA sequence alone. ExPecto can prioritize causal variants from GWAS loci and be used to predict the disease risk of a variant."
https://openalex.org/W2863731766,"As global temperatures rise, large amounts of carbon sequestered in permafrost are becoming available for microbial degradation. Accurate prediction of carbon gas emissions from thawing permafrost is limited by our understanding of these microbial communities. Here we use metagenomic sequencing of 214 samples from a permafrost thaw gradient to recover 1,529 metagenome-assembled genomes, including many from phyla with poor genomic representation. These genomes reflect the diversity of this complex ecosystem, with genus-level representatives for more than sixty per cent of the community. Meta-omic analysis revealed key populations involved in the degradation of organic matter, including bacteria whose genomes encode a previously undescribed fungal pathway for xylose degradation. Microbial and geochemical data highlight lineages that correlate with the production of greenhouse gases and indicate novel syntrophic relationships. Our findings link changing biogeochemistry to specific microbial lineages involved in carbon processing, and provide key information for predicting the effects of climate change on permafrost systems."
https://openalex.org/W2884819478,"Mutations in the gene encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) occur in several types of cancer, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In model systems, mutant IDH2 causes hematopoietic differentiation arrest. Enasidenib, a selective small-molecule inhibitor of mutant IDH2, produces a clinical response in 40% of treated patients with relapsed/refractory AML by promoting leukemic cell differentiation. Here, we studied the clonal basis of response and acquired resistance to enasidenib treatment. Using sequential patient samples, we determined the clonal structure of hematopoietic cell populations at different stages of differentiation. Before therapy, IDH2-mutant clones showed variable differentiation arrest. Enasidenib treatment promoted hematopoietic differentiation from either terminal or ancestral mutant clones; less frequently, treatment promoted differentiation of nonmutant cells. Analysis of paired diagnosis/relapse samples did not identify second-site mutations in IDH2 at relapse. Instead, relapse arose by clonal evolution or selection of terminal or ancestral clones, thus highlighting multiple bypass pathways that could potentially be targeted to restore differentiation arrest. These results show how mapping of clonal structure in cell populations at different stages of differentiation can reveal the response and evolution of clones during treatment response and relapse."
https://openalex.org/W2884857090,"The hereditary cancer syndromes hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer (HLRCC) and succinate dehydrogenase-related hereditary paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma (SDH PGL/PCC) are linked to germline loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding the Krebs cycle enzymes fumarate hydratase and succinate dehydrogenase, thus leading to elevated levels of fumarate and succinate, respectively1-3. Here, we report that fumarate and succinate both suppress the homologous recombination (HR) DNA-repair pathway required for the resolution of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and for the maintenance of genomic integrity, thus rendering tumor cells vulnerable to synthetic-lethal targeting with poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. These results identify HLRCC and SDH PGL/PCC as familial DNA-repair deficiency syndromes, providing a mechanistic basis to explain their cancer predisposition and suggesting a potentially therapeutic approach for advanced HLRCC and SDH PGL/PCC, both of which are incurable when metastatic."
https://openalex.org/W2883876697,"For inherited genetic diseases, fetal gene therapy offers the potential of prophylaxis against early, irreversible and lethal pathological change. To explore this, we studied neuronopathic Gaucher disease (nGD), caused by mutations in GBA. In adult patients, the milder form presents with hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and occasional lung and bone disease; this is managed, symptomatically, by enzyme replacement therapy. The acute childhood lethal form of nGD is untreatable since enzyme cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Patients with nGD exhibit signs consistent with hindbrain neurodegeneration, including neck hyperextension, strabismus and, often, fatal apnea1. We selected a mouse model of nGD carrying a loxP-flanked neomycin disruption of Gba plus Cre recombinase regulated by the keratinocyte-specific K14 promoter. Exclusive skin expression of Gba prevents fatal neonatal dehydration. Instead, mice develop fatal neurodegeneration within 15 days2. Using this model, fetal intracranial injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector reconstituted neuronal glucocerebrosidase expression. Mice lived for up to at least 18 weeks, were fertile and fully mobile. Neurodegeneration was abolished and neuroinflammation ameliorated. Neonatal intervention also rescued mice but less effectively. As the next step to clinical translation, we also demonstrated the feasibility of ultrasound-guided global AAV gene transfer to fetal macaque brains."
https://openalex.org/W2883611877,"Cellular heme is thought to be distributed between a pool of sequestered heme that is tightly bound within hemeproteins and a labile heme pool required for signaling and transfer into proteins. A heme chaperone that can hold and allocate labile heme within cells has long been proposed but never been identified. Here, we show that the glycolytic protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) fulfills this role by acting as an essential repository and allocator of bioavailable heme to downstream protein targets. We identified a conserved histidine in GAPDH that is needed for its robust heme binding both in vitro and in mammalian cells. Substitution of this histidine, and the consequent decreases in GAPDH heme binding, antagonized heme delivery to both cytosolic and nuclear hemeprotein targets, including inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in murine macrophages and the nuclear transcription factor Hap1 in yeast, even though this GAPDH variant caused cellular levels of labile heme to rise dramatically. We conclude that by virtue of its heme-binding property, GAPDH binds and chaperones labile heme to create a heme pool that is bioavailable to downstream proteins. Our finding solves a fundamental question in cell biology and provides a new foundation for exploring heme homeostasis in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2885012499,"Neuronal migration defects, including pachygyria, are among the most severe developmental brain defects in humans. Here, we identify biallelic truncating mutations in CTNNA2, encoding αN-catenin, in patients with a distinct recessive form of pachygyria. CTNNA2 was expressed in human cerebral cortex, and its loss in neurons led to defects in neurite stability and migration. The αN-catenin paralog, αE-catenin, acts as a switch regulating the balance between β-catenin and Arp2/3 actin filament activities1. Loss of αN-catenin did not affect β-catenin signaling, but recombinant αN-catenin interacted with purified actin and repressed ARP2/3 actin-branching activity. The actin-binding domain of αN-catenin or ARP2/3 inhibitors rescued the neuronal phenotype associated with CTNNA2 loss, suggesting ARP2/3 de-repression as a potential disease mechanism. Our findings identify CTNNA2 as the first catenin family member with biallelic mutations in humans, causing a new pachygyria syndrome linked to actin regulation, and uncover a key factor involved in ARP2/3 repression in neurons. Biallelic truncating mutations in CTNNA2, encoding αN-catenin, cause a new pachygyria syndrome associated with actin regulation and ARP2 and ARP3 repression in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2884299905,"The protein kinase C (PKC) enzymes have long been established as critical for synaptic plasticity. However, it is unknown whether Ca2+-dependent PKC isozymes are activated in dendritic spines during plasticity and, if so, how this synaptic activity is encoded by PKC. Here, using newly developed, isozyme-specific sensors, we demonstrate that classical isozymes are activated to varying degrees and with distinct kinetics. PKCα is activated robustly and rapidly in stimulated spines and is the only isozyme required for structural plasticity. This specificity depends on a PDZ-binding motif present only in PKCα. The activation of PKCα during plasticity requires both NMDA receptor Ca2+ flux and autocrine brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)–TrkB signaling, two pathways that differ vastly in their spatiotemporal scales of signaling. Our results suggest that, by integrating these signals, PKCα combines a measure of recent, nearby synaptic plasticity with local synaptic input, enabling complex cellular computations such as heterosynaptic facilitation of plasticity necessary for efficient hippocampus-dependent learning. Through the development of novel PKC biosensors, the authors describe how PKCα, but not other classical isozymes, facilitates plasticity in dendritic regions through the integration of recent synaptic plasticity with current, local synaptic input."
https://openalex.org/W2884338874,Recent studies report serine ADP-ribosylation on nucleosomes during the DNA damage response. We unveil histone H3 serine 10 as the primary acceptor residue for chromatin ADP-ribosylation and find that specific histone acetylation marks block this activity. Our results provide a molecular explanation for the well-documented phenomenon of rapid deacetylation at DNA damage sites and support the combinatorial application of PARP and HDAC inhibitors for the treatment of PARP-dependent cancers. Histone H3 serine 10 is found to be the major chromatin acceptor residue for DNA damage–induced ADP-ribosylation and is blocked by specific acetylation sites on PARP1 and/or H3.
https://openalex.org/W2950176133,"Psychiatric illness is unlikely to arise from pathology occurring uniformly across all cell types in affected brain regions. Despite this, transcriptomic analyses of the human brain have typically been conducted using macro-dissected tissue due to the difficulty of performing single-cell type analyses with donated post-mortem brains. To address this issue statistically, we compiled a database of several thousand transcripts that were specifically-enriched in one of 10 primary cortical cell types in previous publications. Using this database, we predicted the relative cell type content for 833 human cortical samples using microarray or RNA-Seq data from the Pritzker Consortium (GSE92538) or publicly-available databases (GSE53987, GSE21935, GSE21138, CommonMind Consortium). These predictions were generated by averaging normalized expression levels across transcripts specific to each cell type using our R-package BrainInABlender (validated and publicly-released on github). Using this method, we found that the principal components of variation in the datasets strongly correlated with the predicted neuronal/glial content of the samples. This variability was not simply due to dissection–the relative balance of brain cell types appeared to be influenced by a variety of demographic, pre- and post-mortem variables. Prolonged hypoxia around the time of death predicted increased astrocytic and endothelial gene expression, illustrating vascular upregulation. Aging was associated with decreased neuronal gene expression. Red blood cell gene expression was reduced in individuals who died following systemic blood loss. Subjects with Major Depressive Disorder had decreased astrocytic gene expression, mirroring previous morphometric observations. Subjects with Schizophrenia had reduced red blood cell gene expression, resembling the hypofrontality detected in fMRI experiments. Finally, in datasets containing samples with especially variable cell content, we found that controlling for predicted sample cell content while evaluating differential expression improved the detection of previously-identified psychiatric effects. We conclude that accounting for cell type can greatly improve the interpretability of transcriptomic data."
https://openalex.org/W2884679414,"The Twin Simulator of the Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (TWINSHIME®) was initially developed to study the luminal gut microbiota of the ascending (AC), transverse (TC), and descending (DC) colon regions. Given the unique composition and potential importance of the mucosal microbiota for human health, the TWINSHIME was recently adapted to simulate the mucosal microbiota as well as the luminal community. It has been previously demonstrated that the luminal community in the TWINSHIME reaches a steady state within two weeks post inoculation, and is able to differentiate into region specific communities. However, less is known regarding the mucosal community structure and dynamics. During the current study, the luminal and mucosal communities in each region of the TWINSHIME were evaluated over the course of six weeks. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and short chain fatty acid analysis, it was determined that both the luminal and mucosal communities reached stability 10-20 days after inoculation, and remained stable until the end of the experiment. Bioinformatics analysis revealed the formation of unique community structures between the mucosal and luminal phases in all three colon regions, yet these communities were similar to the inoculum. Specific colonizers of the mucus mainly belonged to the Firmicutes phylum and included Lachnospiraceae (AC/TC/DC), Ruminococcaceae and Eubacteriaceae (AC), Lactobacillaceae (AC/TC), Clostridiaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae (TC/DC). In contrast, Bacteroidaceae were enriched in the gut lumen of all three colon regions. The unique profile of short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production further demonstrated system stability, but also proved to be an area of marked differences between the in vitro system and in vivo reports. Results of this study demonstrate that it is possible to replicate the community structure and composition of the gut microbiota in vitro. Through implementation of this system, the human gut microbiota can be studied in a dynamic and continuous fashion."

They are targets of antihypertensive and antiarrhythmic drugs such as diltiazem. Here, we present a photoswitchable diltiazem, FHU-779, which can be used to reversibly block endogenous LTCCs by light. FHU-779 is as potent as diltiazem and can be used to place pancreatic β-cell function and cardiac activity under optical control. A photoswitchable probe to control Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels is useful in pancreatic β cells and can be employed to modulate beating rate in explanted hearts."
https://openalex.org/W2855832140,"Using a heterokaryon system, Mai et al. demonstrate that NKX3-1 is downstream of IL-6–STAT3, regulates endogenous OCT4 expression during human iPSC reprogramming, and can also substitute for exogenous OCT4 in the reprogramming cocktail. Reprogramming somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is now routinely accomplished by overexpression of the four Yamanaka factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, MYC (or OSKM))1. These iPSCs can be derived from patients’ somatic cells and differentiated toward diverse fates, serving as a resource for basic and translational research. However, mechanistic insights into regulators and pathways that initiate the pluripotency network remain to be resolved. In particular, naturally occurring molecules that activate endogenous OCT4 and replace exogenous OCT4 in human iPSC reprogramming have yet to be found. Using a heterokaryon reprogramming system we identified NKX3-1 as an early and transiently expressed homeobox transcription factor. Following knockdown of NKX3-1, iPSC reprogramming is abrogated. NKX3-1 functions downstream of the IL-6–STAT3 regulatory network to activate endogenous OCT4. Importantly, NKX3-1 substitutes for exogenous OCT4 to reprogram both mouse and human fibroblasts at comparable efficiencies and generate fully pluripotent stem cells. Our findings establish an essential role for NKX3-1, a prostate-specific tumour suppressor, in iPSC reprogramming."
https://openalex.org/W2884466183,"We aimed to evaluate the site of placentation on the pregnancy outcomes of patients with placenta previa.This retrospective study included 678 cases of placenta previa. Basic information and pregnancy outcome data were collected. Differences between the different placenta previa positions and pregnancy outcomes were compared using the chi-square and independent t tests. Logistic and multiple regression analyses were used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) to determine the risk factors for PAS disorders and postpartum hemorrhage and evaluate the effect of placental attachment site on pregnancy outcomes.There was no significant difference between the PAS disorders rate and the incidence of complete placenta previa depending on the type of placentation; however, placental attachment site influenced the pregnancy outcome. Placental attachment to the anterior wall was associated with shorter gestational age, low birth weight, lower Apgar score, higher prenatal bleeding rate, increased postpartum hemorrhage, longer duration of hospitalization, and higher blood transfusion and hysterectomy rates compared to cases with lateral/posterior wall placenta. Placental attachment at the incision site of a previous cesarean section significantly increased the incidence of complete placenta previa and PAS disorders compared with placental attachment at a site without incision, but did not significantly influence pregnancy outcomes. Placental attachment to the anterior wall was an independent risk factor for postpartum hemorrhage in patients with placenta previa. Placental attachment to a previous incision site was an independent risk factor for PAS disorders.The site of placental attachment in patients with placenta previa has an important influence on the pregnancy outcome. When the placenta is located on the anterior wall, clinicians should pay attention to the adverse pregnancy outcomes and the possibility of massive postpartum hemorrhage. In cases of placental attachment to the uterine incision site, physicians should be highly vigilant regarding the occurrence of PAS disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2883063010,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system treated with disease-modifying therapies, including the biologic, interferon-β (IFN-β). Up to 60% of IFN-β-exposed MS patients develop abnormal biochemical liver test results1,2, and 1 in 50 experiences drug-induced liver injury3. Since genomic variation contributes to other forms of drug-induced liver injury4,5, we aimed to identify biomarkers of IFN-β-induced liver injury using a two-stage genome-wide association study. The rs2205986 variant, previously linked to differential expression of IRF6, surpassed genome-wide significance in the combined two-stage analysis (P = 2.3 × 10–8, odds ratio = 8.3, 95% confidence interval = 3.6–19.2). Analysis of an independent cohort of IFN-β-treated MS patients identified via electronic medical records showed that rs2205986 was also associated with increased peak levels of aspartate aminotransferase (P = 7.6 × 10–5) and alkaline phosphatase (P = 4.9 × 10-4). We show that these findings may be applicable to predicting IFN-β-induced liver injury, offering insight into its safer use. A genome-wide study identifies common variation near IRF6 associated with liver injury induced by IFN-β in individuals treated for multiple sclerosis. The risk locus is associated with differential expression of IRF6 and may help guide safer use of this biologic."
https://openalex.org/W2883402907,"Heading date (HD) of cereals is an important trait for adaptation to diverse environments and is critical for determining yield and quality and the number of genes and gene combinations that confer earliness in barley under short days is limited. In our study, a QTL for early flowering was identified from the cross between an Australian malting barley cultivar and a Chinese landrace. Four sets of near isogenic lines (NILs) were developed with a QTL located on chromosome 5H at the interval of 122.0-129.0 cM. Further experiments were conducted to investigate how this gene was regulated by photoperiod using the NILs with three sowing dates from autumn to summer. The NILs carrying the earliness allele were significantly earlier than the late genotype at all sowing dates. This gene was different from previously reported vernalisation genes that are located at a similar position as no vernalisation was required for all the NILs. The difference between this gene and Eam5 (HvPHYC) locus which also located between two co-segregated markers (3398516S5, 122.5 cM, and 4014046D5, 126.1 cM), is that with the existence of Ppd-H1 (Eam1), Eam5 has no effect on ear emergence under long days while the gene from TX9425 still reduced the time to ear emergency. The locus showed no pleiotropic effects on grain pasting properties and agronomic traits except for spike length and number of spikelets per spike, and thus can be effectively used in breeding programs. The array of early heading dates caused by interactions of Eam5 gene with other maturity genes provides an opportunity to better fine tune heading dates with production environments, which can be critical factor in barley breeding."

In this study, we use EMD-HW bagging method for nonstationary and nonlinear time series forecasting. The EMD-HW bagging method is based on the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), the moving block bootstrap and the Holt-Winter. The stock market time series of six countries are used to compare EMD-HW bagging method. This comparison is based on five forecasting error measurements. The comparison shows that the forecasting results of EMD-HW bagging are more accurate than the forecasting results of the fourteen selected methods."

https://openalex.org/W2883949007,"Background Empirical evidence has shown that cardiac rehabilitation programs are effective in reducing morbidity and mortality, improving quality of life in patients with cardiovascular disease. Despite the benefits, women have a high cardiac rehabilitation dropout rate. Our aim was to explore women’s perceptions about the reasons they faced for dropout from these programs. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with women (n = 10) after dropping out from three different cardiac rehabilitation centers in Spain. In addition, a focus group and a semi-structured interview with cardiovascular professionals were conducted. From a grounded theory perspective, thematic analysis was used to derive themes from interview transcripts. Results The women were between 41 and 70 years. We identified five general themes that illustrated reasons for cardiac rehabilitation dropout: intrapersonal reasons (self-reported health, self-reported mental health, health beliefs); interpersonal reasons (family caregiver role, work conflicts); logistical reasons (transport, distance); cardiac rehabilitation program characteristics (perception of the objective of cardiac rehabilitation, exercise component, inconvenient timing, cardiac rehabilitation equipment); and health system reasons (financial assistance for transport, long waiting list). The cardiovascular professionals found barriers to cardiac rehabilitation completion similar to those found by the women. Conclusions In order to prevent cardiac rehabilitation dropout in women, modular and flexible programs are needed. In addition, the inclusion of primary care centers or community resources could improve cardiac rehabilitation completion in women. Psychological assessment and counseling during cardiac rehabilitation should be included as an essential part of the programs and recommended for those women with depressive symptoms. Finally, improved financial assistance for transport from the health system is essential."
https://openalex.org/W2884550124,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many disease-associated noncoding variants, but cannot distinguish functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (fSNPs) from others that reside incidentally within risk loci. To address this challenge, we developed an unbiased high-throughput screen that employs type IIS enzymatic restriction to identify fSNPs that allelically modulate the binding of regulatory proteins. We coupled this approach, termed SNP-seq, with flanking restriction enhanced pulldown (FREP) to identify regulation of CD40 by three disease-associated fSNPs via four regulatory proteins, RBPJ, RSRC2 and FUBP-1/TRAP150. Applying this approach across 27 loci associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis, we identified 148 candidate fSNPs, including two that regulate STAT4 via the regulatory proteins SATB2 and H1.2. Together, these findings establish the utility of tandem SNP-seq/FREP to bridge the gap between GWAS and disease mechanism."

In this study, we identified circRNAs using deep sequencing and analyzed their expression under drought stress. We identified 899 circRNAs in total, among which 33 (23 upregulated, 10 downregulated) were shown to be dehydration-responsive. We performed GO and KEGG enrichment analysis to predict the functions of differentially expressed circRNAs. 309 circRNAs were predicted to act as sponges for 180 miRNAs. A circRNA-miRNA co-expression network was constructed based on correlation analysis between the differentially expressed circRNAs and their miRNA binding sites. Our study will provide a rich genetic resource for the discovery of genes related to drought stress, and can readily be applied to other fruit trees."
https://openalex.org/W2884761740,"In a recent study of electronic health records (EHR) of general practitioners in a livestock-dense area in The Netherlands in 2009, associations were found between residential distance to poultry farms and the occurrence of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In addition, in a recent cross-sectional study in 2494 adults in 2014/2015 an association between CAP and proximity to goat farms was observed. Here, we extended the 2009 EHR analyses across a wider period of time (2009–2013), a wider set of health effects, and a wider set of farm types as potential risk sources. A spatial (transmission) kernel model was used to investigate associations between proximity to farms and CAP diagnosis for the period from 2009 to 2013, obtained from EHR of in total 140,059 GP patients. Also, associations between proximity to farms and upper respiratory infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and (as a control disease) lower back pain were analysed. Farm types included as potential risk sources in these analyses were cattle, (dairy) goats, mink, poultry, sheep, and swine. The previously found association between CAP occurrence and proximity to poultry farms was confirmed across the full 5-year study period. In addition, we found an association between increased risk for pneumonia and proximity to (dairy) goat farms, again consistently across all years from 2009 to 2013. No consistent associations were found for any of the other farm types (cattle, mink, sheep and swine), nor for the other health effects considered. On average, the proximity to poultry farms corresponds to approximately 119 extra patients with CAP each year per 100,000 people in the research area, which accounts for approximately 7.2% extra cases. The population attributable risk percentage of CAP cases in the research area attributable to proximity to goat farms is approximately 5.4% over the years 2009–2013. The most probable explanation for the association of CAP with proximity to poultry farms is thought to be that particulate matter and its components are making people more susceptible to respiratory infections. The causes of the association with proximity to goat farms is still unclear. Although the 2007–2010 Q-fever epidemic in the area probably contributed Q-fever related pneumonia cases to the observed additional cases in 2009 and 2010, it cannot explain the association found in later years 2011–2013."

https://openalex.org/W2884209909,"Endosomal transport represents the primary mode for intracellular trafficking and signaling transduction and thus has to be tightly controlled. The molecular processes controlling the endosomal positioning utilize several large protein complexes, one of which contains the small GTPase Rab7, Rab-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP), and oxysterol-binding protein–related protein 1 (ORP1L). Rab7 is known to interact with RILP through a canonical binding site termed the effector-interacting switch region, but it is not clear how Rab7 interacts with ORP1L, limiting our understanding of the overall process. Here, we report structural and biochemical investigation of the Rab7-ORP1L interaction. We found that, contrary to prior studies, the interaction between Rab7 and the N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (ARDN) of ORP1L is independent of Rab7's GTP- or GDP-binding state. Moreover, we show that Rab7 interacts with ORP1L ARDN via a unique region consisting of helix3 (α3) and 310-helix 2 (η2). This architecture leaves the canonical effector-interacting switch regions available for RILP binding and thus allows formation of the ORP1L-Rab7-RILP tripartite complex. Mutational disruption of the interacting interface between ORP1L and Rab7 compromised the ability of ORP1L-Rab7-RILP to regulate the late endosome positioning.

Like various other Rabs, Rab7 cycles between a GTP-bound active state (GTP-Rab7) and a GDP-bound inactive state (GDP-Rab7). This cycle is controlled by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor complex and a GTPase-activating protein. GTP-Rab7 localizes to late endosomes where it interacts with distinct Rab7 effectors to control the late endosome–related events. For example, GTP-Rab7 interacts with Rab-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP), which forms a complex with dynein-dynactin motor and thus drives movement of late endosomes toward microtubule minus ends (2Cantalupo G.

Alternatively, GTP-Rab7 interacts with FYVE and coiled-coil domain–containing protein 1 to drive transport of late endosomes toward microtubule plus ends (4Pankiv S. Alemu E.A. Brech A. Bruun J.A.

Recent reports revealed that late endosomal positioning is regulated by the cholesterol levels in the late endosomes. The cholesterol level in the late endosomes is sensed by oxysterol-binding protein–related protein 1 (ORP1L) (9Rocha N. Kuijl C. van der Kant R. Janssen L. Houben D. Janssen H. Zwart W. Neefjes J. Cholesterol sensor ORP1L contacts the ER protein VAP to control Rab7-RILP-p150 Glued and late endosome positioning.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185 (19564404): 1209-122510.1083/jcb.200811005Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). ORP1L contains an N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain (ARD), a pleckstrin homology domain (PHD), a FFAT motif (two phenylalanines (FF) in an acidic tract), and a C-terminal oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP)-related domain (ORD). When cholesterol molecules in the late endosomes are present at high levels, ORP1L binds to cholesterol through the ORD and adopts a conformation that enables the interaction of ARD in ORP1L with the Rab7-RILP complex. The latter further recruits the dynein-dynactin complex, resulting in a clustering of late endosomes at the microtubule-organizing center. When cholesterol molecules are present at low levels, ORP1L fails to bind cholesterol, thus allowing exposure of the FFAT motif, which interacts with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–resident vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein (VAP). As a consequence, the dynein-dynactin complex dissociates from Rab7-RILP, facilitating the formation of ER-LE membrane contact sites and distribution of LEs at the cell periphery (9Rocha N. Kuijl C. van der Kant R. Janssen L. Houben D. Janssen H. Zwart W. Neefjes J. Cholesterol sensor ORP1L contacts the ER protein VAP to control Rab7-RILP-p150 Glued and late endosome positioning.J.

The interaction between Rab7 and RILP has previously been studied using X-ray crystallography. Analysis of the Rab7-RILP structure at high resolution showed that GTP-bound Rab7 interacts with RILP using its “effector-interacting switch region” and Rab subfamily motifs 1 and 4 (10Wu M. Wang T. Loh E. Hong W. Song H. Structural basis for recruitment of RILP by small GTPase Rab7.EMBO J. 2005; 24 (15933719): 1491-150110.1038/sj.emboj.7600643Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These effector-interacting switch regions represent canonical binding sites recognized by most Rab effectors (11Khan A.R. Ménétrey J.

However, little structural detail is established as to how ORP1L and RILP simultaneously interact with Rab7 during cholesterol-dependent positioning of late endosomes. Here, we set out to identify the molecular details of this mechanism by performing both structural and biochemical analyses of ORP1L-Rab7-RILP complex. Our structural data clearly show that ORP1L ARDN binds to a noncanonical region of Rab7, which is positioned away from the effector-interacting switch region, thus enabling Rab7 to bind both ORP1L and RILP in a simultaneous manner. GTP is crucial for the interactions between Rab7 and its downstream effectors. ORP1L was reported to preferentially bind to GTP-Rab7 in mammalian two-hybrid assays (8Johansson M. Lehto M. Tanhuanpää K. Cover T.L. Olkkonen V.M. The oxysterol-binding protein homologue ORP1L interacts with Rab7 and alters functional properties of late endocytic compartments.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16 (16176980): 5480-549210.1091/mbc.e05-03-0189Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To test whether GTP is required for the interaction between hORP1L and Rab7, we used dominant active mutant and dominant negative mutant of Rab7 and performed coimmunoprecipitation assays. According to previous reports, the dominant active mutant, Q67L, specifically binds to GTP and exhibits a much slower rate of GTP hydrolysis compared with the WT form. In contrast, the dominant negative mutant, T22N, exhibits higher binding affinity for GDP than GTP (2Cantalupo G. Alifano P. Roberti V. Bruni C.B. Bucci C. Rab-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP): the Rab7 effector required for transport to lysosomes.EMBO J. 2001; 20 (11179213): 683-69310.1093/emboj/20.4.683Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 14Clark B.S.

For example, the interaction between T22N and WD repeat domain 91 (WDR91) or Rubicon was barely detectable (5Sun Q. Westphal W. Wong K.N. Tan I. Zhong Q. Rubicon controls endosome maturation as a Rab7 effector.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107 (20974968): 19338-1934310.1073/pnas.1010554107Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 16Liu K.

However, we found that full-length hORP1L coprecipitated with both Q67L and T22N in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 1A), although the amount of the hORP1L protein precipitated by Q67L was higher than that precipitated by T22N. We next defined the core regions in hORP1L necessary for its interaction with Rab7. It was reported that the ARD of hORP1L is required for Rab7 interaction (8Johansson M. Lehto M. Tanhuanpää K. Cover T.L. Olkkonen V.M. The oxysterol-binding protein homologue ORP1L interacts with Rab7 and alters functional properties of late endocytic compartments.Mol. Biol.

Minneci F. Nugent T.C. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Scalable web services for the PSIPRED Protein Analysis Workbench.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41 (23748958): W349-W35710.1093/nar/gkt381Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar), and Phyre2, a secondary structure prediction website (18Kelley L.A. Mezulis S. Yates C.M. Wass M.N. Sternberg M.J. The Phyre2 web portal for protein modeling, prediction and analysis.Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10 (25950237): 845-85810.1038/nprot.2015.053Crossref PubMed Scopus (6086) Google Scholar), ARD is further separated into two subdomains from Gln-137, which is located on a loop between two helices. Consistent with these results, we found that a 15–18-kDa fragment at the N-terminal ARD was stable in a proteinase digestion assay (Fig. S1). Thus, we separated ARD into two regions, ARDN (ORP1L(1–136)) and ARDC (ORP1L(141–237)), and tested their interactions with Rab7. Our pulldown assay results clearly showed that ARDN, but not ARDC, is required for the interaction between hORP1L and Rab7 (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1C, the in vitro interaction between recombinant ARDN and Rab7 is independent of the GTP- or GDP-binding states of Rab7. To determine the binding affinity between ARDN and Rab7, we performed an isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assay. As shown in Fig. 1D, the dissociation constants of ARDN binding to Rab7-WT-GTP, Rab7-Q67L-GTP, and Rab7-T22N-GDP were calculated as 3.2 ± 0.3, 3.5 ± 0.6, and 2.5 ± 0.3 μm, respectively. These in vitro results showed that hORP1L binds to Rab7 using ARDN and that their interaction is independent of the nucleotide-binding states of Rab7. To determine the structure of ARDN and Rab7 at high resolution, we expressed and purified the ARDN of mORP1L and N-terminal residues 1–176 of dominant active mutant Rab7-Q67L, which binds to ORP1L. The identity of mORP1L and hORP1L in the ARDN region is 86.76%, suggesting that the structures of hORP1L and mORP1L are identical. The elution volumes of the single proteins and their complex in a Superdex 75 gel filtration column suggest that the monomeric ARDN and Rab7 form heterodimers in solution (Fig. 2A). Both ARDN and the ARDN-Rab7 complex were crystallized. The crystal structure of ARDN was determined at 2.14 Å using the molecular replacement method (Fig. 2B). Comparable with canonical ankyrin repeat domain structures, the structure of ARDN is composed of four tandem ankyrin repeats (ANK 1–4). Each ANK repeat contains a pair of antiparallel α-helices. The ANK repeats pack side by side and constitute a concave structure with the first helixes of the ANK repeats (H1, H3, H5, and H7) in the inner side. The loops between ANK repeats fold into β-hairpin structures, known as Fingers 1–3 in this structure (19Mosavi L.K. Cammett T.J. Desrosiers D.C. Peng Z.Y. The ankyrin repeat as molecular architecture for protein recognition.Protein Sci. 2004; 13 (15152081): 1435-144810.1110/ps.03554604Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The fingers stretch out perpendicularly to the inner side of the concave structure. In addition, we determined the structure of the ARDN-Rab7 complex at 2.14 Å (Fig. 2C). Different from the reported ARD of the VPS9 domain ankyrin repeat protein, which uses its convex side to bind the switch regions of Rab32 (20Hesketh G.G. Pérez-Dorado I. Jackson L.P. Wartosch L. Schäfer I.B. Gray S.R. McCoy A.J. Zeldin O.B. Garman E.F. Harbour M.E. Evans P.R. Seaman M.N.J. Luzio J.P. Owen D.J.

The ARDN-binding site in Rab7 consists of α3, η2, and the loop between them, which is located away from the conventional effector-binding switch regions (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. S2, we found a conformation change of Finger 1 in ARDN through comparison of the structures of ARDN alone and ARDN-Rab7. The buried interface area between ARDN and Rab7 is approximately 680 Å2 as calculated by PISA (Proteins, Interfaces, Structures and Assemblies) (21Krissinel E. Henrick K. Inference of macromolecular assemblies from crystalline state.J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372 (17681537): 774-79710.1016/j.jmb.2007.05.022Crossref PubMed Scopus (6769) Google Scholar). As the ARDN-binding site in Rab7 is located away from its nucleotide-binding pocket (Fig. 2C), this structure is consistent with our hypothesis that ARDN-Rab7 interaction is nucleotide-independent. To verify the interaction between ARDN-Rab7 and RILP, we performed pulldown assays using purified GSH S-transferase (GST)-tagged ARDN (GST-ORP1L ARDN), His-tagged RILP(241–320), and His-tagged Rab7. As shown in Fig. 2D, in the presence of GTP-bound Rab7, RILP binds to ARDN. To build a model for the ORP1L-Rab7-RILP ternary complex, we superposed the structures of ARDN-Rab7 with Rab7-RILP (Protein Data Bank (PDB) code 1YHN) (10Wu M. Wang T. Loh E. Hong W. Song H. Structural basis for recruitment of RILP by small GTPase Rab7.EMBO J. 2005; 24 (15933719): 1491-150110.1038/sj.emboj.7600643Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) based on the structure of Rab7 (Fig. 2E). In this model, two ARDN-Rab7 heterodimers were bridged by an RILP homodimer, forming an X-shaped structure with C2 symmetry. Because ARDN and RILP interact with Rab7 at different positions, this model provides structural explanations for the fact that ORP1L and RILP simultaneously interact with Rab7 (3Johansson M. Rocha N. Zwart W. Jordens I. Janssen L. Kuijl C. Olkkonen V.M. Neefjes J. Activation of endosomal dynein motors by stepwise assembly of Rab7-RILP-p150Glued, ORP1L, and the receptor βIII spectrin.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176 (17283181): 459-47110.1083/jcb.200606077Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). To study the amino acids required for ARDN-Rab7 heterodimer formation, we analyzed the structure of ARDN-Rab7 complex, mutated the crucial amino acids in the protein-protein interface, and performed GST pulldown assays. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, Trp-49 (Finger 1), Tyr-57 (H3), Phe-58 (H3), and Phe-90 (H5) in ARDN constitute a hydrophobic region in the inner face of the concave structure. The aromatic groups in these residues interact with the side chains of Ile-108 and Pro-115 in Rab7. In addition, the positive-charged side chains of Arg-14, Lys-44, and Arg-93 in ARDN interact with the negative-charged side chains of Asp-104, Glu-105, and Glu-116 in Rab7, respectively (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3A, hydrogen bonds formed between Phe-90, Arg-87, and Tyr-57 in ARDN and Arg-113, Ser-111, and Pro-112 in Rab7. In addition, we performed sequence alignments for Rab7 and other Rab GTPases family members. As shown in Fig. 3C, the ARD-binding sites in Rab7 are not conserved in the Rab family, suggesting that ORP1L specifically binds Rab7 but not any other Rab proteins. This result is consistent with a previous study (22Kanno E. Ishibashi K. Kobayashi H. Matsui T. Ohbayashi N. Fukuda M. Comprehensive screening for novel rab-binding proteins by GST pull-down assay using 60 different mammalian Rabs.Traffic. 2010; 11 (20070612): 491-50710.1111/j.1600-0854.2010.01038.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Compared with the WT ARDN, the binding abilities of ARDN mutants W49A, Y57A/F58A, and F90A with Rab7 were greatly reduced (Fig. 3D). In agreement with this result, mutations at Ile-108 and Pro-115 in Rab7 greatly reduced the interaction between Rab7 and ARDN (Fig. 3F). In addition, the interaction between Rab7 and ARDN was also abolished by mutants affecting the electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bond formation, including R14A, R87A, and R93A in ARDN and D104A, E105A, E116A, S111A, and R113A in Rab7 (Fig. 3, E–G). In contrast, the mutants L98D, E65K/D66K, and Y103A, whose mutation sites are far from the ARDN-Rab7 interface, preserved their binding abilities (Fig. S3A). Although failing to bind ARDN, Rab7 mutants D104A and S111A still interacted with RILP (Fig. S3B), indicating that the structural integrity of Rab7 is not destabilized by these mutations. To examine the interaction between ORP1L and Rab7 in vivo, we performed coimmunoprecipitation assays. As shown in Fig. 4A, full-length ORP1L-Y57A/F58A mutant failed to coprecipitate with Rab7, and Rab7-S111A mutant did not associate with ORP1L (see also Fig. 1A). In agreement with this result, ORP1L-Y57A/F58A mutant failed to colocalize with Rab7 and was distributed evenly in the cytosol (Fig. 4, B and C). In contrast, the WT ORP1L proteins are recruited to late endosomes, indicated by CD63, an independent endosome marker (23Kobayashi T. Vischer U.M. Rosnoblet C. Lebrand C. Lindsay M. Parton R.G. Kruithof E.K. Gruenberg J. The tetraspanin CD63/lamp3 cycles between endocytic and secretory compartments in human endothelial cells.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11 (10793155): 1829-184310.1091/mbc.11.5.1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Moreover, siRNA knockdown of Rab7 abolished the endosomal localization of ORP1L, which was rescued by expression of an siRNA-resistant Rab7. However, expression of siRNA-resistant Rab7-S111A failed to recruit ORP1L to late endosomes (Fig. 4, D and E). Taken together, these results confirmed that ORP1L binds to the α3-η2 region but not the switch regions of Rab7. Endosomal ORP1L facilitates the formation of ER-endosome contact sites by sensing cholesterol embedded in late endosomal membranes, which is essential for properly directing and docking of late endosomes to the ER (9Rocha N. Kuijl C. van der Kant R. Janssen L. Houben D. Janssen H. Zwart W. Neefjes J. Cholesterol sensor ORP1L contacts the ER protein VAP to control Rab7-RILP-p150 Glued and late endosome positioning.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185 (19564404): 1209-122510.1083/jcb.200811005Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). To determine how important ORP1L-Rab7 interaction is for endosomal transport to the ER, we designed ORP1L(1–514) and Rab7 interaction–defective mutants of ORP1L. Because the C-terminal ORD of oxysterol-binding protein–related protein down-regulates its membrane-tethering ability (24Mesmin B. Bigay J. Moser von Filseck J. Lacas-Gervais S. Drin G. Antonny B. A four-step cycle driven by PI(4)P hydrolysis directs sterol/PI(4)P exchange by the ER-Golgi tether OSBP.Cell. 2013; 155 (24209621): 830-84310.1016/j.cell.2013.09.056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), we proposed that ORP1L(1–514), a truncated form of ORP1L without the ORD (residues 548–940), should displays a heightened ability to bind to Rab7 and VAP-A when compared with its full-length version. As shown in Fig. 5A, overexpression of ORP1L(1–514) rather than the full-length protein significantly stimulated the formation of LE-ER contact sites in HeLa cell as indicated by a strong increase in colocalization of Rab7 with VAP-A (Fig. 5A). However, expression of ORP1L(1–514) with Y57A/F58A mutation failed to induce LE-ER contacts, suggesting that the interaction with Rab7 is essential for ORP1L to promote LE-ER contact site formation (Fig. 5A). As shown in Fig. 5B, overexpression of RILP resulted in clustering of LEs around the perinuclear region in all HeLa cells because RILP drives microtubule minus-end transport of LEs. Coexpression of full-length ORP1L enhanced RILP-induced perinuclear clustering of LEs. However, coexpression of ORP1L(1–514) abolished RILP-induced perinuclear clustering of LEs. In comparison, coexpression of another ORP1L(1–514) mutant containing Y57A/F58A failed to abolish such clustering (Fig. 5B). This finding suggests that an ORP1L(1–514)-induced increase in LE-ER contacts antagonizes RILP-mediated microtubule minus-end transport of LEs and that the interaction of ORP1L with Rab7 is critical for the positioning of LEs. In this study, we found that ARDN (ORP1L(1–136)) is sufficient for ORP1L to interact with Rab7. Further crystal structure analysis of ARDN-Rab7 complex revealed that the α3-η2 region on Rab7 is required for ORP1L binding. This unique Rab effector-binding mode explained our finding that ORP1L ARDN-Rab7 binding is GTP-independent and how ORP1L-Rab7-RILP ternary complex is formed. The structure was further verified by mutagenesis, in vitro pulldowns, and colocalization analysis in cells. ORP1L was first discovered as a Rab7 effector that preferentially binds to GTP-bound Rab7 in mammalian two-hybrid assays (8Johansson M. Lehto M. Tanhuanpää K. Cover T.L. Olkkonen V.M. The oxysterol-binding protein homologue ORP1L interacts with Rab7 and alters functional properties of late endocytic compartments.Mol. Biol.

In agreement, our coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that the full-length ORP1L interacts with GTP-Rab7 more strongly than GDP-Rab7. In contrast, ORP1L ARDN binds equally well to both GTP- and GDP-bound Rab7in vitro, and the Rab7-S111A mutant failed to interact with either ARDN or the full-length ORP1L, suggesting that Rab7 binds to ARDN independently of Rab7 nucleotide-loaded states. We reason that the discrepancy in binding preference of Rab7 with ARDN and full-length ORP1L might result from the regulatory effects of the C-terminal domains within ORP1L.The regulatory effects of Rab7 effectors has been previously reported. For example, C-terminal residues 392–747 of WDR91, another Rab7 effector, interact with both GTP- and GDP-Rab7 equally; nevertheless, the full-length WDR91 preferentially binds to GTP-Rab7 (16Liu K.

In addition, it is possible that a third protein or some unknown indirect interactions are involved in the in vivo situation. For instance, it was shown that addition of RILP stabilized and increased ORP1L binding to immobilized GST-Rab7 (3Johansson M. Rocha N. Zwart W. Jordens I. Janssen L. Kuijl C. Olkkonen V.M.

Previous studies suggested that Rab GTPases use the switch regions to interact with more than one effector. For example, in the tripartite complex Rab11-phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase (PI4KIIIβ)-FIP3, PI4KIIIβ makes contacts with Rab11 on its switch I region, leaving most of the switch regions available for FIP3 to join the complex (25Burke J.E.

Most of the effort to prevent this coming catastrophe is occurring in high income countries and we do not know the extent of the problem in low and middle-income countries, largely because of low laboratory capacity coupled with lack of effective surveillance systems. We aimed at establishing the magnitude of antimicrobial resistance among Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae carried in the gut of out-patients from pastoralist communities of rural Western Uganda.A cross-sectional study was carried out among pastoralists living in and around the Queen Elizabeth Protected Area (QEPA). Stool samples were collected from individuals from pastoralist communities who presented to the health facilities with fever and/or diarrhea without malaria and delivered to the microbiology laboratory of College of Health Sciences-Makerere University for processing, culture and drug susceptibility testing.A total of 300 participants fulfilling the inclusion criteria were recruited into the study. Three hundred stool samples were collected, with 209 yielding organisms of interest. Out of 209 stool samples that were positive, 181 (89%) grew E. coli, 23 (11%) grew K. pneumoniae and five grew Shigella. Generally, high antibiotic resistance patterns were detected among E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolated. High resistance against cotrimoxazole 74%, ampicillin 67%, amoxicillin/clavulanate 37%, and ciprofloxacin 31% was observed among the E. coli. In K. pneumoniae, cotrimoxazole 68% and amoxicillin/clavulanate 46%, were the most resisted antimicrobials. Additionally, 57% and 82% of the E. coli and K. pneumoniae respectively were resistant to at least three classes of the antimicrobials tested. Resistance to carbapenems was not detected among K. pneumoniae and only 0.6% of the E. coli were resistant to carbapenems. Isolates producing ESBLs comprised 12% and 23% of E. coli and K. pneumoniae respectively.We demonstrated high antimicrobial resistance, including multidrug resistance, among E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates from pastoralist out-patients. We recommend a One Health approach to establish the sources and drivers of this problem to inform public health."

https://openalex.org/W2883617859,"The meadow spittlebug Philaenus spumarius plays a key role in the transmission of the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa to olive in Apulia (South Italy). Currently, available data on P. spumarius feeding behavior is limited, and a real-time observation of the different steps involved in stylet insertion, exploratory probes, and ingestion, has never been carried out. Therefore, we performed an EPG-assisted characterization of P. spumarius female feeding behavior on olive, in order to detect and analyze the main EPG waveforms describing their amplitude, frequency, voltage level, and electrical origin of the traces during stylet penetration in plant tissues. Thereafter, each of the main waveforms was correlated with specific biological activities, through video recording and analysis of excretion by adults and excretion/secretion by nymphs. Furthermore, the specific stylet tips position within the plant tissues during each of the waveforms observed was assessed by microcomputer tomography (micro-CT). Additional EPG-recordings were carried out with males of P. spumarius on olive, in order to assess possible sex-related differences. P. spumarius feeding behavior can be described by five main distinct waveforms: C (pathway), Xc (xylem contact/pre-ingestion), Xi (xylem sap ingestion), R (resting), N (interruption within xylem phase). Compared to males, females require shorter time to begin the first probe, and their Xi phase is significantly longer. Furthermore, considering the single waveform events, males on olive exhibit longer np and R compared to females."

The objective of this study was to develop multivariable NTCP models for these side effects. Material and methods This prospective cohort study was composed of 243 patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer (stage T1-3). Genito-urinary (GU) toxicity was assessed using a standardized follow-up program. The GU toxicity endpoints were scored using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (CTCAE 3.0) scoring system. The full bladder and different anatomical subregions within the bladder were delineated. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression analysis was used to analyze dose volume effects on the four individual endpoints. Results In the univariable analysis, urinary incontinence was significantly associated with dose distributions in the trigone (V55-V75, mean). Hematuria was significantly associated with the bladder wall dose (V40-V75, mean), bladder dose (V70-V75), cardiovascular disease and anticoagulants use. Pain during urinating was associated with the dose to the trigone (V50-V75, mean) and with trans transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). In the final multivariable model urinary incontinence was associated with the mean dose of the trigone. Hematuria was associated with bladder wall dose (V75) and cardiovascular disease, while pain during urinating was associated with trigone dose (V75) and TURP. No significant associations were found for increase in voiding frequency. Conclusions Radiation-induced urinary side effects are associated with dose distributions to different organs as risk. Given the dose effect relationships found, decreasing the dose to the trigone and bladder wall may reduce the incidence of incontinence, pain during voiding and hematuria, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2885013937,"Rat eradication has become a common conservation intervention in island ecosystems and its effectiveness in protecting native vertebrates is increasingly well documented. Yet, the impacts of rat eradication on plant communities remain poorly understood. Here we compare native and non-native tree and palm seedling abundance before and after eradication of invasive rats (Rattus rattus) from Palmyra Atoll, Line Islands, Central Pacific Ocean. Overall, seedling recruitment increased for five of the six native trees species examined. While pre-eradication monitoring found no seedlings of Pisonia grandis, a dominant tree species that is important throughout the Pacific region, post-eradication monitoring documented a notable recruitment event immediately following eradication, with up to 688 individual P. grandis seedlings per 100m2 recorded one month post-eradication. Two other locally rare native trees with no observed recruitment in pre-eradication surveys had recruitment post-rat eradication. However, we also found, by five years post-eradication, a 13-fold increase in recruitment of the naturalized and range-expanding coconut palm Cocos nucifera. Our results emphasize the strong effects that a rat eradication can have on tree recruitment with expected long-term effects on canopy composition. Rat eradication released non-native C. nucifera, likely with long-term implications for community composition, potentially necessitating future management interventions. Eradication, nevertheless, greatly benefitted recruitment of native tree species. If this pattern persists over time, we expect long-term benefits for flora and fauna dependent on these native species."
https://openalex.org/W2884010156,"Seedlessness is one of the important traits in citrus breeding. Male sterility derived from Satsuma mandarin (Citrus unshiu) has been used in Japanese citrus breeding programs to obtain seedless cultivars. The efficiency of seedless cultivar breeding would be improved by developing a selection marker linked to seedlessness. In this study, we performed QTL mapping in ‘Okitsu No. 46’ × ‘Okitsu No. 56’ (O46-O56) crosses for the number of pollen grains per anther (NPG) and apparent pollen fertility (APF), two traits used as an index of male sterility, and detected a candidate QTL for NPG (MS-P1) on linkage group 8 with a significant LOD score (7.31) and 47% of variance explained. The QTL for APF (MS-F1) was detected on linkage group 6 with a significant LOD score (5.71) and 63.6% of variance explained. The role of both MS-P1 in reducing NPG and MS-F1 in decreasing APF were confirmed with the ‘Okitsu No.46’ × ‘Kara’ (O46-K) cross. Pedigree analysis inferred that both MS-P1 and MS-F1 in ‘Okitsu No. 46’ were derived from kunenbo (Citrus nobilis) through hassaku (C. hassaku) and ‘Sweet Spring’. Cytoplasm analysis revealed that both male-sterile ‘Sweet Spring’ and ‘Okitsu No. 46’ have cytoplasm derived from Kishu (C. kinokuni hort. ex Tanaka), but the cytoplasm of male-sterile kunenbo and hassaku were derived from other varieties rather than Kishu. These results suggest that MS-P1 and MS-F1 primarily reduce the NPG and decrease APF, but their expression requires a cytoplasm derived from Kishu. These findings will improve our understanding of the molecular mechanism of male sterility in citrus and help to develop a DNA marker for seedless breeding in citrus."

Together with hyperglycemia, hIAPP-derived oligomers and aggregates are important culprits in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Here, we explored the role of the cell's main proteolytic complex, the proteasome, in hIAPP turnover in normal and stressed β-cells evoked by chronic hyperglycemia. Moderate inhibition (10–35%) of proteasome activity/function in cultured human islets by the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin enhanced intracellular accumulation of hIAPP. Unexpectedly, prolonged (>1 h) and marked (>50%) impairment of proteasome activity/function had a strong inhibitory effect on hIAPP transcription and secretion from normal and stressed β-cells. This negative compensatory feedback mechanism for controlling IAPP turnover was also observed in the lactacystin-treated rat insulinoma β-cell line (INS 832/13), demonstrating the presence of an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for IAPP production. In line with these in situ studies, our current ex vivo data showed that proteasome activity and hIAPP expression are also down-regulated in islets isolated from T2DM subjects. Gene expression and promoter activity studies demonstrated that the functional proteasome complex is required for efficient activation of the hIAPP promoter and for full expression of IAPP's essential transcription factor, FOXA2. ChIP studies revealed that promoter occupancy of FoxA2 at the rat IAPP promoter region is an important and limiting factor for amylin expression in proteasome-impaired murine cells.

https://openalex.org/W2884231027,"Hypoxia is one of the most important stressors affecting the health conditions of coastal ecosystems. In highly productive ecosystems such as the Humboldt Current ecosystem, the oxygen minimum zone is an important abiotic factor modulating the structure of benthic communities over the continental shelf. Herein, we study soft-bottom macrobenthic communities along a depth gradient-at 10, 20, 30 and 50 m-for two years to understand how hypoxia affects the structure of shallow communities at two sites in Mejillones Bay (23°S) in northern Chile. We test the hypothesis that, during months with shallow hypoxic zones, community structure will be much more dissimilar, thereby depicting a clear structural gradient with depth and correlated abiotic variables (e.g. organic matter, temperature and salinity). Likewise, during conditions of deeper hypoxic zones, communities will be similar among habitats as they could develop structure via succession in conditions with less stress. Throughout the sampling period (October 2015 to October 2017), the water column was hypoxic (from 2 to 0.5ml/l O2) most of the time, reaching shallow depths of 20 to 10 m. Only one episode of oxygenation was detected in June 2016, where normoxia (>2ml/l O2) reached down to 50 m. The structure of the communities depicted a clear pattern of increasing dissimilarity from shallow normoxic and deep hypoxic habitat. This pattern was persistent throughout time despite the occurrence of an oxygenation episode. Contrasting species abundance and biomass distribution explained the gradient in structure, arguably reflecting variable levels of hypoxia adaptation, i.e. few polychaetes such as Magelona physilia and Paraprionospio pinnata were only located in low oxygen habitats. The multivariable dispersion of community composition as a proxy of beta diversity decreased significantly with depth, suggesting loss of community structure and variability when transitioning from normoxic to hypoxic conditions. Our results show the presence of semi-permanent shallow hypoxia at Mejillones Bay, constraining diverse and more variable communities at a very shallow depth (10-20 m). These results must be considered in the context of the current decline of dissolved oxygen in most oceans and coastal regions and their impact on seabed biota."
https://openalex.org/W2883221393,"Background Previous outcome studies for extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) have included clinically diagnosed greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS). The purpose of this study is to investigate outcome of ESWT on GTPS with gluteal tendinopathy documented by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods Medical records of 38 consecutive patients were retrospectively reviewed, who underwent ESWT for GTPS with MRI-documented gluteal tendinopathy (> 6 months). ESWT was conducted (1/week) when the Roles-Maudsley score (RMS) showed “Poor” or “Fair” grade after conservative treatment until RMS had reached “Good” or “Excellent” grade (treatment success) or until 12 treatments had been applied. Numeric rating scale (NRS) and RMS were evaluated before, 1 week after (immediate follow-up) and mean 27 months after ESWT program (long-term follow-up). Success rate was calculated at each follow-up point. Results Initial NRS (5.9 ± 1.6) significantly decreased at immediate (2.5 ± 1.5, p< 0.01) and long-term follow-up (3.3 ± 3.0, p< 0.01), respectively. Success rates were 83.3% (immediate) and 55.6% (long-term), respectively. There was no correlation among age, symptom duration and NRS. Conclusion Low-energy ESWT can be an effective treatment for pain relief in chronic GTPS with MRI-documented gluteal tendinopathy. However, its long-term effect appears to decrease with time."

Reduction in oxidative stress attenuates protein carbonylation and insulin resistance, suggesting that lipid modification of proteins may play a role in metabolic disease, but the mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Herein, we show that in vivo, diet-induced obesity in mice surprisingly results in preferential carbonylation of nuclear proteins by 4-hydroxy-trans-2,3-nonenal (4-HNE) or 4-hydroxy-trans-2,3-hexenal (4-HHE). Proteomic and structural analyses revealed that residues in or around the sites of zinc coordination of zinc finger proteins, such as those containing the C2H2 or MATRIN, RING, C3H1, or N4-type DNA-binding domains, are particularly susceptible to carbonylation by lipid aldehydes. These observations strongly suggest that carbonylation functionally disrupts protein secondary structure supported by metal coordination. Analysis of one such target, the nuclear protein estrogen-related receptor γ (ERR-γ), showed that ERR-γ is modified by 4-HHE in the obese state. In vitro carbonylation decreased the DNA-binding capacity of ERR-γ and correlated with the obesity-linked down-regulation of many key genes promoting mitochondrial bioenergetics.

Consistent with glutathionylation of reactive aldehydes being linked to insulin action but not obesity per se, human GSTA4 is down-regulated in the obese and insulin-resistant but not the obese and insulin-sensitive state (8Curtis J.M. Grimsrud P.A. Wright W.S. Xu X. Foncea R.E. Graham D.W. Brestoff J.R. Wiczer B.M. Ilkayeva O. Cianflone K. Muoio D.E. Arriaga E.A. Bernlohr D.A.

Moreover, in worm models of GSH-S-transferase deficiency (Caenorhabditis elegans gst10), life span was attenuated, and following rescue with murine Gsta4, life span was potentiated (14Ayyadevara S.

Together, these observations strengthen the hypothesis that oxidative stress and subsequent protein carbonylation play a causal role in metabolic disease. Technical advances over the last decade have facilitated many proteomic studies aimed at identifying carbonylated proteins in a variety of disease models (13Curtis J.M. Hahn W.S. Stone M.D. Inda J.J.

Here, we expand upon these studies by performing site-specific analysis of in vivo protein carbonylation. We present the novel finding that secondary protein carbonylation endogenously accumulates in the nucleus of adipose tissue and modifies critical metabolic transcriptional regulators in the obese state. Furthermore, we have generated a method by which to identify these proteins and obtain site-specific and lipid-specific information. Importantly, this not only allows for more facile study of carbonylated targets but also allows for a broader analysis of carbonylation patterns and motifs. To assess secondary protein carbonylation in adipose tissue, we compared 4-HNE adducts formed in epididymal (eWAT) and inguinal (iWAT) depots of C57Bl/6J mice using an antibody directed toward 4-HNE Michael adducts. Michael adducts represent >90% of all carbonylation events (17Bruenner B.A. Jones A.D. German J.B.

Interestingly, whereas previous studies have delimited clear differences in ROS accumulation in the mitochondria from lean and obese animals as well as differences in the carbonylation status of individual proteins, whole mitochondrial extracts of eWAT from lean and obese animals did not exhibit a significant global difference (Fig. S1A), and as such, we evaluated 4-HNE–protein adducts formed in other subcellular localizations. Unexpectedly, we identified a striking accumulation of 4-HNE–modified proteins in nuclear extracts of HFD-fed mice compared with chow-fed animals (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, increased nuclear protein carbonylation was specific to the eWAT depot, as levels of carbonylated proteins in samples from iWAT between chow and HFD-fed animals were largely unchanged (Fig. 1C). To evaluate the biology of carbonylated proteins in the nucleus, we utilized the cultured 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell system. Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells exhibit reduced GSH levels and robust protein carbonylation under conditions of oxidative stress (19Vigilanza P. Aquilano K. Baldelli S. Rotilio G. Ciriolo M.R.

To reduce cellular GSH levels and achieve a pro-oxidative environment in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, cells were treated with erastin. Erastin is an inhibitor of the cystine/glutamate antiporter (system Xc−) (21Dixon S.J. Lemberg K.M. Lamprecht M.R. Skouta R. Zaitsev E.M. Gleason C.E. Patel D.N. Bauer A.J. Cantley A.M. Yang W.S.

GSH is critical for maintenance of redox homeostasis, and its depletion represents a global cellular oxidative stress phenotype. In particular, a major mechanism by which reactive lipid aldehydes, such as 4-HNE and 4-HHE, are detoxified is through glutathionylation by GSH-S-transferase A4 (8Curtis J.M. Grimsrud P.A.

As such, erastin treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes phenocopies GSH depletion in vivo. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of erastin-treated cells showed a clear co-localization of 4-HNE–modified proteins with the DAPI-labeled region, suggesting that carbonylated proteins accumulate in the nucleus of 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1E). Interestingly, the 4-HNE adducts appeared as distinct puncta but did not overlap with the DAPI staining, suggesting that there may be specific intranuclear sites that are preferentially modified. Several published studies of protein carbonylation have utilized MS-based methods and have led to the identification of numerous targets of protein carbonylation (13Curtis J.M. Hahn W.S.

However, the majority of these studies lacked the ability to identify the sites of modification in a high-throughput manner. Furthermore, the hydrazide– or 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine–based derivatization method most commonly utilized is not specific for lipophilic carbonyl adducts and will recognize any free carbonyl, thereby making it difficult to determine whether a protein is subject to primary or secondary carbonylation. To address these issues, we utilized a label-free method by which to identify site-specific Michael adducts on nuclear proteins (Fig. 2A). This method relies on immune affinity purification with an antibody directed against 4-HNE Michael adducts. Importantly, this antibody is specific for the 9-carbon 4-HNE adduct and does not bind to the 6-carbon 4-HHE adducts (Fig. S1C), allowing for enrichment of proteins and peptides carrying specific linkages. To identify carbonylated proteins that accumulate in the nucleus, we isolated nuclei from eWAT depots from obese C57Bl/6J mice. We analyzed unenriched samples and samples enriched for adducts at both the protein and the peptide level before proteomic analysis to identify peptides carrying 4-HNE adducts (Fig. 2A). Shown in Fig. 2A are the linear structures of the Michael adduct formed between 4-HNE and target amino acids. It should be noted that linear lipid aldehydes adducted onto proteins typically cyclize to form the more stable hemiacetal (27Nadkarni D.V. Sayre L.M. Structural definition of early lysine and histidine adduction chemistry of 4-hydroxynonenal.Chem. Res.

However, in the workflow, we reduced all adducts with sodium borohydride to allow for efficient immunoaffinity capture. Through this workflow, we identified 65 proteins and 90 sites of 4-HNE modification (Fig. 2B and Table S2). 4-HHE is a reactive lipid that is closely related to 4-HNE and has been studied at length for its role in oxidative stress-related outcomes (28Awada M.

As such, we also searched for 4-HHE modifications and identified 115 sites on 57 distinct proteins (Fig. 2B and Table S3). Representative spectra for 4-HNE and 4-HHE modifications are shown in Fig. S1 (D and E, respectively). Because the antibody we used for enrichment is specific for the 9-carbon adduct, this suggests that carbonylated proteins in the nucleus may be organized in a complex or physically associate with each other. Interestingly, we did not identify any overlapping proteins or sites for both 4-HNE and 4-HHE modification, suggesting that despite their chemical similarly, these lipids display distinct molecular protein targets. Analysis of the sites of modifications revealed a roughly equal distribution between lysine, histidine, and cysteine modifications, suggesting that neither 4-HNE nor 4-HHE exhibits a side chain preference (Fig. 2C). It should be noted that in this workflow analysis, histones were excluded. We have found that histones are a major nuclear carbonylation target, and specifics as to their sites, specificity, and biological impact will be reported separately. Molecular function analysis (PANTHER) of all sites identified revealed that roughly one-third of proteins identified exhibit enzymatic activity (Fig. 2D, top). The remaining proteins cluster into a variety of categories, including a large number of nucleic acid–binding proteins (Fig. 2D, bottom). To further assess the physiological significance of carbonylation in the nucleus, we performed pathway gene ontology analysis of the combined (4-HNE and 4-HHE) protein data set. Interestingly, there was no significant enrichment for biological processes or KEGG pathways (Fig. 2D (top) and Table S4). In molecular function enrichment analysis, we found that carbonylation substrates were highly enriched for metal-binding proteins (adjusted p = 1.2 × 10−7), nucleic acid–binding proteins (adjusted p = 9.7 × 10−5), and zinc ion–binding proteins (adjusted p = 0.005). In addition, keyword enrichment analysis and sequence feature analysis revealed that zinc finger–containing proteins were the most highly enriched class of proteins (adjusted p = 2.6 × 10−12) (Fig. 2D (bottom) and Table S4). Using our data set containing over 100 carbonylated proteins, we evaluated the amino acid sequence flanking each carbonylation site to determine whether there are sequence motifs that are enriched at 4-HNE or 4-HHE sites. First, we calculated the occurrence of each amino acid surrounding the modification from the −7 to +7 positions (Fig. 3, A–C). This analysis revealed a strong preference for cysteine at the +3 position and a cysteine or proline at the −3 position for both 4-HNE and 4-HHE cysteine modifications (Fig. 3A). Whereas the 4-HNE and 4-HHE cysteine modifications displayed clear similarities in their flanking sequences, the lysine and histidine modifications did not. 4-HNE lysine modifications showed a strong preference for polar charged residues in the −2, −1, +1, and +2 positions (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the 4-HHE lysine adduct was more commonly surrounded by hydrophobic residues on both sides (Fig. 3B). 4-HNE histidine adducts were flanked by polar uncharged residues on the N terminus, whereas the 4-HHE modification was surrounded primarily by hydrophobic residues on both sides (Fig. 3C). Overall, lysine enrichment in the flanking sequences for all modifications was particularly notable. Analysis of combined lysine content f"

Uremic patients tend to accumulate toxins in their body and have poor functional status. We investigated the associations between PFCs and the clinical profile of uremic patients under hemodialysis (HD). Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry coupled with isotope dilution was used to quantify PFOA and PFOS. We enrolled 126 patients under regular HD. Compared with previous research, the concentration of PFOA was lower, but that of PFOS was higher in uremic patients than in the general population. The levels of PFOA and PFOS in uremic patients before dialysis were 0.52 (ng/ml) and 21.84 (ng/ml) respectively. The PFOA level remained unchanged but that of PFOS decreased to1.85 ng/mL after dialysis. PFOS can be removed by HD. Patients using hypertensive medication had a lower PFOS then those who did not. The PFOS level was negatively correlated with the duration of the HD session and patient performance status, but positively correlated with levels of cholesterol, chloride (an indicator of acidemia), ferritin, and total protein. (p<0.05). The association with serum protein may explain the long half-life of PFCs in humans.

Both canine and human HSA exhibit sustained aberrant PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway signaling. The purpose of this study was to examine the in vitro effects of a novel dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, VDC-597, in three canine HSA cell lines (DEN-, CIN-, and SB-HSA). VDC-597 suppressed activation of both Akt and 4eBP1 in canine HSA cells in a dose-dependent fashion, with an IC50 of approximately 0.3 uM, a concentration predicted to be clinically achievable based on preliminary early-phase canine and human studies. VDC-597 dose-dependently reduced proliferation, migration, and vascular endothelial growth factor production in HSA cells, while promoting tumor cell apoptosis. VDC-597 demonstrated additive antiproliferative effects when combined with doxorubicin. These results suggest that inhibitors of the PI3K/mTOR pathway may act against multiple components of the neoplastic process, including proliferation/apoptosis, chemosensitivity, migration, and angiogenesis, and justify the evaluation of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in canine, and potentially human, HSA."

However, the factors that create barriers to or promote chewing cessation are not well understood. This study aims to explore the behavioral changes of betel quid chewers who have been diagnosed with oral cancer within a transtheoretical model framework. Thirty oral cancer patients with betel quid chewing history were chosen for in-depth interviews. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the data and identify themes that described the behavioral changes of betel quid cessation. Our research showed that betel quid chewers with oral cancer typically experience four significant stages of behavior: pre-contemplation, contemplation, action, and maintenance. Each stage change was marked by specific characteristics. At first, chewers showed positive attitudes toward the psychoactive or social effects of betel quid. They then realized the negative effects of betel quid, such as dental or other physical problems. Some also realized that they were addicted to betel quid. When they decided to quit, most chewers reported going ""cold turkey."" Some chewers successfully quit betel quid and attributed it to willpower. Those quitting because of the loss of oral functions were unable to chew anymore, though some chewers had experienced a relapse. In the maintenance stage, ex-chewers reported overcoming their addiction; however, relapse was possible. In this study, those who quit betel quid because of oral cancer usually quit tobacco and alcohol as well, with a lesser chance of recurrence. As the maintenance of chewing betel quid is multifactorial, this study provides information for betel quid cessation and oral cancer prevention."

This study investigated the prevalence, risk factors, and HIV-1 subtypes, including recombinant forms and mutations associated with drug resistance, among crack cocaine users in Central-West Brazil. We recruited 600 crack cocaine users admitted to a referral hospital in Goiânia for psychiatric disorders. The participants were interviewed; blood samples were collected for anti-HIV-1/2 serological screening. HIV-1 pol gene sequences (entire protease [PR] and partial reverse transcriptase [RT]) were obtained from plasma RNA. HIV-1 subtypes, recombinant viruses, transmitted drug resistance (TDR), and secondary drug resistance mutations were investigated. The median participant age was 30 years (range, 18–68 years); most were male, single, unemployed, and of mixed races. Among them, 2.8% (17/600) were HIV-1 positive: 2.2% of men (11/507) and 6.5% of women (6/93). The main predictors of HIV-1 seropositivity were a sexual partner with HIV infection, irregular condom use, and previous homelessness. HIV-1 pol sequences (12/17) indicated the predominance of subtype B (n = 7), followed by recombinant forms FPR/BRT (n = 1) and BPR/FRT (n = 2) and subtypes F1 (n = 1) and C (n = 1). TDR prevalence was 58.3% (7/12). Isolates from two participants showed mutations associated with resistance to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) only (M41L, T125C, T125F, M184V), while an isolate from one patient who had received antiretroviral therapy (ART) since 2008 had a mutation associated with resistance to non-NRTI (G190S). Five isolates had secondary mutations to protease inhibitors (K20M, L10V, L33I, A71T, A71V). In conclusion, the findings of HIV-1 circulation, TDR to NRTI, and secondary mutations to protease inhibitors in ART-naïve crack cocaine users support the importance of monitoring this population in regions far from the epicenter of the HIV epidemic."
https://openalex.org/W2884993552,"Systemic autoimmune rheumatic disorders (SARD) represent important causes of morbidity and mortality in humans. The mechanisms triggering autoimmune responses are complex and involve a network of genetic factors. Mercury-induced autoimmunity (HgIA) in mice is an established model to study the mechanisms of the development of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), which is a hallmark in the diagnosis of SARD. A.SW mice with HgIA show a significantly higher titer of antinucleolar antibodies (ANoA) than the B10.S mice, although both share the same MHC class II (H-2). We applied a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to their Hg-exposed F2 offspring to investigate the non-MHC genes involved in the development of ANoA. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis showed a peak logarithm of odds ratio (LOD) score of 3.05 on chromosome 3. Microsatellites were used for haplotyping, and fine mapping was conducted with next generation sequencing. The candidate genes Bank1 (B-cell scaffold protein with ankyrin repeats 1) and Nfkb1 (nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1) were identified by additional QTL analysis. Expression of the Bank1 and Nfkb1 genes and their downstream target genes involved in the intracellular pathway (Tlr9, Il6, Tnf) was investigated in mercury-exposed A.SW and B10.S mice by real-time PCR. Bank1 showed significantly lower gene expression in the A.SW strain after Hg-exposure, whereas the B10.S strain showed no significant difference. Nfkb1, Tlr9, Il6 and Tnf had significantly higher gene expression in the A.SW strain after Hg-exposure, while the B10.S strain showed no difference. This study supports the roles of Bank1 (produced mainly in B-cells) and Nfkb1 (produced in most immune cells) as key regulators of ANoA development in HgIA."
https://openalex.org/W2950692233,"Transcription factors (TFs) often work cooperatively, where the binding of one TF to DNA enhances the binding affinity of a second TF to a nearby location. Such cooperative binding is important for activating gene expression from promoters and enhancers in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Existing methods to detect cooperative binding of a TF pair rely on analyzing the sequence that is bound. We propose a method that uses, instead, only ChIP-seq peak intensities and an expectation maximization (CPI-EM) algorithm. We validate our method using ChIP-seq data from cells where one of a pair of TFs under consideration has been genetically knocked out. Our algorithm relies on our observation that cooperative TF-TF binding is correlated with weak binding of one of the TFs, which we demonstrate in a variety of cell types, including E. coli, S. cerevisiae and M. musculus cells. We show that this method performs significantly better than a predictor based only on the ChIP-seq peak distance of the TFs under consideration. This suggests that peak intensities contain information that can help detect the cooperative binding of a TF pair. CPI-EM also outperforms an existing sequence-based algorithm in detecting cooperative binding. The CPI-EM algorithm is available at https://github.com/vishakad/cpi-em."
https://openalex.org/W2884535093,"It has long been known that antipsychotic drugs (ATP) causes tachycardia, however details such as the differences between ATP are not well known. In recent years, the relationship between the rise in resting heart rate (RHR) and the increased risk of death in the general population has been garnering attention. In this study, we examined the difference in action on RHR between olanzapine (OLZ) and aripiprazole (ARP). The changes in the RHR on switching from OLZ to ARP and on increasing from the starting OLZ dose to the final one were evaluated in 19 outpatients (Study 1) and in 29 outpatients with schizophrenia (Study 2), respectively. To analyze the RHR, electrocardiographic measurements were obtained. At the same day, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) was evaluated, and fasting blood samples were drawn after an overnight fast of at least 8 h to examine electrolytes. Both Study 1 and 2 were conducted with the approval of the Gene Ethics Committee of Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, and the patients were treated at the outpatient psychiatric clinic at Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital. All patients had been diagnosed with schizophrenia based on the DSM-IV-TR. In the Study 1, OLZ of 14.6 ± 9.2mg (mean ± standard deviation) was switched to ARP of 20.8 ± 8.1mg. Significant decreases were observed in the mean RHR after the switch to ARP (73.7 ± 9.7 vs 65.8 ± 10.9 beats/min, p = 0.008). In the Study 2, the starting OLZ dose was 7.2 ± 3.2mg and the increasing OLZ dose was 18.3 ± 7.4mg. Significant increases were observed in the mean RHR after increasing OLZ (69.7 ± 14.0 vs 75.6 ± 14.3 beats/min, p = 0.004). In this study, it was shown that OLZ has a stronger RHR enhancing effect compared to ARP and its effects are dose-dependent. If the increase in RHR increases the mortality rate of patients with schizophrenia, it may be necessary to further investigate the differences between ATP in terms of the effect on RHR of second-generation antipsychotics with a strong anticholinergic action or phenothiazine antipsychotics."
https://openalex.org/W2884890458,"To our knowledge, there are no studies about the structure and ecological function of extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) in Opuntia robusta. This is the first description of EFNs in O. robusta, where young spines have an interesting structure and a secreting function, which are different from EFNs described in other Cactaceae species. We used light, scanning-electron, and transmission-electron microscopy to examine morphology, anatomy, and ultrastructure of the secretory spines in areoles in female and hermaphrodite individuals of O. robusta. Young cladodes develop areoles with modified and secretory spines as EFNs only active during the early growth phase. EFNs are non-vascularized structures, with no stomata, that consist of a basal meristematic tissue, a middle elongation region, and an apical secretory cone formed by large globular epidermal cells, containing nectar and medullar elongated cells. We observed the presence of Golgi apparatus, vesicles and plastids in the medullar and sup-epidermal cells of the spine. We propose that the nectar is stored in the globular cells at the apex of the spine and secreted by breaking through the globular cells or by pores. We recorded a more frequent presence of ants on younger cladode sprouts producing young secreting spines: this result is parallel with the predictions of Optimal Defense Hypothesis, which states that younger plant organs should be better defended than older ones because their loss produces a higher fitness impairment. Although Diaz-Castelazo’s hypothesis states that a more complex structure of EFNs correlates with their lower among-organs dispersion, comparing to less complex EFNs, non-vascularized structure of EFNs in O. robusta is not associated with their higher among-organs dispersion likened to O. stricta, which produces vascularized EFNs. We provide evidence that this characteristic is not a good taxonomic feature of Opuntia genus. Moreover, the comparison of EFNs of O. robusta and O. stricta suggests that the hypothesis of Diaz-Castelazo should be revised: it is rather a rule but not a law."
https://openalex.org/W2884177497,"It has yet to be firmly established whether host IFNL3 (IL28B) genotype influences interferon responsiveness in patients with chronic hepatitis B. We investigated associations between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IFNL3 region and response to peginterferon alfa-2a in 701 patients enrolled in three large, randomized, international studies.Responses were defined as hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss and/or hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) seroconversion plus hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA <2000 IU/ml in HBeAg-positive patients, and HBsAg loss and/or HBV DNA <2000 IU/ml in HBeAg-negative patients (24 weeks after end of treatment). Associations between treatment response and the number of copies of the poor-response allele at three SNPs (rs8099917, rs12980275, rs12979860) were explored with logistic regression models in Asian and white patients.The HBeAg-positive and -negative populations comprised 465 (92% Asian, 50% HBV genotype C) and 236 (79% Asian, 41% HBV genotype C) patients, respectively, and had respective response rates of 26% and 47%. The IFNL3 genotype was strongly associated with ethnicity. There was no association between IFNL3 genotype and treatment response in HBeAg-positive or -negative patients. Independent predictors of treatment response were: sex, HBV DNA level and alanine aminotransferase level in HBeAg-positive Asian patients; age in HBeAg-negative Asian patients; and HBV DNA in HBeAg-negative white patients.This is the largest analysis to date of associations between IFNL3 genotype and peginterferon response in patients with chronic hepatitis B. The data suggest that IFNL3 polymorphism is not a major determinant of the response to peginterferon alfa-2a in either HBeAg-positive or HBeAg-negative patients."
https://openalex.org/W2883567792,"Theoretical approaches suggest that gender inequity increases men’s health risks. Previous findings from the United States support this contention, however only a small number of health outcomes have been explored. This study extends the range of health outcomes examined by using a cross-sectional, multilevel analysis to investigate whether measures of state-level gender inequity are predictors of men’s self-rated health. Data were derived primarily from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and the full-case data set included 116,594 individuals nested within 50 states. Gender inequity was measured with nine variables: higher education, women’s reproductive rights, abortion provider access, elected office, management, business ownership, labour force participation, earnings and relative poverty. Covariates at the individual level were age, income, education, race/ethnicity, marital status and employment status. Covariates at the state level were income inequality and gross domestic product per capita. In fully adjusted models for all-age men the reproductive rights (OR 1.06 95% CI 1.01–1.11), abortion provider access (OR 1.11 95% CI 1.05–1.16) and earnings (OR 1.06 95% CI 1.02–1.12) measures all predicted an increased risk of men reporting poorer self-rated health for each 1 standard deviation increase in the gender inequity z-score. The most consistent effect was seen for the 65+ age group where the reproductive rights (OR 1.09 95% CI 1.03–1.16), abortion provider access (OR 1.15 95% CI 1.09–1.21), elected office (OR 1.06 95% CI 1.01–1.11) and earnings (OR 1.10 95% CI 1.04–1.16) measures all showed a significant effect. These findings provide evidence that some aspects of gender inequity increase the risk of poorer self-rated health in men. The study contributes to a growing body of literature implicating gender inequity in men’s health patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2883941093,"In the West Gulf Coastal Plains (WGCP) northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) are declining faster than range-wide averages and such declines have been linked to the consequences of land management. Management for the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) has benefitted northern bobwhite by restoring mature pine-grassland ecosystems in some areas of the region. However, at Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge, Crossett, Arkansas, USA, the bobwhite population was not increasing despite the availability of seemingly suitable habitat from management for the endangered species. To understand factors that may be affecting bobwhite survival on Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge we conducted a telemetry study and assessed summer survival, brood survival, and nest success from 1 April- 11 August in 2013 and 1 April- 15 August in 2014. We also calculated home-range sizes and measured microhabitat characteristics around nests. Summer survival rates were 71% (SE = 0.17) and 47% (SE = 0.14); while nest success was 47% (SE = 0.02) and 100% for 2013 and 2014, respectively. Between years, both 95% and 50% kernel home-ranges were not different (pooled, 63.92±6.07 ha and 14.94±1.75 ha); however minimum convex polygon home-range sizes were (113.8 ± 20.1 ha in 2013; and 393.1 ± 49.0 ha in 2014, P < 0.001). Only numerical differences in microhabitat vegetation characteristics of nest sites and non- nest sites were observed. We suggest management for red-cockaded woodpeckers supports bobwhite populations but only as a buffer against more severe declines. Since bobwhites are declining range-wide, we believe areas federally managed for red-cockaded woodpeckers will become increasingly more important for sustaining regional bobwhite population levels."
https://openalex.org/W2884451414,"Most HIV-infected patients who initiate combination antiretroviral therapy experience a viral load decline in several phases. These phases are characterized by different rates of viral load decay that decrease when transitioning from one phase to the next. There is no consensus as to the origin of these phases. One hypothesis put forward is that short- and long-lived infected cells are responsible for the first and second phases of decay, respectively. However, significant differences in drug concentrations are observed in monocytes from various tissues, suggesting the first two phases of decay in viral loads could instead be attributed to short-lived cells being differently exposed to drugs. Compared to a well-exposed compartment, new cell infection can be expected in a compartment with limited drug exposure, thus leading to a slower viral load decay with potential virologic failure and drug resistance. In the current study, the latter hypothesis was investigated using a model of viral kinetics. Empirical datasets were involved in model elaboration and parameter estimation. In particular, susceptibility assay data was used for an in vitro to in vivo extrapolation based on the expected drug concentrations inside physiological compartments. Results from numerical experiments of the short-term evolution of viral loads can reproduce the first two phases of viral decay when allowing new short-lived cell infections in an unidentified drug-limited compartment. Model long-term predictions are however less consistent with clinical observations. For the hypothesis to hold, efavirenz, tenofovir and emtricitabine drug exposure in the drug-limited compartment would have to be very low compared to exposure in peripheral blood. This would lead to significant long-term viral growth and the frequent development of resistant strains, a prediction not supported by clinical observations. This suggests that the existence of a drug-limited anatomical compartment is unlikely, by itself, to explain the second phase of viral load decay."
