https://openalex.org/W3210475044,"Abstract Patients with heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) have a high burden of symptoms and functional limitations, and have a poor quality of life. By targeting cardiometabolic abmormalities, sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may improve these impairments. In this multicenter, randomized trial of patients with HFpEF (NCT03030235), we evaluated whether the SGLT2 inhibitor dapagliflozin improves the primary endpoint of Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire Clinical Summary Score (KCCQ-CS), a measure of heart failure-related health status, at 12 weeks after treatment initiation. Secondary endpoints included the 6-minute walk test (6MWT), KCCQ Overall Summary Score (KCCQ-OS), clinically meaningful changes in KCCQ-CS and -OS, and changes in weight, natriuretic peptides, glycated hemoglobin and systolic blood pressure. In total, 324 patients were randomized to dapagliflozin or placebo. Dapagliflozin improved KCCQ-CS (effect size, 5.8 points (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.3–9.2, P = 0.001), meeting the predefined primary endpoint, due to improvements in both KCCQ total symptom score (KCCQ-TS) (5.8 points (95% CI 2.0–9.6, P = 0.003)) and physical limitations scores (5.3 points (95% CI 0.7–10.0, P = 0.026)). Dapagliflozin also improved 6MWT (mean effect size of 20.1 m (95% CI 5.6–34.7, P = 0.007)), KCCQ-OS (4.5 points (95% CI 1.1–7.8, P = 0.009)), proportion of participants with 5-point or greater improvements in KCCQ-OS (odds ratio (OR) = 1.73 (95% CI 1.05–2.85, P = 0.03)) and reduced weight (mean effect size, 0.72 kg (95% CI 0.01–1.42, P = 0.046)). There were no significant differences in other secondary endpoints. Adverse events were similar between dapagliflozin and placebo (44 (27.2%) versus 38 (23.5%) patients, respectively). These results indicate that 12 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment significantly improved patient-reported symptoms, physical limitations and exercise function and was well tolerated in chronic HFpEF."
https://openalex.org/W3210601686,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many variants associated with complex traits, but identifying the causal gene(s) is a major challenge. In the present study, we present an open resource that provides systematic fine mapping and gene prioritization across 133,441 published human GWAS loci. We integrate genetics (GWAS Catalog and UK Biobank) with transcriptomic, proteomic and epigenomic data, including systematic disease–disease and disease–molecular trait colocalization results across 92 cell types and tissues. We identify 729 loci fine mapped to a single-coding causal variant and colocalized with a single gene. We trained a machine-learning model using the fine-mapped genetics and functional genomics data and 445 gold-standard curated GWAS loci to distinguish causal genes from neighboring genes, outperforming a naive distance-based model. Our prioritized genes were enriched for known approved drug targets (odds ratio = 8.1, 95% confidence interval = 5.7, 11.5). These results are publicly available through a web portal ( http://genetics.opentargets.org ), enabling users to easily prioritize genes at disease-associated loci and assess their potential as drug targets. Open Targets Genetics is a community resource that provides systematic fine mapping at human GWAS loci, enabling users to prioritize genes at disease-associated regions and assess their potential as drug targets."

https://openalex.org/W3208849487,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a relentless neurodegenerative disease of the human motor neuron system, where variability in progression rate limits clinical trial efficacy. Therefore, better prognostication will facilitate therapeutic progress. In this study, we investigated the potential of plasma cell-free microRNAs (miRNAs) as ALS prognostication biomarkers in 252 patients with detailed clinical phenotyping. First, we identified, in a longitudinal cohort, miRNAs whose plasma levels remain stable over the course of disease. Next, we showed that high levels of miR-181, a miRNA enriched in neurons, predicts a greater than two-fold risk of death in independent discovery and replication cohorts (126 and 122 patients, respectively). miR-181 performance is similar to neurofilament light chain (NfL), and when combined together, miR-181 + NfL establish a novel RNA–protein biomarker pair with superior prognostication capacity. Therefore, plasma miR-181 alone and a novel miRNA–protein biomarker approach, based on miR-181 + NfL, boost precision of patient stratification. miR-181-based ALS biomarkers encourage additional validation and might enhance the power of clinical trials. Magen et al. discovered new miRNA-based biomarkers in the blood of patients with ALS. miR-181 levels alone or in combination with an established protein biomarker predict ALS severity and prognosis and might enhance the power of clinical trials."

https://openalex.org/W3210280718,"The neuropeptide substance P (SP) is important in pain and inflammation. SP activates the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) to signal via Gq and Gs proteins. Neurokinin A also activates NK1R, but leads to selective Gq signaling. How two stimuli yield distinct G protein signaling at the same G protein-coupled receptor remains unclear. We determined cryogenic-electron microscopy structures of active NK1R bound to SP or the Gq-biased peptide SP6–11. Peptide interactions deep within NK1R are critical for receptor activation. Conversely, interactions between SP and NK1R extracellular loops are required for potent Gs signaling but not Gq signaling. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that these superficial contacts restrict SP flexibility. SP6–11, which lacks these interactions, is dynamic while bound to NK1R. Structural dynamics of NK1R agonists therefore depend on interactions with the receptor extracellular loops and regulate G protein signaling selectivity. Similar interactions between other neuropeptides and their cognate receptors may tune intracellular signaling. Determination of the cryo-EM structures of active neurokinin-1 receptor bound to substance P or the Gq biased peptide SP6–11 reveals that interactions with the receptor extracellular loops regulate G protein signaling selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W3208651536,"The ability to control translation of endogenous or exogenous RNAs in eukaryotic cells would facilitate a variety of biotechnological applications. Current strategies are limited by low fold changes in transgene output and the size of trigger RNAs (trRNAs). Here we introduce eukaryotic toehold switches (eToeholds) as modular riboregulators. eToeholds contain internal ribosome entry site sequences and form inhibitory loops in the absence of a specific trRNA. When the trRNA is present, eToeholds anneal to it, disrupting the inhibitory loops and allowing translation. Through optimization of RNA annealing, we achieved up to 16-fold induction of transgene expression in mammalian cells. We demonstrate that eToeholds can discriminate among viral infection status, presence or absence of gene expression and cell types based on the presence of exogenous or endogenous RNA transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W3210040697,"Background Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, many pharmaceutical companies have been racing to develop a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. Simultaneously, rumors and misinformation about COVID-19 are still widely spreading. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 misinformation among the Yemeni population and its association with vaccine acceptance and perceptions. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in four major cities in Yemen. The constructed questionnaire consisted of four main sections (sociodemographic data, misinformation, perceptions (perceived susceptibility, severity, and worry), and vaccination acceptance evaluation). Subject recruitment and data collection were conducted online utilizing social websites and using the snowball sampling technique. Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed using SPSS version 27. Results The total number of respondents was 484. Over 60% of them were males and had a university education. More than half had less than 100$ monthly income and were khat chewers, while only 18% were smokers. Misinformation prevalence ranged from 8.9% to 38.9%, depending on the statement being asked. Men, university education, higher income, employment, and living in urban areas were associated with a lower misinformation level ( p &lt;0.05). Statistically significant association ( p &lt;0.05) between university education, living in urban areas, and being employed with perceived susceptibility were observed. The acceptance rate was 61.2% for free vaccines, but it decreased to 43% if they had to purchase it. Females, respondents with lower monthly income, and those who believed that pharmaceutical companies made the virus for financial gains were more likely to reject the vaccination ( p &lt;0.05). Conclusion The study revealed that the acceptance rate to take a vaccine was suboptimal and significantly affected by gender, misinformation, cost, and income. Furthermore, being female, non-university educated, low-income, and living in rural areas were associated with higher susceptibility to misinformation about COVID-19. These findings show a clear link between misinformation susceptibility and willingness to vaccinate. Focused awareness campaigns to decrease misinformation and emphasize the vaccination’s safety and efficacy might be fundamental before initiating any mass vaccination in Yemen."

https://openalex.org/W3208370655,"Gene amplification drives oncogenesis in a broad spectrum of cancers. A number of drugs have been developed to inhibit the protein products of amplified driver genes, but their clinical efficacy is often hampered by drug resistance. Here, we introduce a therapeutic strategy for targeting cancer-associated gene amplifications by activating the DNA damage response with triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs), which drive the induction of apoptosis in tumors, whereas cells without amplifications process lower levels of DNA damage. Focusing on cancers driven by HER2 amplification, we find that TFOs targeting HER2 induce copy number-dependent DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and activate p53-independent apoptosis in HER2-positive cancer cells and human tumor xenografts via a mechanism that is independent of HER2 cellular function. This strategy has demonstrated in vivo efficacy comparable to that of current precision medicines and provided a feasible alternative to combat drug resistance in HER2-positive breast and ovarian cancer models. These findings offer a general strategy for targeting tumors with amplified genomic loci."

https://openalex.org/W3209851239,"Reverse translation of polypeptide sequences to expressible mRNA constructs is a NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. Each amino acid in the protein sequence can be represented by as many as six codons, and the process of selecting the combination that maximizes probability of expression is termed codon optimization. This work investigates the potential impact of leveraging quantum computing technology for codon optimization. A Quantum Annealer (QA) is compared to a standard genetic algorithm (GA) programmed with the same objective function. The QA is found to be competitive in identifying optimal solutions. The utility of gate-based systems is also evaluated using a simulator resulting in the finding that while current generations of devices lack the hardware requirements, in terms of both qubit count and connectivity, to solve realistic problems, future generation devices may be highly efficient."
https://openalex.org/W3210225758,"Abstract Disease progression and therapeutic resistance of prostate cancer (PC) are linked to multiple molecular events that promote survival and plasticity. We previously showed that heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) acted as a driver of castration-resistant phenotype (CRPC) and developed an oligonucleotides antisense (ASO) against HSP27 with evidence of anti-cancer activity in men with CRPC. Here, we show that the tumor suppressor Menin ( MEN1 ) is highly regulated by HSP27. Menin is overexpressed in high-grade PC and CRPC. High MEN1 mRNA expression is associated with decreased biochemical relapse-free and overall survival. Silencing Menin with ASO technology inhibits CRPC cell proliferation, tumor growth, and restores chemotherapeutic sensitivity. ChIP-seq analysis revealed differential DNA binding sites of Menin in various prostatic cells, suggesting a switch from tumor suppressor to oncogenic functions in CRPC. These data support the evaluation of ASO against Menin for CRPC."
https://openalex.org/W3208317563,"Population-based genomic screening is at the forefront of a new approach to disease prevention. Yet the lack of diversity in genome wide association studies and ongoing debates about the appropriate use of racial and ethnic categories in genomics raise key questions about the translation of genomic knowledge into clinical practice. This article reports on an ethnographic study of a large pragmatic clinical trial of breast cancer screening called WISDOM (Women Informed to Screen Depending On Measures of Risk). Our ethnography illuminates the challenges of using race or ethnicity as a risk factor in the implementation of precision breast cancer risk assessment. Our analysis provides critical insights into how categories of race, ethnicity and ancestry are being deployed in the production of genomic knowledge and medical practice, and key challenges in the development and implementation of novel Polygenic Risk Scores in the research and clinical applications of this emerging science. Specifically, we show how the conflation of social and biological categories of difference can influence risk prediction for individuals who exist at the boundaries of these categories, affecting the perceptions and practices of scientists, clinicians, and research participants themselves. Our research highlights the potential harms of practicing genomic medicine using under-theorized and ambiguous categories of race, ethnicity, and ancestry, particularly in an adaptive, pragmatic trial where research findings are applied in the clinic as they emerge. We contribute to the expanding literature on categories of difference in post-genomic science by closely examining the implementation of a large breast cancer screening study that aims to personalize breast cancer risk using both common and rare genomic markers."
https://openalex.org/W3208789981,"Background Worldwide, strict infection control measures including visitation regulations were implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic at Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). These regulations gave restricted access for parents to their hospitalized infants. The consequence was limited ability to involve in the care of their infants. At Oslo University Hospital entry to NICU was denied to all except healthy mothers in March 2020. The absolute access ban for fathers lasted for 10 weeks. The aim of this study was to explore parental experiences with an infant hospitalized in the NICU during this absolute visitation ban period. Methods We invited post discharge all parents of surviving infants that had been hospitalized for at least 14 days to participate. They were interviewed during autumn 2020 using an explorative semi-structured interview approach. Data were analyzed via inductive thematic analysis. Results Nine mothers and four fathers participated. The COVID-19 regulations strongly impacted the parent’s experiences of their stay. The fathers’ limited access felt life-impacting. Parents struggled to become a family and raised their voices to be heard. Not being able to experience parenthood together led to emotional loneliness. The fathers struggled to learn how to care for their infant. The regulations might lead to a postponed attachment. On the other hand, of positive aspect the parents got some quietness. Being hospitalized during this first wave was experienced as exceptional and made parents seeking alliances by other parents. Social media was used to keep in contact with the outside world. Conclusions The regulations had strong negative impact on parental experiences during the NICU hospitalization. The restriction to fathers’ access to the NICU acted as a significant obstacle to early infant-father bonding and led to loneliness and isolation by the mothers. Thus, these COVID-19 measures might have had adverse consequences for families."
https://openalex.org/W3209290247,"Background The bidirectional relationship between health behavior and subjective well-being has previously been studied sparsely, and mainly for individual health behaviors and regression models. In the present study, we deepen this knowledge focusing on the four principal health behaviors and using structural equation modeling with selected covariates. Methods The follow-up data (n = 11,804) was derived from a population-based random sample of working-age Finns from two waves (2003 and 2012) of the Health and Social Support (HeSSup) postal survey. Structural equation modeling was used to study the cross-sectional, cross-lagged, and longitudinal relationships between the four principal health behaviors and subjective well-being at baseline and after the nine-year follow-up adjusted for age, gender, education, and self-reported diseases. The included health behaviors were physical activity, dietary habits, alcohol consumption, and smoking status. Subjective well-being was measured through four items comprising happiness, interest, and ease in life, and perceived loneliness. Results Bidirectionally, only health behavior in 2003 predicted subjective well-being in 2012, whereas subjective well-being in 2003 did not predict health behavior in 2012. In addition, the cross-sectional interactions in 2003 and in 2012 between health behavior and subjective well-being were statistically significant. The baseline levels predicted their respective follow-up levels, the effect being stronger in health behavior than in subjective well-being. Conclusion The four principal health behaviors together predict subsequent subjective well-being after an extensive follow-up. Although not particularly strong, the results could still be used for motivation for health behavior change, because of the beneficial effects of health behavior on subjective well-being."
https://openalex.org/W3210066591,"Urbanisation alters landscapes, introduces wildlife to novel stressors, and fragments habitats into remnant ‘islands’. Within these islands, isolated wildlife populations can experience genetic drift and subsequently suffer from inbreeding depression and reduced adaptive potential. The Western tiger snake ( Notechis scutatus occidentalis ) is a predator of wetlands in the Swan Coastal Plain, a unique bioregion that has suffered substantial degradation through the development of the city of Perth, Western Australia. Within the urban matrix, tiger snakes now only persist in a handful of wetlands where they are known to bioaccumulate a suite of contaminants, and have recently been suggested as a relevant bioindicator of ecosystem health. Here, we used genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data to explore the contemporary population genomics of seven tiger snake populations across the urban matrix. Specifically, we used population genomic structure and diversity, effective population sizes (N e ), and heterozygosity-fitness correlations to assess fitness of each population with respect to urbanisation. We found that population genomic structure was strongest across the northern and southern sides of a major river system, with the northern cluster of populations exhibiting lower heterozygosities than the southern cluster, likely due to a lack of historical gene flow. We also observed an increasing signal of inbreeding and genetic drift with increasing geographic isolation due to urbanisation. Effective population sizes ( N e ) at most sites were small (&lt; 100), with N e appearing to reflect the area of available habitat rather than the degree of adjacent urbanisation. This suggests that ecosystem management and restoration may be the best method to buffer the further loss of genetic diversity in urban wetlands. If tiger snake populations continue to decline in urban areas, our results provide a baseline measure of genomic diversity, as well as highlighting which ‘islands’ of habitat are most in need of management and protection."
https://openalex.org/W3210445677,"Environmental DNA (eDNA) is nuclear or mitochondrial DNA shed into the environment, and amplifying this DNA can serve as a reliable, noninvasive way to monitor aquatic systems for the presence of an invasive species. Assays based on the collection of eDNA are becoming increasingly popular, and, when optimized, can aid in effectively and efficiently tracking invasion fronts. We set out to update an eDNA assay to detect the invasive rusty crayfish, Faxonius rusticus. We tested for species specificity compared to other stream crayfish and field tested the assay at sites with known presence (N = 3) and absence (N = 4) in the Juniata River watershed in central Pennsylvania, USA. To maximize sensitivity, we field tested different storage buffers (Longmire's buffer and ethanol), DNA extraction methods (Qiagen's DNEasy and PowerWater kits), and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) chemistries (TaqMan and SYBR green). Our assay confirmed the presence data and performed optimally when filter samples were stored in Longmire's buffer, DNA was extracted with DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit, and TaqMan qPCR chemistry was utilized. With proper sample processing, our assay allows for accurate, noninvasive detection of F. rusticus in streams."
https://openalex.org/W3208481619,"Serum Paraoxonase 2 (PON2) level is a potential biomarker owing to its association with a number of pathophysiological conditions such as atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Since cholinergic deficiency is closely linked with Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are the treatment of choice for patients with AD. However, there is a heterogenous response to these drugs and mostly the subjects do not respond to the treatment. Gene polymorphism, the simultaneous occurrence of two or more discontinuous alleles in a population, could be one of the important factors for this. Hence, we hypothesized that PON2 and its polymorphic forms may be hydrolyzing the AChEIs differently, and thus, different patients respond differently. To investigate this, two AChEIs, donepezil hydrochloride (DHC) and pyridostigmine bromide (PB), were selected. Human PON2 wildtype gene and four mutants, two catalytic sites, and two polymorphic sites were cloned, recombinantly expressed, and purified for in vitro analysis. Enzyme activity and AChE activity were measured to quantitate the amount of DHC and PB hydrolyzed by the wildtype and the mutant proteins. Herein, PON2 esterase activity and AChE inhibitor efficiency were found to be inversely related. A significant difference in enzyme activity of the catalytic site mutants was observed as compared to the wildtype, and subsequent AChE activity showed that esterase activity of PON2 is responsible for the hydrolysis of DHC and PB. Interestingly, PON2 polymorphic site mutants showed increased esterase activity; therefore, this could be the reason for the ineffectiveness of the drugs. Thus, our data suggested that the esterase activity of PON2 was mainly responsible for the hydrolysis of AChEI, DHC, and PB, and that might be responsible for the variation in individual response to AChEI therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3209023487,"Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) is a highly contagious enteric viral disease of pigs with a high morbidity and mortality rate, which ultimately results in huge economic losses in the pig production sector. The etiological agent of this disease is the porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) which is an enveloped, positive single-stranded RNA virus. The aim of this study was to perform molecular characterization of PEDV to identify the strains circulating in Poland. In this study, 662 faecal samples from 2015 to 2021 were tested with reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and the results showed that 3.8% of the tested samples revealed a positive result for PEDV. A phylogenetic analysis of the complete genome and complete S gene sequences showed that Polish PEDV strains belonged to the G1b (S-INDEL) subgroup and were closely related to the European PEDV strains isolated from 2014 to 2019. Furthermore, RDP4 analysis revealed that the Polish PEDV strains harboured a recombinant fragment of ~400 nt in the 5' end of S gene with PEDV and swine enteric coronavirus (SeCoV) being the major and minor parents, respectively. Antigenic analysis showed that the aa sequences of neutralizing epitopes were conserved among the Polish PEDV strains. Only one strain, #0100/5P, had a unique substitution in the COE epitope. However, Polish PEDV strains showed several substitutions, especially in the COE antigen, as compared to the classical strain CV777. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report concerning the molecular characterization of porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus strains, as well as the first phylogenetic analysis for PEDV in Poland."
https://openalex.org/W3208602014,"The Carpathian Basin represents the cradle of human agricultural development during the Neolithic period, when large parts were transformed into ‘cultural landscapes’ by first farmers from the Balkans. It is assumed that an Early Neolithic subsistence economy established along the hydrologic systems and on Chernozem soil patches, which developed from loess deposits. However, recent results from soil chemistry and geoarchaeological analyses raised the hypothesis that extensive Chernozem coverage developed from increased land-use activity and that Early Neolithic ‘cultural’ groups were not restricted to loess-covered surfaces but rather preferred hydromorphic soils that formed in the floodplains. This article performs multivariable statistics from large datasets of Neolithic sites in Hungary and allows tracing Early to Late Neolithic site preferences from digital environmental data. Quantitative analyses reveal a strong preference for hydromorphic soils, a significant avoidance of loess-covered areas, and no preference for Chernozem soils throughout the Early Neolithic followed by a strong transformation of site preferences during the Late Neolithic period. These results align with socio-cultural developments, large-scale mobility patterns, and land-use and surface transformation, which shaped the Carpathian Basin and paved the way for the agricultural revolution across Europe."
https://openalex.org/W3208880843,"Influenza viruses cause respiratory tract infections and substantial health concerns. Infection may result in mild to severe respiratory disease associated with morbidity and some mortality. Several anti-influenza drugs are available, but these agents target viral components and are susceptible to drug resistance. There is a need for new antiviral drug strategies that include repurposing of clinically approved drugs. Drugs that target cellular machinery necessary for influenza virus replication can provide a means for inhibiting influenza virus replication. We used RNA interference screening to identify key host cell genes required for influenza replication, and then FDA-approved drugs that could be repurposed for targeting host genes. We examined the effects of Clopidogrel and Triamterene to inhibit A/WSN/33 (EC 50 5.84 uM and 31.48 uM, respectively), A/CA/04/09 (EC 50 6.432 uM and 3.32 uM, respectively), and B/Yamagata/16/1988 (EC 50 0.28 uM and 0.11 uM, respectively) replication. Clopidogrel and Triamterene provide a druggable approach to influenza treatment across multiple strains and subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W3210028636,"Care institutions are recognised to be a high-risk setting for the emergence and spread of infections and antimicrobial-resistant organisms, which stresses the importance of infection prevention and control (IPC). Accurate implementation is crucial for optimal IPC practice. Despite the wide promotion of IPC and research thereof in the hospital and nursing home setting, similar efforts are lacking in disability care settings. Therefore, this study aimed to assess perceived barriers and facilitators to IPC among professionals working at residential care facilities (RCFs) for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), as well as to identify professional-reported recommendations to improve IPC.This qualitative study involved semi-structured interviews (before COVID-19) with twelve professionals from five Dutch RCFs for people with IDD. An integrated theoretical approach was used to inform data collection and analysis. Thematic analysis using inductive and deductive approaches was conducted. This study followed the COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research (COREQ) guidelines.Our findings revealed barriers and facilitators at the guideline, client, professional, professional interaction, professional client interaction, client interaction, organisational, community, and societal level. Six main themes covering multiple barriers and facilitators were identified: (1) guidelines' applicability to (work)setting; (2) professionals' cognitions and attitude towards IPC (related to educational background); (3) organisational support and priority; (4) educational system; (5) time availability and staff capacity; and (6) task division and change coaches. The main professional-reported recommendations were the introduction of tailored and practical IPC guidelines, structural IPC education and training among all professionals, and client participation.To promote IPC, multifaceted and multilevel strategies should be implemented, with a preliminary need for improvements on the guideline, professional, and organisational level. Given the heterogeneous character, i.e., different professionals, clients and care needs, there is a need for a tailored approach to implement IPC and sustain it successfully in disability care. Our findings can inform future IPC practice improvements."
https://openalex.org/W3208150838,"Maps of bottom type are essential to the management of marine resources and biodiversity because of their foundational role in characterizing species' habitats. They are also urgently needed as countries work to define marine protected areas. Current approaches are time consuming, focus largely on grain size, and tend to overlook shallow waters. Our random forest classification of almost 200,000 observations of bottom type is a timely alternative, providing maps of coastal substrate at a combination of resolution and extents not previously achieved. We correlated the observations with depth, depth-derivatives, and estimates of energy to predict marine substrate at 100 m resolution for Canada's Pacific shelf, a study area of over 135,000 km2. We built five regional models with the same data at 20 m resolution. In addition to standard tests of model fit, we used three independent data sets to test model predictions. We also tested for regional, depth, and resolution effects. We guided our analysis by asking: 1) does weighting for prevalence improve model predictions? 2) does model resolution influence model performance? And 3) is model performance influenced by depth? All our models fit the build data well with true skill statistic (TSS) scores ranging from 0.56 to 0.64. Weighting models with class prevalence improved fit and the correspondence with known spatial features. Class-based metrics showed differences across both resolutions and spatial regions, indicating non-stationarity across these spatial categories. Predictive power was lower (TSS from 0.10 to 0.36) based on independent data evaluation. Model performance was also a function of depth and resolution, illustrating the challenge of accurately representing heterogeneity. Our work shows the value of regional analyses to assessing model stationarity and how independent data evaluation and the use of error metrics can improve understanding of model performance and sampling bias."
https://openalex.org/W3208177155,"Burnout is a syndrome of emotional exhaustion, low personal accomplishment and depersonalization experienced by a health professional and it is more common in nurses due to high workload and job stress that is mostly caused by working proximity to patients and taking care of them. Burnout compromises the provision of quality health care. Despite this, there is no information in Ethiopia on burnout among nurses in study area.To determine the magnitude of burnout and associated factors among nurses working in public hospitals of Harari regional state and Dire Dawa administration, eastern Ethiopia, February 1-29, 2020.Institutional based quantitative cross-sectional study was employed from February 1-29 among 412 randomly selected nurses who have been working in hospitals for the last 6 months. Simple random sampling method was employed and data was collected by self-administered, standardized, reliable and valid, questionnaire (Maslachs Burnout Inventory- Human Services Survey). Data was entered into EpiData Version 3.1 and exported to statistical package for social science version 20 for analysis. All covariate with P-value less than 0.25 in bivariable analysis were candidate for multivariable analysis. Level of statistical significance was declared at p-value < 0.05.Among 412 nurses taking part in this study, 183(44.4%) of nurses with 95% CI, had experienced burnout. Married marital status [AOR:2.3,95%CI:(1.2-4.3)], poor current health status [AOR:4.8, 95% CI:(1.1-21.4)] and fair current health status [AOR:12, 95% CI:(4.5-32)], working greater than eight hour per-day[AOR:0.52, 95%CI:(0.29-0.92)], intention to leave a job [AOR:0.48,95%CI:(0.2-0.88), being working in emergency room [AOR:0.3,95%CI:(0.1-0.98)] and using a different medication related to work related health problems were factors associated with nurses' burnout.The nurses' burnout in this study is high and it is attributed by marriage, perceiving health status as poor and fair, whereas, having the intention to leave job, being working in emergency room and using a medication in relation to work related health problems reduced risk of developing burnout. So, the concerned bodies should provide trainings which focus on stress copying mechanisms and assertiveness program."
https://openalex.org/W3209098945,"During the Paleolithic period, bone marrow extraction was an essential source of fat nutrients for hunter-gatherers especially throughout cold and dry seasons. This is attested by the recurrent findings of percussion marks in osteological material from anthropized archaeological levels. Among them some showed indicators that the marrow extraction process was part of a butchery cultural practice, meaning that the inflicted fracturing gestures and techniques were recurrent, standardized and counter-intuitive. In order to assess the weight of the counter-intuitive factor in the percussion mark pattern distribution, we carried out an experiment that by contrast focuses on the intuitive approach of fracturing bones to extract marrow, involving individual without experience in this activity. We wanted to evaluate the influence of bone morphology and the individuals’ behaviour on the distribution of percussion marks. Twelve experimenters broke 120 limb bones, a series of 10 bones per individual. During the experiment, information concerning the fracture of the bones as well as individual behaviour was collected and was subsequently compared to data from the laboratory study of the remains. Then, we applied an innovative GIS (Geographic Information System) method to analyze the distribution of percussion marks to highlight recurrent patterns. Results show that in spite of all the variables there is a high similarity in the distribution of percussion marks which we consider as intuitive patterns. The factor influenced the distribution for the humerus, radius-ulna and tibia series is the bone morphology, while for the femur series individual behaviour seems to have more weight in the distribution. To go further in the subject we need to compare the intuitive models with the distributions of percussion marks registered in fossil assemblages. Thus, it would be possible to propose new hypotheses on butchering practices based on the results presented in this work."

We wish to provide more molecular therapeutic targets for NSCLC.The NSCLC tissue and normal tissue samples were screened for genetic comparison in the TCGA database. The predicted lncRNA and mRNA in BEAS2B and A549 cells were detected.Volcano plot displayed differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in adjacent tissues and NSCLC tissues. The survival curve showed that the lncRNA and mRNA had a significant impact on the patient's survival. The results of GO term enrichment analysis indicated that mRNA functions were enriched in cell cycle-related pathways. In the ceRNA interaction network, 13 lncRNAs and 20 miRNAs were found to have an interactive relationship. Finally, 3 significantly different lncRNAs (LINC00968, lnc-FAM92A-9 and lnc-PTGFR-1) and 6 mRNAs (CTCFL, KRT5, LY6D, TMEM, GBP6, and TMEM179) with potential therapeutic significance were screened out. And the cell experiment verified our results.We screened out clinically significant 3 lncRNAs and 6 mRNAs involved in the ceRNA network, which were the key to our future research on the treatment of NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W3210808689,"This paper analyses the effect of mortality rates (under-five and adult mortality) and population growth on the population ageing in a pooled sample of nine lower and upper middle European countries. Therefore, the main goal of this research is to investigate the ageing process of the population in the context of mortality mechanisms (under five and adult mortality) and of population growth in nine European LUMIs. The analysis is implemented in terms of Pooled least squares with cross-section fixed effects methodology. The novelty used within this research is White two-way cluster standard errors & covariance. This study is based on a database from the World Bank and UN covering the period 1995-2019. The expected results are making available quantitative analysis and insights in the context of mechanisms between the ageing process of population, mortality and population growth across these European LUMIs. Results are consistent with the notion that the increasing ageing process within these countries may be a consequence of the negative impact of population growth and from the influence of adult mortality for both sexes. The research results confirm the presence of solid ties of the mechanism between mortality, population growth and population ageing. Therefore, a clear point was provided that mortality acceleration will depend primarily on the level of population growth."
https://openalex.org/W3211105423,"This paper uses publicly available data and various statistical models to estimate the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) and other disease parameters for Ghana’s early COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. We also test the effectiveness of government imposition of public health measures to reduce the risk of transmission and impact of the pandemic, especially in the early phase. R 0 is estimated from the statistical model as 3.21 using a 0.147 estimated growth rate [95% C.I.: 0.137–0.157] and a 15-day time to recovery after COVID-19 infection. This estimate of the initial R 0 is consistent with others reported in the literature from other parts of Africa, China and Europe. Our results also indicate that COVID-19 transmission reduced consistently in Ghana after the imposition of public health interventions—such as border restrictions, intra-city movement, quarantine and isolation—during the first phase of the pandemic from March to May 2020. However, the time-dependent reproduction number (R t ) beyond mid-May 2020 does not represent the true situation, given that there was not a consistent testing regime in place. This is also confirmed by our Jack-knife bootstrap estimates which show that the positivity rate over-estimates the true incidence rate from mid-May 2020. Given concerns about virus mutations, delays in vaccination and a possible new wave of the pandemic, there is a need for systematic testing of a representative sample of the population to monitor the reproduction number. There is also an urgent need to increase the availability of testing for the general population to enable early detection, isolation and treatment of infected individuals to reduce progression to severe disease and mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3208737158,"Electrical impedance myography (EIM) using surface techniques has shown promise as a means of diagnosing and tracking disorders affecting muscle and assessing treatment efficacy. However, the relationship between such surface-obtained impedance values and pure muscle impedance values has not been established. Here we studied three groups of diseased and wild-type (WT) animals, including a Duchenne muscular dystrophy model (the D2-mdx mouse), an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) model (the SOD1 G93A mouse), and a model of fat-related atrophy (the db/db diabetic obese mouse), performing hind limb measurements using a standard surface array and ex vivo measurements on freshly excised gastrocnemius muscle. A total of 101 animals (23 D2-mdx, 43 ALS mice, 12 db/db mice, and corresponding 30 WT mice) were studied with EIM across a frequency range of 8 kHz to 1 MHz. For both D2-mdx and ALS models, moderate strength correlations (Spearman rho values generally ranging from 0.3-0.7, depending on the impedance parameter (i.e., resistance, reactance and phase) were obtained. In these groups of animals, there was an offset in frequency with impedance values obtained at higher surface frequencies correlating more strongly to impedance values obtained at lower ex vivo frequencies. For the db/db model, correlations were comparatively weaker and strongest at very high and very low frequencies. When combining impedance data from all three disease models together, moderate correlations persisted (with maximal Spearman rho values of 0.45). These data support that surface EIM data reflect ex vivo muscle tissue EIM values to a moderate degree across several different diseases, with the highest correlations occurring in the 10-200 kHz frequency range. Understanding these relationships will prove useful for future applications of the technique of EIM in the assessment of neuromuscular disorders."

More recently, some studies also noted young smokers were more likely to get infected with COVID-19 compared to non-smokers. This study aims to assess the factors that influence smoking uptake among young students in Samoa. Findings from this study will provide valuable insight to policymakers and health authorities on policies and strategies to combat smoking among youth in Samoa and the Pacific Island Countries (PICs).The 2017 Global Youth Tobacco Survey data of Samoa, available from the World Health Organization is used in the analysis. We use the multinominal logistic model to investigate the effects of socio-economic and demographics factors on young students' uptake of smoking in Samoa.The main findings of this study indicate that sex, age, friendship, parental smoking, family discussion, outside influence, pocket money, and mother's education are important determinants of tobacco smoking initiation among youths in Samoa.Our findings contribute towards the evidence of the imperative health impact of friends, parents, and public smoking on students in Samoa. This warrants strategies that are effective in discouraging parents from smoking and implement measures that prevent smoking in public places. Moreover, educational efforts, particularly those that encourage more discussion at home settings on the harmful effects of smoking are strongly recommended. Parents are strongly encouraged to regularly monitor children's spending behaviour."

A clinical dose finding study is not known for any of the currently marketed products. The aim of the present preclinical trial was to investigate a novel DCB coated with 6 μg Ptx/mm2 in a porcine model.The current study investigated a DCB with a novel, modified iopromide based matrix with 6 μg Ptx/mm2. Drug transfer to the vessel wall of peripheral arteries was compared with a dose of 3 μg Ptx/mm2 and two fully overlapping DCB with 3 μg Ptx/mm2, each. Ptx concentration in the vessel wall after drug transfer was about twice as high for balloons with 6 μg/mm2 (1957±1472 μg/g) and two overlapping DCB with 3 μg Ptx/mm2, each (1287±619 μg/g) compared to a single balloon with 3 μg Ptx/mm2, (787±738 μg/g), with statistical significant differences for 1x6 μg/mm2 vs. 1x3 μg/mm2 (p = 0.017) but not for 2x3 μg/mm2 vs. 1x3 μg/mm2 (p = 0.184) and 1x6 μg/mm2 vs. 2x3 μg/mm2 (p = 0.178). The proportion of residual Ptx on balloon after treatment was similar for all groups between 6±1% and 10±3% of dose on balloon.The dose of 6 μg Ptx/mm2 was successfully as well as reproducibly coated on conventional balloon catheters. Increased Ptx on balloons resulted in increased drug concentration in the vessel wall. A single balloon with 6 μg Ptx/mm2 seems to provide double dose compared to 3 μg Ptx/mm2, facilitates the procedure, and may reduce medico-economic cost compared to the use of two standard DCB."
https://openalex.org/W3209993756,"In self-reports, socially desirable responding threatens the validity of prevalence estimates for sensitive personal attitudes and behaviors. Indirect questioning techniques such as the crosswise model attempt to control for the influence of social desirability bias. The crosswise model has repeatedly been found to provide more valid prevalence estimates than direct questions. We investigated whether crosswise model estimates are also less susceptible to deliberate faking than direct questions. To this end, we investigated the effect of “fake good” instructions on responses to direct and crosswise model questions. In a sample of 1,946 university students, 12-month prevalence estimates for a sensitive road traffic behavior were higher and thus presumably more valid in the crosswise model than in a direct question. Moreover, “fake good” instructions severely impaired the validity of the direct questioning estimates, whereas the crosswise model estimates were unaffected by deliberate faking. Participants also reported higher levels of perceived confidentiality and a lower perceived ease of faking in the crosswise model compared to direct questions. Our results corroborate previous studies finding the crosswise model to be an effective tool for counteracting the detrimental effects of positive self-presentation in surveys on sensitive issues."

https://openalex.org/W3211237554,"Housemaids are the most vulnerable group to sexual violence due to their working condition, isolation and school arrangements. Despite the ubiquity of sexual violence among the domestic work sector, particularly among housemaids, this area of research continues to be neglected. This study was aimed at examining the prevalence and factors pertaining to sexual violence among housemaids attending night school program in urban setups of Gedeo zone, Southern Ethiopia.A school based quantitative cross sectional study was conducted among 394 housemaids attending night schools in the urban setups of Gedeo Zone from April to May 2019. After stratifying of students using class grade, SRS technique was used to choose study subjects from each stratum. Quantitative data was collected using face to face interview and qualitative was collected using focus group discussion, in-depth interview and key informant interview. The data was entered and analyzed by SPSS version 20. Binary logistic regression was fitted to determine the association of each independent variable with the dependent variable.Based on the finding, the prevalence of sexual violence was 60.2%. The odds of experiencing sexual violence through working life-time as housemaid was higher for those who had migrated from rural to urban for work [AOR = 1.97: 95% CI, (1.07,3.63)], had less than 5 years of experience as housemaid [AOR = 3.10: 95% CI, (1.60, 6.00)], were in the age group of 15-19 [AOR = 3.75:95% CI (1.88, 7.46), ever used alcohol [AOR = 6.77: 95% CI, (2.65,17.33)] and whose fathers lacked formal education [AOR = 2.75:95%CI (1.24,6.08)]. On the other hand, unmarried /housemaids having no regular sexual partner were less likely to face sexual violence [AOR. = 0.28: 95% CI, (0.13, 0.57)].The level of sexual violence was found to be high among housemaids attending night schools in in this study. Housemaids from rural area, those newly starting the work, younger housemaids, and those who were married were more likely to be victims of sexual violence."
https://openalex.org/W3208993462,"When pharmaceutical interventions are unavailable to deal with an epidemic outbreak, adequate management of communication strategies can be key to reduce the contagion risks. On the one hand, accessibility to trustworthy and timely information, whilst on the other, the adoption of preventive behaviors may be both crucial. However, despite the abundance of communication strategies, their effectiveness has been scarcely evaluated or merely circumscribed to the scrutiny of public affairs. To study the influence of communication strategies on the spreading dynamics of an infectious disease, we implemented a susceptible-exposed-infected-removed-dead (SEIRD) epidemiological model, using an agent-based approach. Agents in our systems can obtain information modulating their behavior from two sources: (i) through the local interaction with other neighboring agents and, (ii) from a central entity delivering information with a certain periodicity. In doing so, we highlight how global information delivered from a central entity can reduce the impact of an infectious disease and how informing even a small fraction of the population has a remarkable impact, when compared to not informing the population at all. Moreover, having a scheme of delivering daily messages makes a stark difference on the reduction of cases, compared to the other evaluated strategies, denoting that daily delivery of information produces the largest decrease in the number of cases. Furthermore, when the information spreading relies only on local interactions between agents, and no central entity takes actions along the dynamics, then the epidemic spreading is virtually independent of the initial amount of informed agents. On top of that, we found that local communication plays an important role in an intermediate regime where information coming from a central entity is scarce. As a whole, our results highlight the importance of proper communication strategies, both accurate and daily, to tackle epidemic outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W3209003667,"Cultivated cotton, such as Gossypium hirsutum L., produces extrafloral (EF) nectar on leaves (foliar) and reproductive structures (bracteal) as an indirect anti-herbivore defense. In exchange for this carbohydrate-rich substance, predatory insects such as ants protect the plant against herbivorous insects. Some EF nectar-bearing plants respond to herbivory by increasing EF nectar production. For instance, herbivore-free G. hirsutum produces more bracteal than foliar EF nectar, but increases its foliar EF nectar production in response to herbivory. This study is the first to test for systemically induced changes to the carbohydrate composition of bracteal EF nectar in response to foliar herbivory on G. hirsutum. We found that foliar herbivory significantly increased the sucrose content of bracteal EF nectar while glucose and fructose remained unchanged. Sucrose content is known to influence ant foraging behavior and previous studies of an herbivore-induced increase to EF nectar caloric content found that it led to increased ant activity on the plant. As a follow-up to our finding, ant recruitment to mock EF nectar solutions that varied in sucrose content was tested in the field. The ants did not exhibit any preference for either solution, potentially because sucrose is a minor carbohydrate component in G. hirsutum EF nectar: total sugar content was not significantly affected by the increase in sucrose. Nonetheless, our findings raise new questions about cotton's inducible EF nectar responses to herbivory. Further research is needed to determine whether an herbivore-induced increase in sucrose content is typical of Gossypium spp., and whether it constitutes a corollary of systemic sucrose induction, or a potentially adaptive mechanism which enhances ant attraction to the plant."
https://openalex.org/W3209463905,"In a previous study, we developed a Multi-Locus VNTRs Analysis (MLVA) typing system, called MLVA-5, for the discrimination of Chlamydia trachomatis genovar E strain. The results suggested the clonal spread of a MLVA-5 type 21 strain among men who have sex with men (MSM). We applied the MLVA-5 typing method on 157 French anorectal genovar E specimens and 19 Swedish specimens collected between 2010 and 2015. A total of 29 MLVA-5 types was obtained, with three predominant types among French samples: 78 specimens belonged to MLVA-5 type 21, two other types, 11 and 13, included 9 and 14 specimens, respectively. In 15 cases, one unique MLVA-5 type was observed for a single patient, 7 of which were new types not previously described. The distribution of MLVA-5 types according to sexual orientation showed that the 7 anorectal specimens from heterosexual patients belonged to 6 genotypes, and the 12 anorectal specimens from bisexual patients comprised eight types. The 95 anorectal specimens from MSM were distributed into 22 types, but 55 (57.9%) of them belonged to MLVA-5 type 21. Among the Swedish specimens from MSM, eight were from MLVA-type 21 (4 urines and 4 anorectal specimens). The results support the hypothesis of the spread of clonal genovar E strain among MSM."

https://openalex.org/W3209854407,"We investigated the characteristics of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the soft tissue of two frozen baby woolly mammoths ( Mammuthus primigenius ) that died and were buried in Siberian permafrost approximately 40,000 years ago. Morphological and biochemical analyses of mammoth lung and liver demonstrated that those soft tissues were preserved at the gross anatomical and histological levels. The ultrastructure of ECM components, namely a fibrillar structure with a collagen-characteristic pattern of cross-striation, was clearly visible with transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Type I and type IV collagens were detected by immunohistochemical observation. Quantitative amino acid analysis of liver and lung tissues of the baby mammoths indicated that collagenous protein is selectively preserved in these tissues as a main protein. Type I and type III collagens were detected as major components by means of liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis after digestion with trypsin. These results indicate that the triple helical collagen molecule, which is resistant to proteinase digestion, has been preserved in the soft tissues of these frozen mammoths for 40,000 years."

https://openalex.org/W3209107255,"The annual assessment of Family Planning (FP) indicators, such as the modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR), is a key component of monitoring and evaluating goals of global FP programs and initiatives. To that end, the Family Planning Estimation Model (FPEM) was developed with the aim of producing survey-informed estimates and projections of mCPR and other key FP indictors over time. With large-scale surveys being carried out on average every 3-5 years, data gaps since the most recent survey often exceed one year. As a result, survey-based estimates for the current year from FPEM are often based on projections that carry a larger uncertainty than data informed estimates. In order to bridge recent data gaps we consider the use of a measure, termed Estimated Modern Use (EMU), which has been derived from routinely collected family planning service statistics. However, EMU data come with known limitations, namely measurement errors which result in biases and additional variation with respect to survey-based estimates of mCPR. Here we present a data model for the incorporation of EMU data into FPEM, which accounts for these limitations. Based on known biases, we assume that only changes in EMU can inform FPEM estimates, while also taking inherent variation into account. The addition of this EMU data model to FPEM allows us to provide a secondary data source for informing and reducing uncertainty in current estimates of mCPR. We present model validations using a survey-only model as a baseline comparison and we illustrate the impact of including the EMU data model in FPEM. Results show that the inclusion of EMU data can change point-estimates of mCPR by up to 6.7 percentage points compared to using surveys only. Observed reductions in uncertainty were modest, with the width of uncertainty intervals being reduced by up to 2.7 percentage points."

https://openalex.org/W3210068172,"Patterns of local adaptation can emerge in response to the selective pressures diseases exert on host populations as reflected in increased frequencies of respective, advantageous genotypes. Elucidating patterns of local adaptation enhance our understanding of mechanisms of disease spread and the capacity for species to adapt in context of rapidly changing environments such as the Arctic. Arctic rabies is a lethal disease that largely persists in northern climates and overlaps with the distribution of its natural host, arctic fox. Arctic fox populations display little neutral genetic structure across their North American range, whereas phylogenetically unique arctic rabies variants are restricted in their geographic distributions. It remains unknown if arctic rabies variants impose differential selection upon host populations, nor what role different rabies variants play in the maintenance and spread of this disease. Using a targeted, genotyping-by-sequencing assay, we assessed correlations of arctic fox immunogenetic variation with arctic rabies variants to gain further insight into the epidemiology of this disease. Corroborating past research, we found no neutral genetic structure between sampled regions, but did find moderate immunogenetic structuring between foxes predominated by different arctic rabies variants. FST outliers associated with host immunogenetic structure included SNPs within interleukin and Toll-like receptor coding regions (IL12B, IL5, TLR3 and NFKB1); genes known to mediate host responses to rabies. While these data do not necessarily reflect causation, nor a direct link to arctic rabies, the contrasting genetic structure of immunologically associated candidate genes with neutral loci is suggestive of differential selection and patterns of local adaptation in this system. These data are somewhat unexpected given the long-lived nature and dispersal capacities of arctic fox; traits expected to undermine local adaptation. Overall, these data contribute to our understanding of the co-evolutionary relationships between arctic rabies and their primary host and provide data relevant to the management of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W3210313518,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is highly prevalent worldwide. In the United States, estimates show that more than 30% of the adult population has MetS. MetS consists of multiple phenotypes, including obesity, dyslipidemia, and impaired glucose tolerance. Therefore, identifying the molecular mechanisms to explain this complex disease is critical for diagnosing and treating MetS. We previously showed 70 increased genes and 20 decreased genes in whole blood in MetS participants. The present study aimed to identify blood-based DNA methylation biomarkers in non-MetS versus MetS participants. The present study analyzed whole blood DNA samples from 184 adult participants of Latino descent from the Arizona Insulin Resistance (AIR) registry. We used the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP: ATP III) criteria to identify non-MetS (n = 110) and MetS (n = 74) participants. We performed whole blood methylation analysis on select genes: ATP Synthase, H+ Transporting mitochondrial F1 Complex, Epsilon Subunit (ATP5E), Cytochrome C Oxidase Subunit VIc (COX6C), and Ribosomal Protein L9 (RPL9). The pyrosequencing analysis was a targeted approach focusing on the promoter region of each gene that specifically captured CpG methylation sites. In MetS participants, we showed decreased methylation in two CpG sites in COX6C and three CpG sites in RPL9, all p < 0.05 using the Mann-Whitney U test. There were no ATP5E CpG sites differently methylated in the MetS participants. Furthermore, while adjusting for age, gender, and smoking status, logistic regression analysis reaffirmed the associations between MetS and mean methylation within COX6C and RPL9 (both p < 0.05). In addition, Spearman's correlation revealed a significant inverse relationship between the previously published gene expression data and methylation data for RPL9 (p < 0.05). In summary, these results highlight potential blood DNA methylation biomarkers for the MetS phenotype. However, future validation studies are warranted to strengthen our findings."

https://openalex.org/W3210940641,"Sign Language (SL) is a continuous and complex stream of multiple body movement features. That raises the challenging issue of providing efficient computational models for the description and analysis of these movements. In the present paper, we used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to decompose SL motion into elementary movements called principal movements (PMs). PCA was applied to the upper-body motion capture data of six different signers freely producing discourses in French Sign Language. Common PMs were extracted from the whole dataset containing all signers, while individual PMs were extracted separately from the data of individual signers. This study provides three main findings: (1) although the data were not synchronized in time across signers and discourses, the first eight common PMs contained 94.6% of the variance of the movements; (2) the number of PMs that represented 94.6% of the variance was nearly the same for individual as for common PMs; (3) the PM subspaces were highly similar across signers. These results suggest that upper-body motion in unconstrained continuous SL discourses can be described through the dynamic combination of a reduced number of elementary movements. This opens up promising perspectives toward providing efficient automatic SL processing tools based on heavy mocap datasets, in particular for automatic recognition and generation."
