https://openalex.org/W2113357723,"Peanut agglutinin was purified by affinity chromatography on Sepharose-epsilon-aminocaproyl-beta-D-galactopyranosylamine. The purified lectin obtained in a yield of 150 mg/100 g of defatted peanut was homogeneous on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ultracentrifugation, and gel filtration. This intrinsic sedimentation coefficient (So20,w) and the intrinsic diffusion coefficient (Do20,w) were estimated at pH 7.4 as 5.7 +/- 0.1 S and 5.0 X 10(-7) cm2s(-1), respectively. The molecular weight of the agglutinin, determined by sedimentation and diffusion and by gel filtration, was found to be 110,000. Disc gel electrophoresis and gel filtration, both in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, gave a single component of Mr = 27,500 suggesting that the lectin is a tetramer composed of four subunits. Four alanine residues per 110,000 g were found by NH2-terminal analysis and the sequence of the five NH2-terminal amino acids was: ALa-Glu-Ser-Val-Thr. Each cycle in a sequenator gave a single amino acid, suggesting that the four subunits are identical. Peanut agglutinin does not contain covalently bound sugar; it is devoid of cysteine and cystine, low in methionine, histidine, and tryptophan, but rich in acidic and hydroxyamino acids. The lectin agglutinated erthrocytes of human ABO blood types equally well, but only after they have been treated with neuraminidase. Of the monosaccharides tested for inhibition of hemagglutination only D-galactose and alpha- and beta-D-galactosides were active. High inhibitory activity was found with the Discaccharide DGalbeta(1 in equilibrium 3)DGalNAc and with the disialylated glycoproteins: alpha1-acid glycoprotein, fetuin, glycophorin, and human blood group NN or MM antigen. These desialylated glycoproteins also reacted with the lectin to form precipitin bands in Ouchterlony double diffusion in agar."

https://openalex.org/W2025484693,"In 57 species of anthropoids relative size of incisors in highly correlated with diet. Anthropoids that feed primarily on large food objects (large fruits) have larger incisors than those that feed on smaller food objects (berries or leaves). This difference reflects a need for more extensive incisal preparation of larger food objects before mastication. Extensive incisal preparation causes increased tooth wear, therefore, enlarged incisors are probably an adaptive response to increase their wear potential."

This alteration consists of an ordered aggression of intramembranous particles, and appears to be of functional significance, since the frequency of aggregation sites per area of membrane is closely correlated with vasopressin-induced osmotic water flow."
https://openalex.org/W1586968646,"The microsomal fraction of sheep vesicular glands has been found to oxygenate 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran, luminol, and the carcinogenic hydrocarbon benzopyrene when incubated with arachidonic acid. The oxygenations demonstrate an absolute dependence on enzyme and fatty acid and can be completely inhibited by indomethacin and 2,3-dimercaproptopanol, inhibitors of prostaglandin synthetase. The oxygenations can also be stimulated by the hydroperoxy endoperoxide, prostaglandin G2, and 15-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid. These latter reactions are not inhibited by indomethacin or dimercaptopropanol but do require the microsomal enzyme system. The involvement of superoxide anion in the transformations could not be demonstrated. The oxygenations occurring in the presence of arachidonic acid appear to arise via the interaction of a microsomal enzyme system with hydroperoxide intermediates of prostaglandin biosynthesis. The ability of various sulfur reagents (reduced glutathione, alpha-lipoic acid, methional) to inhibit co-oxygenation is probably related to their ability to stimulate the conversion of the intermediate to prostaglandins."

https://openalex.org/W1966655184,"In a capillary assay, uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation and inhibitors of electron transport are repellents for Bacillus subtilis. They also cause transient tumbling in naturally smooth swimming strains. Tumbling strains can be made to swim smoothly by addition of attractant and then immediately returned to tumbling by subsequent addition of repellent. Arsenate does not cause transient tumbling, suggesting that decrease in concentration of adenosine triphosphate does not cause tumbling and that adenosine triphosphate concentration does not govern tumbling frequency. Instead, the evidence suggests that diminution of the energized state of the membrane, or membrane potential, causes tumbling although the level of the energized state itself does not govern tumbling frequency."
https://openalex.org/W2010748122,"The synthesis and stability of low molecular weight RNAs following heat shock in Drosophila melanogaster cell cultures have been examined. When cultures are raised from 25°C to 37°C, the synthesis of tRNA and at least two other low molecular weight RNAs continues at the 25°C rate. 5.8S ribosomal RNA and most of the low molecular weight nuclear RNAs are not synthesized. The synthesis of 5S ribosomal RNA is greatly reduced. A large amount of an RNA of about 135 nucleotides in length accumulates at 37°C. Nucleotide sequence analysis reveals that this RNA is a novel form of 5S RNA with approximately 15 additional nucleotides at its 3′ end."
https://openalex.org/W1488274883,"The identity and stoichiometry of the reaction products of the oxygenated reduced flavin bacterial luciferase intermediate isolated by Sephadex chromatography at low temperature have been determined under two conditions, allowing the reaction to go to completion by warming either in the presence or absence of long chain aliphatic aldehyde. In the latter case, very little bioluminescence occurs, and 1 mol each of H2O2 and FMN is produced per mol of enzyme intermediate. In the presence of aldehyde, the formation of an aldehyde-enzyme intermediate complex can be detected by optical absorption spectroscopy at -30 degrees; upon warming, bioluminescence with high quantum yield occurs with the formation of 1 mol of FMN but no H2O2."

https://openalex.org/W1560285331,"Vitamin A in human plasma is transported by its specific carrier protein, the retinol-binding protein. Under physiological conditions the protein forms a stable protein-protein complex with the tetrameric plasma protein, the thyroxine-binding prealbumin. Human prealbumin was shown to interact with the fluorescent probes 1,8-anilinonaphthalene sulfonate (ANS) and 2-p-toluidinylnaphthalene-6-sulfonate (TNS). ANS bound to the protein at two independent sites with the apparent association constant 3 X 10(5) M-1, whereas TNS interacted with a single site with the binding constant 5 X 10(k) M-1. The fluorescent yield of protein-bound ANS was 0.95, a more than 200-fold enhancement compared with that of ANS in aqueous solutions. TNS enhanced its quantum yield nearly 500-fold to 0.37. On addition of thyroid hormones the fluorescent probes could be quantitatively displaced from the protein. This finding suggested that triiodthyronine, thyroxine, and the probes bound to a common site in prealbumin, which is likely to have a strongly hydrophobic character. The association constants for the interaction between prealbumin and the thyroid hormones could be calculated by using the hormones as competitive inhibitors in the TNS-prealbumin titrations. The data from the competition experiments together with those obtained from equilibrium dialysis revealed one major hormone binding site on the protein. The calculated association constant were 9 X 10(6) M-1 and 1 X 10(8) M-1 for triiodothyronine and thyroxine, respectively. Prealbumin monomers were bound to Sepharose by covalent attachment, and their properties were examined. Evidence was obtained demonstrating that the retinol-binding protein could interact with a single subunit of prealbumin. The estimated apparent association constant for the interaction of the protein and the matrix-bound monomeric prealbumin was 3 X 10(4) M-1, approximately 250-fold lower than that measured for protein and matrix-bound tetrameric prealbumin. The data, however, strongly suggest that there are four retinol-binding protein sites per prealbumin molecule. Using the technique of sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation the prealbumin subunit self-association has been studied. The energy of the interaction for the prealbumin subunits is very high, and various concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride has to be used to perturb the equilibrium. All experiments indicated that prealbumin dissociates directly into monomers without the presence of intermediate forms. Thyroxine perturbed the chemical equilibrium of the prealbumin monomer-tetramer system by strengthening the interaction between the subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1531768017,"Antibody directed against rho factor from vegetative Bacillus subtilis was prepared by immunizing a rabbit with denaturated rho polypeptide isolated by electrophoresis of partially purified DNA-dependent RNA polymerase on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide slab gel. Antiserum to rho reacted specifically with native rho polypeptide but not with core RNA polymerase as judged by complement fixation and by an immunodiffusion assay. Anti-rho antibody also inhibited the ability of rho to stimulate transcription of phage phie DNA but failed to inhibit transcription of poly(dA-dT) by core enzyme. Specific antibody was also raised against a mixture of the beta and beta' subunits of RNA polymerase purified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The effect of the anti-rho gamma-globulin on the transcription of phage phie DNA by RNA polymerase in crude extracts of vegetative and sporulating cells was examined. Anti-rho antibody markedly inhibited the transcription of phage DNA by RNA polymerase partially purified from vegetative bacteria by ammonium sulfate fractionation but had little effect on transcription of the phage DNA template by enzyme from sporulating cells. Addition of purified rho to a vegetative extract that had been depleted of rho by treatment with the anti-rho antibody restored active transcription of phage DNA. However, addition of purified rho to an antibody-treated extract of sporulating cells had little effect on phie RNA synthesis. These findings suggest that sporulating cells contain a component that interferes with the activity of the rho subunit of RNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1558549337,"In a previous communication (J. Biol. Chem. (1975) 250, 1676-1682), methods were described for the purification of the N-acetylmuramic acid L-alanine amidase from Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6051 and of a modifier protein which combines stoichiometrically with the enzyme and stimulates the activity approximately 3-fold. A detailed examination of the wall cleavage products obtained in the absence and in the presence of modifier indicates that the major effect of the modifier is not to change the enzyme velocity, but rather to change the pattern of cleavage from a more random pattern, when enzyme alone hydrolyzes the cell wall, to a sequential pattern in the presence of modifier protein. Tight binding of the enzyme to the cell wall and functional interaction with the modifier occur only when cell walls from Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6051 containing or teichoic acid are used as a substrate. We suggest that a general function of cell wall teichoic acids is to act as specific allosteric ligands for bacterial cell wall lytic enzymes as has been demonstrated previously in Pneumococci (Tomasz, A., and Westphal, M (1971) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 68, 2627-2630)."

https://openalex.org/W1556025841,"Of the 15 to 20% of total spore protein which is degraded during germination of spores of Bacillus megaterium, greater than 80% is derived from a protein fraction soluble in dilute acids such as acetic acid that contains two major proteins, termed A and B. These two proteins are low or absent in germinated spores, log phase cells, and early stationary phase cells, but both are synthesized and appear in parallel late in sporulation after the appearance of nonrefractile forespores but before the appearance of refractile spores. These proteins accumulate during the time that the developing spore becomes resistant to ultraviolet light but well before acquisition of heat resistance. Both proteins are located in the core of the dormant spore, but analysis of ruptured spores has revealed no binding of protein A or B to ribosomes, membranes, or DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1572291742,"Two major proteins, termed proteins A and B, and one minor species, termed protein C, have been purified to homogeneity from dilute acid extracts of dormant spores of Bacillus megaterium. These three species comprise approximately 80% of the protein in the dilute acid extracts and account for 60 to 75% of the protein degraded during spore germination. All three proteins have low molecular weights (7,000 to 10,000), high isoelectric points (greater than 9.8), alanine as the NH2-terminal amino acid, are more hydrophilic than most proteins, and all lack cysteine, cystine, and tryptophan. In addition all three proteins are extremely sensitive to a wide variety of proteolytic enzymes, much more so than average proteins such as serum albumin, lysozyme, and hemoglobin. These proteins also bind to both purified DNA and to a nuclear body from dormant spores. Although this binding gives little or no protection to proteins A and B from proteolysis, it does result in elevation of the melting temperature of the DNA by as much as 20degrees."
https://openalex.org/W1608772596,"Extracts of Bacillus subtilis contain a deoxyuridinetriphosphatase (dUTPase) activity with a molecular weight of approximately 48,000. The enzyme is maximally active at pH 8.5, being stimulated by Mg2+ and inhibited by EDTA. The enzyme is specific for dUTP among all the natural nucleotides tested, with an apparent Km for dUTP of 2 muM. Bacteriophage PBS2, whose DNA contains uracil instead of thymine, induces upon infection of B. subtilis a new 83,000-dalton protein which inhibits the host's dUTPase. The inhibitor acts immediately and reversibly in vitro to inhibit dUMP production from dUTP. The inhibitor's action is maximal in dUTPase assays performed at pH 6 to 7, and is minimal at pH 9.7. The inhibitor seems to form a higher molecular weight complex with the B. subtilis dUTPase. Increasing the pH of the medium for PBS2 infection from pH 7 to pH 8.85 caused a dramatic decrease in the synthesis of phage DNA and progeny phage. The newly synthesized DNA had an altered thymine/uracil ratio, being increased from less than 0.03 to greater than 1.0. We propose that infection at high pH prevents the PBS2-induced dUTPase inhibitor from blocking the B. subtilis dUTPase activity, thereby allowing the degradation of dUTP and the synthesis of dTTP (both of which are DNA polymerase substrates), so that thymine replaces some of the uracil normally found in PBS2 DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2124701454,"Ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase determined by bacteriophage T4 consists of a tight complex (alpha2beta2) of the polypeptide chains alpha (Mr = 80,000 to 85,000) and beta (Mr = 35,000). The alpha2 dimer (= protein B1) was purified from Escherichia coli B infected with T4 mutant nrdB55 (Yeh, Y.C., and Tessman, I. (1972) Virology 47, 767-772) which carries an amber mutation in the gene coding for the beta polypeptide chain. Protein B1 contained binding sites for dATP, an allosteric effector of the reductase. The beta2 dimer (= protein B2) was purified by selective desorption with 1 M guanidine HCl from a dATP-Sepharose affinity column containing adsorbed native T4 ribonucleotide reductase. Protein B2, isolated this way, was enzymatically inactive due to partial loss of its iron but it could be reactivated by treatment with ferrous iron. Active protein B2 contained two atoms of non-heme iron per molecule and exhibited the optical and electron spin resonance spectra previously demonstrated in the native enzyme. The T4-induced proteins B1 and B2 were unable to reduce ribonucleotides when assayed separately but were active in combination. The proteins did not form catalytically functional hybrids with proteins B1 and B2 of Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase, neither did they cross-react immunologically with the latter. 5-Hydroxymethyl-dCTP, at concentrations above 10 muM, was a positive allosteric effector of T4 ribonucleotide reductase promoting the reduction of the pyrimidine ribonucleotides CDP and UDP. The nucleotide had little effect on E. coli ribonucleotide reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1581496645,"Tetanus toxin has been isolated from the extract of Clostridium tetani and analyzed for purity using various methods, e.g. sedimentation velocity, gel filtration, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis, and immunodiffusion. The homogeneous toxin, characterized by a minimum lethal dose of 10 pg (18- to 20-g mouse), was judged to be of high purity. The amino acid composition was determined and found to be in good agreement with reported values for both filtrate and extract toxin. The corrected sedimentation coefficient, so20,w, was found to be 7.5, and the molecular weight was estimated to be 150,000. These values agree closely with those reported by others. The toxin was modified using the conventional formaldehyde reaction to produce toxoid and both reductive methylation and carbamylation, which are highly specific for lysyl residues. Under certain reaction conditions, carbamylation of the toxin completely eliminated toxicity. Whereas reductive methylation yielded a high degree of conversion of lysine to dimethyllysine and monomethyllysine, the toxicity, albeit greatly reduced, was never completely eliminated. The circular dichroic spectrum of each chemically modified toxin was obtained, resolved into Gaussian components, and compared with that of native toxin, which is estimated to contain about 20% alpha helix and 23% beta structure. The far ultraviolet circular dichroic spectra of toxin and toxoid were characterized by negative extrema at 208 nm and 217 nm attributable to ordered secondary structure, and toxin also exhibited a distinct shoulder at 223 nm. Carbamylated toxin and methylated toxin were characterized by negative extrema at 210 nm and 206 nm, respectively, and both exhibited shoulders at 216 to 217 nm and 223 nm. The toxin and derivatives exhibited multiple negative extrema above 250 nm which were assigned to the various aromatic residues. There were differences in the spectra of the toxin and derivatives over the entire wavelength region, thus suggesting changes in the local environment of various chromophores. In particular, the rotational strengths of many of the bands assigned to tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine were altered in the derivatives. Also, in the far ultraviolet region of the circular dichroic spectrum, the data were suggestive of some reduction in the amount of both alpha helix and beta structure in the derivatives. However, there was no evidence of extensive conformational changes, e.g. unfolding, in the modified toxins. Presently, it is not known if the small conformational differences between toxin and toxoid are important in the loss of toxicity with the retention of immunogenicity in the derivative. The modification data are consistent with the hypothesis that separate amino acid residues are involved in toxicity and immunogenicity."

https://openalex.org/W1480791899,"The present investigation has aimed at defining the factor responsible for the differences in microsomal metabolism of steroids between germ-free and conventional rats. Cholesterol, cholic acid, taurocholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid were fed to conventional and germ-free male rats and the effects on liver microsomal metabolism of 4-[4-14C]androstene-3,17-dione, 5alpha-[4-14C]androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol, [4-14C]-cholesterol, 7alpha-hydroxy-4-[6beta-3H]cholesten-3-one, and [24-14C]lithocholic acid were studied. The most consistent effects were found with dietary cholesterol that stimulated the activities of several of the hydroxylases active on 4-androstene-3,17-dione and 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol and that decreased the 5alpha reduction of 4-androstene-3,17-dione, increased the 7alpha hydroxylation of cholesterol, decreased the 12alpha hydroxylation of 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, and increased by 6beta hydroxylation of lithocholic acid. These effects of cholesterol feeding on the microsomal metabolism of steroids in conventional rats made the pattern of microsomal enzyme activities resemble that characteristic of germ-free rats. Cholesterol feeding led to a pronounced increase in the intestinal concentration of beta-muricholic acid in conventional rats. Furthermore, cholesterol feeding to conventional animals led to an intestinal ratio of chenodeoxycholic acid (including its metabolites alpha- and beta-muricholic acid and hyodeoxycholic acid) to cholic acid (including deoxycholic acid) that was almost identical to that in germ-free rats. Conventionalization of germ-free rats for a period of up to 56 days led only to a partial normalization of the liver microsomal metabolism of 5alpha-[4-14C]androstane-3alpha, 17beta-diol and 7alpha-hydroxy-4-[6beta-3H]cholesten-3-one and of the liver microsomal concentration of cytochrome P-450. The concentration of cholesterol was higher in both total liver homogenate and liver microsomal fraction of germ-free rats than in corresponding preparations from conventional rats. In conclusion, it is suggested that cholesterol is one of the factors responsible for the different microsomal metabolism of steroids in germ-free and conventional rats. It is also suggested that cholesterol may play a role as regulator of microsomal enzyme activities."
https://openalex.org/W1577208830,"Two enzymes, tryptophan transaminase and indolepyruvate C-methyltransferase, which are active in the initial steps of the biosynthetic pathway of the antibiotic indolmycin, have been detected and partially purified from cell-free extracts of Streptomyces griseus. The transaminase has been purified 3-fold by ammonium sulfate fractionation. At this stage of purification, it catalyzes the alpha-ketoglutarate and pyridoxal phosphate-dependent transamination of L-tryptophan, 3-methyltryptophan, L-pphenylalanine, and L-tyrosine. The C-methyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to position 3 of the aliphatic side chain of indolepyruvate. No cofactors are required. The C-methyltransferase has been purified 110-fold by ammonium sulfate fractionation, Sephadex G-150 gel filtration, DEAE-Sephadex column chromotography, and Bio-Gel A-5m gel filtration. The enzyme has a broad pH optimum of 7.5 to 8.5. A molecular weight of 55,000 +/- 5,000 has been determined by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration with reference proteins and a molecular weight of 58,000 +/- 8,000 has been determined by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The enzyme is relatively stable at temperatures of 0-5 degrees but is destroyed by freezing or by heating. The C-methyltransferase is inhibited strongly by the thiol reagents p-chloromercuribenzoate and N-ethylmaleimide. The Zn2+ and Fe2+ chelators 1,10-phenanthroline and 2,2'-bipyridine also inhibit the enzyme activity but EDTA does not. Michaelis-Menten constants have been determined for the 110-fold purified enzyme as 1.2 X 10(-5) M for S-adenosylmethionine and 4.8 X 10(-6) M for indolepyruvate. The enzyme activity in the crude extract is inhibited competitively by indolmycin (Ki equals 2.3 mM) and L-tryptophan (Ki equals 0.17 mM), but these effects are not observed after the enzyme has been passed through the Sephades G-150 column during purification. The crude extract is capable of methylating phenylpyruvate and p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate but this capability is lost upon purification of the indolepyruvate C-methyltransferase activity. No methylation of L-tryptophan occurs under the conditions used."
https://openalex.org/W2082347030,"32P-labeled light chain messenger RNA was prepared from mouse MOPC 21 myeloma cells. The messenger RNA was hybridized to purified repetitive nuclear DNA and both the hybridized (repetitive 32P-RNA) and nonhybridized (nonrepetitive 32P-RNA) fractions were isolated. Only the nonhybridized RNA gave a T1 ribonuclease fingerprint showing oligonucleotides derived from the variable and constant regions of the light chain messenger RNA. In addition, this fingerprint showed oligonucleotides derived from the untranslated regions of the light chain messenger RNA. The nonrepetitive 32P-RNA was shown to rehybridize only with the unique fraction of total nuclear DNA. The rapidly hybridizing part of the unfractionated 32P-RNA preparation, therefore, is not a component of the light chain messenger RNA itself. Complementary DNA was prepared with reverse transcriptase using unlabeled light chain messenger RNA as template, and the transcripts were fractionated into various size classes. Complementary DNA molecules greater than 900 bases in length hybridized with both the initial messenger RNA and with the nonrepetitive 32P-RNA but failed to hybridize with excess purified repetitive 32P-RNA. The rapidly hybridizing component of the messenger RNA fraction, therefore, does not appear to be transcribed by reverse transcriptase. It is concluded that, under the experimental conditions used, the light chain messenger RNA hybridizes exclusively with unique DNA."

A mixture of the two antisera caused spur formation of the two precipitin lines obtained with the pure enzymes. Antiserum to L-apoprotein reacted with native L-enzyme and L-apoprotein but not with the D-sspecific enzyme. D-6-hydroxynicotine oxidase activity was inhibited by the anti-D-antiserum, leaving the L-enzyme fully active, while anti-L-antiserum inhibited the L- but not the D-specific activity. The delayed induction of D-6-hydroxynicotine oxidase as compared to the other activities of the nicotine-degrading sequence and the differential immunochemical behavior of the enantiozymes allowed the search for a D-enzyme precursor. In cells harvested 3 hours after the addition of DL-nicotine, the L-enzyme activity was present, whereas no D-enzyme activity could be detected. However, an extract of these cells did form an immunoprecipitin line with anti-D-antiserum. L-6-Hydroxynicotine oxidase, but no D-6-hydroxynicotine oxidase activity, could also be induced in Arthrobacter oxidans grown in a medium with a high glucose content and DL-nicotine as the sole nitrogen source. An extract of these L-induced cells produced the specific immunoprecipitation with anti-D-antiserum. A pulse-chase experiment with cells grown first on glucose and DL-nicotine in the presence of [14C]leucine and then in an unlabeled medium which induces D-6-hydroxynicotine oxidase activity resulted in a radioactive D-enzyme-immunoprecipitin line. From these experiments it is concluded that a precursor of the active D-enzyme is induced simultaneously with the other nicotine-degrading enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W80066933,"Reaction of alpha-lactalbumin at pH 7 in aqueous solution with either 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzylbromide or N-bromosuccinimide yields derivatives in which only 2 of the 4 tryptophan residues are modified. All 4 residues of tryptophan are modified under the similar conditions in 8 M urea. Structural analysis of the modified derivatives revealed that tryptophans 26 and 118 are the sole reactive residues and that tryptophan 118 reacts more rapidly than tryptophan 26. The fluorescence of alpha-lactalbumin modified to varying extents with N-bromosuccinimide indicates that tryptophan 118 is exposed to solvent whereas tryptophan 26 is in a more hydrophobic environment. The chemical reactivities and fluorescence properties of tryptophans 26 and 118 are consistent with the proposed conformations of alpha-lactalbumin based on its similarity with egg white lysozyme. The kinetic properties of both derivatives of alpha-lactalbumin containing up to 2 modified residues indicate that each derivative has decreased affinity for the galactosyltransferase but that at saturating concentrations, Km and Vmax for lactose synthesis are unchanged from those of native alpha-lactalbumin."

The molecular weight of the protein was determined as 76,000 +/- 2,000 from its electrophoretic mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels and 75,000 from its elution volume in Sephadex G-100 columns. Reduction and alkylation of the protein failed to generate smaller subunits. The amino acid composition of the protein showed that it was relatively rich in glutamic and aspartic acids, which together comprised 25% of its total residues. Hydrophobic amino acids like phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, methionine, alanine, proline, and cystine accounted for about 34% of the total residues in the protein. No free NH2-terminal amino acid could be detected in the purified protein by the dansylation method. Each mole of protein contained 11 mol of phosphate. Triton X-100 was necessary for achieving nondestructive disaggregation of the acidic protein. Each mole of protein bound about 3200 mol of Triton X-100 or 10 mol of Congo red. While the detergent binding could be reversed by dialysis, Congo red formed a stable complex with the protein."
