https://openalex.org/W1971412067,"The activity of single neurons in precentral cortex of unanesthetized monkeys (Macaca mulatta) was conditioned by reinforcing high rates of neuronal discharge with delivery of a food pellet. Auditory or visual feedback of unit firing rates was usually provided in addition to food reinforcement. After several training sessions, monkeys could increase the activity of newly isolated cells by 50 to 500 percent above rates before reinforcement."

https://openalex.org/W1570863898,"Abstract Several mammalian tissues have been shown to contain as many as three acid phosphatases which may be separated on the basis of differences in size by gel filtration on Sephadex G-75. The smallest of these enzymes from bovine liver, termed acid phosphatase III, has been purified to apparent homogeneity. The purified enzyme migrates as a single band during electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gel and yields arginine as the only detectable amino terminal residue. Acid phosphatase III has been characterized with respect to its substrate specificity, molecular weight, and amino acid composition. The Km value determined with p-nitrophenyl phosphate, the most readily hydrolyzed substrate tested, is 7.5 x 10-4 m. Optimal rates of hydrolysis were observed at pH 5.5. The pure enzyme is stabilized by ethylenediaminetetraacetate and phosphate ion, but is rapidly inactivated in the presence of Mg++ or mercaptoethanol. The molecular weight of acid phosphatase III determined by sedimentation equilibrium analysis is 16,590. This figure is in close agreement with the value of 16,296 obtained from the amino acid composition."

https://openalex.org/W1994994439,"ALLOGRAFT immunity and delayed hypersensitivity reactions are caused chiefly by the action of host immune lymphoid cells1. Although these reactions have been much studied in vivo and in vitro, the mechanism of cell destruction is essentially unknown. There have been reports from this laboratory that a cell-free toxic factor released by immune and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated non-immune mouse lymphocytes is essential in the in vitro destruction of target L cells2. This factor, termed lymphotoxin (LT), caused in vitro cytolysis of both continuous and primary cells obtained from many animal species3. Later work showed that lymphocytes from various animal species, including man, could be stimulated in vitro to release LT, in the absence of target cells, by treatments which induce lymphocyte transformation, that is the mixed lymphocyte reaction, PHA and xenogeneic antibody4. It was therefore of interest to investigate whether lymphoid cells obtained from animals with delayed hypersensitivity to soluble antigens could be induced in vitro to release LT-like materials. We wish to report here that in the case of tuberculin hypersensitivity in mice, guinea-pigs and man, non-specific toxic materials are released when the cells are cultured in the presence of specific antigen."

https://openalex.org/W1502389520,"Abstract The β-isozyme of mushroom tyrosinase is composed of an equilibrium mixture of polymeric forms with the tetramer predominating. What appears to be a similar equilibrium mixture is also present in fresh mushroom juice. In the purified β-isozyme, under moderate conditions of ionic strength, temperature, and protein concentration, the interconversion among the forms is slow. The equilibrium is shifted toward association to the higher polymers by increasing protein concentration. Dissociation is facilitated by elevated temperature (50°), increased ionic strength (0.2), and the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.25%). Dissociation of the tetramer is also brought about by 1 mm EDTA and is completely reversed by the presence of 1 mm Ca++. Certain chemical modifications of the enzyme such as succinylation, acetylation, or iodination are accompanied by dissociation. Band III of gel electrophoresis is identified with the tetramer, and the other prominent bands, I-Ia, II, and V, are tentatively identified as monomer, dimer, and octamer, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1481524976,"Abstract An enzyme has been prepared from rat spleen which catalyzes the transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to cytosine moieties in DNA. This enzyme, which has been purified about 200-fold from the crude homogenate, differs from the known bacterial methylases in several ways, the most important of which is its apparent ability to methylate homologous DNA. The effect of heat denaturation upon the ability of DNA to accept methyl groups depends upon the source of the DNA. S-Adenosylethionine could not replace S-adenosylmethionine as a donor of ethyl groups in place of methyl groups."

A significant correlation was observed between decreased concentration of C'lq and deficient synthesis of immunoglobulin G; C'lq was particularly diminished in subjects with congenital, sex-linked (Bruton) agammaglobulinemia. In contrast, two to five times the normal concentration of C'lq was found in the serum of three patients with heavy chain disease (subtype immunoglobulin G3). No significant relation was found between C'lq and concentrations of immunoglobulins A and M."

Studies of the extract by silicic acid and diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography, thin layer chromatography, and digestion with snake venom indicate that the active component is phosphatidylcholine. Preliminary data suggest that the lecithin must contain unsaturated fatty acids."
https://openalex.org/W1581256861,"Phosphomannose isomerase, which has previously been shown to be a zinc-metalloenzyme (J. Biol. Chem., 243, 4109 (1968)), was studied with respect to the following points: (a) effect of substrate on inhibition by metal-binding agents, (b) effect of zinc on the nonenzymatic isomerization, (c) effect of pH on Michaelis constant and maximal velocity, and (d) affinity of substrate analogues acting as competitive inhibitors. The substrate mannose 6-phosphate was found to protect phosphomannose isomerase from inhibition by o-phenanthroline, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, or dithiothreitol, suggesting that the metal is located in the active center of the enzyme. Zinc was found also to accelerate the nonenzymatic conversion of mannose 6-phosphate to fructose 6-phosphate and is believed to participate in a similar manner in both the nonenzymatic and the enzymatically catalyzed isomerization reactions. From the pH dependence of the kinetic parameters, pK values of 6.6 and 7.8 for the free enzyme and of 6.4 and 8.1 for the enzyme-substrate complex have been determined for two ionizable groups involved in substrate binding and catalysis; the pK values of 6.6 and 6.4 have been assigned to the imidazole group of a histidine residue. Analysis of the inhibition by substrate analogues indicates that the phosphate moiety of the substrate is required for binding and that substrate analogues in the open chain form bind more effectively to the enzyme than the corresponding cyclic compounds. A reaction mechanism is proposed in which the zinc coordinates with the carbonyl and hydroxyl oxygens on C-1 and C-2, thereby activating the hydrogen α to the carbonyl, which is abstracted by the nonprotonated nitrogen of an imidazole group to form the transient enediol intermediate."
https://openalex.org/W1969550965,"After stabilization of response rates engendered by a free-operant avoidance contingency, the lever-pressing of two squirrel monkeys was maintained for several months by a fixed-interval schedule of electric shock presentation. Initially, response-contingent shocks produced substantial increases in response rates. Continued exposure to the schedule resulted in a reduced overall rate accompanied by a change in the temporal patterning of responses. There was a pause in responding after most shock deliveries; the rate of responding then increased during the interval to reach a terminal value preceding shock presentation. Omission of shocks for part of the daily session led to higher rates of responding; the reintroduction of response-contingent shocks produced a lower overall rate and reinstated the temporal patterning of responding characteristic of the fixed-interval schedule."

The results were compared with those obtained from exposure to clean, enclosed, laboratory air of the same temperature and humidity."
https://openalex.org/W110287497,"Abstract Sporulation of Bacillus subtilis is inhibited by low concentrations (l1 mm) of α-picolinic acid, quinaldic acid, o-phenanthroline, and dipyridyl, all agents that chelate transition metals. High concentrations (g1 mm) of these agents also inhibit growth and cause cell lysis. In the presence of the chelating agents, 14C-glutamate produces the accumulation of citrate and 14C-glucose that of fructose 1,6-diphosphate, indicating the inhibition of both aconitase and aldolase in vivo. This finding is in agreement with the noncompetitive inhibition observed for the two metal-dependent enzymes in vitro which results from the removal of metal ions by the chelating agents. The strongest effect on the cellular metabolism is caused by the inhibition of aconitase, as follows from the measurement of 14C-uracil incorporation into acid-precipitable material in the presence of ribose, glutamate, or citrate. These findings and the fact that aconitase mutants can grow but not sporulate in nutrient sporulation medium are sufficient reasons for the conclusion that α-picolinic acid, quinaldic acid, o-phenanthroline, and dipyridyl specifically inhibit sporulation because they inhibit aconitase. At the end of exponential growth, aconitase is derepressed or induced even when the chelating agents are present in concentrations affecting sporulation."

https://openalex.org/W1519848597,"Abstract An improved purification procedure for deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase from extracts of Escherichia coil infected with T5 bacteriophage provides an endonuclease-free enzyme capable of synthesizing high molecular weight deoxyribonucleic acid from single stranded templates. When double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid denatured by heat or alkali is used as template, the base composition of the product is identical with the imput deoxyribonucleic acid. When single stranded material (containing only one of the strands) is used as template, the product is the complement of the input deoxyribonucleic acid. Electron micrographs of the product reveal long, linear molecules with no visible branching. Sedimentation analyses indicate that only a portion of the product is separable from the template."

https://openalex.org/W1525675429,"Abstract The functional and structural properties of sodium deoxycholate-liberated bound and free ribosomes from rat spleen have been compared in vitro. The endogenous amino acid-incorporating activity of bound ribosomes relative to that of free ribosomes (B:F) varies only slightly (71 to 103%) under a variety of isolation and incubation conditions. However, the net exogenous activity for 14C-phenylalanine with the use of polyuridylic acid (poly U) as messenger varies widely (B:F, 11 to 75%) and is greatly dependent on experimental conditions. Minimal translation of poly U and the lowest B:F ratio are seen when the source of supernatant factors is a spleen pH 5 fraction. Maximal translation of poly U and the highest B:F ratio are achieved with a liver pH 5 fraction, isolation of ribosomes in the presence of a rat liver supernatant, the omission of centrifugation through 2 m sucrose, and the addition of a 0.5 m NH4Cl wash. Relative to the minimal system, incorporation is enhanced 54-fold for bound ribosomes and 8-fold for free ribosomes when these optimal conditions are used. Rat spleen bound and free ribosomes are immunologically identical, have similar sedimentation coefficients, similar contents of RNA and nucleotide bases, and virtually identical patterns of polyribosomes and structural and rapidly labeled RNAs. These results caution that different ribosome populations may seem more or less alike functionally, depending upon the particular conditions of isolation and incubation."

https://openalex.org/W1594488088,"Abstract Low concentrations of EDTA were shown to suppress adenylate kinase activity effectively in rat liver mitochondria. As little as 0.075 mm EDTA also prevented the release of controlled respiration induced by AMP, while as much as 7.5 mm EDTA had no effect on the ADP-initiated release. The EDTA inhibition of AMP release was relieved upon the addition of 0.04 mm Mg++. During State 3 oxidation of succinate the molar ratio of nucleotide to extra oxygen consumed was 2.0 with ADP and 1.0 with AMP. All of the 32Pi esterified in the presence of ADP was found in the terminal (γ) phosphoryl group of ATP, while an almost equal distribution between the β- and γ-phosphoryl moieties was found when AMP was used as the acceptor. The ratio of 32Pi esterified to nucleotide added (i.e. 32Pi:ADP or 32Pi:AMP) was found to be 1.0 with ADP and 2.0 with AMP. These results show that ADP is the primary external acceptor for a phosphoryl group in oxidative phosphorylation and that added AMP must be converted to ADP before it can act as a phosphoryl acceptor."
https://openalex.org/W1987734205,Monkeys with bipolar stimulating and recording electrodes in primary auditory cortex were trained to release a key to the onset of a pure tone. Substitution of direct cortical stimulation for the pure tone resulted in a reduction of 15 milliseconds In the latency of the behavioral response. This changed latency agreed with the latency of the primary evoked potential recorded from the animals. Systematic related changes in the amplitude of the central response and in the latency of the behavioral response followed changes in the intensity and frequency of the acoustic stimulus.

https://openalex.org/W1517388712,"Abstract When purified T5-induced deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase is incubated with transforming deoxyribonucleic acid from Bacillus subtilis, there is no detectable loss of transforming ability. By using 5-bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate triphosphate as a density marker and 32P-labeled transforming deoxyribonucleic acid as template, it was shown that after two rounds of synthesis, fractions isolated from the regions of a density gradient equivalent to deoxyribonucleic acid fully substituted with bromuracil and containing no detectable 32P had low but significant transforming activity. When deoxyribonuclease digests are added to incubation mixtures containing single stranded deoxyribonucleic acid and purified T5-induced polymerase, there is a marked stimulation of both the rate and yield. Digests prepared from the same type of deoxyribonucleic acid used as template are more effective than digests of heterologous nucleic acid. From analysis of sedimentation patterns in alkaline sucrose, and from experiments involving gel filtration, it has been found that oligonucleotides present in the digest are incorporated into the product in covalent linkage and probably act as initiators for deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in this system."
https://openalex.org/W1536549844,"Abstract 1. A molecular weight of 187,000 was determined for aldehyde dehydrogenase by calculation from the determined sedimentation and diffusion coefficients, by the method of Archibald, and from gel filtration and sucrose gradient centrifugation with reference enzymes. 2. Aldehyde dehydrogenase contained relatively large amounts of all common amino acids. The lowest proportion was obtained for cysteic acid—22 residues per molecule of active enzyme. 3. Aldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa did not contain zinc. 4. The point of isoelectric precipitation for aldehyde dehydrogenase was pH 4.8. The enzyme was soluble below pH 4.0 but its sedimentation, diffusion, and viscosity behaviors indicated that it was denatured at low pH, to a subunit of molecular weight 95,000. 5. At low ionic strength the enzyme underwent a partial dissociation, probably into two subunits, with the loss of enzymatic activity. This dissociation could be reversed by increasing the salt concentration. Dissociation and association could be followed in the ultracentrifuge and on starch gel electrophoresis. The dissociated form of the enzyme was isolated after starch gel electrophoresis, and was found to be inactive, but reassociation occurred in 0.1 m salt, and reactivation required a reducing agent."

These changes were not due to binding of sodium by cell-wall fragments of cells treated with penicillin. Because penicillin had no effect on cation concentrations in stable protoplasts and nongrowing bacterial cells, this effect appeared to be related to the production of the penicillin-induced lesions of the cell wall."

Others expanded these studies to include extraction of haemagglutinin with high pH buffers from BHK21 suspension cultures infected with rubella virus2. Production of rubella virus haemagglutinin in an established line of African green monkey kidney cells (VERO) was recently reported3. We describe the production of haemagglutinin in the BS-C-1 line of African green monkey cells by two different strains of rubella virus and subsequent establishment of a chronically infected culture which continues to shed virus and haemagglutinin after serial passage.
