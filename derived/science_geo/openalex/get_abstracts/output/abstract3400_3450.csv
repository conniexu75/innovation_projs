https://openalex.org/W2008202623,"Male rats treated with clofibrate, tibric acid, or Wy-14,643 show an 11- to 18-fold increase in the capacity of their livers to oxidize palmitoyl-coenzyme A. This provides a plausible biochemical mechanism for the action of these hypolipidemic drugs in reducing lipid concentrations in the serum."

https://openalex.org/W2155510455,"The actions of 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1,25-(OH)2D3] and parathormone, both effective bone-resorptive agents in vivo and in vitro, were tested on CT (osteoclast-like) and PT (osteoblast-like) bone cells maintained in culture. Both agents stimulated acid phosphatase activity and hyaluronate synthesis in the CT cells and decreased alkaline phosphatase, citrate decarboxylation, and collagen synthesis in the PT cells. Calcitonin inhibited the changes induced in the CT but not in the PT cells. The activity of 1,25-(OH)2D3 differed from that of parathormone in one key respect: it did not increase cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate, whereas parathormone did. Prior incubation of the bone cells with 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 6 to 24 hours made the cells refractory to the effect of parathormone on cyclic adenosine monophosphate formation. These data suggest that 1,25-(OH)2D3 and parathormone induce bone resorption by affecting the same cell types (osteoblasts and osteoclasts) although at different cellular sites."

The selection of antigenic variants under antibody pressure, thought to occur in vivo, was reproduced in sheep cell cultures inoculated with plaque-purified visna virus and maintained in antibody. Antigenic shift may be a mechanism for persistence of virus in slow or recurrent viral infections."

https://openalex.org/W1967522239,"By means of two assay systems, a beta chain human chorionic gonadotropin radioimmunoassay and a radioreceptor gonadotropin assay, a chorionic gonadotropin-like substance was demonstrated in extracts of liver and colon obtained at autopsy from three patients who died of nonneoplastic disease. In contrast to placental chorionic gonadotropin, colon and liver chorionic gonadotropin was not bound to concanavalin A-Sepharose columns, indicating that this substance possessed little or no carbohydrate. Previous workers demonstrated that desialylated human chorionic gonadotropin possesses little or no bioactivity in vivo but retains full radioreceptor and radioimmunoassay activity in vitro. Our data suggest that the genome responsible for the human chorionic gonadotropin production is not completely suppressed in adult nonendocrine tissues, and that the chorionic gonadotropin produced by colon and liver has little or no bioactivity in vivo because of its low carbohydrate content. Since many normal tissues produce chorionic gonadotropin, bioactivity may be modulated by regulation of carbohydrate content."

https://openalex.org/W2024809499,"We demonstrate that the arginine-rich histones H3 and H4 can introduce torsional constraints on closed circular DNA with a concomitant compaction of the nucleic acid. SV40 DNA I complexed with H3 and H4 appears relaxed in electron micrographs and contains particles of 75 +/- 10 A in diameter along the DNA. SV40 DNA I is contracted 2.75 +/- 0.25 fold by all the four smaller histones and 2.6 +/- 0.4 fold by H3 and H4 alone. The arginine-rich histones can cause the topological equivalent of unwinding the DNA close to one Watson-Crick turn per particle formed. Spherical nucleoprotein complexes morphologically similar to isolated nu bodies or nucleosomes are obtained by association of H3 and H4 with 140 base pair length DNA isolated from chromatin core particles. These reconstituted particles sediment at 9.8S, as compared to 10.8S for native core particles, and contain a tetramer of the arginine-rich histones. None of these specific alterations in DNA structure is seen om complexing the slightly lysine rich-histones H2A and H2B to DNA. Our data provide further evidence indicating that the arginine-rich histones are the major determinants of the architecture of DNA within the chromatin core particle."
https://openalex.org/W2031104082,"The tumoricidal capabilities of macrophages can be reversibly inhibited by a lipoprotein of high molecular weight, and the inhibition appears to be reproduced by enrichment of macrophage plasma membranes with cholesterol. A second serum component of lower molecular weight enhances macrophage cytotoxicity. The presence of these components in normal serums suggests a physiological role for such factors in the regulation of macrophage function."
https://openalex.org/W1659250414,"Both 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine and 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine were oxidized with periodate and mushroom tyrosinase to determine whether the latter compound is an intermediate in melanin biosynthesis. Matrix analysis of the spectra obtained with a rapid scan spectrophotometer and comparison of the spectra of quinone intermediates with model quinones disclosed that, although 2,4,5-trihydroxyphenylalanine can be oxidized to 2-carboxy-2,3-dihydroindole-5,6-quinone (dopachrome), this oxidation proceeds through a stable intermediate, 5-(2-carboxy-2-aminoethyl)-2-hydroxy-1,4-benzoquinone, which does not appear in the oxidation of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine to dopachrome. Thus, these studies are in agreement with the original postulate, that 4-(2-carboxy-2-aminoethyl)-1,2-benzoquinone and leukodopachrome are the intermediates in the major pathway for dopachrome synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1991594650,"Pseudotypes of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV), defined by their resistance to neutralization by anti-VSV antiserum, are released preferentially at early times after infection of MuLV-producing cells with VSV. At later times, after synthesis of MuLV proteins has been inhibited by the VSV infection, neither MuLV virions nor the VSV (MuLV) pseudotypes are made. Infection of MuLV-producing cells with mutants of VSV having temperature-sensitive lesions in either G or M protein does not generate pseudotypes at nonpermissive temperature, indicating that both proteins are needed for pseudotypes to form. Although the pseudotypes resist neutralization by anti-VSV serum, they are inactivated by anti-VSV serum plus complement, and they can be precipitated by rabbit anti-VSV serum plus goat anti-rabbit IgG. These results, coupled with experiments using a temperature-sensitive mutant of VSV G protein grown at partly restrictive temperature, suggest that small numbers of VSV G protein are obligately incorporated into VSV(MuLV) pseudotypes. There appears to be a stringent requirement for recognition of the viral core by homologous envelope components as the nucleating step in the budding process. Only after such a nucleation can the envelope components of the second virus substitute into the membrane of the budding particle."
https://openalex.org/W2004603696,"Fibroblasts from European field vole (Microtus agrestis) and from normal rat kidney (NRK) have been infected by avian sarcoma virus mutants which are temperature-sensitive for the maintenance of transformation. These cells are transformed at 33 degrees C, but show normal cell characteristics in morphology, colony formation in agar, saturation density, sugar uptake and membrane proteins at 39 degrees C and 40 degrees C, the nonpermissive temperatures. Ts mutant virus was rescued from most of the ts transformed cell lines. NRK cells infected by avian sarcoma virus ts mutants and kept at the nonpermissive temperature can be transformed by wild-type avian sarcoma virus. The susceptibility of the temperature-sensitive NRK lines to this transformation is higher than the susceptibility of uninfected NRK at either permissive or nonpermissive temperature."

https://openalex.org/W1540839459,"The aim of these experiments was to test whether incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine into DNA affects DNA methylation. Rat hepatoma (HTC) cells in culture were labeled for two generations with [14C]bromodeoxyuridine and [3H]thymidine to yield DNA which was 2.1, 20.6, 52.6, and 95.0% bromodeoxyuridine-substituted in the newly made strands. The DNA then was fractionated into highly repetitive, moderately repetitive, and single copy sequences. As determined by a comparison of 14C and 3H counts per min, the percentage of substitution with bromodeoxyuridine was found to be the same in each repetition class. The 5-methylcytosine content of each fraction was determined using high pressure liquid chromatography. It was found that bromodeoxyuridine, even at a level of substitution into newly mad DNA of 95%, has no effect on the 5-methylcytosine content of DNA. At all levels of bromodeoxyuridine substitution, highly repetitive DNA has slightly more 5-methylcytosine (3.0% of total cytosine) than does single copy DNA or moderately repetitive DNA (2.3%). The 5-methylcytosine content of whole HTC DNA is the same as that of rat liver DNA (2.4%)."

https://openalex.org/W1592215538,"Guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterases, which appear to be under allosteric control, have been partially purified from rat liver supernatant and particulate fractions. The preferred substrate for both phosphodiesterases was cGMP (Km values: cGMP less than cIMP less than cAMP). At subsaturating concentrations of substrate, the phosphodiesterases were stimulated by purine cyclic nucleotides. The order of effectiveness for activation of cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis was cGMP greater than cIMP greater than cAMP greater than cXMP. Using cAMP derivatives as activators of cIMP hydrolysis, modifications in the ribose, cyclic phosphate, and purine moieties were shown to alter the ability of the cyclic nucleotide to activate the supernatant enzyme. cGMP, at concentrations that stimulated cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis, enhanced chymotryptic inactivation of the supernatant phosphodiesterase. At similar concentrations, cAMP was not effective. It appears that on interaction with appropriate cyclic nucleotides, this phosphodiesterase undergoes conformational changes that are associated with increased catalytic activity and enhanced susceptibility to proteolytic attack. Divalent cation may not be required for the nucleotide-phosphodiesterase interaction and resultant change in conformation."
https://openalex.org/W193046695,"In WI-38, a normal human fibroblast, the rates of degradation of short lived and long lived proteins are identical whether the cultures are growing exponentially or are density-inhibited. Replacement of the growth medium with fresh medium does not alter these rates. In VA-13, an SV-40 transformed derivative of WI-38, the rates of protein degradation are also independent of growth rate and fresh medium. However, in both WI-38 and VA-13 the rate of long lived protein degradation increases as the serum concentration is reduced below 5%. After complete serum withdrawal, the rate increases by 60 to 100% in both cell types. Withdrawal of arginine and phenylalanine triples the rate of long lived protein degradation, while addition of 10% dialyzed serum to this amino acid-deficient medium reduces the effect to twice that of the controls. Incubation of both types of cells in phosphate-buffered saline also increases protein degradation. This effect is reduced by glucose, albumin, and dialyzed serum. Therefore, the rate of protein degradation is independent of growth rate in normal and transformed human cells. However, the rate of degradation is closely coupled to certain medium alterations."

https://openalex.org/W1991413872,"Indirect immunofluorescence of intact or acetone-extracted cells has allowed us to distinguish concanavalin A (Con A) which is associated with the plasma membrane of CHO cells from Con A which has been interiorized. We find that Con A is directly endocytized by these cells with no intervening stage of plasma membrane aggregation. The lectin accumulations observed by direct fluorescence are actually cytoplasmic collections of pinosomes which contain Con A. Only in a small fraction of CHO cells are true plasma membrane aggregates, or caps, found. This predominance of direct pinocytic interiorization over capping was not affected by dibutyryl cAMP or by treatments which can disrupt microtubules, including cold shock or exposure of the cells to anti-mitotic agents. Cytochalasin B, however, inhibited the uptake of Con A and at the same time promoted the formation of large surface aggregates of the lectin, or minicaps. Capping may reflect a competition between aggregation in the plane of the membrane and direct interiorization of bound lectin. Surface cap formation may be a characteristic process of cells with very low endocytic rates, such as lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1482889173,"The molecular properties of apo-C-I, isolated from the human high density lipoprotein complex, have been evaluated as a function of pH, solvent composition, and protein concentration by sedimentation equilibrium and circular dichroic measurements. This protein self-associates in aqueous solution at neutral pH with concomitant changes in secondary structure. In contrast, in the acid pH range, apo-C-I is monomeric and its ellipticity is independent of protein concentration. The results are discussed in terms of the interpretation of experiments where changes in the physical properties of apolipoproteins have been used to monitor ligand binding and lipid-apolipoprotein recombination."

https://openalex.org/W1608935054,"Inorganic lead ion in micromolar concentrations inhibits Electrophorus electroplax microsomal (Na+ + K+)-adenosine triphosphatase ((Na+ + K+)-ATPase) and K+-p-nitrophenylphosphatase (NPPase). Under the same conditions, the same concentrations of PbCl2 that inhibit ATPase activity also stimulate the phosphorylation of electroplax microsomes in the absence of added Na+. Enzyme activity is protected from inhibition by increasing concentrations of microsomes, ATP, and other metal ion chelators. The kinetics follow the pattern of a reversible noncompetitive inhibitor. No kinetic evidence is elicited for interactions of Pb2+ with Na+, K+, Mg2+, ATP, or p-nitrophenylphosphate. Na+- ATPase, in the absence of K+, and (Na+ + K+)-NPPase activity at low [K+] are also inhibited. ATP inhibition of NPPase is not reversed by Pb2+. The calculated concentrations of free [Pb2+] that produce 50% inhibition are similar for ATPase and NPPase activities. Pb2+ may act at a single independent binding site to produce both stimulation of the kinase and inhibition of the phosphatase activities."
https://openalex.org/W2059332553,"Abstract It has been proposed that different patterns of transcription of simian virus 40 (SV40) at early and late stages of infection may be regulated by the utilization of templates with different configurations. Nucleoprotein complexes isolated from SV40-Infected cell nuclei provide a method of characterizing the templates for late viral mRNA synthesis. These complexes contain RNA polymerase activity and synthesize viral RNA in an in vitro reaction. Most of the reaction products remain bound to the DNA templates, and they have been isolated by sedimentation in sucrose gradients both in the presence and in the absence of sodium dodecylsulfate. After treatment of the reaction products with pancreatic ribonuclease A, the fraction of the nascent SV40 RNA containing the 3′ end forms a stable structure with the template DNA and sediments slightly faster than SV40 DNA I in sucrose gradients. These RNA-DNA hybrid molecules are derived from transcriptional intermediates and contain RNAs ranging in size from 35–200 nucleotides. The radioactive label incorporated in the RNA serves as a marker for the DNA template to which it is bound. Sedimentation of the hybrid molecules in sucrose gradients containing ethidium bromide indicates that the small RNA fragment is bound to a DNA template which is a double-stranded, covalently closed circular molecule with negative superhelical turns. The data demonstrate that SV40 DNA I serves as a template for transcription during the late phase of lytic infection."
https://openalex.org/W1529336595,"Mutants of Escherichia coli K12, defective in phosphatidylserine synthetase (pss), can be isolated as temperature-sensitive, conditional lethals. When cultivated at intermediate temperatures (30 degrees), such mutants contain approximately 3 times more phosphatidylglycerol plus cardiolipin (and less phosphatidylethanolamine) than normal. We now wish to report that, under these conditions, the pss-8 mutant is hypersensitive to certain antibiotics, especially to streptomycin, kanamycin, and gentamicin, although also to ampicillin and novobiocin. At 30 degrees, the membrane protein and fatty acid composition of pss-8 is nearly normal, i.e. identical with an isogenic pss+ organism. Radiochemical labeling and bacteriophage growth studies show that lipopolysaccharide is also unaltered. Therefore, the antibiotic hypersensitivity of pss-8 differs from previously reported hypersensitivities, associated with lipopolysaccharide defects. These results suggest that the polar phospholipid headgroups may play an important role in maintaining the barrier function of the outer gramnegative membrane and that putative inhibitors of the phosphatidylserine synthetase might potentiate the action of numerous antibiotics currently in clinical use."

https://openalex.org/W2062256569,"Growth of mammary carcinoma induced by 7,12-dimethyl-benz(a) anthracene is arrested by either ovariectomy or treatment with N6,O2-dibutyryl cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (dibutyryl cyclic AMP). When this occurs, a new nonhistone protein species becomes the predominant endogenous substrate of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in the tumor nuclei. Phosphorylation of this regression-associated protein ceases when resumption of tumor growth is induced by either the injection of 17 beta-estradiol or cessation of dibutyryl cyclic AMP treatment. Thus phosphorylation of regression-associated protein may play a role in the regression of hormone-dependent mammary tumors."

https://openalex.org/W1582138108,"Protein kinase activity was detected and assayed directly on polyacrylamide gels after disc electrophoresis of the 100,000 X g supernatant fraction of brown adipose tissue of infant rats. Nine major bands of activity were detected, eight of which could be stimulated by cAMP or inhibited by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor protein. This electrophoretic technique revealed heterogeneity in the cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity eluted from DEAE-cellulose by high concentrations of salt, but not in the peak of activity eluted by low concentrations of salt. The catalytic properties and substrate specificities of the kinases in the various bands were studied while the enzymes were still in the gels. The activity in each band differed from each of the others in at least one of these properties. The activities of the protein kinases in brown fat changed as the animals grew, and each band exhibited a distinct and unique developmental pattern. The major changes in kinase activities occurred in the immediate post-parturition period, then at 15 days after birth and at weaning. These developmental stages coincide with the periods during which the tissue undergoes changes in the rate of its proliferation, differentiation, and functional activity."
https://openalex.org/W1584385555,"Carp parvalbumin has been shown to activate rat brain phosphodiesterase in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The concentration of Ca2+ required for half-maximal stimulation is 1.4 X 10(-7) M, whereas rat testis Ca2+-dependent regulator (CDR) of phosphodiesterase required 1.2 X 10(-6) M Ca2+. The difference in the slopes of the two curves demonstrated that the activation induced by parvalbumin was not the result of a small contamination by CDR. In addition, it has been shown that Ca2+ binding to parvalbumin parallels its activation of phosphodiesterase. These data suggest that Ca2+ must bind to a single specific metal binding site before phosphodiesterase can be fully activated."
https://openalex.org/W2138160726,"Livers from fasted or fed pigs were perfused for 5 h with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing human erythrocytes, bovine serum albumin, glucose, and amino acids. Liver viability was estimated by color, consistency, portal pressure, bile flow, electrolyte changes, and glucose levels in the perfusate, urea synthesis, [1-14C]leucine incorporation into protein, oxygen uptake, and histological examination. It was shown that the liver was maintained in good condition throughout the perfusions. The apolipoprotein B (apoB) and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) in the perfusate were measured by solid phase radioimmunoassay. In the fasted state, the amount of apoB released was greatest in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) fraction and the amount was especially high during the 1st h. There was no increase of apoB in this fraction by feeding. The apoB in the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) fraction was less than that in the LDL fraction in the fasted state, and it increased more than 2-fold in the fed animals. The amount of apoA-I was greatest in the 1.21 bottom fraction and was relatively small in the high density lipoprotein (HDL) fraction. The HDL fraction contained approximately one-twentieth as much apoA-I as the 1.21 bottom fraction in the fasted condition. In the fed state, apoA-I in the HDL fraction increased markedly, although the amount was still less than in the 1.21 bottom fraction."

https://openalex.org/W1518743748,"This communication introduces a nuclear relaxation approach for an estimation of the distance between two paramagnetic metal ion sites on a metal-activated enzyme. The method is based on the existence of an exchange of unpaired electron spin magnetizations between the two metals via energy-conserving concerted mutual spin flips which arise from time-dependent dipolar interactions of the electronic magnetizations. This cross-relaxation of electronic magnetizations depends on the inverse sixth power of the intermetal distance and may, under suitable conditions, affect the longitudinal relaxation rate of inner sphere water protons by altering the electron-proton dipolar correlation time when the latter is dominated by electron spin relaxation. The technique is applied to estimate the distance of 5.2 +/- 0.9 A between Mn2+ and Cr3+ in the pyruvate kinase-Mn2+-ATPCr3+ complex and indicates the existence of a van der Waals contact between the hydration spheres of the enzyme- and nucleotide-bound metal ions."

https://openalex.org/W2045892660,"Abstract A new electron microscopic technique, developed by J. Ferguson and R. W. Davis (manuscript in preparation), has been used to investigate the pattern of early transcription in cells infected with simian virus 40 (SV40). DNA binding protein from E. coli and antibody to this protein increase the apparent thickness of single-stranded DNA. Thus the positions of termini and the sizes of individual molecules of RNA can be determined after hybridization to a defined single strand of DNA. Since the concentration of early RNA is very low in cells infected by wild-type SV40, the RNA was prepared from cells infected with the temperature-sensitive mutant tsA 58, where early RNA is greatly over-produced after a shift from permissive to restrictive temperature late in infection. Nuclear or cytoplasmic RNA was hybridized to full-length linear early strands of SV40 DNA. Using the known end points generated by the restriction endonuclease (Eco RI) and an internal marker to define orientation of the strand, the positions of the 5′ and 3′ termini of individual RNA molecules were determined. Most molecules of cytoplasmic early RNA have a 5′ terminus at 0.67 SV40 fractional length, and the majority of the 3′ termini extend well into the late region, at least as far as the Eco RI restriction site at map position 0. The mean 5′ terminus of nuclear early RNA molecules was at 0.68 SV40 fractional length. Many of these molecules are small (0.01–0.20 fractional length), but some extend to the Eco RI restriction site or possibly beyond, as found for the cytoplasmic early RNA. The effects on the composition and size of early RNA pools of the tsA mutation or of exposure to high temperature are unknown."

https://openalex.org/W1518974860,"Abstract When V79 pur 1, a purine-requiring auxotroph of a Chinese hamster cell line, is deprived of adenine, nucleic acid and protein synthesis decline rapidly. However, on continuous starvation RNA and DNA synthesis recommences to reach approximately 30% of the normal level between 12 to 24 h starvation. This is accompanied by a rise in the intracellular nucleotide pool. Utilizing mengovirus, which gives a productive infection in V79 pur 1 cells even under conditions of starvation, we can show that rRNA is preferentially degraded and provides the nucleotides for RNA synthesis. Thus purineless death in mammalian cells is accompanied by turnover of stable RNA."
