https://openalex.org/W2104934425,"Neutrophils engulf and kill bacteria when their antimicrobial granules fuse with the phagosome. Here, we describe that, upon activation, neutrophils release granule proteins and chromatin that together form extracellular fibers that bind Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. These neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) degrade virulence factors and kill bacteria. NETs are abundant in vivo in experimental dysentery and spontaneous human appendicitis, two examples of acute inflammation. NETs appear to be a form of innate response that binds microorganisms, prevents them from spreading, and ensures a high local concentration of antimicrobial agents to degrade virulence factors and kill bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2113601822,"We have applied âwhole-genome shotgun sequencingâ to microbial populations collected en masse on tangential flow and impact filters from seawater samples collected from the Sargasso Sea near Bermuda. A total of 1.045 billion base pairs of nonredundant sequence was generated, annotated, and analyzed to elucidate the gene content, diversity, and relative abundance of the organisms within these environmental samples. These data are estimated to derive from at least 1800 genomic species based on sequence relatedness, including 148 previously unknown bacterial phylotypes. We have identified over 1.2 million previously unknown genes represented in these samples, including more than 782 new rhodopsin-like photoreceptors. Variation in species present and stoichiometry suggests substantial oceanic microbial diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2070257026,Multiproxy reconstructions of monthly and seasonal surface temperature fields for Europe back to 1500 show that the late 20th- and early 21st-century European climate is very likely (&gt;95% confidence level) warmer than that of any time during the past 500 years. This agrees with findings for the entire Northern Hemisphere. European winter average temperatures during the period 1500 to 1900 were reduced by ∼0.5°C (0.25°C for annual mean temperatures) compared to the 20th century. Summer temperatures did not experience systematic century-scale cooling relative to present conditions. The coldest European winter was 1708/1709; 2003 was by far the hottest summer.

The effect is realized over a large bandwidth and can be tuned throughout the terahertz frequency regime by scaling the dimensions of the structure. We suggest that artificial magnetic structures, or hybrid structures that combine natural and artificial magnetic materials, can play a key role in terahertz devices."
https://openalex.org/W1995907191,"Complex biological, technological, and sociological networks can be of very different sizes and connectivities, making it difficult to compare their structures. Here we present an approach to systematically study similarity in the local structure of networks, based on the significance profile (SP) of small subgraphs in the network compared to randomized networks. We find several superfamilies of previously unrelated networks with very similar SPs. One superfamily, including transcription networks of microorganisms, represents ""rate-limited"" information-processing networks strongly constrained by the response time of their components. A distinct superfamily includes protein signaling, developmental genetic networks, and neuronal wiring. Additional superfamilies include power grids, protein-structure networks and geometric networks, World Wide Web links and social networks, and word-adjacency networks from different languages."
https://openalex.org/W2122160419,"The theory of second-order phase transitions is one of the foundations of modern statistical mechanics and condensed-matter theory. A central concept is the observable order parameter, whose nonzero average value characterizes one or more phases. At large distances and long times, fluctuations of the order parameter(s) are described by a continuum field theory, and these dominate the physics near such phase transitions. We show that near second-order quantum phase transitions, subtle quantum interference effects can invalidate this paradigm, and we present a theory of quantum critical points in a variety of experimentally relevant two-dimensional antiferromagnets. The critical points separate phases characterized by conventional ""confining"" order parameters. Nevertheless, the critical theory contains an emergent gauge field and ""deconfined"" degrees of freedom associated with fractionalization of the order parameters. We propose that this paradigm for quantum criticality may be the key to resolving a number of experimental puzzles in correlated electron systems and offer a new perspective on the properties of complex materials."
https://openalex.org/W1980273234,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize molecular patterns displayed by microorganisms, and their subsequent activation leads to the transcription of appropriate host-defense genes. Here we report the cloning and characterization of a member of the mammalian TLR family, TLR11, that displays a distinct pattern of expression in macrophages and liver, kidney, and bladder epithelial cells. Cells expressing TLR11 fail to respond to known TLR ligands but instead respond specifically to uropathogenic bacteria. Mice lacking TLR11 are highly susceptible to infection of the kidneys by uropathogenic bacteria, indicating a potentially important role for TLR11 in preventing infection of internal organs of the urogenital system."
https://openalex.org/W2146881061,"Two categories of objects in the environment—animals and man-made manipulable objects (tools)—are easily recognized by either their auditory or visual features. Although these features differ across modalities, the brain integrates them into a coherent percept. In three separate fMRI experiments, posterior superior temporal sulcus and middle temporal gyrus (pSTS/MTG) fulfilled objective criteria for an integration site. pSTS/MTG showed signal increases in response to either auditory or visual stimuli and responded more to auditory or visual objects than to meaningless (but complex) control stimuli. pSTS/MTG showed an enhanced response when auditory and visual object features were presented together, relative to presentation in a single modality. Finally, pSTS/MTG responded more to object identification than to other components of the behavioral task. We suggest that pSTS/MTG is specialized for integrating different types of information both within modalities (e.g., visual form, visual motion) and across modalities (auditory and visual)."
https://openalex.org/W2116905253,"We have sequenced and annotated the genome of the filamentous ascomycete Ashbya gossypii . With a size of only 9.2 megabases, encoding 4718 protein-coding genes, it is the smallest genome of a free-living eukaryote yet characterized. More than 90% of A. gossypii genes show both homology and a particular pattern of synteny with Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Analysis of this pattern revealed 300 inversions and translocations that have occurred since divergence of these two species. It also provided compelling evidence that the evolution of S. cerevisiae included a whole genome duplication orfusion of two related species and showed, through inferred ancient gene orders, which of the duplicated genes lost one copy and which retained both copies."
https://openalex.org/W1997005541,"Attention modulates our subjective perception of time. The less we attend to an event's duration, the shorter it seems to last. Attention to time or color stimulus attributes was modulated parametrically in an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study. Linear increases in task performance were accompanied by corresponding increases in brain activity. Increasing attention to time selectively increased activity in a corticostriatal network, including pre–supplementary motor area and right frontal operculum. Increasing attention to color selectively increased activity in area V4. By identifying areas whose activity was specifically modulated by attention to time, we have defined the core neuroanatomical substrates of timing behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1968266351,"In the Old World, some mosquitoes in the Culex pipiens complex are excellent enzootic vectors of West Nile virus, circulating the virus among birds, whereas others bite mainly humans and other mammals. Here we show that, in northern Europe, such forms differing in behavior and physiology have unique microsatellite fingerprints with no evidence of gene flow between them, as would be expected from distinct species. In the United States, however, hybrids between these forms are ubiquitous. Such hybrids between human-biters and bird-biters may be the bridge vectors contributing to the unprecedented severity and range of the West Nile virus epidemic in North America."
https://openalex.org/W2027136734,"Recently, a family of temperature-activated ion channels has been identified in mammalian and nonmammalian species that appear to contribute to thermosensation. Two of these proteins, TRPV3 and TRPV4, are ion channels activated by modest increases in ambient temperature. Localization studies have indicated that both proteins, in addition to being expressed in sensory neurons, are also expressed in skin keratinocytes. These and other findings have suggested that keratinocytes might act in concert with sensory neurons to perceive our thermal environment. In this study, we demonstrate that primary keratinocytes isolated from mouse skin exhibit two distinct heat-evoked current responses to mild increases in ambient temperature. The more common of these response types bears considerable similarity to responses mediated by recombinant TRPV4, is absent in mice lacking this ion channel, and is restored upon TRPV4 reintroduction. The second, rarer response strongly resembles those mediated by recombinant TRPV3. Together, these findings demonstrate that keratinocytes can indeed act as thermosensory cells and that they do so via at least two distinct transduction mechanisms.

The skin forms an interface with our surroundings that is simultaneously protective and perceptual. The outermost skin layer, the epidermis, consists predominantly of stratified epithelial cells that differentiate to form a superficial layer of keratin-filled squamous cells together with dendritic cells, melanocytes, and sensory nerve endings. According to conventional dogma, nerve endings mediate the sensory functions of skin, whereas keratinocytes account for the mechanical and chemical barrier properties of the skin. However, this dichotomy may be overly simplistic. For instance, keratinocytes release substances such as neurotrophins and opioids that can sensitize or desensitize adjacent nerve endings (1Tron V.A. Coughlin M.D. Jang D.E. Stanisz J. Sauder D.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1085-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 2Khodorova A. Navarro B. Jouaville L.S. Murphy J.E. Rice F.L.

Along similar lines, recent data, described in the next paragraph, have led to speculation that keratinocytes might act as thermosensory cells that transmit information regarding ambient temperature to “warmth-sensitive” afferents. TRPV1 is a cation channel originally identified as the receptor for the pungent vanilloid compound, capsaicin (3Caterina M.J. Julius D. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). TRPV1 can alternatively be activated by low pH or painfully hot temperatures (i.e. >42 °C). Responses to noxious heat are diminished in mice lacking TRPV1, and responses to moderately hot temperatures (42-52 °C) are undetectable in TRPV1 null sensory neurons in vitro. Still, considerable heat responsiveness remains in TRPV1 knockout mice and in skin-nerve preparations explanted from them. These results demonstrate the existence of TRPV1-independent mechanisms of noxious heat transduction and suggest that such mechanisms may involve other cell types in addition to sensory neurons. The process by which mammals detect innocuous warm temperatures is even less well understood than that underlying thermal nociception despite the fact that nerve fibers responsive to warmth (i.e. 30-42 °C) were first identified decades ago (4Hensel H. Iggo A. Witt I. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1960; 153: 113-126Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Two TRPV1-related ion channel proteins, TRPV3 and TRPV4, are expressed in sensory neurons and can be activated by ambient temperatures exceeding ∼30-35 °C when expressed heterologously (5Liedtke W.

In vivo, TRPV4 has been implicated in sensory neuron responsiveness to hypoosmolarity and mechanical nociception (11Alessandri-Haber N. Yeh J.J. Boyd A.E. Parada C.A. Chen X. Reichling D.B.

As of yet, however, the potential contributions of neither TRPV3 nor TRPV4 to innocuous warmth perception have been explored. Interestingly, TRPV3 and TRPV4 protein and/or mRNA have been detected not only in sensory neurons but also in keratinocytes (6Guler A.D. Lee H. Iida T. Shimizu I. Tominaga M. Caterina M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6408-6414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Peier A.M. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Moqrich A. Earley T.J. Hergarden A.C. Story G.M. Colley S. Hogenesch J.B. McIntyre P. Bevan S.

Moreover, the mouse keratinocyte-derived 308 cell line expresses both TRPV3 and TRPV4 and responds to gentle heating with currents that exhibit many features of recombinant TRPV4 (13Chung M.K. Lee H. Caterina M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32037-32046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). TRPV4-mediated responses to warm temperatures have also been reported in endothelial cells (7Watanabe H. Vriens J. Suh S.H. Benham C.D. Droogmans G. Nilius B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47044-47051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 14Vriens J. Watanabe H. Janssens A. Droogmans G. Voets T. Nilius B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Still, there is no direct evidence that primary keratinocytes exhibit functional responses to heat. The objectives of this study were, therefore, to determine whether primary keratinocytes dissociated from mouse skin respond to warm temperatures and to evaluate the potential involvement of TRPV3 and/or TRPV4 in any such responses. Knockout Mice—Wild-type C57Bl/6 mice and TRPV4 -/- mice (12Suzuki M. Mizuno A. Kodaira K. Imai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22664-22668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar) backcrossed four generations onto a C57Bl/6 background were used for all studies. Protocols were approved by the Johns Hopkins Animal Care and Use Committee. Cell Culture—All drugs and cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen or Sigma. Primary mouse keratinocytes were cultured using a modification of a described method (15Paladini R.D. Coulombe P.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1035-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Newborn mice (postnatal day 1-3) were decapitated, and their limbs were removed. After washing with betadine, water, and 70% ethanol, trunk skin was removed, stripped of fat, and floated (epidermis upward) overnight at 4 °C in a Petri dish containing 0.25% trypsin. The next day the epidermis was peeled from underlying tissue. Keratinocytes were harvested from both surfaces of the dissection plane by flushing with medium or gentle scraping and placed in mouse keratinocyte medium (13Chung M.K. Lee H. Caterina M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32037-32046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Cells were pelleted, resuspended in mouse keratinocyte medium, layered on a density gradient (Lymphoprep, Axis-shield, Oslo, Norway), and centrifuged (15 min, 500 rpm, 4 °C). Keratinocytes, located at the interface of the resulting two layers, were recentrifuged and resuspended, counted, plated at 105/cm2 on glass cover slips, and assayed after 40-80 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Keratinocyte transfection was performed 24 h after cell plating using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) or ExGen 500 (Fermentas, Hanover, MD), and voltage clamp was performed after an additional 24 h.

Electrophysiology—For whole-cell voltage clamp analysis, the recording pipette was filled with internal solution containing 120 mm cesium aspartate, 10 mm CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4, adjusted with CsOH; 295 mosmol, adjusted with mannitol). Osmolarity was measured using a vapor pressure osmometer (Wescor, Logan UT). Cells were superfused with bath solution throughout the experiment. Bath solution contained 130 mm sodium Aspartate, 6 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH; 305 mosmol, adjusted with mannitol). For hypotonic bath solution, sodium aspartate was reduced to 110 mm, reducing the osmolarity to 260 mosmol. Mannitol was added to hypotonic solution to yield a 300 mosmol isotonic solution. In several experiments we used nominally Ca2+-free solution containing 130 mm sodium aspartate, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4, adjusted with NaOH; 305 mosmol, adjusted with mannitol). For evaluation of cationic selectivity, a solution containing 120 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG) aspartate, 12 mm NMDG-Cl, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4, adjusted with NMDG; 305 mosmol, adjusted with mannitol) was used. Because of their flat morphology, cells were treated briefly with trypsin-EDTA just before whole cell recording to facilitate seal formation and membrane capacitance measurement. An Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) connected to a Digidata 1322A analog/digital converter (Axon) was used together with pClamp 9.0 software (Axon) to deliver voltage pulses and acquire and analyze data. Borosilicate glass electrodes had tip resistances of 1.5-2 megaohms when filled with pipette solution. We recorded whole-cell currents only when the series resistance was <7 megaohms without compensation. An agar salt bridge containing 3 m KCl was used throughout the experiment. Data were corrected for liquid junction potential, calculated using pClamp. Membrane capacitance was measured using a capacitance neutralization circuit and ranged from 19 to 71 pF (46 ± 1.9 pF, n = 44) for wild-type keratinocytes and from 21 to 54 pF (37.7 ± 1.6 pF, n = 32) for TRPV4 -/- keratinocytes. It is unclear whether the difference in capacitance reflects cell size differences between genotypes or selection bias during voltage clamp experiments. Data were low pass-filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 3.3 kHz. Heat stimuli were delivered using an in-line heater (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) and monitored with a thermocouple (Physitemp, Clifton, NJ) placed within 4 mm of the microscopic field. Solution exchange was performed using a valve manifold (Warner). In all figures, I-V relationships illustrate raw whole-cell currents in the presence or absence of the indicated stimulus, whereas current density values plotted in bar graphs were calculated after subtracting the pre-stimulus base-line current. Throughout the manuscript, data are expressed as the means ± S.E. of mean (S.E.), n = number of observations. Unless otherwise indicated, statistical comparisons were made with unpaired Student's t test. Expression Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from primary keratinocytes of wild-type and TRPV4 -/- mice with TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed as described (13Chung M.K. Lee H. Caterina M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32037-32046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). TRPV3 and TRPV4 mRNA species were amplified via PCR by denaturation (95 °C, 30 s), annealing (53 °C, 30 s), and elongation (72 °C, 2 min 30 s) over 40 cycles. Primers used for PCR (TRPV3, 5′-TCACCAAGACCTCTCCACC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGTACCACCGACGTTTCTGGGAATTC-3′; TRPV4, 5′-GAGGTACCATGGCAGATCCTGGTGAT-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCCTACAGTGGGGCATCGTCCGTC-3′) were designed to amplify across multiple intron-exon boundaries to avoid genomic DNA amplification. Immunofluorescence analysis of TRPV3 and TRPV4 expression was performed on formalin-fixed cells as described (13Chung M.K. Lee H. Caterina M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32037-32046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, primary keratinocytes from wild-type or TRPV4 -/- mice were lysed using M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions for TRPV4 blotting or lysed using 8 m urea containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for TRPV3 immunoblotting. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-TRPV4 (16Liedtke W. Friedman J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13698-13703Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) (a generous gift of Dr. Stefan Heller), anti-β-actin (Sigma), or anti-TRPV3 (6Guler A.D. Lee H. Iida T. Shimizu I. Tominaga M. Caterina M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6408-6414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at dilutions of 1:5000, 1:5000, and 1:1000, respectively. For peptide competition, TRPV3 antigenic peptide (20 μg/ml) was included with affinity-purified TRPV3 antibody. Keratinocytes Exhibit Two Distinct Current Responses to Warmth—We used whole-cell patch clamp to assay for responses of primary mouse keratinocytes to warm temperature stimuli. We applied a rapid temperature change from 22 to 43 °C maintained for 30s, during which repetitive voltage ramps (-100 to +100 mV over 200 ms) were delivered at 0.5 Hz (Fig. 1A). Upon heating, substantial inward and outward transmembrane currents were observed at negative and positive potentials, respectively. These currents were observed in a majority of cells investigated (170/189) with amplitudes ranging from ∼50 pA to ∼4 nA at +80 mV. In the presence of 2 mm extracellular Ca2+, heat-evoked currents (Iheat) showed strong desensitization during the heat stimulus (Fig. 1A, inset), reverted to near base line upon return to 22 °C, and were much smaller during repeated stimuli. Responses to heat were associated with a shift in reversal potential (Erev) by 11.3 ± 1.3 mV from -5.7 ± 1.6 mV to 5.6 ± 1.5 mV (p < 10-5 in a paired t test, n = 12). The heat-evoked component of these currents, obtained by subtracting currents recorded at 22 °C from the peak currents during heat stimuli, reversed at 9.1 ± 1.4 mV (n = 12). The current-voltage relationship (I-V) of Iheat showed weak outward rectification; the amplitude of outward currents at +80 mV (16.3 ± 1.6 pA/pF, n = 12) was larger than that of inward currents at -80 mV (-6.5 ± 0.6 pA/pF, n = 12) by 2.5 ± 0.1-fold (n = 12). During slow heat ramps (22-40 °C over ∼60 s) current amplitudes increased slightly with temperature below 30 °C but showed a steep increase once the temperature reached ∼ 32 °C and desensitized at temperatures >∼38 °C (Fig. 1B). When all extracellular cations were replaced with the impermeant cation NMDG after Iheat activation (Fig. 1C), inward current was virtually eliminated, with almost no effect on outward current and a shift in Erev from -0.9 ± 1.1 to -53.8 ± 4.4 mV (n = 6, p < 10-4, paired t test). Thus, most primary keratinocytes exhibit a weakly rectifying, desensitizing, cationic current activating in the warm temperature range. In a very small proportion of cells (5/189) a second type of heat-evoked response was observed (Fig. 1D). During heating to 43 °C, repeated voltage ramps revealed currents showing a strong outward rectification with a Erev of -4.3 ± 3.0 mV. Unlike the current responses described above, the amplitudes of these currents tended to increase slowly during the heat stimulus and to sensitize with repeated stimulation. In two cases, two distinct current components were identifiable in the same cell; one, like those observed in the majority of keratinocytes, that was rapidly activating and desensitizing, with weak outward rectification followed by one that was slowly activating and sensitizing, with strong outward rectification (Fig. 1E). The difference in rectification between these two components could be most easily appreciated when the current amplitudes were normalized (Fig. 1F). These strongly and weakly rectifying I-V relationships resembled those of heat-evoked currents mediated by recombinant TRPV3 (8Peier A.M. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Moqrich A. Earley T.J.

Indeed, when mouse TRPV3 was heterologously expressed in cultured primary keratinocytes, the resulting heat-evoked currents exhibited the same properties as the rarer, sensitizing endogenous keratinocyte currents (Fig. 1G). Consistent with these findings, reverse transcription-PCR revealed the presence of transcripts encoding both TRPV3 and TRPV4 in the primary keratinocyte cultures (Fig. 2A). Immunostaining with TRPV3- and TRPV4-specific antisera revealed the presence of both proteins in nearly all cells (Fig. 2, B and C). As in the 308 keratinocyte cell line (13Chung M.K. Lee H.

In both cases immunoreactivity was absent upon competition with antigenic peptide (not shown). Immunoblotting of whole-cell lysates derived from the cultured keratinocytes with anti-TRPV3 revealed a discrete band at ∼117 kDa and a more diffuse band between 150 and 200 kDa (Fig. 2E). Immunoblotting with anti-TRPV4 revealed bands at ∼102, 106, and 115 kDa (Fig. 2F), consistent with previous results from the 308 cell line and with reports that TRPV4 can exist in glycosylated form (17Xu H.

Although TRPV1 is expressed at highest levels in primary nociceptive neurons (3Caterina M.J. Julius D. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar), immunohistochemistry has revealed it to be expressed at lower levels in a number of other neuronal and non-neuronal cells, including skin keratinocytes (18Denda M.

Denda S. Denda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Indeed, capsaicin has been shown to activate immortalized human keratinocyte-derived cell lines in vitro (19Inoue K. Koizumi S. Fuziwara S. Denda S. Denda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 20Southall M.D. Li T. Gharibova L.S. Pei Y. Nicol G. Travers J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We, therefore, explored whether TRPV1 might mediate some of the warmth responsiveness of primary mouse keratinocytes. As in the 308 cell line (13Chung M.K. Lee H. Caterina M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32037-32046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), capsaicin (10 μm) failed to evoke any detectable currents in these cells (data not shown). This observation together with the fact that the currents we observed were evoked at temperatures far lower than the threshold for TRPV1, suggests that this molecule is unlikely to account for the responses described in this study. Desensitizing Warmth-evoked Currents Exhibit TRPV4-like Pharmacology—TRPV4 was originally identified as a sensor of hypoosmolarity (5Liedtke W. Choe Y. Marti-Renom M.A. Bell A.M. Denis C.S. Sali A.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 485: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Moreover, osmolarity affects TRPV4 responsiveness to heat (6Guler A.D. Lee H. Iida T. Shimizu I. Tominaga M. Caterina M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 6408-6414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated the effect of hypoosmolarity on the TRPV4-like keratinocyte Iheat (Fig. 3A). We pretreated cells with 260-mosmol external solution for 30 s, in response to which no measurable change in base-line current was observed (n = 6). However, Iheat recorded in hypotonic solution was significantly and consistently larger than that recorded in isotonic solution (current amplitudes at -80 mV and +80 mV: isotonic, -7.7 ± 0.6 and 17.0 ± 2.2 pA/pF; hypotonic, -13.4 ± 2.3 and 32.4 ± 4.9 pA/pF, n = 6, p < 0.05 in both groups), consistent with a role for TRPV4. We next evaluated the effect of ruthenium red (RR, 1 μm), a nonselective TRPV channel blocker (8Peier A.M. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Moqrich A. Earley T.J. Hergarden A.C. Story G.M. Colley S.

Nature. 1999; 398: 436-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar), on Iheat (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, RR alone applied at 24 °C induced an increase in outward current that began within ∼10 s and exhibited a time constant of 31.9 ± 7.7 s (n = 8) without a corresponding inward current. When heat was applied after RR pretreatment, the outward current increased further together with a very small increase in inward current. Under these conditions the inward Iheat amplitude was ∼39% that recorded in the absence of RR (RR, -2.1 ± 0.7 pA/pF; control, -5.2 ± 0.9 pA/pF at -80 mV, n = 6, p < 0.05), whereas the outward current was ∼195% that of control (RR, 26.0 ± 5.6 pA/pF; control, 13.3 ± 2.7 pA/pF; n = 6, p < 0.05). After an initial rise, the outward current typically desensitized despite continuation of the heat stimulus. In many cases, the resulting amplitude after desensitization was much smaller than that before the heat stimulus. In separate experiments conducted in the absence of external Ca2+ and with a stimulus temperature of 38 °C, RR application after Iheat had reached its peak, reduced the inward current to 31.1 ± 7.4% that of control at -80 mV, and enhanced the outward component to 370.7 ± 104.9% that of control at +80 mV(n = 5). Exposure of keratinocytes to the TRPV4 agonist 4α-PDD (10 μm) (26Watanabe H. Davis J.B. Smart D. Jerman J.C. Smith G.D. Hayes P. Vriens J. Cairns W. Wissenbach U. Prenen J. Flockerzi V. Droogmans G.

Chem. 2002; 277: 13569-13577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) evoked a delayed-onset current response appearing 63 ± 13 s after the initiation of drug exposure and peaking at 145 ± 14 s (n = 6) (Fig. 3C). The current activated by 4α-PDD showed a weak rectification ratio (2.0 ± 0.2 at ±80 mV, n = 6) compared with that of Iheat. However, the current density after subtraction of base line (77.2 ± 7.3 pA/pF, -40.2 ± 5.1 pA/pF at -80 mV and +80 mV, respectively, n = 6) was far greater than that of Iheat. The current reversed at 6.8 ± 2.3 mV, compared with -5.7 ± 2.3 mV before 4α-PDD stimulation (p < 0.005, n = 6). Heating to 42 °C after 4α-PDD washout evoked a further increase in current amplitude. As with RR, the current rapidly desensitized during the heat stimulus to an amplitude lower than that observed before heating. TRPV4 Is Essential for the Desensitizing Warmth-evoked Current Responses—To more definitively establish whether the desensitizing warmth-evoked keratinocyte current was dependent upon TRPV4, we assayed primary keratinocytes derived from TRPV4 -/- mice (12Suzuki M. Mizuno A. Kodaira K. Imai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22664-22668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Reverse transcription-PCR confirmed the absence of full-length TRPV4 mRNA (Fig. 2A), whereas immunoblotting revealed the absence of the expected TRPV4-immunoreactive bands from these cells. Unlike primary keratinocytes derived from wild-type mice, none of the 80 TRPV4 -/- keratinocytes tested exhibited detectable heat-evoked currents (Fig. 4A), even with repeated exposure to 48 °C (not shown). Moreover, hypotonic conditions did not induce or enhance current responses alone or in combination with heat (Fig. 4A). Likewise, neither RR (1 μm, Fig. 4B) nor 4α-PDD (10 μm, Fig. 4C) evoked any increase in current amplitude at 24 or 42 °C. In contrast, adenosine triphosphate (ATP, 100 μm) evoked equally robust, desensitizing inward currents in cells of both genotypes (-52 ± 10.6 pA/pF in TRPV4 +/+ and -56.3 ± 15.7 pA/pF in TRPV4 -/- at -60 mV, n = 8, p > 0.4), indicating that the cells were electrophysiologically responsive and consistent with the report that keratinocytes express ATP-gated ion channels (27Denda M. Inoue K. Fuziwara S. Denda S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 119: 1034-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Because the TRPV4 gene was disrupted within the region encoding the cytosolic amino terminus (12Suzuki M. Mizuno A. Kodaira K. Imai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22664-22668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), it is possible that an aberrant or alternatively spliced form of the TRPV4 protein is produced in these animals. Indeed, reverse transcription-PCR using primers 3′ of the site of gene disruption revealed that a transcript is produced from this region (not shown). Moreover, TRPV4-like immunofluorescence persists in cultured"

Here, CD8 T lymphocytes were found to recognize a nonameric peptide on melanoma cells that comprises two noncontiguous segments of melanocytic glycoprotein gp100(PMEL17). The production of this peptide involves the excision of four amino acids and splicing of the fragments. This process was reproduced in vitro by incubating a precursor peptide of 13 amino acids with highly purified proteasomes. Splicing appears to occur by transpeptidation involving an acyl-enzyme intermediate. Our results reveal an unanticipated aspect of the proteasome function of producing antigenic peptides."

In whole-cell recordings, both CRF and ethanol enhanced gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated (GABAergic) neurotransmission in CeA neurons from wild-type and CRF2 receptor knockout mice, but not CRF1 receptor knockout mice. CRF1 (but not CRF2) receptor antagonists blocked both CRF and ethanol effects in wild-type mice. These data indicate that CRF1 receptors mediate ethanol enhancement of GABAergic synaptic transmission in the CeA, and they suggest a cellular mechanism underlying involvement of CRF in ethanol's behavioral and motivational effects."
https://openalex.org/W2165568231,"Fibroblast proliferation, differentiation into myofibroblasts, and increased collagen synthesis are key events during both normal wound repair and fibrotic lesion formation. Here we report that these biological responses to TGF-beta by fibroblasts are regulated via a CTGF-dependent pathway in concert with either EGF or IGF-2. Our studies indicate these responses to TGF-beta are mutually exclusive, and cells that are proliferating do not express alpha-SMA or elevated levels of collagen synthesis. Cells expressing alpha-SMA do not exhibit DNA synthesis but do coexpress higher levels of types I and III collagen mRNA. Thus, fibroblast proliferation and differentiation are controlled by combinatorial signaling pathways involving not only components of the TGF-beta/CTGF pathway, but also signaling events induced by EGF and IGF-2-activated receptors. Collectively, our studies indicate TGF-beta functions as a classic embryonic inducer, initiating a cascade that is controlled by other factors in the cellular environment. We propose a model for this process with regard to wound repair and fibrotic lesion formation that is likely applicable to other instances of CTGF action during embryogenesis."

One of the known causes of MDR is overexpression of drug efflux pumps on cancer cell surfaces that actively extrude anticancer drugs out of cells and, thus, eliminate effective intracellular accumulation of these drugs. Human ABCG2 is one of these drug-efflux pumps that can actively transport a wide variety of anticancer drugs, including anthracyclines (1Doyle L.A. Yang W. Abruzzo L.V. Krogmann T. Gao Y. Rishi A.K.

Human ABCG2 is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) membrane transporter superfamily that also includes other drug-efflux pumps, such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1). There are seven subfamilies of human ABC transporters, and ABCG2 belongs to the ABCG subfamily (see the web-sites www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/nomenclature/genefamily/abc.html and nutrigene.4t.com/humanabc.htm for a complete list). Human ABCG2, also known as BCRP, MXR, and ABCP (referred to as ABCG2 in the remaining text), was initially identified and cloned by three independent groups (1Doyle L.A. Yang W. Abruzzo L.V.

ABCG2 shares a spectrum of drug substrates with two other well known MDR-causing ABC transporters, Pgp and MRP1 (4Allen J.D. Schinkel A.H. Mol.

Like other members of the human ABCG subfamily, ABCG2 is a half-transporter with a unique arrangement of its nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and transmembrane domain (TMD). However, unlike most ABC transporters in other ABC subfamilies, which usually have a common domain organization of TMD1-NBD1-TMD2-NBD2, ABCG2 has an organization of NBD-TMD, with the NBD located at the amino terminus. ABCG2 has been thought to function as a homodimer (1Doyle L.A. Yang W. Abruzzo L.V. Krogmann T. Gao Y. Rishi A.K. Ross D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The hypothesis that ABCG2 functions as a homodimer was supported by a study which showed that two differentially tagged ABCG2s co-precipitated with each other and that disulfide bonds existed between the two ABCG2 subunits (10Kage K.

To test this hypothesis, perfluoro-octanoic acid (PFO) and Triton X-100 were used to extract ABCG2 from MCF-7/AdrVp3000 cells that overexpress ABCG2; the oligomeric status of ABCG2 was determined using PFO-PAGE, sucrose density gradient sedimentation, gel filtration chromatography, and immunoprecipitation. We found that the monomeric and homodimeric ABCG2s did not exist as major forms and that most human ABCG2s exist as homotetramers in plasma membranes.

Monoclonal antibody BXP-21 against ABCG2, anti-HA antibody, and protein G-Sepharose 4B were from ID Labs, Covance, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively.

Cell Culture and Plasma Membrane Preparation—MDR cell lines MCF-7/AdrVp3000 and S1-M1–80 were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in IMEM and RPMI 1640 medium, respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. To maintain the drug-resistance phenotype, 3000 ng/ml adriamycin and 5 μg/ml verapamil were included in IMEM and 80 μm mitoxantrone was included in RPMI, as previously described (20Robey R.W.

The membrane pellet was resuspended in STBS (250 mm sucrose, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5) and stored at –80 °C. The protein concentration of the membranes was determined using BioRad protein assay kit. PFO-PAGE Analysis—Extraction of ABCG2 from membranes with PFO and PFO-PAGE were performed as described by Ramjeesingh et al. (24Ramjeesingh M. Li C. Kogan I. Wang Y. Huan L.J. Bear C.E.

Briefly, 2–4 μ g of plasma membranes in STBS were mixed with an equal volume of 2× PFO extraction sample buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 0.5–8% PFO) followed by addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) to a final concentration of 25 mm and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatants were loaded onto the freshly prepared 7.5% Tris/glycine polyacrylamide gel without SDS. Electrophoresis was performed at 100 V at 4 °C using the running buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 8.5, 192 mm glycine, and 0.1% PFO. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and ABCG2 was detected using the monoclonal antibody BXP-21 by enhanced chemiluminescence, as described previously (22Zhang M. Wang G. Shapiro A. Zhang J.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9728-9736Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Non-denaturing Gel Electrophoresis—10 μ g of plasma membranes in STBS were mixed with an equal volume of 2× Triton X-100 extraction sample buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 20% glycerol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 2% Triton X-100, and 100 mm DTT) followed by incubation at room temperature for 30 min. After centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatants were loaded onto the precast 4–15% gradient Tris/glycine polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed at 140 V at room temperature with running buffer (250 mm glycine and 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3) followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane for Western blot analysis, as described previously (22Zhang M. Wang G. Shapiro A. Zhang J.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9728-9736Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration Chromatography—Gel filtration chromatography was performed on an AKTA purifier system (Amersham Biosciences) with a Superose 6 HR column. 30 μg of plasma membranes were solubilized by 0.5% PFO, 4% PFO, 1% Triton X-100, or 1% SDS in the buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 100 mm DTT for 30 min at room temperature. After clearance of insoluble materials by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatants were injected into the column equilibrated with the running buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% PFO, Triton X-100, or SDS). The elution was collected at 1 ml or 0.5 ml per fraction and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. The retention time of ABCG2 and HA-tagged CFTR was determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting of the collected fractions. Protein markers, including thyroglobulin (669 kDa), laminin (400 kDa and 200 kDa in the presence of DTT), catalase (232 kDa), β-galactosidase (116 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) (Amersham Biosciences), were separated by AKTA purifier under the same conditions and detected by the UV detector of the AKTA purifier. Sucrose Density Gradient Sedimentation—ABCG2 was first extracted from 30 μg of plasma membranes as described above. After clearance by centrifugation, the extracts were layered atop a continuous 20–35% (w/v) sucrose density gradient in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, and 0.1% PFO, 0.1% Triton X-100, or 0.1% SDS. The sedimentation was performed with a Beckman SW41 rotor at 100,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C. Fractions were then collected at 0.5 ml each, and proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis to determine the relative position of ABCG2. Protein markers including thyroglobulin (669 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), and bovine serum albumin (67 kDa) were separated and fractionated under the same conditions and detected by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. Chemical Cross-linking—Chemical cross-linking using DSS was performed as described previously (14Litman T. Jensen U. Hansen A. Covitz K.M. Zhan Z. Fetsch P. Abati A. Hansen P.R. Horn T. Skovsgaard T. Bates S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Confluent cells were washed twice with the KCl/Hepes buffer (90 mm KC1, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) and incubated with 2 mm DSS in the KCl/Hepes buffer with shaking on a nutator for 45 min at 22 °C. Glycine was then added to a final concentration of 2 mm before cells were collected for membrane preparation, followed by separation on a 4–15% continuous gradient precast gel and Western blot analysis. Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—About 3 × 105 MCF-7/AdrVp3000 cells were seeded in a 60-mm dish and cultured for 3 days. The medium was then removed, and the cells were washed twice with PBS and once with DMEM lacking methionine, followed by incubation in the same medium supplemented with 80 μCi [35S]methionine for 8 h. The labeled cells were then washed 3× with PBS and harvested for lysate preparation using the lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% PFO or 1% Triton X-100. The cell lysate was cleared of insoluble materials by centrifugation and used for immunoprecipitation as described previously (25Dong Z. Zhang J.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3942-3951Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of cell lysates were mixed with 10 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose 4B slurry; bovine serum albumin at the final concentration of 2% was included. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifuged to remove Sepharose beads together with nonspecifically bound proteins. 5 μg of anti-ABCG2 monoclonal antibody BXP-21 or normal mouse IgG were added to the supernatant and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h before mixing with 30 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose 4B slurry. The mixture was further incubated for 3 h or overnight at 4 °C with agitation. The immunoprecipitate was collected by centrifugation and washed six times with the PFO or Triton X-100 containing lysis buffer. The final pellet was solubilized in 10 μl of sample buffer for SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Formation of Intermolecular Disulfide Bonds between Human ABCG2 Subunits—In previous studies, it was shown that the human ABCG2 exists as a homodimer with intermolecular disulfide bonds. However, we consistently found that very little or no dimeric human ABCG2 from cell lysate could be detected on non-reducing SDS-PAGE whereas such dimeric ABCG2 was found only with the isolated membranes (Fig. 1). We also found that at best, only about 50% of ABCG2 in isolated membranes have the intermolecular disulfide bonds for the formation of dimers. This observation suggests that the disulfide bond between the ABCG2 subunits was likely formed by oxidation during cell lysis and membrane preparation; it thus raises a question whether human ABCG2 really forms a homodimer in live cells. Furthermore, oligomeric ABCG2 larger than a homodimer was observed after chemical cross-linking in a previous study (14Litman T. Jensen U. Hansen A. Covitz K.M. Zhan Z. Fetsch P. Abati A. Hansen P.R. Horn T. Skovsgaard T. Bates S.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1565: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, it is necessary to investigate whether human ABCG2 is a dimer and whether other oligomeric ABCG2s exist. To prevent the potential problem introduced by the formation of an intermolecular disulfide bond, DTT was used, unless otherwise specified in all experiments described in the following studies. PFO Extraction and PFO-PAGE Analysis of Human ABCG2— To investigate the oligomeric status of human ABCG2, we first employed the method of PFO-PAGE. PFO-PAGE has been used successfully for studying the oligomeric status of both water soluble proteins (26Ramjeesingh M. Huan L.J. Garami E. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 27Yang Z.G. Liu Y. Mao L.Y. Zhang J.T. Zou Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13012-13020Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and membrane proteins (24Ramjeesingh M. Li C. Kogan I. Wang Y. Huan L.J. Bear C.E.

Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) by using a mild ionic detergent, PFO. PFO at appropriate concentrations does not break the non-covalent interactions between protein subunits of an oligomer and, therefore, permits the extraction and determination of oligomeric states of membrane proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or PFO-PAGE. We first tested the optimal PFO concentration to extract human ABCG2 from plasma membranes of MCF7/AdrVp3000 cells using SDS-PAGE and Western blot. As shown in Fig. 2A, PFO at concentrations of 0.5% and above successfully extracted most ABCG2, and the low speed centrifugation (11,000 × g) separated the extracted ABCG2 from the insoluble pellet, whereas 0.25% PFO did not extract ABCG2 from membranes (lanes 1–12). On the other hand, the majority of ABCG2 remained with membrane pellet after low speed centrifugation if untreated by PFO (Fig. 2A, lanes 13–14). Therefore, we used 0.5 and 4% PFO to extract ABCG2 for further oligomeric analysis. Fig. 2B shows the results of PFO-PAGE of ABCG2 extracted by 0.5 and 4% PFO followed by Western blotting analysis. Two major diffused bands of ABCG2 with apparent molecular masses of ∼285 kDa and ∼799 kDa were detected when extracted by 0.5% PFO (Fig. 2B, lane 1), whereas only the 285-kDa band was observed when extracted by 4% PFO (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Assuming that the monomeric ABCG2 has an apparent molecular mass of ∼72 kDa as estimated using SDS-PAGE (30Maliepaard M. Scheffer G.L. Faneyte I.F. van Gastelen M.A. Pijnenborg A.C. Schinkel A.H. van De Vijver M.J. Scheper R.J. Schellens J.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3458-3464PubMed Google Scholar) (see also discussions below), we calculated that the 285-kDa band is likely a tetramer, whereas the 799-kDa band is likely a higher order of oligomerization consisting of ∼11–12 subunits (see Table I). Interestingly, we did not detect any ABCG2 with the size of a dimer on PFO-PAGE. Thus, the minimum unit of the oligomeric human ABCG2 is likely a tetramer and not a dimer as previously thought. A higher degree of oligomerization of ABCG2 may also exist. Similar results were also observed with ABCG2 from another cell line S1-M1–80 (data not shown), suggesting that the oligomeric ABCG2 observed was not due to the use of a specific cell type.Table ISummary of apparent molecular mass (Mr) and oligomeric state of human ABCG2Methods of separationMrNo. of subunits (Mr/72)aThe size of ABCG2 used for calculation is 72 kDa, based upon previous observations from SDS-PAGE (30), whereas 170 kDa was used for the calculation of CFTR (21).

Open table in a new tab Gel Filtration Chromatography Analysis of Human ABCG2 in PFO—The oligomeric status of human ABCG2 was further analyzed by gel filtration chromatography using a Superose 6 HR column following extraction using 0.5 and 4% PFO. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, human ABCG2 extracted with both 0.5 and 4% PFO was detected between fractions with retention times of 11 ml and 17 ml, respectively, with a peak in the fraction of 14 ml. The peak fraction with retention time of 14 ml has an estimated molecular mass of 265 kDa (Fig. 3D), which corresponds to a tetramer (Table I). This observation is consistent with that shown by PFO-PAGE above (see Fig. 2B and Table I). As a control, ABCG2 extracted by SDS has an estimated molecular mass of 60 kDa (Fig. 3, E–G), which corresponds to the size of a monomeric ABCG2 (Table I). Interestingly, the higher form of oligomerization in the presence of 0.5% PFO detected on PFO-PAGE was not detected here using gel filtration chromatography. The reason for this discrepancy is currently unknown, but it may possibly be due to the use of different methods of separation (see “Discussion” below). To further confirm that the estimated size of human ABCG2 in PFO corresponds to a tetramer, we tested the elution profile of human CFTR, another ABC transporter, which has been shown to exist mainly as a homodimer in isolated mammalian plasma membranes (24Ramjeesingh M. Li C. Kogan I. Wang Y. Huan L.J. Bear C.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10700-10706Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Ramjeesingh M. Kidd J.F. Huan L.J. Wang Y. Bear C.E. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3D, the majority of human CFTR in 0.5% PFO was eluted with a retention time of 13.5 ml and an estimated size of 355 kDa, corresponding to a homodimer (Table I). The behavior of CFTR in 1% SDS was also determined as described above for ABCG2. As shown in Fig. 3G, CFTR in SDS was eluted with a retention time of 10 ml; CFTR in SDS has a calculated size of 219 kDa, corresponding to a monomer (Table I). Based on the observations of the CFTR elution profile, we conclude that human ABCG2 separated by gel filtration in PFO is likely a tetramer. Sucrose Density Gradient Sedimentation Analysis of Human ABCG2 in PFO—We next employed sucrose-gradient sedimentation to determine the oligomeric status of human ABCG2. ABCG2 was first extracted with 0.5 and 4% PFO from membranes of MCF-7/AdrVp3000 cells and then subjected to sucrose-gradient sedimentation followed by fractionation, SDS-PAGE, and Western blot for detection. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, ABCG2 was detected between fractions 13 and 20 with a peak in fraction 17, which has an estimated molecular mass of 203 kDa (Fig. 4D). As a control, ABCG2 extracted with 1% SDS was detected between fractions 19 and 22 with a peak in fraction 21 (Fig. 4C), which has an estimated molecular mass of 51 kDa (Fig. 4E). The size of the 203-kDa fraction in the presence of PFO is smaller than the calculated size of a tetrameric human ABCG2 (see Table I). This is likely because of underestimation by sucrose-gradient sedimentation; the size of the monomeric ABCG2 determined in the presence of SDS is ∼30% smaller than the calculated one (see Table I and “Discussion” below). Correction using the value of the monomeric ABCG2 showed that the 203-kDa fraction is likely a tetramer (Table I). It is also noteworthy that the higher form of oligomeric ABCG2 detected using PFO-PAGE was not detected by the use of sucrose-gradient sedimentation. This may be because of the possibility that the higher form of oligomeric ABCG2 is not stable in PFO and is dissociated during the long duration (18 h) of centr"
https://openalex.org/W2104347869,"Late Miocene fossil hominid teeth recovered from Ethiopia's Middle Awash are assigned to Ardipithecus kadabba. Their primitive morphology and wear pattern demonstrate that A. kadabba is distinct from Ardipithecus ramidus. These fossils suggest that the last common ancestor of apes and humans had a functionally honing canine-third premolar complex. Comparison with teeth of Sahelanthropus and Orrorin, the two other named late Miocene hominid genera, implies that these putative taxa are very similar to A. kadabba. It is therefore premature to posit extensive late Miocene hominid diversity on the basis of currently available samples."
https://openalex.org/W2025382468,"Self-incompatibility (SI) response in Brassica is initiated by haplotype-specific interactions between the pollen-borne ligand S locus protein 11/SCR and its stigmatic S receptor kinase, SRK. This binding induces autophosphorylation of SRK, which is then thought to trigger a signaling cascade that leads to self-pollen rejection. A recessive mutation of the modifier (m) gene eliminates the SI response in stigma. Positional cloning of M has revealed that it encodes a membrane-anchored cytoplasmic serine/threonine protein kinase, designated M locus protein kinase (MLPK). Transient expression of MLPK restores the ability of mm papilla cells to reject self-pollen, suggesting that MLPK is a positive mediator of Brassica SI signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2070548606,"Activity-dependent plasticity in the brain arises in part from changes in the number of synaptic AMPA receptors. Synaptic trafficking of AMPA receptors is controlled by stargazin and homologous transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs). We found that TARPs were stable at the plasma membrane, whereas AMPA receptors were internalized in a glutamate-regulated manner. Interaction with AMPA receptors involved both extra- and intracellular determinants of TARPs. Upon binding to glutamate, AMPA receptors detached from TARPs. This did not require ion flux or intracellular second messengers. This allosteric mechanism for AMPA receptor dissociation from TARPs may participate in glutamate-mediated internalization of receptors in synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2046643048,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and several other neurological disorders have been linked to the overactivation of glutamatergic transmission and excitotoxicity as a common pathway of neuronal injury. The beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is centrally related to the pathogenesis of AD, and previous reports have demonstrated that the blockade of glutamate receptors prevents Abeta-induced neuronal death. We show that taurine, a beta-amino acid found at high concentrations in the brain, protects chick retinal neurons in culture against the neurotoxicity of Abeta and glutamate receptor agonists. The protective effect of taurine is not mediated by interaction with glutamate receptors, as demonstrated by binding studies using radiolabeled glutamate receptor ligands. The neuroprotective action of taurine is blocked by picrotoxin, an antagonist of GABA(A) receptors. GABA and the GABA(A) receptor agonists phenobarbital and melatonin also protect neurons against Abeta-induced neurotoxicity. These results suggest that activation of GABA receptors decreases neuronal vulnerability to excitotoxic damage and that pharmacological manipulation of the excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter tonus may protect neurons against a variety of insults. GABAergic transmission may represent a promising target for the treatment of AD and other neurological disorders in which excitotoxicity plays a relevant role."

https://openalex.org/W1988193334,"Although plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is known to stimulate cell migration, little is known about underlying mechanisms. We show that both active and inactive (e.g. cleaved) PAI-1 can activate the Jak/Stat signaling system and stimulate cell migration in chemotaxis, haptotaxis, chemokinesis, and wound healing assays. Moreover, antibodies to the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) and an LRP antagonist (RAP) blocked these motogenic effects of PAI-1, while a PAI-1 mutant that did not bind to LRP failed to activate the Jak/Stat signaling pathway or to stimulate cell migration. PAI-1 had no chemotactic effect on LRP-deficient cells. These results indicate that LRP is a signaling molecule, that it mediates the migration-promoting activity of PAI-1, and that this activity does not require intact, biologically active PAI-1. Activation of this LRP-dependent signaling pathway by PAI-1 may begin to explain how the inhibitor stimulates cell migration in a variety of normal and pathological processes.

The primary fibrinolytic enzyme is plasmin, a potent, broadly acting serine protease that is formed when circulating plasminogen is cleaved and activated by one of two plasminogen activators (PAs), tissue-type (tPA), and urokinase-type (uPA). Until very recently, most studies of this system have focused on the biochemistry and consequences of plasmin generation in a variety of settings including fibrin degradation, tissue remodeling, inflammation, and cancer invasion. However, in recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that uPA, together with its cellular receptor, uPAR (CD87), and its primary inhibitor, PAI-1, may themselves have profound effects on cells and their association with the ECM. Unexpectedly, these very specific effects on the attachment, detachment and migration of cells do not require the presence of plasminogen or the generation of plasmin. The binding of uPA to uPAR on the cell surface increases the adhesive properties of cells by increasing the affinity of uPAR for the ECM protein vitronectin (VN) and for integrin adhesion receptors (1Chapman H.A.

Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). These interactions also induce cell signaling (5Blasi F. Carmeliet P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 932-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 6Degryse B. Curr. Med. Chem. Anti-Inflamm. Anti-Allergy Agents. 2003; 2: 237-259Crossref Google Scholar, 7Ossowski L.

Because uPAR is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, the observed signaling activity is probably not an inherent property of uPAR itself, but rather an indirect effect of its association with integrins and/or other membrane receptors such as FPLR1 (9Resnati M. Pallavicini I. Wang J.M. Oppenheim J. Serhan C.N. Romano M. Blasi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The binding of uPA to free PAI-1 in solution generates an uPA/PAI-1 complex that is catalytically inactive and has no signaling activity (10Degryse B. Sier C.F.M. Resnati M. Conese M. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, when PAI-1 binds to uPA on the cell surface, it induces the internalization of the resulting PAI-1/uPA/uPAR complex and inhibits uPA-induced cell migration (10Degryse B. Sier C.F.M. Resnati M. Conese M. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 11Nykjær A. Conese M. Christensen E.I. Olson D. Cremona O. Gliemann J. Blasi F.

Thus, PAI-1 can regulate both pericellular proteolysis and the concentration of uPA and uPAR on the cell surface. The binding of PAI-1 to uPA on the cell surface also leads to the deactivation and internalization of integrins that are bound to uPAR, inducing cell detachment (13Czekay R.-P. Aertgeerts K. Curriden S.A. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Finally, PAI-1 binds to VN and inhibits the adhesion and/or migration of cells on this ECM by blocking integrin and/or uPAR binding sites (14Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A.

Taken together, these observations suggest that PAI-1 may influence a variety of normal and pathological processes involving cell migration, and this seems to be the case (2Stefansson S. McMahon G.A. Petitclerc C. Lawrence D.A. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2003; 9: 1545-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 5Blasi F. Carmeliet P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

The exact mechanism(s) by which PAI-1 influences cell migration remains unclear. Because of its protease inhibitory activity, PAI-1 was originally thought to be an inhibitor of cell migration and invasion (17Kirchheimer J.C. Binder B.R. Remold H.G. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1518-1522PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, PAI-1 can inhibit uPA activity and thus control the pericellular proteolysis that may be required during cell migration through the ECM. Moreover, since the addition of PAI-1 to cells leads to the internalization of the uPA/uPAR complex, PAI-1 also can decrease the levels of uPA and uPAR on the cell surface, possibly decreasing cell migration. In fact, PAI-1 appears to inhibit uPA-mediated chemotaxis by this mechanism (10Degryse B. Sier C.F.M. Resnati M. Conese M. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, PAI-1 is also chemotactic for a variety of cells (10Degryse B. Sier C.F.M. Resnati M. Conese M. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Stahl A. Mueller B.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and is up-regulated in cells that migrate into the denuded area of a wounded cell monolayer (19Pepper M.S. Sappino A.P. Montesano R. Orci L. Vassalli J.-D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These observations suggest a role for PAI-1 in wound healing and cell migration. The apparently conflicting observations that PAI-1 can either inhibit or stimulate cell migration may be related to differences in the local concentration of PAI-1 since low concentrations appear to promote angiogenesis, while high levels inhibit it (reviewed in Ref. 2Stefansson S. McMahon G.A. Petitclerc C. Lawrence D.A. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2003; 9: 1545-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Whatever the case, it seems likely that low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) is involved since the internalization of the uPA/uPAR/integrin complex by PAI-1 is an LRP-dependent process (11Nykjær A. Conese M. Christensen E.I. Olson D. Cremona O. Gliemann J. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2610-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 12Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). LRP is a relatively large macromolecule composed of two subunits, a 515 kDa α-chain and a smaller 85 kDa β-chain that constitute its N- and C-terminal extremities, respectively (reviewed in Refs. 12Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar and 20Neels J.G. van Den Berg B.M. Lookene A. Olivecrona G. Pannekoek H. van Zonneveld A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31305-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Two NPXY motifs are present in the cytoplasmic tail of LRP, and these motifs not only appear to be important for endocytosis, but also are an important connection between LRP and cytoplasmic signaling molecules such as Shc. The observation that LRP is the endocytic receptor involved in the internalization of uPAR (11Nykjær A. Conese M. Christensen E.I. Olson D. Cremona O. Gliemann J. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2610-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 12Herz J. Strickland D.K. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 108: 779-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 21Czekay R.P. Kuemmel T.A. Orlando R.A. Farquhar M.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1467-1479Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) suggests that LRP can regulate uPAR-dependent cell migration. The observation that PAI-1-mediated internalization of uPAR inhibits uPA-dependent cell migration and cell cytoskeleton reorganization (10Degryse B. Sier C.F.M. Resnati M. Conese M. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) is consistent with this idea. Moreover, when the internalization of uPAR is impaired or blocked, cell surface uPAR levels increase and cell motility is enhanced (22Webb D.J. Nguyen D.H. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 123-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Weaver A.M. Hussaini I.M. Mazar A. Henkin J. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14372-14379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further investigate the role of PAI-1 in cell migration. We demonstrate that PAI-1 is a potent chemoattractant molecule, which induces cell migration with corresponding changes in cell morphology, cytoskeleton reorganization, and phosphotyrosine redistribution. Using several PAI-1 mutants and specific inhibitors, we show that the chemotactic activity of PAI-1 does not depend on its interactions with uPA, tPA, or VN, but rather with LRP. This interaction leads to the activation of the Jak/Stat signaling pathway and the induction of cell migration. Materials—Placenta-derived human LRP was a generous gift from Dr. S. K. Moestrup (University of Aarhus, Denmark). A plasmid encoding glutathione S-transferase fused to RAP (GST-RAP) was kindly provided by Dr. J. Kuiper (Leiden University, The Netherlands), and used for expression of GST-RAP in Escherichia coli DH5α as described previously (24Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As the GST tag does not interfere with the binding properties of RAP (24Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GST-RAP was used throughout the present study and is referred to as RAP. The BIACORE®3000 biosensor system, reagents, and CM5 sensor chips (research grade), were from Biacore AB (Uppsala, Sweden). Human fibronectin was from Roche Applied Science. Nonspecific rabbit and mouse IgG, as well as collagen I, formylated peptide fMLP, FITC-, and TRITC-phalloidin were from Sigma. Rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine polyclonal antibody, and anti-mouse IgG rhodamine conjugated F(ab′)2 fragment secondary antibody, were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Mouse anti-human Jak1 and anti-human Stat1 monoclonal antibodies were from BD Biosciences, Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The Jak inhibitor AG-490 was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). VN was purified from human plasma as described (15Deng G. Curriden S.A. Wang S. Rosenberg S. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1563-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against human PAI-1 was generated in rabbits by standard procedures. The polyclonal antibody against human LRP was from RDI, Research Diagnostics (Flanders, NJ), and further purified using the affinity chromatography kit MabTrap G II (Amersham Biosciences). PAI-1 Mutants—The cDNAs for the PAI-1 mutants used in this study were kindly provided by Dr. D. Lawrence (American Red Cross, Rockville, MD), and expressed and purified as described (13Czekay R.-P. Aertgeerts K. Curriden S.A. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The stable PAI-1 mutant (14-1B) behaved like wild-type PAI-1 in the cell migration assays (data not shown). Thus, PAI-1 14-1B was used throughout this study and is referred to as PAI-1. Cleaved PAI-1, which was obtained by limited proteolysis of PAI-1 with elastase (25Berkenpas M.B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was catalytically inactive and did not bind to VN (data not shown). It migrated with a molecular weight of ∼39,000 daltons (not shown) indicating that it was cleaved in the reactive center loop as previously demonstrated (25Berkenpas M.B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PAI-1 mutants Q123K, T333R/A335R, and R346M/M347S have been described previously (25Berkenpas M.B. Lawrence D.A. Ginsburg D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2969-2977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Stefansson S. Petitclerc E. Wong M.K. McMahon G.A. Brooks P.C. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8135-8141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Final endotoxin levels were evaluated using the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate kit QCL-1000 (Bio-Whittaker, Walkersville, MD). Only protein preparations with an endotoxin level of less than 0.14 EU/ml were used. Cell Culture—Human smooth muscle cells (AoSMC, CASMC), human endothelial cells (HAEC, HCAEC) from the aortic and coronary arteries, respectively, and human dermal microvascular endothelial cells, neonatal (HMVEC-d neo), were cultured according to the supplier (Clonetics, Charlotte, NC). Rat smooth muscle cells (RSMC) were a kind gift of Dr. Marco Bertulli (Bayer Research Laboratory, Milan, Italy). MEF-1 are wild-type murine embryonic fibroblasts derived from the same mouse strain as MEF-2. MEF-2 is genetically deficient in LRP (27Willnow T.E. Herz J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 719-726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RSMC, HT-1080 (highly invasive human fibrosarcoma cells), IF6 (non-invasive human melanoma cells that do not express uPA), MEF-1, and MEF-2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. Migration Assays—Chemotaxis assays were performed as previously described (28Degryse B. Resnati M. Rabbani S.A. Villa A. Fazioli F. Blasi F. Blood. 1999; 94: 649-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), using modified Boyden chambers. Briefly, ∼50,000 cells were added to the upper well of Boyden chambers, and the molecules to be tested were added to the lower well in serum-free medium. Antibodies or inhibitors were added to both wells. Haptotaxis assays were performed under the same conditions, except that the filters were washed with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and then preincubated with the indicated amounts of PAI-1 or fibronectin in the Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium solution for 3 h at 37 °C. The filters were washed, and then serum-free medium was added to both the upper and lower wells. Wounding assays were performed as previously described (29Degryse B. Bonaldi T. Scaffidi P. Muller S. Resnati M. Sanvito F. Arrigoni G. Bianchi M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent monolayers were scraped with a pipette tip, and the number of cells migrating into the wound over the next 24 h was then determined. Chemokinesis assays were performed as described (29Degryse B. Bonaldi T. Scaffidi P. Muller S. Resnati M. Sanvito F. Arrigoni G. Bianchi M.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), except that cells were stimulated for increasing times with 2 nm PAI-1 in the presence or absence of 5 μg/ml RAP, and were only labeled with phalloidin. The cells were then counted using an Olympus UplanFI 40 lens. Quantification of the actin cytoskeleton reorganization was performed by taking low magnification photographs and counting the resting cells (those that exhibit numerous stress fibers and a non-polarized morphology) and non-resting cells (polarized cell shape with reorganized actin cytoskeleton due to a decrease in stress fibers, and increased membrane ruffling and actin semi-rings). All experiments were performed at least twice in triplicate. Results are the mean ± S.E. of the number of cells counted in ten high power (×40) fields per filter and expressed as fold over control. Random cell migration (i.e. migration in the absence of chemoattractant) was given the arbitrary value of 100%. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were cultured, fixed, stained, and mounted as described (28Degryse B. Resnati M. Rabbani S.A. Villa A. Fazioli F. Blasi F. Blood. 1999; 94: 649-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that in some experiments, cells were pretreated for 5 min with RAP (5 μg/ml). Cells were stained either with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-Jak1, or anti-Stat1 antibody, and then were double-stained with phalloidin for visualization of filamentous actin. In some cases, the above cells were triple stained by employing the additional nucleus probe DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, Roche Applied Science). Fluorescence photographs were taken using an Olympus BX60 microscope coupled to a DVC camera using Olympus UplanFI 100 lens, and analyzed with C-view and Image pro-plus software. Surface Plasmon Resonance—Binding studies were performed by using the BIACORE®3000 biosensor system, and surface plasmon resonance analysis was done as described (20Neels J.G. van Den Berg B.M. Lookene A. Olivecrona G. Pannekoek H. van Zonneveld A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31305-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In these experiments, LRP was immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip at a density of 5.21 fmol/mm2, using the amine-coupling kit as instructed by the supplier. A control channel was activated and blocked in parallel, using the amine-coupling reagents in the absence of protein. Binding to the coated channel was corrected for binding to the non-coated control channel (less than 5% of the binding to coated channels). Surface plasmon resonance analysis was performed in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm Ca Cl2, 0.005% (v/v) Tween-20 at 25 °C with a flow rate of 5 μl/min. For qualitative measurements of the binding of the PAI-1 variants to immobilized LRP, 100 nm of each was injected in duplicate over the sensor chip surface. Different preparations of each variant were tested. BIA-evaluation software (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was used to analyze the resulting sensorgrams and to determine the association and dissociation rate constants (i.e. by performing nonlinear global fitting of data corrected for changes in bulk refractive index). Regeneration of the sensor chip surface was accomplished by incubating the chip with 100 mm H3PO4 for 2 min at a flow of 5 μl/min. Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Subsequently, cDNA was prepared from 0.3 μg of total RNA using random hexamers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a final reaction volume of 20 μl. Real-time PCR amplifications were performed from 2.5 μl of cDNA diluted 1:2 using LRP primers LRP-F (5′-TCAATGGGTGGATGTACTGGA-3′) and LRP-R (5′-AATCTTCCGGTCTGTGCCAT-3′) and β-actin primers β-actin-F (5′-TGGAATCCTGTGGCATCCATGAAAC-3′) and β-actin-R (5′-TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCCG-3′). These primer sets were employed at 150 nm in a final volume of 25 μl using the SYBR® Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). All PCR reactions were performed in an iCycler (Bio-Rad). Relative LRP mRNA levels were calculated after normalization to β-actin mRNA levels. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were incubated with 930 nm PAI-1 (or the PAI-1 variants) for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence or absence of RAP (6.7 μg/ml; 10 μm). The cells were lysed in 10 mm CHAPS in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and the resulting lysates were incubated for 18 h at 4 °C in the presence of both protein G-agarose beads and the IgG fraction of the monoclonal antibody against LRP (11H4) as described (13Czekay R.-P. Aertgeerts K. Curriden S.A. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The beads were washed, the proteins were extracted in reducing sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE using 7.5% acrylamide gel, and then analyzed by Western blotting (13Czekay R.-P. Aertgeerts K. Curriden S.A. Loskutoff D.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 781-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Briefly, the separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride Immulon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), the membranes were blocked by incubation in TBS, pH 7.2, 5% calf serum, 0.1% Tween-20 for 1 h, and then were incubated for 1 h with anti-PAI-1 or anti-LRP polyclonal antibodies. Blots were processed with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Pierce) using horseradish peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-rabbit (H+L) depleted of cross-reactivity to mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). PAI-1 migrated with an apparent Mr ∼43 kDa while LRP (β-chain) had an apparent Mr ∼85 kDa. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using Prism software. The Student's t test was employed for pair-wise comparisons of treatments, while an ANOVA model was used for the evaluation of treatments with increasing doses of a reagent. Experiments were performed to investigate the effects of PAI-1 on the migration of a variety of cells as determined using well known chemotaxis, haptotaxis, and wound-healing assays. In preliminary experiments, we examined the chemotactic effects of PAI-1 using Boyden chambers. Fig. 1A shows that PAI-1 stimulates the migration of normal RSMC in a dose-dependent manner, with a half-maximal response at 0.02-0.2 nm and a plateau at 2-20 nm. Similar data were obtained using invasive HT-1080 and non-invasive IF6 cells (data not shown). PAI-1 also increased the haptotactic activity of RSMC (Fig. 1B), and the rate of RSMC (Fig. 1C) and HT-1080 cell (not shown) migration into wounds, and did so at similar concentrations (compare Fig. 1, A-C). Experiments were performed to determine the specificity of the effects of PAI-1 on cell migration. The chemotactic effect of PAI-1, but not that of the well characterized attractant fMLP, was completely blocked by neutralizing polyclonal antibodies against PAI-1 (Fig. 1D). The migration-promoting effect of PAI-1 in wound healing assays was also inhibited by the addition of anti-PAI-1 antibodies (Fig. 1E). In both cases (Fig. 1, D and E), treatment with the antibody alone, or with nonspecific IgG gave results that did not differ significantly from the untreated control. Thus, these effects are specific for PAI-1 and not caused by contaminants in the PAI-1 preparation. PAI-1 binds to and inactivates uPA and tPA, and it binds to VN and blocks its ability to function as a cell adhesion molecule. In preliminary experiments (not shown), we were unable to block the chemotactic effects of PAI-1 using monoclonal antibodies that bind avidly to VN and block PAI-1 binding (30Seiffert D. Ciambrone G. Wagner N.V. Binder B.B. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2659-2666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, a PAI-1 mutant, which cannot bind to VN (i.e. PAI-1 Q123K) (31Lawrence D.A. Berkenpas M.B. Palaniappan S. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15223-15228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) stimulated RSMC migration (Fig. 2A) in a manner that was similar to that of PAI-1 itself (see Fig. 1A). Thus, the induction of cell migration by PAI-1 does not appear to depend on the binding of PAI-1 to VN. Experiments were performed to determine whether the chemotactic activity of PAI-1 depended on its interactions with uPA or tPA. In these experiments, several variant forms of PAI-1 were compared including those which have no inhibitory activity against uPA or tPA (i.e. PAI-1 T333R/A335R and PAI-1 R346M/M347S), those that do not bind to VN (i.e. PAI-1 Q123K), and an elastase cleaved form of PAI-1, which does not inhibit PAs and does not bind to VN. Unexpectedly, most of the PAI-1 variants, including the completely inactive cleaved form, were able to stimulate cell migration as well as PAI-1 itself, and as well as bFGF and fMLP (Fig. 2B). However, the double mutant, PAI-1 R346M/M347S, failed to stimulate cell migration (Fig. 2B) even when employed at very high concentrations (up to 4 μm) (not shown). Similar data were obtained using the wound-healing assay (Fig. 2C). The observation that cleaved PAI-1 retained full chemotactic activity suggests that PAI-1-mediated cell migration does not require active PAI-1. This conclusion is supported by the observation that an intact and highly purified (i.e. reversed-phase chromatography) form of PAI-1, which lacked detectable PA inhibitory activity and did not bind to VN, retained full chemotactic activity (not shown). Cell motility requires cytoskeleton reorganization and cell shape changes (32Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 585-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 33Degryse B. Orlando S. Resnati M. Rabbani S.A. Blasi F. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2032-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of PAI-1 on cellular morphology, subconfluent cultures of RSMC were stimulated for 30 min with PAI-1. Actin filaments were then labeled with FITC-phalloidin, and the distribution of phosphotyrosines (known to be associated with changes in the activation state of cellular signaling pathways) was visualized by immunofluorescence using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 3). In control cultures (top panels), phosphotyrosine staining was observed predominantly in the cytoplasm around but not over the nucleus, and most cells showed a high number of stress fibers revealing a well-developed actin cytoskeleton. Upon stimulation with PAI-1 (bottom panels), phosphotyrosines were now detected in the nucleus (arrow) and at the leading edge of the cell membrane (arrowheads). In addition, the cells developed a more polarized, elongated morphology reflecting the spatial rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. Membrane ruffling and an actin semi-ring structure were now observed at the leading edge of the cells. PAI-1 induced similar changes in HT-1080 cells (not shown). Chemokinesis experiments were performed to determine whether these changes in the morphology of PAI-1-treated cells represented a dynamic transition from the resting state t"
https://openalex.org/W2039816126,"The physiological responses of somatostatin are mediated by five different G protein-coupled receptors. Although agonist-induced endocytosis of the various somatostatin receptor subtypes (sst1-sst5) has been studied in detail, little is known about their postendocytic trafficking. Here we show that somatostatin receptors profoundly differ in patterns of β-arrestin mobilization and endosomal sorting. The β-arrestin-dependent trafficking of the sst2A somatostatin receptor resembled that of a class B receptor in that upon receptor activation, β-arrestin and the receptor formed stable complexes and internalized together into the same endocytic vesicles. This pattern was dependent on GRK2 (G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2)-mediated phosphorylation of a cluster of phosphate acceptor sites within the cytoplasmic tail of the sst2A receptor. Unlike other class B receptors, however, the sst2A receptor was rapidly resensitized and recycled to the plasma membrane. The β-arrestin mobilization of the sst3 and the sst5 somatostatin receptors resembled that of a class A receptor in that upon receptor activation, β-arrestin and the receptor formed relatively unstable complexes that dissociated at or near the plasma membrane. Consequently, β-arrestin was excluded from sst3-containing vesicles. Unlike other class A receptors, a large proportion of sst3 receptors was subject to ubiquitin-dependent lysosomal degradation and did not rapidly recycle to the plasma membrane. The sst4 somatostatin receptor is unique in that it did not exhibit agonist-dependent receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin recruitment. Together, these findings may provide important clues about the regulation of receptor responsiveness during long-term administration of somatostatin analogs.

Five genes encoding six different somatostatin receptor subtypes (sst1, sst2A, sst2B, sst3, sst4, sst5) have been cloned. These receptors are widely expressed in the central nervous system and periphery, and multiple somatostatin receptor subtypes often coexist in the same cell (1Patel Y.C. Front.

Moreover, it has allowed the development of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy for tumor imaging as well as somatostatin receptor-targeted radiotherapy (9Lamberts S.W. Krenning E.P. Reubi J.C. Endocr. Rev. 1991; 12: 450-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 10Forster G.J. Engelbach M.J. Brockmann J.J. Reber H.J. Buchholz H.G. Macke H.R. Rosch F.R. Herzog H.R. Bartenstein P.R. Eur. J. Nucl. Med. 2001; 28: 1743-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The fact that naturally occurring somatostatin peptides have only short half-lives has necessitated the development of stable somatostatin peptide analogs including octreotide and lanreotide. Although SS-14 binds with high affinity to all five somatostatin receptors, octreotide and lanreotide bind only to sst2 with high affinity and to sst3 and sst5 with moderate affinity (1Patel Y.C. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 157-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar, 11Culler M.D. Taylor J.E. Moreau J.P. Ann. Endocrinol. (Paris). 2002; 63: 2S5-212PubMed Google Scholar). It is well known that the physiological responses to SS-14 are diminished with continued exposure (1Patel Y.C. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 1999; 20: 157-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). However, important differences have been observed in the response of neuroendocrine tumors to the long-term application of stable somatostatin analogs. In patients harboring somatostatin receptor-expressing growth hormone-secreting adenoma, the inhibitory effects of somatostatin analogs on hormone secretion persist for many years during long-term treatment, and only few thyrotropin-secreting tumors escape from octreotide therapy. In contrast, islet cell tumors and carcinoids are very likely to undergo desensitization within weeks to months of octreotide exposure (12Hofland L.J. Lamberts S.W. Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 28-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Although studies in transfected host cells have examined agonist-induced internalization of the various somatostatin receptor subtypes (2Csaba Z. Dournaud P. Neuropeptides. 2001; 35: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), the molecular basis for the distinct long-term responsiveness of individual target cells has not been established. So far only species-related differences in agonist-mediated endocytosis of somatostatin receptors have been observed, e.g. the rat sst4 receptor appears to be largely resistant to agonist-induced internalization and desensitization (13Kreienkamp H.J. Roth A. Richter D. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whereas the human sst4 receptor has been reported to undergo a very slow but clearly detectable endocytosis. Other studies have shown that the human sst1 receptor but not the rat sst1 receptor failed to internalize in an agonist-dependent manner (14Hukovic N. Rocheville M. Kumar U. Sasi R. Khare S. Patel Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24550-24558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Roth A. Kreienkamp H.J. Nehring R.B. Roosterman D. Meyerhof W. Richter D. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to characterize early molecular events after agonist activation that lead to functional desensitization and sequestration of the distinct somatostatin receptor subtypes. Moreover, we wanted to delineate the molecular determinants that dictate the differential trafficking and endosomal sorting of somatostatin receptors. All five somatostatin receptors belong to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). After agonist binding and activation of GPCRs, the signaling is turned off by phosphorylation of intracellular receptor domains and subsequent recruitment of cytoplasmic proteins termed arrestins that interrupt coupling between the receptor and its cognate heterotrimeric G protein (16Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 17Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19452-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). β-Arrestins also function as docking proteins that link the receptor to components of the endocytic machinery such as AP-2 and clathrin and as scaffolding proteins to turn on signaling to mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades (18Pierce K.L. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1532-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Within the endosomal compartment, β-arrestins regulate the rate at which internalized receptors are dephosphorylated and recycled to the plasma membrane (19Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 20Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14498-14506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Based on their binding properties to different isoforms of β-arrestin, GPCRs have been categorized into two classes. Class A receptors (e.g. μ-opioid, β2 and α1B adrenergic, endothelin A, and dopamine D1A receptors) do not bind visual arrestin and have a higher affinity for nonvisual β-arrestin-2 than β-arrestin-1. Class B receptors (e.g. substance P, angiotensin AT1a, neurotensin 1, and vasopressin 2 receptors) bind visual arrestin and have similar affinities for β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2 (16Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). Class A and class B receptors also differ in the fate of the β-arrestin-receptor complex. For class A receptors, β-arrestin directs the receptors to clathrin-coated pits but does not internalize with them. For class B receptors, β-arrestin forms stable complexes with the receptors, such that the receptor-β-arrestin complex internalizes as a unit into early endosomes (17Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19452-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Here we identify the sst3 and sst5 somatostatin receptors as class A receptors and the sst2A somatostatin receptor as class B receptor. The trafficking of the sst1 and sst4 somatostatin receptors did not appear to depend on β-arrestins. We demonstrate that the formation of stable complexes between β-arrestin and sst2A requires G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2)-mediated phosphorylation of a cluster of phosphate acceptor sites within the cytoplasmic tail of the sst2A receptor. We also show that sst2A and sst3 underwent differential endosomal sorting. In contrast to what would be expected from their β-arrestin mobilization patterns, the sst2A receptor was rapidly recycled to the plasma membrane whereas the sst3 receptor was subject to ubiquitination-dependent lysosomal degradation. Materials—Monoclonal mouse anti-ubiquitin antibody (UbP4D1) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal anti-T7 antibody and mouse monoclonal anti-T7 antibody covalently coupled to Sepharose beads were obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI). The rabbit anti-sst2A antibody was generated to the peptide ETQRTLLNGDLQTSI, which corresponds to residues 355-369 of the carboxyl-terminal tail of rat/mouse/human sst2A. The anti-sst3 antibody was generated to the peptide TAGDKASTLSHL, which corresponds to residues 417-428 of the carboxyl-terminal tail of the rat/mouse sst3. Both antibodies have been characterized extensively (21Pfeiffer M. Koch T. Schroder H. Klutzny M. Kirscht S. Kreienkamp H.J. Hollt V. Schulz S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14027-14036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). All polyclonal rabbit antisera were purified by affinity chromatography using the Sulfo-Link coupling gel coupled to the appropriate immunizing peptide according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Pierce). Plasmid constructs of the rat sst1, sst2A, sst3, sst4, and sst5 containing the amino-terminal T7 epitope tag sequence MASMTGGQQMG in pcDNA3 have been described previously (13Kreienkamp H.J. Roth A. Richter D. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Roth A. Kreienkamp H.J. Nehring R.B. Roosterman D. Meyerhof W. Richter D.

Truncated sst2A mutants were created by PCR using primers that introduce stop codons at suitable positions (22Schwartkop C.P. Kreienkamp H.J. Richter D. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Point mutations were introduced into sst2A by PCR replacing threonine 353, 355, and 356 with alanine. The sequences of all constructs were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The plasmid encoding β-arrestin-1-enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) was kindly provided by N. W. Bunnett (University of California, San Francisco). The construct encoding the β-arrestin-2-EGFP fusion protein was obtained from Biosignal (Montreal, Canada). Transferrin-Alexa Fluor 488 was purchased from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Stable transfectants were selected in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). HEK 293 cells stably expressing the T7-tagged sst2A (Bmax, 820 ± 19 fmol/mg membrane protein) or T7-tagged sst3 receptors (Bmax, 1,182 ± 31 fmol/mg membrane protein) were characterized using radioligand binding assays, Western blot analysis, and immunocytochemistry as described previously (21Pfeiffer M. Koch T. Schroder H. Klutzny M. Kirscht S. Kreienkamp H.J. Hollt V. Schulz S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14027-14036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The level of somatostatin receptor expression was between 1,500 and 2,000 fmol/mg membrane protein for all experiments using transiently transfected HEK 293 cells. Confocal Microscopy—One day after transfection, cells were seeded into 35-mm glass-bottom culture dishes (Mattek, Ashland, MA). The next day, cells were incubated for 2 h in serum-free OPTIMEM-1 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). Cells were then transferred onto a temperature-controlled microscope stage set at 37 °C. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Leica TCS NT laser scanning confocal microscope (Heidelberg, Germany). Analysis of β-arrestin translocation was performed in cells transiently cotransfected with 1.5 μg of either β-arrestin-1-EGFP or β-arrestin-2-EGFP and 6 μg of the various somatostatin receptor subtypes. When indicated, 4 μg of GRK2 or 4 μg of empty vector (MOCK) were included in the transfections. Images were collected sequentially using single line excitation at 488 nm with 515-540-nm band pass emission filters. Saturating concentrations of SS-14 (1 μm) were applied directly into the culture medium immediately after the initial image was taken. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips overnight. After the appropriate treatment with SS-14, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% picric acid in phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) for 40 min at room temperature and washed several times in TPBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm phosphate buffer, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.05% thimerosal). Specimens were then incubated for 3 min in 50% methanol and 3 min in 100% methanol, washed in TPBS, and preincubated with TPBS supplemented with 3% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated with affinity-purified anti-T7, anti-sst2A, or anti-sst3 antibodies at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in TPBS supplemented with 1% normal goat serum overnight. After washing with TPBS, bound primary antibody was detected with cyanine 3.18-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Cells were then dehydrated, cleared in xylol, and permanently mounted in DPX (Fluka, Deisenhofen, Germany). For β-arrestin-2-EGFP/sst2A colocalization studies, cells were mounted directly in Vectashield Hard Set mounting medium (Vector, Burlingame, CA). Specimens were examined using a Leica TCS NT laser scanning microscope. Cyanine 3.18 was imaged with 568 nm excitation and 570-630-nm band pass emission filters. Transferrin Trafficking—A previously described pulse-chase assay was used to estimate the degree to which a “pulse” of internalized sst2A or sst3 was accessible to a subsequent “chase” of endocytosed transferrin (23Tsao P.I. Von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells stably expressing T7-tagged sst2A or sst3 were grown on glass coverslips, and receptors were surface-labeled with 1 μg/ml T7 antibody. In the first set of experiments, cells were simultaneously incubated with 1 μm SS-14 and 5 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated transferrin for 30 min at 37 °C. In a second set of experiments, cells were first incubated with 1 μm SS-14 for 30 min at 37 °C to drive endocytosis of antibody-labeled receptors. Next, cells were chilled on ice, rinsed with EDTA-supplemented phosphate-buffered saline, rewarmed for 20 min in medium lacking agonist but containing 5 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated transferrin. Cells were fixed and permeabilized, and antibody-labeled sst2A or sst3 receptors were detected using cyanine 3.18-conjugated secondary antibodies. Specimens were examined as described above. Whole Cell Phosphorylation Assay—HEK 293 cells were plated at a density of 106 cells/dish onto 100-mm dishes. The next day, cells were transfected with the appropriate plasmids. Two days later, cells were washed with serum- and phosphate-free medium and then labeled with 200 μCi/ml carrier-free 32P-orthophosphate (285 Ci/mg Pi, ICN, Eschwege, Germany) for 60 min at 37 °C. Labeled cells were then exposed to 1 μm SS-14 for 20 min. Subsequently, cells were placed on ice and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then scraped into 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm disodium pyrophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml bacitracin). Cells were solubilized on a rotating platform for 60 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 60 min at 4 °C, receptor proteins were immunoprecipitated using T7 affinity beads. Receptors were eluted from the beads using SDS-sample buffer for 20 min at 60 °C. The samples were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The extent of receptor phosphorylation was quantitated using a Fuji phosphoimaging system and BAS 1000 software. Loading of equal amounts of receptor proteins in each lane was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Receptor phosphorylation was expressed as a percent of wild-type sst2A. Means ± S.E. of three independent experiments are reported. Western Blot Analysis—Stably transfected HEK 293 cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated 100-mm dishes and grown to 80% confluence. After treatment with SS-14 in serum-free medium, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer as described above. Glycosylated proteins were partially enriched using wheat germ-lectin-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were eluted from the beads using SDS-sample buffer for 20 min at 60 °C and then resolved on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electroblotting, the membranes were incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-sst2A or anti-sst3 antibody for 12 h at 4 °C followed by detection using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). For ubiquitination studies, 200 μm chloroquine (Sigma) and 25 μm MG132 (Calbiochem) were added to the culture medium 30 min before and during agonist treatment. Cells were then lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 200 μm chloroquine, 25 μm MG132, and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Calbiochem). Receptor proteins were precipitated with T7 affinity beads. Ubiquitinated receptors were detected using anti-ubiquitin antibodies (2 μg/ml). NIH Image 1.62 software was used to desensitize and quantify protein bands detected on Western blots. Statistical analysis was carried out with the Student's t test using GraphPad Prism 3.0 software. p-values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Differential β-Arrestin Mobilization of Somatostatin Receptors—We employed functional β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2 conjugated to enhanced green fluorescent protein to visualize the translocation of β-arrestins to the plasma membrane in live HEK 293 cells transfected with distinct somatostatin receptor subtypes. In the absence of the agonist, both β-arrestin-EGFP isoforms were uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the cells (Fig. 1, 0 min). β-Arrestin-1 was also detectable inside the cell nucleus. The addition of saturating concentrations of SS-14 induced a rapid redistribution of β-arrestin-1 as well as β-arrestin-2 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in sst2A- and sst3-transfected cells. In sst3-expressing cells, fluorescence outlining the shape of the cells was less marked in cells cotransfected with β-arrestin-1 as compared with cells cotransfected with β-arrestin-2. In sst5-transfected cells, only translocation of β-arrestin-2 but not β-arrestin-1 was observed. Translocation of β-arrestin-1 or β-arrestin-2 to the plasma membrane was not detectable in cells transfected with either sst1 or sst4. After extended agonist exposure, internalization of β-arrestin-EGFP into endocytotic vesicles was observed only in sst2A-expressing cells (Fig. 1, 50 min). Dual color confocal microscopy revealed that β-arrestin-2-EGFP and sst2A were extensively colocalized in early endosomes (Fig. 2). In both sst3- and sst5-expressing cells, β-arrestin-EGFP ultimately redistributed to the cytoplasm after prolonged SS-14 exposure (Fig. 1, 50 min).Fig. 2Cotrafficking of β-arrestin and sst2A into early endosomes. HEK 293 cells-expressing sst2A were transiently transfected with 1.5 μgof β-arrestin-2-EGFP and 4 μg of GRK2. Cells were exposed to SS-14 for 0, 1, or 30 min. Cells were then fixed, processed for dual immunofluorescence, and examined by confocal microscopy. Receptor expression level was ∼800 fmol/mg membrane protein.

Scale bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Agonist-induced Receptor Phosphorylation and β-Arrestin Trafficking—Formation of stable complexes between β-arrestin and GPCRs strongly depends on the presence of clusters of phosphate acceptor sites (defined as serine/threonine residues occupying three consecutive positions or three of four positions) within the carboxyl-terminal tail of the receptor (16Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17201-17210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 17Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19452-19460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). These clusters are remarkably conserved in their position within the carboxyl-terminal domain and serve as primary sites of agonist-dependent receptor phosphorylation. The carboxyl-terminal tails of the sst2A, sst3, and sst4 receptors contain such clusters of phosphate acceptor sites; however, they occupy different positions with regard to the conserved NPILY motif, which marks the end of the seventh transmembrane domain and the beginning of the cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 3A). To delineate a mechanistic basis for the observed differences in the trafficking patterns of these three receptors, we assessed whole cell receptor phosphorylation and β-arrestin-dependent trafficking in the presence and absence of GRK2. Overexpression of GRK2 promoted a marked increase in SS-14-dependent phosphorylation of the sst2A receptor (Fig. 3C, left panel) and facilitated the recruitment of β-arrestin-2 to the plasma membrane as well as its trafficking with the receptor into the endocytotic vesicles (Fig. 3B, upper panel), indicating that these processes strongly depend on the cellular complement of GRK2. In sst3-expressing cells, agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 3C, middle panel) and β-arrestin-2 trafficking (Fig. 3B, lower panel) were largely independent of the presence of overexpressed GRK2. Although the sst4 receptor contains several putative phosphorylation sites in its cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 3A), we were not able to detect any agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 3C, right panel) or β-arrestin-2 mobilization (not shown) in the presence or absence of GRK2. Molecular Determinants Underlying the Cotrafficking of β-Arrestin and sst2A into Endocytotic Vesicles—To determine the sites required for GRK2-mediated phosphorylation and β-arrestin mobilization of the sst2A receptor, serial truncations were constructed deleting either 10 (359X), 15 (354X), or 20 (349X) amino acids of its carboxyl-terminal tail (Fig. 4A). As depicted in Fig. 4, B and C, deletion of 10 amino acids of the sst2A receptor tail (359X mutant), which contain serine-368 and threonine-367 as potential phosphorylation sites, reduced GRK2-mediated phosphorylation by ∼10% (residual phosphorylation, 89% ± 4%; n = 3) (Fig. 4C). Analysis of β-arrestin mobilization of the 359X mutant revealed that the receptor is still phosphorylated sufficiently enough to induce a translocation of β-arrestin-2-EGFP to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B). However, analysis of the 359X receptor also showed that phosphorylation of serine 368 and/or threonine 367 is required for formation of stable β-arrestin-sst2A complexes (Fig. 4B). Deletion of 15 amino acids of the sst2A receptor tail (354X mutant), which contain two more potential phosphorylation sites, namely threonine 359 and threonine 356, reduced GRK2-mediated phosphorylation by ∼40% (residual phosphorylation, 62% ± 14%; n = 3) (Fig. 4C). Analysis of β-arrestin trafficking of the 356X mutant revealed that the residual receptor phosphorylation was not sufficient to induce translocation of β-arrestin-2-EGFP to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B). Deletion of 20 amino acids of the sst2A receptor tail (349X mutant), which contain two additional potential phosphorylation sites, namely threonine 354 and threonine 353, strongly reduced GRK2-mediated phosphorylation (residual phosphorylation, 19% ± 4%; n = 3) and β-arrestin binding (Fig. 4, B and C). In the AAEA mutant, the cluster of threonine 353, 355, and 356 was replaced by alanine residues. The level of agonist-induced phosphorylation was reduced by 55% as compared with the wild-type sst2A (residual phosphorylation, 44% ± 2%; n = 3) (Fig. 4C). In cells expressing the AAEA mutant, agonist-induced β-arrestin-2 translocation was strongly inhibited, and fluorescence outlining the cell shape was hardly detectable. Immunocytochemical staining of nonpermeabilized cells using anti-T7 antibodies revealed that all sst2A mutants were targeted to the plasma membrane (not shown). These data suggest that many if not all of the potential phosphate acceptor sites contained within the 20 carboxyl-terminal amino acids are involved in GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of the sst2A receptor and that phosphorylation of these sites is required for formation of stable β-arrestin-sst2A complexes. These data also suggest that the cluster of threonine 353, 355, and 356 may represent the primary site for GRK2-mediated phosphorylation and β-arrestin binding.

https://openalex.org/W2153784333,"Human visual recognition processes are remarkably robust and can function effectively even under highly degraded viewing conditions. Contextual information may play a critical role in such circumstances. Here, we provide neurophysiological evidence that contextual cues can elicit object-specific neural responses, which have hitherto been believed to be based on intrinsic cues alone. Specifically, we find that the ""fusiform face area"" (FFA) maintains its selectivity for faces without regard to whether the faces are defined intrinsically or contextually. This finding further elucidates the role of the FFA and reveals neural correlates of contextual processing in the service of robust object recognition."

Mouse gene knock-out studies suggest that TRAFs are involved in a broad range of biological functions, such as adaptive and innate immunity, embryonic development, stress response, and bone metabolism (1Wajant H.

In Drosophila, TRAFs are essential for toll-like receptor-mediated dorsoventral polarization and innate host defense (1Wajant H. Henkler F. Scheurich P. Cell.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6482-6491Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). The prototypic members of the TRAF family are TRAF1 and TRAF2, which were identified as signal transducers associated with TNF receptors (4Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V.

The TRAF proteins are characterized by the presence of a conserved C-terminal coiled-coil domain, the TRAF domain. It has been shown that the TRAF domain is involved in homo- or heterodimerization and interaction with their cognate receptors or cytoplasmic signaling proteins (1Wajant H. Henkler F. Scheurich P. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 2Chung J.Y. Park Y.C. Ye H. Wu H. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 679-688Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6482-6491Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Except for TRAF1, TRAFs also contain a conserved RING finger domain and several adjacent zinc finger domains at their N termini. Various studies have demonstrated that the RING finger domains of some TRAF proteins, such as TRAF2 and TRAF6, have E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which is required for their activation of downstream MAP3K family kinases such as MEKK1–3, NIK, ASK1, and (7Yuasa T.

In a search for novel proteins containing TRAF-like RING finger domain, we identified a protein designated as TRAF7. TRAF7 contains a N-terminal RING finger domain and an adjacent zinc finger domain, which are mostly homologous with those of TRAF family members. The C terminus of TRAF7 contains seven WD40 repeats. Our findings suggest that TRAF7 specifically interacts with MEKK3 and potentiates MEKK3-induced AP1 and CHOP (C/EBP-homologous protein) activation and induces apoptosis through caspase-dependent pathways. Reagents—Monoclonal antibodies against FLAG and HA epitopes and β-tubulin (Sigma) and the caspase inhibitor BD-fmk (Enzyme Systems) were purchased from the indicated manufactures. Constructs—CHOP luciferase reporter system was purchased from Stratagene. AP1-luciferase reporter construct and mammalian expression plasmid for MEKK1 (Dr. Gary Johnson), and mammalian expression plasmids for FLAG-tagged RIP and NIK (Dr. David Goeddel) were provided by the indicated investigators. Mammalian expression plasmids for FLAG-tagged human MEKK2 and MEKK3 and HA-tagged human TRAF7 and its mutants were constructed by PCR amplification of the corresponding cDNA fragments and subsequently cloning into a CMV promoter-based vector containing an N-terminal HA or FLAG tag. Northern Blot Hybridization—Human multiple tissue mRNA blot was purchased from Clontech. The blot was hybridized with [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe corresponding to human TRAF7 coding sequence. Hybridization was performed in the Rapid Hybridization Buffer (Clontech) under high stringency conditions. Co-immunoprecipitation, in Vitro Kinase Assays, and Western Blot Analysis—These experiments were performed as previously described (14Han K.J. Su X. Xu L.G. Bin L.H. Zhang J. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. January 22, 2004; (10.1074/jbc.M311629200)Google Scholar). Cell Transfection and Reporter Gene Assays—Transfection of 293 cells and reporter gene assays were performed as described (14Han K.J. Su X. Xu L.G. Bin L.H. Zhang J. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. January 22, 2004; (10.1074/jbc.M311629200)Google Scholar). Within the same experiment, each transfection was performed in triplicate, and where necessary, empty control plasmid was added to ensure that each transfection receives the same amount of total DNA. To normalize for transfection efficiency, 0.2 μg of RSV-β-galactosidase luciferase reporter plasmid was added to each transfection. Luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of β-galactosidase activities. Data shown were averages from one representative experiment. The standard deviations were less than 10% of the average values for all samples. Cell Death and DNA Fragmentation Assays—β-Galactosidase cotransfection assays for determination of cell death and DNA fragmentation assays were performed as described previously (5Hsu H. Shu H.B. Pan M.G. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1996; 84: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar, 14Han K.J. Su X. Xu L.G. Bin L.H. Zhang J. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. January 22, 2004; (10.1074/jbc.M311629200)Google Scholar). Identification of TRAF7—We searched the GenBank™ expressed sequence tag data bases for proteins containing a TRAF-like RING finger domain. This search identified a novel protein designated as TRAF7. TRAF7 has two alternative splice forms. The longer form encodes a 670-amino acid protein (Fig. 1A). The shorter form encodes a protein lacking the first 66 amino acids of the longer form. The long form is referred as TRAF7, while the short form is referred as TRAF7s. TRAF7 contains a RING finger domain at aa 125–160 and an adjacent zinc finger domain at aa 221–287 (Fig. 1A). Blast searches of the GenBank™ data bases indicate that the RING and zinc finger domains of TRAF7 are mostly conserved with those of TRAF proteins. The C terminus of TRAF7 contains seven WD40 repeats, which are mostly conserved with β-transducin-like protein Het-e and Het-d, F-box, and WD40 domain-containing proteins FBXW6, FBXW7, and FBX30 (Fig. 1A). TRAF7 is an evolutionarily highly conserved protein. Human TRAF7 shares ∼97 and 92% sequence identity with its orthologs in mouse and Xenopus respectively (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Tissue Distribution of TRAF7—To examine tissue distribution of TRAF7 expression, we performed Northern blot analysis. The results suggest that human TRAF7 mRNA is expressed in all examined tissues as two transcripts of ∼2.6 and ∼4.0 kb, respectively (Fig. 1B). Expression of TRAF7 is relatively higher in skeletal muscle, heart, colon, spleen, kidney, liver, and placenta than in brain, thymus, small intestine, lung, and peripheral blood leukocytes (Fig. 1B). TRAF7 Interacts with MEKK3—Previously, it has been shown that the RING finger domains of TRAF proteins are critically involved in activation of MAP3K family members involved in NF-κB and JNK activation and apoptosis (7Yuasa T.

Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). Since TRAF7 contains a TRAF-like RING finger domain, we determined whether TRAF7 can physically and functionally interact with MAP3K family members. We transfected 293 cells with expression plasmids for HA-tagged TRAF7 and FLAG-tagged MEKK2, MEKK3, NIK, and RIP and performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The results indicated that TRAF7 interacted with MEKK3 but not with MEKK2, NIK, and RIP (Fig. 2A). In a separate experiment, fLAG-tagged TRAF7 did not interact with HA-tagged MEKK1 (data not shown). These data suggest that TRAF7 specifically interacts with MEKK3. Since TRAF7 contains several conserved domains, we determined which domain is responsible for the interaction of TRAF7 with MEKK3. To do this, we constructed four deletion mutants, including TRAF7-(1–419), TRAF-(77–670), TRAF7-(162–670), and TRAF7-(293–670). Transient transfection and co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that the C-terminal WD40 repeats (aa 293–670) were required and sufficient for the interaction of TRAF7 with MEKK3 (Fig. 2B). TRAF7 Potentiates the Kinase Activity of MEKK3—Since TRAF7 interacts with MEKK3, we determined whether TRAF7 has any effects on the kinase activity of MEKK3. We transfected 293 cells with expression plasmids for HA-TRAF7 and FLAG-MEKK3, FLAG-MEKK2, or FLAG-RIP. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to in vitro kinase assays. The results indicated that TRAF7 increased the autophosphorylation of MEKK3 (Fig. 2C). In these experiments, TRAF7 did not have significant effects on autophosphorylation of MEKK2 and RIP (Fig. 2C). TRAF7 also did not affect kinase activity of MEKK1 and NIK (data not shown). These data suggest that TRAF7 specifically promotes the kinase activity of MEKK3. TRAF7 Potentiates MEKK3-induced AP1 and CHOP Activation—Previously, it has been shown that MEKK3 activates JNK and p38 kinase pathways, which lead to activation of two transcription factors, AP1 and CHOP, respectively (15Ellinger-Ziegelbauer H. Brown K. Kelly K. Siebenlist U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2668-2674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Deacon K. Blank J.L. J. Biol.

We determined the effect of TRAF7 on MEKK3-induced AP1 and CHOP activation by reporter gene assays. The results indicated that TRAF7 itself had no effects on AP1 activation. However, TRAF7 could potentiate MEKK3-induced AP1 activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Overexpression of TRAF7 could weakly activate CHOP by itself and potentiate MEKK3-induced CHOP activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). In these experiments, TRAF7 had no significant effects on MEKK1-mediated AP1 and CHOP activation (data not shown). We also analyzed which domain of TRAF7 is responsible for its potentiation of MEKK3-induced AP1 and CHOP activation. The results indicated that the WD40 repeats were essential for TRAF7 potentiation of both MEKK3-induced AP1 and CHOP activation (Fig. 3, C and D). Depletion of TRAF7 by Antisense RNA Inhibits MEKK3-induced AP1 and CHOP Activation—To determine whether TRAF7 plays a physiological role in MEKK3 signaling, we determined the effects of depletion of TRAF7 on MEKK3-induced AP1 and CHOP activation. As shown in Fig. 3E, transfection of antisense TRAF7 construct inhibited expression of TRAF7. In reporter gene assays, this antisense construct significantly inhibited MEKK3-induced AP1 and CHOP activation (Fig. 3, F and G). TRAF7 antisense RNA did not inhibit MEKK1-induced AP1 activation (Fig. 3F) but inhibited MEKK1-induced CHOP activation (Fig. 3G). TRAF7 Induces Apoptosis through Caspase-dependent Pathways—In our transient transfection experiments, we found that overexpression of TRAF7 caused cellular condensation, roundup, and detachment from the dish, characteristics of apoptotic cells (Fig. 4A). Deletion of the RING finger domain of TRAF7 significantly reduced its ability to induce cell death, suggesting that the RING finger domain of TRAF7 is important for its apoptotic activity (Fig. 4A). TRAF7-induced apoptosis is significantly inhibited by the caspase inhibitor crmA (Fig. 4A). Overexpression of TRAF7 also induced DNA fragmentation and this was inhibited by crmA, confirming that TRAF7 induces caspase-dependent apoptosis (Fig. 4B). In these experiments, overexpression of MEKK3 caused weaker apoptotic effects (Fig. 4, A and B). In our experiments, a major fraction of overexpressed N-terminal tagged TRAF7 was identified in high molecular weight complexes or was processed into smaller fragments, with a major processed fragment of ∼45 kDa (Figs. 2A and 3E). TRAF7 mutants were also accumulated in high molecular weight complexes or processed into fragments (Fig. 2B). Overexpression of independently cloned, C-terminal FLAG-tagged TRAF7 also led to similar patterns (data not shown). The processing of TRAF7 is not mediated by caspases because crmA or the pan-caspase inhibitor BD-fmk could not inhibit the processing. Moreover, mutation of the potential caspase cleavage sites, including Asp341, Asp350, Asp357, and Asp363, had no effects on the processing of TRAF7 (data not shown). During the preparation of this manuscript for publication, an independent study also identified TRAF7 (21Bouwmeester T. Bauch A. Ruffner H. Angrand P.O. Bergamini G. Croughton K. Cruciat C. Eberhard D. Gagneur J. Ghidelli S. Hopf C. Huhse B. Mangano R. Michon A.M. Schirle M. Schlegl J. Schwab M. Stein M.A. Bauer A. Casari G. Drewes G. Gavin A.C. Jackson D.B. Joberty G. Neubauer G.

In a large scale experiment to map an interaction network of signaling proteins of the TNF and NF-κB activation pathways, TRAF7 was identified as a protein interacting with MEKK3 and potentiating MEKK3-induced NF-κB and AP1 activation. This study also demonstrated that TRAF7 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase capable of self-ubiquitination (21Bouwmeester T. Bauch A. Ruffner H. Angrand P.O. Bergamini G. Croughton K. Cruciat C. Eberhard D. Gagneur J. Ghidelli S. Hopf C. Huhse B. Mangano R. Michon A.M. Schirle M. Schlegl J. Schwab M. Stein M.A. Bauer A. Casari G. Drewes G. Gavin A.C. Jackson D.B. Joberty G. Neubauer G. Rick J. Kuster B. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). This study points to the possibility that the high molecular weight complexes observed in our study represent ubiquitinated TRAF7 and ubiquitination of TRAF7 leads to its limited processing. Our studies suggest that TRAF7 contains two important domains. Its WD40 repeats are sufficient for potentiating MEKK3-mediated AP1 and CHOP activation, suggesting that the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF7 is not required for its potentiation of MEKK3-mediated AP1 and CHOP activation. In contrast, the RING finger domain of TRAF7 is important for its apoptotic activity. The mechanisms responsible for TRAF7-mediated cellular effects and the upstream components to which TRAF7 links MEKK3 need to be further investigated."

Characterization of this strain showed that the synthesis of mature sulfolipid SL-1 was interrupted and that a more polar sulfated molecule, termed SL-N, accumulated within the cell. Purification of SL-N and structural analysis identified this molecule as a family of 2,3-diacyl-α,α′-d-trehalose-2′-sulfates. This structure suggests that transport and biogenesis of SL-1 are coupled and that the final step in sulfatide biosynthesis may be the extra-cellular esterification of two trehalose 6-positions with hydroxyphthioceranic acids. To assess the effect of the loss of this anionic surface lipid on virulence, we infected mice via aerosol with the MmpL8 mutant and found that, although initial replication rates and containment levels were identical, compared with the wild type, a significant attenuation of the MmpL8 mutant strain in time-to-death was observed. Early in infection, differential expression of cytokines and cytokine receptors revealed that the mutant strain less efficiently suppresses key indicators of a Th1-type immune response, suggesting an immunomodulatory role for sulfatides in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis.

Despite more than 100 years of research, tuberculosis continues to be a serious global health problem, and the bacterial factors that facilitate the intracellular survival and pathogenesis of this disease remain largely unknown. The unique mycobacterial envelope, rich in diverse biologically active lipids, not only provides a physical barrier from environmental factors and host damage but also presents multiple lipid species that can contribute directly to the pathology of mycobacterial disease (1Daffe M.

These proteins are characterized by the presence of 12 transmembrane domains and two extracytoplasmic loops and have been reported in the genomes of organisms from all major kingdoms of life. In Gram-negative bacteria, these proteins facilitate the transport of a large variety of drugs, heavy metals, aliphatic and aromatic solvents, bile salts, fatty acids, detergents, and dyes (5Tseng T.T.

In this case, both synthesis and transport of this complex polyketide were affected. The co-localization of some of the mmpL genes with genes involved in polyketide biosynthesis (pks genes) and genes involved in lipid metabolism (papA and fadD) suggests a similar role of these proteins in complex lipid transport in MTb (7Tekaia F.

The low abundance of this molecule in cultured MTb, its unique presence in the pathogenic human tubercle bacillus, and numerous experimental studies over the past 40 years strongly suggest a role for SL-1 in virulence. Some studies have reported a significant correlation between virulence of different strains of M. tuberculosis in guinea pigs and the amount of SL-1 produced by these strains cultured in vitro (15Goren M.B. Brokl O. Schaefer W.B. Infect. Immun. 1974; 9: 142-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gangadharam P.R. Cohn M.L. Middlebrook G. Tubercle. 1963; 44: 452-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Administration of M. tuberculosis sulfatides to cultured macrophages prevents phagosome-lysosome fusion (14Goren M.B. D'Arcy Hart P. Young M.R. Armstrong J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2510-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), although this effect has been questioned since many anionic lipids could interact similarly with cationic sites on lysosomal hydrolases with resultant immobilization and/or inactivation of the enzymes (15Goren M.B. Brokl O. Schaefer W.B. Infect. Immun. 1974; 9: 142-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A role for SL-1 in blocking human macrophage and neutrophil activation by modulation of superoxide release and secretion of IL-1β and TNF-α also has been observed (17Zhang L. English D. Andersen B.R. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 2730-2736PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zhang L. Gay J.C. English D. Andersen B.R. J. Biomed. Sci. 1994; 1: 253-262PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zhang L. Goren M.B. Holzer T.J.

Horan M. Rademacher J.M. Pabst K.M. Pabst M.J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 2542-2548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in vivo and in vitro studies have shown that SL-1 and cord factor may synergize in terms of mouse toxicity and attack on mitochondrial structure and function (22Kato M. Goren M.B. Infect. Immun. 1974; 10: 733-741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to these studies, two different groups (23Converse S.E. Mougous J.D. Leavell M.D. Leary J.A. Bertozzi C.R. Cox J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6121-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 24Rousseau C. Turner O.C. Rush E. Bordat Y. Sirakova T.D. Kolattukudy P.E. Ritter S. Orme I.M. Gicquel B. Jackson M. Infect.

(23Converse S.E. Mougous J.D. Leavell M.D. Leary J.A. Bertozzi C.R. Cox J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6121-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) that the synthesis of SL-1 is interrupted in an MTb mmpL8 mutant. This mutant accumulates a more polar molecule, termed SL-N, which is a likely precursor of SL-1. As a consequence, the cell surface charge appears to have been significantly altered. Purification and extensive analytical characterization of SL-N lead us to propose that, in contrast with the structure suggested by Converse et al. (23Converse S.E. Mougous J.D. Leavell M.D. Leary J.A. Bertozzi C.R. Cox J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6121-6126Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), this molecule is a family of 2,3-diacyl-α,α′-d-trehalose-2′-sulfates. Finally, we show that although loss of the MmpL8 protein does not affect in vivo replication rate or bacterial numbers during chronic infection, it does attenuate virulence of MTb in murine survival studies.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains, Culture Conditions, and Plasmids—The Electro-MAX DH5α Escherichia coli strain (Invitrogen) used for cloning was grown in Luria-Bertani medium with hygromycin (200 μg/ml) (Invitrogen) or gentamicin (Invitrogen) (5 μg/ml) when indicated. MTb strains were grown in Middlebroook 7H9 broth (Difco) supplemented with ADC (NaCl, 8.1 g/liter; bovine albumin fraction V (Calbiochem), 50 g/liter; d-glucose, 20 g/liter), 0.02% glycerol, and 0.05% Tween 80 (Sigma) or on Middlebroook 7H11 agar (Difco) supplemented with OADC enrichment (as ADC but including also 0.6 ml/liter oleic acid (ICN Biochemicals) and 3.6 mm sodium hydroxide). Where indicated hygromycin (50 μg/ml) or 2% sucrose was added (25Pelicic V. Jackson M. Reyrat J.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10955-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). H37Rv (Pasteur) was used as the parental strain of the H37Rv mmpL8::hyg mutant and H37Rv (ATCC, Manassas, VA) for the generation of the pks2::hyg.Nucleic Acid Techniques—E. coli transformations, cloning, and PCR were based on standard conditions (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Southern blotting and hybridization procedures were performed as described previously (27Domenech P. Menendez M.C. Garcia M.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 116: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mycobacterial DNA was isolated using the protocol of Pelicic et al. (25Pelicic V. Jackson M. Reyrat J.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10955-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Transformation of MTb was carried out as described previously (28Snapper S.B. Melton R.E. Mustafa S. Kieser T. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar).Construction of the mmpL8 and pks2 Disrupted Mutants—Generation of the MTb disrupted mutants (mmpL8::hyg and pks2::hyg) was accomplished by homologous recombination using the system developed by Pelicic et al. (25Pelicic V. Jackson M. Reyrat J.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10955-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). A 2.1-kbp fragment containing the mmpL8 gene (nucleotide positions 538-2686) was generated by PCR and cloned into the SpeI site of the vector pcDNA2.1 (Invitrogen). A 1.6-kbp fragment carrying the hyg gene was cloned into the mmpL8 gene at the HpaI site (position 1656). Finally the 3.7-kbp fragment harboring the mmpL8::hyg gene was excised and cloned into the mycobacterial shuttle vector pPR27 (25Pelicic V. Jackson M. Reyrat J.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10955-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The pks2 mutant was produced by PCR amplification of a 2-kbp fragment containing the pks2 gene (positions 3302-5310). This fragment was cloned into the vector pCRBlunt (Invitrogen), and a 1.6-kbp fragment carrying the hyg gene was substituted for a 1-kbp internal NheI (position 4457)-BglII (position 4775) segment. The 2.6-kbp fragment containing the disrupted pks2 sequence and hygromycin resistance determinant was excised and cloned into the mycobacterial shuttle vector pPR27 (25Pelicic V. Jackson M. Reyrat J.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10955-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Transformations were plated on 7H11 with 50 μg/ml hygromycin at 32 °C for 5 weeks. The resulting colonies were grown at 32 °C in 10 ml of 7H9 containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin and subsequently were plated on 7H11 with 50 μg/ml hygromycin and 2% sucrose at 39 °C. DNA from HygR, SucR, and TR (hygromycin-, sucrose-, and temperature-resistant) colonies was digested with XhoI, transferred to Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences) by Southern blot, and hybridized with a 2.1-kbp fragment probe of the mmpL8 gene of MTb H37Rv Pasteur. The pks2::hyg deletion-replacement was confirmed through Southern analysis of EcoRI- or EcoRV-restricted DNA that was hybridized with both the 2-kbp pks2 fragment generated by PCR (see above) and the 1-kbp fragment released prior to insertion of the hygromycin cassette.Lipid Analysis and Sulfolipid Purification—100-ml cultures of the different MTb strains (wild type, mmpL8::hyg, and pks2::hyg mutants) were grown to an OD650 of 0.3. Metabolic labeling of the methyl-branched fatty acids was achieved by incubating these cultures in the presence of 1 μCi/ml sodium [1-14C]propionate (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, specific activity ≈ 56 mCi/mmol) for 24 h prior to lipid extraction. Similarly, sulfated lipids were labeled by adding 3.3 μCi/ml [35S]Na2SO4 (Amersham Biosciences, specific activity ≈ 100 mCi/mmol) and incubated for 96 h. Mycobacteria were harvested from the media by centrifugation (750 g/15 min), and prior to lipid extraction the culture supernatants were sterilized by filtration through a 0.2-μm-pore size membrane. Bacteria-associated lipids were extracted by two different methods. Bacteria-associated total lipids were extracted using the Folch method (29Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which includes two extractions with chloroform: methanol (2:1) and three washes with chloroform, methanol, and 0.58% NaCl in water at ratios 3:48:47. Alternatively, separation of bacteria-associated apolar and polar lipids was accomplished by two petroleum ether extractions (apolar) prior to chloroform:methanol extraction, following the procedures described by Slayden and Barry (30Slayden R.A. Barry III, C.E. Parish T. Stoker N.G. Mycobacterium tuberculosis Protocols. 54. Humane Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 229-245Google Scholar). Apolar lipids present in the culture supernatant were extracted with 2 volumes of petroleum ether. Polar lipids in the supernatant were extracted as described elsewhere (31Constant P. Perez E. Malaga W. Laneelle M.A. Saurel O. Daffe M. Guilhot C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38148-38158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed using 250-μm silica gel 60 plates (EM SCIENCE) with chloroform:methanol:H2O (65:25:4) as the developing solvent. TLC plates were visualized using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences).For purification of SL-1 and SL-N, 4-liter cultures of H37Rv and mmpL8::hyg were labeled with 1 mCi of [35S]Na2SO4 (Amersham Biosciences, 100 mCi/mmol) as is indicated above. Bacteria-associated lipids (apolar for SL-1, polar for SL-N, prepared as above) were passed over a silica gel 50 column and eluted with 9:1 chloroform:methanol (3 volumes), 5:1 chloroform:methanol (3 volumes), and 1:1 chloroform: methanol (6 volumes). Fractions containing sulfolipids were identified by TLC and autoradiography and were then pooled and dried. Next, the pooled fractions were applied to an anion exchange column (PS-DVB DEAE, 10 mm × 100 mm, 8-μm beads, Vydac) on a Waters 2690 HPLC. The column was activated prior to injection of the sample by equilibrating with chloroform:methanol:acetic acid (800:200:0.6) at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Elution of the lipids was done using a 0-35% gradient over 40 min with chloroform:methanol:triethylamine (800:200:1.39) as the eluting solvent. 2-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting and TLC. Purity of samples was assessed by staining TLC plates with 5% phosphomolybdic acid (Sigma) and charring.Neutral Red Assay—Chemical staining of H37Rv and the mmpL8::hyg strain was carried out following the protocol described by Soto et al. (32Soto C.Y. Andreu N. Gibert I. Luquin M. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2002; 40: 3021-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).GC-MS of Fatty Acid Methyl Esters—Fatty acid methyl esters from purified SL-1 and SL-N were prepared following the protocol described previously (30Slayden R.A. Barry III, C.E. Parish T. Stoker N.G. Mycobacterium tuberculosis Protocols. 54. Humane Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 229-245Google Scholar). GC-MS was carried out on a Hewlett Packard 5890 instrument operated in splitless mode using an HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm). The injection port temperature was 310 °C, and the column temperature was ramped from 180 to 310 °C at 10 °C/min followed by an additional 15 min at 310 °C with 8 p.s.i. helium.Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectral analyses were performed at the Yale Cancer Center Mass Spectrometry Resource and the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory. For both electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (EI-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), purified SL-N was dissolved in chloroform and then diluted with methanol, 1% ammonium hydroxide (for negative ion analysis) or methanol, 1% formic acid (for positive ion analysis) to a useable concentration. The samples were analyzed on a Q-Tof1 (Waters/Micromass) mass spectrometer using the nanospray technique for both positive and negative modes. For the MS/MS spectra, the collision cell was pressurized with argon, and the collision energy was adjusted to give the optimal spectrum, which was -4 electron volts for positive ion spectra and -70 electron volts for negative ion spectra. The spectra were calibrated using sodium iodide in either the positive or negative ion mode.Proton and COSY NMR Spectra—The 1H (one-dimensional) and COSY spectra of 35S-labeled SL-N were obtained on a Varian VXR-500S NMR spectrometer at 30 °C in CDCl3:CD3OD (2:1).Mouse Experiments—Prior to infection, well dispersed liquid cultures were adjusted to an OD650 nm of 0.5 and stored at -70 °C as 20% glycerol stocks. Inocula were prepared by diluting these stocks to 4 × 106 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml in PBS/Tween 80 (0.05%). Eight-week-old C57Bl/6 or B6D2/F1 mice (Taconic) were infected using a BioAerosol nebulizing generator (CH Technologies Inc., Westwood, NJ) for 10 min. Bacterial numbers were enumerated at 1, 14, 49, 63, 98, 182, and 205 days post-infection (4 mice/time point) by homogenizing the lungs and spleens of infected mice in 1 ml of 7H9 medium and plating 10-fold serial dilutions on 7H11 medium. An additional 12 mice/group were used in survival studies. Survival fractions were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method (33Kaplan E.L. Meier P. J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 1958; 53: 457-481Crossref Scopus (47684) Google Scholar), and the log-rank test was used to determine statistical significance of observed survival differences (GraphPad Prism version 3.0; GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).Cytokine Expression Studies—At 14 days post-infection, lungs of euthanized mice (4 mice/group) were removed and immediately snap-frozen on dry ice/ethanol. Tissues were homogenized in 3 ml of RNAzolB (Cinna/BiotecX, Houston, TX) using a tissue Polytron homogenizer. RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions, and 5 μg of RNA from each sample was reverse transcribed into cDNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Ambion). Biotinylated cDNA probes were hybridized to cytokine-chemokine cDNAs spotted on GEArray membranes according to the manufacturer's directions (SuperArray, Bethesda, MD). Arrays were developed with CDP-Star chemiluminescence substrate and recorded with x-ray film. The ScanAlyze 2 program was used for image analysis, and the GEArray-Analyzer was used to process the raw data. Gene expression was normalized to the signal derived from β-actin. 2-fold difference in mRNA expression between strains was considered significant.RESULTSDisruption of the MTb mmpL8 Gene Interrupts SL-1 Biosynthesis—Disruption of the mmpL8 gene in MTb H37Rv was accomplished by insertion of a hygromycin resistance cassette within the coding sequence of a cloned copy of this gene followed by homologous recombination of the inactivated allele onto the chromosome of MTb using a plasmid based on the pPR27 vector (temperature-sensitive mycobacterial origin of replication and sacB negative selection marker) (25Pelicic V. Jackson M. Reyrat J.M. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Gicquel B. Guilhot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10955-10960Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows the results of Southern blot analysis of chromosomal DNA from six clones (lanes 2-7) obtained from this procedure compared with DNA from the H37Rv wild-type parent (lanes 1 and 8). In each clone the presence of a 3.7-kbp fragment hybridizing with an mmpL8 probe that recognizes a 2.1-kbp fragment on the wild-type chromosome suggests that all six have the expected 1.6-kbp insertion of the hygromycin resistance cassette. One of these mutants was selected for further analysis.Because of the chromosomal co-localization of mmpL8 and pks2 (Fig. 1B), we examined lipid extracts from the mmpL8::hyg mutant following metabolic labeling of the methyl-branched fatty acids of MTb H37Rv, MTb H37Rv mmpL8::hyg, and an MTb H37Rv pks2::hyg mutant with [1-14C]propionic acid. Bacteria-associated “apolar” (petroleum ether-extractable) and “polar” (chloroform:methanol-extractable) lipids were obtained from these strains and analyzed by TLC (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-8). SL-1, with an RF of 0.92, was mainly extracted in the apolar fraction, suggesting localization within the peripheral region of the cell wall. SL-1 was present in both H37Rv wild-type strains tested (the type strain from the American Type Tissue Collection and the sequenced strain from the Institut Pasteur) (Fig. 2A, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). As expected SL-1 was not produced by an MTb pks2 mutant (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 8), but surprisingly the MTb mmpL8::hyg mutant also failed to produce mature SL-1 (lanes 2 and 6). This mutant instead accumulated a more polar metabolite (RF 0.5) that incorporated propionate and appeared in the polar fraction (Fig. 2A, lane 6).Fig. 2Disruption of the M. tuberculosis mmpL8 gene interrupts SL-1 biosynthesis and results in accumulation of SL-N. A, autoradiogram of a TLC of [1-14C]propionic acid-labeled (lanes 1-8) and [35S]Na2SO4-labeled (lanes 9-12) lipids developed in chloroform:methanol: water (65:25:4). Lanes 1-4 are bacteria-associated “apolar lipids” (extracted with petroleum ether). Lanes 5-8 are bacteria-associated “polar lipids” (extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1) after the petroleum ether extraction), and lanes 9-12 are bacteria-associated total lipids (total lipids extracted with chloroform:methanol (2:1) following the Folch method). Lipids are from H37Rv (Pasteur strain; lanes 1, 5, and 9), mmpL8::hyg mutant (lanes 2, 6, and 10), H37Rv (ATCC 27294; lanes 3, 7, and 11), and pks2::hyg mutant (lanes 4, 8, and 12). B, autoradiogram of a TLC of [1-14C]propionic acid-labeled bacteria-associated lipids (lanes 1-4) and lipids extracted from the culture supernatants (lanes 5-8). Lanes 1 and 5, apolar lipids from H37Rv (Pasteur); lanes 2 and 6, apolar lipids from mmpL8::hyg mutant; lanes 3 and 7, polar lipids from H37Rv (Pasteur); lanes 4 and 8, polar lipids from mmpL8::hyg mutant. The solvent is chloroform:methanol:H2O (65:25:4). C, neutral red assay of H37Rv (Pasteur) and mmpL8::hyg (mmpL8 KO).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To establish whether this metabolite contained sulfate we labeled cells by growing them in the presence of [35S]Na2SO4 (Fig. 2A, lanes 9-12). In the wild-type strain the majority of the [35S]Na2SO4 was incorporated into SL-1 (Fig. 2A, lanes 9 and 11), confirming that this was the most abundant sulfolipid produced in MTb. In contrast, the mmpL8 mutant incorporated [35S]Na2SO4 into a molecule that co-migrated by TLC with the propionate-labeled metabolite (RF 0.5) (Fig. 2A, lane 10). These results suggest that inactivation of the mmpL8 gene of MTb interrupted the normal biosynthesis of SL-1 and led to the accumulation of a more polar molecule, designated SL-N, that contained both sulfate and methyl-branched fatty acids.SL-N Is Localized inside the Cell Envelope—We compared lipids associated with bacterial cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 1-4) with those found in the culture supernatant (Fig. 2B, lanes 5-8) for wild-type and mmpL8::hyg mutant strains. SL-1 was present in both the apolar and polar lipid extracts of wild-type culture supernatant (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 7), whereas SL-N was not found in the supernatant from the mmpL8 mutant (lanes 6 and 8). While some SL-1 was also found in association with the bacterial cells, SL-N was found exclusively in association with the bacterial cells. This result suggests that SL-1 normally occupies a peripheral location within the mycobacterial envelope and can be shed into the culture supernatant, whereas SL-N apparently occupies a more integral location and may be exclusively retained within the cytosol.In an attempt to address whether SL-N was peripherally associated with the cell membrane but was not efficiently shed into the medium, we examined the neutral red binding ability of the mmpL8::hyg mutant. The neutral red assay has been used extensively to distinguish between avirulent and virulent strains of MTb because of its specificity for labeling cells producing SL-1 (15Goren M.B. Brokl O.

The capacity to bind this molecule has been interpreted as indicating a surface-accessible location of the sulfatides, whose strongly acidic sulfate interacts ionically with the cationic dye (36Middlebrook G.

https://openalex.org/W2158113590,"The motility of molecular motors and the dynamic instability of microtubules are key dynamic processes for mitotic spindle assembly and function. We report here that one of the mitotic kinesins that localizes to chromosomes, Xklp1 from Xenopus laevis , could inhibit microtubule growth and shrinkage. This effect appeared to be mediated by a structural change in the microtubule lattice. We also found that Xklp1 could act as a fast, nonprocessive, plus end–directed molecular motor. The integration of the two properties, motility and inhibition of microtubule dynamics, in one molecule emphasizes the versatile properties of kinesin family members."

We conclude that des-Gly-PCs are not generated as an immediate by-product, but rather that the enzyme catalyzes a dipeptidyl transfer reaction in which some of the energy liberated upon cleavage of the Cys–Gly bonds of the γ-Glu-Cys donors in the first phase of the catalytic cycle is conserved through the formation of a two site-substituted γ-Glu-Cys acyl-enzyme intermediate whose hydrolysis provides the energy required for the formation of the new peptide bond required for the extension of PC chain length by one γ-Glu-Cys repeat per catalytic cycle.

PC-dependent vacuolar Cd2+ sequestration is perhaps best understood in S. pombe, in which the hmt1+ gene product, a PC-selective ATP-binding cassette transporter, pumps cadmium·PC complexes and apo-PCs from the cytosol into the vacuole at the expense of ATP (3Ortiz D.F.

These are canonical PCs, homo-PCs (iso-PC(β-Ala)), hydroxymethyl-PCs (iso-PC(Ser)), iso-PCs (iso-PC(Glu)), and des-Gly-PCs, containing n γ-Glu-Cys repeats capped C-terminally by a Gly, β-Ala, Ser, Glu, or no residue, respectively (5Zenk M.H.

Biophys. 1999; 31: 19-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). PCs are synthesized post-translationally. PC synthases (so-called γ-glutamylcysteine dipeptidyl transpeptidases, EC 2.3.2.15) catalyze the net synthesis of PCs from GSH, from GSH and previously synthesized PCs, or from previously synthesized PCs alone to generate polymers containing 2–11 γ-Glu-Cys repeats. Although it has been almost 15 years since pioneering investigations by Grill et al. (13Grill E. Löffler S. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 89: 6838-6842Crossref Google Scholar) yielded partially purified preparations of an enzyme capable of catalyzing these reactions, it is only in the last several years that its molecular identity was determined by the independent cloning and characterization of genes encoding PC synthases (14Ha S.-B.

Originally isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPCS1), S. pombe (SpPCS), and wheat (Triticum aestivum; TaPCS1), these genes encode 50–55-kDa polypeptides bearing 40–50% sequence similarity to each other (14Ha S.-B.

Arabidopsis cad1 mutants, which are cadmium-hypersensitive and PC-deficient (17Howden R. Goldsbrough P.B. Andersen C.R. Cobbett C.S. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 1059-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), are mutated in AtPCS1 (14Ha S.-B. Smith A.P. Howden R. Dietrich W.M. Bugg S. O'Connell M.J. Goldsbrough P.B.

The capacity of cell-free extracts from AtPCS1- or SpPCS-transformed cells of Escherichia coli (14Ha S.-B. Smith A.P. Howden R. Dietrich W.M. Bugg S. O'Connell M.J. Goldsbrough P.B. Cobbett C.S.

A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) establishes that AtPCS1 and SpPCS (and by implication, TaPCS1) and their equivalents from the same or different sources, e.g. AtPCS2 (18Cazale A.C. Clemens S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), are not only necessary, but also sufficient for PC biosynthesis. To the inventory of functionally defined PC synthase genes identified can be added ce-pcs1 from an animal source, the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (19Clemens S. Schroeder J.I. Degenkolb T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3640-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 20Vatamaniuk O.K. Bucher E.A. Ward J.T. Rea P.A. J. Biol.

Trends Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 61-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), whose translation product is likewise not only sufficient for the synthesis of PCs in vitro, but is also necessary for the detoxification of heavy metals in the intact organism (20Vatamaniuk O.K. Bucher E.A. Ward J.T. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20817-20820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This was completely unexpected because never before had the involvement of PCs in heavy metal detoxification in animals been even cursorily speculated. The facility with which recombinant PC synthases, as exemplified by AtPCS1, can now be purified to apparent homogeneity to yield PC synthase preparations with catalytic activities exceeding those of previous preparations from plant sources (13Grill E. Löffler S. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 89: 6838-6842Crossref Google Scholar) by >103-fold (16Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 22Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31451-31459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) for detailed mechanistic analyses has exposed some basic deficiencies in our understanding of PC biosynthesis. Notable among these is the realization that heavy metals do not bind directly to the enzyme to activate PC biosynthesis, but instead act as substrate ligands for a bisubstrate-substituted enzyme transpeptidation reaction in which free GSH and its corresponding heavy metal thiolate are cosubstrates (22Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31451-31459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Although AtPCS1 is primarily activated post-translationally in the intact plant and the purified enzyme is able to bind heavy metals directly, metal binding per se is not responsible for catalytic activation (22Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31451-31459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). As illustrated by Cd2+- and Zn2+-dependent AtPCS1-mediated catalysis, the kinetics of PC synthesis approximate a substituted enzyme mechanism in which micromolar concentrations of a heavy metal·GS thiolate (e.g. bis(glutathionato)cadmium (cadmium·GS2) or bis(glutathionato)zinc) and millimolar concentrations of free GSH act as low and high affinity cosubstrates, respectively. Furthermore, as demonstrated by the capacity of AtPCS1 to mediate the net synthesis of S-alkyl-PCs from S-alkylglutathiones with biphasic kinetics, consistent with the sufficiency of S-alkylglutathiones as both high and low affinity substrates in media devoid of metals, even heavy metal thiolates are dispensable for core catalysis. On the one hand, these findings reveal that the dependence of AtPCS1 and other PC synthases on the provision of heavy metal ions for activity in media containing GSH and other thiol peptides is a reflection of this enzyme's requirement for GSH-like peptides containing blocked thiol groups for activity. On the other hand, they highlight two other major shortcomings in our understanding of PC biosynthesis. The first is that it is not known unequivocally if PC synthase is a dipeptidyl- or tripeptidyltransferase. The second, which is related to the first, is that the identity of the substituted intermediate formed by the enzyme during catalysis has not been defined. Whether PC synthases are dipeptidyl- or tripeptidyltransferases is not only of relevance for understanding the catalytic mechanism of this class of transpeptidase, but may also be critical in determining the types of PCs these enzymes are capable of synthesizing. In most studies of partially purified preparations of the enzyme, PC synthase-catalyzed GSH-dependent PC synthesis has been considered to proceed by the transpeptidation of a γ-Glu-Cys unit from one GSH molecule to another to form PC2 and, after the accumulation of sufficient (substrate) levels of PCs, by the transpeptidation of a γ-Glu-Cys unit from GSH to a PC (PCn) molecule to generate PCn+1 (13Grill E. Löffler S. Winnacker E.-L. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 89: 6838-6842Crossref Google Scholar, 23Cobbett C.S. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 335-337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Appropriately, PC synthase has been defined as a γ-glutamylcysteine dipeptidyl transpeptidase and presumed to catalyze a reaction of the type shown in Equation 1, (γ−EC)G+(γ−EC)nG→(γ−EC)(γ−EC)nG+G(Eq. 1) in which chain extension proceeds from the C to N terminus with cleavage of the Cys–Gly peptide bond of the donor, not the acceptor. However, inspection of the literature reveals that the notion that PC synthase is a tripeptidyl transpeptidase is equally tenable. There are no published data to refute a scheme in which PC synthase catalyzes the transfer of γ-Glu-Cys-Gly units in a reaction of the type shown in Equation 2, (γ−EC)G+(γ−EC)nG→(γ−EC)n(γ−EC)G+G(Eq. 2) in which case, chain extension would proceed from the N to C terminus, not from the C to N terminus, after cleavage of the Cys–Gly peptide bond of the acceptor, not the donor. An implication of the possibility that PC synthases are tripeptidyl transpeptidases, when combined with their capacity to synthesize PCs from other PCs without the direct participation of GSH is a simple mechanism for the synthesis of des-Gly-PCs (see Fig. 1). If γ-Glu-Cys is construed as the limiting case of a des-Gly-PC (des-Gly-PC1) and GSH as the limiting case of a PC (PC1), Equation 1 assumes the general form (see Fig. 1A) shown in Equation 3, PCn+PCm→PCn+1+PCm−1(Eq. 3) and Equation 2 assumes the general form (see Fig. 1B) shown in Equation 4. PCn+PCm→PCn+1+des−Gly−PCm−1+G(Eq. 4) It is not known if a by-product model of the type shown in Equation 4 and Fig. 1B could be the sole mechanism for the synthesis of des-Gly-PCs, one that might account for the synthesis of this class of thiol peptides in vivo, but two properties of des-Gly-PCs are at least consistent with such a possibility. The first is the seemingly broad distribution of this PC subclass in that it has been detected in many species of plants and fungi after long-term exposure to heavy metals (see above). This might indicate, as would be predicted from the by-product model, that most organisms able to synthesize PCs also synthesize des-Gly-PCs. The second property is that the levels of des-Gly-PCs, in the few cases in which they have been determined, increase most appreciably after several days of exposure to heavy metals, after the initial burst of PC2 and PC3 accumulation (7Meuwly P. Thibault P. Schwan A.L. Rauser W.E. Plant J. 1995; 7: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This would be expected if, as implied by the by-product model, des-Gly-PCs arise as a result of the synthesis of longer chain PCs from previously synthesized shorter chain PCs. The formation of a covalent enzyme intermediate during catalysis is implicit in the finding that the steady-state kinetics of AtPCS1-catalyzed PC synthesis from GSH in media containing heavy metals approximate a scheme in which heavy metal thiolate and GSH interact via a substituted enzyme intermediate, not via a ternary complex, to form PC2 (22Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31451-31459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Specifically, given that at least one peptide bond must be cleaved and that at least one new peptide bond forms for each molecule of PC2 synthesized, regardless of whether the PC synthase is a dipeptidyl- or tripeptidyltransferase (Equation 1 or 2; see above), and that the initial attack on the carbonyl carbon of the peptide bond to be cleaved must be by a nucleophile, it is almost inevitable that the substituted enzyme intermediate is a γ-Glu-Cys acyl intermediate. If correct, two important corollaries follow. The first is that the initial nucleophilic attack on the scissile bond is by an enzyme hydroxyl-derived oxyanion or thiol-derived thiolate anion to generate an enzyme γ-Glu-Cys oxyester or thioester, respectively. The second, a consideration that has been neglected in the literature despite the status of PC synthase as both a peptidase and a peptide synthase, is that at least some of the energy required for subsequent condensation of the two substrate molecules is derived from acylation of the enzyme coincident with cleavage of the first substrate. A mechanism for PC synthase analogous to those of serine proteases (24Kraut J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 331-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar), cysteine proteases (25Kamphuis I.G. Drenth J. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 182: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and cysteine hydrolases (26Cheah E. Austin C. Ashley G.W. Ollis D. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 575-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 27Humm A. Fritsche E. Mann K. Gohl M. Huber R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 28Humm A. Fritsche E. Steinbacher S. Huber R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3373-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) is therefore invoked, except that, instead of mediating a dissipative hydrolysis reaction, at least some of the energy required for condensation of the γ-Glu-Cys unit from one substrate with the other substrate during the second PC synthetic phase of the catalytic cycle is derived from an enzyme oxyester of intermediate energy or an enzyme thioester of high energy formed during the first phase of the cycle. In this study, we have described investigations directed at determining whether AtPCS1 is a dipeptidyl or tripeptidyl transpeptidase and elucidation of the identity of the substituted enzyme intermediate formed during catalysis. In so doing, we have established that PC synthase is a dipeptidyltransferase that undergoes γ-Glu-Cys acylation by GSH at two sites during catalysis concomitant with the release of Gly. Free GSH alone was capable of acylating the first site on the enzyme, but not the second unless Cd2+ was added to the reaction medium. Of the two conserved Ser and five conserved Cys residues in the catalytic N-terminal half of AtPCS1, only one (Cys56) appears to be essential for catalysis and acylation of the first site by free GSH. We propose that the energy required for each cycle of PC chain extension is derived from the formation of an enzyme cysteinyl thioester at position 56 and presumably a non-seryl, non-cysteinyl oxyester at another position upon the Cys–Gly bond cleavage of at least two incoming GSH molecules. Heterologous Expression of AtPCS1-FLAG—The mutant S. cerevisiae ycf1Δ strain DTY167 (MATα ura3-52 leu2-3,112 his-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2-801 suc2-Δ9 ycf1::hisG), deficient in vacuolar Cd2+ sequestration (29Li Z.-S. Szcypka M. Lu Y.-P. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), was employed for the studies of heterologously expressed wild-type and in vitro mutated AtPCS1-FLAG. In all cases, AtPCS1 engineered to contain a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag fusion (AtPCS1-FLAG) was constitutively expressed from the E. coli yeast shuttle vector pYES3 as described (16Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). For assays of the capacity of heterologously expressed wild-type and mutant AtPCS1-FLAG to suppress Cd2+ hypersensitivity, S. cerevisiae strain DTY167 was transformed with wild-type or mutant pYES3-AtPCS1-FLAG and grown at 30 °Cto A600 ∼ 1.8 in AHC medium supplemented with glucose and tryptophan before inoculating aliquots into 2-ml volumes of the same medium containing different concentrations of CdCl2. A600 was measured after growth for an additional 24 h. To ensure that the effects seen were attributable to the AtPCS1 inserts, empty vector (pYES3) controls were employed. For the purification of wild-type or mutant AtPCS1-FLAG for in vitro assays of PC synthetic activity and/or acylation by radiolabeled GSH, the soluble fractions from DTY167/pYES3-AtPCS1-FLAG cells were prepared by the disruption of spheroplasts (16Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and the FLAG-tagged protein was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography of the soluble fraction on an anti-FLAG antibody M2 affinity gel column (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, except that the wash and elution buffers contained 10% (v/v) glycerol in addition to 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 0.1 m glycine HCl (pH 3.5), respectively. When necessary, free Gly was removed from the purified enzyme preparations by ultrafiltration. Site-directed Mutagenesis of AtPCS1—Site-directed mutagenesis of AtPCS1 was performed directly on the pYES3-AtPCS1-FLAG vector. In all cases, the mutagenic oligonucleotides were designed to singly substitute each conserved Ser or Cys codon in the catalytic N-terminal half of AtPCS1 with an Ala codon or a Ser or Ala codon, respectively. The sequences of the 12 mutagenic oligonucleotides (with the positions of the conserved Ser and Cys codons shown in boldface) were as follows: S21A, GCCATTGACTTTTCTGCTGCCGAAGGGAAG; S164A, GGGAATGGTCACTTTGCTCCTATTGGTGGC; C56S, TCCGAACCTGCGTATAGTGGTTTGGCTAGTC; C90S, GAATCAATGTTGGATAGCTGCGAA-CCTCTGG; C91S, TCAATGTTGCATTGCAGCGAACCTCTGGAAG; C109S, TTTGGAAAAGTTGTCAGTTTGGCTCATTGTT; C113S, GTCTGTTTGGCTCATAGTTCAGGAGCAAAAG; C56A, CCGAACCTGCGTATGCTGGTTTGGCTAGTCTC; C90A, GAATCAATGTTGGATGCTTGCGAACCTCTGG; C91A, GAATCAATGTTGGATTGCGCTGAACCTCTGGAAG; C109A, CATTTGGAAGAGTTGTCGCTTTGGCTCATTGTTC; and C113A, GTCTGTTTGGCTCATGCTTCAGGAGCAAAAGTTG. Uracilated single-stranded template DNA was isolated from pYES3-AtPCS1-FLAG-transformed E. coli CJ236, and the site-directed mutations were introduced by second strand synthesis from the template using mutant oligonucleotides (30Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4903) Google Scholar, 31Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). In all cases, mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing the coding sequence encompassing the mutation before yeast transformation. Measurement of PC Synthase Activity and PCs—PC synthase activity was assayed routinely in reaction medium containing purified wild-type or mutant AtPCS1-FLAG and the indicated concentrations of GSH, S-N-ethylmaleimidylglutathione (NEM-GS), PCs and/or CdCl2 in 100 mm HEPES/BTP buffer (pH 8.0) (22Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31451-31459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). For RP-HPLC, the reactions were made 5% (w/v) with sulfosalicylic acid and centrifuged before loading aliquots of the supernatants onto a Varian Microsorb C18 RP column (250 × 4.6 mm). The column was developed with a linear (20 min) gradient of water and 0.05% (v/v) phosphoric acid to acetonitrile and 0.05% phosphoric acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. For the quantitation of PCs, thiols were estimated spectrophotometrically at 412 nm by reacting aliquots (500 μl) of the column fractions with 0.8 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB; 500 μl) dissolved in 250 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) (33Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (21624) Google Scholar). For the quantitation of NEM-PCs, free amino groups were estimated fluorometrically by reacting aliquots of the column fractions with 0.4 m sodium borate (pH 9.7) (200 μl) and fluorescamine (20 μl of a 3 mg/ml solution dissolved in acetone) (32Udenfriend S. Stein S. Böhler P. Dairman W. Leingruber W. Weigele M. Science. 1972; 178: 871-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (2202) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured at excitation and emission wavelengths of 390 and 475 nm, respectively, as described (22Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31451-31459Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Calibration was with GSH. The PC contents of yeast whole cell extracts were determined by RP-HPLC analysis of spheroplast extracts as described (16Vatamaniuk O.K. Mari S. Lu Y.-P. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7110-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Purification of PC2—For the studies of AtPCS1-FLAG-catalyzed PC synthesis from PC2 and GSH, PC2 was synthesized by incubating At-PCS1-FLAG (1 μg) in 1 ml of 200 mm HEPES/BTP buffer (pH 8.0) containing 20 mm GSH, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 100 μm CdCl2 at 30 °C for 1 h. After terminating the reaction with 5% (w/v) sulfosalicylic acid, PC2 was purified semipreparatively by RP-fast protein liquid chromatography of the supernatant on a 100 × 6.4-mm Resource RPC column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was developed with a linear (40 min) gradient of water and 0.05% (v/v) phosphoric acid to 10% (v/v) acetonitrile and 0.05% (v/v) phosphoric acid at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Thiol detection was as described for the routine assays, except that only 50-μl aliquots of the column fractions were reacted with 50 μl of DTNB in 96-well plates. The fractions corresponding to PC2 were pooled, neutralized with 1 m Tris, lyophilized, and stored at -80 °C until used. Synthesis of [3H]Gly-labeled NEM-GS—For investigations of PC synthesis and glycine release from S-alkylglutathione derivatives, [3H]Gly-labeled GSH was S-alkylated with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) to generate [3H]Gly-labeled NEM-GS. After removal of the antioxidant (dithiothreitol) in which [3H]Gly-labeled GSH was shipped by extraction with acidic ethyl acetate immediately before use and its combination with unlabeled GSH to yield a 100 mm solution in 100 mm HEPES/BTP buffer (pH 8.0), [3H]Gly-labeled NEM-GS was synthesized by the addition of an equimolar concentration of NEM to the solution and reaction on ice for 1 h. Upon completion of the reaction, as assessed from the exhaustion of DTNB-reactive free thiols, the reaction mixture was diluted to a final ["
https://openalex.org/W2118354429,"Pyramidal cells show marked variation in their morphology, including dendritic structure, which is correlated with physiological diversity; however, it is not known how this variation is related to a cell's role within neural networks. In this report, we describe correlations among electrosensory lateral line lobe (ELL) pyramidal cells' highly variable dendritic morphology and their ability to adaptively cancel redundant inputs via an anti-Hebbian form of synaptic plasticity. A subset of cells, those with the largest apical dendrites, are plastic, but those with the smallest dendrites are not. A model of the network's connectivity predicts that efficient redundancy reduction requires that nonplastic cells provide feedback input to those that are plastic. Anatomical results confirm the model's prediction of optimal network architecture. These results provide a demonstration of different roles for morphological/physiological variants of a single cell type within a neural network performing a well-defined function."

https://openalex.org/W2108982986,"Cone photoreceptors tonically release neurotransmitter in the dark through a continuous cycle of exocytosis and endocytosis. Here, using the synaptic vesicle marker FM1-43, we elucidate specialized features of the vesicle cycle. Unlike retinal bipolar cell terminals, where stimulation triggers bulk membrane retrieval, cone terminals appear to exclusively endocytose small vesicles. These retain their integrity until exocytosis, without pooling their membranes in endosomes. Endocytosed vesicles rapidly disperse through the terminal and are reused with no apparent delay. Unlike other synapses where most vesicles are immobilized and held in reserve, only a small fraction (<15%) becomes immobilized in cones. Photobleaching experiments suggest that vesicles move by diffusion and not by molecular motors on the cytoskeleton and that vesicle movement is not rate limiting for release. The huge reservoir of vesicles that move rapidly throughout cone terminals and the lack of a reserve pool are unique features, providing cones with a steady supply for continuous release."

https://openalex.org/W2075449779,"Hyperpolarization-activated HCN channels are modulated by direct binding of cyclic nucleotides. For HCN2 channels, cAMP shifts the voltage dependence for activation, with relatively little change in the maximal conductance. By contrast, in spHCN channels, cAMP relieves a rapid inactivation process and produces a large increase in maximum conductance. Our results suggest that these two effects of cAMP represent the same underlying process. We also find that spHCN inactivation occurs not by closure of a specialized inactivation gate, as for other voltage-dependent channels, but by reclosure of the same intracellular gate opened upon activation. Effectively, the activation gate exhibits a ""desensitization to voltage,"" perhaps by slippage of the coupling between the voltage sensors and the gate. Differences in the initial coupling efficiency could allow cAMP to produce either the inactivation or the shift phenotype by strengthening effective coupling: a shift would naturally occur if coupling is already strong in the absence of cAMP."

Enzymes that mediate the hydrolysis of this composite structure are modular proteins that contain non-catalytic carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) that enhance catalytic activity.

Microbial degradation of the plant cell wall is the primary mechanism by which organic carbon is recycled in the biosphere. The plant cell wall is a complex insoluble structure that is highly recalcitrant to biological attack (1Brett C.T. Waldren K. Black M. Charlewood B.

To increase the efficiency of this degradative process microorganisms synthesize modular plant cell wall hydrolases in which the catalytic modules are attached via linker peptides to non-catalytic carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs 1The abbreviations used are: CBM, carbohydrate-binding module; CsCBM, CBM from a Clostridium stercorarium putative xylanase; CtCBM, CBM from Clostridium thermocellum Xyn11A; d.p., degree of polymerization; G2, cellobiose; G3, cellotriose; G6, cellohexaose; Cel5A, endoglucanase 5A; HEC, hydroxyethyl cellulose.

It should be noted, however, that many plant cell wall hydrolases that do not hydrolyze cellulose contain CBMs that interact specifically with the crystalline form of this polysaccharide (2Tomme P.

Based on primary structural similarities CBMs have been grouped into 34 families (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY (13Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert J.J. Davies G. Henrissat B. Svensson B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Bioengineering. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1999: 3-12Google Scholar)). Although the ligand specificity of families 1, 5, and 10, which bind to crystalline polysaccharides, is invariant, there are considerable differences in carbohydrate recognition in other CBM families. For example, the CBM2 family contains proteins that bind to xylan (14Black G.W. Hazlewood G.P. Millward-Sadler S.J. Laurie J.I. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and crystalline cellulose (12Ferreira L.M. Durrant A.J. Hall J. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Biochem.

Microbiology. 2001; 147: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The CBMs described to date are β-stranded proteins in which the topology of the carbohydrate-binding site reflects the nature of the target ligand. For example, CBMs that bind to crystalline cellulose (known as type A modules) contain a planar hydrophobic ligand binding surface (16Kraulis J. Clore G.M. Nilges M. Jones T.A. Pettersson G.

By contrast, CBMs that interact with individual polysaccharide chains (type B modules) accommodate their target ligands in a cleft of varying depth (9Boraston A.B. Nurizzo D. Notenboom V. Ducros V.

In general both type A and type B CBMs interact with five or six saccharide units via hydrophobic stacking interactions between alternate sugar rings and aromatic amino acids, although hydrogen bonds also play an important role in carbohydrate recognition by type B modules (22Xie H.

The three-dimensional structure of almost all type B CBMs determined to date conform to a classic lectin-like β-jelly roll in which a single ligand-binding site comprises a shallow cleft on the concave surface of the protein. In CBM4 and CBM2, variation in ligand recognition between different members of these families is reflected in the structure of this conserved binding site (9Boraston A.B. Nurizzo D. Notenboom V. Ducros V. Rose D.R. Kilburn D.G. Davies G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Although two xylan binding CBM6s from Clostridium thermocellum Xyn11A (CtCBM6) and a Clostridium stercorarium putative xylanase (CsCBM6-3) also display a β-jelly roll fold with a potential ligand-binding site (cleft B) on the concave surface, a second possible binding site (cleft A) is located on one edge of the protein between the loops that connect the inner and outer β-sheets (21Czjzek M.

Mutagenesis, structural, and NMR studies revealed that in CtCBM6 and CsCBM6-3 only cleft A binds ligand, whereas cleft B is unable to interact with carbohydrates, as it appears to be partially occluded by a proline-containing loop in both CBMs (21Czjzek M.

It was proposed that the variation in the location of the functional binding site(s) in the different members of this family may contribute to the diversity of ligand specificity observed within CBM6, which contains proteins that bind to cellulose and xylan (21Czjzek M. Bolam D.N. Mosbah A. Allouch J. Fontes C.M. Ferreira L.M. Bornet O. Zamboni V. Darbon H. Smith N.L. Black G.W. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol.

To test this hypothesis a biochemical (this study) and structural approach (accompanying paper, Ref. 25Pires V.M.R. Henshaw J. Prates J.A.M. Bolam D. Ferreira L.M.A. Fontes C.M.G.A. Henrissat B.

The data show that the protein can accommodate β1,4- and β1,3-linked glucans in cleft A and B and that the two binding sites mediate binding to insoluble cellulose. Only cleft B, however, interacts with β1,3-β1,4-mixed linked glucans such as lichenan and barley β-glucan, supporting the hypothesis that the two potential binding clefts contribute to the variation in ligand specificity observed within the CBM6 family. Source of Carbohydrates Used—All oligosaccharides and polysaccharides were purchased from Megazyme International (Bray County Wicklow, Ireland), except oat spelt xylan and hydroxyethylcellulose, which were obtained from Sigma, and cello-oligosaccharides, which were from Seikagaku Corp. (Japan). Acid-swollen cellulose was prepared from Avicel (PH101; Serva) as described previously (27Wood T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 160: 19-25Crossref Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—The regions of the CmCel5A gene (cel5A; Ref. 26Fontes C.M. Clarke J.H. Hazlewood G.P. Fernandes T.H. Gilbert H.J. Ferreira L.M. Appl. Microbiol.

The reverse primer contains the cel5A stop codon. The amplified DNA was digested with NdeI and XhoI (restriction sites, shown in bold, were incorporated into the two primers) and cloned into the similarly restricted expression vector pET28a to generate pCF1. CmCBM6-2, encoded by pCF1, contains an N-terminal His6 tag. To express CmCBM6-2 the Escherichia coli strain Tuner (Novagen), harboring pCF1, was cultured in Luria Bertani broth containing 10 μg ml-1 kanamycin at 37 °C to mid-exponential phase (A600 ∼0.3). The temperature was then reduced to 16 °C, and when the absorbance had reached 0.7 isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 200 μm, and the cultures were incubated for a further 16 h. Cell-free extracts were then prepared, and recombinant Cm- CBM6-2 was purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography using TALON resin (Clontech) as described previously (22Xie H.

The method was essentially as described by Freelove et al. (28Freelove A.C. Bolam D.N. White P. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43010-43017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) using the polysaccharide ligands at a concentration of 0.1% (w/v), and electrophoresis was carried out for 4 h. The non-binding protein, which was used as a negative control, was bovine serum albumin. When CmCBM6-2 bound to a polysaccharide ligand it could be visualized as a tight, but very slow migrating band, whereas in the gels lacking ligand (or ligand that the protein did not interact with) the CBM ran as a smear making it difficult to visualize. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—ITC measurements were made following standard procedures (20Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Turkenburg J.P. Gilbert H.J. Ferreira L.M. Davies G.J. Fontes C.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5013-5021Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) using a Microcal Omega titration calorimeter. The proteins were dialyzed extensively against 50 mm Na-HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, 5 mm CaCl2, and the ligand was dissolved in the same buffer to minimize heats of dilution. During a titration experiment the protein sample stirred at 300 rpm in a 1.4331-ml reaction cell was injected with 25-50 successive 10-μl aliquots of polysaccharide (5-20 mg ml-1) or oligosaccharide (7.5-20 mm) ligand at 200-s intervals. The molar concentration of CmCBM6-2-binding sites present in the polysaccharide ligands was determined as described previously (31Szabo L. Jamal S. Xie H. Charnock S.J. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49061-49065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Integrated heat effects, after correction for heats of dilution, were analyzed by nonlinear regression using a single-site binding model (Microcal Origin, Version 5.0). The fitted data yield the association constant (KA), number of binding sites on the protein (n), and the enthalpy of binding (ΔH). Other thermodynamic parameters were calculated using the standard thermodynamic equation-RTln KA = ΔG = ΔH-TΔS. Titrations were carried out in triplicate for most ligands, and the errors are the S.D. of the mean of these replicates. Binding to Insoluble Polysaccharides—Qualitative assessment of binding to insoluble cellulose was carried out as follows: 200 μl of a 250 μg ml-1 solution of CmCBM6-2 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl and 5% (v/v) Tween 20 (Buffer A) was mixed with 2 mg of insoluble polysaccharide. The reaction mixture was incubated on ice for 1 h with occasional mixing, after which the insoluble cellulose was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 2 min. The supernatant, comprising the unbound fraction, was removed, and all samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 12.5% gel. Controls with protein but no cellulose were included to ensure that no precipitation occurred during the assay period. Depletion isotherms to quantify the binding of wild type and mutants of CmCBM6-2 to both acid-swollen cellulose and Avicel were carried out as follows: protein (250 μl in Buffer A) at concentrations between 1 and 100 μm was added to 0.25 mg of cellulose and incubated on ice for 1 h with gentle mixing. The polysaccharide was then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 1 min, and the A280 of the supernatant was measured to quantify the amount of free protein remaining after binding. Bound protein was calculated from the total minus the free. Controls with protein but no cellulose were included to ensure that no precipitation occurred during the assay period. The data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using a standard one-site binding model (GraphPad Prism, v2.01), and the Bmax (amount of CBM bound at saturation) and KA values were obtained from the regressed isotherm data. At least three separate binding isotherms were carried out for each protein.

To evaluate the ligand binding specificity of CmCBM6-2, the protein module was expressed in E. coli and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity (Fig. 1). Affinity gel electrophoresis, Table II, shows that CmCBM6-2 binds to the β1,4-β1,3-mixed-linked glucans lichenan and barley β-glucan and the β1,3-glucan laminarin but does not display significant affinity for poorly substituted or highly decorated xylans, pectins such as polygalacturonic acid or rhamnogalacturonan I, potato or pectic β1,4-galactan, sugar beet arabinan, locust bean or carob galactomannan, and konjac glucomannan.Table IILigand specificity of wild type and mutants of CmCBM6-2, determined by affinity gel electrophoresisProteinPolysaccharideBindingaBinding was evaluated by affinity gel electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Polysaccharide was added to the ligand gel at a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v), and bovine serum albumin was used as the non-binding negative control.Wild typeBarley β-glucan+b+, binding; −, no binding.Wild typeLichenan+Wild typeLaminarin+Wild typeHydroxyethylcellulose−b+, binding; −, no binding.Wild typeKonjac glucomannan−Wild typeCarob galactomannan−Wild typeOat spelt xylan−Wild typeWheat arabinoxylan−Wild typeLinear α1,5-arabinan−Wild typePotato β1,4-galactan−Wild typeXyloglucan−Wild typeRhamnogalacturonan I−Wild typePolygalacturonic acid−Y33AcMutation in cleft A.Barley β-glucan+Y33AcMutation in cleft A.Lichenan+Y33AcMutation in cleft A.Laminarin+W92AcMutation in cleft A.Barley β-glucan+W92AcMutation in cleft A.Lichenan+W92AcMutation in cleft A.Laminarin+33A/W92AcMutation in cleft A.Barley β-glucan+W92A/Y33AcMutation in cleft A.Lichenan+W92A/Y33AcMutation in cleft A.Laminarin+W39AdMutation in cleft B.Barley β-glucan−W39AdMutation in cleft B.Lichenan−W39AdMutation in cleft B.Laminarin+E73AdMutation in cleft B.Barley β-glucan−E73AdMutation in cleft B.Lichenan−E73AdMutation in cleft B.Laminarin+Q13AdMutation in cleft B.Barley β-glucan+Q13AdMutation in cleft B.Lichenan+Q13AdMutation in cleft B.Laminarin+K114AdMutation in cleft B.Barley β-glucan+K114AdMutation in cleft B.Lichenan+K114AdMutation in cleft B.Laminarin+a Binding was evaluated by affinity gel electrophoresis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Polysaccharide was added to the ligand gel at a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v), and bovine serum albumin was used as the non-binding negative control.b +, binding; −, no binding.c Mutation in cleft A.d Mutation in cleft B. Open table in a new tab ITC was used to quantify the interaction of CmCBM6-2 with its target ligands. Representative titrations that can be deconvoluted to give thermodynamic and binding parameters are displayed in Fig. 2, and the full data set is presented in Table III. ITC data that could only provide qualitative information on the binding of some ligands because the affinities were too low to obtain sigmoidal titration curves, are displayed in Table IV, and examples of these titrations are provided in the Supplemental Fig. 1. CmCBM6-2 binds to β1,3-β1,4 and mixed-linked β1,4-β1,3-glucans, and to xylooligosaccharides (Table III and Fig. 2) with affinities that are similar to most Type B CBMs from mesophilic microorganisms (29Xie H.

The stoichiometry for the binding of CmCBM6-2 to cellohexaose is close to 1:2, indicating that the protein module contains two distinct ligand-binding sites that can each accommodate this oligosaccharide. The isotherms, however, display only one obvious binding event, and the data fit a single-site model well, suggesting that the two sites are non-interacting and have similar affinities for cellohexaose. It was not possible, therefore, to deconvolute the ITC data (for the wild type protein) to determine the individual affinity for the oligosaccharide ligand at each discrete binding site.

https://openalex.org/W2112291343,"The results of recent studies using selective agonists for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor β (PPARβ) suggest that this receptor may have a role in regulating levels of serum lipids in animal models of obesity and insulin resistance. To further examine this possibility, serum lipid profiles of mice lacking a functional PPARβ receptor were determined. PPARβ-null mice maintained on either normal chow or a 10-week high fat (HF) diet, a condition that has been shown to induce insulin resistance and obesity in mice, have elevated levels of serum triglycerides primarily associated with very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) with no difference in either total cholesterol or phospholipids. Consistent with this finding, PPARβ-null mice on a HF-diet were shown to have an increased rate of hepatic VLDL production as well as lowered lipoprotein lipase activity in serum compared with wild-type controls. The latter parallels an increase in the hepatic expression of the genes encoding angiopoietin-like proteins 3 and 4 in PPARβ-null mice on a HF diet, both proteins of which have recently been shown to inhibit lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in vivo. Consistent with elevated VLDL production, a marked increase in plasma VLDL apoB48, -E, -AI, and -AII, as well as a sharp depletion of the hepatic lipid stores was also found in PPARβ-null mice. In addition, PPARβ-null mice on a HF diet were shown to have increased adiposity, despite lower total body weight. Together, these results indicate a clear role for PPARβ in regulating levels of serum triglycerides in mice on a high fat Western diet by modulating both VLDL production and LPL-mediated catabolism of VLDL-triglycerides and also suggest a potential therapeutic role for PPARβ in the improvement of serum lipids in the setting of metabolic syndrome.

Compared with PPARα and PPARγ, relatively little is known about the function of PPARβ (27Antonucci T. Whitcomb R. McLain R. Lockwood D. Norris R.M.

For example, PPARβ may be involved in keratinocyte proliferation in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate treatment of skin (33Michalik L. Desvergne B. Tan N.S. Basu-Modak S. Escher P.

PPARβ was also suggested to be involved in the regulation of embryo implantation in the mouse (34Lim H. Gupta R.A. Ma W.G. Paria B.C. Moller D.E. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. Trzaskos J.M. Dey S.K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PPARβ is regulated by adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) through β-catenin (35He T.C. Chan T.A. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Cell. 1999; 99: 335-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Apart from these functions, it was suggested that PPARβ plays an important role in improving serum lipid profiles in both rodent and monkey species. For instance, a PPARβ agonist, L-165041, was shown to raise plasma cholesterol concentrations in insulin-resistant db/db mice primarily associated with HDL particles, while having no effect on either glucose or triglycerides (36Leibowitz M.D. Fievet C. Hennuyer N. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Duez H. Bergera J. Cullinan C.A. Sparrow C.P. Baffic J. Berger G.D. Santini C. Marquis R.W. Tolman R.L. Smith R.G. Moller D.E. Auwerx J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). L-165041 also reduced LPL activity in white adipose tissue (WAT). In addition, a potent and selective PPARβ agonist, GW501516, produced a dose-dependent rise in serum HDL-cholesterol, concomitant with a reduction in the levels of small-dense LDL, fasting triglycerides, and fasting insulin in obese rhesus monkeys (37Oliver Jr., W.R.

GW501516 was also shown to promote reverse cholesterol transport by increasing the expression of ABCA1 in macrophages, fibroblasts, and intestinal cells as well as inducing apoA1-specific cholesterol efflux (37Oliver Jr., W.R.

Although reasons for discrepancies in the effects of these PPARβ agonists are not entirely clear, their beneficial effects on serum lipids indicate a potential for use in the treatment of patients with the so-called “metabolic syndrome,” marked by traits such as obesity, insulin resistance, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertriglyceridemia. To further examine potential roles of PPARβ receptor in serum lipid regulation, levels of serum lipids were determined in mice lacking a functional PPARβ receptor (32Peters J.M. Lee S.S. Li W. Ward J.M. Gavrilova O. Everett C. Reitman M.L. Hudson L.D. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5119-5128Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). In this report, it is shown that PPARβ-null mice on a HF diet are hypertriglyceridemic as a result of elevated levels of serum triglycerides primarily associated with very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). These results indicate that this phenotype may primarily be due to increased VLDL production and decreased catabolism of VLDL triglycerides by LPL in the absence of PPARβ. Animals and Diet—Homozygous PPARβ-null male mice and their control wild-type littermates on a C57Bl6/N background were housed in a pathogen-free facility under standard 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and were allowed water ad libitum. 8- to 12-week-old animals were maintained on either a control diet containing 5% fat (CD) (NIH-07 diet; Zeigler Bros, Inc., Gardeners, PA) or placed for 10 weeks on an AIN-93G-modified 35% high fat (HF) diet (F4048, Bio-Serv, Frenchtown, NJ). Measurement of Plasma Lipids and Lipoproteins—Fasting plasma samples were collected at 0, 6, and 10 weeks after initiation of the HF diet. After a 4-h fast, blood was obtained from the retro-orbital plexus of mice anesthetized with methoxyflurane (Pitman-Moore, Mundelheim, IL), placed into pre-cooled tubes containing EDTA (final concentration 4 mm) and centrifuged at 2500 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Plasma aliquots were stored at –70 °C. Total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TGs) (Sigma), as well as free cholesterol (FC) and phospholipid (PL) (Wako, Osaka, Japan) concentrations were measured in 12-μl aliquots of plasma using commercial kits and the Hitachi 911 automated chemistry analyzer (Roche Applied Science). Plasma free fatty acids (FFA) were measured using the NEFA C kit (Wako Chemicals, Richmond VA). Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) separation of serum lipoproteins from pooled plasma samples (100 μl; n = 5) was achieved by gel filtration using two Superose 6HR 10/30 columns (Amersham Biosciences) in series as previously described (38Hayhurst G.P. Lee Y.H. Lambert G. Ward J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Hepatic TG and TC Assay—For liver TG and TC concentrations, total lipids were extracted as follows. Hepatic TG and TC were extracted from 0.1 g of liver and homogenized in 1 ml of 0.1 m KCl. In a new tube, 50 μl of homogenates was diluted by adding 50 μl of 0.1 m KCl, and 0.375 ml of chloroform:methanol (1:2) was then added. Following vortexing, the mixture was kept at room temperature for 5 min. 0.125 ml of chloroform was put in this tube and vortexed. Next, 0.125 ml of water was added followed by vortexing again. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min, the organic layer was separated into another tube. For complete extraction of liver lipid, an additional extraction was repeated using 100 μl of chloroform. Lipids dissolved in organic solvents were dried down and re-suspended in the enzymatic kit buffers prior to TG and TC assays performed using kits (Sigma) as described above. In Vivo TG Production and Lipoprotein Lipase and Hepatic Lipase Activities—Mice were injected with tyloxapol (500 μg/g body weight; Sigma). Plasma VLDL/Chylomicron-TG clearance in mice is completely inhibited under these conditions. Blood samples were taken from each mouse at 0, 30, 90, and 150 min after injection. The accumulation of newly synthesized VLDL/Chylomicron-TG was measured in plasma aliquots. Post-heparin plasma lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL) activities were assayed in triplicate using 14C-labeled triolein substrate in 5 m and 1 m NaCl as previously described (39Iverius P.H. Brunzell J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 249: E107-E114PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of Hepatic Glycogen Content—Hepatic glycogen was purified from whole liver according to an earlier report (40Russell J.C. Tougas D. Taylor A.W. Clin. Chem. 1970; 16: 900-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Frozen tissue samples (50–150 mg) were digested in a suitable volume of 30% KOH for 10 min at 100 °C. Digestion was completed by the addition of one-fifth volume of 20% NaSO4. Macromolecules were precipitated by the addition of two volumes of absolute ethanol and overnight incubation at 20 °C. Macromolecules were washed with 70% ethanol and dried, and glycogen was then hydrolyzed by digestion in 500 μl of 4 n sulfuric acid for 10 min at 100 °C. Samples were then neutralized with the addition of an equivalent volume of 4 n NaOH. The glucose resulting from glycogen hydrolysis was measured using an enzymatic kit (Sigma). Western Blot Analysis—Mouse apolipoproteins (apos), apoA-I, apoA-II, apoE, and apoB were identified in the FPLC fractions by Western blotting using polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse IgG raised against the purified apolipoproteins, as previously described (41Sinal C.J.

Strickland). Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from the livers, epididymal white adipose, and muscle of PPARβ-null and wild-type control mice by the acidic guanidine isocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method using the Ultraspec RNA isolation system (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX). Total RNA was quantitated by optical densitometry at 260 nm and subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel containing 7% formaldehyde in 20 mm MOPS, 8 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA buffer (pH 7.0) and transferred to Gene Screen Plus hybridization transfer membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). The cDNA probes used for Northern blotting included bifunctional enzyme, acyl-CoA oxidase, and thiolase (43Rao M.S. Reddy J.K.

The probes for apoAV, angiopoietin-like protein 3 (Angptl4), angiopoietin-like protein 4 (Angptl3), and 36B4 cDNAs were amplified from a mouse liver cDNA library using gene-specific primers and cloned into pCR TOPO II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The identity of the probes was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The intensities of hybridizing mRNAs were quantified by using ImageQuaNT and normalized to levels of β-actin mRNA. Elevated Plasma TG and FFA Levels in PPARβ-null Mice— On a normal chow diet, PPARβ-null mice were shown to exhibit elevated plasma TG and FFA but similar TC, FC, and PL levels compared with their wild-type controls (Table I). Following a HF dietary challenge for a period of 10 weeks, PL, TC, and FFA levels were dramatically increased but not significantly different between PPARβ-null and control mice. However, TG levels remained significantly elevated in PPARβ-null mice compared with their respective controls (Table I). The results of FPLC analysis indicates that the increase in plasma TG in PPARβ-null mice on a HF diet is primarily due to an increase in plasma VLDL levels, whereas TC FPLC profiles did not differ (Fig. 1). By Western blot analysis, the apolipoprotein content of the VLDL particles was also dramatically increased in PPARβ-null mice; apoB48, apoE, apoA-I, and apoA-II were only detectable in PPARβ-null VLDL (Fig. 1, inset).Table ISerum lipid profiles in PPARβ -null and wild-type miceTCTGPLFCFFANormal chowPPARβ +/+110 ± 3.090.3 ± 7.1222 ± 4.931.5 ± 1.50.82 ± 0.05PPARβ -/-122 ± 5.8132 ± 13232 ± 1129.9 ± 1.51.11 ± 0.07p value0.10<0.010.420.46<0.01High fat dietPPARβ +/+147 ± 7.3154 ± 11292 ± 1435.0 ± 1.61.12 ± 0.05PPARβ -/-172 ± 11227 ± 32334 ± 1739.3 ± 2.41.21 ± 0.07p value0.07<0.050.070.150.33 Open table in a new tab The results of Western blot analysis show a significant increase in the hepatic expression of the LDLr and LRP (the two major receptors for apoB-containing lipoproteins) but not of the HDL receptor SRBI, in PPARβ-null mice compared with controls (Fig. 2). This increase in LDLr and LRP paralleled that of their preferential ligand, apoE, in the plasma of PPARβ-null mice versus controls. PPARβ Deficiency Alters VLDL Catabolism—To elucidate possible mechanisms by which PPARβ deficiency results in increased plasma VLDL-TG levels, mice fed a HF diet for 10 weeks were injected with heparin, and their post-heparin LPL and HL plasma activities measured. Compared with controls, PPARβ-null mice were shown to have a significant decrease in post heparin LPL activity, with no statistically significant change in HL activity (Fig. 3).

Angptl3 and Angptl4 mRNA expression were unchanged in PPARβ-null mice on a normal chow diet (data not shown). On the other hand, consistent with hypertriglyceridemia and lowered LPL activity, the expression of the genes encoding Angptl3 and Angptl4 were elevated in the livers of PPARβ-null mice on a HF diet (Fig. 4). Hepatic expression of the gene encoding apoCIII, another major inhibitor of LPL, was unchanged in PPARβ-null mice (Fig. 5A).Fig. 4Northern blot analysis of total RNA from liver of wild-type (+/+) and PPARβ-null (–/–) mice on a HF diet.

https://openalex.org/W2150862082,"AMP and adenosine are found in all cell types and can be released by cells or created extracellularly from the breakdown of ATP and ADP. We have identified an orphan G protein-coupled receptor with homology to the P2Y family of nucleotide receptors that can respond to both AMP and adenosine. Based on its ability to functionally bind the nucleotide AMP, we have named it P2Y15. Upon stimulation, P2Y15 induces both Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization and cyclic AMP generation, suggesting coupling to at least two different G proteins. It is highly expressed in mast cells and is found predominantly in the tissues of the respiratory tract and kidneys, which are known to be affected by AMP, adenosine, and adenosine antagonists. Until now, the effects of AMP have been thought to depend on its dephosphorylation to adenosine but we demonstrate here that P2Y15 is a <i>bona fide</i> AMP receptor by showing that it binds [<sup>32</sup>P]AMP. Because AMP and adenosine have bronchoconstrictive effects that can be inhibited by theophylline, we tested whether theophylline and other adenosine receptor antagonists can block P2Y15. We found inhibition at a theophylline concentration well within the therapeutic dose range, indicating that P2Y15 may be a clinically important target of this drug."
https://openalex.org/W2005368084,"Factor V, the precursor of factor Va, circulates in plasma with little or no procoagulant activity. Activity is generated following limited proteolysis indicating that the conversion of factor V to factor Va results in appropriate structural changes, which impart cofactor function. We have produced recombinant partial B-domain-truncated derivatives of factor V (FVdes811-1491 and FVdes811-1491 with Arg709 and Arg1545 mutated to Gln) to investigate whether discrete proteolysis within the B-domain followed by a conformational transition is responsible for activation. Direct binding fluorescence measurements as well as steady-state kinetic assays were employed to assess the ability of these factor V derivatives to assemble and function in prothrombinase. In contrast to human factor V, single-chain B-domain-truncated factor V bound to FXa membranes with an affinity that was identical to factor Va. Additionally, it was found that, once this modified derivative was assembled in prothrombinase, it functioned in an equivalent manner to factor Va. Taken together these data support the hypothesis that proteolysis within the B-domain of factor V, although necessary, is incidental to the mechanism by which cofactor function is realized. Instead, our results are more consistent with the interpretation that proteolytic activation of factor V simply eliminates steric and/or conformational constraints contributed by the B-domain that otherwise interfere with discrete binding interactions that govern the eventual function of factor Va.

The generation of thrombin at the appropriate time and place is crucial for balancing normal hemostasis and thrombosis. Thrombin is formed subsequent to proteolysis of two peptide bonds in prothrombin by the macromolecular enzyme complex prothrombinase, which assembles through reversible interactions between the serine protease factor Xa (FXa), 1The abbreviations used are: FXa, activated FX; FX, factor X; PD-FV, plasma-derived factor V; FVa, activated FV; rFVa, recombinant factor Va; rFV-DT, recombinant factor V with amino acids 811-1491 deleted from the B-domain; rFV-DTQQ, rFV-DT with Arg709 and Arg1545 mutated to Gln; PAR, protease-activated receptor; OG488-FXa, human FXa modified with Oregon Green-488; BHK, baby hamster kidney; PCPS, small unilamellar vesicles composed of 75% (w/w) phosphatidylcholine and 25% (w/w) phosphatidylserine; DAPA, dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide; S2238, H-d-phenylalanyl-l-pipecolyl-l-arginyl-p-nitroanilide; APMSF, 4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride; ITS, insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite; FPR-CH2Cl, d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone. 1The abbreviations used are: FXa, activated FX; FX, factor X; PD-FV, plasma-derived factor V; FVa, activated FV; rFVa, recombinant factor Va; rFV-DT, recombinant factor V with amino acids 811-1491 deleted from the B-domain; rFV-DTQQ, rFV-DT with Arg709 and Arg1545 mutated to Gln; PAR, protease-activated receptor; OG488-FXa, human FXa modified with Oregon Green-488; BHK, baby hamster kidney; PCPS, small unilamellar vesicles composed of 75% (w/w) phosphatidylcholine and 25% (w/w) phosphatidylserine; DAPA, dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide; S2238, H-d-phenylalanyl-l-pipecolyl-l-arginyl-p-nitroanilide; APMSF, 4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride; ITS, insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite; FPR-CH2Cl, d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-l-arginine chloromethyl ketone. and the cofactor protein factor Va (FVa), on a suitable membrane surface in the presence of Ca2+ ions (1Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P.E. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Factor Va is essential for the rapid generation of thrombin, and its removal from this enzyme complex profoundly reduces the rate of prothrombin activation (2Mann K.G. Kalafatis M. Blood. 2002; 101: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The precursor of FVa is factor V (FV), a large (Mr = 330,000) heavily glycosylated, single-chain, multidomain (A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2) protein, which is synthesized in the liver and is homologous to factor VIII (2Mann K.G.

Thrombin is established as the most robust activator of FV (2Mann K.G. Kalafatis M. Blood. 2002; 101: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Proteolysis occurs at Arg709, Arg1018, and Arg1545 generating FVaIIa, a heterodimer composed of an N-terminal 105-kDa heavy chain associated via Ca2+ ions to the C-terminal 74/71-kDa light chain (6Suzuki K.

The large, heavily glycosylated B-domain, spanning amino acids 710-1545, is not necessary for cofactor activity and is released during activation (9Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 964-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which FV is maintained in an inactive state is not well understood. It is also not clear how macromolecular binding sites on the heavy and/or light chains are expressed following thrombin-mediated proteolysis. At least two mechanisms could underlie these processes. One possibility, drawn from the known mechanism of serine protease zymogen, protease-activated receptor (PAR), and fibrinogen activation, implies that discrete proteolysis followed by the release of a new N terminus and a conformational change accounts for activation (12Khan A.M. James M.N.G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 13Coughlin S.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar, 14Doolittle R.F. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 1559-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Support for this mechanism comes from studies using either recombinant FV or proteolyzed derivatives of FV, which demonstrate that cleavage at Arg1545 is sufficient for activation and that release of the B-domain from the heavy chain is not necessary for expression of cofactor activity (6Suzuki K.

A second possibility, employed by proteins such as aspartic and cysteine proteases, implies that the prosegment or activation peptide sterically blocks functional binding sites and activation results from the removal of these sequences (12Khan A.M. James M.N.G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Elimination of these steric sequences can be achieved by proteolysis, changes in pH, covalent modification, or noncovalent interactions with regulatory factors (20Kobe B. Kemp B.E.

This FV derivative is secreted as a single-chain protein and appears to have constitutive but partial activity of 30-38% compared with FVa. However, the findings with this derivative also suggest an important role for discrete proteolysis, because full activity was only obtained following cleavage by thrombin or RVV-V (factor V activator from Russell's viper venom). Numerous reports have attempted to correlate bond cleavage in FV with the generation of cofactor activity (9Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

Most of these studies have largely relied on functional measurements with thrombin generated in situ. This complicates interpreting the requirements for cofactor activation, because it is difficult to eliminate feedback proteolysis of FV. Additionally, it has been recognized that assay conditions can influence the conclusion as to which fragments of FV(a) are considered active further complicating interpretations (24Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 620-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These potential shortcomings suggest limitations to the current understanding of the relationship between specific proteolysis in FV and the development of cofactor activity. In the current study we have expressed recombinant B-domain-truncated derivatives of FV and have used a series of physical and kinetic measurements to assess the role of B-domain sequences in contributing to the mechanism by which FV is maintained as a procofactor. Materials—Benzamidine, aprotinin, and 4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (APMSF) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). S2238 (H-d-phenylalanyl-l-pipecolyl-l-arginyl-p-nitroanilide) was purchased from Diapharma Group, Inc.

Human plasma-derived FVa (PD-FVa) was prepared by proteolytic activation of PD-FV by thrombin and purified as described previously (31Kalafatis M. Krishnaswamy S. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 224-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Prethrombin-2 was prepared by proteolysis of human prothrombin and purified by established procedures (32Mann K.G. Elion J. Butkowski R.J. Downing M. Nesheim M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 286-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Traces of thrombin were depleted from prethrombin-2 preparations by chromatography on benzamidine-Sepharose. Oregon Green488-human FXa (OG488-FXa) was prepared as described (29Buddai S.K.

Human thrombin and a monoclonal antibody directed against the light chain of FVa were purchased from Hematologic Technologies (Essex Junction, VT). The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit used for FV detection was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories Inc. (South Bend, IN). Molecular weights and extinction coefficients (E280 nm0.1%), of the various proteins used were taken as follows: prothrombin, 72,000 and 1.47 (33Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 123-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar); prethrombin-2, 37,500 and 1.95 (33Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 123-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar); thrombin, 37,500 and 1.94 (34Lundblad R.L. Kingdon H.S. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 156-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar); FXa, 45,300 and 1.16 (35Di Scipio R.G. Hermodson M.A. Yates S.G. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 698-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar); and based on measurements in the present study, PD-FVa, 173,000 and 1.78; rFVa, 175,000 and 1.78; and rFV-DT, 216,000 and 1.54. Construction of Recombinant FVdel811-1491 (rFV-DT)—The FV cDNA in the pMT2 expression plasmid was purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The cDNA was digested with SalI and subcloned into the pED expression vector, which was a generous gift from Dr. Monique Davis (Genetics Institute) (36Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Wasley L.C. Michnick D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4485-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). A partial B-domainless derivative of FV, FVdel811-1491, was constructed using the technique of splicing by overlap extension (37Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar). This derivative has FV cDNA sequences corresponding to amino acids 811-1491 from the B-domain deleted. Specific oligonucleotides used were as follows: primer A, 5′-GAAGAGGTGGGAATACTT-3′ corresponds to the cDNA sequence coding for amino acid residues 319-325; primer B, 5′-CTCAATGTAATCTGTATCCTCTATAGGGTC-3′ in which the first 15 bases correspond to cDNA sequence coding for residues 1496-1492 and the last 15 bases correspond to cDNA sequence coding for residues 810-806; primer C, 5′-GACCCTATAGAGGATACAGATTACATTGAG-3′ in which the first 15 bases correspond to cDNA sequence coding for residues 806-810 and the last 15 bases correspond to cDNA sequence coding for residues 1492-1496; and primer D, 5′-TCTGTCCATGATAAGAAATGG-3′ corresponds to the FV cDNA sequence coding for residues 1877-1871. The resulting 2632-bp fragment was digested with Bsu36I and SnaBI, gel purified, and sub-cloned into pED-FV digested with the same enzymes. To ensure the absence of polymerase-induced errors, the entire modified FV cDNA was sequenced. This rFV derivative has been previously described by Kane et al. (21Kane W.H. Devore-Carter D. Ortel T.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 6762-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the protein product has Asp810 fused to Thr1492 and was thus renamed to rFV-DT based on the nomenclature used in the FVIII field (38Sandberg H. Almstedt A. Brandt J. Gray E. Holmquist L. Oswaldsson U. Sebring S. Mikaelsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A rFV-DT mutant with Arg709 and Arg1545 replaced by Gln (rFVDTQQ) was generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using two complementary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation, the sense strand for the R709Q mutation being 5′-CTGCAGCATTAGGAATTCAGTCATTCCGAAACTCATC-3′ and for the R1545Q mutation 5′-GCAGCATGGTACCTCCAGAGCAACAATGGAAACAG-3′. Expression and Purification of rFV-DT—Factor V expression plasmids were introduced into baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and pSV2neo as the selectable marker plasmid. Approximately 8 days later, 48 G418-resistant colonies from each construct were selected for expansion in 24-well plates. Following an initial screen for FV clotting activity, high producers were placed in T25 flasks and screened for protein production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and clotting activity. Protein expression levels of the clones varied from 0.5 to 4.0 μg/106cells/24 h. Selected clones were expanded into triple flasks (Nalge-Nunc, Naperville, IL) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 media supplemented with ITS, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 1.0 mg/ml Albumax (Invitrogen). Conditioned media was collected for 4-6 days, centrifuged, and stored at -20 °C in the presence of protease inhibitors (10 mm benzamidine, 10 μm APMSF). Three liters of conditioned media was thawed at 37 °C followed by the addition of protease inhibitors (10 μm APMSF, 1 μm FPR-CH2Cl, 0.5 ml/liter aprotinin). The media was loaded onto an anti-human FVSepharose column equilibrated in 20 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine, pH 7.4. The column was washed with 20 mm Tris, 0.35 m NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine, pH 7.4, and then eluted with 20 mm Tris, 1.65 m NaCl, 1 mm benzamidine, pH 7.4. Fractions containing FV activity were pooled, dialyzed versus 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm Ca2+, pH 7.4, and concentrated by ultrafiltration (Millipore). The final yield was ∼2 mg of rFV-DT/liter of conditioned media, and the purified protein was stored at -80 °C. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE using pre-cast 4-12% gradient gels (Invitrogen) under reducing conditions followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Purification of rFVa—Purified rFV-DT (3 μm, 10 mg) was incubated with 10 nm α-thrombin at 37 °C for 15 min followed by the addition of 10 μm FPR-CH2Cl. Following activation of rFV-DT, rFVa was purified by ion exchange chromatography as described (31Kalafatis M. Krishnaswamy S. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 224-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Molecular weights were determined in a Beckman Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge using interference optics. Sedimentation velocity was measured at 20 °C with a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, at 40,000 rpm with an AN60Ti rotor. Sedimentation coefficients and molecular weights were determined by g(s*) analysis (39Stafford W.F. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Extinction coefficients were determined by differential refractometry by the procedure described by Babul and Stellwagen (40Babul J. Stellwagen E. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 28: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). FV-specific PT-based Clotting Assay—Factor V/Va (200 nm) derivatives were prepared in 20 mm Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.5 (assay buffer). For experiments in which pretreatment with thrombin was intended, samples (200 nm) were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with 2 nm thrombin, followed by the addition of 3 nm hirudin. Samples were then diluted to less than 1 nm in assay buffer with 0.1% albumin, and specific clotting activity using FV-deficient plasma was performed as described (18Camire R.M. Kalafatis M. Tracy P.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11896-11906Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Intensity Measurements—Samples (2.5 ml) in assay buffer were maintained at 25 °C in 1- × 1-cm2 stirred quartz cuvettes, and steady-state fluorescence intensity was measured using λex = 480 and λem = 520 nm with a long pass filter (KV500, Schott, Duryea, PA) in the emission beam. Measurements, including controls, were performed essentially as described (29Buddai S.K. Toulokhonova L. Bergum P.W. Vlasuk G.P. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26689-26698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 41Betz A. Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10709-10718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Kinetics of Macromolecular Substrate Cleavage—Initial velocities of prethrombin-2 or prothrombin cleavage by prothrombinase were determined discontinuously at 25 °C as described (42Krishnaswamy S. Walker R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 43Camire R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37863-37870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Progress curves of prethrombin-2 activation were performed using the following reaction conditions: PCPS (50 μm), DAPA (3 μm), and prethrombin-2 (1.4 μm) were incubated with the various cofactors (3.0 nm) in assay buffer, and the reaction was initiated with FXa (3.0 nm). At various time points, aliquots of the reaction mixture were quenched, thrombin generation was determined by using the chromogenic substrate S2238, and samples were also prepared for Western blotting analysis (see below). Dissociation constants (Kd) for FXa binding to membrane-bound cofactor were determined using the following reaction conditions: PCPS (50 μm), DAPA (3 μm), and prethrombin-2 (1.4 μm) were incubated with various concentrations (0.3-18 nm) of cofactor in assay buffer, and the reaction was initiated with FXa (5 nm). The kinetic parameters of prothrombinase-catalyzed prothrombin or prethrombin-2 activation (Km and Vmax) were determined as follows: using prothrombin as a substrate, PCPS (50 μm), and the various cofactors (20 nm) were incubated with increasing concentrations of prothrombin (0-5 μm), and the reaction was initiated with FXa (0.1 nm); using prethrombin-2 as a substrate, assay mixtures contained PCPS (50 μm), cofactor (20 nm), and various concentrations of prethrombin-2 (0-20 μm), and the reaction was initiated with FXa (5 nm). Western Blot and Densitometric Analysis—Recombinant FV-DTQQ (20 ng) was subjected to SDS-PAGE (4-12% gradient gel) and then electroblotted to nitrocellulose at 30 V for 1 h. The membrane was probed with a monoclonal antibody directed against the FVa light chain as previously described (18Camire R.M. Kalafatis M. Tracy P.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11896-11906Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The secondary antibody used was a goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). Visualization of bands was performed by photographic detection of enhanced chemiluminescence using film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). The film was imaged with transmitted light using a Kodak DC290 digital camera, and the bands were analyzed with the image analysis program Image J, Version 1.30v (National Institutes of Health). The exposure times and aperture settings for the imaging step were selected to yield a linear densitometric response. Data Analysis—Data were analyzed according to the referenced equations by nonlinear least squares regression analysis using the Marquardt algorithm (44Bevington P.R. Robinson K.D. Data Reduction and Error Analysis for the Physical Sciences. McGraw-Hill, New York1992Google Scholar). The qualities of the fits were assessed by the criteria described (45Straume M. Johnson M.L. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 87-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Fitted parameters are reported ± 95% confidence limits. Dissociation constants (Kd) and stoichiometries (n) for the interaction between FXa and membrane-bound FVa were obtained from the dependence of the fluorescence intensity or initial rate of prethrombin-2 activation on the concentrations of cofactor (46Krishnaswamy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3708-3718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initial velocity measurements of macromolecular substrate (prothrombin or prethrombin-2) cleavage by prothrombinase were analyzed by fitting the data to the Henri-Michaelis-Menten equation (47Segal I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady State Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar), to yield fitted values for Km and Vmax. Expression and Purification of rFV-DT and rFV-DTQQ—Recombinant FV-DT and rFV-DTQQ were expressed in BHK cells and purified to homogeneity by immunoaffinity chromatography with typical yields of ∼2 mg/liter. SDS-PAGE analyses (Fig. 1) indicated that rFV-DT and rFV-DTQQ migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 200,000. Recombinant FV-DT was completely processed to rFVa following incubation with thrombin, whereas rFV-DTQQ was not significantly cleaved. Plasma-derived FV (PD-FV) and PD-FVa used in this study as controls are included on the gel. Recombinant FVa (rFVa) used as an additional control was purified following treatment of rFV-DT with thrombin and migrated on the gel in a manner similar to PD-FVa. Physical Characterization of Recombinant Proteins—Sedimentation velocity studies were conducted to assess hydrodynamic molecular weights, extinction coefficients as well as homogeneity (Table I). The data obtained for PD-FVa and rFVa agreed well with published reports for bovine FVa (48Mann K.G. Hockin M.F. Begin K.J. Kalafatis M. J. Biol.

This is in sharp contrast to other xylan-binding CBMs, which interact in a calcium-independent manner with both xylo-oligosaccharides and decorated xylans. The plant cell wall comprises the most abundant source of renewable carbon on the planet. This extensive resource is made available to the biosphere through the action of microbial glycoside hydrolases, which are thus of considerable biological and industrial importance. Plant cell walls are composed of a complex network of polysaccharides that are highly inaccessible to enzyme attack (1Brett C.T. Waldren K. Black M. Charlewood B. Physiology and Biochemistry of Plant Cell Walls. Topics in Plant Functional Biology. Chapman and Hall, London1996Google Scholar). Glycoside hydrolases that degrade the plant cell wall are generally modular enzymes comprising catalytic and non-catalytic modules that are joined via flexible linker sequences. Many of these non-catalytic modules bind to specific oligo- and polysaccharides derived from the plant cell wall and are thus defined as carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs, 1The abbreviations used are: CBMs, carbohydrate-binding modules; Abf62A, arabinofuranosidase 62A; Est1A, acetyl xylan esterase 1A; Man5C, mannanase 5C; GH, glycoside hydrolase family; DGM, degalactosylated mannan; AGE, affinity gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IMAC, immobilized metal affinity chromatography; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ORF, open reading frame; TCEP, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine.1The abbreviations used are: CBMs, carbohydrate-binding modules; Abf62A, arabinofuranosidase 62A; Est1A, acetyl xylan esterase 1A; Man5C, mannanase 5C; GH, glycoside hydrolase family; DGM, degalactosylated mannan; AGE, affinity gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; IMAC, immobilized metal affinity chromatography; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ORF, open reading frame; TCEP, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)-phosphine.

Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Bioengineering. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1999: 202-211Google Scholar). By localizing the appended catalytic module onto the surface of the (mainly) insoluble polysaccharide substrates, CBMs potentiate the activity of glycoside hydrolases against these composite structures (3Bolam D.N.

Thus, CBMs play a pivotal role in the capacity of glycoside hydrolases to degrade the plant cell wall. Based on sequence similarities, CBMs have been grouped into families (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/, Ref. 5Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert J.J. Davies G. Henrissat B. Svensson B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Bioengineering. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1999: 3-12Google Scholar). Currently there are 34 CBM families, 32 of which contain modules from prokaryotic enzymes whereas only families 1 and 29 contain fungal proteins (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/, Ref. 5Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert J.J. Davies G. Henrissat B. Svensson B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Bioengineering. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1999: 3-12Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures of representatives of over half of the CBM families demonstrate that these proteins generally adopt a β-jelly roll fold (2Boraston A.B. McLean B.W. Kormos J. Alam M.M.

McLean B.W. Kormos J. Alam M.M. Gilkes N.R. Haynes C.A. Tomme P. Kilburn D.G. Warren R.A. Gilbert H.J. Davies G.J. Henrissat B. Svensson B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Bioengineering. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1999: 202-211Google Scholar). While lectins contain multiple binding sites that interact with mono- or disaccharides of complex carbohydrates (14Lis H. Sharon N. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 637-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar), CBMs generally contain a single binding site that accommodates 5–6 saccharide units (13Boraston A.B. Nurizzo D.

Although all Type A or B CBMs characterized to date are monovalent (contain only one binding site), co-operativity between multiple CBMs in a single enzyme can lead to significant increases in affinity compared with the individual modules (16Linder M.

Ligand specificity in Type A CBMs is generally invariant, while in the Type B modules polysaccharide recognition is variable within a family and normally reflects the catalytic activity of the enzyme from which it is derived (10Charnock S.J.

Biol. 2002; 319: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition to known CBMs, plant cell wall hydrolases often contain non-catalytic modules of unknown function. This is exemplified by three plant cell wall-degrading enzymes from Cellvibrio japonicus, Xyn10B (xylanase), Abf62A (arabinofuranosidase), and Est1A (acetyl xylan esterase) that contain an identical ∼150-amino acid module, termed X4, whose role in enzyme function is unclear (19Ferreira L.M. Wood T.M. Williamson G. Faulds C. Hazlewood G.P. Black G.W. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Kellett L.E. Poole D.M. Ferreira L.M. Durrant A.J. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This X4 module is also present in a mannanase (Man5C) from the same organism (21Hogg D. Pell G. Dupree P. Goubet F. Martin-Orue S.M. Armand S. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 1027-1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism by which glycoside hydrolases attack the complex composite structure that comprises the plant cell wall requires knowledge of the function of all the components of these modular enzymes. In this report we show that the X4 module of unknown function in four C. japonicus enzymes is also present in a range of other glycoside hydrolases. The two different Cellvibrio X4 modules bind to the polysaccharide that is the substrate of the cognate enzyme, and thus these proteins represent a new family of CBMs, designated CBM35. The CBM appended to Abf62A requires calcium for binding, a feature that has not been observed previously in CBMs. Bacterial Strains, Culture Conditions, and Plasmids—The Escherichia coli strains Tuner (Novagen), C41 (DE3, a gift from Prof. A. R. Fersht at the Medical Research Council, Cambridge, UK), JM83 (DE3), and JM83 were used in this study. The plasmid vectors used were pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences), pRSET (Invitrogen), pET16b, and pET22b (Novagen), while the recombinant plasmids and the proteins they encode are shown in Fig. 1. To generate pDB1, encoding Abf62A-CBM35, the region of the cognate gene, abf62A comprising nucleotides 457–945 was amplified by PCR using the primers: 5′-GCGGGATCCTCTTCTGCATCCAGTGTGGCC-3′ and 5′-GCGGAATTCTTAACTTGATGAGGAGGATGACG-3′, which contain BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively, and the resultant DNA fragment was cloned into BamHI/EcoRI-restricted pRSET. The plasmid pDB2, encoding GST-Abf62A-CBM35, was produced by cloning the same region of abf62A present in pDB1 into BamHI/EcoRI-digested pGEX-2T. The plasmid pGP1, encoding Man5C-CBM35, was generated by amplifying nucleotides 589–981 of man5C using the primers 5′-GCGCATATGATGGCAGTACCGGAAGGC-3′and 5′-GCGCTCGAGGGCTGGCGAGCGGATGGTC-3′, which contain NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively, and the resultant DNA was cloned into similarly restricted and pET22b. Construction of pDH25 encoding the glycoside hydrolase family 5 (GH5) catalytic module of Man5C was described previously (21Hogg D. Pell G. Dupree P. Goubet F. Martin-Orue S.M. Armand S. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 1027-1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmid pDH26, which encodes Man5C-CBM35-GH5, was generated by amplifying the region of man5C comprising nucleotides 589–2495 using the primers 5′-GCGCATATGATGGCAGTACCGGAAGGC-3′ and 5′-GCGGGATCCTTATTGCATCAGCGACCGG-3′, which contain NdeI and BamHI restriction sites, respectively. The amplified DNA was digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned into similarly restricted pET16b. In pDB1, pDH25, and pDH26 the encoded protein module is appended to an N-terminal His tag, while in pGP1 the encoded CBM35 module has a C-terminal His tag. In pDB2 the encoded Abf62A-CBM35 is fused to the C terminus of GST. Expression and Purification of C. japonicus Proteins in E. coli—To generate the proteins encoded by recombinants of pET16b and pRSET, the E. coli strains Tuner or C41 harboring pDH26 and pDB1, respectively, were cultured in LB supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin (1000 ml in 2-liter conical baffle flasks) at 37 °C and 180 rpm to mid-exponential phase (OD600 nm ∼0.6). The culture was then cooled to 16 °C, before expression of CBM35 was induced by addition of isopropyl β-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of either 0.1 mm for C41 cells or 0.2 mm for Tuner cells and incubation at 16 °C for a further 15 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and resuspended in one-fiftieth volume 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm NaCl before lysis by sonication and centrifugation (25,000 × g) for 15 min at 4 °C to produce cell-free extract. The CBM35 proteins were purified from cell-free extract by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) as described previously (22Xie H. Gilbert H.J. Charnock S.J. Davies G.J. Williamson M.P. Simpson P.J. Raghothama S. Fontes C.M. Dias F.M. Ferreira L.M. Bolam D.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9167-9176Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) using Talon™ resin (Clontech). To generate Man5C-CBM35, JM83 (DE3) harboring pGP1 was grown, and recombinant protein was purified as described above except that the expression of the recombinant protein was induced at 37 °C for 3 h using a final concentration of 1 mm IPTG. To produce GST-Abf62A-CBM35, E. coli JM83 containing pDB2 was cultured as described above except that expression of the recombinant protein was induced at 30 °C for 4 h using a final IPTG concentration of 0.5 mm. The GST fusion protein was purified from cell-free extract by glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) affinity chromatography as described previously (23Xie H. Bolam D.N. Nagy T. Szabo L. Cooper A. Simpson P.J. Lakey J.H. Williamson M.P. Gilbert H.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5700-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined from the calculated molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm, which were 60,700 m–1 cm–1, 19,700 m–1 cm–1, 30,440 m–1 cm–1, 126,670 m–1 cm–1 and 96,230 m–1 cm–1 for GST-Abf62A-CBM35, Abf62A-CBM35, Man5C-CBM35, Man5C-CBM35-GH5, and GH5 alone, respectively. Sources of Sugars Used—All oligosaccharides and polysaccharides were purchased from Megazyme International, except glucuronoxylan, birchwood xylan, oat-spelt xylan, and hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), which were obtained from Sigma. Bacterial microcrystalline cellulose, acid swollen cellulose, and the soluble and insoluble fractions of oat-spelled xylan were prepared as described previously (24Simpson P.J. Xie H. Bolam D.N. Gilbert H.J. Williamson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41137-41142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To generate insoluble degalactosylated mannan (DGM), 0.5 g of carob galactomannan (high viscosity, galactose/mannose = 1:4) was treated with 10 units of C. japonicus α-galactosidase Gal27A (25Halstead J.R. Fransen M.P. Eberhart R.Y. Park A.J. Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 192: 197-203PubMed Google Scholar) in 10 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 37 °C for 18 h. Removal of the galactose side chains caused the mannan chains to aggregate and become insoluble. The precipitated mannan was washed extensively in distilled water. The monosaccharide content of the insoluble DGM polysaccharide, determined by acid hydrolysis followed by HPLC, revealed that the ratio of galactose/mannose was 1:50. Affinity Gel Electrophoresis (AGE)—AGE was performed as described previously (26Takeo K. Electrophoresis. 1984; 5: 187-195Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) using oat-spelt xylan (arabinose/xylose = 1:10), rye arabinoxylan (high viscosity; arabinose/xylose = 1:1), 4-O-methylglucuronoxylan, birchwood xylan (glucuronic acid/xylose = 1:10; Ref. 27Glaudemans C.P.J. Timell T.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1958; 43: 941Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar), barley β-glucan (medium viscosity), hydroxyethylcellulose, konjac glucomannan (low viscosity; glucose/mannose = 2:3), carob galactomannan (low viscosity; galactose/mannose = 1:4), debranched α1,5-arabinan (sugar beet), β1,4-galactan (potato), and rhamnogalacturonan (soy bean) as ligands. The ratio of sugars in each polysaccharide was provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, the continuous gels contained 7.5% (w/v) acrylamide in 25 mm Tris, 250 mm glycine buffer, pH 8.3. For ligand-containing gels, glycan was added to the separating gel mixtures to 0.01–5 mg/ml prior to polymerization. Native polyacrylamide gels, with and without ligand, were polymerized at the same time and were electrophoresed in the same gel tank. The proteins (5 μg) were electrophoresed at 25 °C and 10 mA/gel in gels with and without ligand for 2 h. GST was used as a negative, non-interacting control. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. The migration distances of the CBMs and the reference protein were measured from the bottom of the protein bands evident on the gels, and these data were used to determine the dissociation constants (KD) from plots of 1/(R0 – r) versus 1/C according to the affinity equation shown in Equation 1,1/(R0−r)=1/(R0−RC)(1+KD/C)(Eq. 1) where r is the relative migration distance of the CBM in the presence of ligand in the gel, R0 is the relative migration distance of the free CBM in the absence of ligand, RC is the relative migration distance of the complex at high excess of ligand where all CBM molecules are fully complexed, C is the concentration of the ligand in the gel, and KD is the dissociation constant of CBM for the macromolecular ligand. KD values were determined as the inverse of the absolute value of the intercept on the abscissa of data plotted according to the affinity equation. All migration distances of the CBMs were measured relative to the migration of the reference protein GST. Creation of the Apo Form of Abf62A-CBM35—Purified Abf62A-CBM35 at a concentration of 400 μm in 50 mm sodium HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, was passed through a 20 × 1.5-cm column containing a 10-ml bed volume of Chelex-100 (Sigma) under the flow of gravity. The buffer used for ITC was treated in the same way to remove any traces of calcium. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Gel filtration was performed using a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) attached to a Bio-Rad Biologic HR FPLC system. The column was calibrated using Sigma gel filtration molecular weight markers ranging from 12.4 to 66 kDa. Blue dextran (2 MDa) was used to determine the column void volume. Protein (1 ml) was loaded on the column and run at 1 ml/min in 50 mm sodium HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, for 120 min. Where appropriate the reducing agent Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) was added to the sample and the running buffer at a final concentration of 1 mm. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—ITC measurements were made at 25 °C using a Microcal Omega titration calorimeter. The Man5C-CBM35 and Abf62A-CBM35 modules were dialyzed extensively against 50 mm sodium HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, and the ligands were dissolved in the same buffers to minimize heats of dilution. Where appropriate, TCEP, calcium, or EDTA at final concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 mm, respectively, were added to Abf62A-CBM35 and carbohydrate ligand prior to ITC. During a titration experiment, the protein sample (150–600 μm), stirred at 300 rpm in a 1.4331-ml reaction cell maintained at 25 °C, was injected with 25–50 successive 10-μl aliquots of ligand comprising polysaccharide (5–25 mg/ml) or oligosaccharide (5–15 mm), at 200-s intervals. The apo form of Abf62A-CBM35 (150 μm) was titrated against 3 mm calcium chloride to determine whether calcium bound independently to the protein. Prior to the titration the cell was washed out with 5 mm EDTA, followed by an extensive Chelex-treated buffer wash to remove any traces of the metal ion from the machine. Integrated heat effects, after correction for heats of dilution, were analyzed by non-linear regression using a single site-binding model (Microcal Origin, version 5.0). Fitted data yield the association constant (KA) and the enthalpy of binding (ΔH). Other thermodynamic parameters were calculated using the standard thermodynamic equation:–RTlnKA = ΔG = ΔH – TΔS. The c values (product of the association constant × the concentration of the acceptor × the number of binding sites on the acceptor) were 3–30. At least two independent titrations were performed for each ligand tested. The molar concentration of Man5C-CBM35 binding sites present in galactomannan and glucomannan was determined by altering the concentration of polysaccharide used for regression of the isotherm until the fit yielded a value of 1 for n (number of binding sites on each molecule of CBM). The assumption that n = 1 was based on the oligosaccharide titrations, which all displayed a stoichiometry of 1:1. For analysis of the xylan binding data with Abf62A-CBM35, this approach could not be used because the CBM did not interact with xylo-oligosaccharides. Instead, the binding data was fitted by treating the CBM in the sample cell as the ligand and the polysaccharide as the acceptor. This gives accurate values for KA and ΔH, but not n (in this case the number of binding sites on each molecule of polysaccharide). Binding to Insoluble Polysaccharides—The binding of the CBM35 proteins to insoluble polysaccharides (acid-swollen cellulose, bacterial microcrystalline cellulose, DGM, ivory nut mannan, and insoluble oat-spelt xylan) was determined qualitatively using SDS-PAGE. Pure protein (100 μg in 20 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8.0) was mixed with 2 mg of polysaccharide in a final volume of 100 μl. Tubes were incubated on ice for 1 h, with regular gentle mixing before being centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 1 min and the supernatant, containing unbound protein, carefully removed. The polysaccharide pellet was then washed in 100 μl of the same buffer, before being resuspended in 50 μl of 10% (w/v) SDS and boiled for 10 min to dissociate any bound protein. Controls with protein but no polysaccharide were included to insure that no precipitation occurred during the assay period. Bound and unbound fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 12.5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. Enzyme Assays—The mannanase activity of the Man5C derivatives Man5C-CBM35-GH5 and GH5 was evaluated by HPLC with mannohexaose, ivory nut mannan or insoluble DGM as substrates using equal concentrations of protein. The Man5C derivatives (50 nm) were incubated with 5 mg/ml ivory nut mannan or insoluble DGM in 50 mm sodium phosphate/12 mm citrate (PC) buffer, pH 6.5 at 37 °C for up to 5 h in a total volume of 0.5 ml. At regular time intervals, a 40-μl aliquot was removed, the enzyme was inactivated by boiling for 10 min, and mannotetraose, the primary reaction product, was quantified by HPLC following the method of Hogg et al. (21Hogg D. Pell G. Dupree P. Goubet F. Martin-Orue S.M. Armand S. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 1027-1043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the rate of mannohexaose hydrolysis, the hexasaccharide (0.6 mm) was incubated with 40 nm enzyme in PC buffer, pH 6.5 at 37 °C for up to 30 min in a total volume of 0.4 ml, and the release of mannotetraose was quantified as described above. Identification of the CBM35 Family of Protein Modules— Previous studies identified a protein module, originally termed X4, comprising ∼150 amino acids in three C. japonicus enzymes, Xyn10B (formerly XynB), Abf62A (formerly XynC), and Est1A (formerly XynD) that are involved in the hydrolysis of xylan. All three enzymes contain an identical N-terminal region that comprises a typical family 2a CBM joined via a serine-rich linker to the X4 module (19Ferreira L.M. Wood T.M. Williamson G. Faulds C. Hazlewood G.P. Black G.W. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 349-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 20Kellett L.E. Poole D.M. Ferreira L.M. Durrant A.J. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). As the X4 modules in these Cellvibrio enzymes are shown to bind polysaccharides (see below), henceforth these sequences will be designated as a new family of CBMs (family 35, CBM35). When the primary structure of Abf62A-CBM35 was used to query databases using BLAST, a number of sequences that display similarity to this sequence were identified in enzymes that modify carbohydrates, including glycoside hydrolases and lyases that attack the hemicellulosic and pectic polysaccharides, respectively, within the plant cell wall. Based on sequence similarities the CBM35 modules can be group into three clads containing modules derived from xylan/pectin-modifying enzymes, mannanases, and isomalto-oligosaccharide-modifying enzymes, respectively. The alignment of the CBM35s and phylograms of this family are displayed in Fig. 2. It should be noted that while CBM35 constitutes a discrete protein family, it displays a distant relationship with family 6 CBMs. The observation that CBM35s lack the three aromatic residues (e.g. Trp-92, Tyr-33, and Trp-39 in CBM6–2 from Cellvibrio mixtus Cel5A), which play a pivotal role in ligand recognition by CBM6 proteins (28Henshaw J. Bolam D.N. Pires V.M. Czjzek M. Henrissat B. Ferreira L.M. Fontes C.M. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21552-21559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), provides further support for the view that CBM35 and CBM6 comprise discrete families of CBMs.Fig. 2Alignment of CBM35 modules (panel A) and phylograms (panels B and C).

https://openalex.org/W2077124345,"Heparin affin regulatory peptide (HARP) is an heparin-binding molecule involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation. Here, we report that HARP inhibited the biological activity induced by the 165-amino-acid form of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF165) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Endothelial-cell proliferation induced by VEGF165 showed about 50% inhibition in the presence of HARP in a concentration of 3 nM. In similar range of concentrations, HARP blocked tube formation induced by VEGF165 in three-dimensional angiogenesis assay. In vivo studies showed that HARP inhibited the VEGF165-induced Matrigel trade mark infiltration of endothelial cells. We then investigated the mechanisms of this inhibition and shown that HARP inhibited the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to the VEGF receptors of endothelial cells. Additional studies using VEGF soluble receptors indicated that binding of 125I-VEGF165 to kinase insert domain-containing receptor and neuropilin receptor was inhibited by HARP, but conversely the binding of 125I-VEGF165 to fms-like tyrosine kinase I receptor was unaffected. A competitive affinity-binding assay demonstrated that HARP interacted directly with VEGF165 with a dissociation coefficient of 1.38 nM. Binding assay using deletion mutants of HARP revealed that the thrombospondin type-1 repeats domains were involved in this interaction. These data demonstrate for the first time that the angiogenic factor HARP can also negatively regulates the angiogenic activity of VEGF165."
https://openalex.org/W2155354341,Many descriptions of evolutionary adaptations are criticized as “just-so stories” (1) that are based more on intuition than on direct tests of adaptive hypotheses. The elaborate crowns of horns possessed by many species of horned lizards (genus Phrynosoma) are classic examples of intuitively adaptive features that lack direct tests of function. The bony horns that give horned lizards their name are presumed to function as a defense against predators (Fig. 1B). Here we present data from the wild showing that natural selection by loggerhead shrikes favors longer horns (fig. S1) in the flat-tailed horned lizard (Phrynosoma mcalli).
https://openalex.org/W2083110543,"In 1994, the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV/HHV-8) was identified as the etiologic agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). KSHV has since been associated with two additional AIDS-related malignancies: primary effusion lymphomas (PEL) and multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). Although molecular characterization of the KSHV genome has revealed several candidate oncogenes, infection with KSHV alone is not sufficient to cause KS, suggestive of an accomplice in KS initiation. Recent experimental evidence supports a key role for a particular KSHV gene, a constitutively-active G-protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR), in the development of KS. However, it is unclear how a lytic gene expressed in cells destined to die can cause cancer. Here we propose that dysregulation of the viral gene program may lead to nonlytic vGPCR expression. Several candidate cofactors (e.g., HIV-1 Tat, inflammation, aborted lytic cycle progression) are identified that may trigger vGPCR dysregulation, enabling oncogenic signaling pathways up-regulated by vGPCR, combined with the paracrine secretions from vGPCR-expressing cells, to promote the initiation of KS. If KS is indeed dependent on vGPCR dysregulation, then the development of new therapeutic modalities specifically targeting this viral protein or its downstream targets may ultimately prove to be the most effective treatment strategy for this enigmatic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2035789545,"Mixed-lineage kinase 3 (MLK3) is a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase that activates MAPK pathways, including the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 pathways. MLK3 and its family members have been implicated in JNK-mediated apoptosis. A survey of human cell lines revealed high levels of MLK3 in breast cancer cells. To learn more about MLK3 regulation and its signaling pathways in breast cancer cells, we engineered the estrogen-responsive human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, to stably, inducibly express FLAG epitope-tagged MLK3. FLAG·MLK3 complexes were isolated by affinity purification, and associated proteins were identified by in-gel trypsin digestion followed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Among the proteins identified were heat shock protein 90α,β (Hsp90) and its kinase-specific co-chaperone p50cdc37. We show that endogenous MLK3 complexes with Hsp90 and p50cdc37. Further experiments demonstrate that MLK3 associates with Hsp90/p50cdc37 through its catalytic domain in an activity-independent manner. Upon treatment of MCF-7 cells with geldanamycin, an ansamycin antibiotic that inhibits Hsp90 function, MLK3 levels decrease dramatically. Furthermore, tumor necrosis factor α-induced activation of MLK3 and JNK in MCF-7 cells is blocked by geldanamycin treatment. Our finding that geldanamycin treatment does not affect the cellular levels of the downstream signaling components, MAPK kinase 4, MAPK kinase 7, and JNK, suggests that Hsp90/p50cdc37 regulates JNK signaling at the MAPK kinase kinase level. Previously identified Hsp90/p50cdc37 clients include oncoprotein kinases and protein kinases that promote cellular proliferation and survival.

Our findings reveal that Hsp90/p50cdc37 also regulates protein kinases involved in apoptotic signaling. Signal transduction processes invariably involve protein-protein interactions. The accumulation of knowledge regarding cell signaling over the past several years has led to an appreciation for the idea that supramolecular signaling complexes exist within cells and that the cellular environment is highly organized. Knowledge of the components of signaling complexes is important in understanding signaling processes. Methods such as the yeast two-hybrid system are often useful for characterizing binary interactions, but are of limited utility in defining multicomponent complexes. Recently, affinity purification of protein complexes and identification of their components using mass spectrometry has become feasible. The mixed-lineage kinases (MLKs) 1The abbreviations used are: MLKs, mixed-lineage kinases; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; MAPKKKs, MAPK kinase kinases; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MKK4, MAPK kinase 4; TNF α, tumor necrosis factor-α; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding; MS, mass spectrometry; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; LC/MS/MS, liquid chromatography tandem MS; CID, collision-induced dissociation; HEK, human embryonic kidney; 17-AAG, 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin. are a family of seven mammalian serine/threonine kinases that function as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinases (MAPKKKs) to activate the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway (1Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 663-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In some experimental settings, the MLKs may also activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), p38 MAPK, and NF-κB pathways (1Gallo K.A. Johnson G.L. Nat. Rev. Mol.

MLK3 activates the JNK pathway through phosphorylation and activation of the dual specific kinases, MAPK kinase 4 (MKK4) (8Rana A. Gallo K. Godowski P. Hirai S. Ohno S. Zon L. Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J.

JNKs and p38 MAPKs are activated by diverse extracellular stimuli, including cytokines, osmotic stress, UV light, and heat shock (13Johnson G.L. Lapadat R. Science. 2002; 298: 1911-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (3542) Google Scholar). However, it has been demonstrated that more than a dozen MAPKKKs activate the JNK and p38 pathways. The signals that specifically activate endogenous MLK3 are not well characterized. Recently, it has been shown that treatment of Jurkat T lymphocytes with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) activates endogenous MLK3, as judged by the ability of MLK3 to phosphorylate recombinant MKK4 in vitro (14Sathyanarayana P.

In addition to its catalytic domain, MLK3 contains an aminoterminal Src-homology 3 domain, a centrally located zipper region, and a Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) motif, which mediate protein-protein interactions to regulate MLK3 activity and/or signaling. The small Rho family GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac, in their activated states, bind to MLK3 in a CRIB motif-dependent manner and increase MLK3 catalytic activity (15Bock B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Previous work in our lab has shown that MLK3 is autoinhibited through an interaction between its amino-terminal Src-homology 3 domain and a sequence located between its zipper and CRIB motifs (16Zhang H. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45598-45603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) has surfaced as a popular tool to fish out protein complexes. Several groups have successfully applied a one-step purification procedure using an anti-FLAG antibody-bound resin to capture FLAG-tagged protein complexes (17Westermarck J. Weiss C. Saffrich R.

To better understand the regulation and signaling of MLK3, we employed the FLAG affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry to identify proteins that interact with MLK3. We report the identification of the molecular chaperones Hsp90/p50cdc37 as MLK3 binding partners. The work described herein demonstrates the functional importance of the complex formation with Hsp90/p50cdc37 on the stability and signaling of MLK3. Chemicals and Antibodies—Geldanamycin and other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The phospho-c-Jun (KM-1) mouse monoclonal antibody, MKK4 rabbit polyclonal antibody, MKK7 goat polyclonal antibody, JNK rabbit polyclonal antibody, Hsp90 rabbit polyclonal antibody, p50cdc37 mouse monoclonal antibody, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) mouse monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Other antibodies used were the MLK3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (15Bock B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol.

Plasmid Constructs and Mutagenesis—Construction of mammalian expression vectors for wild-type MLK3 (pRK5-NFLAG.mlk3), MLK3 K144A, the MLK3 truncation variant (pCGN-HA mlk3 115–399), and pGST-p50cdc37 have been described elsewhere (16Zhang H.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Two other HA-tagged MLK3 variants were constructed by PCR using the following oligonucleotides with pRK5-NFLAG.mlk3 as the template: pCGN-HA. mlk3 1–399, 5′-CGTTAGTCTAGAATGGAGCCCTTGAAGAG-3′ and 5′-GCATTAGGATCCTCACCAGCCTTCCTGCATGG-3′; pCGN-HA.mlk3 400–847, 5′-CGTTAGTCTAGAAAGCGCGAGATCCAGGG-3′ and 5′-GCATTAGGATCCTCAAGGCCCCGCTTCCGGC-3′. The amplified mlk3 fragments were subcloned in-frame with the HA coding sequence into the pCGN mammalian expression vector using XbaI and BamHI. The bacterial expression vector of GST-MKK7, kindly provided by Dr. Roger Davis (University of Massachusetts Medical School), was used as a template to create the kinase-defective mutant GST-MKK7 K165A using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene). Generation of an MCF-7 Cell Line Inducibly Expressing MLK3—A cell line inducibly expressing MLK3 was generated using the ARGENT regulated transcription system (Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). A BamHI-XhoI fragment, containing the G418 resistance (neo) gene, was subcloned from pIRESneo2 vector (Clontech) into the pC4 N2-RH S3H-ZF3 plasmid vector (Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). The pC4 N2-RH S3H-ZF3 neo plasmid was transfected into MCF-7 cells, and clones were selected in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 400 μg/ml G418 (Sigma). Individual clones were maintained in the same medium containing 40 μg/ml G418. The target gene vector pLH-Z12 I-PL-FLAG-mlk3 was constructed by PCR-mediated amplification of the corresponding coding sequence from pRK5-FLAG-mlk3 followed by subcloning into the target gene vector at the HindIII and ClaI sites. The pLH-Z12 I-PL-FLAG-mlk3 plasmid was transfected into a stable MCF-7 clone derived from the selection described above. Clones were selected in the same medium containing 40 μg/ml G418 and 50 μg/ml hygromycin for about 2 weeks. Individual clones were tested for inducible expression of FLAG·MLK3 after growth in the presence of 50 nm AP21967 for 20 h. Individual clones inducibly expressing FLAG·MLK3 were maintained in normal medium containing 40 μg/ml G418 and 10 μg/ml hygromycin. The clone MCF-7/iFLAG-MLK3 was used for further studies. Isolation of FLAG·MLK3 Complexes—MCF-7/iFLAG-MLK3 cells (1 × 108) were cultured in the presence of 100 nm AP21967 for 20 h to induce FLAG·MLK3 expression. An equal number of cells were cultured in the absence of AP21967 as a negative control. Cells were disrupted in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm Na4PPi, 100 μm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma). Clarified cellular lysates were incubated with 400 μl of anti-FLAG M2 agarose gel (Sigma) for 90 min at 4 °C. The resin was collected by centrifugation and was washed with Tris-buffered saline three times. FLAG·MLK3 complexes were eluted from the resin by incubation for 60 min at 4 °C with 300 ng/μl 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline and acetone precipitated. The precipitated proteins were redissolved in water and loading buffer and resolved by gel electrophoresis on 4–12% gradient gels (NuPage, Invitrogen). In-gel Trypsin Digestion—Visible protein bands were excised from the Coomassie-stained gel and chopped into 1-mm3 pieces. Proteins contained in gel pieces were reduced with 10 mm dithiothreitol and then alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide. The gel pieces were dehydrated with 100% acetonitrile and dried using a Speed-Vac. After digestion with sequencing-grade trypsin (13 ng/μl; Promega) at 37 °C overnight, tryptic peptides were extracted with 60% acetonitrile/1% trifluoroacetic acid and were completely dried. The dried sample was reconstituted by the addition of 8 μl of 1% formic acid. Nanoelectrospray Liquid Chromatography/Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)—LC/MS/MS was performed on a Finnigan LCQ-Deca mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan, San Jose, CA). A portion of the tryptic peptides (typically 6 μl out of a 12-μl sample) was loaded onto a peptide capillary trap (Michrom); after washing the trap with 1% aqueous formic acid, the trap was connected to a C18 PicoFrit column (NewObjectives, 75-μm inner diameter × 5 cm), and peptides were eluted with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (5–60%) in 1% formic acid. The Top3 mode was used to obtain the MS/MS data during collision-induced dissociation (CID). The SEQUEST software version 2 (Turbo-Sequest; Thermo Finnigan) performed in silico tryptic digestion of proteins in the NCBI Protein Database, calculated their possible CID fragments, and compared the latter with the experimentally determined CID spectra of MLK3-associated proteins for purposes of identification. Cell Lines and Transfections—MCF-7 cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). MCF-7 cells were pretreated for 24 h with 5 μm geldanamycin or with Me2 SO. Cells were then treated with TNFα for the indicated periods of time, harvested, and lysed as described previously (16Zhang H. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45598-45603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A portion of the cells was pelleted and boiled in SDS-loading buffer and used for Western blotting of the phospho-c-Jun level. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in Ham's F-12/low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1:1) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. HEK 293 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method as described previously (15Bock B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 16 h after transfection and lysed as described previously (16Zhang H. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45598-45603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). GST Pulldown Assays—Mammalian constructs (pGST or pGST-p50cdc37) encoding GST or GST-p50cdc37, respectively, were cotransfected with expression vectors encoding MLK3 truncation variants in HEK 293 cells. Cells were lysed and 400 μl of the clarified lysate were incubated with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (Amersham Biosciences) for 90 min at 4 °C. The pelleted resin was washed twice with HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol), and bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitations—Clarified lysates were incubated with antibody-bound protein A-agarose for 90 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Na3VO4). In Vitro Kinase Assays—Immunoprecipitated MLK3 was incubated in 20 μl of kinase assay buffer containing 10 μm ATP, 5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 6 μg of recombinant GST-MKK7 K165A for 30 min at room temperature. After the kinase assay, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and the incorporation of radioactivity into the GST-MKK7 was quantitated by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics). The membrane was Western blotted with MLK3 antibody and GST antibody sequentially to determine the MLK3 and GST-MKK7 levels. SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Lysates and GST pulldowns of proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and Western blotted using appropriate antibodies. Western blots were developed by the chemiluminescence method as described previously (15Bock B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Inducible Expression of MLK3 in MCF-7 cells—Because Western blotting of cellular lysates revealed that MLK3 is expressed at high levels in breast cancer cell lines (data not shown), MCF-7 cells were chosen as a source for MLK3-interacting proteins. To establish a reliable system for affinity purification of MLK3 complexes, MCF-7 cells were engineered to inducibly express FLAG-tagged MLK3 using the ARGENT system (Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) wherein transcription of a specified gene is controlled by the small molecule dimerizer AP21967 (20Pollock R. Giel M. Linher K. Clackson T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We refer to this inducible cell line as MCF-7/iFLAG-MLK3. As shown in Fig. 1, FLAG·MLK3 was inducibly expressed upon the addition of AP21967. Because MLK3 activates the JNK pathway, the phosphorylation of the transcription factor c-Jun as detected by a phospho-c-Jun-specific antibody was used as a measure of the FLAG·MLK3 activity in vivo. The phosphorylation of c-Jun on Ser63 dramatically increased upon induced expression of FLAG·MLK3 (Fig. 1), indicating that the inducibly expressed FLAG·MLK3 is catalytically active and activates the JNK pathway. Purification of MLK3 Complexes—Inducibly expressed FLAG·MLK3 was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel as described under “Experimental Procedures.” FLAG·MLK3 complexes were eluted by the addition of a peptide consisting of three tandem repeats of the FLAG epitope (3× FLAG peptide) and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue. Uninduced MCF-7/iFLAG-MLK3 cells were used as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 2A, a prominent band representing FLAG·MLK3 is present only in the induced sample. In addition, there are multiple bands present in the induced sample but absent in the uninduced sample, suggesting that these bands represent MLK3-interacting proteins. Identification of p50cdc37 and Hsp90 in MLK3 Complexes— Two prominent Coomassie-stained bands of ∼90 (p90) and 50 kDa (p50) (Fig. 2A) present only in the sample with induced MLK3 expression were subjected to further analysis. These bands were excised from the gel and digested with trypsin. The resulting tryptic peptides were subjected to LC/MS/MS. SEQUEST was used to match MS/MS with proteins in the NCBI Protein Database. Based upon these analyses, the p90 band contained Hsp90α and Hsp90β, and the p50 band contained the Hsp90 co-chaperone p50cdc37. Representative MS/MS data from Hsp90α and p50cdc37 are shown in Fig. 2, B and C, respectively. To verify that Hsp90 and p50cdc37 are present in FLAG·MLK3 complexes, they were isolated as described previously and probed by Western blotting using antibodies directed against Hsp90 and p50cdc37. As expected, both Hsp90 and p50cdc37 are detected in FLAG·MLK3 complexes but not in control samples derived from uninduced MCF-7/iFLAG-MLK3 cells (Fig. 2D). Hsp90 is an evolutionarily conserved heat shock protein that functions as a molecular chaperone to prevent the aggregation and to maintain the homeostasis of client proteins. The client proteins of eukaryotic Hsp90 include steroid hormone receptors and certain protein kinases (reviewed in refs. 21Nollen E.A. Morimoto R.I. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2809-2816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Jolly C. Morimoto R.I. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1564-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). The co-chaperone p50cdc37 is required for the interaction between Hsp90 and its client protein kinases. Endogenous MLK3 Is Associated with Hsp90 and p50cdc37— Although Hsp90 and p50cdc37 are clearly components of FLAG·MLK3 complexes, it is conceivable that the association of FLAG·MLK3 with Hsp90/p50cdc37 may be an artifact resulting from the high expression levels of FLAG·MLK3 in the induced MCF-7/iFLAG-MLK3 cells. However, immunoprecipitates of endogenous MLK3 from MCF-7 cellular lysates contain endogenous Hsp90 and p50cdc37 (Fig. 3). Only a small proportion of the total cellular pool of Hsp90 and p50cdc37 is associated with MLK3 (data not shown). This observation is not surprising as Hsp90 and p50cdc37 are relatively abundant proteins that have multiple client proteins. Hsp90/p50cdc37 Regulate the Level of MLK3 in MCF-7 Cells— Certain ansamycin antibiotics, such as geldanamycin, occupy the ATP/ADP binding pocket of Hsp90 to inhibit its chaperone activities (23Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartl F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar, 24Roe S.M. Prodromou C. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 260-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar) and, as such, often decrease the cellular levels of Hsp90 client proteins. To test whether the stability of MLK3 depends upon the chaperone activity of Hsp90, the impact of geldanamycin treatment on levels of endogenous MLK3 in MCF-7 cells was examined. Indeed treatment of MCF-7 cells for 24 h with increasing concentrations of geldanamycin decreased the levels of MLK3, as judged by Western blotting (Fig. 4A). A concentration of 1 μm geldanamycin is sufficient to trigger the loss of MLK3 in MCF-7 cells. In addition, geldanamycin treatment reduces the amount of cellular MLK3 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). On average, the levels of MLK3 were reduced by more than 80% at 24 h. These results indicate that Hsp90/p50cdc37 regulates the level of endogenous MLK3 in MCF-7 cells and support the supposition that MLK3 is a bona fide client of Hsp90/p50cdc37. Others have noted that Hsp90 inhibitors, including 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) and herbimycin A, induce cell-cycle arrest of MCF-7 cells (25Srethapakdi M. Liu F. Tavorath R. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3940-3946PubMed Google Scholar, 26Munster P.N. Srethapakdi M. Moasser M.M. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2945-2952PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether geldanamycin inhibits MCF-7 cell growth, equal numbers of cells were plated and then treated with 5 μm geldanamycin or Me2SO for 24 h. Based on experiments performed twice in triplicate, there were 51% fewer cells after treatment with 5 μm geldanamycin as compared with controls cells, in accord with previously published reports. Hsp90/p50cdc37 Associates with the Kinase Domain of MLK3—The ability of Hsp90 to interact with and stabilize its client protein kinases depends upon its cochaperone p50cdc37. To determine which domains of MLK3 are responsible for interaction with Hsp90/p50cdc37, the ability of NH2-terminal HA-tagged truncated variants of MLK3 to interact with coexpressed GST-p50cdc37 and endogenous Hsp90 was examined using a GST-pulldown assay. The presence of endogenous Hsp90 and the MLK3 variants in the GST·p50cdc37 complexes was assessed by Western blotting. Data from GST-pulldown assays show that GST-p50cdc37, but not GST, associates with endogenous Hsp90 (Fig. 5A). Only MLK3 1–399, which includes the glycine-rich region, Src-homology 3 domain, kinase domain, and the isolated kinase domain, MLK3 115–399, are present in complexes of GST-p50cdc37/endogenous Hsp90 (Fig. 5A). In contrast, MLK3 400–847 (which includes the zipper region, CRIB motif, and the proline-rich carboxyl-terminal region) fails to interact with GST-p50cdc37/endogenous Hsp90 (Fig. 5A). As expected, none of the MLK3 variants associates with GST. Based on these experiments, we conclude that MLK3 interacts with Hsp90/p50cdc37 through its kinase domain. This conclusion is consistent with the findings that LKB1 (18Boudeau J. Deak M. Lawlor M.A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

The Association of MLK3 with Hsp90/p50cdc37 Is Independent of Its Activity—Because Hsp90/p50cdc37 bind the catalytic domain of MLK3, it is conceivable that the activation state of MLK3 may affect this interaction. We tested the ability of three forms of MLK3 that reflect different activation states to associate with Hsp90/p50cdc37: wild-type MLK3, Cdc42-activated wild-type MLK3, and the kinase-defective MLK3 K144A (15Bock B.C. Vacratsis P.O. Qamirani E. Gallo K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14231-14241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). After transient expression of MLK3 variants with or without activated Cdc42, MLK3 variants were immunoprecipitated, and the presence of endogenous Hsp90 and endogenous p50cdc37 was assessed by Western blotting using appropriate antibodies. As shown in Fig. 6, equal amounts of Hsp90/ p50cdc37 associate with the MLK3 variants under these conditions. These data support the idea that MLK3 activity does not influence its interaction with Hsp90/p50cdc37. Hsp90/p50cdc37 Regulate TNFα-induced Activation and Signaling of MLK3 in MCF-7 Cells—TNFα treatment has been shown to activate endogenous MLK3 in Jurkat T cells (14Sathyanarayana P. Barthwal M.K. Kundu C.N. Lane M.E. Bergmann A. Tzivion G. Rana A. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1527-1533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We examined whether TNFα increases MLK3 activity in MCF-7 cells. After 30 min of treatment with TNFα, endogenous MLK3 was immunoprecipitated, and its activity was assessed by an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant, catalytically inactive GST-MKK7 as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 7, the basal activity of endogenous MLK3 is low. Upon TNFα treatment, the catalytic activity of MLK3 increases about 2.5-fold (Fig. 7, A and B). The activation of endogenous MLK3 coincides with JNK activation in cells, as measured by the phosphorylation of c-Jun (Fig. 7C). These data are consistent with TNFα -induced, MLK3-mediated JNK activation. If TNFα-induced JNK activation involves MLK3, we would expect that geldanamycin treatment should block JNK activation in this setting. MCF-7 cells were incubated with or without geldanamycin for 24 h and then treated with TNFα for 30 min. As shown in Fig. 7, geldanamycin pretreatment abolished the TNFα-induced activation of MLK3. Indeed, under these conditions, TNFα fails to activate JNK. In addition, geldanamycin treatment lowers the basa"
https://openalex.org/W2019067973,"Mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene p53 have been associated with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). Irinotecan (CPT-11), a DNA topoisomerase 1 inhibitor, has been recently incorporated to the adjuvant therapy. Since the DNA-damage checkpoint depends on p53 activation, the status of p53 might critically influence the response to CPT-11. We analysed the sensitivity to CPT-11 in the human colon cancer cell line HT29 (mut p53) and its wild-type (wt)-p53 stably transfected subclone HT29-A4. Cell-cycle analysis in synchronised cells demonstrated the activation of transfected wt-p53 and a p21(WAF1/CIP1)-dependent cell-cycle blockage in the S phase. Activated wt-p53 increased apoptosis and enhanced sensitivity to CPT-11. In p53-deficient cells, cDNA-macroarray analysis and western blotting showed an accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)1/cyclin B complex. Subsequent p53-independent activation of the cdk-inhibitor (cdk-I) p21(WAF1/CIP1) prevented cell-cycle progression. Cdk1 induction was exploited in vivo to improve the sensitivity to CPT-11 by additional treatment with the cdk-I CYC-202. We demonstrate a gain of sensitivity to CPT-11 in a p53-mutated colon cancer model either by restoring wild-type p53 function or by sequential treatment with cdk-Is. Considering that mutations in p53 are among the most common genetic alterations in CRC, a therapeutic approach specifically targeting p53-deficient tumors could greatly improve the treatment outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W1993181710,"We have previously shown that nuclear factor-κB inhibition by adenovirus expressing mutated IκB-α or by proteasome inhibitor increases human articular chondrocytes sensibility to apoptosis. Moreover, the nuclear factor-κB inhibitor BAY11-7085, a potent anti-inflammatory drug in rat adjuvant arthritis, is itself a proapoptotic agent for chondrocytes. In this work, we show that BAY 11-7085 but not the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 induced a rapid and sustained phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) in human articular chondrocytes. The level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation correlated with BAY 11-7085 concentration and chondrocyte apoptosis. 15-Deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and its precursor prostaglandin (PG) D2 but not PGE2 and PGF2α rescued chondrocytes from BAY 11-7085-induced apoptosis. 15d-PGJ2 markedly inhibited BAY 11-7085-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2. BAY 11-7085 also induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and apoptosis in human synovial fibroblasts, and these reactions were down-regulated by 15d-PGJ2. Further analysis in synovial fibroblasts showed that only molecules that suppressed BAY 11-7085-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (i.e. 15d-PGJ2, PGD2, and to a lesser extent, MEK1/2 inhibitor UO126, but not prostaglandins E2 and F2α or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonist ciglitazone) were able protect cells from apoptosis. These results suggested that the antiapoptotic effect of 15d-PGJ2 on chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts might involve inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation.

Synovial tissue proliferation is one of the major detrimental events in rheumatoid disease. Cartilage is a highly specialized tissue that relies on only one cell type, the chondrocyte, and has very limited ability to regenerate (1van der Kraan P.M. Buma P. van Kuppevelt T. van den Berg W.B. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2002; 10: 631-637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Chondrocyte survival is thus crucial for the preservation of cartilage and joint function (2Aigner T. Kim H.A. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 1986-1996Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Many biological functions of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α are mediated by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) or mitogen-activated protein kinases, and deregulation of both pathways is involved in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and OA (3Liacini A. Sylvester J. Li W.Q. Zafarullah M. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Because NF-κB controls the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules, such as cytokines, chemokines, nitric oxide, cyclo-oxygenase 2, metalloproteinases, and adhesion molecules (4Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3426) Google Scholar), its inhibition by the super-repressor IκB, by NF-κB decoys (5Miagkov A.V. Kovalenko D.V. Brown C.E. Didsbury J.R.

NF-κB activity, however, also has a protective role against apoptosis of primary (7Relic B. Bentires-Alj M. Ribbens C. Franchimont N. Guerne P.A. Benoit V. Merville M.P. Bours V. Malaise M.G. Lab.

Commun. 2002; 295: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) chondrocytes. Although the proteasome and NF-κB inhibitor MG-132 merely sensitized chondrocytes to induced apoptosis, NF-κB inhibitor BAY 11-7085 was able to cause chondrocyte apoptosis directly (7Relic B. Bentires-Alj M. Ribbens C. Franchimont N. Guerne P.A. Benoit V. Merville M.P. Bours V. Malaise M.G. Lab. Investig. 2002; 82: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We thus searched for additional pathways triggered by BAY 11-7085 and for an anti-inflammatory molecule able to protect chondrocytes from BAY 11-7085-induced apoptosis. In this study, we showed that, in human primary articular chondrocytes, BAY 11-7085 but not MG-132 induced a sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we showed that BAY 11-7085-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation as well as BAY 11-7085-induced chondrocyte apoptosis can be markedly inhibited by pretreatment with 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2). However, we also showed that 15d-PGJ2 has a pronounced antiapoptotic effect on synovial fibroblasts, suggesting that 15d-PGJ2 could also have pro-inflammatory effects on the cells from human joint. Chondrocyte and Synovial Fibroblast Isolation—Human cartilage was obtained post-mortem from patients who had not been admitted to the hospital for joint diseases (used for experiments presented in Figs. 1, 2, 3), and from OA patients during joint replacement (used for experiments presented in Fig. 4). Cartilage was cut in 1–2-mm3 explants and digested at 37 °C with gentle agitation with, in succession, 0.5 mg/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min, 1 mg/ml pronase (Merck KGaA) for 1 h, and 0.8 mg/ml collagenase IA (Sigma-Aldrich) for 16–20 h. After digestion, cells were filtered through 70 μm nylon membrane (Falcon; BD Biosciences), washed and seeded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) lacking phenol red (Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc., Walkersville, MD) and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS).

For cell isolation, synovium was finely cut and digested 4 or 16 h with 0.5 or 1 mg/ml collagenase IA (Sigma-Aldrich), respectively. Synovial fibroblasts were filtered through 70 μm nylon membrane (Falcon), washed, and seeded in DMEM (Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc.) supplemented with 10% FCS. For experiments, synovial fibroblasts (passages 2–6) were seeded in DMEM supplemented with 1% FCS. Primary endothelial cells from human umbilical vein were purchased from Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc., and maintained in EGM2 medium (Cambrex Bio Science Walkersville, Inc.). Cell Treatment—Isolated chondrocytes were cultured either in 96-well plates at the density of 5 × 104 cells/100 μl of DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS (cell surviving tests) or in 6-well plates at density of 106 cells/1.5 ml (protein extracts analysis).

In some experiments, the proteasome and NF-κB inhibitor MG-132 (Alexis Corporation) was used. Survival Assay—Cell survival was measured as mitochondrial NADH/NADPH-dependent dehydrogenase activity, resulting in the cellular conversion of methyltetrazolium salt MTS (Promega, Madison, WI) into a soluble formazan dye (9Buttke T.M. McCubrey J.A. Owen T.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 157: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). An electron-coupling agent, phenazine methosulfate, was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Colorimetric measurement of formazan dye was performed at 490 nm. Annexin V Labeling—Chondrocytes were seeded in 8-well chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) and pretreated with 15d-PGJ2 for 24 h. BAY 11-7085 was then added for an additional 24 h. Cell supernatant was carefully discarded and chondrocytes labeled with annexin V-FITC using Annexin V fluos staining kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Cell images were captured under fluorescence microscope. Western Blotting—Cells were collected at 4 °C and lysed for 30 min on ice in 100 μl of buffer (25 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing phosphatase inhibitors (1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm NaF). Total proteins (20 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA). Phosphorylated ERK1/2, ERK1/2, and caspase-8 were detected with mouse monoclonal antibodies that recognize phosphorylated Tyr-204 (E4), rabbit polyclonal (K-23) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and rabbit polyclonal antibodies (BD Pharmingen), respectively, diluted 1:1000, in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 supplemented with 10% milk powder. β-Actin was detected with mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich), diluted 1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was detected with mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen) and diluted 1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20. Incubation of membranes with primary antibodies was done at room temperature for 1–3 h. Western blots were revealed with 1:2000 diluted anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies (DakoCytomation Denmark A/S, Glostrup, Denmark) and ECL chemiluminescent reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Statistics—p values were obtained using the Mann-Whitney test and considered significant when lower than 0.05. Bay 11-7085 but Not MG-132 Induces Sustained ERK1/2 Phosphorylation in Human Chondrocytes—We and others showed previously that inhibition of NF-κB by adenovirus-expressing mutated IκB-α or by proteasome inhibitor increases human chondrocyte sensitivity to apoptosis (7Relic B. Bentires-Alj M. Ribbens C. Franchimont N. Guerne P.A. Benoit V. Merville M.P. Bours V. Malaise M.G. Lab. Investig. 2002; 82: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 8Kim A.H. Song W.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, only BAY11-7085, not MG-132 or adenovirus-expressing mutated IκB-α, is itself a proapoptotic agent for chondrocytes. Thus, we searched for a signaling pathway distinct from NF-κB that was involved in BAY 11-7085-induced chondrocyte apoptosis. Results showed that in isolated human articular chondrocytes BAY 11-7085 (Fig. 1A), but not MG-132 (Fig. 1B), induced rapid and sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation. 15d-PGJ2 Protects Chondrocytes from BAY 11-7085-induced Apoptosis and Suppresses BAY 11-7085-induced ERK1/2 Phosphorylation—We showed recently that tumor necrosis factor-α can protect chondrocytes from apoptosis in a cyclo-oxygenase-2-dependent fashion, suggesting that prostaglandins could exert an antiapoptotic action (7Relic B. Bentires-Alj M. Ribbens C. Franchimont N. Guerne P.A. Benoit V. Merville M.P. Bours V. Malaise M.G. Lab. Investig. 2002; 82: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested the effect of prostaglandins on chondrocyte survival in the presence of BAY 11-7085. Chondrocytes were pretreated with PGE2, PGF2α, PGD2, or 15d-PGJ2 for 24 h. Bay 11-7085 was then added for an additional 24 h. 15d-PGJ2 and PGD2 treatment significantly inhibited BAY 11-7085-induced apoptosis, whereas PGE2 and PGF2α did not have protective effect (Fig. 2A). It was interesting that pretreatment of chondrocytes with 15d-PGJ2 drastically inhibited Bay 11-7085-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B), suggesting that suppression of ERK1/2 phosphorylation may rescue chondrocytes from Bay 11-7085-induced apoptosis. Moreover, 15d-PGJ2 markedly inhibited Bay 11-7085-induced annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate binding (Fig. 3A) and caspase-8 cleavage (Fig. 3B). Two isoforms of caspase-8 were detected in chondrocyte (Fig. 3B) and synovial fibroblast extracts (Fig. 5A) (10Scaffidi C. Medema J.P. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26953-26958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). 15d-PGJ2 Inhibits BAY 11-7085-induced ERK1/2 Phosphorylation and Apoptosis in Chondrocytes from Osteoarthritic Cartilage—To test further the positive effect of 15d-PGJ2 on chondrocyte survival, experiments were performed on chondrocytes isolated from cartilage of OA patients. As in chondrocytes isolated from non-osteoarthritic cartilage (Fig. 1), BAY 11-7085, but not MG-132, induced sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation and apoptosis (Fig. 4, A–C). Furthermore, preincubation of osteoarthritic chondrocytes with 15d-PGJ2 inhibited both BAY 11-7085-induced apoptosis and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4C), and these effects were equivalent to the protective effects of 15-PGJ2 on non-osteoarthritic chondrocytes (Figs. 2 and 3B). 15d-PGJ2 Inhibits BAY 11-7085-induced ERK1/2 Phosphorylation and Apoptosis in Synovial Fibroblasts—We then tested the effect of prostaglandins on synovial fibroblasts and endothelial cells, two cell types whose proliferation have deleterious effects in joint rheumatoid disease. As in chondrocytes, Bay 11-7085-induced synovial fibroblast cell death was preceded with ERK1/2 phosphorylation that was down-regulated with 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 5A). 15d-PGJ2 also down-regulated Bay 11-7085-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and caspase 8 cleavage, confirming its antiapoptotic effect. In contrast, 15d-PGJ2 caused apoptosis of endothelial cells (Fig. 5B), as previously reported (11Bishop-Bailey D. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17042-17048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). MTS tests showed that 15d-PGJ2, PGD2, and (only at lower BAY 11-7085 concentrations) UO126, but not PGE2 and PGF2α, markedly protected synovial fibroblasts from BAY 11-7085-induced cell death (Fig. 6). Ciglitazone showed no protective effect in chondrocytes (data not shown) or in synovial fibroblasts (Fig. 6), suggesting that 15d-PGJ2 effect may be peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ-independent (11Bishop-Bailey D. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17042-17048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar, 12Subramaniam S. Strelau J. Unsicker K. J. Biol.

Moreover, Western blot showed that pretreatment with PGE2, PGF2α, or ciglitazone did not change BAY 11-7085-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which was efficiently down-regulated with 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 7A). Therefore, from the substances tested, only 15d-PGJ2 was able to prevent BAY 11-7085-induced caspase-8 cleavage (Fig. 7A). MEK1/2 inhibitor UO126 also down-regulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation; as in cell survival tests (Fig. 6), however, its effect was always less pronounced than that of15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 7B). These results suggested that sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation might be necessary for BAY 11-7085-induced apoptosis.Fig. 715d-PGJ2, PGD2, and MEK1/2 inhibitor, but not PGE2, PGF2α, or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonist, inhibit BAY 11-7085-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation.A, synovial fibroblasts were pre-treated with 15d-PGJ2, PGE2, PGF2α, or ciglitazone (20 μm) for 24 h.

In this work, we showed that BAY 11-7085, but not MG-132, induced sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation that preceded apoptosis of chondrocyte and synovial fibroblasts. Furthermore, we showed that the prostaglandin D2 metabolite 15d-PGJ2 down-regulated BAY 11-7085-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and rescued chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts from apoptosis. These results suggest that BAY 11-7085-induced sustained ERK1/2 phosphorylation might be proapoptotic.

However, the authors did not examine the effect of 15d-PGJ2 on ERK phosphorylation. We proposed here that the antiapoptotic effect of 15d-PGJ2 might be related to its inhibition of ERK1/2 activity. This inhibition seems to be, at least in part, distinct from MEK1/2, because the specific inhibitor UO126 showed significantly less antiapoptotic effect than 15d-PGJ2.

The effect of 15d-PGJ2 on synovial fibroblasts may therefore be disease-dependent, and we are currently testing this hypothesis.

Using an acute model of mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis (Thy1 GN), we show that neutralization of interleukin (IL)-10 greatly ameliorated the disease as expressed by both decreased MC expansion and proteinuria. Treatment with the tellurium compound AS101 (ammonium trichloro(dioxoethylene-o,o′)tellurate) resulted in favorable effects provided that the compound was administered 24 h before insult, whereas partial effects were obtained when administered after insult. We identified STAT3 as playing a pivotal role in IL-10-induced MC proliferation in vitro and in vivo. IL-10 activates MC STAT3 in vitro as expressed by its phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. The role of STAT3 in MC proliferation induced by IL-10 was deduced from results showing that IL-10-induced proliferation was abrogated if MC transfected with STAT3 antisense oligonucleotides were used or if cells were incubated with inhibitors of STAT3. AS101 deactivates STAT3 in control but not in MC transfected with IL-10 antisense oligonucleotides. Inactivation of STAT3 prevents reduction of MC proliferation by AS101. We further demonstrate the role of STAT3 in the regulation of cell cycle and survival regulatory proteins by AS101 in MC via inhibition of IL-10. IL-10 increased MC expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-X1 and simultaneously decreased the levels of p27kip1. These survival factors were decreased by AS101 in a STAT3- and IL-10-dependent manner, whereas p27kip1 was similarly increased. In Thy1 GN, phosphorylated STAT3 in glomerular MC peaked at day 6 and correlated with MC expansion. Neutralization of IL-10 or its inhibition by AS101 abolished phosphorylation of STAT3. This effect positively correlated with amelioration of the disease. These in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that the autocrine MC growth factor IL-10 induces MC proliferation via STAT3.

The results demonstrate that benzofuranylalanine, but not benzotriazolylalanine, is a substrate for phenylalanine tRNA synthetase αA294G, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis showed it to be incorporated into a model protein with high efficiency.

Science. 2003; 301: 964-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar) have also recently been described. The development of all such systems is dependent on engineering the substrate specificity of the aminoacyl tRNA synthetases or of the tRNA-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase pair. The aminoacyl tRNA synthetases charge tRNA with cognate amino acid before delivery of the aminoacyl-tRNA by elongation factor Tu to the ribosome for incorporation into nascent polypeptide (9Ibba M. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar). One approach to the development of unnatural amino acid recognition involves selective mutagenesis of the relevant aminoacyl tRNA synthetase to recognize amino acid analogues that are close structural mimics of the cognate amino acid (2Ibba M. Hennecke H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 3Datta D. Wang P. Carrico I.S. Mayo S.L. Tirrell D.A. J. Am. Chem.

For instance, an E. coli phenylalanine tRNA synthetase (PheRS) 1The abbreviations used are: PheRS, phenylalanine tRNA synthetase; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; FAB-MS, fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; shtDHFR, short histidine tag DHFR. variant carrying a single Ala → Gly amino acid substitution at α-subunit residue 294 (PheRS-αA294G) (10Ibba M. Kast P. Hennecke H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7107-7112Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) displays relaxed substrate specificity in vivo toward a number of para-substituted phenylalanine mimics. Examples include several halogenated phenylalanines including p-chlorophenylalanine (2Ibba M. Hennecke H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), p-bromophenylalanine (11Sharma N. Furter R. Kast P. Tirrell D.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and p-iodophenylalanine as well as p-cyanophenylalanine, p-ethynylphenylalanine, p-azidophenylalanine, and 2-,3-, and 4-pyridylalanine (12Kirshenbaum K. Carrico I.S. Tirrell D.A. Chembiochem. 2002; 3: 235-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Introducing the additional mutation Thr → Gly in position 251 (PheRS-αT251G/A294G) further enlarges the amino acid binding pocket, which provides space for phenylalanine analogues carrying modifications on the benzene ring and allows activation of still larger unnatural amino acids such as p-acetylphenylalanine (3Datta D. Wang P. Carrico I.S. Mayo S.L. Tirrell D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 5652-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Based upon previous studies of proteinogenic photoreactive amino acid analogues with bicyclic structures containing a benzene ring “scaffold” (13Behrens C. Nielsen J.N. Fan X.J. Doisy X. Kim K.H. Praetorius-Ibba M. Nielsen P.E. Ibba M. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 9443-9449Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), we set out to test such compounds as substrates for incorporation into a protein via PheRS-αA294G. Other unnatural amino acids shown to be substrates for this aminoacyl tRNA synthetase variant display distinct yet limited structural divergence from phenylalanine. In contrast, the presently tested analogues, benzofuranylalanine and benzotriazolylalanine (Fig. 1), contain an additional five-membered ring system fused to the benzene ring of phenylalanine. Although PheRS-αA294G (and PheRS-αT251G/A294G) appear rather flexible with respect to modifications at the para position of the benzene side chain, it is far from obvious that this mutant would accommodate amino acids carrying double ring systems involving joint substitutions at the meta and para position of the phenylalanine benzene side chain. Nevertheless, based on growth inhibition, we have previously proposed that benzofuranylalanine is indeed a substrate for PheRS-αA294G, opening up the possibility that such bicyclic amino acid analogs could be developed as substrates for protein synthesis (13Behrens C. Nielsen J.N. Fan X.J. Doisy X. Kim K.H. Praetorius-Ibba M. Nielsen P.E. Ibba M. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 9443-9449Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We now present in vitro results showing that benzofuranylalanine is a substrate for aminoacylation of tRNAPhe by PheRS-αA294G and directly demonstrate the in vivo incorporation of this amino acid analogue into a model protein using E. coli strains expressing mutant PheRS α-subunits and wild type tRNAPhe. In addition, another photoreactive and structurally related amino acid, benzotriazolylalanine, was synthesized and tested as a substrate for activation and aminoacylation.

High resolution mass spectrometry results for C9H11N4O2 were 207.0882 (calculated) and 207.0881 (experimental). UV Irradiation—Aqueous solutions of benzofuranylalanine and benzotriazolylalanine at the indicated concentrations in a quartz cuvette sealed with Parafilm were placed immediately adjacent to the desired UV light source with the following characteristics: Struers UVG-11, 254 nm; Philips TL20W/12RS, 320 nm; Phillips 20 W/09N, 365 nm. Samples were irradiated at room temperature for the desired length of time. At the desired time intervals the cuvette was removed, and the UV absorption spectrum was recorded using a Cary 300 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian). Charging and Competition Analyses—Wild type and αA294G E. coli PheRS were purified as previously described (10Ibba M. Kast P. Hennecke H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7107-7112Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). E. coli tRNAPhe was from Sigma. Pyrophosphate (PPi) exchange and aminoacylation reactions were performed as described (10Ibba M. Kast P. Hennecke H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7107-7112Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), with unlabeled benzofuranylalanine included at 2 and 4 mm for the determination of inhibition constants during aminoacylation. The direct attachment of benzofuranylalanine and benzotriazolylalanine to in vitro transcribed tRNA was monitored by direct 32P labeling of tRNAPhe using E. coli tRNA-terminal nucleotidyltransferase (15Seth M. Thurlow D.L. Hou Y.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4521-4532Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) followed by aminoacylation and product visualization as previously described (16Wolfson A.D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5965-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Expression Analyses—In vivo incorporation of benzofuranylalanine into recombinant murine dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) was performed as previously described using the phenylalanine auxotrophic strains AF-1Q/pQE-15 (PheRS α wild type) and AF-1Q/pQE-FS (PheRS-αA294G mutant) (11Sharma N. Furter R. Kast P. Tirrell D.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). An overnight culture was diluted into fresh M9 minimal media supplemented with the 20 amino acids at 20 μg/ml and the antibiotics ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (40 μg/ml) and grown to an A600 of 0.6–1.0. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice in 20 ml of ice-cold 0.9% NaCl, and resuspended in fresh M9 media containing antibiotics and all natural amino acids except phenylalanine. The cells were separated into aliquots of 1–2-ml fractions and supplemented with benzofuranylalanine (2 mm) and phenylalanine (0.1 mm) as indicated, grown for 10 min at 37 °C, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and then grown for 4–5 h at 30 °C. 100 μl of cells grown in the presence of phenylalanine (and the A600/ml normalized amount of cells grown with unnatural amino acid) were harvested by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of B-PER (Pierce) and 20 μl of 2x SDS loading buffer and heated to 90 °C for 5–10 min, and 10 μl was analyzed using 12% acrylamide-SDS page minigels followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Protein Purification—Protein purification was done using strain AF-1Q/pQE-FS (PheRS-αA294G mutant) from 10 ml of M9 minimal media cultures supplemented with 19 amino acids (20 μg/ml) and benzofuranylalanine (2 mm) or phenylalanine (0.1 mm) as described (3Datta D. Wang P. Carrico I.S. Mayo S.L. Tirrell D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 5652-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and using nickel nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography spin columns under denaturing conditions as recommended (Qiagen). Buffer exchange from 8 m urea, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 4.5, into water was done using 2 ml Amicon 10-kDa cutoff ultrafiltration spin filters. Mass Spectrometry—Mass spectrometry analyses were performed using a SpectraChrom Kompact MALDI II instrument from Kratos. MALDI-TOF samples were prepared by mixing 1 μl of protein sample (0.2–0.25 μg) per 4 μl of matrix (α-cyano-4 hydroxycinnamic acid at 10 mg/ml in 50% acetonitrile 50% H2O). The samples were spotted onto MALDI-TOF slides using 4.5 μl per application. Chymotrypsinogen A (25,657 Da) and β-lactoglobulin A (18,364 Da) were used as calibration standards. The slide was examined for “sweet spots” before running the experiment. 250 profiles were accumulated per sample. Synthesis of Bicyclic Amino Acids—Benzofuranylalanine was synthesized as previously reported (13Behrens C. Nielsen J.N. Fan X.J. Doisy X. Kim K.H. Praetorius-Ibba M. Nielsen P.E. Ibba M. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 9443-9449Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the novel benzotriazolylalanine was prepared as shown in Scheme 1 starting from commercially available 5-(hydroxymethyl)triazole using standard chemistry. Enantiomeric resolution was achieved using Carlsberg subtilisin (13Behrens C. Nielsen J.N. Fan X.J. Doisy X. Kim K.H. Praetorius-Ibba M. Nielsen P.E. Ibba M. Tetrahedron. 2000; 56: 9443-9449Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) for specific hydrolysis of the l-form of an ester intermediate. Photochemistry of the Unnatural Amino Acids—The [2+2] photocycloadditions of alkenes are extremely specific and often of high (quantum) yields. These could therefore be very useful for sequence-specific post-modification of proteins, provided an activated alkene with appropriate absorbance characteristics can be site specifically incorporated into a protein, since no other functionality of similar reactivity is naturally present in proteins. Benzofurans undergo [2+2] photocycloaddition with a variety of alkenes (e.g. Ref. 17Sakamoto M. Kinbara A. Yagi T. Mino T. Yamaguchi K. Fujita T. Chem. Commun. 2000; : 1201-1202Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar), although the furan double bond is only weakly activated by the adjacent oxygen. However, benzofurans also undergo other photochemical reactions. To study the photosensitivity of benzofuranylalanine, the compound was irradiated at different wavelengths, and the corresponding UV absorption spectra were recorded over time (Fig. 2). Upon irradiation at 254 nm the absorption peak at 245 nm declined, and a “shoulder” peak with a maximum of 342 nm appeared with similar kinetics (estimated t½, ∼50 min) compatible with a photochemical reaction (Fig. 2A). However, because most proteins (due to the presence of aromatic amino acids) and all nucleic acids as well as other cell components have strong absorption at 254 nm, many unwanted side reactions are bound to occur both in vitro and especially in vivo upon such irradiation. Conversely, considerably fewer photoreactions take place in biological systems upon irradiation at longer wavelengths. Consequently, we also irradiated the amino acids at 320 and 365 nm, where the benzofuran chromophore exhibits a weak absorption (λmax = 342 nm), now focusing on the UV spectra in the range 300–400 nm (Fig. 2, B and C). At 320 nm of irradiation, both the spectral changes as well as the time course of the change in absorbance at the initial absorbance maximum of 342 nm (Fig. 2B) clearly show that at least two photochemical transformations take place, a fast reaction with an estimated t½ of ∼ 6 min and a subsequent slow reaction over many hours. Strikingly, at 365 nm of UVA irradiation only the fast component was observed. We have not attempted to analyze the actual products at this stage, but these results clearly demonstrate the photosensitivity of the benzofuran ligand, and thus, its potential utility as a photochemical handle upon incorporation into proteins. A potential caveat of using UVA irradiation (λ, ∼335 nm) involves the formation of photo adducts between thiouridine and cytidine at positions 8 and 13 in some tRNAs of E. coli (18Yaniv M. Favre A. Barrell B.G. Nature. 1969; 223: 1331-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), causing an amino acid starvation response. Once the cells are removed from UV exposure, however, the effects are reversed, and they recover by synthesis of new functional tRNAs (19Ramabhadran T.V. Jagger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 59-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Benzotriazoles undergo photochemical reactions reminiscent of the highly photosensitive azides. The predominant photoreaction involves release of molecular nitrogen (N2) and formation of a radical species that may either undergo radical insertion reactions or nucleophilic addition reactions (e.g. Ref. 20Wang H. Burda C. Persy G. Wirz J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 5849-5855Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), both giving rise to chemical cross-linking. Upon incorporation into a protein, the benzotriazole ligand would constitute a site for specific photochemical cross-linking to an interacting biological ligand, e.g. another protein or a nucleic acid. Irradiation at 254 and 320 nm of the benzotriazolylalanine resulted in pronounced spectral changes, fully compatible with a single photochemical conversion taking place (isosbestic points are observed at least at shorter irradiation times), with an estimated t½ of 60 min (Fig. 3, A and B). These results support the potential use of this amino acid for site-specific photosensitization of proteins if incorporated. However, at 365 nm of irradiation (at which wavelength the benzotriazole does not show any significant absorption) no spectral changes were observed, indicating that this wavelength cannot be utilized for induction of photochemical reactions using the benzotriazolylalanine. Steady-state Kinetics for Bicyclic Amino Acids—To investigate charging with unnatural amino acids, we first tested the ability of benzofuranylalanine and benzotriazolylalanine to inhibit aminoacylation of tRNAPhe. Benzofuranylalanine did not show any inhibition of the wild type enzyme (data not shown) but acted as a competitive inhibitor for PheRS-αA294G (Table I). In contrast, the addition of benzotriazolylalanine had no effect on aminoacylation by either form of PheRS. To further investigate whether benzofuranylalanine might be a substrate for activation by the mutant form of the enzyme, PPi exchange analysis was performed. The PPi exchange reaction showed that benzofuranylalanine is a substrate for PheRS-αA294G, with a Km of 2.3 ± 0.4 mm and a kcat of 923 ± 65 min–1. PPi exchange with the wild type enzyme showed some low but inconsistent activity, suggesting that benzofuranylalanine might be poorly activated. As expected, phenylalanine showed a higher reaction rate, and no activity at all was seen when the reaction was performed without substrate.Table ISteady-state kinetic parameters for aminoacylation by αA294G PheRS with [14C]-phenylalanine in the presence of [12C]-benzofuranylalanine (Bzf)BzfKmkcatKiaKi was determined from the following formula KMapp = KMreal (1 + [Bzf]/Ki). Phe, phenylalanine; NA, not applicable.mmμm Phemin-1μm Bzf020.2 ± 6211 ± 27NA2159 ± 39179 ± 24291 ± 1104333 ± 100163 ± 26258 ± 110a Ki was determined from the following formula KMapp = KMreal (1 + [Bzf]/Ki). Phe, phenylalanine; NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab We also tested benzofuranylalanine and benzotriazolylalanine directly as substrates for the aminoacylation of 3′-[32P]-tRNAPhe (Fig. 4). Benzofuranylalanine was found to be a substrate for aminoacylation by αA294G but not wild type PheRS, and benzotriazolylalanine was a substrate for neither enzyme. These results are consistent with the kinetic analyses and confirm that benzofuranylalanine, but not benzotriazolylalanine, can be attached to tRNAPhe by PheRS-αA294G. In addition they indicate that benzofuranylalanine, in contrast to natural non-cognate amino acids, is not a substrate for the hydrolytic proofreading activity of PheRS (10Ibba M. Kast P. Hennecke H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7107-7112Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In Vivo Incorporation of Bicyclic Amino Acids—To test whether benzofuranylalanine and/or benzotriazolylalanine are in vivo protein synthesis substrates, we used a phenylalanine auxotrophic E. coli strain encoding PheRS-αA294G on an episome (strain AF-1Q/pQE-FS) and the isogenic strain lacking the mutant tRNA synthetase-encoding gene (strain AF-1Q/pQE-15) as a control. Both strains harbor an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible expression cassette encoding murine DHFR carrying a short histidine tag (shtDHFR). As previously reported (11Sharma N. Furter R. Kast P. Tirrell D.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), both strains show abundant overproduction of shtDHFR upon the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in the presence of phenylalanine (Fig. 5, compare lanes 1 with 2 and lane 5 with 6). However, only strain AF-1Q/pQE-FS produced large amounts of shtDHFR when substituting benzofuranylalanine for phenylalanine (compare lanes 3 and 7). In fact, in the presence of wild type PheRS alone shtDHFR production did not increase beyond background when conducting the experiment with benzofuranylalanine. These results indicate that benzofuranylalanine is indeed an in vivo substrate for PheRS-αA294G and, consistent with the in vitro data, is not utilized by wild type PheRS. A slight but notable expression of shtDHFR was observed even in the absence of added phenylalanine or benzofuranylalanine (lanes 4 and 8). This was previously ascribed to residual cellular pools of phenylalanine remaining even after extensive washing of the cells (3Datta D. Wang P. Carrico I.S. Mayo S.L. Tirrell D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 5652-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 11Sharma N. Furter R. Kast P. Tirrell D.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Similar analyses were conducted using the benzotriazolylalanine. Consistent with the in vitro data, no shtDHFR production above background was observed upon the addition of benzotriazolylalanine (data not shown). We also tested the strain AF-1Q/pQE-T251G/A294G carrying a double mutant PheRS α-subunit (3Datta D. Wang P. Carrico I.S. Mayo S.L. Tirrell D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 5652-5653Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) for incorporation of unnatural amino acids into shtDHFR. In accordance with the data obtained using strain AF-1Q/pQE-FS, the double mutant utilized benzofuranylalanine but showed no shtDHFR expression above background in the presence of benzotriazolylalanine (data now shown). Thus, benzofuranylalanine, but not benzotriazolylalanine, is a substrate for PheRS αT251/A294G. Analysis of Benzofuran-containing shtDHFR—Because benzofuranylalanine (Mr 205) has a larger mass as compared with phenylalanine (Mr 165), incorporation of benzofuran into the reporter protein should be readily detectable as a significant mass increase of shtDHFR containing benzofuran. Mass spectrometry analysis of purified protein revealed molecular masses of 24,284 and 23,957 Da for shtDHFR expressed in the presence of benzofuranylalanine and phenylalanine, respectively (Fig. 6). This clearly demonstrates the incorporation of unnatural amino acid and corresponds to an average of ∼8 benzofuranylalanine replacements in nine possible positions. Conclusions—The data presented show that benzofuranylalanine, but not benzotriazolylalanine, is an efficient substrate for cellular protein synthesis as a result of its ability to be attached to tRNAPhe by PheRS-αA294G. These findings are of potential interest in the development of novel protein cross-linking methodologies given that benzofuranylalanine was found to be photoreactive at UVA wavelengths. The effective application of such methodologies is dependent on site-specific replacement of particular residues with benzofuranylalanine rather than global insertion in response to all phenylalanine codons as described here. Although a completely site-specific system may require extensive mutagenesis of both PheRS and a tRNAPhe-derived suppressor species or perhaps another pair (4Wang L. Brock A. Herberich B. Schultz P.G. Science. 2001; 292: 498-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar), existing heterologous codon-biased systems offer the potential to replace designated Phe residues with benzofuranylalanine in certain targets (21Kwon I. Kirshenbaum K. Tirrell D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 7512-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 22Furter R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2000728115,"More than half of the reported missense changes in the breast cancer susceptibility protein BRCA1 occur in exon 11, but none has been clearly identified as disease associated and only 28 are designated 'probable' neutral polymorphisms. Previously, in a comparison of sequences from 57 eutherian mammal species, we found seven 'highly conserved regions' between amino acids 282 and 1103, and identified 38 missense changes as likely to disrupt gene function. These conserved regions were also present in birds and amphibians and included only six of the mutations predicted to affect function. In this new analysis, we hypothesized that using 37 ancestral sequences derived from the 57 GenBank sequences and including eight marsupial sequences would allow us to identify regions unique to mammals and refine our predictions of disease-associated missense changes. We identified 13 conserved regions, three of which appear to be unique to mammals, and 21 likely disease-associated missense changes, 11 of which occur in conserved regions. Seven regions identified in this analysis, including the three found only in mammalian sequences, and nine missense changes predicted to affect function are in the putative STAT1-interaction domain, suggesting that the role of STAT1 in immune response is important to mammary function. The reduction in the number of missense changes predicted to be disease associated and the identification of conserved regions specific to mammals can facilitate the further study of the role of missense changes in BRCA1-associated breast cancers."
