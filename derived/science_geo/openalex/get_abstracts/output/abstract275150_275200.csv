https://openalex.org/W2034638449,"Synchronous multispecific spawning by a total of 32 coral species occurred a few nights after late spring full moons in 1981 and 1982 at three locations on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. The data invalidate the generalization that most corals have internally fertilized, brooded planula larvae. In every species observed, gametes were released; external fertilization and development then followed. The developmental rates of externally fertilized eggs and longevities of planulae indicate that planulae may be dispersed between reefs."
https://openalex.org/W2015115114,Several mutants resistant to the herbicides chlorsulfuron and sulfometuron methyl were isolated form cultured cells of Nicotiana tabacum. Resistance was inherited as a single dominant or semidominant mutation in all cases. Linkage analysis of six mutants identified two unlinked genetic loci. Studies of plants homozygous for one mutation showed the mutant plants to be completely resistant to treatment with a concentration of chlorsulfuron 100 times higher than that which produces symptoms of phytotoxicity on normal plants.
https://openalex.org/W2052812951,"Sunlight is directly converted to chemical energy in hydrogen-evolving photoelectrochemical cells with semiconductor electrodes. Their Gibbs free energy efficiency of solar-to-hydrogen conversion, 13.3 percent, exceeds the solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency of green plants and approaches the solar-to-electrical conversion efficiency of the best p-n junction cells. In hydrogen-evolving photoelectrodes, electron-hole pairs photogenerated in the semiconductor are separated at electrical microcontacts between the semiconductor and group VIII metal catalyst islands. Conversion is efficient when the island diameters are small relative to the wavelengths of sunlight exciting the semiconductor; when the island spacings are smaller than the diffusion length of electrons at the semiconductor surface; when the height of the potential energy barriers that separate the photogenerated electrons from holes at the semiconductor surface is raised by hydrogen alloying of the islands; when radiationless recombination of electron-hole pairs at the semiconductor-solution interface between the islands is suppressed by controlling the semiconductor surface chemistry; and when the semiconductor has an appropriate band gap (1.0 to 1.8 electron volts) for efficient solar conversion."
https://openalex.org/W2047271565,"There is much evidence that the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary was marked by a massive meteorite impact. Theoretical consideration of the consequences of such an impact predicts sharp extinctions in many groups of animals precisely at the boundary. Paleontological data clearly show gradual declines in diversity over the last 1 to 10 million years in various invertebrate groups. Reexamination of data from careful studies of the best sections shows that, in addition to undergoing the decline, four groups (ammonites, cheilostomate bryozoans, brachiopods, and bivalves) were affected by sudden truncations precisely at the iridium anomaly that marks the boundary. The paleontological record thus bears witness to terminal-Cretaceous extinctions on two time scales: a slow decline unrelated to the impact and a sharp truncation synchronous with and probably caused by the impact."
https://openalex.org/W2014732466,"Evidence indicates that the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary is very sharp, and, within the limits of resolution, it is apparently synchronous at the various boundary localities. Arguments to the contrary, particularly those of Officer and Darke, are shown to invalid."
https://openalex.org/W1999653635,"The results of a detailed study of the brachiopods of the most complete Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary in Denmark, Nye Klslashed circlev, show an extinction pattern for this marine invertebrate group compatible with that reported for pelagic foraminifera and coccoliths and with the impact scenario. The extinction is abrupt, coinciding with the Maastrichtian-Danian boundary. There is no warning in the form of decreasing density, decreasing diversity, or early extinction of specialized groups. The basal few meters of the Danian are almost devoid of brachiopods, and a Danian brachiopod fauna starts almost as abruptly as the Maastrichtian fauna disappeared. The new fauna is similar to the Maastrichtian as regards density and diversity, and at maximum six species are common to both stages. The northwest European Masstrichtian chalk is composed mainly of the remains of coccoliths and pelagic foraminifera. The mass extinction of these groups led to a total cessation of chalk production. The chalk is overlain by a thin clay bed deposited partly under anoxic conditions. This combination of anoxia and clay deposition coupled with a cessation of productivity led to the extinction of specialized groups such as the chalk brachiopods. The surviving species included forms that could survive in well-aerated shallow marine waters on substrates other than chalk."

https://openalex.org/W1973856653,"Inaccurate stratigraphic correlations in the Hell Creek area, Montana, have led to the assumption that transitional vertebrate faunas (Bug Creek Anthills) exist in the latest Cretaceous, refuting a catastrophic turnover at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. Establishment of the transitional faunas in Paleocene channels that cut down through the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary renders the terrestrial faunal record compatible with the marine record and with catastrophic extinction."
https://openalex.org/W2033629863,Iridium concentrations are anomalously high at the palynological Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary in fluvial sedimentary rocks of the lower part of the Raton Formation at several localities in the Raton Basin of New Mexico and Colorado. The iridium anomaly is associated with a thin bed of kaolinitic claystone in a discontinuous carbonaceous shale and coal sequence.

https://openalex.org/W1998540897,"In summary, then, let me restate my conviction that the most critical needs of management in the next decade will be met by the identification and cultivation of the innovative, creative, adaptable individual who sets as his goal the translation of technology for society's needs. He will require a command of the growing body of managerial knowledge. He will need a continual refreshment of that knowledge through contact with the university as he seeks to deal with a world in change. If his firm is to encourage and use his creative capacity, it will be careful about his entry into the organization and his movement up the ladder, stressing only the values that count, that are pivotal, and taking care not to drive him into rebellion or conformity. The firm will be inventive about ways to give him opportunities to test his ideas. It will experiment with organizational forms which promote creativity. It will encourage adventure and accept risk. And in its success, it will be serving the needs of our societies in ways that will make our greatest hopes for technology a full and human reality."
