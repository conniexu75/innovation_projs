Studies in relevant animal models have indicated that overactivity in selective hippocampal circuits contributes to cognitive impairment. Here, we tested the effect of reducing hippocampal activation in aMCI. Under placebo treatment, hippocampal activation in the dentate gyrus/CA3 was elevated in aMCI patients compared to a healthy control group. By using a low dose of the antiepileptic levetiracetam hippocampal activation in aMCI was reduced to a level that did not differ from the control group. Compared to aMCI memory performance under placebo, performance in the scanning task was significantly improved under drug treatment. Contrary to the view that greater hippocampal activation might serve a beneficial function, these results support the view that increased hippocampal activation in aMCI is a dysfunctional condition and that targeting excess hippocampal activity has therapeutic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2014213883,"The observation of a flare of radiation from the centre of an inactive galaxy fits a model of the tidal disruption of a helium-rich stellar core and its accretion onto a black hole of about three million solar masses. Central supermassive black holes in distant galaxies are normally invisible to us, but sometimes their presence becomes evident in the form of flares produced by the tidal disruption of a star being accreted to the black hole. Such events are rare, and often we see only the later stages of the encounter — but here, Gezari et al. report detailed monitoring of an ultraviolet and optical flare from the nuclear region of an inactive galaxy at a redshift of 0.1696, which was first seen on 31 May 2010, peaked in July and was over by September. The observed continuum is cooler than expected for a simple accreting debris disk, but the well sampled rise and decline of the light curve follows the predicted mass-accretion rate. The black hole has about two million solar masses and the disrupted star had a helium-rich stellar core, as the authors deduced from the spectroscopic signature of ionized helium from the unbound debris. The flare of radiation from the tidal disruption and accretion of a star can be used as a marker for supermassive black holes that otherwise lie dormant and undetected in the centres of distant galaxies1. Previous candidate flares2,3,4,5,6 have had declining light curves in good agreement with expectations, but with poor constraints on the time of disruption and the type of star disrupted, because the rising emission was not observed. Recently, two ‘relativistic’ candidate tidal disruption events were discovered, each of whose extreme X-ray luminosity and synchrotron radio emission were interpreted as the onset of emission from a relativistic jet7,8,9,10. Here we report a luminous ultraviolet–optical flare from the nuclear region of an inactive galaxy at a redshift of 0.1696. The observed continuum is cooler than expected for a simple accreting debris disk, but the well-sampled rise and decay of the light curve follow the predicted mass accretion rate and can be modelled to determine the time of disruption to an accuracy of two days. The black hole has a mass of about two million solar masses, modulo a factor dependent on the mass and radius of the star disrupted. On the basis of the spectroscopic signature of ionized helium from the unbound debris, we determine that the disrupted star was a helium-rich stellar core."
https://openalex.org/W2072844010,"The Antarctic ice sheet loses mass at its fringes bordering the Southern Ocean. At this boundary, warm circumpolar water can override the continental slope front, reaching the grounding line through submarine glacial troughs and causing high rates of melting at the deep ice-shelf bases. The interplay between ocean currents and continental bathymetry is therefore likely to influence future rates of ice-mass loss. Here we show that a redirection of the coastal current into the Filchner Trough and underneath the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf during the second half of the twenty-first century would lead to increased movement of warm waters into the deep southern ice-shelf cavity. Water temperatures in the cavity would increase by more than 2 degrees Celsius and boost average basal melting from 0.2 metres, or 82 billion tonnes, per year to almost 4 metres, or 1,600 billion tonnes, per year. Our results, which are based on the output of a coupled ice-ocean model forced by a range of atmospheric outputs from the HadCM3 climate model, suggest that the changes would be caused primarily by an increase in ocean surface stress in the southeastern Weddell Sea due to thinning of the formerly consolidated sea-ice cover. The projected ice loss at the base of the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf represents 80 per cent of the present Antarctic surface mass balance. Thus, the quantification of basal mass loss under changing climate conditions is important for projections regarding the dynamics of Antarctic ice streams and ice shelves, and global sea level rise."

However, the nature and potential modulation of the major input to the LHb originating from the basal ganglia are poorly understood. Although the output of the basal ganglia is thought to be primarily inhibitory, here we show that transmission from the basal ganglia to the LHb is excitatory, glutamatergic, and suppressed by serotonin. Behaviorally, activation of this pathway is aversive, consistent with its role as an “antireward” signal. Our demonstration of an excitatory projection from the basal ganglia to the LHb explains how LHb-projecting basal ganglia neurons can have similar encoding properties as LHb neurons themselves. Our results also provide a link between antireward excitatory synapses and serotonin, a neuromodulator implicated in depression.

Input to the lateral habenula from the basal ganglia is excitatory Excitatory input to the lateral habenula from the basal ganglia is glutamatergic Input to the lateral habenula from the basal ganglia is aversive Serotonin suppresses excitatory input to the LHb from the basal ganglia Recent studies in monkeys have shown that neurons in the lateral habenula (LHb) become active when an animal fails to receive an expected reward or if the animal receives a signal indicating a negative outcome (Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2007Matsumoto M. Hikosaka O. Lateral habenula as a source of negative reward signals in dopamine neurons.Nature. 2007; 447: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar), i.e., these neurons encode “antireward” conditions and compute reward prediction errors—the difference between the amount of reward expected and the amount of reward received, a computation that is thought to drive reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 1998Sutton R. Barto A. Reinforcement Learning. MIT press, Cambridge, MA1998Google Scholar). LHb neurons have also been shown to inhibit dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (Ji and Shepard, 2007Ji H. Shepard P.D.

Two types of dopamine neuron distinctly convey positive and negative motivational signals.Nature. 2009; 459: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the view that an antireward (LHb) nucleus inhibits a reward (VTA) center and drives negative reward signals in dopamine neurons. However, the nature of the inputs that drive aversive responses in the LHb, as well as their possible modulation by other neurotransmitters, is poorly understood. The globus pallidus internus (GPi), an output region of the basal ganglia, and its nonprimate homolog, the entopeduncular (EP) nucleus, are major sources of input to the primate (Kim et al., 1976Kim R.

The GPi and EP are thought to be primarily inhibitory brain regions because neurons in both structures express GABAergic molecular markers (Oertel et al., 1984Oertel W.H. Nitsch C. Mugnaini E.

Dis. 2005; 20: 347-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and lesions of the EP greatly reduce these markers in the LHb and thalamus (Penney and Young, 1981Penney Jr., J.B. Young A.B.

Kimura H. McGeer E.G. A histochemical study of GABA-transaminase in the efferents of the pallidum.Brain Res. 1982; 241: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recently, it was found that most LHb-projecting pallidal neurons have reward-modulated activity that begins before that of LHb neurons themselves, consistent with upstream control of LHb neurons (Hong and Hikosaka, 2008Hong S. Hikosaka O. The globus pallidus sends reward-related signals to the lateral habenula.Neuron. 2008; 60: 720-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, LHb-projecting pallidal neurons display antireward characteristics, similar to LHb neurons (Hong and Hikosaka, 2008Hong S. Hikosaka O. The globus pallidus sends reward-related signals to the lateral habenula.Neuron. 2008; 60: 720-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that either inhibitory projections out of the basal ganglia disynaptically disinhibit LHb neurons or a previously unidentified excitatory projection exists from the basal ganglia to the LHb. Here we test the hypothesis that an excitatory projection exists from the EP to the LHb that signals aversive events. We use a combination of optogenetics and immunohistochemistry to show that the projection from the EP to the LHb is predominantly excitatory, glutamatergic, and aversive. We also show that the excitatory projection from the EP to the LHb is suppressed by low concentrations of serotonin, providing a link between aversive signaling in the LHb and a neuromodulator involved in mood disorders. To test the hypothesis that the projection from the EP to the LHb is excitatory, we injected AAV-driving expression of the light-inducible cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 (Boyden et al., 2005Boyden E.S. Zhang F. Bamberg E. Nagel G. Deisseroth K. Millisecond-timescale, genetically targeted optical control of neural activity.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1263-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3371) Google Scholar), tagged with yellow fluorescent protein (ChR2-YFP), into the EP in vivo. Two weeks after injection, we prepared coronal brain slices, which displayed localized fluorescence in neuronal cell bodies in the EP (Figure 1A and see Figure S1 available online) as well as fluorescent fibers in the projection region, the lateral aspect of the LHb (Figure 1B and Figure S1). To test for excitation of LHb neurons by EP inputs, we obtained whole-cell current-clamp recordings from neurons in the lateral aspect of the LHb and stimulated the EP inputs to the LHb with brief (0.5–5 ms) pulses of 470 nm light through an LED-coupled optic fiber placed over the LHb. Consistent with the EP providing excitatory input to the LHb, light stimulation produced depolarizing synaptic responses at resting potentials (Figures 1C and 1D; 13/13 cells depolarized). To maximize detection of any hyperpolarizing synaptic response, we injected depolarizing current and raised the membrane potential close to 0mV. Even in these conditions, the slope of the postsynaptic response remained positive for 12 out of 13 cells (Figures 1C and 1D), indicating dominant depolarizing synaptic input. Bath application of NBQX largely blocked the excitatory response, indicating its mediation by AMPA-type glutamate receptors (Figure 1E), although we could detect GABA-mediated currents when cells were clamped at positive holding potentials (Figure S1). Voltage-clamp recordings in the presence of picrotoxin (100 μM) showed that the excitatory EP input consisted of inwardly rectifying AMPA responses and minimal NMDA responses (Figures 1F and 1G). To confirm the electrophysiological results, we injected in vivo the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B conjugated with Alexa 488 (CTx488) into the LHb (Figure 2A ), followed by immunohistochemistry of the EP. Consistent with the electrophysiological results, we found that about two-thirds of retrogradely labeled cell bodies in the EP expressed the vesicular glutamate transporter VGLUT2, a marker of glutamatergic neurons, and a minority expressed the GABAergic marker GAD67 (Figure 2B). These results indicate substantial excitatory, glutamatergic projections from the basal ganglia to the LHb, projections that probably contribute to the antireward responses of LHb neurons (Hong and Hikosaka, 2008Hong S. Hikosaka O. The globus pallidus sends reward-related signals to the lateral habenula.Neuron. 2008; 60: 720-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2007Matsumoto M. Hikosaka O. Lateral habenula as a source of negative reward signals in dopamine neurons.Nature. 2007; 447: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). The majority of neurons in the basal ganglia that project to the primate LHb are excited by aversive stimuli, similar to LHb neurons themselves (Hong and Hikosaka, 2008Hong S. Hikosaka O. The globus pallidus sends reward-related signals to the lateral habenula.Neuron. 2008; 60: 720-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). This suggests that output neurons of the basal ganglia that project to the LHb are driving LHb neurons' responses to aversive stimuli and predicts that stimulation of fibers from the EP to the LHb is aversive. To allow selective activation of the EP-LHb pathway in vivo, we injected AAV that drives expression of ChR2-YFP into the rat EP and implanted chronic dual fiberoptic cannulae that provided optical access to the LHb bilaterally (Figure S2). Three weeks later, we optically stimulated ChR2-YFP-expressing axons in the LHb (which originated from cell bodies in the EP) via a fiberoptic cable connected to the implanted cannulae and coupled to a blue laser. To determine whether stimulation of the EP-LHb pathway is aversive or rewarding, we tested rats for directed place preference by using a two-compartment (A and B) shuttle box (see Experimental Procedures and Figure 3A ). During a baseline period of 10 min, the animals spent equal time in compartments A and B. Subsequently, during the next 30 min, light pulses (20 Hz) were delivered to the LHb when the animal was in compartment A. Animals developed a clear avoidance of compartment A during this period (Figure 3B). This aversive effect was reversible, because optogenetic activation of the EP-LHb pathway while animals were in compartment B reversed the avoidance (Figures 3C–3E); delivery of light alone had no effect (Figures 3F and 3G). These results indicate that the EP-LHb pathway provides aversive signals to the animal consistent with EP driving excitatory, antireward signals of the LHb. The LHb has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression (Hikosaka, 2010Hikosaka O. The habenula: from stress evasion to value-based decision-making.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, Li et al., 2011Li B. Piriz J. Mirrione M. Chung C. Proulx C.D. Schulz D. Henn F. Malinow R. Synaptic potentiation onto habenula neurons in the learned helplessness model of depression.Nature. 2011; 470: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), potentially by reducing the output of brainstem aminergic neurons (Ferraro et al., 1996Ferraro G. Montalbano M.E. Sardo P. La Grutta V. Lateral habenular influence on dorsal raphe neurons.Brain Res. Bull. 1996; 41: 47-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Hikosaka, 2010Hikosaka O.

Lateral habenula stimulation inhibits rat midbrain dopamine neurons through a GABA(A) receptor-mediated mechanism.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 6923-6930Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). However, the neuromodulation of transmission that drives LHb neurons is poorly understood. Because of its well-established role in depression, we tested whether serotonin could modulate the synaptic and/or intrinsic excitability of LHb neurons. We focused on neurons in the lateral aspect of the LHb, which received input from the ChR2-YFP-labeled EP. To examine the synaptic target of serotonin, we recorded responses to paired-light pulses (separated by 100 ms) in voltage clamp. Synaptic currents were reduced by bath application of low concentrations of serotonin (Figure 4A ; 27% ± 6% depression after first light pulse; p = 0.001; n = 10 cells), but not dopamine (Figure 4A; 7% ± 5%; p = 0.26; n = 7 cells), and the ratio of the second to first response increased after serotonin application (Figures 4B and 4C; 22% ± 9% increase; p = 0.02), consistent with a reduction in the probability of neurotransmitter release. In contrast to serotonin's effect on synapses, we observed no change in the response to depolarizing current injection (Figures 4D and 4E; all p > 0.1; n = 13 cells) and no change in resting potential (Vm before serotonin, −56mV ± 2mV; after serotonin, −56mV ± 2mV; p > 0.6; n = 13 cells). These results indicate that serotonin provides presynaptic inhibition to excitatory input from the EP to the LHb. Here we investigate the physiological and behavioral function of basal ganglia outputs to the LHb by in vivo labeling of the EP nucleus with ChR2-YFP. We find that this pathway is primarily excitatory and glutamatergic and provides an aversive stimulus, consistent with upstream control of LHb antireward responses. Our results explain how a basal ganglia output, traditionally thought to be inhibitory (Oertel et al., 1984Oertel W.H. Nitsch C. Mugnaini E. Immunocytochemical demonstration of the GABA-ergic neurons in rat globus pallidus and nucleus entopeduncularis and their GABA-ergic innervation.Adv. Neurol. 1984; 40: 91-98PubMed Google Scholar), can display similar encoding properties as its target nucleus, the LHb (Hong and Hikosaka, 2008Hong S. Hikosaka O. The globus pallidus sends reward-related signals to the lateral habenula.Neuron. 2008; 60: 720-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). We also examined the impact of serotonin on neurons in the LHb, a nucleus that provides inhibitory influence over brainstem aminergic nuclei (Ferraro et al., 1996Ferraro G. Montalbano M.E. Sardo P. La Grutta V. Lateral habenular influence on dorsal raphe neurons.Brain Res. Bull. 1996; 41: 47-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Hikosaka, 2010Hikosaka O.

Lateral habenula stimulation inhibits rat midbrain dopamine neurons through a GABA(A) receptor-mediated mechanism.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 6923-6930Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), including dopaminergic neurons (Ji and Shepard, 2007Ji H. Shepard P.D. Lateral habenula stimulation inhibits rat midbrain dopamine neurons through a GABA(A) receptor-mediated mechanism.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 6923-6930Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). We show that the excitatory EP input to the LHb is suppressed by serotonin, suggesting that serotonin inhibits upstream synapses responsible for decreasing dopamine output. Our findings provide a link between a neuromodulator relevant to mood disorders and an antireward circuit. Our discovery of a direct, glutamatergic projection from the EP to the LHb is consistent with a recent study showing expression of VGLUT2 mRNA in the EP (Barroso-Chinea et al., 2008Barroso-Chinea P. Rico A.J. Pérez-Manso M. Roda E. López I.P. Luis-Ravelo D. Lanciego J.L. Glutamatergic pallidothalamic projections and their implications in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.Neurobiol. Dis. 2008; 31: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This study found high VGLUT2 mRNA expression in the rostral EP that preferentially targets the LHb (Araki et al., 1984Araki M. McGeer P.L. McGeer E.G. Retrograde HRP tracing combined with a pharmacohistochemical method for GABA transaminase for the identification of presumptive GABAergic projections to the habenula.Brain Res. 1984; 304: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) but also VGLUT2 mRNA in neurons that project to the thalamus. We extend this finding by demonstrating the presence of a strong, excitatory, glutamatergic projection from the EP to the LHb, as well as VGLUT2 expression in the majority of LHb-projecting EP neurons. We also show that stimulation of the excitatory projection from the EP to the LHb is aversive, suggesting that glutamatergic inputs from the EP to the LHb drive LHb neuronal responses to aversive events. Consistent with previous results (Oertel et al., 1984Oertel W.H. Nitsch C. Mugnaini E.

A histochemical study of GABA-transaminase in the efferents of the pallidum.Brain Res. 1982; 241: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we also found electrophysiological and immunohistochemical evidence of a GABAergic projection from the EP to the LHb. Our immunohistochemistry suggested that a minority of LHb-projecting EP neurons are GABAergic, consistent with a previous pharmacohistochemical study (Araki et al., 1984Araki M. McGeer P.L. McGeer E.G. Retrograde HRP tracing combined with a pharmacohistochemical method for GABA transaminase for the identification of presumptive GABAergic projections to the habenula.Brain Res. 1984; 304: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), although we cannot rule out the possibility that our GAD67 antibody did not label all GABAergic EP neurons. The function of this GABAergic projection is unclear. It may control the gain of LHb neuronal activity or, given that LHb neurons are inhibited by unexpected, rewarding stimuli (Hong and Hikosaka, 2008Hong S. Hikosaka O. The globus pallidus sends reward-related signals to the lateral habenula.Neuron. 2008; 60: 720-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2007Matsumoto M. Hikosaka O. Lateral habenula as a source of negative reward signals in dopamine neurons.Nature. 2007; 447: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar), these inputs may signal the presence of reward. Future studies that selectively manipulate GABAergic inputs to the LHb are needed to address this issue. We have isolated and characterized the synapses of a specific projection thought to participate in the computation of reward prediction errors—the difference between the amount of reward expected and the amount of reward received, a computation thought to drive reinforcement learning (Sutton and Barto, 1998Sutton R. Barto A. Reinforcement Learning. MIT press, Cambridge, MA1998Google Scholar). Given that both LHb-projecting basal ganglia neurons and LHb neurons are excited by the presence of unexpected, aversive events (Hong and Hikosaka, 2008Hong S. Hikosaka O. The globus pallidus sends reward-related signals to the lateral habenula.Neuron. 2008; 60: 720-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2007Matsumoto M. Hikosaka O. Lateral habenula as a source of negative reward signals in dopamine neurons.Nature. 2007; 447: 1111-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar) and our finding that projections from the basal ganglia to the LHb are excitatory and aversive, it is likely that excitatory projections from the basal ganglia to the LHb signal negative reward prediction errors. Interestingly, the activity of these excitatory projections was suppressed by low concentrations of serotonin. This suggests that synapses that transmit reward prediction errors are subject to neuromodulation and opens new avenues for the study of the interaction between mood and learning. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, age 28–32 days at time of surgery (42–46 days when sacrificed for slice experiments), were housed one to four/cage and kept on a 12/12 hr light-dark cycle (lights on/off at 6 a.m./6 p.m.). All procedures involving animals were approved by the Institute Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of California, San Diego. cDNA encoding the flexed version of ChR2(H134R)-eYFP was kindly provided by Dr. Karl Deisseroth (Stanford). To make the nonflexed version, we PCR amplified ChR2(H134R)-eYFP sequence flanked by KpnI and EcoRI sites and subcloned them into pAAV-EF1α-flexed-ChR2(H134R)-eYFP-WPRE vector by using same restriction sites. Sequencing confirmed gene sequence integrity. AAV-EF1α-ChR2(H134R)-eYFP-WPRE (serotype 1; 9 × 1011 GC ml−1) (named AAV-ChR2-YFP in the text), and AAV-CMV-mCherry were made by Salk Vector Core. Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane for stereotaxic bilateral injection of AAV-ChR2-YFP into the EP (A-P: −2.1 mm from bregma; M-L: 2.55–2.70 mm; D-V: −6.3 to −6.9 mm from dura). We injected 0.1–0.5 μl of virus into each hemisphere over 8–20 min by using a picospritzer. Control rats for behavior experiments were injected with an AAV encoding mCherry. The injection pipette was not removed until 10 min after the end of the infusion to allow diffusion of the virus. Subjects for the behavioral experiment were injected with virus as described above, and dual fiberoptic cannulae (Doric Lenses) were implanted in order to have the tip of the fiberoptic cannulae (200 μm, 0.22 NA) above the left and the right LHb (A-P: −3.6 mm from bregma; M-L: ±0.75 mm; D-V: −4.0 mm from dura) (see Figure S2) and were secured to the skull with screws and dental cement. Rats were injected subcutaneously with 5 mg/kg carprofen (NSAID) after surgery. Rats (n = 7 in ChR2-YFP group, n = 5 in mCherry control group) used for directed place preference (DPP) underwent surgery at 4–7 weeks old, and behavior experiments were conducted at least 3 weeks after surgery. DPP was carried out in a shuttle box (50 cm wide × 25 cm deep × 30 cm high; Coulbourne Instrument) equipped with a door separating the two halves and photocell detectors. Walls were modified in order to present different patterns to provide contextual differences. Photocell detectors allowed automatic monitoring of rat location in the cage for the duration of testing. Optical activation of ChR2-YFP-expressing axons was performed by using an optical fiber coupled to a 473 nm solid-state laser diode (OEM Laser Systems) with 20 mW of output from the 200 μm fiber. Directed place preference was designed in order to monitor preference/aversion induced by optical stimulation of the LHb. Throughout the full duration of the test, rats were free to explore both sides of the cage. The first 10 min allowed us to measure preference for either context without manipulation. No preference was found during this first 10 min. After this 10 min baseline period, optical stimulation (continuous 20 Hz, 5 ms pulse duration) was delivered while the animal was in one context (defined as “context A”). For the next 30 min, optical stimulation of the LHb occurred whenever the rat was located in context A. Optical stimulation was stopped when the animal was in the other side of the cage (context B). Avoidance scores were measured by taking time spent in context B minus time spent in context A divided by total time (120 s). Student's t test compared avoidance score from period 10–40 min to baseline (0–10 min period). In a different set of DPP testing, pairing of the optical stimulation with context A (20 min) was switched to context B for another 20 min and then paired again with context A for the last 10 min of the 1 hr session (see schematic in Figure 3). One ChR2-YFP-expressing rat lost its cannula before the DPP reversal test, so only six ChR2-YFP-expressing rats were tested for reversal of DPP. Student's t test compared avoidance score from periods 10–30, 30–50, and 50–60 min to baseline period (0–10 min). Two weeks after surgery, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane before decapitation and brain removal. Brains were chilled in ice-cold dissection buffer (110.0 mM choline chloride, 25.0 mM NaHCO3, 1.25 mM NaH2PO4, 2.5 mM KCl, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 7.0 mM MgCl2, 25.0 mM glucose, 11.6 mM ascorbic acid, and 3.1 mM pyruvic acid; gassed with 95% O2/5% CO2) and cut in 400-μm-thick coronal slices through the EP and LHb. Slices were transferred to 35°C ACSF (118 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 26.2 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 20 mM glucose, 4 mM MgCl2, and 4 mM CaCl2 [pH 7.4]; 22°C–25°C; gassed with 95% O2/5% CO2) for 30 min. After an additional 30 min of recovery at room temperature (RT), slices were transferred to the recording chamber and constantly perfused with 27°C ACSF. Recordings were made from cells in the lateral half of the LHb, where ChR2-YFP expression was highest, by using an Axopatch 1D amplifier with a 5 kHz sampling frequency and a filter set at a −3 dB cutoff frequency of 5 kHz. For current-clamp recordings, the intracellular solution consisted of 130 mM K-Gluconate, 5 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 4 mM Na2ATP, 0.4 mM Na3GTP, 10 mM Na-phosphocreatine, and 0.6 mM EGTA (pH 7.2). For voltage-clamp recordings, the intracellular solution consisted of 7.5 mM QX314, 115 mM cesium methanesulfonate, 20 mM CsCl, 10 mM HEPES, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 4 mM Na2-ATP, 0.4 mM Na-GTP, 10 mM Na-phosphocreatine, and 0.6 mM EGTA (pH 7.2). We delivered 470 nm light pulses to the LHb via an optic fiber attached to an LED. To examine the effect of serotonin (1 μM in all experiments) on excitability, we also injected current (−100, 0, 100, 200, and 300 pA) for 300 ms—one current injection every 10 s in current clamp. To examine the effect of serotonin on light-evoked currents, we clamped cells at −50mV, and 0.5–5 ms light pulses were given in pairs, 100 ms between each pulse, every 10 s. Picrotoxin (100 μM) was included in the extracellular recording solution during voltage-clamp but not current-clamp recordings. For I-V recordings, NBQX (3 μM) and APV (100 μM) were added during the recordings taken at −60mV, 0mV, and 40mV (minimum ten sweeps taken at each potential before and after each drug) to determine the contribution of AMPA and NMDA receptors to excitatory currents. After recordings were completed, slices were fixed in 4% formaldehyde overnight and mounted on slides for localization of the injection site and labeled projection to the LHb. For measurement of the effects of EP fiber stimulation on membrane potential for each cell, the slope of the postsynaptic potential (PSP) was measured (average of three sweeps) at resting potential. The same start and peak times were used to compute the PSP slope during depolarization (average of three sweeps). The time intervals used to determine the effect of serotonin on excitability were 0–150 s before serotonin and 7.5–10 min after serotonin. Excitatory current amplitude was measured as the peak amplitude in a 2 ms window between 3–20 ms after the light pulse. All values given in the text and figures indicate mean ± SEM. Student's t test was used with p < 0.05 deemed significant. To label LHb-projecting EP neurons, we unilaterally injected 0.5 μl of cholera toxin subunit B conjugate to the Alexa Fluor 488 (CTx488) (2 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline, PBS [pH 7.4]) in the LHb (AP: −3.6 mm, ML: 0.7 mm, DV: −4.8 mm) over 5–7 min. Rats were allowed to survive for 40 hr, were perfused, and their brains were processed for immunohistochemistry. For perfusion, rats were deeply anesthetized by using a mix of ketamine/dexdomitor (75 and 5 mg/kg, respectively intraperitoneally) and transcardially perfused with saline followed by a solution of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB [pH 7.4]) containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were postfixed overnight in the same solution, rinsed with PB, and cryoprotected by immersion in PB/30% sucrose solution for 3 days. Frozen brains were sectioned at 50 μm with a sliding microtome in the coronal plane. For each brain, three slices encompassing the entopeduncular nucleus were chosen for immunohistochemistry. Free-floating slices were first blocked in TN (Tris 0.1M, 1% NaCl [pH 7.4]) buffer containing 10% normal goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100 for 3 hr. After blocking, slices were incubated with the following antibodies diluted in TN/3% NGS/0.2% Triton X-100 solution: anti-VGLUT2 (Millipore) or anti-GAD67 (Millipore) for 48 hr at RT. After three washes in TN buffer, slices were incubated with secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-mouse (Invitrogen) in TN/3% NGS/0.2% Triton X-100 for 4 hr at RT. Slices were washed and mounted by using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). Images were taken with a FV1000 confocal microscope (Olympus), adjusted for brightness by using Fluoview software, and assembled in Adobe Illustrator.

https://openalex.org/W2040751411,"Psychological studies in humans and behavioral studies of model organisms suggest that forgetting is a common and biologically regulated process, but the molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms underlying forgetting are poorly understood. Here we show that the bidirectional modulation of a small subset of dopamine neurons (DANs) after olfactory learning regulates the rate of forgetting of both punishing (aversive) and rewarding (appetitive) memories. Two of these DANs, MP1 and MV1, exhibit synchronized ongoing activity in the mushroom body neuropil in alive and awake flies before and after learning, as revealed by functional cellular imaging. Furthermore, while the mushroom-body-expressed dDA1 dopamine receptor is essential for the acquisition of memory, we show that the dopamine receptor DAMB, also highly expressed in mushroom body neurons, is required for forgetting. We propose a dual role for dopamine: memory acquisition through dDA1 signaling and forgetting through DAMB signaling in the mushroom body neurons."

https://openalex.org/W1970282176,"Maladaptive impulsivity is a core symptom in various psychiatric disorders. However, there is only limited evidence available on whether different measures of impulsivity represent largely unrelated aspects or a unitary construct. In a cross-species translational study, thirty rats were trained in impulsive choice (delayed reward task) and impulsive action (five-choice serial reaction time task) paradigms. The correlation between those measures was assessed during baseline performance and after pharmacological manipulations with the psychostimulant amphetamine and the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine. In parallel, to validate the animal data, 101 human subjects performed analogous measures of impulsive choice (delay discounting task, DDT) and impulsive action (immediate and delayed memory task, IMT/DMT). Moreover, all subjects completed the Stop Signal Task (SST, as an additional measure of impulsive action) and filled out the Barratt impulsiveness scale (BIS-11). Correlations between DDT and IMT/DMT were determined and a principal component analysis was performed on all human measures of impulsivity. In both rats and humans measures of impulsive choice and impulsive action did not correlate. In rats the within-subject pharmacological effects of amphetamine and atomoxetine did not correlate between tasks, suggesting distinct underlying neural correlates. Furthermore, in humans, principal component analysis identified three independent factors: (1) self-reported impulsivity (BIS-11); (2) impulsive action (IMT/DMT and SST); (3) impulsive choice (DDT). This is the first study directly comparing aspects of impulsivity using a cross-species translational approach. The present data reveal the non-unitary nature of impulsivity on a behavioral and pharmacological level. Collectively, this warrants a stronger focus on the relative contribution of distinct forms of impulsivity in psychopathology."
https://openalex.org/W2131150711,"Observations at submillimetre and X-ray wavelengths show that rapid star formation was common in the host galaxies of active galactic nuclei when the Universe was 2–6 Gyr old, but that the most vigorous star formation is not observed around powerful black holes, thereby confirming a key prediction of models in which an active galactic nucleus expels the interstellar medium of its host galaxy. Radiation from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) outshines that produced by star formation at most wavelengths, but in the far-infrared to millimetre waveband AGNs emit comparatively little radiation in comparison with strongly star-forming galaxies. A combination of deep X-ray observations from the Chandra catalogue and submillimetre observations from the SPIRE instrument on the Herschel Space Observatory shows that rapid star formation was common in the host galaxies of AGNs when the Universe was between two billion and six billion years old, but that vigorous star formation is not seen around the more luminous black holes. This suppression of star formation in galaxies that host a powerful AGN is a key prediction of models in which the AGN expels the interstellar medium of its host galaxy when it becomes sufficiently powerful. The old, red stars that constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massive black holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history when galaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (AGN) shone brightly as a result of accretion onto black holes. It is widely suspected, but unproved, that the tight correlation between the mass of the black hole and the mass of the stellar bulge1 results from the AGN quenching the surrounding star formation as it approaches its peak luminosity2,3,4. X-rays trace emission from AGN unambiguously5, whereas powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and are brightest at infrared and submillimetre wavelengths6. Here we report submillimetre and X-ray observations that show that rapid star formation was common in the host galaxies of AGN when the Universe was 2–6 billion years old, but that the most vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an X-ray luminosity of 1044 ergs per second. This suppression of star formation in the host galaxy of a powerful AGN is a key prediction of models in which the AGN drives an outflow7,8,9, expelling the interstellar medium of its host and transforming the galaxy’s properties in a brief period of cosmic time."
https://openalex.org/W1994732950,"It is currently unclear whether the GluN2 subtype influences NMDA receptor (NMDAR) excitotoxicity. We report that the toxicity of NMDAR-mediated Ca(2+) influx is differentially controlled by the cytoplasmic C-terminal domains of GluN2B (CTD(2B)) and GluN2A (CTD(2A)). Studying the effects of acute expression of GluN2A/2B-based chimeric subunits with reciprocal exchanges of their CTDs revealed that CTD(2B) enhances NMDAR toxicity, compared to CTD(2A). Furthermore, the vulnerability of forebrain neurons in vitro and in vivo to NMDAR-dependent Ca(2+) influx is lowered by replacing the CTD of GluN2B with that of GluN2A by targeted exon exchange in a mouse knockin model. Mechanistically, CTD(2B) exhibits stronger physical/functional coupling to the PSD-95-nNOS pathway, which suppresses protective CREB activation. Dependence of NMDAR excitotoxicity on the GluN2 CTD subtype can be overcome by inducing high levels of NMDAR activity. Thus, the identity (2A versus 2B) of the GluN2 CTD controls the toxicity dose-response to episodes of NMDAR activity."
https://openalex.org/W2044465987,"The anterior insular cortex (AIC) and its unique spindle-shaped von Economo neuron (VEN) emerged within the last decade as having a potentially major role in self-awareness and social cognition in humans. Invasive examination of the VEN has been precluded so far by the assumption that this neuron occurs among primates exclusively in humans and great apes. Here, we demonstrate the presence of the VEN in the agranular anterior insula of the macaque monkey. The morphology, size, laminar distribution, and proportional distribution of the monkey VEN suggest that it is at least a primal anatomical homolog of the human VEN. This finding sheds new light on the phylogeny of the VEN and AIC. Most importantly, it offers new and much-needed opportunities to investigate the primal connections and physiology of a neuron that could be crucial for human self-awareness, social cognition, and related neuropsychiatric disorders."

Here, we investigated whether face-selective cells in the primate brain exploit contrast features as well. We recorded from face-selective neurons in macaque inferotemporal cortex, while presenting a face-like collage of regions whose luminances were changed randomly. Modulating contrast combinations between regions induced activity changes ranging from no response to a response greater than that to a real face in 50% of cells. The critical stimulus factor determining response magnitude was contrast polarity, for example, nose region brighter than left eye. Contrast polarity preferences were consistent across cells, suggesting a common computational strategy across the population, and matched features used by computer vision algorithms for face detection. Furthermore, most cells were tuned both for contrast polarity and for the geometry of facial features, suggesting cells encode information useful both for detection and recognition.

Previous studies have proposed that the key element in shape representation is contours and that this representation may be encoded by local curvature and orientation across the population of V4 cells, which project to IT (Brincat and Connor, 2004Brincat S.L.

Neurosci. 2002; 5: 1332-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar); however, contours are only one source of information available in the retinal image. Another rich source of information about object shape is contrast. Humans can detect and recognize objects in extremely degraded images consisting of only a few pixels (Harmon and Julesz, 1973Harmon L.D. Julesz B.

Face recognition by humans: nineteen results all computer vision researchers should know about.Proc. IEEE. 2006; 94: 1948-1962Crossref Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Thus, high-frequency information and fine feature details may not be necessary for object detection. What types of features are available in the low-frequency range? One possibility is features based on coarse-level contrast cues. Contrast features have been proposed as an intermediate feature representation in computer vision systems (Papageorgiou et al., 1998Papageorgiou, C.P., Oren, M., and Poggio, T. (1998). General framework for object detection. ICCV Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Computer Vision 555–562.Google Scholar) and are ubiquitous in state-of-the art object recognition systems, in particular, for face detection (Lienhart and Jochen, 2002Lienhart, R., and Jochen, M.

(2001). Rapid object detection using a boosted cascade of simple features. Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 1, I-511–I-518.Google Scholar). If contrast is an important component of object representation in IT cortex, one would expect cells to be strongly modulated by contrast manipulations, such as global contrast reversal. Indeed, when Tanaka et al., 1991Tanaka K. Saito H. Fukada Y. Moriya M. Coding visual images of objects in the inferotemporal cortex of the macaque monkey.J. Neurophysiol. 1991; 66: 170-189PubMed Google Scholar (Ito et al., 1994Ito M. Fujita I. Tamura H. Tanaka K. Processing of contrast polarity of visual images in inferotemporal cortex of the macaque monkey.Cereb. Cortex. 1994; 4: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) presented simple geometrical shapes such as stars or ellipses, with different protrusions to IT cells and manipulated the contrast by global contrast reversal or outlining (removing contrast from filled regions and retaining only edges), many cells (>95%) showed dramatic reductions in firing rate, suggesting that cells in IT carry information about contrast polarity (Fujita et al., 1992Fujita I.

Columns for complex visual object features in the inferotemporal cortex: clustering of cells with similar but slightly different stimulus selectivities.Cereb. Cortex. 2003; 13: 90-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Although characterizing cell responses to contrast reversal reveals whether contrast is important, this approach does not address the more fundamental question of how contrast sensitivity might contribute to the form selectivity of a given neuron. Moreover, other studies report that IT cells do not change their firing rates with contrast reversal (Baylis and Driver, 2001Baylis G.C. Driver J. Shape-coding in IT cells generalizes over contrast and mirror reversal, but not figure-ground reversal.Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 937-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, Rolls and Baylis, 1986Rolls E.T. Baylis G.C. Size and contrast have only small effects on the responses to faces of neurons in the cortex of the superior temporal sulcus of the monkey.Exp. Brain Res. 1986; 65: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), leading to the conclusion that a hallmark of object representation in IT cortex lies in its ability to generalize over global contrast reversal. Thus, the importance of contrast in shape encoding in IT has remained elusive. Here, we ask whether contrast features serve as a fundamental building block for object selectivity in macaque IT cortex. This question has been difficult to answer in previous studies because cells were picked at random from IT cortex. The variance of cells' shape preferences in such random sampling was large and prohibited a systematic study involving local manipulations of parts and their contrasts. Here, we take advantage of the known shape selectivity in macaque face-selective regions. These regions have a high concentration of cells firing stronger to faces compared to other objects (Tsao et al., 2006Tsao D.Y. Freiwald W.A. Tootell R.B.H. Livingstone M.S. A cortical region consisting entirely of face-selective cells.Science. 2006; 311: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). The known shape selectivity enabled us to focus on the individual parts constituting the face and to investigate the role of contrast by systematically manipulating contrast across parts while preserving effective contours. If contrast plays a role in shape coding, we would expect it to have an effect at early stages of face processing. By using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with a face localizer stimulus, we targeted our recordings to the middle face patches. There are several indications that the middle face patches likely represent an early stage of face processing. First, cells in the middle face patches are still view-specific, unlike those in more anterior face-selective regions (Freiwald and Tsao, 2010Freiwald W.A. Tsao D.Y. Functional compartmentalization and viewpoint generalization within the macaque face-processing system.Science. 2010; 330: 845-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Second, some cells in the middle face patches still fire to object stimuli sharing rudimentary features with faces, such as apples and clocks (Tsao et al., 2006Tsao D.Y. Freiwald W.A. Tootell R.B.H. Livingstone M.S. A cortical region consisting entirely of face-selective cells.Science. 2006; 311: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). Although face-selective cells have been shown to be tuned for fine structural details (Freiwald et al., 2009Freiwald W.A. Tsao D.Y. Livingstone M.S. A face feature space in the macaque temporal lobe.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1187-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), their selectivity for coarse-level features has not been investigated. Many coarse-level contrast feature combinations are possible. However, only a few can be considered predictive of the presence of a specific object in an image. The predictive features can be found by an exhaustive search (Lienhart and Jochen, 2002Lienhart, R., and Jochen, M. (2002). An extended set of Haar-like features for rapid object detection Proceedings of the 2002 IEEE International Conference on Image Processing. 1, 900–903.Google Scholar, Viola and Jones, 2001Viola, P., and Jones, M. (2001). Rapid object detection using a boosted cascade of simple features. Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 1, I-511–I-518.Google Scholar) or by other considerations, such as consistency across presentations with different lighting conditions (i.e., invariance to illumination changes). Indeed, a simple computational model for face detection based on illumination-invariant contrast features was proposed by Sinha, 2002Sinha, P. (2002). Qualitative representations for recognition. Proceedings of the Annual Workshop on Biologically Motivated Computer Vision, 249–262.Google Scholar. In Sinha's model, a face is detected in a given image if 12 conditions are met. Each condition evaluates a local contrast feature (luminance difference across two regions of the face, e.g., nose and left eye) and tests whether contrast polarity is along the direction predicted from illumination invariance considerations. Here, we tested whether face-selective cells are tuned for contrast features useful for face detection. We measured responses to an artificial parameterized stimulus set, as well as to large sets of real face and nonface images with varying contrast characteristics, to elucidate the role of contrast in object representation. We identified the locations of six face patches in the temporal lobes of three macaque monkeys with fMRI by presenting an independent face localizer stimulus set and contrasting responses to real faces with those to nonface objects (Moeller et al., 2008Moeller S.

USA. 2008; 105: 19514-19519Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). We then targeted the middle face patches for electrophysiological recordings (Ohayon and Tsao, 2012Ohayon S. Tsao D.Y. MR-guided stereotactic navigation.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2012; 204: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar; see Experimental Procedures; Figure S1 available online). We recorded 342 well-isolated single units (171 in monkey H, 129 in monkey R, and 42 in monkey J) while presenting images in rapid succession (5 images / s). Images were flashed for 100 ms (ON period) and were followed by a gray screen for another 100 ms (OFF period). Monkeys passively viewed the screen and were rewarded with juice every 2–4 s during fixation. We presented 16 real face images and 80 nonface object images to assess face selectivity (Tsao et al., 2006Tsao D.Y. Freiwald W.A. Tootell R.B.H. Livingstone M.S. A cortical region consisting entirely of face-selective cells.Science. 2006; 311: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). We quantified how well each cell discriminated face images from nonface images using the d′ measure (see Experimental Procedures) and considered cells to be face selective if d′ > 0.5. Under this criterion, 280/342 cells (137 in monkey H, 108 in monkey R, and 35 in monkey J) were found to be face selective across the population (Figure 1, see Experimental Procedures). Similar results were obtained with other face selectivity metrics (Figures S2A and S2B). Motivated by coarse contrast features that are ubiquitously used in state-of-art face detection systems (Figure 2A ; Viola and Jones, 2001Viola, P., and Jones, M. (2001). Rapid object detection using a boosted cascade of simple features. Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 1, I-511–I-518.Google Scholar), we designed a simple 11-part stimulus (Figure 2B) to assess selectivity for luminance contrasts in the face. In brief, we decomposed the picture of an average face to 11 parts (Figure 2B) and assigned each part a unique intensity value, ranging between dark and bright. By selecting different permutations of intensities, we could generate different stimuli. We randomly selected 432 permutations to cover all possible pair-wise combinations of parts and intensities (see Experimental Procedures). We first tested whether cells selective for real face images would respond to our artificial parameterized stimulus. Cells typically showed large variance of response magnitudes to the different parameterized stimuli. The example cell in Figure 2C fired vigorously for only a subset of the parameterized faces. The subset that was effective drove the cell to levels that were comparable to those to real faces, whereas other parameterized stimuli were less effective in driving the cell, leading to firing rates that were comparable to those to objects. A similar trend was observed across the population (Figure 2D). Parameterized face stimuli elicited responses ranging between nothing to strong firing (Figure 2D, right column). Thus, different luminance combinations can either be effective or ineffective drivers for cells. To test the extent to which a parameterized face could drive cells, we computed the maximal response across all 432 parameterized face stimuli and compared it to the maximal response evoked by a real face (Figure S2C). In about half of the cells (145/280), the maximal evoked response by a parameterized face was stronger than the maximal evoked response by a real face. Furthermore, the minimal evoked response across the 432 parameterized face stimuli was smaller than the maximal evoked response by objects. Thus, middle face patch neurons can be driven by highly simplified stimuli lacking many of the fine structural features of a real face, such as texture and fine contours. On average, we found 60 ± 76 parameterized stimuli per cell that elicited firing rates greater than the mean firing rate to real faces, indicating that the observed ratio of maximal responses was not due to a single stimulus. Thus, some of the artificial stimuli seem to be good proxies for real faces. Cells responded to the parameterized stimulus set with large variability, but are there any rules governing whether or not a given stimulus elicits a strong response? If so, what are these rules, and do they apply to all cells? We hypothesized that relative intensity, that is, contrast, across parts and its polarity are the governing principles underlying the observed responses. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed firing rate as a function of the pair-wise contrast polarity among the 11 face parts. For each cell, we considered all 55 possible part pairs (pair table, Table S1). For a given part pair (A–B), we compared the responses to stimuli with intensity of part A greater than part B with responses to the reversed contrast polarity, irrespective of the luminance values assumed by the remaining nine face parts. If contrast polarity plays a role in determining the observed variability, cells should show significant differences in firing rates for the condition A > B versus the condition A < B. We found that middle face patch neurons are indeed sensitive to the contrast between face parts and its polarity. This is illustrated by an example cell in Figure 3A (same cell that is shown in Figure 2C), whose firing rate was significantly modulated by 29 of 55 contrast pairs (p < 10−5, Mann-Whitney U-test). Not only were these firing rate differences significant, they were also sizeable. For example, the example cell fired about twice as strongly when the intensity in the left eye region was lower than that of the nose region (30 Hz versus 15 Hz; Figure 3A), irrespective of all other nine face parts. The same pattern of results was observed across the population. Out of the 280 face-selective cells, 138 (62/135 in monkey H, 57/108 in monkey R, and 19/35 in monkey J) were significantly tuned for at least one contrast polarity pair (p < 10−5, Mann-Whitney U-test). Those cells sensitive to contrast polarity features were influenced by 8.13 ± 7.17 features (Figure S3). Different cells were tuned for different contrast polarity features. The tuning for contrast polarity features can be summarized in a tuning matrix, indicating for each part-pair whether it was significant and if so which polarity evoked the stronger response. The tuning matrix of monkey R (Figure 3B) illustrates the diversity but also consistency of significant tuning in the population. Similar tuning matrices were observed for monkey H (Figure 3C) and monkey J (Figure 3D). Thus, about 50% of face-selective cells encode some aspect of contrast polarity across face parts. Is there a common principle behind the observed tuning to contrast polarity? Computational models, as well as psychophysics observations (Sinha, 2002Sinha, P. (2002). Qualitative representations for recognition. Proceedings of the Annual Workshop on Biologically Motivated Computer Vision, 249–262.Google Scholar, Sinha et al., 2006Sinha P. Balas B. Ostrovsky Y.

Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition. 1, I-511–I-518.Google Scholar), have suggested that if a certain feature is useful in predicting the presence of an object in an image, its contrast polarity should be consistent across different image presentations and should generalize over different illumination conditions and small changes in viewpoint. To test this, we conducted illumination invariance measurements for human and macaque faces (Figures S4A–S4D) and confirmed that a subset of contrast polarity features, such as eye-forehead, can predict the presence of a face in an image because polarity is consistent and eyes tend to be darker than the forehead in the majority of images tested. Thus, some contrast polarity features can serve as good indicators to the presence of a face under various light configurations. To test whether middle face patch neurons coded contrast polarity consistently, we plotted the number of cells that significantly preferred A > B along the positive axis and the number of cells that significantly preferred A < B along the negative axis (Figure 4A ). Notice that for a proposed part pair, each cell can either vote along the positive direction or along the negative direction (but not both), depending on which direction elicited the higher significant firing rate. The histogram of cells tuned for specific contrast pairs in Figure 4A demonstrates very strong consistency across the population for preferred polarity direction. For example, whereas 95 (42 in monkey H, 41 in monkey R, and 11 in monkey J) cells preferred the left eye to be darker than the nose (pair index 11), just a single cell was found that preferred the opposite polarity. The same result was found across other pairs: if a contrast polarity direction was preferred by one cell, it was also preferred by almost all other cells that were selective for the contrast of the part combination. We quantified this by measuring the polarity consistency index (see Experimental Procedures). A consistency index of the value of one indicates that all cells agree on their contrast polarity preference, whereas a consistency index of zero indicates that half of the cells preferred one polarity direction and the other half preferred the opposite polarity direction. Pooling data from all three monkeys, we found the consistency index to be 0.93 ± 0.15 (discarding features for which less than two tuned cells were found). Furthermore, polarity histograms from each individual monkey show that preferred polarities were highly consistent across the three animals (Figure 4B). Thus, face-selective cells are not encoding a random set of contrast polarities across face parts but instead have a highly consistent preference for polarity depending on the part pair. Do the preferred contrast polarities agree with predicted features that are useful for face detection? To test this we plotted the polarities proposed by the Sinha model (Sinha, 2002Sinha, P. (2002). Qualitative representations for recognition. Proceedings of the Annual Workshop on Biologically Motivated Computer Vision, 249–262.Google Scholar), as well as two other predictions from our illumination invariance measurements (Figure 4A). Overall, we found that many of the predicted contrast polarity features were represented across the population. Importantly, almost no cells were found to be tuned to a polarity opposite to the prediction (Figure S4E). Although cells were highly consistent in their contrast polarity preference for any given part pair, they varied widely as to which pairs they were selective for. Some contrast pairs were more prominently represented than others. The most common contrast pair was nose > left eye, for which almost 70% of the cells were tuned, followed closely by nose > right eye (Figure 4C). Although the most common features involved the eye region, many other regions were represented as well. A graphical representation of the tuning for several random cells is shown in Figure 4D. Green lines represent a significant part pair that does not include the eye region, whereas yellow lines denote pairs including the eye region. Notice that for some of these cells, the significant feature included nonneighboring parts as well (e.g., top right corner, forehead – chin). Cells encoded on average 4.6 features involving eyes (out of a possible 19) and 3.3 features that did do not include the eye region (out of a possible 36). This suggests that cells are encoding a holistic representation that includes multiple face parts but not necessarily the entire face. The parts constituting the parameterized face stimulus consisted of large regions (Figure 2B), suggesting that selectivity for contrast polarity between these parts is based on low-spatial frequency information. However, it is also possible that contrast information was extracted just from the borders between face parts and could thus be based on high-frequency information. To test to what extent low- and high-frequency information contribute to the contrast selectivity, we conducted two further experiments in which we presented two variants of the parameterized stimulus (Figures S5C and S5E). The first variant retained the contrast relationships from the original experiment but only along the contours (Figure S5C). The second variant was a heavily smoothed version of the original parameterized face. If high-frequency information is critical, we would expect to see the same modulation for the first, but not the second, variant. We recorded from 18 additional face-selective units in monkey R and presented both the original parameterized face and the first variant. The cells showed similar patterns of tuning for the original parameterized face (Figure S5B), but almost no significant tuning was found for the first variant (Figure S5D). To further validate that high-frequency information is not the critical factor, we recorded 34 additional face-selective units in monkey R while presenting the second, heavily smoothed variant of the parameterized face (Figure S5E). In this case, we found similar tuning for contrast polarity as for the original parameterized face stimulus (Figure S5F). To further evaluate the contribution of contours compared to contrast, we generated a third parameterized face stimulus variant in which we varied the luminance level of all parts simultaneously, resulting in 11 different stimuli (Figure 5A ). These stimuli lacked the contrast differences across parts but maintained the same contours that were present in the normal parameterized face stimuli. The third variant stimuli were presented along with the main experiment stimuli (real faces, normal parameterized stimulus, and nonface objects) to further characterize the same 280 face-selective units (from the analysis in Figures 2, 3, and 4). To assess the contribution of contrast, we considered a contrast relationship to be “correct” if its polarity agreed with the Sinha model (Sinha, 2002Sinha, P. (2002). Qualitative representations for recognition. Proceedings of the Annual Workshop on Biologically Motivated Computer Vision, 249–262.Google Scholar; see Figure S4E for list of correct part pairs). We found that the stimuli that contained contours but no contrast relationships elicited a response that was comparable to stimuli with only a few correct features but was still significantly higher (almost 3-fold in magnitude) than the response to nonface objects (Figure 5B). Thus, both contours and correct contrast contribute to the overall firing rate of cells, and sensitivity to contrast polarity features arises from low-spatial frequency information across large regions of the face. Our results obtained from simplified face stimuli suggest that correct contrast is necessary to yield strong responses from face-selective cells. Do these results extend to real faces? And, is correct contrast even sufficient, that is, does correct contrast, when it occurs outside a face, trigger large responses too? To investigate these issues, we generated an image set containing 207 real faces (registered and normalized in size) and"

We used fMRI with a novel incentivized skill task to examine the neural processes underlying behavioral responses to performance-based pay. We found that individuals' performance increased with increasing incentives; however, very high incentive levels led to the paradoxical consequence of worse performance. Between initial incentive presentation and task execution, striatal activity rapidly switched between activation and deactivation in response to increasing incentives. Critically, decrements in performance and striatal deactivations were directly predicted by an independent measure of behavioral loss aversion. These results suggest that incentives associated with successful task performance are initially encoded as a potential gain; however, when actually performing a task, individuals encode the potential loss that would arise from failure.

These results suggest that incentives associated with successful task performance are initially encoded as a potential gain; however, when actually performing a task, individuals encode the potential loss that would arise from failure. Very high monetary incentives result in poor behavioral performance During incentive presentation, striatal activity increases with increasing incentives During task performance, striatal activity decreases with increasing incentives Performance and striatal responses are predicted by behavioral loss aversion It is generally assumed that an increase in financial incentive provided for work will result in greater performance (Lazear, 2000Lazear E.P. Performance pay and productivity.Am. Econ. Rev. 2000; 90: 1346-1361Crossref Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The reasoning behind this idea is that larger incentives increase a worker's motivation, which, in turn, elicits improved behavioral output and performance. However, recent behavioral experiments suggest a more idiosyncratic interplay between incentives and performance (Ariely et al., 2009Ariely D. Gneezy U. Loewenstein G. Mazar N. Large stakes and big mistakes.Rev. Econ. Stud. 2009; 76: 451-469Crossref Scopus (401) Google Scholar): when executing skilled tasks, individuals' performance increases as the level of incentive increases only up to a point, after which greater incentives become detrimental to performance. Despite the ubiquity of performance-based incentive schemes in the workforce, the neural and psychological underpinnings of the relationship between incentives and performance are not well understood. Although the relationship between financial incentives and performance has received limited investigation, the paradoxical relationship between arousal and performance has long been reported in the psychological literature (Baumeister, 1984Baumeister R.F. Choking under pressure: self-consciousness and paradoxical effects of incentives on skillful performance.J. Pers. Soc.

The relation of strength of stimulus to rapidity of habit-formation.J. Comp. Neurol. Psychol. 1908; 18: 459-482Crossref Google Scholar). Keeping in mind that arousal is closely associated with motivation, behavioral economics has borrowed theories from psychology to explain incentive based decrements (Ariely et al., 2009Ariely D. Gneezy U. Loewenstein G. Mazar N. Large stakes and big mistakes.Rev. Econ. Stud. 2009; 76: 451-469Crossref Scopus (401) Google Scholar, Camerer et al., 2005Camerer C.F. Loewenstein G. Prelec D. Neuroeconomics: how neuroscience can inform economics.J. Econ. Lit. 2005; 43: 9-64Crossref Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). These psychological theories attempt to provide explanations as to why external stressors such as presence of an audience or social stereotypes might have detrimental effects on behavioral performance—commonly termed “choking under pressure” (Baumeister, 1984Baumeister R.F. Choking under pressure: self-consciousness and paradoxical effects of incentives on skillful performance.J. Pers. Soc. Psychol. 1984; 46: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar, Beilock et al., 2004Beilock S.L. Kulp C.A. Holt L.E. Carr T.H. More on the fragility of performance: choking under pressure in mathematical problem solving.J. Exp. Psychol. Gen. 2004; 133: 584-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). A number of theories have been proposed to account for the choking phenomenon, including distraction theories and explicit monitoring theories. Distraction theories propose that pressure creates a distracting environment that shifts attentional focus to task-irrelevant cues, such as worries about the situation and its consequences (Beilock and Carr, 2001Beilock S.L.

Test anxiety and direction of attention.Psychol. Bull. 1971; 76: 92-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). In contrast, explicit monitoring theories suggest that the presence of a stressor acts to wrest control of behavior from a habit-based instrumental system involved in the implementation of skilled motor acts, to a more goal-directed instrumental system in which actions must be selected in a deliberative manner (requiring on-going monitoring of performance) (Baumeister, 1984Baumeister R.F.

Psychol. 1979; 37: 2014-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). At the neural level, very little is known about the mechanisms underpinning performance decrements in stressful environments. Mobbs et al., 2009Mobbs D. Hassabis D. Seymour B. Marchant J.L. Weiskopf N. Dolan R.J. Frith C.D. Choking on the money: reward-based performance decrements are associated with midbrain activity.Psychol. Sci. 2009; 20: 955-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar found that the degree of subjects' midbrain activation during a challenging task was correlated with their performance decrement for large incentives. They interpreted this neural response as an “over-motivation” signal for the high rewards associated with successful task performance. Another region known to play an important role in mediating interactions between rewards and motor performance is the ventral striatum. A number of studies have found this region to be involved in mediating the effects of rewards on increases in motor performance (Kurniawan et al., 2010Kurniawan I.T. Seymour B. Talmi D. Yoshida W. Chater N. Dolan R.J. Choosing to make an effort: the role of striatum in signaling physical effort of a chosen action.J.

Disconnecting force from money: effects of basal ganglia damage on incentive motivation.Brain. 2008; 131: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The ventral striatum has been implicated in interactions between a Pavlovian system in which reflexive conditioned responses come to be elicited by a stimulus that predicts the subsequent delivery of a reward, and an instrumental system in which actions are selected flexibly in order to increase the probability of obtaining reward (Bray et al., 2008Bray S. Rangel A. Shimojo S. Balleine B. O'Doherty J.P. The neural mechanisms underlying the influence of pavlovian cues on human decision making.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 5861-5866Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, Dickinson and Balleine, 1994Dickinson A. Balleine B.W. Motivational control of goal-directed action.Anim. Learn.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In Pavlovian to instrumental transfer, instrumental responding for reward can be enhanced as a result of the presence of a reward predicting Pavlovian stimulus, an effect that is abolished in rodents following lesions of the ventral striatum (Corbit and Balleine, 2005Corbit L.H. Balleine B.W. Double dissociation of basolateral and central amygdala lesions on the general and outcome-specific forms of pavlovian-instrumental transfer.J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 962-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fMRI studies of humans have revealed activity in the ventral striatum during Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (Bray et al., 2008Bray S. Rangel A. Shimojo S. Balleine B. O'Doherty J.P. The neural mechanisms underlying the influence of pavlovian cues on human decision making.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 5861-5866Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, Talmi et al., 2008Talmi D. Seymour B. Dayan P. Dolan R.J. Human pavlovian-instrumental transfer.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). All of the above studies have focused on the role of ventral striatum in mediating enhancements in responding, as opposed to decrements. In contrast, in this study we aimed to investigate the role of the ventral striatum in mediating response decrements as a function of large incentives. To this end, we used a novel motor control paradigm in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants performed the highly-skilled motor task of controlling a virtual spring-mass system (Figure 1B ). This dynamic system was chosen because it was completely novel to participants, and thus allowed us to evaluate performance uncorrupted by participants' previous experiences or expertise (Dingwell et al., 2002Dingwell J.B. Mah C.D. Mussa-Ivaldi F.A. Manipulating objects with internal degrees of freedom: evidence for model-based control.J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 88: 222-235PubMed Google Scholar). During trials participants moved both their hand and the mass from a start position to a target 20 cm away. A successful trial consisted of both the hand and mass being placed in the target, subject to velocity constraints. The experiment took place on two consecutive days. On the first day of the experiment, participants trained on 500 repeated trials with the spring-mass system. After training, we determined participants' rates of success at various target sizes. This thresholding allowed us to tailor standard difficulty levels for each participant. On the second day, participants performed the testing phase and were scanned with fMRI while they controlled the spring-mass system with the purpose of obtaining reward. While in the magnet, on Day 2 of the experiment, participants performed trials for a range of incentives (i.e., $0, $5, $25, $50, $75, $100) and at two difficulty levels (easy and hard). Behavioral results from the training phase (Day 1) indicated that control of the spring-mass system was initially challenging for participants, but after repeated practice they were able to increase their performance (Figure 2). In the subsequent experiment, we found that participants exhibited peak performance over the range of incentive levels and the bulk of participants reached peak performance at an incentive level less than $100 (Figure 3A ). This variability in performance responses for incentives was likely due to participants' differences in subjective value for incentives (Ariely et al., 2009Ariely D. Gneezy U. Loewenstein G. Mazar N. Large stakes and big mistakes.Rev. Econ. Stud. 2009; 76: 451-469Crossref Scopus (401) Google Scholar). To account for differences in behavioral performance variance between participants, each participants' measures of performance were separately standardized (Z-scored) across incentive categories. We computed group statistics on behavioral responses to incentive using these standardized performance measures.Figure 3Behavioral Performance during ScanningShow full caption(A) Participants exhibited individual differences in the incentive level at which their performance peaked.(B) At the hard and combined difficulty levels, and not the easy level, we found that participants had greater performance in the middle range of incentive as compared to the extremes of incentive.(C) Dividing incentive levels, at the hard difficulty level, we found that performance improved with increasing incentives up to a point. Further increases in incentives significantly decreased performance relative to peak performance. Planned comparisons of performance, relative to performance in the middle range of incentives, found significant decrements at the extremes of incentive for the hard condition (∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001).

(C) Dividing incentive levels, at the hard difficulty level, we found that performance improved with increasing incentives up to a point. Further increases in incentives significantly decreased performance relative to peak performance. Planned comparisons of performance, relative to performance in the middle range of incentives, found significant decrements at the extremes of incentive for the hard condition (∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01; ∗∗∗p < 0.001). Error bars represent SEM. See also Figure S2. To examine participants' behavioral responses to incentive, we compared performance at the extremes of incentive with performance in the middle range of incentives (see the Data Analysis section for details). At the hard (t(17) = 2.20, p = 0.04) and combined (t(17) = 2.47, p = 0.02) difficulty levels, and not the easy level (t(17) = 0.42, p = 0.70), we found that participants had greater performance in the middle range of incentive as compared to the extremes of incentive (Figure 3B). We also found a significant interaction between these incentive categories and difficulty (F[1,68] = 6.30, p = 0.01). Further dividing incentive levels (Figure 3C), we found significant main effects of incentive on performance in the hard condition (F[2,51] = 5.07, p = 0.01), and not the easy (F[2,51] = 2.27, p = 0.11) or combined (F[2,51] = 2.10, p = 0.13) conditions. We again found a significant interaction between incentive categories and difficulty (F[2,102] = 3.60, p = 0.03). In the hard level we found that participants' performance improved with increasing incentive level up to a point; beyond this point, further increasing incentives significantly decreased performance relative to peak performance (Figure 3C). Because participants performed this task in the fMRI scanner, we were able to examine the underlying brain activity involved in generating their performance responses. Figure 4A shows that, at the time of incentive presentation, the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal in ventral striatum increased with the magnitude of incentive (cluster sizes > 100 voxels; right cluster peak: [x = 12; y = 12; Z = −6], T = 6.51; left cluster peak: [x = −21; y = 15; Z = −3], T = 5.59). Conversely, we found that striatal activation during the motor task decreased with respect to the magnitude of incentive (cluster sizes > 100 voxels; right cluster peak: [x = 21; y = 9; Z = −9], T = 4.15; left cluster peak: [x = −18; y = 6; z = −6], Z = 3.89). These results point to a rapid switching, in the direction of striatal activity, between the presentation of incentive and subsequent performance of the motor action. We performed a simulation of our fMRI design to confirm that the striatal deactivation response was not due to the BOLD response leaking from the incentive presentation phase into the motor task phase (Figures S1A and S1B available online). We also performed an analysis of our data to confirm that the striatal deactivation was not a physiological artifact (Figure S1C). Strikingly, the only brain region commonly active between the time of incentive presentation (Table S1) and the execution of the motor task (Table S2) was bilaterally encompassing ventral striatum (Table S3). Furthermore, additional whole brain analyses did not reveal any brain regions that were directly correlated with participants' parabolic behavioral performance or interactions between incentive level and task difficulty (see Supplemental Information for details, Figure S1E). These analyses provided us with further evidence of the ventral striatum's integral role in mediating participants' responses during performance for incentives. The idiosyncratic pattern of striatal activity we observed (i.e., activation at the time of incentive presentation and deactivation at the time of action) resembles that reported for participants experiencing potential monetary gains and losses (Tom et al., 2007Tom S.M.

The neural basis of loss aversion in decision-making under risk.Science. 2007; 315: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar, in conjunction with our results, led us to develop a new hypothesis regarding the role of ventral striatum in mediating performance decrements for large incentives: deactivation of ventral striatum during motor action reflects evaluation of the potential loss (of a presumed gain) that would arise from failure to successfully achieve the task. Essentially, larger incentives are framed as larger potential losses, and as these perceived potential losses increase (in the highest incentive conditions) they are manifested as performance decrements. Because this hypothesis is generated in part from a “reverse-inference” (Poldrack, 2006Poldrack R.A. Can cognitive processes be inferred from neuroimaging data?.Trends Cogn. Sci. (Regul. Ed.). 2006; 10: 59-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar), we needed to obtain additional evidence in order to provide direct empirical support. Our hypothesis led to the following predictions: (1) striatal deactivation at the time of motor action would predict the extent of individuals' decrements in behavioral performance; (2) activity in ventral striatum during motor action would relate to an individual's behavioral loss aversion (i.e., the more loss averse a participant, the greater her ventral striatal deactivation during motor action); and (3) a participant's degree of behavioral loss aversion would be predictive of her propensity to exhibit performance decrements for large incentives, as well as the level of incentive that resulted in peak performance. To test the first prediction, we examined the extent to which a participant's decrease in performance at the highest incentive level was related to her neural sensitivity to incentive. For this analysis we performed correlations between participants' behavioral performance at the $100 incentive level and activity in the striatum. Neural sensitivity to incentive was defined as the slope of the relationship between BOLD percent signal change and incentive level; a positive neural sensitivity corresponded to neural activation, whereas a negative activity was indicative of deactivation. In keeping with the first prediction, we found significant correlations between levels of striatal deactivation at the time of the motor task and performance decrements at the $100 incentive level (Figure 4B; r = 0.70; p = 0.001). Critically, no significant relationship between neural sensitivity and performance was found at the time of incentive presentation (r = 0.22; p = 0.38). Using a cross-product term in a multiple regression model, we also found a significant interaction between neural sensitivity during incentive presentation and the motor task and performance (statistics for interaction term: t(14) = 4.18; p = 0.001). To test the second prediction we recalled a subset of participants (n = 12) who originally participated in these experiments and tested them on a behavioral loss aversion task. This task was the same as that used by Tom et al., 2007Tom S.M. Fox C.R. Trepel C. Poldrack R.A.

This subset of participants was found to have a median λ estimate of 2.09 (interquartile range [IQR] 1.09). These values of λ are similar to those reported in previous studies (Bateman et al., 2005Bateman I. Kahneman D. Munro A. Starmer C. Sugden R.

We found significant correlations between increasing behavioral loss aversion and striatal deactivation during motor action (Figure 5A ; r = 0.60; p = 0.04; Figure S3). Importantly, we did not find a significant correlation between neural sensitivity during incentive presentation and participants' behavioral loss aversion (r = 0.30; p = 0.34). We also found a significant interaction between neural sensitivity during incentive presentation and the motor task and loss aversion (statistics for interaction term: t(8) = 2.40 p = 0.05). These results illustrate that differences in behavioral loss aversion were indicative of neural responses during motor action. To test the third prediction, and to reach an adequate sample size to test behavioral correlations, we included an additional 20 participants who performed the motor task, the behavioral loss aversion task, and a risk aversion task outside the fMRI scanner. A group comprised of both the subset of imaging participants (n = 12), and the additional participants (n = 20) had a median λ estimate of 2.10 (IQR 0.85). We found a highly significant (r = 0.53; p = 0.002) relationship between increasing behavioral loss aversion and the proclivity to show performance decrements in the hard difficulty level (Figure 5B), but not in the easy difficulty level (r = 0.22; p = 0.23). We also found a significant relationship (r = 0.36; p = 0.04) between decreasing behavioral loss aversion and the level of incentive resulting in peak behavioral performance in the hard difficulty level (Figure 5C), but not in the easy difficulty level (r = 0.24; p = 0.19). Those participants with greater behavioral loss aversion exhibited peak performance at lower incentive levels and more impaired performance for high incentives. The additional group of participants (n = 20) exhibited a wide range of λ's and separating these participants based on the degree of their loss aversion, we found that those that were less loss averse followed a monotonic response to incentives, whereas more loss averse participants exhibited the paradoxical response to incentives (Figure 5D). These results provide evidence that participants frame their performance for incentives, during highly skilled tasks, in terms of the loss of a presumed gain that would arise from failure. Moreover, this encoding of loss aversion drives participants' behavioral performance for incentive. Loss aversion represents a tendency to value losses greater than equal magnitude gains. Risk aversion, on the other hand, is a more general aversion to increased variance in potential gains or losses. To ensure a loss aversion-based hypothesis and not a general aversion to risk was responsible for our findings, we had participants in the follow-up experiment (n = 20) perform another decision-making task in which they made choices regarding risky gambles that did not include potential losses. Using participants' responses from this task we were able to calculate a measure α that represented their risk aversion. Participants had a median α estimate of 0.83 (IQR 0.20), indicating that they were on average risk averse. Importantly, no significant correlations were found between our behavioral measures of performance and risk aversion (Table 1). This provides further evidence that an individual's incentive resulting in peak performance and her performance decrements for large incentives are due specifically to loss aversion.Table 1Correlations between Prospect Theory Parameters and Performance for Participants in the Follow-Up ExperimentCorrelation with Loss Aversion (λ); n = 20Correlation with Risk Aversion (α); n = 20Performance at $100Incentive Resulting in Peak PerformancePerformance at $100Incentive Resulting in Peak PerformanceEasy difficultyr = 0.31r = 0.26r = 0.17r = 0.22p = 0.18p = 0.27p = 0.47p = 0.35Hard difficultyr = 0.61r = 0.44r = 0.18r = 0.10p = 0.004p = 0.05p = 0.45p = 0.67Each element of this table indicates the significance of a correlation between participants' loss aversion and risk aversion and performance measures at each difficulty level.

We used gender-specific multivariable regression models to identify factors independently associated with HIV testing in sexually active persons.Of 19,840 eligible persons, 80% consented to interviews and blood specimen collection. National HIV prevalence was 7.1% (95% CI 6.5-7.7). Among ever sexually active persons, 27.4% (95% CI 25.6-29.2) of men and 44.2% (95% CI 42.5-46.0) of women reported previous HIV testing. Among HIV-infected persons, 83.6% (95% CI 76.2-91.0) were unaware of their HIV infection. Among sexually active women aged 15-49 years, 48.7% (95% CI 46.8-50.6) had their last HIV test during antenatal care (ANC). In multivariable analyses, the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) for ever HIV testing in women ≥35 versus 15-19 years was 0.2 (95% CI: 0.1-0.3; p<0.0001). Other independent associations with ever HIV testing included urban residence (AOR 1.6, 95% CI: 1.2-2.0; p = 0.0005, women only), highest wealth index versus the four lower quintiles combined (AOR 1.8, 95% CI: 1.3-2.5; p = 0.0006, men only), and an increasing testing trend with higher levels of education. Missed opportunities for testing were identified during general or pregnancy-specific contacts with health facilities; 89% of adults said they would participate in home-based HIV testing.The vast majority of HIV-infected persons in Kenya are unaware of their HIV status, posing a major barrier to HIV prevention, care and treatment efforts. New approaches to HIV testing provision and education, including home-based testing, may increase coverage.

https://openalex.org/W1988699352,"Metabolism of cancer cells with pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) at its centre stage has assumed a prime significance in cancer research in recent times. Cancer cell metabolism, characterized by enhanced glucose uptake, production of lactate and anabolism is considered an ideal target for therapeutic interventions. Expression of PKM2 switches metabolism in favor of cancer cells, therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the hitherto unknown effect of resveratrol, a phytoalexin, on PKM2 expression and resultant implications on cancer metabolism. We observed that resveratrol down-regulated PKM2 expression by inhibiting mTOR signaling and suppressed cancer metabolism, adjudged by decreased glucose uptake, lactate production (aerobic glycolysis) and reduced anabolism (macromolecule synthesis) in various cancer cell lines. A contingent decrease in intracellular levels of ribose-5-phosphate (R5P), a critical intermediate of pentose phosphate pathway, accounted for a reduced anabolism. Consequently, the state of suppressed cancer metabolism resulted in decreased cellular proliferation. Interestingly, shRNA-mediated silencing of PKM2 inhibited glucose uptake and lactate production, providing evidence for the critical role of PKM2 and its mediation in the observed effects of resveratrol on cancer metabolism. Further, an over-expression of PKM2 abolished the observed effects of resveratrol, signifying the role of PKM2 downregulation as a critical function of resveratrol. The study reports a novel PKM2-mediated effect of resveratrol on cancer metabolism and provides a new dimension to its therapeutic potential."

Pb cation shows major affinity towards protein complexation and it has been used as modulator of protein-membrane interactions. We located the binding sites of Pb(II) with human serum (HSA) and bovine serum albumins (BSA) at physiological conditions, using constant protein concentration and various Pb contents. FTIR, UV-visible, CD, fluorescence and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) methods were used to analyse Pb binding sites, the binding constant and the effect of metal ion complexation on HSA and BSA stability and conformations. Structural analysis showed that Pb binds strongly to HSA and BSA via hydrophilic contacts with overall binding constants of K(Pb-HSA) = 8.2 (±0.8)×10(4) M(-1) and K(Pb-BSA) = 7.5 (±0.7)×10(4) M(-1). The number of bound Pb cation per protein is 0.7 per HSA and BSA complexes. XPS located the binding sites of Pb cation with protein N and O atoms.

We focused on the impact of glial exocytosis on sensory transduction in the retina. To this end, we generated transgenic mice to block exocytosis by Cre recombinase-dependent expression of the clostridial botulinum neurotoxin serotype B light chain, which cleaves vesicle-associated membrane protein 1-3. Ubiquitous and neuronal toxin expression caused perinatal lethality and a reduction of synaptic transmission thus validating transgene function. Toxin expression in Müller cells inhibited vesicular glutamate release and impaired glial volume regulation but left retinal histology and visual processing unaffected. Our model to study gliotransmission in vivo reveals specific functions of exocytotic glutamate release in retinal glia."

AF mitochondria exhibited a significant 30% decrease in respiratory rate during state 3, while enhancing the resting respiratory rate during State 4-oligo by 220%. The activity of individual electron transport complexes I, II and III were 107%, 65%, and 120% in AF mitochondria as compared to those isolated from control flies. The sharp decrease in complex II activity and modest increase in complexes I and III resulted in >60% reduction in superoxide leakage from AF mitochondria during both NAD(+)-linked state 3 and State 4-oligo respirations. These results provide evidence that flies with mitochondria exhibiting decreased succinate dehydrogenase activity and reduced superoxide leakage give flies an advantage for survival in long-term hypoxia."

Calcium and cAMP are two key regulators of whether axons are attracted or repelled by molecular gradients, but how these molecules interact to determine guidance responses remains unclear. Here, we constructed a mathematical model for the relevant signaling network, which explained a large range of previous biological data and made predictions for when axons will be attracted or repelled. We then confirmed these predictions experimentally, in particular showing that while small increases in cAMP levels promote attraction large increases do not, and that under some circumstances reducing cAMP levels promotes attraction. Together, these results show that a relatively simple mathematical model can quantitatively predict guidance decisions across a wide range of conditions, and that calcium and cAMP levels play a more complex role in these decisions than previously determined."

Rap1 relocalizes KRIT1 from microtubules to cell membranes to impact integrin activation, potentially important for CCM pathology. We report the 1.95 Å co-crystal structure of KRIT1 FERM domain in complex with Rap1. Rap1-KRIT1 interaction encompasses an extended surface, including Rap1 Switch I and II and KRIT1 FERM F1 and F2 lobes. Rap1 binds KRIT1-F1 lobe using a GTPase-ubiquitin-like fold interaction but binds KRIT1-F2 lobe by a novel interaction. Point mutagenesis confirms the interaction. High similarity between KRIT1-F2/F3 and talin is revealed. Additionally, the mechanism for FERM domains acting as GTPase effectors is suggested. Finally, structure-based alignment of each lobe suggests classification of FERM domains as ERM-like and TMFK-like (talin-myosin-FAK-KRIT-like) and that FERM lobes resemble domain ""modules."""
https://openalex.org/W2031208638,"The N-end rule pathway is a proteolytic system in which destabilizing N-terminal amino acids of short lived proteins are recognized by recognition components (N-recognins) as an essential element of degrons, called N-degrons. In eukaryotes, the major way to generate N-degrons is through arginylation by ATE1 arginyl-tRNA-protein transferases, which transfer Arg from aminoacyl-tRNA to N-terminal Asp and Glu (and Cys as well in mammals). We have shown previously that ATE1-deficient mice die during embryogenesis with defects in cardiac and vascular development. Here, we characterized the arginylation-dependent N-end rule pathway in cardiomyocytes. Our results suggest that the cardiac and vascular defects in ATE1-deficient embryos are independent from each other and cell-autonomous. ATE1-deficient myocardium and cardiomyocytes therein, but not non-cardiomyocytes, showed reduced DNA synthesis and mitotic activity ~24 h before the onset of cardiac and vascular defects at embryonic day 12.5 associated with the impairment in the phospholipase C/PKC-MEK1-ERK axis of Gα(q)-mediated cardiac signaling pathways. Cardiac overexpression of Gα(q) rescued ATE1-deficient embryos from thin myocardium and ventricular septal defect but not from vascular defects, genetically dissecting vascular defects from cardiac defects. The misregulation in cardiovascular signaling can be attributed in part to the failure in hypoxia-sensitive degradation of RGS4, a GTPase-activating protein for Gα(q). This study is the first to characterize the N-end rule pathway in cardiomyocytes and reveals the role of its arginylation branch in Gα(q)-mediated signaling of cardiomyocytes in part through N-degron-based, oxygen-sensitive proteolysis of G-protein regulators."
https://openalex.org/W2035743151,"Cross-species transmission and adaptation of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs) to humans have given rise to human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs). HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) were derived from SIVs that infected chimpanzee (SIVcpz) and sooty mangabey (SIVsm), respectively. The HIV-1 restriction factor SAMHD1 inhibits HIV-1 infection in human myeloid cells and can be counteracted by the Vpx protein of HIV-2 and the SIVsm lineage. However, HIV-1 and its ancestor SIVcpz do not encode a Vpx protein and HIV-1 has not evolved a mechanism to overcome SAMHD1-mediated restriction. Here we show that the co-evolution of primate SAMHD1 and lentivirus Vpx leads to the loss of the vpx gene in SIVcpz and HIV-1. We found evidence for positive selection of SAMHD1 in orangutan, gibbon, rhesus macaque, and marmoset, but not in human, chimpanzee and gorilla that are natural hosts of Vpx-negative HIV-1, SIVcpz and SIVgor, respectively, indicating that vpx drives the evolution of primate SAMHD1. Ancestral host state reconstruction and temporal dynamic analyses suggest that the most recent common ancestor of SIVrcm, SIVmnd, SIVcpz, SIVgor and HIV-1 was a SIV that had a vpx gene; however, the vpx gene of SIVcpz was lost approximately 3643 to 2969 years ago during the infection of chimpanzees. Thus, HIV-1 could not inherit the lost vpx gene from its ancestor SIVcpz. The lack of Vpx in HIV-1 results in restricted infection in myeloid cells that are important for antiviral immunity, which could contribute to the AIDS pandemic by escaping the immune responses."

During a sustained high-frequency transmission, exoendocytic coupling is critical for the maintenance of synaptic transmission. Here, we show that this homeostatic coupling is supported by cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) at the calyx of Held. This mechanism starts to operate after hearing onset during the second postnatal week, when PKG expression becomes upregulated in the brainstem. Pharmacological tests with capacitance measurements revealed that presynaptic PKG activity is supported by a retrograde signal cascade mediated by NO that is released by activation of postsynaptic NMDA receptors. Activation of PKG also upregulates phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, thereby accelerating endocytosis. Furthermore, presynaptic PKG activity upregulates synaptic fidelity during high-frequency transmission. We conclude that maturation of the PKG-dependent retrograde signal cascade strengthens the homeostatic plasticity for the maintenance of high-frequency synaptic transmission at the fast glutamatergic synapse."

Accumulated evidence indicates that LPA influences vascular cell functions, including smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation, migration, and dedifferentiation, which are controlled by LPA-induced gene expression (for review, see Ref. 4Cui M.Z.

Previously, we have shown that LPA markedly induces Egr-1 (early growth response gene-1) expression in vascular SMCs (5Cui M.Z. Laag E. Sun L. Tan M. Zhao G. Xu X. Lysophosphatidic acid induces early growth response gene-1 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells: CRE and SRE mediate the transcription.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Egr-1, a zinc finger transcription factor, activates a set of genes implicated in the pathogenesis of restenosis and atherosclerosis with subsequent thrombosis. The products of these genes include proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, growth factors, coagulation factors, and matricellular modulators, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-2, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, CD44, platelet-derived growth factor A- and B-chains, fibroblast growth factor-2, transforming growth factor-β1, tissue factor, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, urokinase-type plasminogen activator, 5-lipoxygenase, thrombospondin, and metalloproteinases (6Khachigian L.M.

Egr-1 is a major vascular pathogenic transcription factor in atherosclerosis and restenosis.Rev. Endocr. Metab. Disord. 2004; 5: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, Egr-1 plays a vital role in regulating the expression of a set of important genes, leading to vascular diseases. An important step toward understanding the mechanism of vascular diseases is understanding the intracellular mechanism by which Egr-1 expression is regulated in vascular cells in response to lipid mediators that are accumulated in the vascular environment. In a previous study, we demonstrated that transcriptional regulation controls LPA-induced egr-1 gene expression and that both the cAMP response element and serum response element motifs of the egr-1 promoter are required for LPA-induced egr-1 promoter activation (5Cui M.Z. Laag E. Sun L. Tan M. Zhao G. Xu X. Lysophosphatidic acid induces early growth response gene-1 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells: CRE and SRE mediate the transcription.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to determine the intracellular signaling pathway leading to LPA-induced Egr-1 expression. Our results demonstrate the roles of LPA receptors and the specific PKC and MAPK in regulation of Egr-1 expression in vascular SMCs. We discovered several previously unrevealed intracellular molecular links in the LPA signaling pathway and their functions in LPA-induced gene expression.

The antibody against Egr-1 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and antibodies against PKCδ and PKCθ were from BD Transduction Laboratories. Primers of rat LPA receptors used in conventional PCR and real-time PCR were from Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA). For conventional PCR, the following primers were used: LPA receptor 1 (LPA1), AGC TGC CTC TAC TTC CAG C (forward primer) and TTG CTG TGA ACT CCA GCC AG (reverse primer); LPA2, CCT ACC TCT TCC TCA TGT TC (forward primer) and TAA AGG GTG GAG TCC ATC AG (reverse primer); and LPA3, GGC AAG CGG ATG GAC TTT (forward primer) and CAT GTC CTC GTC CTT GTA CG (reverse primer).

SMCs were prepared from explants of excised aortas of rats as described previously (8Brock T.A. Alexander R.W. Ekstein L.S. Atkinson W.J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Angiotensin increases cytosolic free calcium in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells.Hypertension. 1985; 7: I105-I109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were made quiescent by incubation in serum-free DMEM for 48 h. LPA was dissolved in PBS, and a final concentration of 25 μm was used. Total cellular RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (6–8 μg) was subjected to denaturing electrophoresis on formaldehyde-agarose gels. RNA was blotted onto Nytran membranes (Schleicher & Schüll) and hybridized with radiolabeled cDNA probes as described previously (5Cui M.Z. Laag E. Sun L. Tan M. Zhao G. Xu X. Lysophosphatidic acid induces early growth response gene-1 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells: CRE and SRE mediate the transcription.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Rat SMCs were rinsed with cold PBS and lysed in Western blot lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 8 m urea, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and protease inhibitors) with sonication for 20 s on ice. Cellular proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). Membranes were then probed with the specific antibodies, and the specific protein bands were visualized by ECL Plus (GE Healthcare). Adenoviruses encoding PKCθ were constructed as previously described (9Cazzolli R. Craig D.L. Biden T.J. Schmitz-Peiffer C. Inhibition of glycogen synthesis by fatty acid in C2C12 muscle cells is independent of PKCα, PKCϵ, and PKCθ.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 282: E1204-E1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Adenoviral wild-type and dominant-negative PKCδ constructs were kindly provided by Dr. Motoi Ohba (Showa University, Tokyo, Japan). SMCs in DMEM containing 10% FBS were infected for 24 h with either wild-type or dominant-negative PKC isotypes. Expression of LPA receptor mRNA was evaluated by RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from SMCs using an RNeasy mini-prep kit (Qiagen). The first strand of cDNA was reverse-transcribed using the ThermoScript RT-PCR system. The cDNA products were amplified using GeneAmp PCR core reagents. The amplification conditions were as follows: 2 min at 95 °C; 25–31 cycles for 45 s at 95 °C, 45 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C; followed by a final extension for 5 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1.0% agarose gel. The primers were designed using Primer Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR was performed on an ABI 7300 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) under the following conditions: 95 °C for 10 min and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Cells were transfected with non-silencing, JNK1, or JNK2 siRNA (Qiagen) for 48 h using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. On day 3, cells were starved for 24 h prior to LPA treatment. The means ± S.E. were calculated using Excel statistical Software, and statistical significance (p value) was determined by Student's two-tailed t test. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We previously demonstrated that a transcriptional mechanism controls LPA-induced egr-1 gene expression (5Cui M.Z. Laag E. Sun L. Tan M. Zhao G. Xu X. Lysophosphatidic acid induces early growth response gene-1 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells: CRE and SRE mediate the transcription.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Our results further showed that nuclear serum response factor (SRF) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) mediate LPA-induced egr-1 gene transcription in SMC nuclei (5Cui M.Z. Laag E. Sun L. Tan M. Zhao G. Xu X. Lysophosphatidic acid induces early growth response gene-1 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells: CRE and SRE mediate the transcription.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the upstream intracellular signaling pathway, which leads to LPA-induced Egr-1 expression, has been elusive. To first determine whether MAPKs are involved in LPA-induced Egr-1 expression, we measured LPA-induced MAPK activation. Rat SMCs were starved for 48 h prior to LPA treatment. At various time points of LPA treatment, SMCs were washed with PBS and lysed for the detection of intracellular phosphorylation of various MAPKs: ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK. As shown in Fig. 1A, LPA markedly and transiently induced activation of ERK kinase (MEK), ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK in SMCs. The activation peaks of these kinases in SMCs by LPA were at ∼2–5 min. To determine which of these kinases are involved in LPA-induced Egr-1 expression, we tested whether pretreatment with the ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126, p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, or JNK inhibitor SP600125 had any effect on LPA-induced Egr-1 expression. As shown in Fig. 1B, pretreatment of SMCs with 2.5 μm U0126, but not with 2.5 μm SB203580, completely blocked LPA-induced Egr-1 mRNA expression. SP600125 dose-dependently blocked LPA-induced Egr-1 mRNA (Fig. 1, C and D). These data show that activation of MEK/ERK and JNK is required, but p38 does not play a role in LPA-induced egr-1 gene expression in SMCs. We next evaluated the effects of these specific inhibitors on LPA-induced Egr-1 protein synthesis. Consistent with the data shown in Fig. 1 (B–D), pretreatment of cells with 2.5 and 5.0 μm U0126 completely blocked LPA-induced Egr-1 protein expression; however, SB203580 at two effective doses (2.5 and 5.0 μm) had no effect on LPA-induced Egr-1 protein synthesis (Fig. 1E). We also observed that SP600125 dose-dependently blocked Egr-1 protein expression (Fig. 1, F and G). These results indicate that LPA activation of MEK/ERK and JNK is required for Egr-1 protein expression, whereas p38 MAPK does not have a role. Therefore, the data shown in Fig. 1 demonstrate that LPA-induced Egr-1 expression depends on the MEK/ERK and JNK cascades. To search for the upstream intracellular mediator that controls ERK and JNK MAPK activation, leading to LPA-induced Egr-1 expression, we examined the role of PKC in MAPK activation and Egr-1 synthesis. Pretreatment of SMCs with the general PKC inhibitor GF109203X dose-dependently blocked LPA-induced activation of MEK, ERK, and JNK (Fig. 2, A and B), as well as LPA-induced expression of Egr-1 mRNA and protein (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that PKC-mediated activation of MEK/ERK and JNK leads to LPA induction of Egr-1 expression. To determine the specific PKC isotype function in LPA induction of Egr-1 expression, we evaluated activation of specific PKC isotypes in SMCs in response to LPA stimulation. As shown in Fig. 3A, PKCδ and PKCθ were activated very rapidly and markedly by LPA, with phosphorylation peaks at ∼30 s and 2 min. However, there was no significant phosphorylation detected for other isotypes of PKC in response to LPA (Fig. 3A), suggesting that novel PKC group members PKCδ and PKCθ may be involved in LPA-induced Egr-1 expression. We next tested the roles of PKCδ and PKCθ in Egr-1 expression using the pharmacological compound rottlerin, which has been reported to inhibit the activity of PKCθ (10Springael C. Thomas S. Rahmouni S. Vandamme A. Goldman M. Willems F. Vosters O. Rottlerin inhibits human T cell responses.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 73: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and PKCδ (11Gschwendt M. Müller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Rottlerin, a novel protein kinase inhibitor.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, pretreatment of SMCs with 20 μm rottlerin completely blocked LPA-induced phosphorylation of PKCθ, PKCδ, ERK, and JNK, suggesting that activation of PKCθ and PKCδ may be involved in ERK and JNK activation. Conversely, in a reciprocal experiment, we tested whether ERK activation has a feedback effect on activation of PKCθ and PKCδ or has a role in activation of PKCθ and PKCδ. Our results show that 5 μm U0126, a specific MEK inhibitor, completely blocked activation of ERK, a substrate of MEK, but had no effect on phosphorylation of PKCθ and PKCδ (Fig. 3B), indicating that MEK and ERK are not the upstream regulators of either PKCθ or PKCδ and do not have an effect on activation of PKCθ and PKCδ. Furthermore, we observed that rottlerin at a low dose of 5 μm completely inhibited LPA-induced Egr-1 mRNA expression (Fig. 3C). Together, these data support the possibility that LPA-induced activity of PKCθ and PKCδ may regulate activation of their downstream molecules ERK and JNK, leading to Egr-1 expression. LPA activation of MAPK in various cell types has been reported (12Howe L.R. Marshall C.J.

Biol. 2003; 23: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar); however, the cross-talk between individual MAPK family members in LPA signaling is not well documented compared with that in growth factor signaling. Especially, MEK/ERK-regulated JNK activation in LPA signaling that leads to LPA induction of gene expression has not been revealed. We observed that U0126 at a low dose of 5 μm completely blocked activation of ERK (a substrate of MEK) and JNK, indicating that MEK/ERK activation is required for LPA-induced JNK phosphorylation and activation (Fig. 3B). This result, together with the results shown in Fig. 1, indicates that MEK/ERK-regulated JNK activation leads to LPA-induced gene expression. To the best of our knowledge, these data document that the cross-talk between the MEK/ERK pathway and the JNK pathway in LPA signaling contributes to LPA-induced gene expression as evidenced by Egr-1 expression. Because the pharmacological compound rottlerin has an inhibitory effect on PKCθ (10Springael C. Thomas S. Rahmouni S. Vandamme A. Goldman M. Willems F. Vosters O. Rottlerin inhibits human T cell responses.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 73: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and PKCδ (11Gschwendt M. Müller H.J. Kielbassa K. Zang R. Kittstein W. Rincke G. Marks F. Rottlerin, a novel protein kinase inhibitor.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar) and also considering the possible nonspecific effect of this pharmacological inhibitor, we further evaluated whether and which novel PKC mediates Egr-1 expression via activation of ERK and JNK by employing a dominant-negative approach. We determined the effect of overexpression of dominant-negative PKCδ in adenovirus on activation of ERK and JNK in SMCs as well as on expression of Egr-1 in comparison with the effect of dominant-negative PKCθ. In these experiments, we included wild-type PKCδ or PKCθ as a control. As shown in Fig. 4A, overexpression of dominant-negative PKCδ in SMCs significantly blocked LPA-induced activation of MEK, ERK, and JNK. In contrast, overexpression of dominant-negative PKCθ had no effect on activation of MEK, ERK, and JNK induced by LPA (Fig. 4B). We also observed that neither wild-type PKCδ nor wild-type PKCθ had a significant effect on MAPK activation (Fig. 4, A and B). These results indicate that activated PKCδ, but not activated PKCθ, is required for LPA-induced MEK, ERK, and JNK activation. We next evaluated the effects of dominant-negative PKCδ and dominant-negative PKCθ on Egr-1 expression. As shown in Fig. 4 (C and D), we found that overexpression of dominant-negative PKCδ, but not dominant-negative PKCθ, markedly blocked Egr-1 expression. Overexpression of wild-type PKCδ and PKCθ had no significant effect on Egr-1 expression (Fig. 4, C and D). Therefore, the results shown in Fig. 4 support the conclusion that LPA signaling leads to intracellular activation of both PKCδ and PKCθ, but only activated PKCδ, and not PKCθ, is required for MEK/ERK and JNK activation, which in turn, mediates Egr-1 expression. We found that the JNK inhibitor SP600125 dose-dependently blocked LPA-induced Egr-1 expression (Fig. 1, C, D, F, and G) and that ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor U0126 completely blocked JNK activation (Fig. 3B) and Egr-1 expression (Fig. 1, B and E). These results indicate that MEK-mediated JNK activation is required for LPA-induced Egr-1 expression. To confirm the JNK role in LPA-induced Egr-1 expression, we determined the isoforms of JNK expressed in rat SMCs and their functions in Egr-1 expression. As shown in Fig. 5A, JNK1 and JNK2, but not JNK3, were expressed in SMCs. We next tested whether knockdown of either JNK1 or JNK2 affects LPA-induced Egr-1 expression. Our results show that knockdown of JNK2, but not JNK1, blocked Egr-1 expression (Fig. 5B), indicating that JNK2 is required for the LPA signaling pathway leading to Egr-1 expression. LPA is known to mediate gene expression via its cognate G-protein-coupled receptors. Thus far, at least five G-protein-coupled LPA receptors have been reported (16Chun J. Hla T. Lynch K.R. Spiegel S. Moolenaar W.H. International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology. LXXVIII. Lysophospholipid receptor nomenclature.Pharmacol. Rev. 2010; 62: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). LPA1, LPA2, and LPA3 share very high homology (16Chun J. Hla T. Lynch K.R. Spiegel S. Moolenaar W.H. International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology. LXXVIII. Lysophospholipid receptor nomenclature.Pharmacol. Rev. 2010; 62: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). To determine which LPA receptors mediate the LPA signal leading to Egr-1 expression in SMCs, we performed RT-PCR analyses in various reaction cycles (25–31 cycles) to determine LPA receptor expression levels. As shown in Fig. 6A, we found that LPA1 was expressed predominantly in rat SMCs. The relative abundance of the receptors was determined by real-time PCR analysis with the following ratio: LPA1 ≫ LPA2 > LPA3 (Fig. 6B). To evaluate the role of the predominant form, LPA1, in LPA-induced kinase activation and Egr-1 expression, we pretreated SMCs with various doses of Ki16425, a potent inhibitor of LPA1 and LPA3. As shown in Fig. 6C, pretreatment with Ki16425 dose-dependently blocked activation of PKCδ, MEK, ERK, and JNK and expression of Egr-1, indicating that LPA1 is the major LPA receptor on the plasma membrane that mediates the LPA signal leading to the intracellular activation of PKCδ, which then activates the ERK and JNK pathways, leading to Egr-1 transcription in the nuclei of SMCs. LPA, a bioactive phospholipid produced by activated platelets, has been found to accumulate at high concentrations in atherosclerotic lesions. LPA is formed during the oxidation of LDL (2Siess W. Zangl K.J. Essler M. Bauer M. Brandl R. Corrinth C. Bittman R. Tigyi G. Aepfelbacher M.

Evidence has shown that accumulation of this lipid mediator may serve as an important risk factor for development of atherosclerosis and thrombosis (4Cui M.Z. Lysophosphatidic acid effects on atherosclerosis and thrombosis.Clin. Lipidol. 2011; 6: 413-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). LPA affects many functions of various vascular cells through mediating the expression of a variety of genes in these cells. In vascular SMCs, LPA induces expression of several genes, such as the coagulation initiator tissue factor (15Cui M.Z. Zhao G. Winokur A.L. Laag E. Bydash J.R. Penn M.S. Chisolm G.M. Xu X.

Therefore, understanding the intracellular signaling pathway leading to expression of the key regulatory transcription factor Egr-1 is essential to understanding how to prevent activation of the Egr-1 pathway and how to minimize the effect of Egr-1 and its downstream target gene products and ultimately to reduce atherogenesis and thrombosis. In this study, we focused on understanding the intracellular signaling cascade in LPA-stimulated Egr-1 expression in primary rat SMCs. Our data reveal an essential intracellular signaling cascade in the mediation of the LPA signal leading to Egr-1 up-regulation. We demonstrated that LPA via its cognate receptor LPA1 activates PKCδ, which in turn mediates activation of MEK/ERK and JNK, leading to Egr-1 transcription and translation. Previously, we established that the transcriptional regulation mechanism controls LPA-induced egr-1 gene expression (5Cui M.Z. Laag E. Sun L. Tan M. Zhao G. Xu X. Lysophosphatidic acid induces early growth response gene-1 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells: CRE and SRE mediate the transcription.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We showed that LPA regulates Egr-1 expression via transcription factors CREB and SRF, which bind to the cis-acting cAMP response element and serum response element in the egr-1 promoter region. These results established a novel role for CREB in mediating LPA-induced gene expression. Additionally, we also showed that LPA-induced protein-DNA binding activity is caused by LPA-induced rapid phosphorylation of CREB and SRF. In this study, performed to determine the intracellular regulatory mechanism upstream of Egr-1 transcription, our data reveal an essential role for PKCδ in LPA-induced Egr-1 expression. To our knowledge, although LPA signaling has been widely studied, the role of PKCδ in LPA-induced gene expression has been largely unknown.

However, the regulatory relationship between PKCδ and MAPK in the LPA signaling pathway has not been documented. Furthermore, the functional role of PKCδ-activated MAPK in LPA signaling has not been revealed. In this study, our data not only demonstrate that PKCδ mediates activation of MEK/ERK and JNK, but also reveal the functional role of the PKCδ-mediated MEK/ERK and JNK cascade that up-regulates the egr-1 gene. Therefore, these data provide the first evidence of PKCδ regulation of MAPK in the LPA signaling pathway and reveal for the first time that PKCδ-regulated MAPK (ERK and JNK) leads to LPA-induced gene expression in living cells, i.e. LPA induction of Egr-1 expression is mediated by the PKCδ-activated MAPK (ERK and JNK) pathway. In addition, our data demonstrate that the cross-talk between the MEK/ERK and JNK pathways contributes to LPA-induced gene expression. JNK2 is required for LPA-induced Egr-1 expression. We previously showed that LPA induces Egr-1 transcription via transactivation of the CREB and SRF transcription factors and binding of these transcription factors to the cis-elements in the egr-1 promoter in the nuclei of vascular SMCs (5Cui M.Z.

https://openalex.org/W2086581244,"Attention can modulate neural responses in sensory cortical areas and improve behavioral performance in perceptual tasks. However, the nature and purpose of these modulations remain under debate. Here we used voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) to measure V1 population responses while monkeys performed a difficult detection task under focal or distributed attention. We found that V1 responses at attended locations are significantly elevated relative to actively ignored or irrelevant locations, consistent with the hypothesis that an important goal of attention in V1 is to highlight task-relevant information. Surprisingly, these modulations were indistinguishable under focal and distributed attention, suggesting a minor or no role for attention as a mechanism for allocating limited representational resources in V1. The response elevation at attended locations is additive, is widespread, and starts shortly before stimulus onset. This elevation could contribute to spatial gating by biasing competition in subsequent processing stages in favor of attended stimuli."

https://openalex.org/W2058467341,"Previous studies have shown that DNA can be transferred from dying engineered cells to neighboring cells through the phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies, which leads to cellular transformation. Here, we provide evidence of an uptake of apoptotic-derived cervical cancer cells by human mesenchymal cells. Interestingly, HeLa (HPV 18+) or Ca Ski (HPV16+) cells, harboring integrated high-risk HPV DNA but not C-33 A cells (HPV-), were able to transform the recipient cells. Human primary fibroblasts engulfed the apoptotic bodies effectively within 30 minutes after co-cultivation. This mechanism is active and involves the actin cytoskeleton. In situ hybridization of transformed fibroblasts revealed the presence of HPV DNA in the nucleus of a subset of phagocytosing cells. These cells expressed the HPV16/18 E6 gene, which contributes to the disruption of the p53/p21 pathway, and the cells exhibited a tumorigenic phenotype, including an increased proliferation rate, polyploidy and anchorage independence growth. Such horizontal transfer of viral oncogenes to surrounding cells that lack receptors for HPV could facilitate the persistence of the virus, the main risk factor for cervical cancer development. This process might contribute to HPV-associated disease progression in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2023322810,"Plant photoreceptors transduce environmental light cues to downstream signaling pathways, regulating a wide array of processes during growth and development. Two major plant photoreceptors with critical roles in photomorphogenesis are phytochrome B (phyB), a red/far-red absorbing photoreceptor, and cryptochrome 1 (CRY1), a UV-A/blue photoreceptor. Despite substantial genetic evidence for cross-talk between phyB and CRY1 pathways, a direct interaction between these proteins has not been observed. Here, we report that Arabidopsis phyB interacts directly with CRY1 in a light-dependent interaction. Surprisingly, the interaction is light-dissociated; CRY1 interacts specifically with the dark/far-red (Pr) state of phyB, but not with the red light-activated (Pfr) or the chromophore unconjugated form of the enzyme. The interaction is also regulated by light activation of CRY1; phyB Pr interacts only with the unstimulated form of CRY1 but not with the photostimulated protein. Further studies reveal that a small domain extending from the photolyase homology region (PHR) of CRY1 regulates the specificity of the interaction with different conformational states of phyB. We hypothesize that in plants, the phyB/CRY1 interaction may mediate cross-talk between the red/far-red- and blue/UV-sensing pathways, enabling fine-tuning of light responses to different spectral inputs."
https://openalex.org/W2040792744,"Mitochondrial dysfunction and elevated reactive oxygen species are strongly implicated in both aging and various neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington disease (HD). Because reactive oxygen species can promote the selective oxidation of protein cysteine sulfhydryl groups to disulfide bonds we examined the spectrum of disulfide-bonded proteins that were specifically altered in a HD context. Protein extracts from PC12 cells overexpressing the amino-terminal fragment of the Huntingtin (Htt) protein with either a nonpathogenic or pathogenic polyglutamine repeat (Htt-103Q) were resolved by redox two-dimensional PAGE followed by mass spectrometry analysis. Several antioxidant proteins were identified that exhibited changes in disulfide bonding unique to Htt-103Q expressing cells. In particular, the antioxidant protein peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1) exhibited both decreased expression and hyperoxidation in response to mutant Htt expressed in either PC12 cells or immortalized striatal cells exposed to 3-nitropropionic acid. Ectopic expression of Prx1 in PC12 cells attenuated mutant Htt-induced toxicity. In contrast, short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of Prx1 potentiated mHtt toxicity. Furthermore, treatment with the dithiol-based compounds dimercaptopropanol and dimercaptosuccinic acid suppressed toxicity in both HD cell models, whereas monothiol compounds were relatively ineffective. Dimercaptopropanol treatment also prevented mutant Htt-induced loss of Prx1 expression in both cell models. Our studies reveal for the first time that pathogenic Htt can affect the expression and redox state of antioxidant proteins; an event countered by specific dithiol-based compounds. These findings should provide a catalyst to explore the use of dithiol-based drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1975760328,"Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) functions in diverse biological processes through the degradation of extracellular and non-extracellular matrix molecules. Because of its potential for tissue damage, there are several ways to regulate MMP-2 activity, including gene expression, compartmentalization, zymogen activation, and enzyme inactivation by extracellular inhibitors. Enzyme regulation through zymogen activation is important for the regulation of MMP-2 activity. In our previous studies, we showed that thrombin directly cleaved the propeptide of MMP-2 at specific sites for enzyme activation. We also demonstrated that heparan sulfate was required for thrombin-mediated activation of pro-MMP-2 by binding to thrombin, presumably through conformational changes at the active site of the enzyme. This suggests a regulatory mechanism for thrombin-mediated activation of pro-MMP-2. In this study, we found that MMP-2 formed a reduction-sensitive homodimer in a controlled manner and that Ca(2+) ion was essential for homodimerization of MMP-2. Homodimerization was not associated with protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of MMP-2. MMP-2 formed a homodimer through an intermolecular disulfide bond between Cys(102) and the neighboring Cys(102). Homodimerization of MMP-2 enhanced thrombin-mediated activation of pro-MMP-2. Moreover, the MMP-2 homodimer could cleave a small peptide substrate without removal of the propeptide. Taken together, our experimental data suggest a novel regulatory mechanism for pro-MMP-2 activation that is modulated through homodimerization of MMP-2."

https://openalex.org/W2041568178,"Background It has been found that gap junction-associated intracellular Ca2+ [Ca2+]i disturbance contributes to the arrhythmogenesis and hyperconstriction in diseased heart. However, whether functional gaps are also involved in the regulation of normal Ca2+ signaling, in particular the basal [Ca2+]i activities, is unclear. Methods and Results Global and local Ca2+ signaling and gap permeability were monitored in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) and freshly isolated mouse ventricular myocytes by Fluo4/AM and Lucifer yellow (LY), respectively. The results showed that inhibition of gap communication by heptanol, Gap 27 and flufenamic acid or interference of connexin 43 (Cx43) with siRNA led to a significant suppression of LY uptake and, importantly, attenuations of global Ca2+ transients and local Ca2+ sparks in monolayer NRVMs and Ca2+ sparks in adult ventricular myocytes. In contrast, overexpression of rat-Cx43 in NRVMs induced enhancements in the above measurements, and so did in HEK293 cells expressing rat Cx43. Additionally, membrane-permeable inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3 butyryloxymethyl ester) and phenylephrine, an agonist of adrenergic receptor, could relieve the inhibited Ca2+ signal and LY uptake by gap uncouplers, whereas blockade of IP3 receptor with xestospongin C or 2-aminoethoxydiphenylborate mimicked the effects of gap inhibitors. More importantly, all these gap-associated effects on Ca2+ signaling were also found in single NRVMs that only have hemichannels instead of gap junctions. Further immunostaining/immunoblotting single myocytes with antibody against Cx43 demonstrated apparent increases in membrane labeling of Cx43 and non-junctional Cx43 in overexpressed cells, suggesting functional hemichannels exist and also contribute to the Ca2+ signaling regulation in cardiomyocytes. Conclusions These data demonstrate that Cx43-associated gap coupling plays a role in the regulation of resting Ca2+ signaling in normal ventricular myocytes, in which IP3/IP3 receptor coupling is involved. This finding may provide a novel regulatory pathway for mediation of spontaneous global and local Ca2+ activities in cardiomyocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2050977604,"Background Retinoids are a class of compounds that are chemically related to vitamin A, which is an essential nutrient that plays a key role in vision, cell growth and differentiation. In vivo, retinoids must bind with specific proteins to perform their necessary functions. Plasma retinol-binding protein (RBP) and epididymal retinoic acid binding protein (ERABP) carry retinoids in bodily fluids, while cellular retinol-binding proteins (CRBPs) and cellular retinoic acid-binding proteins (CRABPs) carry retinoids within cells. Interestingly, although all of these transport proteins possess similar structures, the modes of binding for the different retinoid ligands with their carrier proteins are different. Methodology/Principal Findings In this work, we analyzed the various retinoid transport mechanisms using structure and sequence comparisons, binding site analyses and molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that in the same family of proteins and subcellular location, the orientation of a retinoid molecule within a binding protein is same, whereas when different families of proteins are considered, the orientation of the bound retinoid is completely different. In addition, none of the amino acid residues involved in ligand binding is conserved between the transport proteins. However, for each specific binding protein, the amino acids involved in the ligand binding are conserved. The results of this study allow us to propose a possible transport model for retinoids. Conclusions/Significance Our results reveal the differences in the binding modes between the different retinoid-binding proteins."

Previous studies have established that, in response to ER stress, ATF6α translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of ER stress response genes upon binding sequence specifically to ER stress response enhancer elements in their promoters. In this study, we investigate the biochemical mechanism by which ATF6α activates transcription. By exploiting a combination of biochemical and multidimensional protein identification technology-based mass spectrometry approaches, we have obtained evidence that ATF6α functions at least in part by recruiting to the ER stress response enhancer elements of ER stress response genes a collection of RNA polymerase II coregulatory complexes, including the Mediator and multiple histone acetyltransferase complexes, among which are the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) and Ada-Two-A-containing (ATAC) complexes.

GAT-ADCS is found in eukaryotic organisms autonomous for folate biosynthesis, such as plants or parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa. Based on an automated screening to search for new inhibitors of folate biosynthesis, we found that rubreserine was able to inhibit the glutamine amidotransferase activity of the plant GAT-ADCS with an apparent IC(50) of about 8 μM. The growth rates of Arabidopsis thaliana, Toxoplasma gondii, and Plasmodium falciparum were inhibited by rubreserine with respective IC(50) values of 65, 20, and 1 μM. The correlation between folate biosynthesis and growth inhibition was studied with Arabidopsis and Toxoplasma. In both organisms, the folate content was decreased by 40-50% in the presence of rubreserine. In both organisms, the addition of p-aminobenzoate or 5-formyltetrahydrofolate in the external medium restored the growth for inhibitor concentrations up to the IC(50) value, indicating that, within this range of concentrations, rubreserine was specific for folate biosynthesis. Rubreserine appeared to be more efficient than sulfonamides, antifolate drugs known to inhibit the invasion and proliferation of T. gondii in human fibroblasts. Altogether, these results validate the use of the bifunctional GAT-ADCS as an efficient drug target in eukaryotic cells and indicate that the chemical structure of rubreserine presents interesting anti-parasitic (toxoplasmosis, malaria) potential."
https://openalex.org/W2153366778,"The dystrophin complex is a multimolecular membrane-associated protein complex whose defects underlie many forms of muscular dystrophy. The dystrophin complex is postulated to function as a structural element that stabilizes the cell membrane by linking the contractile apparatus to the extracellular matrix. A better understanding of how this complex is organized and localized will improve our knowledge of the pathogenic mechanisms of diseases that involve the dystrophin complex. In a Caenorhabditis elegans genetic study, we demonstrate that CTN-1/α-catulin, a cytoskeletal protein, physically interacts with DYB-1/α-dystrobrevin (a component of the dystrophin complex) and that this interaction is critical for the localization of the dystrophin complex near dense bodies, structures analogous to mammalian costameres. We further show that in mouse α-catulin is localized at the sarcolemma and neuromuscular junctions and interacts with α-dystrobrevin and that the level of α-catulin is reduced in α-dystrobrevin-deficient mouse muscle. Intriguingly, in the skeletal muscle of mdx mice lacking dystrophin, we discover that the expression of α-catulin is increased, suggesting a compensatory role of α-catulin in dystrophic muscle. Together, our study demonstrates that the interaction between α-catulin and α-dystrobrevin is evolutionarily conserved in C. elegans and mammalian muscles and strongly suggests that this interaction contributes to the integrity of the dystrophin complex."
https://openalex.org/W2076242581,"Background/Purpose The effect of low-dose bisphenol A (BPA) exposure on human reproductive health is still controversial. To better understand the molecular basis of the effect of BPA on human reproductive health, a genome-wide screen was performed using human foreskin fibroblast cells (hFFCs) derived from child hypospadias (HS) patients to identify novel targets of low-dose BPA exposure. Methodology/Principal Findings Gene expression profiles of hFFCs were measured after exposure to 10 nM BPA, 0.01 nM 17β-estradiol (E2) or 1 nM 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) for 24 h. Differentially expressed genes were identified using an unpaired Student's t test with P value cut off at 0.05 and fold change of more than 1.2. These genes were selected for network generation and pathway analysis using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis, Pathway Express and KegArray. Seventy-one genes (42 downregulated and 29 upregulated) were identified as significantly differentially expressed in response to BPA, among which 43 genes were found to be affected exclusively by BPA compared with E2 and TCDD. Of particular interest, real-time PCR analysis revealed that the expression of matrix metallopeptidase 11 (MMP11), a well-known effector of development and normal physiology, was found to be inhibited by BPA (0.47-fold and 0.37-fold at 10 nM and 100 nM, respectively). Furthermore, study of hFFCs derived from HS and cryptorchidism (CO) patients (n = 23 and 11, respectively) indicated that MMP11 expression was significantly lower in the HS group than in the CO group (0.25-fold, P = 0.0027). Conclusions/Significance This present study suggests that an involvement of BPA in the etiology of HS might be associated with the downregulation of MMP11. Further study to elucidate the function of the novel target genes identified in this study during genital tubercle development might increase our knowledge of the effects of low-dose BPA exposure on human reproductive health."
https://openalex.org/W1999173328,"Rhodopseudomonas palustris metabolizes aromatic compounds derived from lignin degradation products and has the potential for bioremediation of xenobiotic compounds. We recently identified four possible solute-binding proteins in R. palustris that demonstrated binding to aromatic lignin monomers. Characterization of these proteins in the absence and presence of the aromatic ligands will provide unprecedented insights into the specificity and mode of aromatic ligand binding in solute-binding proteins. Here, we report the thermodynamic and structural properties of the proteins with aromatic ligands using isothermal titration calorimetry, small/wide angle x-ray scattering, and theoretical predictions. The proteins exhibit high affinity for the aromatic substrates with dissociation constants in the low micromolar to nanomolar range. The global shapes of the proteins are characterized by flexible ellipsoid-like structures with maximum dimensions in the 80-90-Å range. The data demonstrate that the global shapes remained unaltered in the presence of the aromatic ligands. However, local structural changes were detected in the presence of some ligands, as judged by the observed features in the wide angle x-ray scattering regime at q ~0.20-0.40 Å(-1). The theoretical models confirmed the elongated nature of the proteins and showed that they consist of two domains linked by a hinge. Evaluation of the protein-binding sites showed that the ligands were found in the hinge region and that ligand stabilization was primarily driven by hydrophobic interactions. Taken together, this study shows the capability of identifying solute-binding proteins that interact with lignin degradation products using high throughput genomic and biophysical approaches, which can be extended to other organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2000872229,"During nervous system development, neuronal growth, migration, and functional morphogenesis rely on the appropriate control of the subcellular cytoskeleton including microtubule dynamics. Stathmin family proteins play major roles during the various stages of neuronal differentiation, including axonal growth and branching, or dendritic development. We have shown previously that stathmins 2 (SCG10) and 3 (SCLIP) fulfill distinct, independent and complementary regulatory roles in axonal morphogenesis. Although the two proteins have been proposed to display the four conserved phosphorylation sites originally identified in stathmin 1, we show here that they possess distinct phosphorylation sites within their specific proline-rich domains (PRDs) that are differentially regulated by phosphorylation by proline-directed kinases involved in the control of neuronal differentiation. ERK2 or CDK5 phosphorylate the two proteins but with different site specificities. We also show for the first time that, unlike stathmin 2, stathmin 3 is a substrate for glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3β both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, stathmin 3 phosphorylated at its GSK-3β target site displays a specific subcellular localization at neuritic tips and within the actin-rich peripheral zone of the growth cone of differentiating hippocampal neurons in culture. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3β induces a redistribution of stathmin 3, but not stathmin 2, from the periphery toward the Golgi region of neurons. Stathmin proteins can thus be either regulated locally or locally targeted by specific phosphorylation, each phosphoprotein of the stathmin family fulfilling distinct and specific roles in the control of neuronal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2083661051,"Previous studies suggest that up-regulation of Ras signaling in neurons promotes gliosis and astrocytoma formation in a cell nonautonomous manner. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. To address this question, we generated compound mice (LSL Kras G12D/+;CamKII-Cre) that express oncogenic Kras from its endogenous locus in postmitotic neurons after birth. These mice developed progressive gliosis, which is associated with hyperactivation of Ras signaling pathways. Microarray analysis identified S100A8 and S100A9 as two secreted molecules that are significantly overexpressed in mutant cortices. In contrast to their usual predominant expression in myeloid cells, we found that overexpression of S100A8 and S100A9 in the mutant cortex is primarily in neurons. This neuronal expression pattern is associated with increased infiltration of microglia in mutant cortex. Moreover, purified S100A8-S100A9 but not S100A8 or S100A9 alone promotes growth of primary astrocytes in vitro through both TLR4 and receptor of advanced glycation end product receptors. In summary, our results identify overexpression of S100A8-S100A9 in neurons as an early step in oncogenic Kras-induced gliosis. These molecules expressed in nonhematopoietic cells may be involved in tumorigenesis at a stage much earlier than what has been reported previously."
https://openalex.org/W1979468270,"Genetic loci on New Zealand Black (NZB) chromosomes 1 and 13 play a significant role in the development of lupus-like autoimmune disease. We have previously shown that C57BL/6 (B6) congenic mice with homozygous NZB chromosome 1 (B6.NZBc1) or 13 (B6.NZBc13) intervals develop anti-nuclear antibodies and mild glomerulonephritis (GN), together with increased T and B cell activation. Here, we produced B6.NZBc1c13 bicongenic mice with both intervals, and demonstrate several novel phenotypes including: marked plasmacytoid and myeloid dendritic cell expansion, and elevated IgA production. Despite these changes, only minor increases in anti-nuclear antibody production were seen, and the severity of GN was reduced as compared to B6.NZBc1 mice. Although bicongenic mice had increased levels of baff and tnf-α mRNA in their spleens, the levels of IFN-α-induced gene expression were reduced. Splenocytes from bicongenic mice also demonstrated reduced secretion of IFN-α following TLR stimulation in vitro. This reduction was not due to inhibition by TNF-α and IL-10, or regulation by other cellular populations. Because pDC in bicongenic mice are chronically exposed to nuclear antigen-containing immune complexes in vivo, we examined whether repeated stimulation of mouse pDC with TLR ligands leads to impaired IFN-α production, a phenomenon termed TLR tolerance. Bone marrow pDC from both B6 and bicongenic mice demonstrated markedly inhibited secretion of IFN-α following repeated stimulation with a TLR9 ligand. Our findings suggest that the expansion of pDC and production of anti-nuclear antibodies need not be associated with increased IFN-α production and severe kidney disease, revealing additional complexity in the regulation of autoimmunity in systemic lupus erythematosus."
https://openalex.org/W2047791077,"Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is an important scaffold protein that mediates a variety of cellular responses to integrin stimulation by extracellular matrix proteins. Mice with epidermis-restricted inactivation of the Ilk gene exhibit pleiotropic phenotypic defects, including impaired hair follicle morphogenesis, reduced epidermal adhesion to the basement membrane, compromised epidermal integrity, as well as wasting and failure to thrive leading to perinatal death. To better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that cause such a broad range of alterations, we investigated the impact of Ilk gene inactivation on the epidermis transcriptome. Microarray analysis showed over 700 differentially regulated mRNAs encoding proteins involved in multiple aspects of epidermal function, including keratinocyte differentiation and barrier formation, inflammation, regeneration after injury, and fundamental epidermal developmental pathways. These studies also revealed potential effects on genes not previously implicated in ILK functions, including those important for melanocyte and melanoblast development and function, regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, and homeobox genes. This study shows that ILK is a critical regulator of multiple aspects of epidermal function and homeostasis, and reveals the previously unreported involvement of ILK not only in epidermal differentiation and barrier formation, but also in melanocyte genesis and function."

A number of observations show that the vasculature is an important component of neural stem cell niches. In the developing CNS, nervous and vascular systems are both derived from the neural tube (1Temple S. The development of neural stem cells.Nature. 2001; 414: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells and neural stem cells appear at the same stages during development and are co-localized in the neural geminal zones (2Zerlin M. Goldman J.E. Interactions between glial progenitors and blood vessels during early postnatal corticogenesis. Blood vessel contact represents an early stage of astrocyte differentiation.J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 387: 537-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Invasion of spouts from the perineural vascular plexus into the ventral region of the neural tube are associated with the proliferation of neuroepithelium. In the adult brain, neural stem cells and their progeny in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle (LV) and in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus lie close to the blood vessels (3Alvarez-Buylla A. Lim D.A. For the long run. Maintaining germinal niches in the adult brain.Neuron. 2004; 41: 683-686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). It has been shown that neurogenesis and angiogenesis are coupled processes in subgranular zone (4Palmer T.D. Willhoite A.R. Gage F.H. Vascular niche for adult hippocampal neurogenesis.J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 425: 479-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). In rostral migratory stream, blood vessels are tightly associated with the newborn SVZ neuroblasts and are involved in their migration (5Tavazoie M. Van der Veken L. Silva-Vargas V. Louissaint M. Colonna L. Zaidi B. Garcia-Verdugo J.M. Doetsch F. A specialized vascular niche for adult neural stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Similarly, in the olfactory bulb, blood vessels serve as scaffolding for radial migration of neural progenitor cells (6Bovetti S. Hsieh Y.C. Bovolin P. Perroteau I. Kazunori T. Puche A.C. Blood vessels form a scaffold for neuroblast migration in the adult olfactory bulb.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5976-5980Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). After ischemic insult, neuroblasts of the SVZ are also found migrating along the sides of blood vessels toward the damaged sites (7Yamashita T. Ninomiya M. Hernández Acosta P. García-Verdugo J.M. Sunabori T. Sakaguchi M. Adachi K. Kojima T. Hirota Y. Kawase T. Araki N. Abe K. Okano H. Sawamoto K. Subventricular zone-derived neuroblasts migrate and differentiate into mature neurons in the post-stroke adult striatum.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 6627-6636Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Early studies suggested that brain endothelial cells influenced NS/P cells through the action of their secreted factors. Indeed, in vitro studies have shown that diffusible factors from endothelial cells maintain and promote NS/P cell self-renewal (8Shen Q. Goderie S.K. Jin L. Karanth N. Sun Y. Abramova N. Vincent P. Pumiglia K. Temple S.

It was recently demonstrated that neural stem cells and transit-amplifying cells in the LV-SVZ directly contact blood vessels at sites devoid of coverage by astrocyte endfeet and pericyte (5Tavazoie M. Van der Veken L. Silva-Vargas V. Louissaint M. Colonna L. Zaidi B. Garcia-Verdugo J.M. Doetsch F. A specialized vascular niche for adult neural stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). LV-SVZ neurogenesis and injury-induced regeneration occur at these specialized neurovasculature contact sites (5Tavazoie M. Van der Veken L. Silva-Vargas V. Louissaint M. Colonna L. Zaidi B. Garcia-Verdugo J.M. Doetsch F. A specialized vascular niche for adult neural stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 10Shen Q.

A quantitative analysis of niche cell-cell interactions.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 289-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). An important regulatory mechanism for LV-SVZ neurogenesis may lie within the cell contact interface between the blood vessels and the NS/P cells. Communication between endothelial cells and NS/P cells appears to be a two-way street, each cell type regulates the behavior of the other. It was shown that NS/P cell-derived nitric oxide induces the endothelial expression of VEGF and BDNF (11Li Q. Ford M.C. Lavik E.B. Madri J.A. Modeling the neurovascular niche. VEGF- and BDNF-mediated cross-talk between neural stem cells and endothelial cells. An in vitro study.J. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 84: 1656-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). BDNF and VEGF in turn activate brain endothelial cell angiogenesis. Nitric oxide also stimulates NS/P cell proliferation by activating endothelial NOS (11Li Q. Ford M.C. Lavik E.B. Madri J.A. Modeling the neurovascular niche. VEGF- and BDNF-mediated cross-talk between neural stem cells and endothelial cells. An in vitro study.J. Neurosci. Res. 2006; 84: 1656-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This may represent one mechanism for reciprocal regulation between neurogenesis and angiogenesis. The cellular interaction mechanisms at NS/P cell-blood vessel direct contact sites are largely unexplored. A better understanding of the molecular signals that mediate interactions between NS/P cells and brain endothelial (bEND) cells would be important not only for the maintenance and differentiation of NS/P cells but also for blood vessel regulation. In the present studies we explored the interaction mechanisms between NS/P cells and bEND cells during direct cell contact. We found that NS/P cells induce an endothelial signaling pathway and lead to the production of cytokines/chemokines. Interestingly these endothelial responses were critically dependent on the expression of a type II transmembrane serine protease in NS/P cells and involve an endothelial Gs protein signal. NS/P cells were differentiated from the Sox1-GFP knock-in mouse ES cells (46C ES cells, obtained from Dr. Austin Smith at University of Edinburgh, UK (12Ying Q.L. Stavridis M. Griffiths D. Li M. Smith A. Conversion of embryonic stem cells into neuroectodermal precursors in adherent monoculture.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar)). Differentiation of NS/P cells was carried out by placing 46C ES cells on a gelatin-coated surface in neuronal differentiation medium (referred to as N2B27 medium) as described previously (13Fang J.D. Chou H.C. Tung H.H. Huang P.Y. Lee S.L. Endogenous expression of matriptase in neural progenitor cells promotes cell migration and neuron differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 5667-5679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). GFP+ NS/P cells were collected on day 6 using an ARIA fluorescence-activated cell sorter (BD Biosciences) and were used in the co-culture experiments. For neurosphere culture, 46C ES cell-derived NS/P cells were cultured on an uncoated surface for 6 days. The Sox1-GFP-positive NS/P cell spheroids were then collected. The day 14 mouse embryonic neurocortex neurospheres were purchased from STEMCELL Technologies (Vancouver, Canada). Adult NS/P cells were isolated from SVZ of the LV from 8–12-week-old male FVB mouse as described previously (13Fang J.D. Chou H.C. Tung H.H. Huang P.Y. Lee S.L. Endogenous expression of matriptase in neural progenitor cells promotes cell migration and neuron differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 5667-5679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); the mouse brain endothelial cell line bEnd.3 was purchased from the Bioscience Collection and Research Center (Hsinchu, Taiwan) and was routinely maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. For cell-cell contact co-culture, bEnd.3 cells were plated on 100-mm2 cell culture dishes the previous day to allow attachment. The medium was removed, the cells were washed and changed to N2B27 medium, and NS/P cells were then laid on the top of the attached bEnd.3 cells. Over 90% of NS/P cells attached to bEnd.3 cells in 2–3 h. Twenty-four hours later, NS/P cells were detached from bEnd.3 cells by repeated pipetting, which removed almost all the NS/P cells without detaching bEnd.3 cells as monitored microscopically and by GFP fluorescent of NS/P cells. Cell purity was examined further by RT-PCR for expression of endothelial marker FLK1 and the absence of neural stem/progenitor molecule nestin. After removing detached NS/P cells, bEnd.3 cells were detached from the culture dish with trypsin. All of the cells were then collected by centrifugation. For Fig. 2B, NS/P cells and bEnd.3 cells were mixed and seeded on a coverslip in endothelial cultural medium containing low serum (1%). After the cells attached (within 3 h), the medium was replaced with N2B27 medium and co-cultured for 24 h. For noncontact co-culture, bEnd.3 cells were allowed to attach overnight to the 6-well plate; Falcon Transwells with pore sizes of 8 μm (BD Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were placed on each well, and Sox1-GFP+ NS/P cells were then added into the Transwell. Twenty-four hours later, the Transwell was removed, and bEnd.3 cells were collected as described above. Reagents for cell culture were all from Invitrogen. In cultures where toxin or inhibitor was tested, they were added directly to the medium. Pertussis toxin (PTX), cholera toxin (CTX), and SB203580 were from Sigma. The recombinant mouse MTP protein (purchased from R & D System) is the catalytic serine protease domain and has specific activity >4,000 pmol/min/μg supplied by the manufacturer. The recombinant MTP protein was either added directly to the medium or coated on the surface of culture dishes prior seeding bEnd.3 cells. Total RNA was prepared using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA integrity was assessed by electrophoresis, and RNA concentration was measured with a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using Superscript III reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primers (Invitrogen). The resulting cDNA was then used in PCRs. Gene-specific primers were as follows: S15 (mouse ribosomal protein S15): forward, 5′-TTCCGCAAGTTCACCTACC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGCTTCACGGGTTTGTAGGT-3′; MTP: forward, 5′-CACTTCCATTATCGGAATGTGCG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGATGTCGCCGGTCAGTATTGGTTATCA-3′; IL6: forward, 5′-GTTGTGCAATGGCAATTCTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGGTCTTGGTCCTTAGCCAC-3′; FLK1 (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2): forward, 5′-CC AAAAACCAATATGCCCTGAT-3′, and reverse, 5′-TCTC TCAGTACAATGCCTGAATCTTC-3′. IL24: forward, 5′-GATGACATCACAAGCATCCG-3′, and reverse, 5′-ATTTCTGCATCCAGGTCAGG-3′; CXC motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10): forward, 5′-ATGAACCCAAGTGCTGCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTCATCGTGGCAATGATCTC-3′; and nestin: forward, 5′-GGGAGCTCGGAGCCCAAGGA-3′, and reverse, 5′-GGGCATGGCTGCCCTCATGG-3′. Transfection of siRNA or mammalian expression plasmid was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (13Fang J.D. Chou H.C. Tung H.H. Huang P.Y. Lee S.L. Endogenous expression of matriptase in neural progenitor cells promotes cell migration and neuron differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 5667-5679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). MTP knockdown or overexpression was checked by RT-PCR or Western blot. The siRNA against mouse St14 and a control siRNA with no target (nonsilencing siRNA) were purchased from Qiagen. The MTP overexpression plasmid is a pSPORT6-CMV vector carrying the full-length mouse MTP cDNA. Cell lysates were prepared in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, and phosphatase inhibitors. After 10 min of centrifugation at 13,000 × g, the supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined by SuperSignal® West Pico protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. An equal amount of protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot as described (14Lee S.L. Dickson R.B. Lin C.Y. Activation of hepatocyte growth factor and urokinase/plasminogen activator by matriptase, an epithelial membrane serine protease.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36720-36725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Antibodies to p38 MAP kinase, phospho-p38 MAP kinase, PKCα, and phospho-PKCα were all from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Cell staining followed the procedure described previously (13Fang J.D. Chou H.C. Tung H.H. Huang P.Y. Lee S.L. Endogenous expression of matriptase in neural progenitor cells promotes cell migration and neuron differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 5667-5679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were seeded on coverslips. After culture, they were fixed, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and blocked with 4% horse serum. After incubation with primary antibody, the cells were then incubated with green or red fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies. The cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI and analyzed using epifluorescence microscope (Olympus BX51). Cytokines released into the culture medium was assayed by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions. ELISA for mouse IL6, mouse IL24, and mouse CXCL10 were from Invitrogen, UCSN Life Science Inc. (Wuhan, PRC), and R & D Systems, respectively. Purified recombinant protein of each cytokine was used to obtain a standard curve for each assay to determine the concentration of each cytokine in the cell conditioned medium. GTPase activity of cell lysates was measured using a colorimetric assay kit (Innova Biosciences, Cambridge, UK) following the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, cell lysate or buffer was mixed with GTP substrate: the PiColorLock Gold reagent mix. The stabilizer was then added and incubated for 30 min. The absorbance was measured at 650-nm wavelength. A phosphate standard included in the package was used to calculate the specific GTPase activity in each sample of cell lysate. The data are presented as means ± S.D. derived from three to five independent experiments. Two-group t test was used for comparison between groups. For multiple-group comparisons, data were tested by one-way analysis of variance, and Bonferroni adjustment was used for within group comparisons. NS/P cells were seeded on PDL/laminin-coated culture dishes and cultured in N2B27 medium in the absence or presence of recombinant IL6 protein or the conditioned medium before or after IL6 depletion. The medium was changed every other day and cells were harvested after 7 days of culture. The conditioned medium of NS/P cell-bEND cell contact co-culture were harvested after 24-hours and concentrated by Ultra-4 molecular cutoff at 5 kDa (Millipore-Amicon). For IL6 depletion, the concentrated conditioned medium was incubated with IL6 antibody, and the antibody-bond fraction was then removed by protein-A agarose beads. Depletion of IL6 was confirmed by ELISA. NS/P cells cultured directly on bEND cells attached to bEND cells after short incubation. Fig. 1A shows that expression of IL6, IL24, and CXCL10 in bEND cells was induced by the attached NS/P cells. Expression of endothelial molecule VEGF receptor 2 (FLK1) in bEND cells collected after contact co-culture with NS/P cells was similar to that in bEND cells without co-culture. The NS/P marker nestin was not detected in bEND cells after contact co-culture with NS/P cells. The expression of FLK1 and nestin indicated that the endothelial cells collected after contact co-culture were substantially free of NS/P cells. IL6, IL24, or CXCL10 were undetectable in NS/P cells (Fig. 1A, NPC) whether they were cultured without (Fig. 1A, No Co-Cult) or with (Fig. 1A, Co-Cult) bEND cells. Brain endothelial cells (Fig. 1A, bEND) cultured alone (Fig. 1, A, No Co-Cult, and B, No Co-Cult) expressed low or undetectable levels of IL6, IL24, or CXCL10. After co-culture (Fig. 1A, Co-Cult) with NS/P cells, IL6, IL24, and CXCL10 in bEND cells were significantly increased. In contrast to contact co-culture (Fig. 1, A and B, Cont, Co-Cult), IL6, IL24, and CXCL10 in bEND cells co-cultured with NS/P cells in a Transwell (Fig. 1B, N-Cont, Co-Cult), a noncontact co-culture condition, were not induced. Brain endothelial cells cultured with the conditioned medium of NS/P cell culture did not exhibit increased expression of these genes either. 3H.-H. Tung and S.-L. Lee, unpublished observation. Fig. 1C shows that the secretion of IL6, IL24, and CXCL10 proteins after contact co-culture with NS/P cells (Fig. 1C, Cont, Co-Cult), but not in Transwell co-culture (Fig. 1C, No-Cont, Co-Cult), was three to four times greater than bEND cells without co-culture. Evidently, endothelial IL6, IL24, and CXCL10 induction occurs only in cells in direct contact with NS/P cells. The NS/P cells used in these cultures were differentiated from mouse embryonic stem cells. Identical results were observed in bEND cells in contact co-culture with NS/P cells isolated either from SVZ of the adult mouse brain LV (Fig. 1D, SVZ) or from neural cortex of 14-day mouse embryo (Fig. 1D, E14), clearly demonstrating that induction of endothelial cytokine/chemokine is a general feature of NS/P cells. These data demonstrate that endothelial expression of cytokines/chemokines is induced by cell contact between NS/P and bEND cells. Our data suggest that signaling between NS/P and bEND cells takes place during cell-cell contact interaction and results in induction of endothelial cytokine/chemokine expression. We investigated whether p38 MAPK or PKCα was activated in bEND cells by contact with NS/P cells. We found that p38 MAPK protein (Fig. 2A, p38) was expressed in both NS/P (Fig. 2A, NPC) and bEND cells (Fig. 2A, bEND). In NS/P cells, p38 MAPK was present in the active, phosphorylated state (Fig. 2A, *p38), and it was not altered by co-culture with bEND cells (Fig. 2A, *p38 in NPC under Co-Cult). p38 MAPK proteins in bEND cells, on the other hand, were not phosphorylated until after contact co-culture with NS/P cells (Fig. 2A, bEND, Co-Cult). PKCα was not detected in NS/P cells; nor was its expression induced by co-culture with bEND cells (Fig. 2A, PKC in NPC). PKCα was present in bEND cells, but it was in a phosphorylated state; neither its expression nor its phosphorylation was affected by co-culture with NS/P cells (Fig. 2A, *PKC in bEND). These observations show that endothelial p38 MAPK, not PKCα, is activated by NS/P cells during cell contact. Cell contact induction of endothelial p38 MAPK phosphorylation was checked by immunofluorescence cell staining. Fig. 2B shows that bEND cells in contact with GFP-positive NS/P cells (Fig. 2B, green fluorescence) were highly stained by antibody to the phosphorylated p38 MAPK (Fig. 2B, red fluorescence, arrowheads). Cells that are not in contact with NS/P cells, on the other hand, were either negative or weakly stained (Fig. 2B, arrows). Weak staining of anti-phosphorylated p38 MAPK was observed occasionally in bEND cells without co-culture (Fig. 2B, left panel in the box) or in bEND cells co-cultured with NS/P cell in Transwell (Fig. 2B, right panel in the box), suggesting basal staining of phosphorylate p38MAP in uninduced bEND cells. Same as that shown in Fig. 2A, p38 MAPK are phosphorylated in NS/P cells whether or not they were in contact with bEND cells (Fig. 2B co-stain of GFP and p38*). Cell staining further confirmed that p38 MAPK activation in bEND cells is promoted by contact with NS/P cells. To investigate whether p38 MAPK signaling is responsible for NS/P cell-induced endothelial IL6, IL24 or CXCL10 expression, co-cultured bEND-NS/P cells were treated with p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. In the presence of SB203580, NS/P cells failed to induce endothelial IL6 and CXCL10 expression, showing that induction of these endothelial molecules is mediated by p38 MAPK activation induced during co-culture. IL24 expression induced by NS/P cells, however, was not affected much by SB203580 (Fig. 2C, +p38I, Co-Cult), suggesting that p38 MAPK signaling is not the main responsive pathway for IL24 induction. These data demonstrate that NS/P cells in contact with bEND cells activate endothelial p38 MAPK, which can lead to overproduction of some (if not all) endothelial cytokines/chemokines. The observations described above suggested that cell to cell signaling systems exist at the cell contact interface between NS/P cells and bEND cells. We recently showed that the type II transmembrane serine protease matriptase (MTP) is expressed in NS/P cells (13Fang J.D. Chou H.C. Tung H.H. Huang P.Y. Lee S.L. Endogenous expression of matriptase in neural progenitor cells promotes cell migration and neuron differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 5667-5679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Considering its cell surface locality and its substrate diversity, MTP represents a candidate NS/P cell membrane activator protein for inducing endothelial p38 MAPK signaling and the subsequent cytokine/chemokine expression. We tested this possibility by investigating the effect of knocking down the MTP expression in NS/P cells. MTP is highly expressed in NS/P cells; only a small amount of expression was detected in bEND cells (Fig. 3A, No Co-Cult) (13Fang J.D. Chou H.C. Tung H.H. Huang P.Y. Lee S.L. Endogenous expression of matriptase in neural progenitor cells promotes cell migration and neuron differentiation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 5667-5679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Consistent with the results in Fig. 1, contact co-culture with NS/P cells induced endothelial IL6 mRNA expression (Fig. 3A, CT Co-Cult). Contact of NS/P cells and bEND cells did not change the expression of MTP in either cell type (Fig. 3A, CT Co-Cult). MTP mRNA expression in NS/P cells was reduced by specific siRNA (Fig. 3A, M-KD NPC), and it remained knocked down during the course of co-culture with bEND cells (Fig. 3A, KD Co-Cult). These MTP knockdown cells were unable to induce endothelial IL6 mRNA during contact co-culture (Fig. 3A, KD Co-Cult). The ability of NS/P cells to induce endothelial CXCL10 in contact was also impaired by MTP knockdown (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, although IL24 induction was not affected by p38 MAPK inhibitor (Fig. 2), it was impaired by MTP knockdown (Fig. 3B), suggesting that MTP can activate additional endothelial signaling pathways. Semiquantitative RT-PCR is shown in Fig. 3C. Exponential amplification for IL6, IL24, and CXCL10 in bEND cells without co-culture (Fig. 3C, No Co-Cult) or co-cultured with MTP knockdown NS/P cells (Fig. 3C, M-KD Co-Cult) occurred between PCR cycles 25–27. After co-culture with NS/P cells, however, expression of these three molecules reached plateau before or around PCR cycle number 26 (Fig. 3C, Ctrl Co-Cult), confirming that induction of these transcripts in bEND cells by the NS/P cells they directly contact to is dependent on MTP. At the protein level, secretion of all three proteins was induced three or four times after contact with NS/P cells (Fig. 3D, +CTRL NPC). Cells in contact with MTP knockdown NS/P cells (Fig. 3D, +M-KD NPC), on the other hand, expressed all three proteins approximately the same levels as that in cells without co-culture (Fig. 3D, No NPC). Consistent with their mRNA expression, induction of endothelial IL6, IL24, and CXCL10 proteins was lost in MTP knockdown NS/P cell. MTP knockdown NS/P cells also lost their ability to induce endothelial p38 MAPK activation in co-culture (Fig. 3E, +M-KD NPC). Transfection of the MTP expression plasmid into MTP knockdown NS/P cells (Fig. 3F, M-KD/pM) restored MTP expression (Fig. 3F, gel image). These cells regained their ability to induce endothelial IL6, IL24, and CXCL10 in contact co-culture (Fig. 3F, graph, M-KD/pM). These data confirmed that NS/P cells induction of endothelial IL6, IL24, and CXCL10 is a specific effect of MTP. Transfection of MTP expression vector into control NS/P cells induced approximately the same amount of IL6, IL24, or CXCL10 (Fig. 3F, graph, pM). It is obvious that NS/P cell induction of endothelial I"
https://openalex.org/W1980225372,"Previous animal studies have illustrated a modulatory effect of neonatal pain experience on subsequent pain-related behaviors. However, the relationship between chronic pain status in adulthood and future pain perception remains unclear.In the current study, we investigated the effects of inflammatory pain experience on subsequent formalin-evoked pain behaviors and fear conditioning induced by noxious stimulation in adult rats. Our results demonstrated an increase of the second but not the first phase of formalin-induced pain behaviors in animals with a history of inflammatory pain that have recovered. Similarly, rats with persistent pain experience displayed facilitated acquisition and prolonged retention of pain-related conditioning. These effects of prior pain experience on subsequent behavior were prevented by repeated morphine administration at an early stage of inflammatory pain.These results suggest that chronic pain diseases, if not properly and promptly treated, may have a long-lasting impact on processing and perception of environmental threats. This may increase the susceptibility of patients to subsequent pain-related disorders, even when chronic pain develops in adulthood. These data highlight the importance of treatment of chronic pain at an early stage."

https://openalex.org/W2144746256,"The impact of gene silencing on cellular phenotypes is difficult to establish due to the complexity of interactions in the associated biological processes and pathways. A recent genome-wide RNA knock-down study both identified and phenotypically characterized a set of important genes for the cell cycle in HeLa cells. Here, we combine a molecular interaction network analysis, based on physical and functional protein interactions, in conjunction with evolutionary information, to elucidate the common biological and topological properties of these key genes. Our results show that these genes tend to be conserved with their corresponding protein interactions across several species and are key constituents of the evolutionary conserved molecular interaction network. Moreover, a group of bistable network motifs is found to be conserved within this network, which are likely to influence the network stability and therefore the robustness of cellular functioning. They form a cluster, which displays functional homogeneity and is significantly enriched in genes phenotypically relevant for mitosis. Additional results reveal a relationship between specific cellular processes and the phenotypic outcomes induced by gene silencing. This study introduces new ideas regarding the relationship between genotype and phenotype in the context of the cell cycle. We show that the analysis of molecular interaction networks can result in the identification of genes relevant to cellular processes, which is a promising avenue for future research."
https://openalex.org/W1981653374,"The study of synthetic peptides corresponding to discrete regions of proteins has facilitated the understanding of protein structure-activity relationships. Short peptides can also be used as powerful therapeutic agents. However, in many instances, small peptides are prone to rapid degradation or aggregation and may lack the conformation required to mimic the functional motifs of the protein. For peptides to function as pharmacologically active agents, efficient production or expression, high solubility, and retention of biological activity through purification and storage steps are required. We report here the design, expression, and functional analysis of eight engineered GST proteins (denoted GSHKTs) in which peptides ranging in size from 8 to 16 amino acids and derived from human high molecular weight kininogen (HK) domain 5 were inserted into GST (between Gly-49 and Leu-50). Peptides derived from HK are known to inhibit cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis, and the biological activity of the HK peptides was dramatically (>50-fold) enhanced following insertion into GST. GSHKTs are soluble and easily purified from Escherichia coli by affinity chromatography. Functionally, these hybrid proteins cause inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation. Crystallographic analysis of GSHKT10 and GSHKT13 (harboring 10- and 13-residue HK peptides, respectively) showed that the overall GST structure was not perturbed. These results suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of short peptides can be enhanced by insertion into larger proteins that are easily expressed and purified and that GST may potentially be used as such a carrier."
