https://openalex.org/W2473235403,"Live imaging and single-cell analyses are used to show that decision-making by differentiating haematopoietic stem cells between the megakaryocytic–erythroid and granulocytic–monocytic lineages is not initiated by stochastic switching between the lineage-specific transcription factors PU.1 and GATA1, which challenges the previous model of early myeloid lineage choice. How lineage-inducing transcription factors promote cell fate in the haematopoietic lineage is debated. Population level analyses have uncovered the existence of positive feedback and mutual inhibition, which suggested that lineage choice is driven stochastically by fluctuating antagonistic transcription factors. Timm Schroeder and colleagues use live imaging and single-cell analyses to demonstrate that the decision made by haematopoietic stem cells to differentiate along the megakaryocytic–erythroid or granulocytic–monocytic lineage does not depend on such stochastic switching between lineage-specific transcription factors PU.1 and GATA1, a conclusion that challenges the previous model of early myeloid lineage choice. The mechanisms underlying haematopoietic lineage decisions remain disputed. Lineage-affiliated transcription factors1,2 with the capacity for lineage reprogramming3, positive auto-regulation4,5 and mutual inhibition6,7 have been described as being expressed in uncommitted cell populations8. This led to the assumption that lineage choice is cell-intrinsically initiated and determined by stochastic switches of randomly fluctuating cross-antagonistic transcription factors3. However, this hypothesis was developed on the basis of RNA expression data from snapshot and/or population-averaged analyses9,10,11,12. Alternative models of lineage choice therefore cannot be excluded. Here we use novel reporter mouse lines and live imaging for continuous single-cell long-term quantification of the transcription factors GATA1 and PU.1 (also known as SPI1). We analyse individual haematopoietic stem cells throughout differentiation into megakaryocytic–erythroid and granulocytic–monocytic lineages. The observed expression dynamics are incompatible with the assumption that stochastic switching between PU.1 and GATA1 precedes and initiates megakaryocytic–erythroid versus granulocytic–monocytic lineage decision-making. Rather, our findings suggest that these transcription factors are only executing and reinforcing lineage choice once made. These results challenge the current prevailing model of early myeloid lineage choice."
https://openalex.org/W2471902705,"A snow-line is the region of a protoplanetary disk at which a major volatile, such as water or carbon monoxide, reaches its condensation temperature. Snow-lines play a crucial role in disk evolution by promoting the rapid growth of ice-covered grains. Signatures of the carbon monoxide snow-line (at temperatures of around 20 kelvin) have recently been imaged in the disks surrounding the pre-main-sequence stars TW Hydra and HD163296, at distances of about 30 astronomical units (au) from the star. But the water snow-line of a protoplanetary disk (at temperatures of more than 100 kelvin) has not hitherto been seen, as it generally lies very close to the star (less than 5 au away for solar-type stars). Water-ice is important because it regulates the efficiency of dust and planetesimal coagulation, and the formation of comets, ice giants and the cores of gas giants. Here we report ALMA images at 0.03-arcsec resolution (12 au) of the protoplanetary disk around V883 Ori, a protostar of 1.3 solar masses that is undergoing an outburst in luminosity arising from a temporary increase in the accretion rate. We find an intensity break corresponding to an abrupt change in the optical depth at about 42 au, where the elevated disk temperature approaches the condensation point of water, from which we conclude that the outburst has moved the water snow-line. The spectral behaviour across the snow-line confirms recent model predictions: dust fragmentation and the inhibition of grain growth at higher temperatures results in soaring grain number densities and optical depths. As most planetary systems are expected to experience outbursts caused by accretion during their formation our results imply that highly dynamical water snow-lines must be considered when developing models of disk evolution and planet formation."

https://openalex.org/W2461349680,"Individuals receiving monthly benefits through the U.S. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) often fall short of food at the end of the month and some report feelings of hunger. To investigate this situation, we used time diaries from the 2006–08 American Time Use Survey and Eating & Health Module to identify the timing of days where respondents reported no eating occurrences. Analysis includes descriptive statistics, a logit model, and a simulated benefit month. We found that SNAP participants were increasingly more likely than nonparticipants to report a day with no eating occurrences over the benefit issuance cycle. This supports the view that there is a monthly cycle in food consumption associated with the SNAP monthly benefit issuance policy."
https://openalex.org/W2462293364,"Background An aberrant metabolic activity or a compositional alteration of the gut microbiota has been proposed as a factor that makes us more prone to disease. Therefore, we explored the effect of two dietary fibers (arabinogalactan and inulin) on the microbiota from lean and obese subjects during 72 h in vitro fermentation experiments using the validated TNO dynamic in vitro model of the proximal colon: TIM-2. Metabolically, arabinogalactan fermentation showed a higher production of propionate when compared to n-butyrate in the obese microbiota fermentations. In general, lean microbiota produced more n-butyrate from the fermentation of both substrates when compared to the obese microbiota. Furthermore, the obese microbiota extracted more energy from the fermentation of both fibers. Results Compositionally, bacteria belonging to Gemmiger, Dorea, Roseburia, Alistipes, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genera were found to be highly abundant or stimulated by the prebiotics in the lean microbiota suggesting a potential role in leanness. Furthermore, a significant correlation between known butyrogenic strains including B. adolescentis, an unclassified Bifidobacterium and F. prausnitzii with this metabolite in the fermentation of inulin in both microbiotas was found. Conclusions Although supplementary in vivo studies are needed, the current study provides more evidence for the consumption of specific ingredients with the aim of modulating the gut microbiota in the context of obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2467466851,"Exploration and exploitation are two essential components for any optimization algorithm. Much exploration leads to oscillation and premature convergence while too much exploitation slows down the optimization algorithm and the optimizer may be stuck in local minima. Therefore, balancing the rates of exploration and exploitation at the optimization lifetime is a challenge. This study evaluates the impact of using chaos-based control of exploration/exploitation rates against using the systematic native control. Three modern algorithms were used in the study namely grey wolf optimizer (GWO), antlion optimizer (ALO) and moth-flame optimizer (MFO) in the domain of machine learning for feature selection. Results on a set of standard machine learning data using a set of assessment indicators prove advance in optimization algorithm performance when using variational repeated periods of declined exploration rates over using systematically decreased exploration rates."

https://openalex.org/W2461638023,"Cumin is an annual, herbaceous, medicinal, aromatic, spice glycophyte that contains diverse applications as a food and flavoring additive, and therapeutic agents. An efficient, less time consuming, Agrobacterium-mediated, a tissue culture-independent in planta genetic transformation method was established for the first time using cumin seeds. The SbNHX1 gene, cloned from an extreme halophyte Salicornia brachiata was transformed in cumin using optimized in planta transformation method. The SbNHX1 gene encodes a vacuolar Na+/H+ antiporter and is involved in the compartmentalization of excess Na+ ions into the vacuole and maintenance of ion homeostasis Transgenic cumin plants were confirmed by PCR using gene (SbNHX1, uidA and hptII) specific primers. The single gene integration event and overexpression of the gene were confirmed by Southern hybridization and competitive RT-PCR, respectively. Transgenic lines L3 and L13 showed high expression of the SbNHX1 gene compared to L6 whereas moderate expression was detected in L5 and L10 transgenic lines. Transgenic lines (L3, L5, L10 and L13), overexpressing the SbNHX1 gene, showed higher photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll a, b and carotenoid), and lower electrolytic leakage, lipid peroxidation (MDA content) and proline content as compared to wild type plants under salinity stress. Though transgenic lines were also affected by salinity stress but performed better compared to WT plants. The ectopic expression of the SbNHX1 gene confirmed enhanced salinity stress tolerance in cumin as compared to wild type plants under stress condition. The present study is the first report of engineering salt tolerance in cumin, so far and the plant may be utilized for the cultivation in saline areas."
https://openalex.org/W2473710544,"Some researchers have raised concerns that pictorial health warning labels (HWLs) on cigarette packages may lead to message rejection and reduced effectiveness of HWL messages. This study aimed to determine how state reactance (i.e., negative affect due to perceived manipulation) in response to both pictorial and text-only HWLs is associated with other types of HWL responses and with subsequent cessation attempts.Survey data were collected every 4 months between September 2013 and 2014 from online panels of adult smokers in Australia, Canada, Mexico, and the US were analyzed. Participants with at least one wave of follow-up were included in the analysis (n = 4,072 smokers; 7,459 observations). Surveys assessed psychological and behavioral responses to HWLs (i.e., attention to HWLs, cognitive elaboration of risks due to HWLs, avoiding HWLs, and forgoing cigarettes because of HWLs) and cessation attempts. Participants then viewed specific HWLs from their countries and were queried about affective state reactance. Logistic and linear Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) models regressed each of the psychological and behavioral HWL responses on reactance, while controlling for socio-demographic and smoking-related variables. Logistic GEE models also regressed having attempted to quit by the subsequent survey on reactance, each of the psychological and behavioral HWL responses (analyzed separately), adjustment variables. Data from all countries were initially pooled, with interactions between country and reactance assessed; when interactions were statistically significant, country-stratified models were estimated.Interactions between country and reactance were found in all models that regressed psychological and behavioral HWL responses on study variables. In the US, stronger reactance was associated with more frequent reading of HWLs and thinking about health risks. Smokers from all four countries with stronger reactance reported greater likelihood of avoiding warnings and forgoing cigarettes due to warnings, although the association appeared stronger in the US. Both stronger HWLs responses and reactance were positively associated with subsequent cessation attempts, with no significant interaction between country and reactance.Reactance towards HWLs does not appear to interfere with quitting, which is consistent with its being an indicator of concern, not a systematic effort to avoid HWL message engagement."
https://openalex.org/W2464945919,"Late Cretaceous terrestrial strata of the Neuquén Basin, northern Patagonia, Argentina have yielded a rich fauna of dinosaurs and other vertebrates. The diversity of saurischian dinosaurs is particularly high, especially in the late Cenomanian-early Turonian Huincul Formation, which has yielded specimens of rebacchisaurid and titanosaurian sauropods, and abelisaurid and carcharodontosaurid theropods. Continued sampling is adding to the known vertebrate diversity of this unit.A new, partially articulated mid-sized theropod was found in rocks from the Huincul Formation. It exhibits a unique combination of traits that distinguish it from other known theropods justifying erection of a new taxon, Gualicho shinyae gen. et sp. nov. Gualicho possesses a didactyl manus with the third digit reduced to a metacarpal splint reminiscent of tyrannosaurids, but both phylogenetic and multivariate analyses indicate that didactyly is convergent in these groups. Derived characters of the scapula, femur, and fibula supports the new theropod as the sister taxon of the nearly coeval African theropod Deltadromeus and as a neovenatorid carcharodontosaurian. A number of these features are independently present in ceratosaurs, and Gualicho exhibits an unusual mosaic of ceratosaurian and tetanuran synapomorphies distributed throughout the skeleton.Gualicho shinyae gen. et sp. nov. increases the known theropod diversity of the Huincul Formation and also represents the first likely neovenatorid from this unit. It is the most basal tetatanuran to exhibit common patterns of digit III reduction that evolved independently in a number of other tetanuran lineages. A close relationship with Deltadromaeus from the Kem Kem beds of Niger adds to the already considerable biogeographic similarity between the Huincul Formation and coeval rock units in North Africa."
https://openalex.org/W2467234833,"Understanding population and individual-level behavioral responses of large carnivores to human disturbance is important for conserving top predators in fragmented landscapes. However, previous research has not investigated resource selection at predation sites of mountain lions in highly urbanized areas. We quantified selection of natural and anthropogenic landscape features by mountain lions at sites where they consumed their primary prey, mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), in and adjacent to urban, suburban, and rural areas in greater Los Angeles. We documented intersexual and individual-level variation in the environmental conditions present at mule deer feeding sites relative to their availability across home ranges. Males selected riparian woodlands and areas closer to water more than females, whereas females selected developed areas marginally more than males. Females fed on mule deer closer to developed areas and farther from riparian woodlands than expected based on the availability of these features across their home ranges. We suggest that mortality risk for females and their offspring associated with encounters with males may have influenced the different resource selection patterns between sexes. Males appeared to select mule deer feeding sites mainly in response to natural landscape features, while females may have made kills closer to developed areas in part because these are alternative sites where deer are abundant. Individual mountain lions of both sexes selected developed areas more strongly within home ranges where development occurred less frequently. Thus, areas near development may represent a trade-off for mountain lions such that they may benefit from foraging near development because of abundant prey, but as the landscape becomes highly urbanized these benefits may be outweighed by human disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W2464498066,"European beech forests growing on marginal calcareous soils have been proposed to be vulnerable to decreased soil water availability. This could result in a large-scale loss of ecological services and economical value in a changing climate. In order to evaluate the potential consequences of this drought-sensitivity, we investigated potential species range shifts for European beech forests on calcareous soil in the 21st century by statistical species range distribution modelling for present day and projected future climate conditions. We found a dramatic decline by 78% until 2080. Still the physiological or biogeochemical mechanisms underlying the drought sensitivity of European beech are largely unknown. Drought sensitivity of beech is commonly attributed to plant physiological constraints. Furthermore, it has also been proposed that reduced soil water availability could promote nitrogen (N) limitation of European beech due to impaired microbial N cycling in soil, but this hypothesis has not yet been tested. Hence we investigated the influence of simulated climate change (increased temperatures, reduced soil water availability) on soil gross microbial N turnover and plant N uptake in the beech-soil interface of a typical mountainous beech forest stocking on calcareous soil in SW Germany. For this purpose, triple 15N isotope labelling of intact beech seedling-soil-microbe systems was combined with a space-for-time climate change experiment. We found that nitrate was the dominant N source for beech natural regeneration. Reduced soil water content caused a persistent decline of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and therefore, a massive attenuation of gross nitrification rates and nitrate availability in the soil. Consequently, nitrate and total N uptake of beech seedlings were strongly reduced so that impaired growth of beech seedlings was observed already after one year of exposure to simulated climatic change. We conclude that the N cycle in this ecosystem and here specifically nitrification is vulnerable to reduced water availability, which can directly lead to nutritional limitations of beech seedlings. This tight link between reduced water availability, drought stress for nitrifiers, decreased gross nitrification rates and nitrate availability and finally nitrate uptake by beech seedlings could represent the Achilles’ heel for beech under climate change stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2464641366,"Induction of mucosal healing (MH) is an important treatment goal in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although the molecular mechanisms underlying MH in IBD is not fully explored, local fibrosis would contribute to interfere mucosal repair. Carbohydrate sulfotransferase 15 (CHST15), which catalyzes sulfation of chondroitin sulfate to produce rare E-disaccharide units, is a novel mediator to create local fibrosis. Here we have used siRNA-based approach of silencing CHST15 in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced colitis in mice, human colon fibroblasts and cancer cell lines. In a DSS-induced acute colitis model, CHST15 siRNA reduced CHST15 mRNA in the colon, serum IL-6, disease activity index (DAI) and accumulation of F4/80+ macrophages and ER-TR7+ fibroblasts, while increased Ki-67+ epithelial cells. In DSS-induced chronic colitis models, CHST15 siRNA reduced CHST15 mRNA in the colon, DAI, alpha-smooth muscle actin+ fibroblasts and collagen deposition, while enhanced MH as evidenced by reduced histological and endoscopic scores. We also found that endoscopic submucosal injection achieved effective pancolonic delivery of CHST15 siRNA in mice. In human CCD-18 Co cells, CHST15 siRNA inhibited the expression of CHST15 mRNA and selectively reduced E-units, a specific product biosynthesized by CHST15, in the culture supernatant. CHST15 siRNA significantly suppressed vimentin in both TGF-ß-stimulated CCD18-Co cells and HCT116 cells while up-regulated BMP7 and E-cadherin in HCT116 cells. The present study demonstrated that blockade CHST15 represses colonic fibrosis and enhances MH partly though reversing EMT pathway, illustrating a novel therapeutic opportunity to refractory and fibrotic lesions in IBD."
https://openalex.org/W2462800002,"Plakins are large multi-domain proteins that interconnect cytoskeletal structures. Plectin is a prototypical plakin that tethers intermediate filaments to membrane-associated complexes. Most plakins contain a plakin domain formed by up to nine spectrin repeats (SR1–SR9) and an SH3 domain. The plakin domains of plectin and other plakins harbor binding sites for junctional proteins. We have combined x-ray crystallography with small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) to elucidate the structure of the plakin domain of plectin, extending our previous analysis of the SR1 to SR5 region. Two crystal structures of the SR5-SR6 region allowed us to characterize its uniquely wide inter-repeat conformational variability. We also report the crystal structures of the SR7-SR8 region, refined to 1.8 Å, and the SR7–SR9 at lower resolution. The SR7–SR9 region, which is conserved in all other plakin domains, forms a rigid segment stabilized by uniquely extensive inter-repeat contacts mediated by unusually long helices in SR8 and SR9. Using SAXS we show that in solution the SR3–SR6 and SR7–SR9 regions are rod-like segments and that SR3–SR9 of plectin has an extended shape with a small central kink.

Plectin is expressed in a large variety of cell types in which it acts as a highly polyvalent cytolinker that contributes to cell adhesion and the organization of the cytoskeleton. Plectin cross-links IFs to microtubules and actin filaments and mediates the attachment of IFs to cell-cell and cell-matrix junctional complexes such as hemidesmosomes, desmosomes, Z-lines, and focal contacts. Plectin also connects IFs to organelles such as the nucleus and mitochondria (3Wiche G. Osmanagic-Myers S. Castañón M.J.

The plakin domain is present in all plakins except epiplakin. The pairwise sequence identity between the SR3–SR9 region of mammalian plakins ranges from ∼21 to 53%, although some proteins have shorter forms of the plakin domain. The epithelial isoform of BPAG1 (BPAG1e, also known as BP230) lacks the SR1, and the SR1-SR2 tandem is absent in desmoplakin, periplakin, and envoplakin. In desmoplakin the SR6 is connected to the SR7 by a uniquely long linker that is sensitive to proteases (21Al-Jassar C. Bernad P. Chidgey M. Overduin M. Hinged plakin domains provide specialized degrees of articulation in envoplakin, periplakin and desmoplakin.PloS One. 2013; 8: e69767Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similarly, in periplakin and envoplakin the SR6 is replaced by 15–20-residue-long sequences. Analysis of the plakin domains of desmoplakin, periplakin, and envoplakin in solution by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) has revealed various degrees of segmental flexibility caused by the unique SR6-SR7 or SR5–SR7 linkers (21Al-Jassar C. Bernad P. Chidgey M. Overduin M. Hinged plakin domains provide specialized degrees of articulation in envoplakin, periplakin and desmoplakin.PloS One. 2013; 8: e69767Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Despite recent advances in the characterization of plakin domains, no atomic structure of the SR7–SR9 region has been described to date. Similarly, the entire structure of plakin domains that lack long SR6-SR7 linkers, such as those of plectin, BPAG1, and MACF1, remains unknown. Here we have combined x-ray crystallography with SAXS to elucidate the structure of the plakin domain of plectin, which has an extended rod-like shape. In addition, a comparative analysis of the plakin domain of desmoplakin has revealed differences in the segmental flexibility of these two proteins. Our results have implications for the properties of plakins and their contribution to the stability and mechanobiology of tissues subjected to mechanical stress. To obtain a comprehensive description of the structure of the plakin domain of plectin, we produced recombinant multi-domain fragments that cover the SR3–SR9 region, and we combined detailed analysis of two- and three-repeat fragments by crystallography with information on the global structure of larger segments, including the complete SR3–SR9 region, obtained by SAXS. Previously, we elucidated the crystal structures of the SR3-SR4 and SR4-SR5-SH3 regions of plectin (15Ortega E. Buey R.M. Sonnenberg A. de Pereda J.M. The structure of the plakin domain of plectin reveals a non-canonical SH3 domain interacting with its fourth spectrin repeat.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 12429-12438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To complete the analysis of the SR3–SR6 region, we attempted unsuccessfully to crystallize the SR3–SR6 and SR4–SR6 fragments. Therefore, we focused on the SR5-SR6 region. Because the SH3 makes extensive contacts with the SR4, we created two SR5-SR6 constructs in which the SH3 domain was replaced by a five-residue (SR5-SR6-ΔSH3-A) or a three-residue (SR5-SR6-ΔSH3-B) sequence (Fig. 1A). Both proteins were crystallized, and their structures were refined against data to 2.8 and 3.0 Å, respectively. Each crystal form contains two SR5-SR6 molecules in the asymmetric unit (AU). The individual structures of the SR5 and SR6 domains are highly conserved in the four molecules. After pairwise superimposition of the four structures of the SR5 domain, the root mean square deviation (rmsd) for 99 Cα atoms ranged from 0.46 to 0.67 Å. Similarly, the four copies of SR6 were superposed with the rmsd for 77 Cα atoms between 0.44 and 0.65 Å. The SR5 exhibits a canonical SR fold, whereas the SR6 is smaller and has an additional short helix (B0) between helices A and B (Fig. 1B). These repeats of plectin are very similar to the equivalent domains in the crystal structure of the SR3–SR6 region of desmoplakin (16Choi H.J. Weis W.I. Crystal structure of a rigid four-spectrin-repeat fragment of the human desmoplakin plakin domain.J. Mol. Biol. 2011; 409: 800-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); individually the SR5 and SR6 domains of plectin and desmoplakin superimpose with a Cα rmsd of 1.07–1.24 Å and 0.97–1.20 Å, respectively. Thus, exchanging the SH3 domain by short Gly-Ser sequences does not disrupt the overall structure of the SR5 domain. Helix B0 of the SR6 is reminiscent of the short helix B0 of the SR5 observed in the structure of the SR4-SR5 region of plectin (15Ortega E. Buey R.M. Sonnenberg A. de Pereda J.M. The structure of the plakin domain of plectin reveals a non-canonical SH3 domain interacting with its fourth spectrin repeat.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 12429-12438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the structures of the SR5-SR6-ΔSH3 fragments, the helix SR5-B0 is rearranged, being part of helix B (Fig. 2). Analogously, the region of the SR6 around helix B0, which is predicted to be close to the SR7, might adopt a different conformation in the full-length protein. Similar helical rearrangements near the loops of SRs have been observed in spectrins (22Grum V.L. Li D. MacDonald R.I. Mondragón A. Structures of two repeats of spectrin suggest models of flexibility.Cell. 1999; 98: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In contrast to the structural conservation of individual domains, superposition of the SR5 repeats revealed differences in the position of the SR6 in the four molecules (Fig. 1C). These variations are due mainly to differences in the roll (−3.3° to −19.6°) and tilt (−16.5° to −23.3°) angles; hence, they correspond to changes in inter-repeat bending (supplemental Table S1). Our crystal structures represent snapshots of the inter-repeat conformational variability. Principal component (PC) analysis revealed that the four conformers of the SR5-SR6 region are related by two major perpendicular rigid-body oscillations of ∼13° and ∼5° amplitude, which correspond approximately to roll (PC1) and tilt (PC2) rotations (Fig. 1, D and E). In both movements the beginning of helix SR6-A acts as a hinge. The arrangement of the SR5-SR6 segment of plectin is very similar to that of desmoplakin. Yet, the conformational variations of this region are larger in plectin than in desmoplakin. The variability of the inter-repeat orientation is a major source of flexibility of SR arrays (22Grum V.L. Li D. MacDonald R.I. Mondragón A. Structures of two repeats of spectrin suggest models of flexibility.Cell. 1999; 98: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Bending oscillations also occur in other segments of the plakin domain (e.g. SR3-SR4), but those of the SR5-SR6 pair show the largest variations (supplemental Table S1). Notably, the conformational changes in the SR5-SR6 region of plectin are similar to those in the SR16-SR17 region of α-spectrin (22Grum V.L. Li D. MacDonald R.I. Mondragón A. Structures of two repeats of spectrin suggest models of flexibility.Cell. 1999; 98: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 23Kusunoki H. Minasov G. Macdonald R.I. Mondragón A. Independent movement, dimerization and stability of tandem repeats of chicken brain alpha-spectrin.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 495-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1F and supplemental Table S2). In summary, the SR5-SR6 region is a preferentially bendable site of the plakin domain. Finally, the SR6 region of one of the molecules in the AU of the SR5-SR6-ΔSH3-A crystals (protein chain B), which only makes crystal lattice contacts through the helix B0, has poorer electron density and higher average B-factors (134 Å2) than the other SRs in the crystal (59–103 Å2), suggesting that SR6 has an intrinsically relaxed structure. Collectively, our data support the assertion that SR6 is a region of substantial structural plasticity within the plakin domain. To elucidate the structure of the C-terminal segment of the plakin domain of plectin, initially we solved the crystal structure of the SR7-SR8 region to 1.80 Å resolution. The AU of the crystals contains two SR7-SR8 molecules. After superimposition of the individual repeats, the rmsd for the Cα atoms of SR7 and SR8 was 0.18 and 0.30 Å, respectively. A similar Cα rmsd of 0.32 Å was obtained when the full SR7-SR8 region was superimposed, revealing that the relative orientation of the two repeats is almost identical in the two monomers. SR7 and SR8 have a canonical SR fold (Fig. 3A), yet their B helices are longer than those in other repeats of the SR1–SR6 region of the plakin domain. Specifically, helix SR8-B is unusually long (∼46 residues) and extends at the C terminus about two more turns than helix SR7-B. The orientation of SR8 is related to SR7 by a ∼46 Å translation and a ∼54° rotation around the longitudinal axis of the molecule. Consequently, helices SR7-A and SR8-C are on the same side of the molecule. The inter-repeat linker formed by the fusion of helices SR7-C and SR8-A participates in the hydrophobic cores of both repeats. Helices SR7-B and SR8-B extend toward the adjacent repeat, creating two short segments of four-helix bundles (Fig. 3B). The SR7-SR8 arrangement is further stabilized by the interaction between the AB loop of SR7 and the BC loop of SR8. These loops are connected by a network of polar contacts that include interactions of the side chains of Glu-1200 and Arg-1203 with backbone atoms of the AB loop of SR7, a salt bridge between Arg-1035 and Glu-1196, and several hydrogen bonds mediated by water molecules partially buried between both loops. Collectively, our data indicates that the SR7-SR8 region is a rigid segment. Owing to the lateral inter-repeat contacts at the linker region, we refer to SR7 and SR8 as overlapping repeats. Crystals of the SR7–SR9 region of plectin produced highly anisotropic diffraction. Anisotropy arises from the alignment of the elongated SR7–SR9 molecules in the crystal lattice (Fig. 4). The AU contains two SR7–SR9 molecules that are very similar (Fig. 5A). After superimposition of the individual repeats, the rmsd for the Cα atoms were 0.20, 0.33, and 0.54 Å for SR7, SR8, and SR9, respectively. The interdomain arrangement is also identical in both molecules; the complete monomers superpose with an rmsd for 341 Cα atoms of 0.63 Å. In addition, the structure of the isolated SR7-SR8 region closely resembles that of the corresponding region of the SR7–SR9; after superimposition the rmsd of the common Cα between SR7-SR8 and SR7–SR9 range between 0.77 and 0.86 Å.FIGURE 5Crystal structure of SR7–SR9 of plectin.

SR9 has a very long helix B (∼54 residues) that has two turns more at the C terminus than helix SR8-B. The final part of helix SR9-B contacts SR8 forming a four-helix bundle (Fig. 5C and Fig. 6). Residues Tyr-1309, Leu-1313, and Tyr-1316, which occupy positions d, a, and d of the heptad motif of helix SR9-B, face the groove formed by helices A and C and loop AB of SR8. The SR8 structure can be superimposed on that of SR9 by applying a ∼51 Å translation and a ∼69° rotation around the longitudinal axis of the molecule, which is similar to the relative arrangement of the SR7-SR8 pair (see above). Owing to the conserved inter-repeat rotation in the SR7–SR9 region, helices A–C and the unusually long B helices of SR8 and SR9 form a left-handed pseudo superhelix that resembles a twisted rope (Fig. 5D). Moreover, helix SR7-A is aligned with helix SR8-C/SR9-A forming a discontinuous thread of the superhelix that spans the full length of the molecule. Similarly, helix SR7-B is aligned with helix SR9-B, and helix SR7-C/SR8-A is aligned with helix SR9-C. Therefore, the superhelical architecture of the SR7–SR9 region consists of four antiparallel threads. In summary, the overlapping repeats of the SR7–SR9 region form a rigid structure stabilized by long helices and extensive inter-repeat contacts. We analyzed whether the SR7–SR9 region was also present in other plakins. Searching the human proteome with a profile hidden Markov model (HMM) built from the sequence of the SR7–SR9 region of plectin revealed the presence of homologous regions of similar extension in BPAG1, MACF1, and desmoplakin (Table 1). Because this initial search did not reveal similar regions in other plakins, we performed a new search using a profile HMM built from the SR7–SR9 sequences of plectin, BPAG1, MACF1 and desmoplakin, which unveiled the presence of an SR7–SR9 region in envoplakin and periplakin.TABLE 1Identification of SR7-SR9 segments in plakinsProteinOrganismE-valueRegionRepeatsSR7SR8SR9Plectin (Q15149–2)H. sapiensNA1004–13721004–11161117–12341234–1372BPAG1 (Q03001–3)H. sapiens8.1e-81734–1103734–846847–964965–1103MACF1 (Q9UPN3–2)H. sapiens2.7e-711041–14141041–11571158–12751276–1414Desmoplakin (P15924)H. sapiens1.4e-48660–1025660–768769–886887–1025Envoplakin (Q92817)H. sapiens3.3e-31520–889519–632633–750751–889Periplakin (O60437)H. sapiens7.2e-30500–870499–612613–730731–871VAB-10 (G5EDD3)C. elegans1.8e-16986–1345981–10861087–12151216–1360Shot (A1Z9J3)D. melanogaster1.7e-081039–12951039–11441145–12571258–1394 Open table in a new tab Next, we used a profile HMM built from the SR7–SR9 sequences of the six human plakins to analyze the presence of homologous regions in plakins of invertebrates. We identified a single SR7–SR9-like region in VAB-10 and Shot, the only plakins found in C. elegans and D. melanogaster, respectively. The region of Shot identified in the search (residues 1039–1295) included SR7-SR8 but only part of SR9, yet two predicted α-helices completed the SR9 region (residues 1258–1394), which is similar in length to other plakins. A multiple sequence alignment of the SR7–SR9 sequences of human plakins, VAB-10, and Shot is shown in Fig. 7. In all of the searches, a single SR7–SR9 region was identified in the C-terminal part of the plakin domain of each protein, and no homologous regions were detected in other proteins. Thus, our profile-based search was specific for the SR7–SR9 signature. In summary, the SR7–SR9 region is present in all plakins that contain a plakin domain, and this region is distinct from other tandem arrays of SRs. To elucidate the structure of the plakin domain of plectin in solution we analyzed the SR3–SR9 segment and its two constituent moieties, SR3–SR6 and SR7–SR9, by SAXS (Fig. 8 and Table 2). The samples were monodisperse and monomeric, as suggested by the linearity of the Guinier plots of the scattering data (Fig. 8B) and the molecular masses estimated from the scattering data. The Guinier radii of gyration (Rg) of each protein remained constant within the experimental errors in the range of concentrations measured, indicating minimal contribution of interparticle effects. The pair-distance distribution functions, P(r), calculated from the scattering data had maxima at short interatomic distances and long tails extending to maximum distances (Dmax) of about 210, 170, and 350 Å for the SR3–SR6, SR7–SR9, and SR3–SR9 regions, respectively (Fig. 8C).

https://openalex.org/W2463413529,"SWEETs represent a new class of sugar transporters first described in plants, animals, and humans and later in prokaryotes. Plant SWEETs play key roles in phloem loading, seed filling, and nectar secretion, whereas the role of archaeal, bacterial, and animal transporters remains elusive. Structural analyses show that eukaryotic SWEETs are composed of 2 triple-helix bundles (THBs) fused via an inversion linker helix, whereas prokaryotic SemiSWEETs contain only a single THB and require homodimerization to form transport pores. This study indicates that SWEETs retained sugar transport activity in all kingdoms of life, and that SemiSWEETs are likely their ancestral units. Fusion of oligomeric subunits into single polypeptides during evolution of eukaryotes is commonly found for transporters. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that THBs of eukaryotic SWEETs may not have evolved by tandem duplication of an open reading frame, but rather originated by fusion between an archaeal and a bacterial SemiSWEET, which potentially explains the asymmetry of eukaryotic SWEETs. Moreover, despite the ancient ancestry, SWEETs had not been identified in fungi or oomycetes. Here, we report the identification of SWEETs in oomycetes as well as SWEETs and a potential SemiSWEET in primitive fungi.

https://openalex.org/W2466478153,"A three-dimensional Regional Ocean Modeling System is used to study the seasonal water circulations and transports of the Southern South China Sea. The simulated seasonal water circulations and estimated transports show consistency with observations, e.g., satellite altimeter data set and re-analysis data of the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation. It is found that the seasonal water circulations are mainly driven by the monsoonal wind stress and influenced by the water outflow/inflow and associated currents of the entire South China Sea. The intrusion of the strong current along the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia and the eddies at different depths in all seasons are due to the conservation of the potential vorticity as the depth increases. Results show that the water circulation patterns in the northern part of the East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia are generally dominated by the geostrophic currents while those in the southern areas are due solely to the wind stress because of negligible Coriolis force there. This study clearly shows that individual surface freshwater flux (evaporation minus precipitation) controls the sea salinity balance in the Southern South China Sea thermohaline circulations. Analysis of climatological data from a high resolution Regional Ocean Modeling System reveals that the complex bathymetry is important not only for water exchange through the Southern South China Sea but also in regulating various transports across the main passages in the Southern South China Sea, namely the Sunda Shelf and the Strait of Malacca. Apart from the above, in comparision with the dynamics of the Sunda Shelf, the Strait of Malacca reflects an equally significant role in the annual transports into the Andaman Sea."

https://openalex.org/W2467566459,"Polymersomes are being widely explored as synthetic analogs of lipid vesicles based on their enhanced stability and potential uses in a wide variety of applications in (e.g., drug delivery, cell analogs, etc.). Controlled formation of giant polymersomes for use in membrane studies and cell mimetic systems, however, is currently limited by low-yield production methodologies. Here, we describe for the first time, how the size distribution of giant poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(butadiene) (PEO-PBD) polymersomes formed by gel-assisted rehydration may be controlled based on membrane fluidization. We first show that the average diameter and size distribution of PEO-PBD polymersomes may be readily increased by increasing the temperature of the rehydration solution. Further, we describe a correlative relationship between polymersome size and membrane fluidization through the addition of sucrose during rehydration, enabling the formation of PEO-PBD polymersomes with a range of diameters, including giant-sized vesicles (>100 μm). This correlative relationship suggests that sucrose may function as a small molecule fluidizer during rehydration, enhancing polymer diffusivity during formation and increasing polymersome size. Overall the ability to easily regulate the size of PEO-PBD polymersomes based on membrane fluidity, either through temperature or fluidizers, has broadly applicability in areas including targeted therapeutic delivery and synthetic biology."

Ab initio modeling of hnRNPA1 was made using Rosetta and refined using KoBaMIN. The structure was validated by PROCHECK, Rampage, ERRAT, Verify3D, ProSA and Qmean. TM-align was used for the structural alignment. FoldIndex, DICHOT, ELM, D2P2, Disopred and DisEMBL were used to predict disordered regions within the protein. Amino acid conservation analysis was assessed by Consurf, and the molecular dynamics simulations were performed using GROMACS. Mutations D314V and D314N were predicted to increase amyloid propensity, and predicted as deleterious by at least three algorithms, while mutation N73S was predicted as neutral by all the algorithms. D314N and D314V occur in a highly conserved amino acid. The Molecular Dynamics results indicate that all mutations increase protein stability when compared to the wild type. Mutants D314N and N319S showed higher overall dimensions and accessible surface when compared to the wild type.

Evidence continues to mount that life expectancy (LE) increases with successful treatment of hepatitis C (HCV) patients with advanced fibrosis. The evidence in older people is more limited. Our aim was to estimate the life year (LY) and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained by treatment of naïve patients with HCV as a function of patient's age and fibrosis stage.We constructed a Markov model of HCV progression toward advanced liver disease. The primary outcome was LY and QALY saved. The model and the sustained virological response of HCV infected subjects treated with a fixed-dose combination of the NS5B polymerase inhibitor Sofosbuvir and the NS5A replication complex inhibitor Ledipasvir were based on the published literature and expert opinion.Generally, both the number of LY gained and QALY gained gradually decreased with advancing age but the rate of decline was slower with more advanced fibrosis stage. For patients with fibrosis stage F1, F2 and F3, LY gained dropped below six months if treated by the age of 55, 65 or 70 years, respectively, while for a patient with fibrosis stage F4, the gain was one LY if treated by the age of 75. The QALY gained for treated over untreated elderly were reasonably high even for those treated at early fibrosis stage.There is a significant life expectancy benefit to HCV treatment in patients up to age 75 with advanced-stage fibrosis."

The cases were children hospitalized for severe diarrhea and the controls were children without diarrhea selected at random from the community. Stool samples were collected from both groups. Anthropometric measurements were made during follow-up visits about one and two months after enrolment.We enrolled 199 cases and 199 controls. Rotavirus infection was the most frequently detected cause of diarrhea. It was strongly associated with severe diarrhea (OR: 58.3; 95% CI: 7.7-439.9), accounting for 42.4% (95% CI: 37.6-43.1) of severe diarrhea cases. At the household level, possession of cattle (OR = 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1-0.6) and living in a house with electricity (OR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2-0.8) were protective factors. The presence of garbage around the house was a risk factor for severe diarrhea (OR = 3.2; 95% CI: 1.9-5.4). We found no significant association between severe diarrhea and the nutritional status of the children at follow-up visits, but evident wasting at enrolment was associated with a higher risk of severe diarrhea (OR = 9; 95% CI: 4.5-17.9).Severe childhood diarrhea is mostly caused by rotavirus infection.

First responders to oil spills along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico in the southern United States have used spunbond nylon fabric bags and fences to separate spilled oil and oil waste from contaminated water. Low area mass density spunbond nylon is capable of sorbing more than 16 times its mass in low viscosity crude oil and more than 26 times its mass in higher viscosity gear lube oil. Nylon bags separated more than 95% of gear lube oil contaminate from a 4.5% oil-in-water emulsion. Field testing of spunbond nylon fences by oil spill first responders has demonstrated the ability of this material to contain the oily contaminate while allowing water to flow through. We hypothesize that the effectiveness of nylon as an oil filter is due to the fact that it is both more oleophilic and more hydrophilic than other commonly used oil separation materials. The nylon traps oil droplets within the fabric or on the surface, while water droplets are free to flow through the fabric to the water on the opposite side of the fabric."

Thorough literature review allowed us to extract 125 ICD-9 codes comorbid to ASD that we mapped to 30 specific human disorders. In the present work, we performed an automated extraction of genes associated with ASD and its comorbid disorders, and found 1031 genes involved in ASD, among which 262 are involved in ASD only, with the remaining 779 involved in ASD and at least one comorbid disorder. A pathway analysis revealed 13 pathways not involved in any other comorbid disorders and therefore unique to ASD, all associated with basal cellular functions. These pathways differ from the pathways associated with both ASD and its comorbid conditions, with the latter being more specific to neural function. To determine whether the sequence of these genes have been subjected to differential evolutionary constraints, we studied long term constraints by looking into Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling, and showed that genes involved in several comorbid disorders seem to have undergone more purifying selection than the genes involved in ASD only. This result was corroborated by a higher dN/dS ratio for genes unique to ASD as compare to those that are shared between ASD and its comorbid disorders. Short-term evolutionary constraints showed the same trend as the pN/pS ratio indicates that genes unique to ASD were under significantly less evolutionary constraint than the genes associated with all other disorders."

Complete extinctions of regional species pools are comparatively rare whereas compositional changes and reductions in abundance and biomass are common, although seldom the focus of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning studies. We use natural, small-scale patchiness in the density of two species of large bivalves with contrasting feeding modes (the suspension-feeding Austrovenus stutchburyi and deposit-feeding Macomona liliana) to examine their influence on the uptake of nitrogen from macroalgae detritus (i.e. measure of ecosystem function and food web efficiency) by other infauna in a 10-d laboratory isotope-tracer experiment. We predicted that densities of these key bivalve species and functional group diversity (calculated as Shannons H, a density-independent measure of community composition) of the intact infaunal community will be critical factors explaining variance in macroalgal per capita uptake rates by the community members and hence determine total uptake by the community. Results show that only two species, M. liliana and a large orbiniid polychaete (Scoloplos cylindrifer) dominated macroalgal nitrogen taken up by the whole community due to their large biomass. However, their densities were mostly not important or negatively influenced per capita uptake by other species. Instead, the density of a head-down deposit-feeder (the capitellid Heteromastus filiformis), scavengers (mainly nemertines and nereids) and species and functional group diversity, best explained per capita uptake rates in community members. Our results demonstrate the importance of species identity, density and large body size for ecosystem functioning and highlight the complex interactions underlying loss of ecological functions with declining biodiversity and compositional changes."

https://openalex.org/W2472644326,"Calreticulin is a lectin chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum that interacts with newly synthesized glycoproteins by binding to Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides as well as to the polypeptide chain. In vitro, the latter interaction potently suppresses the aggregation of various non-glycosylated proteins. Although the lectin-oligosaccharide association is well understood, the polypeptide-based interaction is more controversial because the binding site on calreticulin has not been identified, and its significance in the biogenesis of glycoproteins in cells remains unknown. In this study, we identified the polypeptide binding site responsible for the in vitro aggregation suppression function by mutating four candidate hydrophobic surface patches. Mutations in only one patch, P19K/I21E and Y22K/F84E, impaired the ability of calreticulin to suppress the thermally induced aggregation of non-glycosylated firefly luciferase. These mutants also failed to bind several hydrophobic peptides that act as substrate mimetics and compete in the luciferase aggregation suppression assay. To assess the relative contributions of the glycan-dependent and -independent interactions in living cells, we expressed lectin-deficient, polypeptide binding-deficient, and doubly deficient calreticulin constructs in calreticulin-negative cells and monitored the effects on the biogenesis of MHC class I molecules, the solubility of mutant forms of α1-antitrypsin, and interactions with newly synthesized glycoproteins. In all cases, we observed a profound impairment in calreticulin function when its lectin site was inactivated. Remarkably, inactivation of the polypeptide binding site had little impact. These findings indicate that the lectin-based mode of client interaction is the predominant contributor to the chaperone functions of calreticulin within the endoplasmic reticulum."

To develop more compact microreactors for radiosynthesis of 18F-labeled compounds required for the multistep procedure, we attempted radiosynthesis of N-succinimidyl 4-[18F]fluorobenzoate ([18F]SFB) via a three-step procedure using a microreactor. We examined individual steps for [18F]SFB using a batch reactor and microreactor and developed a new continuous-flow synthetic method with a single microfluidic chip to achieve rapid and efficient radiosynthesis of [18F]SFB. In the synthesis of [18F]SFB using this continuous-flow method, the three-step reaction was successfully completed within 6.5 min and the radiochemical yield was 64 ± 2% (n = 5). In addition, it was shown that the quality of [18F]SFB synthesized on this method was equal to that synthesized by conventional methods using a batch reactor in the radiolabeling of bovine serum albumin with [18F]SFB."

However, the significance of the BRAF mRNA level in PTC remains unknown. We evaluated the significance of BRAF mRNA expression level by analyzing PTC data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Methods Data from 499 patients were downloaded from the TCGA database. After excluding other PTC variants, we selected 353 cases of classic PTC, including 193 cases with BRAFV600E and 160 cases with the wild-type BRAF. mRNA abundances were measured using RNA-Seq with the Expectation Maximization algorithm. Results The mean BRAF mRNA level was significantly higher in BRAFV600E patients than in patients with wild-type BRAF (197.6 vs. 179.3, p = 0.031). In wild-type BRAF patients, the mean BRAF mRNA level was higher in cases with a tumor > 2 cm than those with a tumor ≤ 2.0 cm (189.4 vs. 163.8, p = 0.046), and was also higher in cases with lymph node metastasis than in those without lymph node metastasis (188.5 vs. 157.9, p = 0.040). Within BRAFV600E patients, higher BRAF mRNA expression was associated with extrathyroidal extension (186.4 vs. 216.4, p = 0.001) and higher T stage (188.1 vs. 210.2, p = 0.016). Conclusions A higher BRAF mRNA expression level was associated with tumor aggressiveness in classic PTC regardless of BRAF mutational status. Evaluation of BRAF mRNA level may be helpful in prognostic risk stratification of PTC."

The main outcome measure was the difference in the prevalence of sight threatening DR [here defined as diabetic macular edema (DME) and/or proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR)], between the SCT and control groups. Secondary outcome measures included differences in visual acuity, ocular comorbidities, intraocular pressure, glycemic control as assessed by random blood glucose measurement, diabetes duration, nephropathy, hyperlipidemia and hypertension.The SCT group had statistically significantly shorter duration of DM (median [25% quartile] 15 [8.3] years versus 20 [14.7] years, respectively)(P<0.001) and presented with statistically better metabolic control (mean difference 1.6 mmol/l, (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.1-3.3;P = 0.03). The prevalence of PDR and/or DME was significantly lower in the SCT group (58%) compared to the control group, (95%)(P<0.001). The absence of SCT (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 24; 95% CI, 8-72; P<0.001) and longer duration of DM (AOR = 1.1 [95% CI, 1.02-1.13]; P = 0.003) were independent predictors of PDR and/or DME.SCT seems to protect against the development and progression of DR. This may have implications for monitoring and screening. Prospective studies are required to confirm this association. If true, this association may indicate an increased blood glucose buffering capacity of abnormal hemoglobin."

https://openalex.org/W2466412684,"For identifying the genes that are regulated by a transcription factor (TF), we have established an analytical pipeline that combines genomic systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (gSELEX)-Seq and RNA-Seq. Here, SELEX was used to select DNA fragments from an Aspergillus nidulans genomic library that bound specifically to AmyR, a TF from A. nidulans. High-throughput sequencing data were obtained for the DNAs enriched through the selection, following which various in silico analyses were performed. Mapping reads to the genome revealed the binding motifs including the canonical AmyR-binding motif, CGGN8CGG, as well as the candidate promoters controlled by AmyR. In parallel, differentially expressed genes related to AmyR were identified by using RNA-Seq analysis with samples from A. nidulans WT and amyR deletant. By obtaining the intersecting set of genes detected using both gSELEX-Seq and RNA-Seq, the genes directly regulated by AmyR in A. nidulans can be identified with high reliability. This analytical pipeline is a robust platform for comprehensive genome-wide identification of the genes that are regulated by a target TF."
https://openalex.org/W2461149604,"Diagnostic errors can occur, in infectious diseases, when anti-microbial immune responses involve several temporal scales. When responses span from nanosecond to week and larger temporal scales, any pre-selected temporal scale is likely to miss some (faster or slower) responses. Hoping to prevent diagnostic errors, a pilot study was conducted to evaluate a four-dimensional (4D) method that captures the complexity and dynamics of infectious diseases.Leukocyte-microbial-temporal data were explored in canine and human (bacterial and/or viral) infections, with: (i) a non-structured approach, which measures leukocytes or microbes in isolation; and (ii) a structured method that assesses numerous combinations of interacting variables. Four alternatives of the structured method were tested: (i) a noise-reduction oriented version, which generates a single (one data point-wide) line of observations; (ii) a version that measures complex, three-dimensional (3D) data interactions; (iii) a non-numerical version that displays temporal data directionality (arrows that connect pairs of consecutive observations); and (iv) a full 4D (single line-, complexity-, directionality-based) version.In all studies, the non-structured approach revealed non-interpretable (ambiguous) data: observations numerically similar expressed different biological conditions, such as recovery and lack of recovery from infections. Ambiguity was also found when the data were structured as single lines. In contrast, two or more data subsets were distinguished and ambiguity was avoided when the data were structured as complex, 3D, single lines and, in addition, temporal data directionality was determined. The 4D method detected, even within one day, changes in immune profiles that occurred after antibiotics were prescribed.Infectious disease data may be ambiguous. Four-dimensional methods may prevent ambiguity, providing earlier, in vivo, dynamic, complex, and personalized information that facilitates both diagnostics and selection or evaluation of anti-microbial therapies."

https://openalex.org/W2469686116,"Numerous broadly neutralizing antibodies (Abs) target epitopes that are formed or enhanced during mature HIV envelope formation (i.e. quaternary epitopes). Generally, it is thought that Env epitopes that induce broadly neutralizing Abs are difficult to access and poorly immunogenic because of the characteristic oligomerization, conformational flexibility, sequence diversity and extensive glycosylation of Env protein. To enhance for isolation of quaternary epitope-targeting Abs (QtAbs), we previously used HIV virus-like particles (VLPs) to bind B cells from long-term non-progressor subjects to identify a panel of monoclonal Abs. When expressed as recombinant full-length Abs, a subset of these novel Abs exhibited the binding profiles of QtAbs, as they either failed to bind to monomeric Env protein or showed much higher affinity for Env trimers and VLPs. These QtAbs represented a significant proportion of the B-cell response identified with VLPs. The Ab genes of these clones were highly mutated, but they did not neutralize common HIV strains. We sought to further define the epitopes targeted by these QtAbs. Competition-binding and mapping studies revealed these Abs targeted four separate epitopes; they also failed to compete for binding by Abs to known major neutralizing epitopes. Detailed epitope mapping studies revealed that two of the four epitopes were located in the gp41 subunit of Env. These QtAbs bound pre-fusion forms of antigen and showed differential binding kinetics depending on whether oligomers were produced as recombinant gp140 trimers or as full-length Env incorporated into VLPs. Antigenic regions within gp41 present unexpectedly diverse structural epitopes, including these QtAb epitopes, which may be targeted by the naturally occurring Ab response to HIV infection."

H3N8 CIV mainly circulates in America, and H3N2 CIV mainly circulates in Asia. However, there was an outbreak of the Asian H3N2 virus in the United States (US) in 2015. Thus, it is important to evaluate the presence of subtype H3N8 virus in dogs in China. From May 2015 to November 2015, 600 sera from pet dogs were collected from Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing and Shenzhen for hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assays and microneutralization (MN) assays. Fifty-two (8.66%) of the 600 sera were positive for the subtype H3N2 virus, which matched the previous reports. Five (0.83%) of 600 sera were positive for the subtype H3N8 virus (H3N8 EIV or H3N8 AIV or H3N8 CIV), which is the first report of subtype H3N8 virus infection among dogs in China and remind us to play more attention to this subtype virus. Therefore, further serological and virological surveillance of influenza virus infection among dogs in China is imperative."
https://openalex.org/W2474978975,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a molecular energy sensor that acts to sustain cellular energy balance. Although AMPK is implicated in the regulation of a multitude of ATP-dependent cellular processes, exactly how these processes are controlled by AMPK as well as the identity of AMPK targets and pathways continues to evolve. Here we identify MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 1a (MNK1a) as a novel AMPK target. Specifically, we show AMPK-dependent Ser(353) phosphorylation of the human MNK1a isoform in cell-free and cellular systems. We show that AMPK and MNK1a physically interact and that in vivo MNK1a-Ser(353) phosphorylation requires T-loop phosphorylation, in good agreement with a recently proposed structural regulatory model of MNK1a. Our data suggest a physiological role for MNK1a-Ser(353) phosphorylation in regulation of the MNK1a kinase, which correlates with increased eIF4E phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2460980084,"Hyperplastic candidiasis is characterized by thickening of the mucosal epithelia with Candida albicans infection with occasional progression to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). C. albicans is a critical factor in tumor development; however, the oncogenic mechanism is unclear. We have previously produced an animal model for hyperplastic candidiasis in the rat forestomach. In the present study, we investigate whether impaired DNA methylation and associated protein expression of tumor suppressor and DNA repair genes are involved in the SCC carcinogenesis process using this hyperplastic candidiasis model. Promoter methylation and protein expression were analyzed by methylation specific PCR and immunohistochemical staining, respectively, of 5 areas in the forestomachs of alloxan-induced diabetic rats with hyperplastic candidiasis: normal squamous epithelia, squamous hyperplasia, squamous hyperplasia adjacent to SCC, squamous hyperplasia transitioning to SCC, and SCC. We observed nuclear p16 overexpression despite increases in p16 gene promoter methylation during the carcinogenic process. TIMP3 and RAR-β2 promoter methylation progressed until the precancerous stage but disappeared upon malignant transformation. In comparison, TIMP3 protein expression was suppressed during carcinogenesis and RAR-β2 expression was attenuated in the cytoplasm but enhanced in nuclei. ERCC1 and BRCA1 promoters were not methylated at any stage; however, their protein expression disappeared beginning at hyperplasia and nuclear protein re-expression in SCC was observed only for ERCC1. These results suggest that aberrant p16, RAR-β2, TIMP3, ERCC1, and BRCA1 expression might occur that is inconsistent with the respective gene promoter methylation status, and that this overexpression might serve to promote the inflammatory carcinogenesis caused by C. albicans infection."

https://openalex.org/W2468457913,"In blind individuals, visually deprived occipital areas are activated by non-visual stimuli. The extent of this cross-modal activation depends on the age at onset of blindness. Cross-modal inputs have access to several anatomical pathways to reactivate deprived visual areas. Ectopic cross-modal subcortical connections have been shown in anophthalmic animals but not in animals deprived of sight at a later age. Direct and indirect cross-modal cortical connections toward visual areas could also be involved, yet the number of neurons implicated is similar between blind mice and sighted controls. Changes at the axon terminal, dendritic spine or synaptic level are therefore expected upon loss of visual inputs. Here, the proteome of V1, V2M and V2L from P0-enucleated, anophthalmic and sighted mice, sharing a common genetic background (C57BL/6J x ZRDCT/An), was investigated by 2-D DIGE and Western analyses to identify molecular adaptations to enucleation and/or anophthalmia. Few proteins were differentially expressed in enucleated or anophthalmic mice in comparison to sighted mice. The loss of sight affected three pathways: metabolism, synaptic transmission and morphogenesis. Most changes were detected in V1, followed by V2M. Overall, cross-modal adaptations could be promoted in both models of early blindness but not through the exact same molecular strategy. A lower metabolic activity observed in visual areas of blind mice suggests that even if cross-modal inputs reactivate visual areas, they could remain suboptimally processed."
