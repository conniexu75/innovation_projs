https://openalex.org/W1999689183,"The brain circuitry processing rewarding and aversive stimuli is hypothesized to be at the core of motivated behavior. In this study, discrete categories of beautiful faces are shown to have differing reward values and to differentially activate reward circuitry in human subjects. In particular, young heterosexual males rate pictures of beautiful males and females as attractive, but exert effort via a keypress procedure only to view pictures of attractive females. Functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T shows that passive viewing of beautiful female faces activates reward circuitry, in particular the nucleus accumbens. An extended set of subcortical and paralimbic reward regions also appear to follow aspects of the keypress rather than the rating procedures, suggesting that reward circuitry function does not include aesthetic assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2065384834,"We tested the hypothesis that amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its relatives function as vesicular receptor proteins for kinesin-I. Deletion of the Drosophila APP-like gene (Appl) or overexpression of human APP695 or APPL constructs caused axonal transport phenotypes similar to kinesin and dynein mutants. Genetic reduction of kinesin-I expression enhanced while genetic reduction of dynein expression suppressed these phenotypes. Deletion of the C terminus of APP695 or APPL, including the kinesin binding region, disrupted axonal transport of APP695 and APPL and abolished the organelle accumulation phenotype. Neuronal apoptosis was induced only by overexpression of constructs containing both the C-terminal and Abeta regions of APP695. We discuss the possibility that axonal transport disruption may play a role in the neurodegenerative pathology of Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W1987048771,"Mutations in dpix were recovered from a large-scale screen in Drosophila for genes that control synaptic structure. dpix encodes dPix, a Rho-type guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RtGEF) homologous to mammalian Pix. Here we show that dPix plays a major role in regulating postsynaptic structure and protein localization at the Drosophila glutamatergic neuromuscular junction. dpix mutations lead to decreased synaptic levels of the PDZ protein Dlg, the cell adhesion molecule Fas II, and the glutamate receptor subunit GluRIIA, and to a complete reduction of the serine/threonine kinase Pak and the subsynaptic reticulum. The electrophysiology of these mutant synapses is nearly normal. Many, but not all, dpix defects are mediated through dPak, a member of the family of Cdc42/Rac1-activated kinases. Thus, a Rho-type GEF and Rho-type effector kinase regulate postsynaptic structure."
https://openalex.org/W2041746311,"This study explores the nature of population coding in sensory cortex by applying information theoretic analyses to neuron pairs recorded simultaneously from rat barrel cortex. We quantified the roles of individual spikes and spike patterns in encoding whisker stimulus location. 82%–85% of the total information was contained in the timing of individual spikes: first spike time was particularly crucial. Spike patterns within neurons accounted for the remaining 15%–18%. Neuron pairs located in the same barrel column coded redundantly, whereas pairs in neighboring barrel columns coded independently. The barrel cortical population code for stimulus location appears to be the time of single neurons' first poststimulus spikes—a fast, robust coding mechanism that does not rely on “synergy” in crossneuronal spike patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2039589874,"We identified a novel cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)-associating, PDZ domain-containing protein, CAL (CFTR associatedligand) containing two predicted coiled-coiled domains and one PDZ domain. The PDZ domain of CAL binds to the C terminus of CFTR. Although CAL does not have any predicted transmembrane domains, CAL is associated with membranes mediated by a region containing the coiled-coil domains. CAL is located primarily at the Golgi apparatus, co-localizing with trans-Golgi markers and is sensitive to Brefeldin A treatment. Immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that CAL exists as a multimer. Overexpression of CAL reduces CFTR chloride currents in mammalian cells and decreases expression, rate of insertion and half-life of CFTR in the plasma membrane. The Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor, NHE-RF, a subplasma membrane PDZ domain protein, restores cell surface expression of CFTR and chloride currents. In addition, NHE-RF inhibits the binding of CAL to CFTR. CAL modulates the surface expression of CFTR. CAL favors retention of CFTR within the cell, whereas NHE-RF favors surface expression by competing with CAL for the binding of CFTR. Thus, the regulation of CFTR in the plasma membrane involves the dynamic interaction between at least two PDZ domain proteins.

CFTR is a cAMP-regulated chloride channel and channel regulator (4Schwiebert E.M. Benos D.J. Egan M.E. Stutts M.J. Guggino W.B. Physiol.

Cell. 1999; 96: 607-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In many polarized epithelial tissues, CFTR functions in the apical cell membrane but in the sweat duct CFTR is localized to both the apical and basolateral cell membranes. Because a common mutation in CFTR, ΔF508, is degraded through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated processes, many studies have focused on the trafficking of CFTR through this compartment (6Kopito R.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: S167-S173Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Much less attention has been devoted to how CFTR is processed through the post-ER pathways. We reported previously that the polarization of CFTR in the apical membrane of human airway and kidney epithelial cells is altered in CFTR mutants lacking the C-terminal domain (7Moyer B.D. Denton J. Karlson K.H. Reynolds D. Wang S. Mickle J.E. Milewski M. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B. Li M. Stanton B.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1353-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 8Moyer B.D.

These data suggested that the C-terminal domain plays a role either in the trafficking to and/or stability within the plasma membrane. The last three amino acids of CFTR (Thr-Arg-Leu) comprise a consensus sequence known to bind to PDZ domain proteins, a family of proteins containing a 80- to 90-amino acid motif that binds to the C terminus of a variety of ion channels and receptors (9Bredt D.S.

At least two PDZ domain-containing proteins, Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor, NHE-RF (also called EBP50), and the CFTR-associated protein CAP70 are known to bind to the terminal amino acids of CFTR (12Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D. Kreda S.M. Bretscher A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Biol.

Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Because NHE-RF associates with ezrin, which itself binds to the regulatory subunit of PKA (15Dransfield D.T. Bradford A.J. Smith J. Martin M. Roy C. Mangeat P.H. Goldenring J.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that NHE-RF anchors CFTR to the cytoskeleton at a subapical compartment targeting protein kinase A near CFTR (12Short D.B. Trotter K.W. Reczek D. Kreda S.M. Bretscher A. Boucher R.C. Stutts M.J. Milgram S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19797-19801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). E3KARP, an NHE-RF-related protein, was also shown to interact with CFTR (16Sun F. Hug M.J. Bradbury N.A. Frizzell R.A. J. Biol.

CAP70, a subapical protein with four PDZ domains, binds to at least two CFTR molecules simultaneously via PDZ3 and PDZ4 (18Wang S. Yue H. Derin R.B. Guggino W.B. Li M. Cell. 2000; 103: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). CAP70 and NHE-RF enhance CFTR Cl− channel activity in excised patches probably by cross-linking CFTR dimers (18Wang S. Yue H. Derin R.B. Guggino W.B. Li M. Cell. 2000; 103: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar,19Raghuram V. Mak D.D. Foskett J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1300-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). NHE-RF, E3KARP, and CAP70 are localized to subplasma membrane regions reflecting their proposed roles in anchoring and/or regulating CFTR. Although there is growing evidence of a functional interaction between CFTR and PDZ domain proteins at the plasma membrane, little is known about whether PDZ domain proteins play a role in intracellular trafficking of CFTR along the ER, the Golgi, and the plasma membrane. The post-ER secretory pathway involved in the trafficking of wild type and mutant CFTR to the plasma membrane is poorly characterized. A recent study has demonstrated that CFTR has an unusually low distribution in cis-Golgi compartments compared with most membrane proteins (20Bannykh S.I. Bannykh G.I. Fish K.N. Moyer B.D. Riordan J.R. Balch W.E. Traffic. 2000; 1: 852-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that CFTR may utilize novel modes of anterograde and retrograde trafficking mechanisms. To learn more about the role of the C terminus of CFTR in processing and trafficking, we used a yeast-two hybrid assay to identify proteins that bind to CFTR. We identified a novel PDZ domain protein, CAL, that interacts with CFTR in the post-ER secretory pathway. The PDZ domain of CAL binds directly to the C terminus of CFTR. Native CFTR and CAL localize with Golgi markers in lung tissue in vivo. Overexpression of CAL suppresses CFTR expression at the cell surface and reduces CFTR currents both in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells. This suppression can be overcome by NHE-RF. Our data demonstrate that CAL modulates the surface expression of CFTR. Although NHE-RF alone does not enhance surface expression of CFTR, it competes with CAL for the binding of CFTR and indirectly enhances expression in the plasma membrane. Thus, the expression of CFTR in the plasma membrane involves the dynamic interaction between at least two PDZ domain proteins. Yeast two-hybrid screening was used to identify proteins that interact with the C terminus of CFTR (21Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). The bait consisted of the C-terminal 51 amino acids of rat CFTR (aa 1428–1478 of rCFTR), amplified by PCR from a rat lung MATCHMAKER cDNA library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The PCR products were subcloned into theBamHI/PstI sites of a pAS2-1 vector, in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain. Approximately 1 × 107 recombinants of a rat lung MATCHMAKER cDNA library fused to the Gal4 activation domain (CLONTECH) were screened for interaction with the bait protein in Y190 yeast cells on triple-minus plates supplemented with 35 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) (Leu−, Trp−, His−, 3-AT). A rat CAL (rCAL) fragment identified in yeast two-hybrid screening was used to screen a human lung cDNA library (CLONTECH) to obtain the full-length human CAL (hCAL). Cloned inserts were sequenced in both directions by automated fluorescent sequencing (Johns Hopkins University Biosynthesis & Sequencing Facility). A partial rat CAL truncated at the extreme N terminus was also obtained by hybridization screening of a rat hippocampus library (gift from Drs. A. A. Lanahan and P. F. Worley). rCFTRΔC4 (aa 1428–1474) and rCFTRΔC7 (aa 1428–1471) were subcloned into theBamHI/PstI sites of the pAS2-1 vector, in-frame with the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (CLONTECH). rCFTRΔC4, rCFTRΔC7, or the empty pAS2-1 vector were co-transformed with rCAL (in pGAD10 vector) into Y190 cells. Interactions were monitored by the LacZ expression on filter lifted from the transformed cells and by counting viable colonies on triple-minus plates (Leu−, Trp−, His−, 35 mm 3-AT). Human embryonic kidney cell line HEK 293 and colorectal carcinoma T84 cells (obtained from American Type Tissue Culture, Manassas, VA) were maintained in DMEM:F-12 (1:1),l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% FCS. African green monkey kidney cell (COS-7) and Madin-Darby Canine Kidney II cells (MDCK) (obtained from American Type Tissue Culture) were maintained in DMEM, l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, 10% FCS. Human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBE14o−, gift of Dr. Dieter Gruenert) were maintained in minimal essential medium, l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% FCS. Cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cells (IB3–1) (22Zeitlin P.L. Lu L. Rhim J. Cutting G. Stetten G. Kieffer K.A. Craig R. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1991; 4: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) were maintained in LHC-8 basal medium, l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and 5% FCS. LHC-8 basal medium was purchased from Biofluids. All other media and components were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). l-Glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) were used. COS-7, IB3–1, MDCK, and 16HBE14o−cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE or LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein of C-terminal polypeptide (aa 216–454) from human CAL was prepared using the GST gene fusion system (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). The Precision protease-cleaved CAL C-terminal polypeptide was sent to a commercial producer (Covance, Princeton, NJ) to prepare rabbit polyclonal antibodies. The HA and myc-tagged constructs were made by PCR amplification and subcloning intoSalI/NotI sites of the HA-tagged pRK5 vector (pRK5-HA) and myc-tagged pRK5 vector (pRK5-myc), respectively (gifts from Drs. A. A. Lanahan, P. F. Worley, H. Dong, and R. L. Huganir, Johns Hopkins University). The resulting constructs contain HA or myc tag at the N terminus of the fusion proteins (Fig.1C). The GFP-tagged constructs were made by PCR amplification and subcloning into the SalI/NotI sites of the pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH). The resulting constructs contain EGFP tag at the C terminus of the fusion proteins (Fig. 1C). All constructs were sequence-verified. Other plasmid constructs used were HA-NHE-RF (13Wang S. Raab R.W. Schatz P.J. Guggino W.B. Li M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), GFP-CFTR and GFP-CFTRΔTRL (7Moyer B.D. Denton J. Karlson K.H. Reynolds D. Wang S. Mickle J.E.

Multiple human tissue poly(A) RNA blots (MTB1 and MTB2, CLONTECH) containing 16 human tissue poly(A) RNAs were hybridized with full-length hCAL probes under stringent conditions according to the manufacturer's directions. Cells were harvested and processed as described previously (23Moyer B.D. Loffing J. Schwiebert E.M. Loffing-Cueni D. Halpin P.A. Karlson K.H. Ismailov I.I. Guggino W.B. Langford G.M. Stanton B.A. J.

Briefly, cells were solubilized and lysates were spun at 14,000 × g for 15 min to pellet insoluble material. The supernatants were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of monoclonal Myc antibody, HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IL), R domain CFTR antibody (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA) or polyclonal GFP antibody (CLONTECH), and CAL antibody followed by Protein G-agarose beads for R domain CFTR antibody or Protein A-agarose beads for all other antibodies. The eluted proteins were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Piscataway, NJ). GFP-CFTR was detected with monoclonal GFP antibody (1:1000; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). HA-CAL, HA-NHE-RF, and other HA-tagged molecules were detected with monoclonal HA antibody (1:2000; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Endogenous CAL was detected by CAL antibodies. Endogenous CFTR was detected by immunoprecipitation with R domain CFTR antibody (Genzyme) followed by protein kinase A phosphorylation as described previously (24Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J.

Biotinylated peptides were first incubated with immobilized NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce, catalog number 53151) in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed three times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. 500 μg of cell lysate in a total volume of 500 μl was added to 25 μg of immobilized NeutrAvidin beads and tumbled at 4 °C for 2 h. Samples were washed three times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with 2× Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 100 μm DTT at 42 °C for 30 min. Eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Biotinylated peptides used were CFTRCT, Biotin-SGSGSKPQIAALLEETEEEVQDTRL; CFTRCT2, Biotin-TEEEVQDTRL; and JN33, Biotin-MNRVIEEDGTSA (C terminus of human frizzled-3). Biotinylated CFTR at the plasma membrane was precipitated as described in detail previously with some modifications (23Moyer B.D. Loffing J. Schwiebert E.M. Loffing-Cueni D. Halpin P.A. Karlson K.H.

Lysates were incubated with immobilized NeutrAvidin beads (Pierce, catalog number 53151), and bound proteins were eluted with 2× Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 100 μmDTT at 42 °C for 30 min. The eluted proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot. GFP-CFTR was detected with monoclonal GFP antibody (1:1000; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For VSVG surface biotinylation, COS-7 cells were transfected with full-length VSVG. VSVG was detected with rabbit anti-VSVG polyclonal antibody (25Weisz O.A. Swift A.M. Machamer C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1185-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, COS-7 cells were washed twice in methionine/cysteine free DMEM and then incubated for 60 min in methionine/cysteine free DMEM. Cells were incubated in methionine/cysteine free DMEM containing Tran35S-label (250 μCi/ml) for 30 min. Subsequently, cells were washed extensively with DMEM containing 10 mm of non-labeled methionine and 10 mm of unlabeled cysteine and chased in this solution for 0, 30, 60, 90, or 120 min. Biotinylated CFTR at the plasma membrane was immunoprecipitated as described previously (23Moyer B.D. Loffing J. Schwiebert E.M. Loffing-Cueni D. Halpin P.A. Karlson K.H. Ismailov I.I. Guggino W.B.

Radiolabeled CFTR was analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). To examine the effect of CAL overexpression on the half-life of CFTR in the plasma membrane, cells were incubated in methionine/cysteine free DMEM containing Tran35S-label (250 μCi/ml) for 3 h. Cells were washed extensively with DMEM containing 10 mm non-labeled methionine and 10 mm unlabeled cysteine (containing penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FBS) and chased in this solution for 0, 12, 24, or 32 h. Plasma membrane proteins were biotinylated at 0, 12, 24, or 32 h, and biotinylated CFTR was immunoprecipitated using a GFP monoclonal antibody. Radiolabeled CFTR was analyzed using a PhosphorImager. For subcellular fractionation experiments, cells were trypsinized and collected by centrifugation. The pellet were resuspended and incubated in ice-cold swelling buffer (1 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) for 5 min. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer containing 0.25 msucrose, 3 mm imidazole, pH 7.4, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture. Lysate was obtained by homogenizing 10 strokes with a Dounce homogenizer. After a pre-clarification centrifugation (100 × g, 4 °C, 5 min), the lysate was spun in an Ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C in a centrifuge (TL-100) using a TLA-100.2 rotor (both from Beckman Coulter). α-Tubulin monoclonal antibody was obtained from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. Cultured cells were plated on glass coverslips 1-day post-transfection and examined 2-days post-transfection. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.2% Nonidet P-40. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% normal goat serum (NGS). Cells were stained with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:2000, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or γ-adaptin (1:10, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) in 5% NGS, washed with 1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with goat anti-mouse Cy3 secondary antibodies in 1% NGS. In some cases, cells were counter-stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole (200 μg/ml, Sigma) to visualize nuclei. Specimens were mounted and viewed on an LSM 410 confocal microscope (Zeiss). The immunofluorescence of rat tracheae was performed exactly as described (26Loffing J. Moyer B.D. Reynolds D. Shmukler B.E. Alper S.L. Stanton B.A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C1016-C1023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sections of frozen tracheae 6 μm thick were incubated with the following antibodies: rabbit-anti-CAL (1:500), mouse-anti-β-COP (1:50, Sigma), mouse-anti-58K (1:50, Sigma), and mouse-anti-TGN38 (1:50, Oncogene, Cambridge, MA). Whole-cell recordings were performed at room temperature on COS-7 cells grown on glass coverslips 1–2 days post-transfection. Cells were treated with 0.5 mg/ml sodium butyrate for 16 h the day before the experiments as described (23Moyer B.D. Loffing J. Schwiebert E.M. Loffing-Cueni D. Halpin P.A. Karlson K.H. Ismailov I.I.

Transfected cells expressing GFP-CFTR were identified under a fluorescence microscope (TE200, Nikon). Coverslips were perfused with an extracellular solution containing (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 20 sucrose, 0.1 DIDS, and 10 Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH). Sucrose and DIDS were used to prevent the activation of endogenous chloride currents. Pipette resistance, with a pipette solution (PS) containing (in mm) 150 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 Na2ATP, 1 EGTA, 10 Hepes (pH 7.4 with Tris), ranged between 5 and 8 MΩ. The input capacitance ranged from 11 to 64 picofarads. pClamp8 software (Axon Instruments) was used to sample and analyze data. Current-voltage (I-V) relationships were obtained at 100 ms of each voltage step from a holding potential of 0 mV. Junction potentials between extracellular solution and PS were measured using a 3m KCl bridge and were <2 mV. Therefore no correction for these potentials was made. Extracellular membrane-permeant cAMP analogue 8-chlorophenyl-thio-cAMP (cpt-cAMP, 250 μm) was applied using a nearby pipette of 30- to 35-μm diameter. To identify PDZ domain proteins that interact with CFTR, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the last 51 amino acids of the C terminus of rat CFTR (21Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 × 107 recombinants of a lung cDNA library fused to the Gal4 DNA activation domain were screened. A novel protein designated as CAL (CFTR-Associated Ligand) was identified in this screening. Fifty-six clones were isolated that encoded overlapping, partial sequences of CAL. Each contained the consensus sequence for a complete PDZ domain. The interaction between CFTR and CAL was confirmed by re-transforming the cloned cDNA into yeast. The interaction was bait-dependent, because it did not occur with the vector alone. The interaction was also dependent upon the terminal amino acids of CFTR, because it did not occur with CFTR C-terminal constructs missing the terminal 4 or 7 amino acids (data not shown). To obtain the full-length CAL, we screened a human lung cDNA library (CLONTECH) with rat CAL cDNA. Seven independent and overlapping clones were identified. The largest fragment contained a 1362-bp open reading frame, preceded 132 bp upstream by an in-frame stop codon. A start codon consistent with a Kozak consensus sequence (27Kozak M. Mamm. Genome. 1996; 7: 563-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) was identified. Translation in this reading frame predicts a 454-amino acid polypeptide with an estimated molecular mass of 50 kDa (Fig.1A). Hydropathy analysis did not detect any putative membrane-spanning regions (28Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17297) Google Scholar). No targeting signal sequence was detected. The carboxyl half of CAL is identical to the amino half of an aberrant clone Homo sapiens RNA for ros1 oncogene (29Birchmeier C. Sharma S. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 9270-9274Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This aberrant clone very likely results from the rearrangement of CAL to the human ros1 oncogene. CAL mapped to chromosome 6q21A by aligning to a finished human genomic sequence (PAC 94G16) in GenBankTM (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). A rat CAL cDNA that is highly homologous to the human CAL (91% identity, 94% conserved) was obtained in a hybridization screen (Fig. 1A). Human CAL is also highly homologous (56% identity, 71% homology) to a protein identified in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome project (ZK849.2) suggesting an evolutionarily conserved function (Fig.1A), as well as to a recently described protein (31Charest A. Lane K. McMahon K. Housman D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29456-29465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition to a PDZ domain, CAL is predicted to have two coiled-coil domains. Coiled-coil domains are also involved in protein-protein interactions (32Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar). The co-existence of coiled-coil domains and a PDZ domain suggests that CAL can potentially interact with multiple proteins. Northern blot analysis detected CAL in all human tissues examined, including CFTR-expressing tissues such as lung and pancreas (Fig.1B). The major transcript is 5 kb; in addition, some tissues have less abundant transcripts of different sizes (e.g.pancreas and testis). The ubiquitous expression pattern and evolutionarily conserved protein sequence of CAL suggest an essential housekeeping role for its interaction with CFTR and other membrane proteins with similar PDZ binding motifs. To study CAL in vivo, we generated a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the C-terminal domain of human CAL (see “Experimental Procedures”). Consistent with the wide pattern of expression of CAL mRNA, CAL protein is endogenously expressed in several cell lines, including human bronchial epithelial cells, 16HBE14o− (Fig.2A), the colonic carcinoma T84 cell line (see related data in Fig.3D) and in the cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial cell line, IB3–1 (data not shown). In Western blots, 16HBE14o− cells display native CAL at two molecular masses, ∼50-kDa and ∼100-kDa bands (Fig. 2A,Lysate), when analyzed under non-reducing conditions, but only a single ∼50-kDa band (Fig. 2A,+βME and +DTT) when analyzed under reducing conditions. This raises the possibility that CAL can form a homo-multimer. To test this further, we cotransfected HEK293 cells with HA-tagged full-length CAL (HA-CAL) and with each one of the following myc-tagged CAL constructs: full-length (myc-CAL), a construct containing only the C-terminal portion, including the PDZ domain (myc-CAL-PDZ-C), or a construct containing only the N-terminal amino acids, including the coiled-coil domains but minus the PDZ domain (myc-CAL-N-CC). Only in cells containing the myc-tagged full-length CAL (first lane) and the N-terminal portion of CAL (third lane) was it possible to immunoprecipitate HA-tagged full-length CAL with anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 2C). The myc-labeled C-terminal portion is not capable of precipitating HA-tagged full-length CAL (second lane). These data demonstrate that CAL forms a homo-multimer and the self-association domain lies in the N-terminal half of CAL.Figure 3Biochemical characterization of CAL and CFTRinteraction.

To begin to understand dendritic RNA targeting, we cloned a rat homolog of staufen, a Drosophila gene that participates in mRNA targeting during development. In hippocampal neurons, rat staufen protein displays a microtubule-dependent somatodendritic distribution pattern that overlaps with dendritic RNAs. To determine whether r-staufen is required for dendritic RNA targeting, we constructed a mutant version containing the RNA binding domains (stau-RBD) but lacking the C-terminal portion potentially involved in dendritic targeting. Stau-RBD expression was restricted to the cell bodies and proximal dendrites. Expression of stau-RBD significantly decreased, while overexpression of wild-type r-staufen increased, the amount of dendritic mRNA. Taken together, these results suggest that the rat staufen protein plays an important role in the delivery of RNA to dendrites."
https://openalex.org/W2025664849,"The ability of native uncoupling protein-3 (UCP3) to uncouple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation is controversial. We measured the expression level of UCP3 and the proton conductance of skeletal muscle mitochondria isolated from transgenic mice overexpressing human UCP3 (UCP3-tg) and from UCP3 knockout (UCP3-KO) mice. The concentration of UCP3 in UCP3-tg mitochondria was ∼3 μg/mg protein, ∼20-fold higher than the wild type value. UCP3-tg mitochondria had increased nonphosphorylating respiration rates, decreased respiratory control, and ∼4-fold increased proton conductance compared with the wild type. However, this increased uncoupling in UCP3-tg mitochondria was not caused by native function of UCP3 because it was not proportional to the increase in UCP3 concentration and was neither activated by superoxide nor inhibited by GDP. UCP3 was undetectable in mitochondria from UCP3-KO mice. Nevertheless, UCP3-KO mitochondria had unchanged respiration rates, respiratory control ratios, and proton conductance compared with the wild type under a variety of assay conditions. We conclude that uncoupling in UCP3-tg mice is an artifact of transgenic expression, and that UCP3 does not catalyze the basal proton conductance of skeletal muscle mitochondria in the absence of activators such as superoxide.

However, it is unclear what expression levels were achieved and whether this uncoupling is a native function of UCP3. Two recent studies using UCP3 knockout mice show that the lack of UCP3 is not associated with obesity or with decreased metabolic rate (31Gong D.-W. Monemdjou S. Gavrilova O. Leon L.R.

Our results indicate that UCP3 does not contribute to the basal proton conductance of skeletal muscle mitochondria.DISCUSSIONTransgenic mice overexpressing human UCP3 in skeletal muscle are lean despite being hyperphagic (30Clapham J.C.

In the present study, we have confirmed that UCP3-tg mice (both male and female) weigh less than the wild type (Table I). We reported previously that skeletal muscle mitochondria from UCP3-tg mice are uncoupled as shown by decreased respiratory control ratio, increased state 4 respiration rate, and decreased membrane potential (30Clapham J.C.

Table III confirms these observations. In the present study we show directly that skeletal muscle mitochondria from UCP3-tg mice have ∼4-fold greater proton conductance than wild type controls (Figs. 2a and3c).The concentration of UCP3 in wild type mouse muscle mitochondria is very low, ∼140 ng of UCP3/mg of mitochondrial protein (13Harper J.A.

We find that skeletal muscle mitochondria from UCP3-tg mice contain ∼3 μg of hUCP3/mg of protein (Fig. 1 and Table II), which is ∼20 times the endogenous mUCP3 background, and corresponds quite well to the 66-fold increase in UCP3 mRNA in these animals (30Clapham J.C.

Nature. 2000; 406: 415-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar).There are two lines of evidence that lead to the conclusion that the greater mitochondrial proton conductance in UCP3-tg mouse mitochondria compared with controls is not a reflection of any native uncoupling activity of UCP3. First, UCP3 protein concentration was 20-fold higher in UCP3-tg mitochondria (Table II), but proton conductance increased only ∼4-fold (Figs. 2a and 3c). Either endogenous mUCP3 catalyzes 20% or less of the basal proton conductance of mitochondria from mouse skeletal muscle (so increasing this small component 20-fold increased the overall conductance only 4-fold), or the exogenous hUCP3 was substantially less active in proton translocation than the endogenous mUCP3. Second, there was no increase in native activity of UCP3 in skeletal muscle mitochondria from UCP3-tg mice (Fig. 3). Native function of UCP1 in brown adipose tissue mitochondria or heterologous expression systems can be tested by its sensitivity to purine nucleotides such as GDP (17Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Brindle K.M. Jekabsons M.B. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 779-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that uncoupling by native UCP3 in skeletal muscle mitochondria can be activated by superoxide in the presence of fatty acids, and that this activation is completely inhibited by low concentrations of purine nucleotides (29Echtay K.S. Roussel D. St-Pierre J. Jekabsons M.B. Cadenas S. Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Roebuck S.J. Morrison A. Pickering S. Clapham J.C. Brand M.D. Nature. 2002; 415: 96-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (1129) Google Scholar). This provides an assay for native UCP3 function analogous to that for UCP1: uncoupling caused by UCP3 expression that can be stimulated by superoxide and inhibited by GDP is native, and uncoupling that cannot be manipulated in this way is a non-native expression artifact. We have used this assay to show that uncoupling by hUCP3 expressed in yeast mitochondria is an expression artifact (13Harper J.A. Stuart J.A. Jekabsons M.B. Roussel D. Brindle K.M. Dickinson K. Jones R.B. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We conclude from the present results (Fig. 3) that the uncoupling observed in skeletal muscle mitochondria from UCP3-tg mice, like the uncoupling caused by mammalian UCP3 in yeast mitochondria, is some sort of UCP3 expression artifact that does not reflect any native proton conductance function of UCP3.Artifactual uncoupling associated with UCP3 overexpression might be caused by non-native insertion, folding, or interactions of the protein in the inner membrane, leading to compromised membrane integrity. There are several examples of artifactual proton conductance caused by overexpression of UCPs and related mitochondrial carrier proteins; UCP1 (17Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Brindle K.M. Jekabsons M.B.

The inability of overexpressed UCP3 to catalyze superoxide-stimulated proton conductance is probably because of poor protein insertion or folding, although limitation by some unrecognized endogenous cofactor also remains a formal possible explanation.Even if uncoupling of skeletal muscle mitochondria by UCP3 in UCP3-tg mice is not physiological, observations that uncoupling of muscle mitochondria in vivo leads to hyperphagia (30Clapham J.C.

Overexpression of a protein can lead to artifacts, whereas disruption of the gene for a native protein can lead to unambiguous conclusions; if a phenotype remains after a gene is knocked out, then that gene cannot be solely responsible for the phenotype.

However, some experimental intervention studies and clinical trials of ARIs on diabetic neuropathy appeared disappointing because of either 1) their inadequate design and, in particular, insufficient correction of the sorbitol pathway activity or 2) the inability to reverse established functional and metabolic deficits of diabetic neuropathy by AR inhibition in general. We evaluated whether diabetes-induced changes in nerve function, metabolism, and antioxidative defense are corrected by the dose of ARI (sorbinil, 65 mg/kg/d in the diet), resulting in complete inhibition of increased sorbitol pathway activity. The groups included control rats and streptozotocin-diabetic rats treated with/without ARI for 2 weeks after 4 weeks of untreated diabetes. ARI treatment corrected diabetes-induced nerve functional changes; that is, decrease in endoneurial nutritive blood flow, motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities, and metabolic abnormalities (i.e., mitochondrial and cytosolic NAD+/NADH redox imbalances and energy deficiency). ARI restored nerve concentrations of two major non-enzymatic antioxidants, reduced glutathione (GSH) and ascorbate, and completely arrested diabetes-induced lipid peroxidation. In conclusion, treatment with adequate doses of ARIs (that is, doses that completely inhibit increased sorbitol pathway activity) is an effective approach for reversal of, at least, early diabetic neuropathy."

It is often assumed that visual deprivation has minimal effect, if any, on neuronal function in retina. Here we report that dark rearing reduces the light-evoked responsiveness of inner retinal neurons in young mice. We also find that 1 to 2 weeks after eye opening, there is a surge (>4-fold) in the frequency of spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory synaptic events in ganglion cells. Dark rearing reversibly suppresses this surge, but recovery takes >6 days. Frequency changes are not accompanied by amplitude changes, indicating that synaptic reorganization is likely to be presynaptic.

Identification of additional target proteins of Akt should provide greater insight into the precise role of this kinase in the regulation of cell survival and apoptosis.c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), also known as stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), is a member of the family of mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinases and mediates intracellular signaling associated with a variety of cellular functions including cell death (15Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar, 17Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). The JNK/SAPK pathway is activated by proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1, as well as by cellular stress including UV irradiation, genotoxic stress, and heat (15Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). This pathway consists of three components: a MAP3K such as MEKK1, a MAP2K such as SEK1 (also known as JNKK1 or MKK4) or MKK7, and JNK/SAPK. Activated MEKK1 (or an equivalent MAP3K) phosphorylates and activates SEK1 or MKK7, which in turn phosphorylates and activates JNK/SAPK (15Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar,16Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Activated JNK/SAPK then phosphorylates substrates that include several nuclear transcription factors such as Elk-1, c-Jun, and ATF-2 (18Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R.

Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar).To clarify the molecular mechanisms by which Akt modulates intracellular signaling cascades, we have investigated the effects of Akt on the components of the JNK/SAPK pathway. We now show that SEK1 is a target of Akt. Activated Akt physically interacts with and phosphorylates SEK1, thereby suppressing SEK1-mediated signaling, in intact cells.DISCUSSIONWe have shown that Akt inhibits the activation of SEK1, suggesting that SEK1 is an intracellular target of Akt. The negative regulation of SEK1 by Akt is further supported by our observation that endogenous Akt, when activated, physically interacts with endogenous SEK1 in intact cells. Furthermore, Akt phosphorylates SEK1 both in vitro and in vivo. Site-specific mutagenesis data indicated that the phosphorylation of mouse SEK1 by Akt occurs on Ser78, a residue that is located within a consensus phosphorylation sequence (RXRXX(S/T)) for this kinase (4Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3704) Google Scholar, 7Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem.

Taken together, our data indicate that activated Akt physically associates with and phosphorylates SEK1, thereby inhibiting SEK1 activation and, consequently, the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway.In this study we demonstrate that Akt-mediated SEK1 phosphorylation on Ser78 results in a decrease in the binding of SEK1 to JNK1 in cells. Thus, inhibition of the interaction between SEK1 and JNK may be a possible mechanism by which Akt-mediated SEK1 phosphorylation inhibits SEK1 activity. Other possibilities could be also proposed. For instance, Ser78 phosphorylation might directly inhibit the catalytic mechanism of SEK1, or interfere with the activation of SEK1 by a MAP3K. Further studies are needed to clarify these possibilities.The JNK/SAPK signaling pathway mediates many cellular events including cell death (15Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys.

Res. 2000; 62: 799-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which Akt suppresses the JNK signaling pathway has remained unclear. Activated Akt has been shown recently to phosphorylate and inhibit ASK1, a MAP3K that stimulates JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways (14Kim A.H. Khursigara G. Sun X. Franke T.F. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Our data now suggest that SEK1 is another target of Akt in the stress-activated protein kinase pathways. Thus, Akt may tightly regulate stress-activated signals through phosphorylation of both SEK1 and ASK1 in the JNK/SAPK signaling cascade. In summary, our study demonstrates that the inhibition of SEK1 by Akt may be an integral component of the mechanism by which Akt functions as a survival factor and as a negative regulator of the stress-activated signals. Akt, also known as protein kinase B, is a serine-threonine kinase that plays an important role in a variety of biological processes including cell survival, cell growth, gene expression, and oncogenesis (1Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Various peptide growth factors, including insulin and insulin-like growth factor I, induce the activation of Akt as a result of their triggering of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)1 signaling pathway (2Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 3Downward J. Curr. Opin.

The binding of such growth factors to their cell surface receptors results in the recruitment of PI3K to the plasma membrane (4Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3704) Google Scholar) and the consequent phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol, which generates phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (5Franke T.F.

The interaction of these phosphoinositides with the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt is responsible for the translocation of this enzyme from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane (1Chan T.O.

Identification of additional target proteins of Akt should provide greater insight into the precise role of this kinase in the regulation of cell survival and apoptosis. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), also known as stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK), is a member of the family of mammalian mitogen-activated protein kinases and mediates intracellular signaling associated with a variety of cellular functions including cell death (15Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar, 17Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1396) Google Scholar). The JNK/SAPK pathway is activated by proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1, as well as by cellular stress including UV irradiation, genotoxic stress, and heat (15Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). This pathway consists of three components: a MAP3K such as MEKK1, a MAP2K such as SEK1 (also known as JNKK1 or MKK4) or MKK7, and JNK/SAPK. Activated MEKK1 (or an equivalent MAP3K) phosphorylates and activates SEK1 or MKK7, which in turn phosphorylates and activates JNK/SAPK (15Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F104PubMed Google Scholar,16Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Activated JNK/SAPK then phosphorylates substrates that include several nuclear transcription factors such as Elk-1, c-Jun, and ATF-2 (18Sanchez I. Hughes R.T. Mayer B.J. Yee K. Woodgett J.R. Avruch J. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Nature. 1994; 372: 794-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 19Cavigelli M. Dolfi F. Claret F.X. Karin M.

To clarify the molecular mechanisms by which Akt modulates intracellular signaling cascades, we have investigated the effects of Akt on the components of the JNK/SAPK pathway. We now show that SEK1 is a target of Akt. Activated Akt physically interacts with and phosphorylates SEK1, thereby suppressing SEK1-mediated signaling, in intact cells. DISCUSSIONWe have shown that Akt inhibits the activation of SEK1, suggesting that SEK1 is an intracellular target of Akt. The negative regulation of SEK1 by Akt is further supported by our observation that endogenous Akt, when activated, physically interacts with endogenous SEK1 in intact cells. Furthermore, Akt phosphorylates SEK1 both in vitro and in vivo. Site-specific mutagenesis data indicated that the phosphorylation of mouse SEK1 by Akt occurs on Ser78, a residue that is located within a consensus phosphorylation sequence (RXRXX(S/T)) for this kinase (4Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3704) Google Scholar, 7Marte B.M. Downward J. Trends Biochem.

Taken together, our data indicate that activated Akt physically associates with and phosphorylates SEK1, thereby inhibiting SEK1 activation and, consequently, the JNK/SAPK signaling pathway.In this study we demonstrate that Akt-mediated SEK1 phosphorylation on Ser78 results in a decrease in the binding of SEK1 to JNK1 in cells. Thus, inhibition of the interaction between SEK1 and JNK may be a possible mechanism by which Akt-mediated SEK1 phosphorylation inhibits SEK1 activity. Other possibilities could be also proposed. For instance, Ser78 phosphorylation might directly inhibit the catalytic mechanism of SEK1, or interfere with the activation of SEK1 by a MAP3K. Further studies are needed to clarify these possibilities.The JNK/SAPK signaling pathway mediates many cellular events including cell death (15Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys.

We now show that death-associated protein (DAP) kinase plays an important role in mediating this effect. Upon incubation with C6-Cer, DAP kinase levels are elevated as early as 1 h after treatment, reaching levels 2–3-fold higher than untreated cells after 4 h. Neurons cultured from DAP kinase-deficient mice were significantly less sensitive to apoptosis induced by C6-Cer or by ceramide generated by high concentrations of nerve growth factor. A peptide corresponding to the 17 amino acids at the C terminus of DAP kinase protected wild type neurons from C6-Cer-induced death and from death induced by the addition of exogenous bacterial neutral sphingomyelinase, whereas a scrambled peptide had no protective effect, implying that the DAP kinase C-terminal tail inhibits the function of DAP kinase. Together, these data demonstrate that DAP kinase plays a central role in ceramide-induced cell death in neurons, but the pathway in which DAP kinase is involved is not the only one via which ceramide can induce apoptosis.

DAP kinase has a multidomain structure that is unique among members of the extended family of calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (5Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). In addition to the kinase domain and the typical calmodulin regulatory segment, the protein has eight ankyrin repeats, a cytoskeleton binding region, and a conserved death domain (1Deiss L.P. Feinstein E. Berissi H. Cohen O. Kimchi A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 6Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The pro-apoptotic function of DAP kinase requires the joint action of several domains (reviewed in Ref. 7Cohen O. Kimchi A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and depends on autophosphorylation (8Shohat G. Spivak-Kroizman T. Cohen O. Bialik S. Shani G. Berrisi H. Eisenstein M. Kimchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47460-47467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). One important region was recently discovered by a genetic screen based on functional selection of random short DAP kinase-derived cDNA fragments that protect cells from apoptosis by inhibiting the function of the endogenous full-length protein (9Raveh T. Berissi H. Eisenstein M. Spivak T. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1572-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). One of the biologically active DAP kinase fragments corresponded to the last 17 amino acids at the C-terminal of the protein, which immediately follows the death domain. When ectopically expressed, the DAP kinase C-terminal tail peptide inhibited the function of DAP kinase. Its removal from the protein results in enhanced killing activity, indicating that the tail is autoinhibitory, possibly preventing the function of adjacent domains in DAP kinase (9Raveh T. Berissi H. Eisenstein M. Spivak T. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1572-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the developing and adult rat central nervous system, DAP kinase mRNA is widely expressed in proliferative and postmitotic regions within the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar Purkinje cells, from embryonic day 13 and onward (10Yamamoto M. Takahashi H. Nakamura T. Hioki T. Nagayama S. Ooashi N. Sun X. Ishii T. Kudo Y. Nakajima-Iijima S. Kimchi A. Uchino S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 674-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Expression in the brain is markedly decreased postnatally but remains high in a number of areas, particularly the hippocampus. This temporal and spatial regulation of DAP kinase expression suggests that it may be involved in various neuronal functions, including neuronal cell death. This possibility is supported by the elevation of DAP kinase mRNA levels prior to cell death induced by transient forebrain ischemia (10Yamamoto M. Takahashi H. Nakamura T. Hioki T. Nagayama S.

A death-promoting molecule that has received wide attention recently is ceramide, which is produced in response to a number of stimuli in various cell types (11Kolesnick R.N. Kronke M. Annu. Rev.

We now show, by comparing the death response of wild type hippocampal neurons to the corresponding DAP kinase null cells, that DAP kinase is involved in mediating the apoptotic effects of ceramide on hippocampal neurons in culture. In addition, a peptide, with a composition identical to the last 17 C-terminal amino acids of DAP kinase blocks the apoptotic response of hippocampal neurons to ceramide and to bacterial sphingomyelinase (bSMase), suggesting that DAP kinase plays an important role in ceramide-induced neuronal cell death.

Hippocampal neurons from embryonic day 17 DAP kinase−/− 3Complete details of the generation of the DAP kinase null mice, which are viable and fertile, will be published elsewhere. and wild type (+/+) mice were cultured at low density exactly as described for rat neurons. In some experiments, coverslips were placed in multidishes containing B27-supplemented neurobasal medium (19Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar), and cultures were maintained in this medium in the absence of a co-culture of a glial monolayer. Neurons co-cultured with a glial monolayer or cultured in B27-supplemented medium contained <2–5% non-neuronal cells. Neurons cultured at high density (230,000 cells per 24-mm glass coverslip in 60- or 100-mm Petri dishes), maintained either with a co-culture of glia in minimal essential medium with N2supplements, or in B27-supplemented neurobasal medium, were used for Western blotting. Neurons were treated with or withoutN-hexanoyl-d-sphingosine (C6-ceramide, C6-Cer) orN-hexanoyl-d-dihydrosphingosine (Matreya, Pleasant Gap, PA) dissolved in ethanol, bSMase (Sigma) dissolved in 20 mm Hepes pH 7.4, or NGF (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel). Apoptotic neurons were visualized by fluorescence microscopy after cells were labeled with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (0.5 μg/ml; Sigma) as described (6Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 14Schwarz A. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2929-2938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclei of apoptotic cells exhibit condensed chromatin. Live and dead cells were distinguished using 2 μm calcein acetoxymethyl ester and 4 μm ethidium homodimer-1, respectively, as described in a Live/Dead®viability/cytotoxicity kit (Molecular Probes Inc.). At least 700–800 cells were counted per coverslip. Neurons were examined using a Plan 25×/0.45 numerical aperture objective of a Zeiss Axiovert 35 microscope, and data are expressed as percent of dead neurons. Neuronal viability was also quantified using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) (20Ambrosio A.F. Silva A.P. Malva J.O. Mesquita J.F. Carvalho A.P. Carvalho C.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2000; 12: 2021-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Neurons plated at high density were treated as described above and subsequently placed in 35-mm dishes containing B27-supplemented neurobasal medium with 1 mg/ml MTT for 3 h at 37 °C; the precipitated dye was dissolved in 0.04m HCl in isopropyl alcohol. Viability was assessed by spectrophotometrical analysis at 570 nm. The 17-amino acid peptide, SCNSGTSYNSISSVVSR, corresponding to the C-terminal domain of DAP kinase, and its scrambled analog, SCSRSVGSNSYTVNIS, were prepared on a Wang-resin (Nova Biochem, Laeufelingen, Switzerland) with an automated multiple peptide synthesizer (Abimed, model AMS422, Langenfeld, Germany), using the company's protocol for the Fmoc (N-α-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) strategy. For purity determination of products, analytical reverse-phase HPLC was performed by using a prepacked Lichrosphere-100 RP-18 column (Merck). The correct amino acid compositions and molecular weights of the crude products (purity ≥ 88%) were ascertained by amino acid analysis and by mass spectrometry (VG Tofspec, laser desorption mass spectrometer, Fision Instruments). Fluorescent labeling was performed on part of the resin-bound peptides by reacting the free N-terminal α-amino group of serine with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate (Sigma), inN′,N′-dimethylformamide, in the presence of diisopropylethylamine, for 20 h at room temperature. Following removal from the resin, the violet-red products were shown by analytical HPLC to be more hydrophobic than their parent peptides. Both HPLC and mass spectrometry revealed that the labeling was not complete. The intracellular localization of the peptide was determined using a Plan Apochromat 63×/1.4 oil objective of a Zeiss Axiovert 35 microscope with an appropriate filter for rhodamine fluorescence and photographed using a Contax 167MT camera and Kodak Tmax p3200 film. Hippocampal neurons and brain tissue were extracted in lysis buffer and immunoblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes as described (6Cohen O. Feinstein E. Kimchi A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 998-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with anti-DAP kinase monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) diluted 1:1000 or anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibodies (Sigma) diluted 1:5000 and then with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Laboratories). Antibodies were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Supersignal, Pierce). We previously demonstrated that high concentrations of C6-Cer induce cell death in cultured hippocampal neurons via an apoptotic mechanism (14Schwarz A. Futerman A.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2929-2938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inasmuch as nuclear condensation and annexin binding were observed, followed by retraction of axons and dendrites and detachment of neurons from the coverslips. In the current study, similar pro-apoptotic effects of C6-Cer were observed on both rat and mouse neurons (not shown). To determine whether DAP-kinase is involved in mediating these effects, neurons were incubated with C6-Cer for various times. DAP kinase expression increased significantly 1 h after treatment and was elevated 2–3-fold after 4 h, remaining at similar levels for up to 8 h (Fig. 1), times which significantly preceded the appearance of apoptotic neurons. This suggests that DAP kinase activation may play a causal role in the onset of apoptosis in neurons. To determine the role that DAP kinase plays in ceramide-induced neuronal death, primary hippocampal neurons were cultured from DAP kinase null mice. These mice are homozygous for a targeted inactivating mutation in the DAP kinase gene and hence fail to express DAP kinase (Fig. 2A). When co-cultured with a glia monolayer (see “Experimental Procedures”; note that the glia monolayer was physically separated from the neurons) and analyzed after 16 h of treatment with 15 μm C6-Cer, DAP kinase−/− neurons were resistant to C6-Cer-induced apoptotic death compared with wild type neurons, in which ∼70% apoptotic neurons were observed at this time point (Fig. 2B). DAP kinase−/− neurons cultured in B27- supplemented neurobasal medium in the absence of a glial monolayer were also significantly more resistant to C6-Cer-induced apoptotic death. However, at the highest concentrations of C6-Cer tested (15 μm; Fig. 3A), a small but significant increase in cell death was also observed in DAP kinase−/− neurons after 16–22 h, although far less pronounced than in wild type neurons (Fig. 3A). At longer time points (i.e. after 48 h of treatment with C6-Cer), no difference could be detected between wild type and DAP kinase−/− neurons (Fig. 3B), and both were susceptible to C6-Cer-induced cell death. The biologically inactive C6-dihydroceramide (15 μm) did not induce death even after 48 h (Fig. 3B). We have recently shown that application of high concentrations of NGF to hippocampal neurons that express sufficiently high levels of the p75 neurotrophin receptor results in endogenous ceramide generation and neuronal cell death.2 Application of 500 ng/ml NGF to wild type mouse neurons causes apoptotic cell death as detected by chromatin condensation (Fig. 4, A–D) whereas no chromatin condensation could be detected in neurons from DAP kinase−/− mice (Fig. 4, E–H). Quantification of the extent of apoptosis revealed that DAP kinase−/− neurons were resistant to NGF-induced cell death after 24 h, whereas wild type neurons were susceptible (Fig.5A). The extent of cell death was also analyzed by measuring neuronal viability. A significant loss of viability was observed in wild type neurons after treatment with both NGF (500 ng/ml) and C6-Cer (10 μm), but only a small decrease in viability was observed in DAP kinase−/− neurons (Fig. 5B).Figure 5DAPK−/− neurons are resistant to NGF-induced apoptosis. Neurons from wild type or DAPK−/− mice were cultured in neurobasal medium for 4 days. A, neurons were incubated with 500 ng/ml NGF (hatched bars) or vehicle control (black bars) for 24 h. Cell death was quantified using the Live/Dead® kit. Results are means ± S.D. for 4 coverslips per treatment. B, neurons plated at high density were incubated with 500 ng/ml NGF (hatched bars), 10 μm C6-Cer (gray bars), or vehicle control (black bars) for 24 h. Cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay and expressed as percent viable untreated cells. Results are means ± S.D. for 4–10 coverslips per treatment from 3 separate neuronal cultures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously shown that ectopic expression of a cDNA fragment encoding the 17-amino acid tail derived from the C terminus of DAP kinase is the shortest fragment that inhibits the pro-apoptotic functions of DAP kinase (9Raveh T. Berissi H. Eisenstein M. Spivak T. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1572-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To determine the possible role of this C-terminal fragment in ceramide-induced neuronal death, a fluorescent derivative of the peptide was synthesized. This peptide, SCNSGTSYNSISSVVSR, consisting of mainly polar, uncharged amino acids and lacking charged residues, was covalently attached to tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate to increase its hydrophobicity. The rhodamine-peptide was internalized into neurons, albeit by an unknown mechanism, and could be detected at high levels in the cytosol as early as 1 h after addition, remaining at high levels for at least 16 h (Fig. 6,A and B). Neurons treated with the peptide were resistant to the apoptotic effects of either C6-Cer or of exogenously added neutral bacterial bSMase (Fig.7). In contrast, a peptide with the same amino acid composition, but whose sequence was scrambled, did not block ceramide- or bSMase-induced apoptosis (Fig. 7), even though it was internalized to a similar extent (Fig. 6, C andD).Figure 7Inhibitory effect of the C-terminal peptide on neuronal death. Rat neurons, co-cultured with glia for 4 days, were incubated with C6-Cer (15 μm, 16 h) or with bSMase (120 milliunits/ml, 16 h), 1 h after incubation with the rhodamine-conjugated peptide or scrambled peptide (30 μm).

Yankner B.A. Nature. 2000; 407: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1608) Google Scholar). Thus, in the developing nervous system, neuronal maturation is accompanied by exit from the mitotic cell cycle, differentiation, and death of approximately half of the cells produced during neurogenesis. Later in life, mature neurons can undergo apoptotic cell death in response to a variety of stress conditions, including lack of neurotrophic factors, anoxia, excitotoxicity, traumatic injury, or neurodegenerative disorders. In the current study, we demonstrate that DAP kinase, a general mediator of cell death that is expressed at high levels in the developing and mature nervous system, plays an important role in mediating neuronal cell death induced by ceramide. This was demonstrated by two complementary approaches, namely analysis of death in neurons cultured from a DAP kinase-deficient mouse and by the use of a C-terminal peptide that inhibits the pro-apoptotic functions of DAP kinase. A central role for DAP kinase is also suggested by the observation that DAP kinase levels are elevated in response to ceramide. The biological relevance of our findings is underlined by the involvement of DAP kinase in NGF-induced neuronal death via the p75 neurotrophin receptor. Although there is some dispute about the precise role of ceramide in triggering apoptosis, large amounts of evidence have accumulated over the past decade supporting the idea that ceramide, generated either by the activation of sphingomyelinase(s) or by de novo synthesis, is a bona fide second messenger, the levels of which can be modulated by a variety of external signals (11Kolesnick R.N. Kronke M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 12Hannun Y.A. Luberto C.

Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 408-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In our study, ceramide induces DAP kinase expression by an as yet unknown mechanism, although we do not know whether the increased expression is the main reason for DAP kinase activation in dying neurons. Likewise, the downstream effectors of DAP kinase, including its direct substrates, are not known, and this issue is being actively pursued in our laboratories. The lack of complete resistance to ceramide-induced cell death in DAP kinase−/− neurons suggests that although DAP kinase is a central player in ceramide-induced cell death, the pathway in which DAP kinase is involved is not the only one by which ceramide can induce apoptosis. Thus, there could be several pathways of signaling originating from ceramide generation that are activated either by different upstream effectors or at different times or at different intracellular locations. However, we can exclude the possibility that membrane integrity is disrupted by high concentrations of C6-Cer after long times as C6-dihydroceramide had no effect at similar concentrations and after similar times of incubation. Finally, an important aspect of this study relates to the development of a specific peptide inhibitor, which is internalized by neurons, accumulates within cells, and subsequently efficiently blocks apoptosis. The mechanism of internalization of this peptide is not known, but its cytosolic distribution suggests that it is not internalized by a facilitated mechanism, such as fluid-phase endocytosis, but rather by nonspecific transport across the cell membrane. This peptide inhibitor is being further used to study the function of DAP kinase in apoptosis in other systems and may serve as a starting point to further develop pharmaceutical anti-apoptotic drugs consisting of short, functionally active peptide derivatives and/or of peptide mimetics to modulate apoptotic processes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2137909108,"Oxidative stress is believed to be an important factor in the development of age-related diseases, and studies in lower organisms have established links between oxidative stress tolerance and longevity. We have hypothesized that aging is associated with a reduced ability to mount acute host defenses to oxidant injury, which increases the vulnerability of aged cells to stress. We tested this hypothesis by using primary hepatocytes from young (4-6 months) and aged (24-26 months) rats. Old hepatocytes were more sensitive to H2O2-induced apoptosis than were young cells. Lower survival is associated with reduced activations of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt kinase, both of which protect against oxidant injury. That reduced ERK and Akt activities contribute to lower survival of aged cells was supported by additional findings. First, pharmacologic inhibition of ERK and Akt activation in young cells markedly increased their sensitivity to H2O2. Second, caloric restriction, which increases rodent life span and delays the onset of many age-related declines in physiologic function, prevented loss in ERK and Akt activation by H2O2 and enhanced survival of old hepatocytes to levels similar to those of young cells. Strategies aimed at boosting these host responses to acute oxidant injury could have significant anti-aging benefits."
https://openalex.org/W2044200046,"Neuronal death induced by a variety of means requires participation of the E2F family of transcription factors. Here, we show that E2F acts as a gene silencer in neurons and that repression of E2F-responsive genes is required for neuronal survival. Moreover, neuronal death evoked by DNA damaging agents or trophic factor withdrawal is characterized by derepression of E2F-responsive genes. Such derepression, rather than direct E2F-promoted gene activation, is required for death. Among the genes that are derepressed in neurons subjected to DNA damage or trophic factor withdrawal are the transcription factors B- and C-myb. Overexpression of B- and C-myb is sufficient to evoke neuronal death. These findings support a model in which E2F-dependent gene repression and derepression play pivotal roles in neuronal survival and death, respectively."

We identify senseless repression of rough in R8 as an essential mechanism of R8 cell fate determination and demonstrate that misexpression of senseless in non-R8 photoreceptors results in repression of rough and induction of the R8 fate. Surprisingly, there is no loss of ommatidial clusters in senseless mutant tissue and all outer photoreceptor subtypes can be recruited, suggesting that other photoreceptors can substitute for R8 to initiate recruitment and that R8-specific signaling is not required for outer photoreceptor subtype assignment. A genetic model of R8 differentiation is presented."
https://openalex.org/W2026162932,"Androgen deprivation therapy for advanced prostate cancer is often effective, but not curative. Molecular pathways mediating the therapeutic response and those contributing to the subsequent hormone-refractory cell growth remain poorly understood. Here, cDNA microarray analysis of human CWR22 prostate cancer xenografts during the course of androgen deprivation therapy revealed distinct global gene expression profiles in primary, regressing and recurrent tumors. Elucidation of the genes involved in the transition between these states implicated specific molecular mechanisms in therapy failure and tumor progression. First, we identified a set of androgen-responsive genes whose expression decreased during the therapy response, but was then systematically restored in the recurrent tumors. In addition, altered expression of genes that encode known targets of rapamycin or that converge on the PI3K/AKT/FRAP pathway was observed in the recurrent tumors. Further suggestion for the involvement of these genes in hormone-refractory prostate cancer came from the observation that cells established from the recurrent xenografts were strongly inhibited in vitro by rapamycin. The results of this functional genomic analysis suggest that the combined effect of re-expression of androgen-responsive genes as well as the activation of rapamycin-sensitive signaling may drive prostate cancer progression, and contribute to the failure of androgen-deprivation therapy."

Regulation of gap junctional intercellular communication may influence heart function and its response to cardiac injury. In this study, we examined the effects of ET-1 and AT-II on connexin43 (Cx43) and connexin40 (Cx40) in cultured neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRCs) and the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling in the ET-1- and AT-II-induced responses. NRCs were incubated for 24 h with either ET-1 or AT-II (each at concentrations ranging from 10 to 1000 nM), and Cx43 expression and phosphorylation increased with increasing concentrations of both. ET-1 effects were significantly blocked by ETA (BQ123), but not by ETB (BQ788), receptor antagonists. AT-II-induced Cx43 induction could be completely inhibited by the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan. In contrast to Cx43, Cx40 expression did not change in either ET-1- or in AT-II-treated NRCs. Thus, these two connexins were differentially regulated. ET-1 and AT-II increased the gap junctional conductance between the cardiomyocytes in culture as measured using a dual-cell voltage clamp. Mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibition revealed that ERK1/2 was critical for up-regulation of Cx43 in response to ET-1, whereas both ERK and p38 signal pathways were involved in the regulation of Cx43 by AT-II. Thus, stimulation of the ERK and p38 signal pathways via ETA and AT1 receptors may partcipate in the regulation of cardiac gap junctions under (patho)physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2164814468,"Astrocyte motility plays an important role in the response of the brain to injury and during regeneration. We used two in vitro assays, a wound-healing model and a chemotaxis assay, to study mechanisms that control astrocyte motility. Ryanodine receptors (RyR), intracellular calcium-release channels, modulate intracellular Ca2+ levels, and also motility: 1) blocking RyR with antagonizing concentration of ryanodine (200 microM) strongly attenuated motility and 2) motility of astrocytes cultured from homozygous RyR type 3 knockout mice was impaired strongly compared with wild-type. In contrast, MIP-1a-induced chemotaxis was neither impaired in the presence of ryanodine nor in the cells from the knockout animals. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis combined with Western blotting and immunocytochemistry confirmed the expression of RyR type 3, but not type 1 or 2 in cultured and acutely isolated astrocytes. RyR in astrocytes are linked to Ca2+ signaling because the RyR agonist 4-chloro-m-cresol induced a release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. These results indicate that astrocytes express only RyR type 3 and that this receptor is important for controlling astrocyte motility."

Targets of GSK-3 include proteins involved in transcription, translation, the control of the cytoskeleton, cell cycle, and glycogen metabolism. Phosphorylation by GSK-3 is often inhibitory. For example, GSK-3 phosphorylation inhibits glycogen synthase activity. Insulin stimulation reduces GSK-3 activity and hence increases the conversion of glucose to glycogen (1Plyte S.E. Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Pulverer B.J. Woodgett J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1114: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). GSK-3 phosphorylation also targets β-catenin for degradation. This is inhibited by Wnt stimulation, and the increased concentrations of β-catenin bind and activate members of the TCF transcription factor family (3Cohen P. Parker P.J. Woodgett J.R. Czech M.P.

In animals, most studies have shown the activity of GSK-3 to be negatively regulated by ligands such as epidermal growth factor, Wnt, and insulin. InDictyostelium, genetic and biochemical evidence showed both positive and negative regulation of GSK-3 activity (7Ginsburg G.T. Kimmel A.R.

Insulin signaling is the best characterized signaling pathway. Here, GSK-3 kinase activity is inhibited through phosphorylation of an inhibitory amino-terminal serine (Ser-21 in GSK-3α and Ser-9 in GSK-3β) by protein kinase B/Akt (9Cross D.A.E. Alessi D.R.

Wnt signal transduction interferes with the function of this complex, leading to the stabilization of β-catenin and the activation of β-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription. Other proteins that have been suggested to bind GSK-3 directly include Frat/GBP, presenilin, and Muc1 (21Yost C. Farr III, G.H. Pierce S.B. Ferkey D.M. Mingzi Chen M. Kimelman D.

Frat competes with Axin for binding to GSK-3 and also interacts with the upstream Wnt signaling component Dishevelled, leading to the suggestion that it titrates GSK-3 from Axin in response to Wnt signaling (24Li L.

We use the crystal structural data to generate a library of surface scanning mutants. From this library, we have identified four mutants that interact with only Axin or Frat but not both. This argues that although binding of Axin and Frat to GSK-3 may be mutually exclusive, they do not bind through an identical interaction site. To assess the importance of the Axin binding, we examine non-Axin binding GSK-3 mutants in the context of a number of organisms. As expected, Axin binding is required for the effects of dominant negative GSK-3 on patterning in Xenopusembryos. The Axin binding site motif is conserved in all GSK-3 kinase family members, and we show that it is required for GSK-3 function in the nonmetazoan, Dictyostelium. Finally, we show that Axin binding is not the only interaction able to regulate TCF-dependent gene expression. His-tagged GSK-3β was purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells as described in Ref. 10Dajani R. Fraser E. Roe S.M. Young N. Good V. Dale T.C. Pearl L.H.

GSK-3, ATP (2 mm final concentration), the cross-linking reagent dimethyl suberimidate (DMS; 50 mmstock solution), FRATtide, and AxinGID were diluted in reaction buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) and made up to a total volume of 40 μl. DMS was added to the mixture at 30-fold molar excess over the primary amine content of the GSK-3. The reactions were incubated at 4 °C for 90 min. and stopped by the addition of 25 mmTris, pH 6.8, and SDS loading buffer. The mixtures were analyzed on 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE gels and stained with Coomassie Blue. [35S]Methionine-labeled GSK-3 proteins (wild type and mutant) were made using the TNT-coupledin vitro transcription/translation system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). 5 μl of each mix was removed and mixed with 20 μl of loading buffer to check the efficiency of the reaction. The remainder was split in half and mixed with purified GST fusion protein and 25 μl of washed glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This was made up to 250 μl with ice-cold buffer (100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA supplemented with a Complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol).

The activities of mutant GSK-3 proteins were expressed as a percentage of transfected wild type GSK-3. HEK 293 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2.

Primary antibodies used were mouse anti-GSK-3β and mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories). 293 cells were seeded at 7.5 × 105 cells/10-cm dish 48 h before an experiment.

Samples were loaded on 10 or 12% SDS-PAGE gels, blotted, and subjected to Western analysis. Cells were seeded at 30–40% confluence and were transfected with the specified vectors using Effectene Reagent (Qiagen, Crawley, West Sussex, UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

HA epitope was detected with the rat monoclonal antibody 3F10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). FLAG epitope was detected with the mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma). Quantitation of expression was carried out by taking thin optical slices of transfected cells by confocal microscopy. Optical sections were selected to intersect the center of the nucleus and were quantified by density analysis using the Bio-Rad Confocal Software line intensity tool. After linearization with NotI, the mRNA expression vectors for XGSK-3 were transcribed in vitro using SP6 polymerase (Promega) in the presence RNA cap analog (New England Biolabs). The vegetal poles of single ventral blastomeres of four-cell embryos were injected with 2.5 ng of the indicated mRNA transcript and allowed to develop for 3 days. XGSK-3 parental constructs were described by Pierce and Kimelman (29Pierce S.B. Kimelman D. Development. 1995; 121: 755-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were provided by Dr. P. Klein. Mutant GSK-3 constructs were generated using site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's instructions (QuikChange; Stratagene). Surface scanning mutagenesis was performed on HA-tagged GSK-3 cDNAs within the pcDNA3.1+ expression vector. The GR mutation was introduced into XGSK-3 plasmids in a pCS2+ vector background for theXenopus studies (29Pierce S.B. Kimelman D. Development. 1995; 121: 755-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GR substitution was introduced into GskA in the plasmid pDXA-gskA (8Plyte S.E. O'Donovan E. Woodgett J.R. Harwood A.J. Development. 1999; 126: 325-333PubMed Google Scholar), which expresses thegskA cDNA from the actin15 promoter. The K208A/E209Q substitution in the GSK-3 binding domain of Frat was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the FLAG-tagged cDNA within the pcDNA3.1+ expression vector. β-Catenin-GFP expression constructs were made by fusing GFP to the C terminus of murine β-catenin in the pEGFP vector (CLONTECH). Wild type andgskA mutant cells were grown at 22 °C in axenic medium pH 6.4. Cells were transformed by electroporation (54Howard P.K. Ahern K.G. Firtel R.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 2613-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cells were observed either on SM agar or growing in axenic medium. For suspension development, cells were washed in KK2 (15.5 mmKH2PO4, 3.8 mmK2HPO4, pH 6.2) and shaken for 8 h in KK2. 1 mm cAMP was added, and cells were shaken further for 16 h (35Grimson M.J. Coates J.C. Reynolds J.P. Shipman M. Blanton R.L. Harwood A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 727-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In previous work, we determined the structure of human GSK-3β and showed that it formed an intimate head-to-tail dimer (10Dajani R. Fraser E. Roe S.M. Young N. Good V. Dale T.C. Pearl L.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). Since apparent dimers in protein crystals may be artifacts of the crystal lattice, we sought to determine whether GSK-3 formed a stable dimer in solution using chemical cross-linking. We found that GSK-3 formed dimers at a concentration of the dimethyl suberimidate cross-linking reagent that was previously used to identify intimate dimers of the hsp90 protein (26Prodromou C. Panaretou B. Chohan S. Siligardi G. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Roe S.M. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4383-4392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Higher molecular weight ladders of cross-linked product were not detected, suggesting that the cross-linking reaction was specifically linking soluble dimers. When GSK-3 was titrated from 10 to 1.25 μm, the ratio of dimer to unlinked product was reduced, suggesting that the affinity of GSK-3 for itself was in the low micromolar range (Fig.1A). To confirm this observation, we attempted to co-precipitate in vitrotranslated GSK-3 with His-tagged GSK-3 at a final concentration of 230 nm. Although His-tagged GSK-3 was able to associate with Frat, it was unable to associate with itself, suggesting that the affinity of GSK-3 dimer formation is significantly less than that of the GSK-3-Frat interaction (Fig. 1B). In the cross-linking assays, we observed the formation of heteromeric complexes between GSK-3 and GSK-3-binding peptides from Frat (FRATtide) (31Thomas G.M. Frame S. Goedert M. Nathke I. Polakis P. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and Axin (AxinGID) of 38 and 59 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 1,C and D). The addition of AxinGID and FRATtide strongly interfered with GSK-3-GSK-3 cross-linking, suggesting that Frat and Axin either bind to the dimer interface or allosterically alter the ability of GSK-3 to self-associate. Maximal inhibition of GSK-3-GSK-3 dimer formation was obtained at ∼1:1 molar ratios of Frat or Axin to GSK-3. The ability of the AxinGID to self-associate was investigated, since previous studies showed that full-length Axin formed multimers. Under conditions in which GST-Axin was able to associate with in vitro translated GSK-3, GST-Axin did not associate with in vitro translated Axin (Fig. 1E). The further addition of purified GSK-3 to the Axin in vitro translation mix failed to generate Axin/GST-Axin interactions, suggesting that Axin dimerization was not required for GSK-3 binding. CD spectroscopy studies of purified AxinGID indicated that this region had no structure. 2R. Dajani, unpublished observation. To identify sites on GSK-3 that mediate interactions with Axin and Frat, we generated a series of 79 point mutations predominantly at the surface of the molecule. The GSK-3 point mutants were initially screened for binding using GST-Axin and GST-Frat in a precipitation assay in vitro (Fig.2A). Mutational changes were engineered to alter the surface charge, or hydrophobicity. Most mutants bound with similar efficiency to both Axin and Frat. 60% (48/79 mutations) bound at levels indistinguishable from the wild type protein, whereas the remaining mutants showed reduced binding ranging from 0 to 75% efficiency when expressed as a percentage of the wild type (Table I; Fig. 2, B–D). The nature of the amino acid substitution was a major contributor to the level of binding. For example, V139I bound GST-AxinGID and GST-Frat with close to wild type efficiency, while V139D bound with only 5 and 10% efficiencies, respectively. Similarly, a change of serine 237 to an aspartic acid residue (S237D) partially interfered with both Axin and Frat binding, while mutation of the same residue to alanine (S237A) failed to alter binding.Table ISummary of GSK-3 mutant studiesLittle effect on bindingAA1-aAA, amino acid.

Open table in a new tab Residue Lys85, which forms part of the ATP binding site and is commonly mutated to generate kinase-dead variants, was changed to either a methionine or an arginine (27He X.

The K85M mutant showed negligible binding to Frat and Axin. Since Lys85 is not readily accessible, it is unlikely to be directly involved in binding to regulatory proteins, and the failure of binding is probably due to the disruption of the correct folding of GSK-3. By contrast, when Lys85 was mutated to an arginine (K85R), the mutant bound with wild type efficiency to both Axin and Frat (Fig. 2A). Although the K85R mutation also generates a kinase-dead variant of GSK-3, it is a more conservative change and preserves Axin and Frat binding. This observation contradicts previous studies that suggested that GSK-3 kinase activity was required for Axin binding (30Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Kinase activity does not correlate with binding, but it may provide an independent readout for the correct folding of the molecule. We characterized the activity of several mutants using transfection-based immunoprecipitation kinase assays (Table I). Due to variable levels of expression, the activity of many mutants was difficult to assess. Among those characterized, we found that L343R, which failed to bind Axin or Frat, was kinase-inactive. Leu343 was not present on the surface and may, like K85M, have disrupted the overall structure (Fig.2, B–D). Four mutants showed differential binding to Axin and Frat (Table I). Three of these differentially interfered with Axin binding (V267G/E268R, F293Q, and E312K), while one differentially interfered with Frat binding (R180E). Interestingly, R180E is one of three residues (Arg96, Arg180, and Lys205) that are involved in the recognition of the prephosphorylated serine/threonine in GSK-3-dependent targets ((S/T)XXX(pS/pT); where pS and pT represent phosphoserine and phosphotyrosine, respectively) (10Dajani R. Fraser E. Roe S.M. Young N. Good V. Dale T.C. Pearl L.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). By contrast, mutation of Arg96 and Lys205 had no effect on Axin or Frat binding. With the exception of Glu312, all of the residues that differentially affected binding clustered on the GSK-3 dimer interface (Fig. 2, B–D). This supports the suggestion that binding of Frat and Axin sterically interferes with GSK-3 dimer formation. The binding of both to the same face of GSK-3 is consistent with the finding that Axin and Frat binding to GSK-3 are mutually exclusive (31Thomas G.M. Frame S. Goedert M. Nathke I. Polakis P. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The strongest differential binding observed was with the mutant GSK-3 V267G/E268R (GSK-3GR), which bound Frat efficiently but had severely reduced binding to GST-AxinGID. We chose to study the GSK-3GR further because it was kinase-active and localized close to a further differential “Frat > Axin” binding mutant (F293Q) in the crystal structure (Table I; Fig. 2C). GSK-3GR was purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells and assayed in parallel with wild type GSK-3. At similar concentrations to wild type GSK-3, GSK-3GR formed cross-linked homodimers and interacted with both Axin and Frat. In pull-down assays at lower concentrations (45 nm), the selective binding of GSK-3GR was revealed when it precipi"
https://openalex.org/W2119421056,"Human gliomas are highly invasive, and remain to be a major obstacle for any effective therapeutic remedy. Among many other factors, gliomas express elevated levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which have been implicated to play an important role in tumor invasion as well as neovascularization. The tumor suppressor gene mutated in multiple advanced cancers/phosphatase and tensin homologue (MMAC/PTEN) has been shown to inhibit cell migration, spreading, and focal adhesion. In this study, we determined whether MMAC/PTEN inhibits tumor invasion by modulating MMP-2 activity. Our results showed that reintroduction of the MMAC/PTEN gene into human glioma U251 and U87 cells modified their phenotype and growth characteristics. The ability of MMAC/PTEN to induce anoikis in U251 cells was accompanied by a significant inhibition of in vitro invasion (70%). Expression of MMAC/PTEN in U251 and U87 cells inhibited MMP-2 enzymatic activity as determined by zymography. Furthermore, MMAC/PTEN expression strongly decreased MMP-2 mRNA levels, which correlated well with the inhibition of invasion capacity in these cells. Concomitant with MMP-2 expression and activity, MMP-2 promoter activity was also reduced in MMAC/PTEN expressing cells. Our observations suggest that MMAC/PTEN inhibits tumor cell invasion in part by regulating MMP-2 gene transcription and thereby its enzymatic activity. Further characterization of this regulation will facilitate the development of MMAC/PTEN based gene therapy for gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W1489665957,"The relationship between selenium and signal molecules has not been well elucidated. It was found that physiological concentration of selenite, 3 microM, reduced ASK1 activity and induced PI3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt pathways in HT1080 cells. Duration of these signal molecules by selenite was much longer than that by growth factors and other stresses. The longer duration time of these signal molecules may be important to maintain normal functions against stresses. Selenite increased cell proliferation through up-regulation of Bcl-2 expression, mitochondrial membrane potential, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation, and glucose uptake mediated by PI3-K pathway. High concentration of H2O2 increased an apoptotic signal molecule, ASK1, which resulted in Bcl-2 down-regulation, membrane potential disruption, decreased ATP and glucose uptake, and activation of caspases. However, an antiapoptotic signal molecule, Akt, was activated also by H2O2, but duration of its activation was much shorter. Selenite blocked apoptosis induced by H2O2, which was related to blocking ASK1 and further stimulating PI3-kinase/Akt activities. Selenite blocked mitochondrial membrane potential disruption by 400 mM H2O2. Selenite also blocked caspase-9 and -3 activities and apoptosis induced by 500 microM H2O2, even after mitochondrial membrane potential disruption. These observations demonstrate that selenite increases cell proliferation and maintains cell survival by activating the antiapoptotic signal and blocking the apoptotic signal."
https://openalex.org/W2094380375,"In the spinal cord dorsal horn, excitatory sensory fibers terminate adjacent to interneuron terminals. Here, we show that kainate (KA) receptor activation triggered action potential-independent release of GABA and glycine from dorsal horn interneurons. This release was transient, because KA receptors desensitized, and it required Na+ entry and Ca2+ channel activation. KA modulated evoked inhibitory transmission in a dose-dependent, biphasic manner, with suppression being more prominent. In recordings from isolated neuron pairs, this suppression required GABA(B) receptor activation, suggesting that KA-triggered GABA release activated presynaptic GABA(B) autoreceptors. Finally, glutamate released from sensory fibers caused a KA and GABA(B) receptor-dependent suppression of inhibitory transmission in spinal slices. Thus, we show how presynaptic KA receptors are linked to changes in GABA/glycine release and highlight a novel role for these receptors in regulating sensory transmission."

It has been shown recently that topo I rapidly moves out of the nucleolus (nucleolar delocalization) in response to topo I inhibitors. In the present study, we demonstrated that nucleolar delocalization of topo I is associated with its conjugation by SUMOs (small ubiquitin-like modifiers) in response to the topo I inhibitor topotecan. Time-course experiments revealed that SUMO-topo I conjugation occurred at as early as 5 min after drug treatment, which was earlier than its observed nucleolar delocalization. Furthermore, heat shock blocked sumoylation of topo I; it also blocked the nucleolar delocalization of topo I fusion proteins. UBC9 is an E2 (ubiquitin carrier protein)-conjugating enzyme essential for sumoylation. Although overexpression of wild-type UBC9 enhanced both sumoylation and nuclear delocalization of topo I, overexpression of a UBC9 dominant negative mutant attenuated topo I sumoylation and its nucleolar delocalization. Taken together, our results suggest that sumoylation of topo I might serve as an addressing tag for its nucleolar delocalization in response to topo I inhibitors.

Taken together, our results suggest that sumoylation of topo I might serve as an addressing tag for its nucleolar delocalization in response to topo I inhibitors. topoisomerase I dominant negative enhanced green fluorescent protein promyelocytic leukemia protein topotecan ubiquitin carrier protein Me2SO DNA topoisomerase I (topo I)1 is a nuclear enzyme that plays an important role in relieving the torsional strains of DNA resulting from transcription and replication (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). Moreover, the enzyme is a target for such anticancer agents as camptothecin and its clinically important derivatives topotecan (TPT) and irinotecan. Camptothecin drugs are believed to interact with the enzyme to stabilize transient covalent enzyme-DNA complexes (2Li T.K. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 53-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). After treatment of cells with these agents, single-strand DNA breaks are formed initially, and they are converted to double-strand breaks during DNA replication, which are the lethal signals leading to cell death through apoptosis (2Li T.K. Liu L.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 53-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Mammalian topo I consists of three functionally distinct domains; they are the N-terminal, core, and catalytic C-terminal domains (3D'Arpa P. Machlin P.S. Ratrie III, H. Rothfield N.F. Cleveland D.W. Earnshaw W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2543-2547Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 4Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7602-7608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Although the N-terminal domain is not required for the catalytic activity of the enzyme, it is essential for topo I to function in vivo (5Alsner J. Svejstrup J.Q. Kjeldsen E. Sorensen B.S. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12408-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) because some critical nuclear/nucleolar localization signals reside in this region (5Alsner J. Svejstrup J.Q. Kjeldsen E. Sorensen B.S. Westergaard O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12408-12411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a nuclear protein, topo I is concentrated in the nucleolus, a site of rRNA synthesis (6Muller M.T. Pfund W.P Mehta V.B. Trask D.K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1237-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We have shown that amino acids 188–198 at the N terminus of human topo I are important for its nucleolar localization (7Mo Y-Y. Wang C. Beck W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41107-41113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, the nucleolar distribution of topo I is dynamic because the nucleolus is a non-membrane structure (8Lamond A.I. Earnshaw W.C. Science. 1988; 280: 547-553Crossref Scopus (782) Google Scholar), and its formation is dependent upon cell growth (8Lamond A.I. Earnshaw W.C. Science. 1988; 280: 547-553Crossref Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 9Baker S.D. Wadkins R.M. Stewart C.F. Beck W.T. Danks M.K. Cytometry. 1995; 19: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For instance, topo I tends to accumulate in the nucleolus of proliferating cells, whereas in leucine-deprived cells, it does not (9Baker S.D. Wadkins R.M. Stewart C.F. Beck W.T. Danks M.K. Cytometry. 1995; 19: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Because the nucleolus is a site for rRNA biogenesis, there appears to be a correlation between the nucleolar accumulation of topo I and the activity of rRNA synthesis. Furthermore, the notion of this dynamic change of nucleolar distribution of topo I is also supported by the findings that some cytotoxic agents can cause redistribution of topo I in the nucleus (10Danks M.K. Garrett K.E. Marion R.C. Whipple D.O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1664-1673PubMed Google Scholar, 11Buckwalter C.A. Lin A.H. Tanizawa A. Pommier Y.G. Cheng Y.C. Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1674-1681PubMed Google Scholar). Upon treatment with topo I inhibitors or other RNA synthesis inhibitors, topo I has been shown to move out of the nucleolus rapidly (nucleolar delocalization), similar to what has been seen for other nucleolar proteins such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and B23 in response to RNA synthesis inhibitors (11Buckwalter C.A. Lin A.H. Tanizawa A. Pommier Y.G. Cheng Y.C. Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1674-1681PubMed Google Scholar, 12Desnoyers S. Kaufmann S.H. Poirier G.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 146-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although it has been suggested that this nucleolar delocalization might be related to reduced activity of rRNA biosynthesis in the nucleolus (11Buckwalter C.A. Lin A.H. Tanizawa A. Pommier Y.G. Cheng Y.C. Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1674-1681PubMed Google Scholar), the molecular event(s) that leads to nucleolar delocalization of topo I is not clear. SUMOs are small ubiquitin-likemodifiers that have been shown to form conjugates with the targeted proteins (13Lee G.W. Melchior F. Matunis M.J. Mahajan R. Tian Q. Anderson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6503-6507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 14Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), a process that is known as sumoylation. UBC9 is an E2 enzyme that has been shown to be essential for sumoylation. Like ubiquitin, SUMOs form a covalent bond at a lysine residue. However, unlike ubiquitination, which leads to degradation of conjugated proteins, sumoylation seems to stabilize the targeted proteins (16Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 17Buschmann T. Fuchs S.Y. Lee C.G. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Cell. 2000; 101: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Because the early finding that the RanGAP1, which interacts with nuclear pore complexes, is sumoylated (13Lee G.W. Melchior F. Matunis M.J. Mahajan R. Tian Q. Anderson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6503-6507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), a large number of nuclear proteins have been shown to be sumoylated (18Gostissa M. Hengstermann A.

Nandi S. Nucifora G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13281-13285Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Although the role of sumoylation is not fully understood, two functions for sumoylation have been suggested; they are 1) competing with ubiquitination for protein degradation and 2) serving as an addressing tag to target proteins such that it modulates their functions or activities (25Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Of interest, topo I has been shown recently to be sumoylated in response to topo I inhibitors, and it has been proposed that sumoylation of topo I is a possible rescuing mechanism from DNA damage (26Mao Y. Sun M. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4046-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether sumoylation of topo I has any impact on its subnuclear distribution. Accordingly, in the present study, we examined the relationship between sumoylation of topo I and its nucleolar delocalization. Our results suggest that sumoylation of topo I might serve as addressing tag for its nucleolar delocalization. HeLa cells were obtained from American Type Cell Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). CEM and CEM/B1 and CEM/VM1–5 cells were grown in Spinner's minimal essential medium (BioWhittaker) as described previously (27Mo Y-Y. Wang P. Beck W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin/ml, and 100 μg of streptomycin/ml. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified chamber supplemented with 5% CO2. Plasmids carrying the EGFP-topo I gene were introduced into HeLa cells by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (27Mo Y-Y. Wang P. Beck W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Transiently transfected cells were subcultured into 6-well plates with a coverslip per well and allowed to attach and grow overnight before examination under a microscope. Establishment of stably transfected cells was performed by co-transfection with pTK-Hg and selected in the presence of 200 μg of hygromycin/ml (Invitrogen). The EGFP-topo I fusion construct (pTI-5) has been described previously (27Mo Y-Y. Wang P. Beck W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). pTI-42 carries the N-terminal region of human topo I (202 amino acids) fused to DsRed protein (pDsRED-N1, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and was constructed as follows. The N-terminal 606 base pairs of topo I was first amplified by PCR using the sense primer I-5.1N GAATTCGCCACCATGGTGGGGGACCACCTGCACAAC, in which the Kozak sequence (28Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar) was introduced in front of ATG for efficient translation of the fusion protein, and the antisense primer I-3.2D GGATCCTCTTTCTTCGGCTTCTTTT. The PCR fragment was cloned into pDsRED-N1 at EcoRI and BamHI sites. Human UBC9 dominant negative (DN) mutant carries the mutation (C93S) and was cloned into the pCMV-Myc vector (CLONTECH). pEGFP-UBC9 and pEGFP-UBC-DN were constructed by cloning UBC9 or UBC9-DN (C93S) into pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH) at BamHI and EcoRI sites. PCR amplification was performed by using primers UBC9–5.1 GGATCCTCGGGGATCGCCCTCAGCA (sense) and UBC9–3.1 CTTATGAGGGCGCAAACTTCTTG (antisense). Protein samples were analyzed by Western blot, as has been described previously (29Mo Y-Y. Beck W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 252: 50-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Topo I-specific antibody TI-I (9Baker S.D. Wadkins R.M. Stewart C.F. Beck W.T. Danks M.K. Cytometry. 1995; 19: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was used to detect topo I. Anti-Myc antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) was used to detect overexpression of UBC9-DN protein. Anti-SUMO antibody was either prepared in one of our laboratories or purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. To detect sumoylation of topo I, cells were treated with Me2SO or TPT at an appropriate concentration for various times. Total protein was extracted using the alkaline lysis solution as described by Desai et al.(30Desai S.D Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24159-24164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Immunostaining was carried out as described previously with a small modification (27Mo Y-Y. Wang P. Beck W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In brief, HeLa cells were grown overnight on coverslips in 6-well plates. The cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized by 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma). After incubation with a primary antibody against either topo I obtained from scleroderma patients (Topogen, Columbus, OH) or promyeolytic leukemia (PML, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), the cells were then incubated with a secondary donkey anti-human antibody labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate or donkey anti-rabbit antibody labeled with rhodamine (Jackson Immuno Research, West Grove, PA). The samples were examined through Zeiss fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) using a filter with maximum excitation at 480 nm and maximum emission at 520 nm for green fluorescence or one with maximum excitation at 550 nm and maximum emission at 600 nm for red fluorescence. To detect subcellular localization of EGFP or DsRED fusion protein, cells were subcultured in 6-well plates on coverslips after transfection with an appropriate plasmid and grown for 16–24 h. When needed, cells were fixed with fixing solution (2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde) before microscopic examination. Fluorescent signals were assessed under Zeiss fluorescence microscope using the same filter as for fluorescein isothiocyanate staining or a filter for red fluorescence as described above. Confocal microscopy was performed in University of Illinois at Chicago Research Resource Center using Zeiss LSM 510. HeLa cells were treated at 43.5 °C for 30 min, and the drug was then added at various concentrations. Fifteen min later, the cells were harvested, and protein was extracted according to the method described above. To detect the effect of heat shock on the sumoylated topo I, HeLa cells were first treated 10 μm TPT for 15 min followed by 30 min of heat shock treatment. As we previously demonstrated (27Mo Y-Y. Wang P. Beck W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), EGFP-topo I fusion constructs are useful tools to investigate the subcellular localization of topo I because they mimic the endogenous topo I at different stages of the cell cycle. Among various constructs we have made in this laboratory, pTI-5 displayed the most intensive nucleolar localization (Fig. 1). To confirm that this nucleolar localization of EGFP-topo I fusion protein correlates with that of the endogenous topo I, we immunostained the cells with topo I-specific antibody. The nucleolar localization of topo I was essentially identical to that of EGFP-topo I fusion protein (Fig. 1), although some small dots (nuclear body-like structures) were seen in a better resolution in pTI-5-transfected cells. In addition to pTI-5, we made pTI-42, which carries the same topo I fragment as in pTI-5 but fused with pDsRED at the N terminus. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that both pTI-5 and pTI-42 resulted in an identical nucleolar localization pattern of the fusion proteins (Fig. 1). Because it has been previously shown that nucleolar topo I moved out of the nucleolus upon treatment of topo I inhibitors or RNA synthesis inhibitors (10Danks M.K. Garrett K.E. Marion R.C. Whipple D.O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1664-1673PubMed Google Scholar, 11Buckwalter C.A. Lin A.H. Tanizawa A. Pommier Y.G. Cheng Y.C. Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1674-1681PubMed Google Scholar), we tested whether the fusion protein behaves as the endogenous topo I for its subnuclear redistribution in response to TPT. Sixteen to 24 h after transfection with pTI-5, the HeLa cells were treated with 10 μm TPT for 30 min. As shown in Fig.1, most of the fusion protein moved out of the nucleolus, which is consistent with our immunostaining data for the endogenous topo I. This nucleolar delocalization seems to be specific for topo I inhibitors because no nucleolar delocalization of topo I was seen for the cells treated with an equi-toxic concentration of VM-26, a topo II inhibitor (27Mo Y-Y. Wang P. Beck W.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the fusion protein seemed to yield a better resolution than the immuno-staining because in TI-5-transfected cells, nuclear body-like structures were clearly seen (Fig. 1). In addition, consistent with the results for pTI-5, we found that the red fusion protein of pTI-42 revealed a similar trend of subnuclear redistribution in response to TPT (Fig. 1). These results indicate that, like the endogenous topo I, EGFP-topo I or DsRED-topo I fusion protein also moves out of the nucleolus after treatment with TPT. It has been shown that topo I is conjugated by SUMO-1 upon treatment with the topo I inhibitor camptothecin (26Mao Y. Sun M. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4046-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Because SUMO-1 binds to many other nuclear proteins such as PML, implying a role for sumoylation in subnuclear distribution of proteins, we sought to determine the relationship between sumoylation of topo I and nucleolar delocalization of the enzyme. First we examined the effect of TPT treatment on sumoylation of topo I in HeLa cells. Western blot analysis detected up to five topo I-specific bands from the HeLa protein extract (Fig.2A, left panel). These high molecular mass bands (>100 kDa) were SUMO-conjugated because they were recognized by SUMO-1 specific antibody (Fig.2A, right panel). Next we examined the sumoylation of topo I in other tumor cell lines under the same conditions. Like HeLa cells, T-lineage leukemic CEM cells showed identical multiple topo I-specific bands (Fig. 2B). CEM/VM-1–5 was derived from CEM cells by cloning after gradual exposure to increasing concentrations of VM-16 and was 140-fold more resistant to VM-16 than CEM cells (31Danks M.K. Schmidt C.A. Cirtain M.C. Suttle D.P. Beck W.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8861-8869Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, similar multiple bands with the same intensity were observed (Fig. 2B). CEM/B1 cells were derived from CEM cells by selection of resistance to merbarone, a catalytic topo II inhibitor, but are moderately cross-resistant to topo I inhibitors (32Kusumoto H. Rodgers Q.E. Boege F. Raimondi S.C. Beck W.T. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2573-2583PubMed Google Scholar). Although the topo I-specific band patterns in CEM and CEM/B1 are identical, the intensity of the bands in CEM/B1 cells was slightly lower than that of CEM cells, possibly because of its low level of resistance to TPT. Nevertheless, the topo I-specific band pattern is similar among all cell lines tested. Thus, it appears that sumoylation of topo I is a general phenomenon in response to TPT. One of roles for sumoylation has been suggested to serve as an addressing tag for targeted proteins (25Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if topo I sumoylation is a tag for its nucleolar delocalization, then sumoylation of topo I should occur earlier than its nucleolar delocalization. Thus, we sought to determine temporal changes of sumoylation of topo I. As shown in Fig.3A, within as little as a 5-min treatment of TPT, multiple topo I-specific bands were detected. At 10 min, the intensity of sumoylated topo I increased and reached a plateau by 15 min. After 30 min, the intensity of the sumoylated topo bands started to decrease. Thus, sumoylated topo I seems to be unstable, and sumoylation of topo I is an early event in response to TPT. To determine whether removal of the drug has any effect on the sumoylated topo I, we washed drug-treated cells and incubated them in the absence of the drug for 1 h. Most of sumoylated topo I bands disappeared (data not shown), suggesting that sumoylation of topo I is reversible. We then examined subnuclear changes of the EGFP-topo I fusion protein (pTI-5) at different time points. For comparison, we treated pTI-5-transfected HeLa cells with the same concentration of TPT (10 μm). We found that although initial nucleolar delocalization of EGFP-topo I fusion protein was seen at 15 min of treatment (Fig. 3B), substantial subnuclear redistribution of EGFP-topo I was not seen until 30 min of treatment. By 45 min, the majority of nucleolar fusion protein moved out of the nucleolus. Therefore, the results clearly indicate that nuclear delocalization of EGFP-topo I occurs later than sumoylation of topo I. Interestingly, although the nucleolar fusion protein disappeared from the nucleolus during the course of drug treatment, we noticed that the intensity of the fluorescent small particles seemed to increase during this period of treatment (Fig. 3B). Therefore, we followed the subnuclear of redistribution of EGFP-topo I for a longer period of time. As shown in Fig. 4B, the increase in intensity of the fluorescent particles persisted through from 1 to 7 h of drug treatment. Although all forms of topo I decreased in the extended period of exposure to TPT, the ratio of sumoylated versus non-sumoylated topo I remained unchanged from 1 to 4 h (Fig. 4A). To investigate the nature of these small particles, we immunostained the cells with anti-PML antibody (red) because PML is predominantly localized in nuclear bodies (33Zhong S. Muller S. Ronchetti S. Freemont P.S. Dejean A. Pandolfi P.P. Blood. 2000; 95: 2748-2752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although they are structurally similar to nuclear bodies, these green fluorescent particles did not colocalize with PML (Fig. 4C). It has been shown previously that heat shock inhibits sumoylation of topo I (34Mao Y. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26066-26073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). By Western blot analysis, we also found that the heat shock inhibited sumoylation of topo I, although heat shock itself led to general sumoylation of other proteins, as seen in Me2SO and heat shock-treated cell extract (Fig.5A). Thus, we asked if heat shock has any effect on nucleolar delocalization of topo I. When the transfected cells were incubated for 30 min at 43.5 °C and then treated with TPT, we found that the fusion protein was no longer translocated out of the nucleolus, whereas without heat shock, the fusion protein moved out as usual in response to TPT (Fig.5B). The DsRED fusion protein revealed a better resolution of subnuclear structure (Fig. 5C). Again, heat shock blocked nucleolar delocalization of the fusion protein caused by TPT. To determine whether heat shock has any effect on the topo I that has already been sumoylated, we first treated HeLa cells with 10 μm TPT for 15 min at 37 °C and then incubated the treated cells at 43.5 °C for 30 min. Although a significant amount of sumoylated topo I was detected before heat shock (Fig.6A), heat shock treatment reversed this process, i.e. sumoylated topo I bands disappeared, suggesting that de-sumoylation or degradation of topo I occurs upon heat shock. Consistent with this observation, fluorescence microscopy revealed that EGFP-topo I fusion protein re-accumulated in the nucleolus after head shock (Fig. 6B), although at a less extent compared with Me2SO control. Because heat shock causes a general stress to the cell and, thus, may affect many other biochemical pathways, inhibition of nucleolar delocalization by heat shock may not necessarily be because of blockage of sumoylation of topo I. To further confirm that sumoylation is an important event for nucleolar delocalization, we overexpressed a UBC9 DN mutant. UBC9 is an E2-conjugating enzyme that is essential to sumoylation (15Schwarz S.E. Matuschewski K. Liakopoulos D. Scheffner M. Jentsch S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar); on the other hand, UBC9-DN blocks sumoylation (35Giorgino F. de Robertis O. Laviola L. Montrone C. Perrini S. McCowen K.C. Smith R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1125-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Overexpression of UBC9-DN was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 7A, upper panel). At the same time, we found UBC9-DN reduced the sumoylation of topo I (Fig. 7A, lower panel) in transiently transfected cells. In addition, we established stably transfected UBC9-DN HeLa cells. Among 24 clones selected, we found 6 of them to express a high level of this recombinant protein (Fig. 7B). As shown in Fig.7C, reduction of sumoylation of topo I was also detected in these stable cell lines (e.g. clones 4 and 13). To better detect the effect of UBC9-DN on subnuclear redistribution of topo I, we co-transfected HeLa cells with pTI-42 (DsRED-topo I) and EGFP-UBC9-DN. For comparison, we also co-transfected HeLa cells with pTI-42 and wild-type UBC9 (EGFP-UBC9). After treatment with 10 μm TPT as above, we found that both wild-type and dominant mutant UBC9 were predominantly in the nucleus, and TPT treatment did not seem to cause any change to the subcellular localization of either wild-type or dominant negative UBC9. However, we observed different effects on the subnuclear localization of DsRED-topo I. For instance, overexpression of UBC9-DN inhibited nucleolar delocalization of DsRED-topo I fusion protein (Fig.8). In contrast, no such inhibitory effect was seen after overexpression of wild-type UBC9 (Fig. 8). Because of the high intensity of the red fusion protein, the overlayered pictures were dominated by the red fluorescence in some cells. In addition, we examined subnuclear redistribution of either EGFP-topo I or DsRED-topo I fusion protein in stably transfected HeLa/UBC9-DN cells. A similar inhibitory effect was seen, although at a less extent, presumably because the protein level of UBC9-DN in individual cells from transient transfection is higher than that in those cells from stable transfection due to a high copy number of the gene. Although topo I is a nucleolar protein, its nucleolar distribution seems to be dynamic, presumably due to the fact that the nucleolus is a non-membrane structure (7Mo Y-Y. Wang C. Beck W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41107-41113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This dynamic change of nucleolar redistribution of topo I is reflected not only in different cell growth conditions but in response to various environmental stimuli. Particularly, nucleolar delocalization of topo I occurs in response to the anticancer drugs (topo I inhibitors) such as camptothecin derivatives or RNA synthesis inhibitors (10Danks M.K. Garrett K.E. Marion R.C. Whipple D.O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1664-1673PubMed Google Scholar, 11Buckwalter C.A. Lin A.H. Tanizawa A. Pommier Y.G. Cheng Y.C. Kaufmann S.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1674-1681PubMed Google Scholar). Because this dynamic change of topo I may alter the cell response to drugs and provide a way for the cell to cope with drug-induced damage, there is great interest in elucidating the molecular mechanism of its nucleolar delocalization. Accordingly, we have examined several factors that affect nucleolar delocalization of topo I in this study. Our results suggest that sumoylation of topo I by TPT treatment is an important molecular event that is associated with nucleolar delocalization of topo I. Early studies have suggested that SUMOs play a role in controlling nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of proteins because sumoylation of RanGAP1 seems to facilitate the interaction of RanGAP1 with the nuclear pore complex (36Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Recent studies, however, indicate that SUMOs may play a more important role in regulating subnuclear distribution of proteins (25Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). It has been shown that a number of nuclear proteins are sumoylated, including PML, p53, MDM2, nuclear receptors such as androgen receptor, and heat shock transcription factor-2 (17Buschmann T. Fuchs S.Y. Lee C.G. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Cell. 2000; 101: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 20Muller S. Berger M. Lehembre F. Seeler J.S. Haupt Y. Dejean A. J.

Of interest, sumoylation has been shown to be essential for PML to accumulate in nuclear bodies (34Mao Y. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26066-26073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). For instance, by recruiting proteins like p53 into the nuclear bodies, PML3 modulates p53 transcription activity (38Fogal V. Gostissa M. Sandy P. Zacchi P. Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Pandolfi P.P. Will H. Schneide C. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6185-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Whether SUMOs direct proteins to nuclear bodies or nuclear bodies support sumoylation or both remains to be determined; it appears, however, that sumoylation is required for this subnuclear redistribution. Once in the nuclear bodies, the sumoylated proteins can be either activated or inactivated. In the case of p53, its transcription activity is increased in the nuclear bodies (38Fogal V. Gostissa M. Sandy P. Zacchi P. Sternsdorf T. Jensen K. Pandolfi P.P. Will H. Schneide C. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6185-6195Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar); by contrast, Daxx, a Fas-binding protein that acts as a co-repressor of transcription (39Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), no longer represses transcription when it is recruited into nuclear bodies (40Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Although the role for topo I sumoylation is still largely undefined, three lines of evidence presented in this study suggest that sumoylation might serve as an addressing tag for nucleolar delocalization of topo I. First, topo I sumoylation occurs earlier than its nucleolar delocalization. Second, heat shock treatment inhibits topo I sumoylation and counteracts the nucleolar delocalization of topo I caused by TPT. Although heat shock causes general stress to the cell and has been shown to increase overall sumoylation of proteins including topo II isozymes, sumoylation of topo I is decreased under the same conditions (34Mao Y. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26066-26073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Third, overexpression of UBC9-DN decreases sumoylation of topo I and at the same time reduces nucleolar delocalization of topo I. Based on the data presented in this study, we believe that upon treatment with TPT, topo I is sumoylated and then translocated out of the nucleolus. Although the fate of topo I is not clear after delocalization from the nucleolus, it is unlikely that it moves out of the nucleus because no cytoplasmic topo I is detected. One possibility is that topo I is redistributed in the nucleoplasm; another possibility is that some fraction of the topo I may accumulate in nuclear bodies. We have found that the intensity of fluorescent protein increases in nuclear body-like structures while the nucleolar fluorescent protein is disappearing, although the nature of the nuclear body-like structures is not clear at this moment. The second possibility may partially explain how the cell copes with DNA damage caused by the drug, a possible rescue mechanism. In this regard, we are currently investigating whether any DNA repair enzymes are recruited into the nuclear body-like structures. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that delocalized topo I is degraded, because topo I inhibitors also cause degradation of topo I (30Desai S.D Liu L.F. Vazquez-Abad D. D'Arpa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24159-24164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Time course experiments suggest that sumoylated topo I is unstable because after 30 min of TPT treatment, the intensity of sumoylated topo I bands decreased significantly (Fig. 3); for a longer period of TPT treatment, overall topo I levels (both unsumoylated and sumoylated topo I) were observed to decrease (Fig. 4A). It is possible that sumoylation of topo I has a high turnover, which might be due to translocation of sumoylated topo I, followed by its de-sumoylation or degradation or both. The mechanism behind sumoylation of topo I is not clear, although DNA damage or conformational changes in topo I caused by topo I inhibitors has been suggested (26Mao Y. Sun M. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4046-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, because TPT itself is an RNA synthesis inhibitor, it is also possible that topo I inhibitors, like RNA synthesis inhibitors, interfere with transcription. Because topo I preferentially binds to supercoiled DNA that is actively transcribed, particularly rDNA (41Madden K.R. Stewart L. Champoux J.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5399-5409Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), once RNA synthesis is inhibited by these drugs, the torsional stress on the DNA region is no longer built up. Under these conditions, a decrease in affinity of topo I for DNA could be expected and, thus, would be released from the nucleolus. Furthermore, we found that sumoylation of topo I was reversed by removal of TPT, and this correlates with nucleolar delocalization of topo I fusion proteins. Thus, any conformational change of the DNA structure, when bound by topo I, might also cause sumoylation of topo I, leading to nucleolar delocalization of topo I. In addition to binding of topo I to the transcribed DNA, topo I also physically interacts with many other nuclear proteins. In this context, it is worth mentioning that the N terminus of topo I, which is essential for in vivo function of topo I, is also a major domain that interacts with several nuclear proteins (42Bharti A.K. Olson M.O. Kufe D.W. Rubin E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1993-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 43Haluska Jr., P. Saleem A. Edwards T.K. Rubin E.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1841-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 44Haluska P.Jr. Saleem A. Rasheed Z. Ahmed F. Su E.W. Liu L.F. Rubin E.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2538-2544Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Whether interaction of these proteins with the N-terminal domain regulates its nucleolar accumulation remains to be determined; however, any interference with the formation of the topo I-containing nucleolar complex may cause its nucleolar delocalization. Therefore, it will be informative to determine whether sumolyation of topo I causes any change to such interactions. Nucleolin is a major nucleolar protein and has been shown to physically interact with topo I. Although binding to topo I by nucleolin does not seem to affect its catalytic activity (42Bharti A.K. Olson M.O. Kufe D.W. Rubin E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1993-1997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to test if such interaction facilitates the formation of nucleolar complexes. The consensus sequences for protein sumoylation have been proposed to be YKXE, where X can be any amino acid,Y is mainly a hydrophobic residue, and K is the residue that is covalently linked to SUMOs (45Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). According to this consensus, we have found five potential sumoylation sites in human topo I: amino acids 102–104 (IKKE), amino acids 116–119 (IKDE), amino acids 152–155 (IKTE), amino acids 327–330 (IKEE), and amino acids 434–437 (IKGE). This prediction seems to be consistent with our data in that we detected at least five sumoylated topo I bands (Fig. 3). Unlike ubiquitination, where polyubiquitination usually occurs, SUMOs have been shown so far to be formed as a single molecule (25Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Interestingly, three of the five potential sumoylation sites on topo I are located at the N terminus. In addition, it has been shown that a nuclear localization signal is required for sumoylation (46Rodriguez M.S. Dargemont C. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12654-12659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar); we have found that the N terminus of topo I is also involved in interacting with UBC9, 2Y-Y. Mo, W. T. Beck, unpublished information. thus, highlighting an importance of this N terminus for its sumoylation. So far, UBC9 has been shown to be the sole E2 enzyme for sumoylation. Cells overexpressing the UBC9-DN are interesting because they not only reveal attenuation of sumoylation of topo I and its nucleolar delocalization, but they also seem to be more sensitive to topo I inhibitors,2 a result that is similar to the finding that yeast expressing temperature-sensitive UBC9 are hypersensitive to camptothecin (26Mao Y. Sun M. Desai S.D. Liu L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4046-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism behind this phenomenon might be complex because overexpression of UBC9-DN may affect other genes, it is nevertheless reasonable to assume that inhibition of sumoylation by the UBC9-DN may contribute to this sensitivity. Furthermore, UBC9 has been implicated in DNA repair, and it physically interacts with DNA repair enzymes such as Rad 51 (47). Therefore, further investigation of the UBC-DN-overexpressing cells is needed to determine the role of UBC9 in drug responsiveness and DNA repair."

Here, we provide evidence for an exception to that rule. Results from immunohistochemistry, spectrophotometry, and single-cell RT-PCR demonstrate that, in the tiger salamander, the green rods and blue-sensitive cones contain the same opsin. In contrast, the two cells express distinct G protein transducin alpha subunits: rod alpha transducin in green rods and cone alpha transducin in blue-sensitive cones. The different transducins do not appear to markedly affect photon sensitivity or response kinetics in the green rod and blue-sensitive cone. This suggests that neither the cell topology or the transducin is sufficient to differentiate the rod and the cone response."

LTF occurred without transcription, but the translation inhibitors cycloheximide and anisomycin, or local presynaptic injection of mRNA cap analog m7GpppG, impaired LTF expression. Both MAP kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase (PI3K) activation are implicated in this rapamycin-sensitive synaptic potentiation. This study defines an important role for protein synthesis in the expression of activity-dependent plasticity, and provides mechanistic insight for the induction of this process at presynaptic sites."
https://openalex.org/W2141680081,"Hepatic ischemia occurs in liver transplantation, hemodynamic or cardiogenic shock, and liver resection associated with trauma or tumor. Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury results in microcirculation failure followed by apoptosis and necrosis. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in many physiological and pathological processes, but their expression and function during liver I/R remains poorly documented. In this study, we evaluated the expression of nine MMPs and their natural inhibitors, tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs), in a rat model of liver I/R. Analysis of MMP and TIMP expression show that although most of these genes are not constitutively expressed in the normal liver, they are induced in a specific time-dependent manner following I/R. Stromelysin-1, gelatinase B, and collagenase-3 are induced during the early phase of acute liver injury associated with inflammation and increased necrosis/apoptosis, whereas gelatinase A, membrane type-MMP, stromelysin-3, metalloelastase, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 are essentially detectable during the recovery phase of liver injury corresponding to hepatocyte regeneration. This observation suggested that MMPs and TIMPs could play both deleterious and beneficial roles following I/R. We thus tested the effect of a specific phosphinic MMP inhibitor on acute liver I/R injury. Inhibition of MMP activity was shown to significantly decrease liver injury in ischemic/reperfused liver tissue as assessed by histological studies and serum hepatic enzyme levels. We therefore propose that MMP inhibitors may be of clinical relevance in liver-associated ischemic diseases or after liver transplantation."

One approach was the use of co-transfection assays and in vitro DNA binding assays, whereas the other approach utilized the available mouse models that harbor different genetic mutations in MITF. In 1996, Kitamura and his colleagues (6Takebayashi K. Chida K. Tsukamoto I. Morii E. Munakata H. Arnheiter H. Kuroki T. Kitamura Y. Nomura S. Mol. Cell.

Kim D.K. Kataoka T.R. Jippo T. Maeyama K. Nojima H. Kitamura Y. Blood. 1999; 93: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MCPs have distinct expression patterns in mast cells from different environments, and important physiological functions have been demonstrated for some of them (13Huang C. Sali A. Stevens R.L. J. Clin. Immunol. 1998; 18: 169-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, their down-regulation in tg/tgmice demonstrates that MITF plays an important role in regulation of the expression of some of the most important mast cell-specific genes. MITF also regulates the transcription of the genes that encode tyrosinase (albino locus), tyrosinase-related protein, and pink-eyed Pmel 17 (silver) (14Bentley N.J. Eisen T. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7996-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Since the latter three genes control pigmentation, decreased expression of MITF in melanoma patients leads to diminished pigmentation.Like many other DNA-binding proteins, the transcription enhancing activity of MITF is influenced in a complex manner by an array of different intracellular proteins. For example, in vitrostudies have indicated that MITF can form heterodimers with the four related family members TFEB, TFEC, TFE3, and USF2 (15Carr C.S. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4384-4388Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 16Beckmann H. Su L.K. Kadesh T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 17Zhao G.Q. Zhao Q.

Blood. 1997; 89: 2999-3008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MITF also synergizes with PEBP2 to increase the rate of transcription of the mMCP-6 gene (19Ogihara H. Kanno T. Morii E. Kim D.-K. Lee Y.-M. Sato M. Kim W.-Y. Nomura S. Ito Y. Kitamura Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4632-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).Since MITF is of global importance in mast cell development, we used a yeast two-hybrid screening approach to identify some of the proteins in this effector cell that interact with MITF (20Razin E.

When a mast cell library was screened with a construct that encodes the bHLH-ZIP domain of MITF, only a few genes with very high affinity to the MITF gene were isolated. Not surprisingly, one of them was TFE3, the member of the MITF-TFE family closest to MITF. Another gene found to have high affinity to MITF was the protein kinase C-interacting protein 1 (PKCI), which is a ubiquitous member of the histidine triad family of proteins (21Lima C.D. Klein M.G. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1997; 278: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We accumulated clear evidence that PKCI functions as a repressor of MITF-induced transcriptional activity (20Razin E. Zhang Z.C. Nechushtan H. Frenkel S. Lee Y.-N. Arudchandran R. Rivera J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34272-34276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the interaction between MITF and PKCI is negatively regulated by cell surface receptor engagement (20Razin E. Zhang Z.C. Nechushtan H. Frenkel S. Lee Y.-N. Arudchandran R. Rivera J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34272-34276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This suggests that PKCI functions as a transcriptional repressor by association with MITF and prevention of MITF recruitment and/or activation of target genes until the appropriate stimulus is encountered.Using the same yeast two-hybrid screening approach in the present work, we have identified the STAT3 inhibitor, PIAS3, as being another gene with high affinity to MITF. All seven STAT proteins directly link cytokine receptor stimulation to gene transcription by acting as both cytosolic messengers and nuclear transcription factors. In unstimulated cells, a STAT protein exists in the cytoplasm as a monomer. Upon activation by tyrosine phosphorylation in response to ligand stimulation, STATs form dimers through SH2-phosphotyrosyl interactions (22Shuai K.

In a yeast two-hybrid screen aimed at the identification of potential regulators of STAT1, a protein was identified which was later named PIAS1 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT1) (22Shuai K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2638-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Four additional mammalian proteins related to PIAS1 were identified through data base searching and cDNA library screening. One of these proteins was PIAS3 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT3), which was found to be a novel protein (22Shuai K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2638-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). In vivoco-immunoprecipitation studies using specific antibody to PIAS3 indicated that PIAS3 interacts with STAT3 (23Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vitro DNA binding analysis suggested that PIAS3 can block the DNA binding activity of STAT3 and, in addition, that PIAS3 inhibits STAT3-mediated gene activation (23Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar).In the present study, we present clear evidence of a function for PIAS3 as a repressor of MITF-induced transcriptional activity and show that STAT3 does not interfere either in vitro or in vivo with the interaction between PIAS3 and MITF.DISCUSSIONMITF has been shown to be capable of binding to several transcription factors, including c-Fos (26Sato M. Morii E. Takebayashi-Suzuki K. Yasui N. Ochi T. Kitamura Y. Nomura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 384-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), USF2 (18Nechushtan H. Zhang Z.C. Razin E. Blood. 1997; 89: 2999-3008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and TFE3 (which also associates with MITF in the yeast two-hybrid screening of mast cells (20Razin E. Zhang Z.C. Nechushtan H. Frenkel S. Lee Y.-N. Arudchandran R. Rivera J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34272-34276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)). In addition, we have described the binding of PKCI to MITF in quiescent cells (20Razin E. Zhang Z.C. Nechushtan H. Frenkel S. Lee Y.-N. Arudchandran R. Rivera J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34272-34276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Now we show that PIAS3 can interact with MITF and inhibit its transcriptional activity.Evidence supporting the idea that PIAS3 is a physiological regulator of MITF is presented in this article. PIAS3 was isolated from the yeast two-hybrid cDNA library using truncated wild type MITF as the bait. It bound to full-length MITF in a pull-down assay in vitro. Moreover, MITF and PIAS3 were found as a complex in quiescent RBL cells and melanocytes in co-immunoprecipatation assays. Using the ability of MITF to activate the transcription of a reporter gene under the control of the MCP-6 gene, we demonstrated that PIAS3 inhibits MITF functionin vivo.The expression of mMCP-6 is highly restricted to mast cells (27Reynolds D.S. Stevens R.L. Lane W.S. Carr M.H. Austen K.F. Serafin W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3230-3234Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), and even fibroblasts in normal tissue do not express this protease (28Stevens R.L. Friend D.S. McNeil H.P. Schiller V. Ghildyal N. Austen K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). mMCP-6 has been shown to be a very potent chemoattractant for neutrophils, suggesting that it plays an important function during many inflammatory processes (29Huang C. Friend D.S. Qiu W.T. Wong G.W. Morales G. Hunt J. Stevens R.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1910-1919PubMed Google Scholar). Kitamura and his group (7Morii E. Tsujimura T. Jippo T. Hashimoto K. Takebayashi K. Tsujino K. Nomura S. Yamamoto M. Kitamura Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have also shown that a short sequence from the MCP-6 promoter contains an MITF response element. Thus the study of MITF activity through experiments performed with the MCP-6 promoter is highly relevant for a better understanding of MITF regulation in mast cells.PIAS3 inhibited the MCP-6 promoter controlled transcription in a dose-dependent manner. The addition of recombinant PIAS3 to MITF and the target oligonucleotide resulted in the decreased binding of MITF containing complexes to DNA and not in the appearance of slower migrating complexes containing DNA bound to MITF and PIAS3 in gel retardation assays. This showed that the inhibition of MITF transcription is a result of decreased DNA binding of MITF caused by PIAS3 and not by the binding of an inactive complex containing MITF and PIAS3 to a response element.Although MITF has been shown to have key regulatory roles both in mast cells and in melanocytes (2Hallsson J.H. Favor J. Hodgkinson C. Glaser T. Lamoreux M.L. Magnusdottir R. Gunnarsson G.J. Sweet H.O. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Steingrimsson E. Genetics. 2000; 155: 291-300PubMed Google Scholar), the role played by STAT3 in receptor-mediated signaling has been poorly reported in mast cells. STAT3 is a latent transcription factor that mediates cytokine- and growth factor-directed transcription. In a variety of hematopoietic-derived cells, receptor stimulation leads to phosporylation of tyrosine residues of STAT, which rapidly triggers DNA binding and STAT-mediated gene transcription (22Shuai K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2638-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 23Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K.

Commun. 2000; 278: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our data strongly suggest that STAT3 does not associate with PIAS3 that is already associated with MITF. Co-transfection of MITF with increasing concentrations of PIAS3 caused dose-dependent repression of MITF transcriptional activity. However, co-transfection of MITF, PIAS3, and STAT3 did not affect the inhibition of MITF transcriptional activity by PIAS3. Thus it seems that the binding of PIAS3 in vivo to MITF might occur under circumstances in which its binding to STAT3 is minimal.The network of transcription factors involved in mast cell regulation is very complex. Here our results point toward two new participants in this network, PIAS3 and STAT3. Understanding the circumstances and mechanisms involved in the regulation of STAT3 and MITF by PIAS3 is our next research goal. The microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF)1 is a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLH-Zip) DNA-binding protein (1Hodgkinson C.A. Moore K.J. Nakayama A. Steingrimsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Arnheiter H. Cell. 1993; 74: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar). Mutation of the MITF gene, which resides at the mi locus in mice, results in deafness, bone loss, small eyes, and poorly pigmented eyes and skin (2Hallsson J.H. Favor J. Hodgkinson C. Glaser T. Lamoreux M.L. Magnusdottir R. Gunnarsson G.J. Sweet H.O. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Steingrimsson E. Genetics. 2000; 155: 291-300PubMed Google Scholar). Mice strains harboring different mutations in the MITF gene have different phenotypes (3Morii E. Ogihara H. Oboki K. Kataoka T.R. Maeyama K. Fisher D.E. Lamoreux M.L. Kitamura Y. Blood. 2001; 98: 2577-2579Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). One of these strains,mi/mi mice, have almost no mast cells (4Kitamura Y. Morii E. Jippo T. Ito A. Int. J. Hematol. 2000; 71: 197-202PubMed Google Scholar). However, the transgenic tg/tg mice, which have an almost total lack of MITF expression (1Hodgkinson C.A. Moore K.J. Nakayama A. Steingrimsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Arnheiter H. Cell. 1993; 74: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar), have a normal number of mast cells (5Kitamura Y. Morii E. Ogihara H. Jippo T. Ito A. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 2001; 124: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The role of MITF in gene regulation has been analyzed using two different approaches. One approach was the use of co-transfection assays and in vitro DNA binding assays, whereas the other approach utilized the available mouse models that harbor different genetic mutations in MITF. In 1996, Kitamura and his colleagues (6Takebayashi K. Chida K. Tsukamoto I. Morii E. Munakata H. Arnheiter H. Kuroki T. Kitamura Y. Nomura S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1203-1211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the MITF protein in mi/mi mice is mainly located in the cytoplasm, and therefore they proposed that the presence of the mutated protein can lead to cellular defect by anchoring MITF hetrodimerization partners in the cytoplasm. MITF regulates the expression of mouse mast cell protease (mMCP)-6 (7Morii E. Tsujimura T. Jippo T. Hashimoto K. Takebayashi K. Tsujino K. Nomura S. Yamamoto M. Kitamura Y. Blood. 1996; 88: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mMCP-5 (8Morii E. Jippo T. Hashimoto K. Kim D.-K. Lee Y.-M. Ogihara H. Tsujino K. Kim H.-M. Kitamura Y.

Blood. 1999; 93: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and cathepsin K (12Motyckova G. Weilbaecher K.N. Horstmann M. Rieman D.J. Fisher D.Z. Fisher D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5798-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Three MCP genes are down-regulated in mast cells not only from themi/mi strain but also from thetg/tg strain (11Ito A. Morii E. Kim D.K. Kataoka T.R. Jippo T. Maeyama K. Nojima H. Kitamura Y. Blood. 1999; 93: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MCPs have distinct expression patterns in mast cells from different environments, and important physiological functions have been demonstrated for some of them (13Huang C. Sali A. Stevens R.L. J. Clin. Immunol. 1998; 18: 169-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, their down-regulation in tg/tgmice demonstrates that MITF plays an important role in regulation of the expression of some of the most important mast cell-specific genes. MITF also regulates the transcription of the genes that encode tyrosinase (albino locus), tyrosinase-related protein, and pink-eyed Pmel 17 (silver) (14Bentley N.J. Eisen T. Goding C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7996-8006Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Since the latter three genes control pigmentation, decreased expression of MITF in melanoma patients leads to diminished pigmentation. Like many other DNA-binding proteins, the transcription enhancing activity of MITF is influenced in a complex manner by an array of different intracellular proteins. For example, in vitrostudies have indicated that MITF can form heterodimers with the four related family members TFEB, TFEC, TFE3, and USF2 (15Carr C.S. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4384-4388Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 16Beckmann H. Su L.K. Kadesh T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 17Zhao G.Q. Zhao Q.

Blood. 1997; 89: 2999-3008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MITF also synergizes with PEBP2 to increase the rate of transcription of the mMCP-6 gene (19Ogihara H. Kanno T. Morii E. Kim D.-K. Lee Y.-M. Sato M. Kim W.-Y. Nomura S. Ito Y. Kitamura Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4632-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Since MITF is of global importance in mast cell development, we used a yeast two-hybrid screening approach to identify some of the proteins in this effector cell that interact with MITF (20Razin E. Zhang Z.C. Nechushtan H. Frenkel S. Lee Y.-N. Arudchandran R. Rivera J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34272-34276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). When a mast cell library was screened with a construct that encodes the bHLH-ZIP domain of MITF, only a few genes with very high affinity to the MITF gene were isolated. Not surprisingly, one of them was TFE3, the member of the MITF-TFE family closest to MITF. Another gene found to have high affinity to MITF was the protein kinase C-interacting protein 1 (PKCI), which is a ubiquitous member of the histidine triad family of proteins (21Lima C.D. Klein M.G. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1997; 278: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). We accumulated clear evidence that PKCI functions as a repressor of MITF-induced transcriptional activity (20Razin E. Zhang Z.C. Nechushtan H. Frenkel S. Lee Y.-N. Arudchandran R. Rivera J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34272-34276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that the interaction between MITF and PKCI is negatively regulated by cell surface receptor engagement (20Razin E. Zhang Z.C. Nechushtan H. Frenkel S. Lee Y.-N. Arudchandran R. Rivera J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34272-34276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This suggests that PKCI functions as a transcriptional repressor by association with MITF and prevention of MITF recruitment and/or activation of target genes until the appropriate stimulus is encountered. Using the same yeast two-hybrid screening approach in the present work, we have identified the STAT3 inhibitor, PIAS3, as being another gene with high affinity to MITF. All seven STAT proteins directly link cytokine receptor stimulation to gene transcription by acting as both cytosolic messengers and nuclear transcription factors. In unstimulated cells, a STAT protein exists in the cytoplasm as a monomer. Upon activation by tyrosine phosphorylation in response to ligand stimulation, STATs form dimers through SH2-phosphotyrosyl interactions (22Shuai K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2638-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). These dimers then translocate into the nucleus to activate transcription. In a yeast two-hybrid screen aimed at the identification of potential regulators of STAT1, a protein was identified which was later named PIAS1 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT1) (22Shuai K. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2638-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Four additional mammalian proteins related to PIAS1 were identified through data base searching and cDNA library screening.

In vivoco-immunoprecipitation studies using specific antibody to PIAS3 indicated that PIAS3 interacts with STAT3 (23Chung C.D. Liao J. Liu B. Rao X. Jay P. Berta P. Shuai K. Science. 1997; 278: 1803-1805Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vitro DNA binding analysis suggested that PIAS3 can block the DNA binding activity of STAT3 and, in addition, that PIAS3 inhibits STAT3-mediated gene activation (23Chung C.D. Liao J.

The network of transcription factors involved in mast cell regulation is very complex. Here our results point toward two new participants in this network, PIAS3 and STAT3. Understanding the circumstances and mechanisms involved in the regulation of STAT3 and MITF by PIAS3 is our next research goal."

Previously we demonstrated that the general RNA splicing factor RNPS1 is a specific PITSLRE p110 kinase interactor in vivo. This suggests that the PITSLRE family of protein kinases is involved in some aspect of RNA processing or transcription. Here we identify multiple transcriptional elongation factors, including ELL2, TFIIF1, TFIIS, and FACT, as PITSLRE kinase-associated proteins. We demonstrate that PITSLRE p110 protein kinases co-immunoprecipitate and/or co-purify with these elongation factors as well as with RNA polymerase II. Antibody-mediated inhibition of PITSLRE kinase specifically suppressed RNA polymerase II-dependent in vitro transcription initiated at a GC-rich (adenosine deaminase) or TATA box-dependent (Ad2ML) promoter, and this suppression was rescued by readdition of purified PITSLRE p110 kinase. Together, these data strongly suggest that PITSLRE protein kinases participate in a signaling pathway that potentially regulates or links transcription and RNA processing events.

It is hypothesized that, in part, regulation of transcription occurs through the active exchange of associated factors with the RNAP II1 complex during these processes, resulting in transcriptional stimulation or repression (1Hampsey M.

This hypothesis is based on the identification of numerous positive and negative regulatory transcription factors/complexes, as well as RNA processing enzymes, in association with RNAP II. Transcriptional elongation is facilitated by cellular factors that include FACT and elongator (2Otero G. Fellows J. Li Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

Many of these complexes exert their effects through direct or indirect association with the RNAP II carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD). The mammalian RNAP II CTD is composed of 52 heptapeptide repeats with the consensus sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser (YSPTSPS) that are essential for viability (8Dahmus M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 171-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The CTD is heavily phosphorylated in vivo, and many protein kinases have been identified that modify this domain. In addition to regulation of transcription initiation and elongation, CTD phosphorylation has been linked to RNA processing events that result in capped, spliced, and tailed mRNA (3Misteli T.

Clearly, phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating the production of mRNA transcripts by affecting the nature of the RNAP II enzyme complex. Several cdks phosphorylate the CTD, and some of these cdks co-purify with RNAP II complexes. These kinases include cdk1, cdk7, cdk8, and cdk9. It is likely that sequential phosphorylation events, as well as phosphorylation of specific residues by specific protein kinases, help regulate transcription from preinitiation through termination. For example, a characterization of cdk7 and cdk8 demonstrated biochemically distinct CTD kinase activity (15Rickert P. Corden J.L. Lees E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1093-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cyclin C/cdk8 interacts with RNAP IIa (hypophosphorylated CTD) complexes that are competent for initiation of transcription (16Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Watanabe D. Takagi T. Hasegawa J. Handa H. J. Biol.

A recent report demonstrates that phosphorylation of cyclin H by cyclin C/cdk8 represses the ability of TFIIH to activate transcription and to phosphorylate the CTD (20Akoulitchev S. Chuikov S. Reinberg D. Nature. 2000; 407: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Cyclin T and cdk9 (PITALRE) were identified as components of the positive transcription elongation factor, which is active after initiation and is responsible for a CTD kinase activity that promotes transcript elongation (21Marshall N.F.

Additional cdk family members exist with unknown functions, including the PITSLRE and the PCTAIRE protein kinases (24MacLachlan T.K. Sang N. Giordano A. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1995; 5: 127-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Two distinct but closely linked human PITSLRE kinase genes (Cdc2L1 andCdc2L2) express at least 20 PITSLRE protein kinase isoforms (25Gururajan R. Lahti J.M. Grenet J. Easton J. Gruber I. Ambros P.F. Kidd V.J. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PITSLRE kinase homologues have been identified in numerous organisms, including chicken, mouse, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, andSchizosaccharomyces pombe (Refs. 26Malek S.N.

The highly conserved nature of these protein kinases and the data accumulated to date suggest important roles in both cell proliferation and apoptosis. The amino-terminal halves of the PITSLRE p110 isoforms contain several distinct domains, including a RD/RE (single amino acid codons for Arg, Asp and Glu) motif and a highly acidic region of glutamic acids. An RNA-binding protein (29Loyer P. Trembley J. Lahti J.M. Kidd V.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and general activator of pre-mRNA splicing (30Mayeda A. Badolato J. Kobayashi R. Zhang M.Q. Gardiner E.M. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4560-4570Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), RNPS1, associates with the amino-terminal domain of p110 in vivo. PITSLRE p110 is localized in the nucleoplasm as well as in nuclear speckles (i.e. intrachromatin granule clusters (IGCs)). IGCs are unique subnuclear structures that appear to be storage and assembly sites for RNA processing and transcription factors, including RNAP II (31Misteli T. Spector D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 32Mintz P.J. Patterson S.D. Neuwald A.F. Spahr C.S. Spector D.L. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4308-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The recruitment of many RNA processing factors from IGCs to active sites of transcription, which are often located at the periphery of the IGCs and in the nucleoplasm, is regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (33Misteli T. Ceres J.F. Clement J.Q. Krainer A.R. Wilkinson M.F. Spector D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 34Misteli T. Spector D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1559-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the PITSLRE p110 isoforms may regulate some aspects of RNA synthesis and processing. Based upon our findings that PITSLRE p110 kinases interact with the general splicing factor RNPS1, as well as with several transcriptional elongation factors reported herein, we believe that PITSLRE kinases may play a role in the regulation of transcription and/or transcript processing. This hypothesis is further supported by experiments demonstrating that the PITSLRE p110 kinases co-purify with complexes containing RNAP II and co-immunoprecipitate with RNAP II in vivo. The transcriptional elongation factor ELL2 was isolated in a two-hybrid interactive screen using only the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain of the PITSLRE p110 protein kinase and was subsequently shown to associate with PITSLRE p110 in vivo. TFIIF and TFIIS, additional transcriptional elongation factors, associate with PITLSRE p110 in mammalian cells by co-immunoprecipitation after extensive purification of transcriptional/RNA processing complexes from the nucleus. Furthermore, both subunits of FACT, an elongation factor that facilitates transcription through nucleosomes, were identified as components of the PITSLRE affinity purified complexes by electrospray capillary liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) analysis. We also show that PITSLRE is present in transcriptionally active complexes. Finally, introduction of both affinity-purified PITSLRE monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, which recognize the carboxyl-terminal protein kinase domain, into in vitro transcription assays specifically suppressed transcript synthesis irrespective of whether the transcription initiated from a TATA-dependent or GC-rich TATA-independent promoter. This suppression was alleviated by the addition of purified PITSLRE p110 protein back into these reactions. Furthermore, antibodies generated to the amino-terminal domain, which excludes the protein kinase domain, had no effect. Taken together, these results strongly support our hypothesis that PITSLRE p110 kinases play some role in the production of translatable RNA transcripts in proliferating cells. All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured as specified. Transfections were carried out using either LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) or FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Polyclonal antibodies to RNPS1 were prepared by immunizing rabbits with a recombinant GST-RNPS1 fusion protein encoding the amino-terminal half of the protein (RNPS1-Δ1, amino acids 1–136), which was produced in bacteria (Rockland). Antibodies were affinity-purified sequentially by first running the serum over GST coupled to Sepharose 4B and then running the flow-through over GST-RNPS1-Δ1 coupled to Sepharose 4B. The antibodies were released with a pH shock (100 mm glycine, pH 2.5) and neutralized with 1 m Tris, pH 8.8. The PITSLRE antibodies P2N100 and GN1 have been described previously (29Loyer P.

PITSLRE mouse monoclonal antibody P1C was produced by immunizing mice with the P1C antigen encoding the last 75 amino acids of PITSLRE p110 as described previously (36Michael N.

A highly purified Mono S column fraction containing the purified RNAP II and its associated protein subunits, prepared by investigators in the laboratory of Dr. D. Reinberg according to previous descriptions, was used for the co-immunoprecipitation/immunoblot experiment shown in Fig.5B (37Maldonado E. Shiekhattar R. Sheldon M. Cho H. Drapkin R. Rickert P.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length ELL2 cDNA was cloned into pGEX 4T for the production of GST-ELL2. The TFIIS cDNA was obtained by polymerase chain reaction, sequenced, and cloned into pGEX 2T for production of GST-TFIIS and into pcDNA3.1 with an amino-terminal FLAG tag for expression in mammalian cells. For the in vitro association assay between GST-ELL2 or GST-RNPS1-Δ2, and PITSLRE p110, CEM-C7 cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 1× complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysate was incubated on ice for 10 min, sonicated for 10 s, and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was precleared by rotation with GST-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C and a low speed centrifugation. The cleared lysate was then diluted 1:5 into Pol II buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.2 mm NaF, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1× complete protease inhibitors). GST-ELL2 or GST-RNPS1-Δ2 beads plus lysate were incubated rotating for 2 h at 4 °C, and the resulting bead complexes were washed four times in 1 ml of Pol II buffer, boiled in protein sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot. The cells were lysed in Pol II buffer as described above for experiments described in Figs. 3, 4B, and 5A. For commercial antibodies, 5 μg of antibody was used per mg of lysate. All immunoprecipitations were washed four times in 1 ml of Pol II buffer or the same buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, unless otherwise noted. For Fig. 4B, the cell lysate was precleared with protein A-agarose and normal mouse serum before immunoprecipitation overnight using the M2 monoclonal antibody beads (50 μl), the His6 monoclonal antibody plus protein A-agarose, or the P2N100 polyclonal antibody plus protein A-agarose in Pol II lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitations were washed four times with Pol II buffer in the presence of 50–150 mmNaCl. In Fig. 5A, lysate was combined with antibody and Gammabind Plus Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and then rotated for 2 h at 4 °C. In Fig. 3 the incubation was performed overnight for part A and for 2 h for part B.Figure 4PITSLRE p110 kinase interacts with the ELL2transcriptional elongation factor in vitro andin vivo.A, GST-ELL2, GST-RNPS1-2, and GST bacterially purified proteins were incubated with CEM C7 lysates (0.25 mg/lane) and subjected to immunoblot analysis for co-precipitation of PITSLRE p110 (GN1 antibody (αGN1)) proteins.

The proteins were eluted by step gradient using 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0 m KCl P11 buffer. The P11 0.5 m KCl PITSLRE p110-containing fractions were dialyzed overnight against 0.1 m KCl-P11 buffer and then loaded onto DEAE-anion exchange column (Bio-Rad). The proteins were step-eluted with 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, and 1.0m of KCl in column buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For further biochemical purification of PITSLRE p110 complex, the DEAE 0.5m fractions containing PITSLRE p110 were loaded onto a SP-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and then a Mono S column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.).

The PITSLRE p110 eluted primarily at the 0.5 m KCl salt concentration. For the affinity purification of PITSLRE p110 complex, the DEAE 0.5m fractions containing PITSLRE p110 were further purified by an affinity column containing P2N100 polyclonal antibody covalently linked to Sepharose. The resulting affinity purified and biochemically purified PITSLRE p110 complexes were subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. Size fractionation analysis was carried out using a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Protein standards of 737, 460, 170, and 65 kDa were used to calibrate the column.

The lysate was incubated on ice for 10 m, sonicated for 10 s, and centrifuged twice at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 10 min. 1 mg of lysate (0.1 ml) was loaded onto the Superose 6 column, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Immunoblot analyses using 30 μl of each fraction were performed. The protein samples were digested with endoproteinase Lys-C and trypsin according to the method of Link et al. (39Link A.J. Eng J.

The supercoiled template DNA was purified by double banding in cesium chloride centrifuged gradients. Transcription reaction mixtures (25 μl of total volume) containing 8 mmHepes, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 6 mmMgCl2, 0.08 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmdithiothreitol, 8% glycerol, 30 units of RNase T1, 100 ng of template DNA, 9–10 μg of HeLa nuclear extract (Promega), and different amounts of affinity-purified antibodies and purified recombinant protein were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min prior to the addition to final concentrations of 0.2 mm of ATP, CTP, and GTP, 8 nm UTP, 0.05 mm3′-O-methyl-guanosine 5′-triphosphate (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and 1 μm [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol). The reaction mixtures were then incubated for 1 h at 30 °C and stopped by the addition of 175 μl of stop solution (0.3m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3 m sodium acetate, 0.5% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 25 μg/ml tRNA) containing an end-labeled extraction control DNA fragment. The reaction solutions were extracted twice with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1, v/v/v), and nucleic acids in the reaction were precipitated by the addition of 600 μl of ethanol and incubation at −70 °C for 30 min. Following centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellet was air-dried and dissolved in 4 μl of nuclease-free water. Equal volume of loading dye (98% formamide, 10 mmEDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) was added to thein vitro transcribed RNA.

J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained. This clone passed all testing for specificity. Both DNA strands of this cDNA clone were sequenced and analyzed using the Genetics Computer Group programs and the GenBankTM data base (Hartwell Center for Bioinformatics and Biotechnology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital). Jurkat total cell lysate was fractionated over a Superose 6 size exclusion column to establish the approximate molecular mass of PITSLRE p110-containing protein complexes. Both the PITSLRE p110 and RNAP II large subunit proteins elute predominantly in those fractions, which correspond to the molecular mass markers in the range of >1 MDa, 730 kDa, and 460 kDa. In fact, these two proteins demonstrate peaks in elution signal in the same fractions (9 and 13). (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that at least two to three different types of PITSLRE p110 kinase complexes are found in the soluble nuclear fraction of mammalian cells. To demonstrate whether the amino-terminal domain, which does not include the protein kinase domain, of PITSLRE p110 is sufficient for co-fractionation with RNAP II, the same experiment was performed with a truncated protein encoding only the amino-terminal 370 amino acids of the kinase (i.e. PITSLRE N370; Ref. 40Tang D. Gururajan R. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16601-16607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The majority of the PITSLRE N370 protein is associated with the fractions containing the >1-MDa protein complexes, which also contain RNAP II (Fig.1B). Thus, the amino-terminal 370 amino acids of PITSLRE p110 appear to be sufficient for PITSLRE p110 association in large molecular mass RNAP II complexes. Examination of RNPS1 distribution by size exclusion chromatography resulted in a very similar distribution to large molecular mass complexes as seen for PITSLRE p110 and RNAP II (data not shown). Thus, two distinct large molecular mass complexes (i.e. >1 MDa and ∼700 kDa) containing RNAP II also include a significant portion of the PITSLRE p110 protein kinase. PITSLRE p110 kinases associate with transcription complexes containing both hypophosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated forms of the RNAP II large subunit. Biochemical purification of PITSLRE p110-containing complexes was undertaken to characterize the proteins contained in the large molecular mass complexes described above. Soluble HeLa cell nuclear extract was fractionated over a series of columns as outlined in Fig. 2. The final eluants were analyzed to identify proteins contained therein. RNAP II was identified by electrospray LC-MS-MS as a PITSLRE co-purifying protein. To further characterize the association of PITSLRE p110 kinase with the RNAP II large subunit, CEM C7 cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either PITSLRE P2N100 or RNAP II 8WG16 antibodies. The resulting PITSLRE antibody-immunoprecipitated complexes were analyzed by immunoblot for the presence of the RNAP II large subunit using the 8WG16 and H5 monoclonal antibodies. The 8WG16 monoclonal antibody specifically recognizes the unphosphorylated form of the repeat within the CTD, whereas the H5 monoclonal antibody is specific for phosphorylated serine at position 2 within the consensus CTD repeat (YSPTSPS) of the RNAP II large subunit. The results shown in Fig. 3A indicate that both the hyperphosphorylated (∼240 kDa) and hypophosphorylated (∼220 kDa) forms of the RNAP II large subunit co-immunoprecipitated with PITSLRE p110.

According to popular current theory, the CaM involved in MLCK regulation is Ca2+-free and dissociated from the kinase at resting cytosolic free Ca2+concentration ([Ca2+]i). An increase in [Ca2+]i saturates the four Ca2+-binding sites of CaM, which then binds to and activates actin-bound MLCK. The results of this study indicate that this theory requires revision. Sufficient CaM was retained after skinning (demembranation) of rat tail arterial smooth muscle in the presence of EGTA to support Ca2+-evoked contraction, as observed previously with other smooth muscle tissues. This tightly bound CaM was released by the CaM antagonist trifluoperazine (TFP) in the presence of Ca2+. Following removal of the (Ca2+)4-CaM-TFP2 complex, Ca2+ no longer induced contraction. The addition of exogenous CaM to TFP-treated tissue at a [Ca2+] subthreshold for contraction or even in the absence of Ca2+(presence of 5 mm EGTA), followed by washout of unbound CaM, restored Ca2+-induced contraction; this required MLCK activation, since it was blocked by the MLCK inhibitor ML-9. The data suggest, therefore, that a specific pool of cellular CaM, tightly bound to myofilaments at resting [Ca2+]i, or even in the absence of Ca2+, is responsible for activation of contraction following a local increase in [Ca2+]. This mechanism would allow for localized changes in [Ca2+] in regions of the cell distant from the myofilaments to regulate distinct Ca2+-dependent processes without triggering a contractile response. Immobilized CaM, therefore, resembles troponin C, the Ca2+-binding regulatory protein of striated muscle, which is also bound to the thin filament in a Ca2+-independent manner.

Immobilized CaM, therefore, resembles troponin C, the Ca2+-binding regulatory protein of striated muscle, which is also bound to the thin filament in a Ca2+-independent manner. The mechanism of activation of smooth muscle contraction is fundamentally different from that of skeletal and cardiac (striated) muscles, although both are triggered by an increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) (1Somlyo A.P.

In striated muscles, Ca2+ binds to troponin C, inducing a conformational change in proteins of the contractile machinery, ultimately enabling actin-myosin interaction and cross-bridge cycling. Smooth muscle cells do not express troponin.

Following an increase in [Ca2+]i, Ca2+ binds to the four Ca2+-binding sites of CaM, which then interacts with and activates MLCK that is tethered via its N terminus to actin (7Dabrowska R. Hinkins S.

It has been suggested more recently, based on the increased affinity of the two C-terminal Ca2+-binding sites of CaM in the presence of MLCK (Kd = 1.1 × 10−7m), that CaM at resting [Ca2+]i may contain two bound Ca2+ ions and therefore interacts with, but does not activate, MLCK (12Johnson J.D. Snyder C. Walsh M.P. Flynn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 761-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). An increase in [Ca2+] in the vicinity of the myofilaments would then saturate the remaining two (the N-terminal) Ca2+-binding sites of CaM (Kd = 2.6 × 10−6m) (12Johnson J.D. Snyder C. Walsh M.P. Flynn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 761-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), inducing a conformational change (collapse of CaM around the CaM-binding domain of MLCK) that leads to activation of the kinase (13Krueger J.K.

A number of observations suggest, however, that a pool of tightly bound CaM may be responsible for activating tension in smooth muscle (e.g. Refs. 15Filo R.S. Bohr D.F. Rüegg J.C. Science. 1965; 147: 1581-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 16Gordon A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3527-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 17Kerrick W.G.L. Hoar P.E. Cassidy P.S. Fed. Proc. 1980; 39: 1558-1563PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, skinned smooth muscle tissues retain the ability to contract in response to micromolar concentrations of Ca2+ and relax upon chelation of Ca2+, concomitant with LC20 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, respectively. The addition of exogenous CaM to skinned smooth muscle preparations enhances the Ca2+sensitivity of contraction without affecting maximal tension development (e.g. Refs. 6Zimmermann B. Somlyo A.V.

Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 357-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that smooth muscle contraction involves the activation by Ca2+ of CaM that is tightly bound to the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, even in the absence of Ca2+, and conclude that the current view of the mechanism of activation of smooth muscle contraction by Ca2+ and CaM requires substantial revision. Triton X-100 was purchased from Fisher, trifluoperazine (TFP) from ICN Biomedicals, Inc., CaM from Sigma, monoclonal anti-CaM from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and 1-(5-chloronaphthalene-1-sulfonyl)homopiperazine-HCl (ML-9) from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. HEPES-Tyrode (H-T) buffer contained 137.0 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.4. Ca2+-free H-T buffer contained 140.6 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.4. Buffer A contained 30 mm TES, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm K2EGTA, 150 mm sucrose, pH 7.4. pCa 9 solution contained 20 mm TES, 4 mm K2EGTA, 5.83 mm MgCl2, 7.56 mm potassium propionate, 1 mm NaN3, 3.9 mmNa2ATP, 0.5 mm dithioerythritol, 16.2 mm phosphocreatine, 15 units ml−1 creatine kinase, pH 6.9. The free [Ca2+] of this pCa 9 solution was determined to be 6 nm using fura-2.pCa 4.5 solution contained 20 mm TES, 4 mm CaEGTA, 5.66 mm MgCl2, 7.53 mm potassium propionate, 1 mm NaN3, 3.9 mm Na2ATP, 0.5 mmdithioerythritol, 16.2 mm phosphocreatine, 15 units ml−1 creatine kinase, pH 6.9. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (300–350 g) were killed by halothane inhalation and decapitation as approved by the Animal Care Committee (Faculty of Medicine, University of Calgary). Excess adventitia and adipose tissue were dissected free from the tail artery in Ca2+-free H-T buffer. Rat tail artery (RTA) segments were placed over a 0.31-mm needle and moved back and forth 40 times to remove the endothelium, prior to cutting into six 1.5-mm helical strips and mounting on a Grass isometric force transducer model FTO3C connected to a PowerLab (ADInstruments) eight-channel recording device. Strips were mounted on the transducer with a resting tension of 0.45 g and incubated for 20 min in H-T buffer (bath volume = 0.8 ml). Tissues were stimulated twice with H-T buffer containing 87 mm KCl (the increase in [KCl] was balanced by a decrease in [NaCl]) with a 20-min interval of relaxation in Ca2+-free H-T buffer. These contractions were consistently of comparable magnitude, and only the second is shown in Fig.2. Following a 10-min relaxation period after the removal of K+, muscle strips were incubated for 5 min in Ca2+-free H-T buffer and for 5 min in buffer A and subsequently skinned by incubation for 2 h in buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100. Skinned tissues were washed three times for 5 min each in pCa 9 solution followed by incubation for 30 min inpCa 4.5 solution to elicit a sustained Ca2+-induced contraction. Skinned muscle strips were then relaxed by incubation in pCa 9 solution for 10 min and washed for 2 × 5 min in pCa 9 solution. A second Ca2+-induced contraction was elicited as before. During the plateau phase of this contraction (30 min after the addition of Ca2+), TFP (0.4 mm) was added, and consequently the muscle slowly relaxed. When force had declined to base line (within 30 min), tissues were washed eight times for 5 min each inpCa 9 solution. Transfer to pCa 4.5 solution for 20 min then failed to elicit a contractile response. After returning topCa 9 solution for 2 × 5 min, the bathing solution was changed to CaM (1.87 μm) in pCa 9 solution orpCa 9 solution alone, and 15 min later any unbound CaM was washed out by incubation for 3 × 5 min in pCa 9 solution. Muscle strips were then incubated in pCa 4.5 solution for 30 min followed by pCa 9 solution (three times for 5 min each). Tissue strips of equal dimensions were processed at points indicated as 1–12 in Fig. 2 for Western blotting with monoclonal anti-CaM at 1 μg ml−1 or polyclonal anti-LC20 (24Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar) at a 1:1,000 dilution. Tissues were quick-frozen by immersion in acetone containing 10% trichloroacetic acid, 10 mm dithiothreitol on dry ice. Trichloroacetic acid was removed by washing three times for 1 min each in 10 mmdithiothreitol in acetone prior to lyophilization for 16 h. Proteins were extracted by tumbling for 2 h in 0.2 ml of SDS gel sample buffer containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Samples (30 μl) were loaded on 15% acrylamide, SDS minigels and electrophoresed at 200 V using a Bio-Rad MiniProtean II apparatus. Gels were then incubated for 10 min in 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and proteins were transferred to 0.2 μm nitrocellulose at 40 V for 3 h in 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 (26Hincke M. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Subsequent procedures are described elsewhere (24Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate were used as the secondary antibodies at a dilution of 1:10,000. To quantify CaM levels, it was necessary to load different amounts of tissue protein to ensure that the enhanced chemiluminescence signal lay on the linear part of the signalversus protein amount relationship (shown to be 0.25–12 ng of CaM). The following loading levels were used for this purpose: 2 μl of a 1:10 dilution for pre- and post-KCl-treated (intact) tissues (points 1 and 3 in Fig. 2); 2 μl (undiluted) for Triton-treated tissue and following the subsequent Ca2+-induced contraction (points 4and 5); 30 μl for all other tissue samples (points 6, 8, and 10). Proteins were extracted from lyophilized tissue samples, and phosphorylated and unphosphorylated LC20 were separated by urea/glycerol gel electrophoresis (30 μl/sample) prior to Western blotting with anti-LC20 as previously described (24Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Where applicable, values are presented as means ± S.E. Data were compared by Student's pairedt test. A level of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. n indicates the number of experiments. Fig. 2A shows a contraction of intact RTA smooth muscle evoked by K+ depolarization; KCl induced a rapid phasic contraction, following which tension decreased to a steady-state level. A return to low [K+] solution resulted in relaxation. The preparation was then skinned (demembranated) by incubation in solution containing 1% Triton X-100 and 5 mm EGTA. Following skinning in the absence of Ca2+, the preparation retained the capacity to contract in response to Ca2+ and relaxed again upon the removal of Ca2+. The amplitude of the Ca2+-induced contraction was comparable with that elicited by K+ depolarization of the intact tissue prior to skinning. A second Ca2+-induced contraction was then elicited and, at the peak of this contraction, 0.4 mm TFP was added in the presence of Ca2+, resulting in relaxation. TFP is a CaM antagonist that binds to CaM in the presence of Ca2+ and displaces CaM from target proteins (27Levin R.M. Weiss B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1977; 13: 690-697PubMed Google Scholar) and has been shown to induce relaxation of Ca2+-contracted, skinned smooth muscle (28Cassidy P. Hoar P.E. Kerrick W.G.L. Pflügers Arch. 1980; 387: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 29Kerrick W.G.L. Hoar P.E. Cassidy P.S. Bolles L. Malencik D.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 77: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). TFP was then removed by extensive washing in the absence of Ca2+. The subsequent addition of Ca2+ failed to induce a contractile response. Following washing in pCa 9 solution, purified CaM was added in the absence of Ca2+, and unbound CaM was then washed out inpCa 9 solution. The subsequent addition of Ca2+resulted in contraction that was reversed on removal of Ca2+. Fig. 2B shows a control experiment with an identical protocol, except that CaM was not added back following TFP treatment. In this case, the subsequent addition of Ca2+failed to elicit a contraction. Cumulative data showing changes in tension under different conditions are depicted in Fig.2C. The CaM contents of similar muscle strips at different stages of the protocol depicted in Fig. 2 were evaluated by Western blotting with anti-CaM (Fig. 3A). In the blot shown in Fig. 3A, the same amount of tissue extract was applied to each lane to allow semiquantitative comparisons to be made. However, to enable accurate quantification of CaM content in the different tissue samples, it was necessary to load different amounts of tissue protein to ensure that the enhanced chemiluminescence signal lay on the linear region of the signal versus protein quantity relationship (histogram in Fig. 3A), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The CaM content of intact muscle prior to and after the K+-induced contraction (points 1 and 3 in Fig. 2) was comparable (Fig.3A, lanes 1 and 3), as expected, and was set at 100%. There was a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in CaM content (to 21.3 ± 6.3%) following Triton skinning (lane 4), which was unaffected by the subsequent Ca2+-induced contraction (15.1 ± 1.2%; lane 5). Treatment with TFP in the presence of Ca2+ and removal of the (Ca2+)4-CaM-TFP2 complex resulted in almost complete loss of cellular CaM (2.1 ± 0.5% remaining;lane 6). Western blotting confirmed that this CaM was recovered in the supernatant (Fig. 6C). The readdition of purified CaM in the absence of Ca2+ and washout of unbound CaM revealed significant Ca2+-independent binding of exogenous CaM (7.8 ± 3.1%; compare lane 8 with lane 6 and the control inlane 10, which retained 0.8 ± 0.25% of total CaM). Western blotting of the same tissue samples with anti-LC20 (Fig. 3B) indicated that the myosin content was constant throughout the protocol. The same was found for the actin-binding protein caldesmon (data not shown).Figure 6TFP treatment is required for removal of tightly bound CaM. The early stages of the protocols are as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Following Ca2+-induced contraction of Triton-skinned tissue, relaxation was induced by the removal of Ca2+(A) or the addition of TFP in the presence of Ca2+ (B). Repeated washes in the absence of Ca2+ (11 times for 5 min each in A or eight times for 5 min each in B) were followed by the addition of Ca2+ (pCa 4.5), which induced a contractile response in A but not in B. C, the bath solution (0.8 ml) was recovered after incubation with TFP in the presence of Ca2+ and lyophilized. The dried sample was redissolved in 0.2 ml of sample buffer and boiled. Aliquots of 15 and 30 μl were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-CaM. The CaM band is clearly visible on the blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) LC20 phosphorylation was also quantified at different stages during the protocol of Fig. 2 by urea/glycerol gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with anti-LC20. A representative gel profile and cumulative data are shown in Fig.4. K+-induced contraction of intact tissue correlated with an increase in LC20phosphorylation from an undetectable level (Fig. 4, lane 1) to 0.25 ± 0.08 mol of Pi·mol of LC20−1 (Fig. 4, lane 2), similar to results obtained with many smooth muscle types (e.g. Refs. 30Hoar P.E.

Following skinning in the absence of Ca2+ and removal of ∼80% of cellular CaM, the addition of Ca2+ resulted in an increase in LC20phosphorylation from 0 to 0.49 ± 0.02 mol of Pi·mol of LC20−1 (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 5). The addition of TFP at the peak of the Ca2+-induced contraction caused complete relaxation and LC20 dephosphorylation (Fig. 4, lane 6). Following removal of the (Ca2+)4-CaM-TFP2 complex, the addition of Ca2+ failed to increase LC20phosphorylation (Fig. 4, lane 7), consistent with failure to elicit a contractile response (Fig. 2A). The readdition of purified CaM in the absence of Ca2+, followed by washout of unbound CaM, resulted in the binding of a significant amount of CaM (Fig. 3A, lane 8) and restored Ca2+-dependent LC20phosphorylation to 0.27 ± 0.04 mol of Pi·mol of LC20−1 (Fig. 4, lane 9), sufficient to elicit a contraction (Fig. 2A). Subsequent removal of Ca2+ resulted in relaxation (Fig. 2A) and complete dephosphorylation of LC20 (Fig. 4,lane 12). In control tissues to which exogenous CaM was not added, the addition of Ca2+ failed to increase LC20 phosphorylation (Fig. 4, lane 11) and failed to elicit a contractile response (Fig.2B). The Ca2+-activated contractile response that was restored by binding of exogenous CaM in the absence of Ca2+ was inhibited by the MLCK-selective inhibitor, ML-9 (34Ishikawa T. Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Mamiya S. Saitoh M. Hidaka H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1988; 33: 598-603PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 5), indicating the requirement for activation of MLCK.Figure 5Contraction elicited by exogenous calmodulin bound in the absence of Ca2+ is inhibited by ML-9.Tissues were treated as in the protocol of Fig. 2A. The early stages of the protocol are not shown. The traces show Ca2+-induced contraction of Triton-skinned muscle and relaxation due to the removal of tightly bound CaM by treatment with TFP. Following the removal of the (Ca2+)4-CaM-TFP2 complex, the addition of exogenous CaM in the absence of Ca2+, and washout of unbound CaM, muscle strips were incubated in the presence (A) or absence (B) of ML-9 (3 μm) prior to the addition of Ca2+. ML-9 was dissolved in 50% ethanol, and the final concentration of ethanol in the bath solution was 0.5% in both A and B. The final Ca2+-induced contraction was completely inhibited by ML-9. Results are representative of n = 3 experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TFP treatment was required to remove the endogenous CaM that remained following skinning in the presence of EGTA. As shown in Fig.6A, Ca2+-induced contraction of skinned RTA, followed by 11 washes (5 min each) inpCa 9 solution, did not markedly affect subsequent Ca2+-induced contraction, whereas TFP treatment abolished this contractile response (Fig. 6B), as shown earlier (Fig.2). There is, therefore, a pool of CaM, tightly bound to the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction even in the absence of Ca2+, which is capable of supporting an MLCK-dependent contractile response. The Western blot with anti-CaM in Fig. 6C verified that CaM was indeed quantitatively extracted by TFP treatment. Exogenous CaM also bound to CaM-depleted RTA at a [Ca2+] subthreshold for contraction (pCa 6.5) (i.e.close to resting [Ca2+]i) (Fig.7). We considered the possibility that a small amount of the exogenous CaM that binds to skinned smooth muscle in the absence of Ca2+could dissociate to yield a sufficiently high concentration of free CaM to account for the restoration of Ca2+-induced contraction. From our quantification of the amount of CaM binding to the skinned muscle in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3A), we calculated that, if all of this CaM were released into the bathing solution (0.8 ml), the concentration of CaM would be 1.3 nm. To determine whether this would be sufficient to activate Ca2+-dependent contraction of CaM-depleted skinned RTA, we removed endogenous CaM with TFP, as described above, added Ca2+ (pCa 4.5), which had no effect, and then added 1.3 nm CaM, in the continued presence of Ca2+. No contraction occurred (Fig.8A). Similarly, no contraction occurred even at 5, 10, or 20 nm added CaM (Fig. 8,B–D), but the subsequent addition of 1.87 μmCaM elicited a maximal contraction in each case, confirming the continued viability of the preparation. At 100 nm exogenous CaM, a slow, partial contraction (35% of maximal Ca2+-induced contraction) was observed (Fig.8E). Cumulative additions of CaM to the same muscle strip (to 20 nm) also failed to elicit a contraction (Fig.8F). Controls (Fig. 8, G and H) show the effects of the addition of excess CaM (1.87 μm) to CaM-depleted tissues at various stages of the protocol. The contractile response to exogenous CaM bound in the absence of Ca2+(Fig. 2A), therefore, cannot be due to dissociation of this bound CaM into the bathing solution, where it can bind Ca2+, diffuse to and interact with MLCK, and phosphorylate myosin. The fact that exogenous CaM bound in the absence of Ca2+does not dissociate to a significant degree during repeated washing was also indicated by the observation that this CaM supports several sequential Ca2+-induced contractions separated by washout in pCa 9 solution. Western blotting with anti-CaM confirmed that exogenous CaM bound in the absence of Ca2+ was fully retained following repeated Ca2+ stimulation and washout (data not shown). The results of this study suggest that rat tail arterial smooth muscle contains a pool of CaM that is tightly bound to the Triton-insoluble fraction at subthreshold [Ca2+]i, or even in the absence of Ca2+, and that the current view that (Ca2+)4-CaM diffuses to MLCK on the thin filaments to permit activation is unlikely to be correct. The most reasonable interpretation of our results is that CaM is binding to MLCK in the absence of Ca2+, since exogenous bound CaM supports a Ca2+-dependent contraction that is inhibited by the MLCK inhibitor ML-9, and there is no evidence for dissociation of the exogenous bound CaM from the Triton-insoluble fraction. We suggest, therefore, that the contractile CaM is permanently bound to a protein component of the myofilaments, most likely MLCK, although additional investigations using, for example, chemical cross-linking will be necessary to test this hypothesis. While it remains possible that exogenous CaM is binding to a target other than MLCK, this seems an unlikely scenario, since it would require that, upon an increase in [Ca2+]i, either (i) the CaM would have to dissociate from this binding protein and bind to and activate MLCK, an unlikely event given the results in Fig. 8, or (ii) the CaM would remain bound to this binding protein and, in the presence of Ca2+, would also be able to bind to and activate MLCK. We envision the CaM bound to MLCK in the absence of Ca2+, much like the δ subunit (CaM) of phosphorylase kinase, the kinase being activated upon Ca2+ binding to CaM (35Brushia R.J. Walsh D.A. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: 618-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If the Ca2+-independent binding site for CaM is indeed MLCK, then the interaction between CaM and the myofilament-associated kinase must be quite different from the interaction between CaM and purified MLCK, which is absolutely Ca2+-dependent (36Adelstein R.S. Klee C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7501-7509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Stull J.T. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1997; 18: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility that a distinct protein component of the myofilaments affects the CaM-MLCK interaction. Alternatively, the conformation of MLCK bound to the myofilaments may be different from that of the free kinase and, in this conformation, be able to bind CaM in a Ca2+-independent manner. We conclude, therefore, that the pool of CaM that is involved in regulation of MLCK activity and smooth muscle contraction is very tightly bound, similar to the association of troponin C with the myofilaments of skeletal and cardiac muscles. Several studies have suggested that very little of the CaM in a resting smooth muscle cell (<5%) is unbound (freely diffusible), consistent with binding to a number of targets at the low [Ca2+]i in the unstimulated cell (38Luby-Phelps K.

While some of this bound CaM may be in equilibrium with free cytosolic CaM, the rest is probably tightly bound, as in the case of the contractile CaM described here. Published reports indicate tissue concentrations of ∼40 μm for CaM (6Zimmermann B. Somlyo A.V. Ellis-Davies G.C.R. Kaplan J.H. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 9912-9920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that ∼8% of total CaM binds to the Triton-insoluble fraction after depletion of endogenous CaM with TFP and the addition of exogenous CaM in the absence of Ca2+, followed by washout of unbound CaM (Fig. 3A). This corresponds to 3.2 μm CaM (i.e. close to 1:1 CaM/MLCK), since all of the MLCK is retained in the skinned smooth muscle (24Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This amount of bound CaM supports maximal Ca2+-induced contraction, since the addition of excess CaM (1.87 μm) at point 9 of the protocol in Fig.2A caused no additional force development (data not shown). Our results suggest, therefore, that the mechanism of activation of smooth muscle contraction by Ca2+ and CaM is as depicted in Fig. 1B, as opposed to the current model depicted in Fig.1A. Combined with previous observations with various skinned smooth muscle preparations, this is likely to be a general property of smooth muscle (6Zimmermann B. Somlyo A.V. Ellis-Davies G.C.R.

Release of Ca2+ from the SR or entry from the extracellular space is followed by diffusion to the myofilaments, where it binds to CaM that is complexed with MLCK anchored to the thin filaments. Van Breemen and co-workers (42Lee C.-H. Poburko D. Sahota P. Sandhu J. Ruehlmann D.O. van Breemen C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 534: 641-650Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar) have proposed a model whereby contractile Ca2+ is released from the SR directly into the vicinity of the myofilaments. The existence of a pool of CaM permanently bound to MLCK on the thin filament could then be selectively activated by this released Ca2+. One could then envisage a distinct pool of Ca2+ entering the sarcoplasm from the extracellular space via, for example, L-type Ca2+channels that are located in regions of the plasma membrane not apposed to SR elements. Such a process could regulate other Ca2+-dependent events without effecting a contractile response. Although our data suggest that CaM binding to MLCK in situis Ca2+-independent, it is possible that, at resting [Ca2+]i (∼130–140 nm) (43Williams D.A. Fay F.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 250: C779-C791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Williams D.A. Becker P.L. Fay F.S. Science. 1987; 235: 1644-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), at least some of the bound CaM contains two Ca2+ ions bound to the two C-terminal Ca2+-binding sites, since the Ca2+ binding affinity of these sites is enhanced ∼10-fold, to Kd 1.1 × 10−7m, in the presence of a peptide corresponding to the CaM-binding domain of MLCK (12Johnson J.D. Snyder C. Walsh M.P. Flynn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 761-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, our results clearly show that the tight binding of CaM to MLCK in the tissue does not require any bound Ca2+. At resting [Ca2+]i, therefore, contractile CaM is probably bound to MLCK and consists of a mixture of (Ca2+)0-CaM and (Ca2+)2-CaM, neither of which is capable of activation of the kinase. If the [Ca2+] in the vicinity of the myofilaments reaches a high enough level, Ca2+ will saturate the four Ca2+-binding sites of CaM, inducing a conformational change that is transmitted to MLCK (13Krueger J.K. Olah G.A. Rokop S.E. Zhi G. Stull J.T. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6017-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), resulting in its activation; the Kd of the N-terminal Ca2+-binding sites is 2.6 × 10−6m (12Johnson J.D. Snyder C. Walsh M.P. Flynn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 761-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Activated MLCK then phosphorylates LC20in the neck region of the myosin head, triggering cross-bridge cycling. This mechanism of Ca2+-mediated excitation-contraction coupling resembles that of striated muscles with CaM being equivalent to the homologous EF hand Ca2+-binding protein troponin C, which is also bound to the thin filament. While the association of troponin C with the myofilaments is stabilized by 2 Mg2+ions, this does not appear to be the case for CaM, which specifically binds Ca2+ at physiological concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+ (45Klee C.B. Vanaman T.C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 213-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). As noted above, the mechanism depicted in Fig. 1B has the additional attractive feature that, unlike the existing model for activation of smooth muscle contraction (Fig. 1A), it allows local changes in [Ca2+] remote from the contractile machinery to regulate distinct functions (e.g. regulation of ion channels, receptors, or exchangers) without eliciting a contractile response. Since the mechanism of activation of nonmuscle motile processes, such as cytokinesis, cell migration, transepithelial permeability, and fibroblast contraction, is thought also to involve Ca2+/CaM-dependent phosphorylation of myosin (5Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4527-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 46Kolodney M.S. Elson E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23850-23855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this work is also of fundamental relevance to regulation of nonmuscle motility. We are very grateful to Drs.

Although the role of these two cell types in vision is still unknown, an attractive hypothesis is that simple cells are necessary to construct complex receptive fields. This hierarchical model puts forward two main predictions. First, simple cells should connect monosynaptically to complex cells. Second, complex cells should become silent when simple cells are inactivated. We have recently provided evidence for the first prediction, and here we do the same for the second. In summary, our results suggest that the receptive fields of most layer 2+3 complex cells are generated by a mechanism that requires simple cell inputs."

Full catalytic activity requires the presence of three protein components. Reductive activation of dioxygen and the oxidation of methane occur at carboxylate-bridged diiron centers in the α subunits of the hydroxylase enzyme MMOH, a 251-kDa α2β2γ2 protein. A reductase, MMOR, which contains both a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin and an FAD (flavine adenine dinucleotide) domain, provides electrons to MMOH by oxidizing NADH to NAD+.

The 5.5-kb operon that houses the genes for MMOH (mmoX, mmoY, mmoZ), MMOR (mmoC), and MMOB (mmoB) contains one additional open reading frame (orfY) positioned between mmoZand mmoC (Fig. 1). The 12-kDa protein encoded by orfY, which we will refer to hereafter as MMOD, has not yet been isolated from any of these methanotrophs, and its role remains uncertain (19Coufal D.E. Blazyk J.L.

Although the overall percent identity for the putative orfY products is fairly low (19.4%), there is a central region (residues 41–85 in M. capsulatus (Bath)) with a significantly greater number of conserved residues (44.4%) (Fig. 2). Northern blot analysis of total RNA from M. capsulatus(Bath) revealed a 5.5-kb mRNA fragment containing all six ORFs, suggesting that orfY may be expressed and play an important role in the sMMO system (26Nielsen A.K.

Microbiol. 1997; 25: 399-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). One possibility is that the protein is involved in the assembly of the hydroxylase diiron centers. Evidence for such a function exists for a protein, DmpK, of similar size but no apparent sequence homology, in phenol hydroxylase fromPseudomonas sp. CF600 (28Powlowski J. Sealy J. Shingler V.

This enzyme system shares significant homology with sMMO and, like the latter, consists of a hydroxylase with a similar diiron center, a reductase, and a MMOB-like protein (19Coufal D.E. Blazyk J.L.

Western blot analysis of M. capsulatus (Bath) soluble cell extracts with antibodies raised against MMOD clearly demonstrated that the protein is expressed in this methanotroph. The interaction of MMOD with the other sMMO proteins was studied in vitro by using kinetic, biochemical, and spectroscopic techniques. MMOD inhibits the sMMO-catalyzed epoxidation of propylene and binds to MMOH with an affinity similar to that of MMOB and MMOR. These results clearly indicate a functional role for MMOD in the sMMO system. MMOH was purified fromM. capsulatus (Bath) as described previously (35Fox B.G. Froland W.A. Jollie D.R. Lipscomb J.D.

Lippard, unpublished results. yielded material containing <0.1 iron/protein in 80–90% yield. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed with precast gels (Bio-Rad) and the standard Tris-glycine buffer system. Protein concentrations were determined by measuring the absorption at 280 nm for MMOH (ε = 665,000 m−1cm−1) and MMOB (ε = 19,300m−1 cm−1) and at 458 nm for MMOR (ε = 20,800 m−1 cm−1) (16Gassner G.T. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12768-12785Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). For MMOD an extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 26,300m−1 cm−1 was determined experimentally on the basis of total amino acid analysis (Biopolymers Laboratory, Harvard Medical School). N-terminal amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry of purified MMOD were performed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Biopolymers Laboratory using a PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems 494 protein sequencer and a Sciex API 365 triple stage mass spectrometer, respectively. Metal analyses were carried out by atomic absorption spectroscopy on a PerkinElmer HGA800 instrument equipped with a graphite furnace. Various models describing the kinetic data and the curves for MMOD binding to MMOHox were analyzed by using the program Dynafit (BioKin, Madison, WI) (37Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). The orfY gene was amplified from plasmid pCH4 (gift from J. C. Murrell, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK), which contains the entire sMMO operon, by usingPfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and the following primers: 5′-GGTATTGAGGGTCGCATGGTCGAATCGGCATTTCAGC-3′ and 5′-AGAGGAGAGTTAGAGCCTCAATGTTGAACTCCGCCGCTC-3′. Overhangs compatible with the LIC (ligation-independent cloning) sites of the pET32Xa/LIC plasmid (Novagen) were generated by treating the PCR product with T4 DNA polymerase in the presence of GTP, following the manufacturer's protocol. The PCR product with LIC overhangs was added to linearized pET32Xa/LIC, yielding the vector pET32orfY. The pET32orfY plasmid mixture was transformed into E. coli NovaBlue Singles competent cells (Novagen) and plated on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Positive clones were identified by restriction digest analysis. DNA sequencing using T7 promoter and T7 termination site primers confirmed that pET32orfY contained the expected sequence. The expression plasmid pET32orfY was transformed into E. coliBL21(DE3) cells. A 100-ml solution of LB medium with 200 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with 1 ml of a glycerol stock solution of BL21(DE3)/pET32orfY and grown at 37 °C/200 rpm until theA 600 nm reached 0.6–1.0. This 100-ml culture was used to inoculate 8 × 0.5 liters of LB medium (200 μg/ml ampicillin), and the cells were grown at 37 °C/200 rpm untilA 600 nm = 0.4. The temperature was lowered to 30 °C, and protein expression was induced by adding 0.08 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside atA 600 nm = 0.6. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 3–4 h after induction, resuspended in 90 ml of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, pH 7.5) containing 5 mmMgCl2 and 200 units of DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and cracked by sonication. Insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the supernatant was stored at −80 °C. Soluble cell extract containing the Trx-MMOD fusion protein (3 ml/1 ml of resin) was loaded on a nickel-HisBind column (Novagen). The column was washed with 10 volumes of binding buffer, 5 volumes of washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 60 mmimidazole, pH 7.5), and 2 volumes of factor Xa cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, pH 8.0). Finally, one column volume of factor Xa cleavage buffer with 40 units/ml of factor Xa protease (Novagen) was loaded on the column. After overnight incubation (∼ 13 h) of factor Xa on the column at room temperature, MMOD was eluted from the column with washing buffer. After the addition of 2 mmDTT and 1 mm Pefabloc SC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), the protein was concentrated and further purified on a Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) column (2.5 × 70 cm) using 25 mm MOPS, 120 mm NaCl, 2 mmDTT, pH 7.0, as buffer. Typical yields were 40 mg of pure MMOD/liter ofE. coli culture. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against MMOD were produced by Covance Research (Denver, PA). Soluble cell extracts of M. capsulatus (Bath) and pure MMOD samples of known concentration were boiled for 5 min in SDS- and β-mercaptoethanol-containing sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE on 4–20% gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets with the Bio-Rad mini-blotting system. Western blots were developed using 1:2000-diluted primary antibody, 1:2000-diluted donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and chemiluminesence detection. Quantification was performed by integrating the bands with Multi-Analyst software (Bio-Rad). Chemical cross-linking experiments were performed essentially as described previously for sMMO from M. trichosporium OB3b (38Fox B.G. Liu Y. Dege J.E. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 540-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1-Ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC, Pierce) was used as a zero-length cross-linking reagent. Reactions were performed for 30 min at ambient temperature in 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, using EDC at a final concentration of 50 mm and protein concentrations of 4 μm MMOH, 8 μm MMOB, 4 μm MMOR, 8 μm MMOD, and 4 μmMMODdimer. The reaction was quenched by the addition of an equal amount of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were boiled for 5 min and analyzed with 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The oxygenase activity of sMMO was assayed by monitoring the formation of propylene oxide from propylene by gas chromatography (16Gassner G.T. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12768-12785Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Assays were carried out at 25 °C in 25 mm MOPS, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.0, buffer containing 1.5 μm MMOH, various amounts of MMOB, 0.75 μm MMOR, 1 mm propylene, 0.2 mmNADH, and various amounts of MMOD or MMODdimer in a total volume of 1.30 ml. Reactions were started by the addition of NADH and quenched after 2 min by the addition of 200 μl CHCl3. Aliquots of 5 μl were taken from the CHCl3 fraction and analyzed with a Hewlett-Packard 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a Deactiglas Porapak Q column. The oxidase activity was assayed by monitoring the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ optically at 340 nm (ε340 nm = 6200 m−1cm−1). Optical titration studies were performed at room temperature with an HP8354 diode array spectrophotometer (Hewlett Packard). The cuvette was filled with 600 μl of 25 mm MOPS, 100 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.0, and a blank spectrum was recorded. A 30-μl aliquot of MMOH was added from a concentrated stock solution and spectrum 1 was recorded. An aliquot of MMOD was added from a concentrated stock solution, and spectrum 2 was recorded. After correcting for dilution, a difference spectrum was calculated by subtracting spectrum 1 from spectrum 2. The MMOH and MMOD stock solutions were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C immediately before the titration, to remove small quantities of precipitated protein, and a new sample of MMOH was used for each data point in the titration. ApoMMOH (47.5 μm) was incubated with 0.5 mmFe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O in 25 mm MOPS, 120 mm NaCl, 2 mmDTT, 5% (v/v) glycerol, pH 7.0, at 25 °C. At several times after adding the iron, samples were taken and assayed for propylene activity as described above. The reconstitution reaction was monitored in the absence of other sMMO proteins or in the presence of 48.5 μm MMOD, 97 μm MMOD, or 97 μmMMOB. Initial expression trials of MMOD in E. coli from vectors pTrc99A and pKK223-3 did not yield high levels of a soluble 12-kDa protein. The absence of a specific assay or antibody for MMOD hindered the optimization of the conditions for expression, and we therefore decided to express MMOD as a fusion protein using the vector pET32Xa. The fusion protein encoded by this vector consists of thioredoxin followed by a His6 tag, a thrombin cleavage site, an S tag, a factor Xa cleavage site, and MMOD. The N-terminal thioredoxin domain ensures efficient translation initiation and enhances the solubility of the fusion protein. The His6 tag allows purification on a nickel column. The orfY gene was cloned immediately on the C-terminal side of the factor Xa proteolytic cleavage site. Recombinant MMOD with the native sequence could therefore be obtained upon treatment of the fusion protein with factor Xa. High expression levels of Trx-MMOD were observed for E. coliBl21(DE3)/pETorfY induced with 80 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C. The fusion protein was purified in a single step using nickel-HisBind column chromatography. Treatment of Trx-MMOD with factor Xa resulted in the efficient cleavage of the fusion protein, and a subsequent second nickel-HisBind column step allowed removal of MMOD from the remainder of fusion protein that still contained the His6 tag. We also developed a novel purification procedure for MMOD in which proteolytic cleavage of Trx-MMOD was performed while still bound to the nickel-HisBind column. Incubation of column-bound Trx-MMOD with factor Xa overnight at ambient temperature resulted in efficient cleavage of the fusion protein, which could subsequently be eluted from the column with 60 mm imidazole. Uncleaved Trx-MMOD and the remainder of the fusion protein stayed bound to the column under these conditions. This method is more efficient because it allows purification of MMOD directly from the E. coli soluble cell extract in single step. The MMOD eluted from the nickel-HisBind column was further purified from factor Xa, small peptide impurities, and imidazole by Superdex 75 column chromatography. Sequence analysis revealed that purified MMOD contained the expected N-terminal sequence (Met-Val-Glu-Ser-Ala) with no contaminating proteins. ESI-MS (electron spray ionization mass spectrometry) of protein purified in the absence of DTT revealed peaks at 11,942 and 23,884 Da (calculated molecular mass, 11,942.2 Da). The 23,884 Da peak corresponds to a homodimer, which we ascribe to oxidation of the single cysteine residue in MMOD to form an intermolecular disulfide bond. The addition of DTT slowly reversed this dimerization. The addition of DTT in all steps immediately after elution of MMOD from the nickel-HisBind column prevented formation of the dimer. Metal analysis using atomic absorption spectroscopy showed the absence of any iron, manganese, or nickel. The MMOD optical spectrum lacked absorbance features other than the band at 280 nm, indicating that it did not contain organic cofactors such as heme and flavin. To learn whether MMOD might function in the sMMO system, we investigated the possibility that MMOD is expressed in M. capsulatus(Bath). Recombinant MMOD was used to generate MMOD-specific polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. Soluble cell extracts were prepared fromM. capsulatus (Bath) grown in a fermentor under low copper conditions. Western blot analysis clearly showed the presence of MMOD under these conditions in the M. capsulatus (Bath) cells (Fig. 3). Quantitative Western blot analysis of both MMOD and MMOH from four different M. capsulatus (Bath) cell batches ranging inA 540 nm from 7.8 to 9.8 showed the presence of 1.8 ± 0.8 mol % MMOD/mol of MMOH. The sMMO-catalyzed epoxidation of propylene to propylene oxide was studied at varying concentrations of MMOD monomer (MMOD) and dimer (MMODdimer) (Fig. 4). The addition of MMOD resulted in the complete inhibition of sMMO activity, whereas no inhibition was observed in the presence of MMODdimer. To test whether MMOD inhibits sMMO by interfering with MMOB binding to MMOH, as was suggested for DmpK (28Powlowski J. Sealy J. Shingler V. Cadieux E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 945-951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), the effect of MMOD was studied at different MMOB/MMOH ratios of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 5 (Fig. 5). Several models (Scheme FS1) were considered to describe the individual curves (see panels B–F in Fig. 5). In Model 1 a simple equilibrium between MMO, representing the active enzyme without specifying the precise MMOH:MMOB stoichiometry, and an inactive MMO-MMOD complex is assumed. This model, however, does not fit the data well at low MMOB and MMOD concentrations (see Fig. S1 and Scheme S1 in the supplemental material). The competitive Model 2, in which MMOB and MMOD compete for the same or closely related sites on the hydroxylase, modeled our data much better and was used to generate the fits shown in Fig. 5. In this model, the MMOH-MMOB complex is considered the only catalytically active species. TableI lists the parameters obtained from fitting the data with Model 2. We also considered a model in which MMOD binds preferably to the MMOH-MMOB complex (Model 3, uncompetitive). Again, the MMOH-MMOB complex was assumed to be the only catalytically active species. Like Model 1, Model 3 does not satisfactorily describe the curvature at low MMOB and MMOD concentrations (see Fig. S2 and Scheme S2 in the supplemental material). The kinetic data are thus most consistent with a model in which MMOD binding to MMOH prevents the binding of MMOB and thereby inhibits sMMO activity.Figure 5Inhibition by MMOD of the sMMO-catalyzed oxidation of propylene at different concentrations of MMOB.A, 0 μm; B, 0.75 μm;C, 1.5 μm, D, 3.0 μm;E, 4.5 μm; and F, 7.5 μm.

This astonishing example of perceptual invariance results from a comparison of visual information with internal reference signals predicting the visual consequences of an eye movement. Here we demonstrate that the reference signal predicting the consequences of smooth-pursuit eye movements is continuously calibrated on the basis of direction-selective interactions between the pursuit motor command and the rotational flow induced by the eye movement, thereby minimizing imperfections of the reference signal and guaranteeing an ecologically optimal interpretation of visual motion."
https://openalex.org/W2170411747,"Many growth factors and cytokines are involved in liver regeneration. Of them, only hepatopoietin (HPO)/ALR (augmenter of liver regeneration) is a specifically hepatotrophic factor originally identified from the cytosol of regenerating or hyperplastic hepatic cells. Previous reports indicate that extracellular HPO triggers the MAPK pathway by binding its specific receptor on the cell surface. However, its function in the cytosol of hepatocytes is unclear. Here we identified that JAB1 (Jun activation domain-binding protein 1), a co-activator of AP-1, which is essential for liver regeneration, specifically interacts with intracellular HPO. JAB1 colocalizes with HPO in nuclei of hepatic cells or COS-7 cells. As an intracrine factor, the intracellular function of HPO is to increase c-Jun phosphorylation independent of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) -1 and -2, and leads to potentiation of JAB1-mediated AP-1 activation. Amino acids 1-63 of HPO molecule are sufficient to bind to JAB1, but the full-length HPO is necessary for its intracellular signaling. Taken together, these results elucidate a novel mechanism of intracrine cytokine signaling by specifically modulating the AP-1 pathway through JAB1, in a MAPK-independent fashion."

Mass changes caused by covalent modifications were measured in a dose- and time-dependent manner following inhibition of phosphatases by okadaic acid.

Okadaic acid also partially blocked H4 hyperacetylation induced by trichostatin-A, suggesting that the mechanism of deacetylation involves inhibition of H4 acetyltransferase activity, following perturbation of cellular phosphatases. In addition, mass changes in H3 in response to okadaic acid were consistent with phosphorylation of methylated, acetylated, and phosphorylated forms.

Less well understood is whether covalent regulation of histones may also occur on a global level, affecting total nucleosome populations. This aspect of global chromatin dynamics requires analyzing patterns of covalent modifications on bulk histones and monitoring their modulation in response to cell stimulation. Mass spectrometry is well suited for the characterization of protein post-translational modifications (16Burlingame A.L. Boyd R.K. Gaskell S.J. Anal.

The identification of modifications by direct mass analysis is unbiased, lacking drawbacks of metabolic labeling or chemical derivatization, and enables multiple chemistries to be observed at the same time. In this study, changes in post-translational modifications on chromatin-derived histones were examined in response to treatment of resting cells with the serine-threonine phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid (OA). Cellular responses to OA include the activation of signaling transduction pathways, nuclear envelope breakdown, premature chromatin condensation, and apoptosis (21Haystead T.A. Sim A.T. Carling D.

Here, we report that histones H2A, H3, and H4 become phosphorylated after treatment with OA, but with differential kinetics, suggesting distinct regulatory mechanisms for each histone. In addition, OA leads to global deacetylation of H4 in a manner independent of phosphorylation, whereas H2A undergoes deacetylation in a manner coupled to phosphorylation. These results demonstrate the regulation of acetylation on bulk nucleosomes by phosphatase inhibition and reveal mechanisms for global modulation of covalent modification patterns in chromatin. K562 human erythroleukemia cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cells were grown in spinner cultures at 37 °C and 5% CO2 at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and penicillin. The cells were treated with varying amounts of okadaic acid (Alexis) or trichostatin-A (Wako) dissolved in Me2SO, and controls received the same volume of Me2SO without drugs. UV irradiation (244 nm) was performed for 30 s using a handheld source over 2.5 × 106cells suspended in 1 ml of medium in a 10-cm plate. Histones were isolated from 2.5 × 107 cells by acid extraction. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (2,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C), washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1 ml of buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 100 μm Na2MoO4, 1 mmNa3VO4, 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm benzamidine). Lysates were prepared by 20 strokes in a tight fitting glass/glass Dounce homogenizer, followed by three 20-s pulses of sonication on ice. Insoluble material was collected by centrifugation (17,000 ×g for 10 min), and the pellets were resuspended in buffer B (8 m urea, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100) and incubated 10 min at room temperature. After centrifugation (17,000 × g for 10 min), the loose, viscous pellet was transferred to a new tube, and 110 volume of 0.3 nHCl was added, followed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C with vortexing. The insoluble pellet was separated from the supernatant by centrifugation (17,000 × g for 10 min). Histones and chromatin-associated proteins were precipitated from the supernatant by the addition of 10 volumes of cold acetone and incubation overnight at −20 °C. The proteins were collected by centrifugation (17,000 × g for 10 min), and the pellets were lyophilized and resuspended in 100 μl of 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, plus protease inhibitors. Isolated histones were analyzed on 15% SDS-PAGE gels with Coomassie staining to verify protein integrity. In some experiments, isolated histones were treated with 20 units of calf alkaline intestinal phosphatase (Promega, with no additional buffers). Phosphatase reactions were run for 30 min at 30 °C prior to LC/MS. The samples were acidified to 1.0% (v/v) with formic acid and loaded onto POROS R120 perfusion chromatography (PerSeptive) packed in fused silica capillary columns (500 μm × 20 cm). The column eluate was directly coupled to a Perkin-Elmer Sciex API-III+ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a nebulization assisted electrospray source (LC/electrospray ionization/MS). The proteins were eluted from the column with a gradient of 0–80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid at 1% acetonitrile/min by HPLC (Applied Biosystems, Inc., model 140B) at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. LC/MS data were analyzed and deconvoluted using software provided by the manufacturer (Perkin-Elmer Sciex). The proteins were separated as described for LC/MS but instead were collected in fractions by following UV absorbance. Peaks were analyzed for the presence of histones by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Fractions containing histones were lyophilized and resuspended in 8 murea, followed by digestion with 20% (w/w) endoproteinase Asp-N (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The digestions were performed at 30 °C for 18 h, loaded onto a C-18 column, desalted, and analyzed by LC/MS. Eluted peptides were analyzed as described for proteins. Histones were enriched by acid extraction and analyzed by reversed-phase chromatography in-line with ion spray mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Detection of histones is represented in a contour plot (Fig.1), showing elution of H4, followed by co-elution of H2A and H2B (which are distinguishable by mass) and finally elution of H3. The selection of scans shown in Fig. 1 reveals a series of ions resulting from multiple charging of each protein (Fig.2).Figure 2Ion spectra of core histones. Ion spectra for histone H4 (A), co-eluting histones H2A and H2B (B), and histone H3 (C) were generated from scans indicated in Fig. 1. Each panel showsm/z versus ion intensities for major charge states indicated for each protein. Multiple ions at each charge state correspond to histone modifications. The insets forA–C show ions observed for +9, +11, and +14 charge states of H4 (1257.4), H2A (1274.0) and H2B (1253.2), and H3 (1094.8), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The observed protein masses were computationally deconvoluted from each ion series and compared with the masses predicted for histone variants (Table I). Assignments were confirmed by peptide mapping, in which individual histones were purified by reversed-phase chromatography, digested with endoproteinase Asp-N, and analyzed by LC/MS. Masses of peptides detected in digests were compared with predicted peptide masses in histone variants (Table I). In some cases, histones were found in only one form. For example, the single isoform of H4 was verified by protein and peptide mass identification. H3 exists as variants H3.1 and H3.3, both of which were consistent with observed peptide masses; however, only H3.1 was present, based on observed protein mass. Peptide masses corresponding to H2A were observed, with variant H2A.1 detected as the predominant form. H2B variants were more difficult to distinguish because of overlap in predicted peptide mass; however, the unique assignments of peptides of 2475.9 and 6385.3 Da to the protein mass of 13,773 Da and the observed protein mass of 13,817 indicate the presence of H2B.1 and H2B.F.Table IComparison of calculated and observed masses of human histone variants and peptide coverageHistoneSwiss Protein Database Accession numberCalculated mass1-aAfter removal of methionine-1; +N-terminal acetylation for H2A and H4.Observed massS.D.Number of peptides1-bExpected number of peptides after complete theoretical digest with endoproteinase Asp-N.Peptide identification number (average observed peptide mass)1-cPeptide number and observed mass matched to histone theoretical digest with endoproteinase Asp-N.H2A.1(P02261)14,00114,0041.332 (2186.6), 3 (4304.1)H2A.2(P28001)14,04532 (2186.6)H2A.M(P04908)14,08232 (2186.6)H2A.X(P16104)15,05432 (2186.6)H2A.Z(P17317)13,46251 (587.6), 3 (2114.6), 4 (504.5)1-dPeptides corresponding to H2A.Z were observed, but the full-length protein mass for this variant was not, suggesting minor abundance of H2A.Z.H2B.1(P06899)13,77313,7731.541 (2475.9), 3 (1772.0), 4 (6385.3)H2B.1A(P02278)13,77551 + 2 (2461.9), 3 (3194.7), 4 (1772.0), 5 (6401.3)H2B.2(P23527)13,77651 + 2 (2476.0), 3 (1772.0), 4 (6401.3)H2B.F(P33778)13,81913,8171.542 (3193.7), 3 (1772.0), 4 (6401.3)H3.1(P16106)15,27315,2721.552 (509.6), 4 (1911.3), 5 (1553.8)H3.3(P06351)15,19752 (509.6), 4 (1911.3), 5 (1553.8)H4(P02304)11,27811,2781.542 (5006.9), 3 (1922.2), 4 (2000.3)1-a After removal of methionine-1; +N-terminal acetylation for H2A and H4.1-b Expected number of peptides after complete theoretical digest with endoproteinase Asp-N.1-c Peptide number and observed mass matched to histone theoretical digest with endoproteinase Asp-N.1-d Peptides corresponding to H2A.Z were observed, but the full-length protein mass for this variant was not, suggesting minor abundance of H2A.Z. Open table in a new tab Post-translational modifications of histones were apparent from the MS spectra of full-length proteins (Fig. 2). For example, the spectra show ions with charges from +8 to +18 representing the “charge envelope” of H4 (Fig. 2A). An expanded view of one charge form (+11 ion; Fig. 2A, inset), shows four major ions (m/z = 1257.4, 1261.9, 1266.5, and 1274.3), indicating multiple mass forms of H4. This is confirmed by deconvoluting the MS spectrum (Fig.3A), revealing full-length masses of each form ranging from 11,200 to 11,500 Da. We interpret these data as follows. H4 exists as a single isoform, with the observed mass 11,278 ± 1.5 Da (Table I) identical to that calculated from the primary sequence, including removal of the N-terminal methionine and N-terminal acetylation of serine 1. Additional covalently modified forms of H4 are detected as methylated (11,292 Da), dimethylated (11,306 Da), methylated + acetylated (11,334 Da), dimethylated + acetylated (11,348 Da), methylated + diacetylated (11,376 Da), dimethylated + diacetylated (11,390 Da), and dimethylated + triacetylated (11,431 Da) (Fig. 3A and TableII). By noting the intensity of the major isoforms, we conclude that H4 in resting cells exists primarily in a dimethylated state (11,306 Da) and a dimethylated + monoacetylated state (11,348 Da).Table IIInterpretation of observed massesHistoneMass observedS.D.InterpretationDaDaH2A14,0041.3H2A.1 + N-Ac14,0461.3H2A.1 + N-Ac + 1K-Ac14,0831.3H2A.1 + N-Ac + 1P14,1271.3H2A.1 + N-Ac + 1K-Ac + 1PH2B13,7591.5Unknown13,7731.5H2B.113,7881.5H2B.1 + 1Me13,8171.5H2B.F13,8451.5H2B.F + 2Me13,6991.5H2B.F + 1PH315,2721.5H3.115,3021.5H3.1 + 2Me15,3151.5H3.1 + 3Me or 1K-Ac15,3281.5H3.1 + 4Me or 1K-Ac + 1Me15,3441.5H3.1 + 5Me or 1K-Ac + 2Me15,3551.5H3.1 + 6Me or 1K-Ac + 3Me or 2K-Ac15,3681.5H3.1 + 7Me or 1K-Ac + 4Me or 2K-Ac + 1Me15,3821.5H3.1 + 8Me or 1K-Ac + 5Me or 2K-Ac + 2Me or 2Me + 1P15,3991.5H3.1 + 9Me or 1K-Ac + 6Me or 2K-Ac + 3Me or 3K-Ac15,4251.5H3.1 + 11Me or 1K-Ac + 8Me or 2K-Ac + 5Me or 3K-Ac + 2Me or 1K-Ac + 2Me + 1P15,5091.5H3.1 + 17Me or 1K-Ac + 14Me or 2K-Ac + 11Me or 3K-Ac + 11Me or 4K-Ac + 3Me or 5K-Ac15,5741.5H3.1 + 22Me or 1K-Ac + 19Me or 2K-Ac + 16M or 3K-Ac + 13Me or 4K-Ac + 8Me or 5K-Ac + 2Me or 15,368 (Da) + 1P + 3K-AcH411,2781.5H4 + N-Ac11,2921.5H4 + N-Ac + 1Me11,3061.5H4 + N-Ac + 2Me11,3171.8H4 + N-Ac + 1K-Ac11,3341.5H4 + N-Ac + 1Me + 1K-Ac11,3481.5H4 + N-Ac + 2Me + 1K-Ac11,3591.8H4 + N-Ac + 2K-Ac11,3761.5H4 + N-Ac + 1Me + 2K-Ac11,3861.5H4 + N-Ac + 2Me + 1P11,3901.5H4 + N-Ac + 2Me + 2K-Ac11,4011.8H4 + N-Ac + 3K-Ac11,4311.5H4 + N-Ac + 2Me + 3K-Ac11,44432-aThis peak was detected with variable masses ranging between 11,440 and 11,449 Da in different experiments after treatment with OA and could not be assigned to specific covalent modifications.11,4751.8H4 + N-Ac + 2Me + 4K-Ac11,5161.8H4 + N-Ac + 2Me + 5K-AcN-Ac, N-terminal acetylation (+42); Me, methylation (+14); K-Ac, side chain acetylation (+42); P, phosphorylation (+BD).2-a This peak was detected with variable masses ranging between 11,440 and 11,449 Da in different experiments after treatment with OA and could not be assigned to specific covalent modifications. Open table in a new tab N-Ac, N-terminal acetylation (+42); Me, methylation (+14); K-Ac, side chain acetylation (+42); P, phosphorylation (+BD). Multiple ions at individual charge states were also seen with H2A (m/z = 1274.0,1277.9,1281.4), and H2B (m/z = 1251.8, 1253.2, 1254.4, 1257.3, 1261.9, 1264.5) (Fig. 2B, inset). As described above the major form of H2A was assigned to H2A.1 modified by N-terminal acetylation (Table II). Secondary forms of H2A.1 are acetylated or phosphorylated. H2B was detected as both H2B.1 and H2B.F isoforms by inspection of peptide and full-length protein masses. Deconvolution plots (Fig.3B, 13,759–13,899 Da) suggest that H2B.1 is the predominant form (13,773 Da) and is also methylated (13,788 Da), whereas H2B.F (13,817 Da) is less abundant and observed in unmodified, dimethylated, and phosphorylated forms (Table II). A predominant peak observed at 13,759 Da cannot be matched to any known H2B variant and may represent a unique variant present in this cell line or a stable degradation product. Modified forms of H3 were also apparent from mass spectra and deconvolution plots (Figs. 2C and 3C). The mass of 15,272 Da corresponded to the unmodified variant H3.1 and was verified by peptide mapping (Table I). In general, full-length masses increased in increments of 14 Da (Table II) and most likely reflect lysine methylation, although acetylation cannot be excluded. Mass increases were also observed that corresponded to phosphorylation of methylated and acetylated forms (15,382, 15,425, and 15,574 Da). As shown in Table II, the observed masses suggest complex patterns of covalent modification for H3. OA is a potent serine-threonine phosphatase inhibitor that alters phosphorylation of many intracellular proteins, including histones (24Cohen P. Cohen P.T. J. Biol.

K562 cells were treated with 0, 10, 100, and 1000 nm OA, spanning a lower concentration range (10–100 nm) expected to inhibit protein phosphatase 2Ain vivo and a higher range (100–1000 nm), which inhibits both protein phosphatase 2A and protein phosphatase 1 (25Cohen P.

Histones were harvested after 1 and 18 h of treatment with 0, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 nm OA (Fig.4). As mentioned above, H4 from control cells was predominantly dimethylated and N-terminal acetylated (11,306 Da). Additional forms were apparent, corresponding to further modifications by monoacetylation and diacetylation (11,348 and 11,390 Da). No significant changes in post-translational modification of H4 were seen after 1 h of OA treatment at any concentration. However, treatment for 18 h resulted in a dramatic loss of H4 acetylation, apparent at concentrations of 10 nm and higher (Fig. 4,D, F, and H). At 1000 nmOA, H4 was primarily detected in its dimethylated (11,306 Da) or dimethylated + phosphorylated forms (11,386 Da), with loss of acetylation. No peaks corresponding to monoacetylated + monophosphorylated (11,428 Da) was observed, indicating that the loss of acetylated H4 was not caused by conversion to a phosphorylated form. Furthermore, at 100 nm, deacetylation is clearly apparent prior to formation of the phosphorylated species. This indicates that deacetylation and subsequent phosphorylation events are uncoupled, such that phosphorylation occurs independently and at a later time after deacetylation. The first five residues of H4 and H2A are identical in the region surrounding the site of phosphorylation; thus it was surprising that these proteins differed with respect to dose and time dependence of phosphorylation. H2A accumulated as a +80-Da phosphorylated form after 1 h at 1000 nm OA (Fig.5G), whereas H4 was unmodified under these conditions. Increased H2A phosphorylation was observed at all concentrations of OA after 18 h (Fig. 5, B,D, F, and H, compare 14,004 Da with 14,083 Da). We also noted loss of the acetylated form (14,046 Da) and a corresponding increase in an acetylated + phosphorylated form (14,127 Da) at 10 and 100 nm OA, indicating that the acetylated species of H2A are substrates for phosphorylation. These changes suggest a faster response for H2A phosphorylation and greater sensitivity to OA, compared with H4. Next, histones from OA-treated cells were dephosphorylated in vitro with alkaline phosphatase. Phosphatase treatment led to a significant reduction in the 11,386-Da species of H4 and the 14,083- and 14,132-Da species of H2A (Fig. 6). Little change was observed using heat-inactivated phosphatase, confirming their assignments as phosphorylated forms of H4 and H2A. Post-translational modification of H2B changed little throughout the varying dosages of OA at either 1 h (data not shown) or 18 h (Fig. 7). After 18 h at 1000 nm OA, the 13,817-Da species decreased, with no detectable increase that would suggest redistribution because of covalent modification. Thus, H2B.F might be more susceptible to degradation or preferentially lost during isolation from cells treated with OA. Deconvolution plots of H3 showed major changes in post-translational modification after treating cells with 1000 nm OA for 18 h (Fig. 8). A nearly identical pattern was observed after 1 h (data not shown). Major changes in H3 included loss of intensities at 15,328, 15,344, and 15,355 Da and increased intensities at 15,472 and 15,488 Da. As described earlier, the apparent modifications on H3 were complex and difficult to interpret. Most likely, the overall shift in peak intensities to greater mass reflects H3 phosphorylation in response to phosphatase inhibition. For example, the mass at 15,488 Da may correspond to diphosphorylation of the 15,328-Da species. Many cell lines, including K562, undergo cell death after several hours of treatment with OA; thus, it was possible that the effects on histone post-translational modifications reflect chromatin modifications caused by apoptotic signaling. To examine this, histone H4 was analyzed after UV irradiation of K562 cells, which induces apoptosis without inhibiting cellular phosphatase activity. UV-induced apoptosis was monitored by microscopy, observing extensive cellular fragmentation at 10 h. The mass of H4 was unchanged after irradiation for 30 s and further incubation for 4–24 h (Fig.9). This indicates that the deacetylation and phosphorylation events in response to OA are unlikely to occur as secondary responses to apoptosis and are more likely regulated by phosphorylation-dependent events. Fig. 4 shows H4 deacetylation at 10–100 nm OA, prior to the appearance of phosphorylated H4. Intensities of unmodified, acetylated, and phosphorylated forms were quantified by summing areas under each peak, averaging results of three separate experiments (Fig. 10). The observed dose response for H4 deacetylation (IC50 = 20 nm) is 5–10-fold lower than that of H4 phosphorylation (EC50 = 200 nm), confirming that deacetylation precedes phosphorylation (Fig. 10A). In contrast, H2A globally redistributed to phosphorylated and acetylated + phosphorylated forms with little net deacetylation (Fig.10B). This result suggested that enzymes that catalyze global acetylation and/or deacetylation of H4 are controlled directly or indirectly by phosphorylation mechanisms. To examine whether either or both of these activities were affected, the cells were treated with OA in the presence or absence of the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin-A (TSA) (31Kiguchi K. Glesne D. Chubb C.H. Fujiki H. Huberman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 995-1004PubMed Google Scholar). After treatment with TSA in the absence of OA, mass forms corresponding to mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-acetylated H4 were observed (Fig. 11C,11,348, 11,390, 11,431, and11,475 Da), with the tetra-acetylated form in greatest abundance. A ladder of masses at 11,317, 11,359, 11,401, and 11,444 Da was also observed that corresponded to differentially acetylated forms of the 11,278-Da species (N-terminal acetylated and unmethylated H4). Treatment with both OA and TSA resulted in a unique pattern in which the stoichiometry of acetylation was intermediate between cells treated with either TSA or OA (Fig. 11D). Thus, OA induces global H4 deacetylation in part through inhibition of acetyltransferases. In contrast, TSA did not shift H2A to maximally acetylated forms (Fig.11G), implying that a significant amount of H2A deacetylase activity may be insensitive to this drug. Thus, effects of OA on acetylase versus deacetylase activities toward H2A could not be distinguished. Finally, no peaks corresponding to the phosphorylated H4 species were observed after TSA + OA (Fig. 11D), suggesting that phosphorylation occurs only on forms of H4 that are completely unoccupied at all N-terminal lysine residues. In contrast, H2A species show differing behavior, in which phosphorylation is preferential for deacetylated forms but still occurs to a measurable level on the monoacetylated forms (Fig. 11H). Mass spectrometry allows chemistries and stoichiometries of protein modifications to be readily characterized on intact proteins. Our study identifies acetylation, phosphorylation, and methylation as predominant modifications of bulk H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, in agreement with literature reports (reviewed in Refs. 1Van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar and 2Wolffe A.P. Chromatin Structure and Function. Academic Press, New York1995Google Scholar). Significantly, we observe complex changes in chemical modification of H2A, H3, and H4 in response to treatment of cells with OA, indicating that global covalent modifications of histones respond to regulation of cellular serine/threonine phosphatases. In particular, marked changes in histone acetylation provide evidence that mechanisms facilitating acetylation and deacetylation of chromatin-bound histones can be globally regulated by phosphorylation. Core histone subtypes were assigned to each of the observed full-length polypeptide masses by peptide mapping. By matching unique peptide masses with intensities of full-length masses in deconvolution plots, we identified H4 and variants H2A.1, H2B.1, H2B.F, and H3.1 in K562 cells. N-terminal peptides from histones H2A.1, H3, or H4 were not detected, indicating that the N termini of these histones are likely to be covalently modified. Previous mapping studies have shown that the acetylation of nucleosomal H4 occurs at lysines 5, 8, 12, and 16 (1). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that these residues represent the major sites for lysine acetylation in our samples that primarily represent monoacetylated and diacetylated species under control conditions. Likewise, previous mapping identified serine 1 as the main phosphorylated residue on H4, and this site is most likely occupied in the 11,083-Da form. H4 acetylation at lysines 5 and 12 and phosphorylation of serine 1 have been suggested to be cytoplasmic events occurring on free histones (32Jackson V. Granner D. Chalkley R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2266-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 33Ruiz-Carrillo A. Wangh L.J. Allfrey V.G. Science. 1975; 190: 117-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 34Sung M.T. Dixon G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 1616-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 35Woodland H.R. Dev. Biol. 1979; 68: 360-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, our isolation procedure involves precipitation of DNA-associated proteins; therefore the phosphorylation and deacetylation events we observe occur on chromatin. Treatment of cells with OA resulted in phosphorylation of H4, reaching stoichiometries of nearly 0.5 mol/mol. An unexpected finding was that OA also caused a substantial loss of H4 acetylation. This implies that global histone deacetylation can be regulated in vivo by phosphorylation-dependent pathways. The absence of H4 species that were both phosphorylated and acetylated indicated that phosphorylation only occurs on deacetylated H4; therefore deacetylation precedes phosphorylation. Furthermore, deacetylation of H4 is 10-fold more sensitive to OA than phosphorylation (Fig. 10), indicating that the two events are uncoupled and that the deacetylation event is not driven by a shift in equilibrium to phosphorylated H4. Thus, OA appears to increase the net rate of deacetylation of bulk histone. Conceivably this could be caused by decreased action of histone acetyltransferases, increased action of histone deacetylases, or both. Therefore the possibility that OA influences histone deacetylase activity was examined by treating cells with TSA, which inhibits most nucleosomal histone deacetylase enzymes. TSA shifted nearly all of the H4 protein to a tetra-acetylated form, which we ascribe to full occupancy at lysines 5, 8, 12, and 16. This implies that most if not all HDAC enzymes responsible for global H4 deacetylation are TSA-sensitive. Importantly, OA treatment reduced the stoichiometry of TSA-induced H4 acetylation to approximately equal distributions of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 mol/mol. This provides information about enzymatic regulation, because if the sole effect of OA were to enhance deacetylase activity with no effect on acetyltransferase activity, then the degree of acetylation induced by TSA should be unaffected by OA. The accumulation of intermediately acetylated forms suggests that at least part of the OA effect is due to phosphatase-dependent inhibition of H4 acetyltransferase activity. Acetylated forms of H2A were also observed in resting cells, which decreased following OA treatment. However, the behavior of H2A and H4 differed significantly. First, mass forms corresponding to phosphorylated as well as acetylated + phosphorylated H2A appeared after OA treatment, with little net deacetylation of H2A in response to OA. This indicates that acetylated H2A is a substrate for phosphorylation, whereas acetylated H4 is not. Second, the kinetics of H2A versus H4 modification differed, such that phosphorylated forms of H2A were apparent 1 h after OA, whereas at the same drug concentration, phosphorylated H4 was observed only after 18 h. Finally, under conditions where H2A becomes completely phosphorylated in response to OA, H4 is only 50% phosphorylated. The differences in behavior between H2A and H4 was unexpected given the sequence conservation between the two proteins at their known sites of phosphorylation. The sites of phosphorylation in H2A and H4 reportedin vivo occur at serine 1 (34Sung M.T. Dixon G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1970; 67: 1616-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This residue occurs within the sequence Ac-NH-Ser-Gly-Arg-Gly-Lys-5, which is conserved in H4 and H2A.1. It is thus likely that H2A and H4 are targeted by the same kinases. Thus, the more rapid response of H2A phosphorylation could reflect a greater accessibility of H2A in chromatin, compared with H4. For example, all acetylated forms of H2A may be accessible to protein kinases, whereas deacetylation events may be necessary to increase accessibility of H4. In summary, distinct patterns of post-translational modifications on nucleosomal histones reveal mechanisms for phosphatase-dependent control of global acetyltransferase and deacetylase activities, as well as differences in accessibility of individual histones to protein kinases."

Several plants with significantly decreased PSI-G protein content were identified. Plants with reduced PSI-G content were indistinguishable from wild type when grown under optimal conditions, despite a 40% reduction of photosystem I. This decrease of photosystem I was correlated with a similar reduction in state transitions. Surprisingly, the reduced photosystem I content was compensated for by a more effective photosystem I because the light-dependent reduction of NADP+in vitro was 48% higher. Photosystem I antenna size determined from flash-induced P700 absorption changes did not reveal any significant effect on the size of the photosystem I antenna in the absence of PSI-G, whereas a 17% reduction was seen in the absence of PSI-K. However, nondenaturing green gels revealed that the interaction between photosystem I and the light-harvesting complex I was less stable in the absence of PSI-G. Thus, PSI-G plays a role in stabilizing the binding of the peripheral antenna. The increased activity in the absence of PSI-G suggests that PSI-G could have an important role in regulation of photosystem I. PSI-G is a subunit of photosystem I in eukaryotes.

PSI from higher plants is a supramolecular complex consisting of at least 17 different polypeptides located in the nonappressed thylakoid membranes (1Scheller H.V. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Lunde C. Knoetzel J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 41-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The core of PSI consists of at least 13 different subunits (A−N). The PSI-A and PSI-B subunits are homologous and form a heterodimer, which binds the primary electron donor P700 (a chlorophyll dimer) and the electron acceptors A0 (a chlorophyll amolecule), A1 (a phylloquinone), and Fx (a [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur cluster) (1Scheller H.V. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Lunde C. Knoetzel J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1507: 41-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 2Golbeck J.H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol.

The remaining cofactors, FA and FB (both [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur clusters), are bound to PSI-C. The other subunits of PSI do not bind electron acceptors. In PSI of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, the PSI-A/B dimer, together with some of the smaller membrane-intrinsic subunits, binds the 90 Chl a and 22 β-carotene molecules that constitutes the core antenna system (3Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar). The subunits PSI-G, PSI-H, and PSI-N are unique to higher plants and algae, and their structure and exact position in the PSI complex are therefore not known. LHCI is also specific for higher plants and algae. This peripheral antenna is arranged around the core and is, at least in higher plants, composed of the products of four nuclear genes,Lhca1–4, with molecular masses of 20–24 kDa. LHCI binds about 100 chlorophyll a and b molecules and ∼20 xanthophyll molecules per P700 (4Lam E. Ortiz W. Malkin R. FEBS Lett. 1984; 168: 10-14Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 5Bassi R. Simpson D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 163: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Lhca1 and Lhca4 form heterodimers, whereas Lhca3 and Lhca2 may form homodimers (6Knoetzel J. Svendsen I.

Plant Physiol. 1996; 12: 409-420Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and it has recently been shown that the complexes only bind to the core complex at the side of the PSI-F/J subunits (10Boekema E.J. Jensen P.E. Schlodde E. van Breemen J.F.L. van Roon H. Scheller H.V. Dekker J.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). PSI-G and PSI-K from eukaryotic phototrophs show significant sequence similarity (11Kjærulff S. Andersen B. Skovgaard Nielsen V. Lindberg Møller B. Okkels J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18912-18916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A comparison of PSI-G and PSI-K fromArabidopsis displays ∼30% amino acid identity. In fact, the cyanobacterial PSI-K is equally similar to plant PSI-G and PSI-K. However, cyanobacterial PSI contains only one copy of PSI-K (3Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linking of plant PSI showed that PSI-G and PSI-K differed from all the other small PSI subunits by not forming cross-linking products with other small core subunits (9Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 12: 409-420Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This suggested that both subunits should be located away from the 2-fold symmetry axis. The location of PSI-K in cyanobacterial PSI agrees with this location (3Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar). PSI-K has recently been shown to interact with Lhca2 and Lhca3 using plants in which the psaK gene was suppressed using antisense technology (12Jensen P.E. Gilpin M. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24701-24708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The role of PSI-G in plants and its location in the PSI complex are unknown, but a putative cross-linking product between PSI-G and Lhca2 has been reported (9Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 12: 409-420Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, due to the homology between PSI-G and PSI-K and because light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins are only present in plants and green algae, a function of PSI-G in the interaction with LHCI is likely. To investigate the role of PSI-G, we transformed Arabidopsisplants with a psaG cDNA in antisense orientation under the control of a constitutive promoter. Transformants with no or very low levels of PSI-G protein were obtained, and the plants were analyzed at both the biochemical and leaf level. Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heyn cv. Columbia was used for all experiments. Plants were grown in peat in a controlled environment Arabidopsis Chamber (Percival AR-60L, Boone, IA) at a photosynthetic flux of 100–120 μmol photons m−2 s−1, 20 °C, and 70% relative humidity. The photoperiod was 12 h for plants used for transformation, whereas the photoperiod was 8 h for plants used for biochemical and physiological analysis to suppress the induction of flowering. A 550-bp fragment containing the entire coding region of PSI-G was amplified from a full-length cDNA clone (279G1T7; Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center DNA Stock Center, Columbus, OH) by PCR using primers based on a genomic sequence for the PsaG gene (GenBankTM accession number AC002328). The fragment was cloned in antisense orientation between the enhanced cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter and 35S terminator in the pPS48 vector (13Kay R. Shan A. Daly M. McPherson J. Science. 1987; 236: 1299-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar,14Odell J.T. Nagy F. Chua N.-H. Nature. 1985; 313: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), and orientation of the insert was confirmed by sequencing. Subsequently, a fragment containing the enhanced 35S promoter followed by the antisense PsaG gene and the 35S terminator was excised with XbaI and ligated into the binary vector pPZP111 (15Hajdukiewicz P. Svab Z. Maliga P. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 989-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar). The vector construct was transformed by electroporation (16Wen-Jun S. Forde B.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 178385Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) intoAgrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 (17Zambryski P. Joos H. Genetello C. Leemans J. Van Montagu M. Schell J. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2143-2150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Arabidopsis plants were transformed by the floral dip method using Silwet l-77 (Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX) (18Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Seeds harvested from transformed plants were germinated on MS medium (Sigma) containing 2% sucrose, 50 mg liter−1 kanamycin sulfate, and 0.8% agar for 2 weeks, and kanamycin-resistantArabidopsis plants were selected. Seedlings were then transplanted to peat. All biochemical and physiological experiments were performed with fully expanded rosette leaves harvested before bolting. Leaves from 8–10-week-old plants were used for isolation of thylakoids as described previously (19Haldrup A. Naver H. Scheller H.V. Plant J. 1999; 17: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Total Chl and Chla/b ratio in thylakoids were determined in 80% acetone according to the method of Lichtenthaler (20Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-382Crossref Scopus (9261) Google Scholar). For preparation of PSI complexes, thylakoid membranes (1 mg Chl ml−1) were solubilized for 10 min with 1% dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Sigma) at 0 °C. After centrifugation (5 min, 20,000 ×g), aliquots of the supernatant were applied on sucrose gradients. The sucrose gradients were prepared by freezing and subsequent thawing at 4 °C of 11 ml of 0.4 m sucrose, 20 mm Tricine-NaOH (pH 7.5), and 0.06% dodecyl-β-d-maltoside. The gradients were centrifuged for 20 h at 285,000 × g. The PSI band was collected with a syringe, and its protein composition was analyzed by fully denaturing SDS-PAGE. For pigment analysis, PSI-200 were extracted with 80% acetone under dim green light. The pigment composition was analyzed using a Dionex HPLC system with a Waters Spherisorb Analytical Column, ODS1 (250 × 4.6-mm inner diameter; 5-μm particle size). The mobile phase consisted of two solvents, A (acetonitrile/methanol/water (84:9:7)) and B (methanol/ethyl acetate (68:32)), both of which contained 0.1% triethylamin. The pigments were eluted with a linear gradient from 100% solvent A to 100% solvent B over 10 min, followed by an isocratic elution with 100% solvent B for 5 min, and a linear gradient of 100% solvent B to 100% solvent A in 1 min. The column was regenerated with 100% solvent A for 20 min before injection of the next sample. Injection volume was 80 μl, the flow rate was 1 ml min−1, and the eluate was monitored using a photodiode array detector in the range 290–595 nm. Pigments were identified by comparing retention times and absorption spectra with standard pigments (VKI, Hørsholm, Denmark). Quantification was performed by integration of the elution peaks at 445 nm using the program Chromeleon version 6 (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA). Plants lacking the PSI-G subunit were identified by immunoblotting. Crude leaf extracts were prepared, and immunoblotting was carried out as described previously (12Jensen P.E. Gilpin M. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24701-24708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Isolated thylakoids were analyzed in similar immunoblotting procedures using antibodies as indicated in the figure legends. Primary antibodies were detected using a chemiluminescence detection system (ECL; Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. NADP+ photoreduction activity of PSI was determined from the absorbance change at 340 nm as described by Naveret al. (21Naver H. Scott M.P. Golbeck J.H. Møller B.L. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8996-9001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using thylakoids equivalent to 5 μg of Chl. Thylakoids were solubilized in 0.1%n-decyl-β-d-maltopyranoside before the measurement. Flash-induced P700 absorption change was measured at 834 nm, essentially as described previously (21Naver H. Scott M.P. Golbeck J.H. Møller B.L. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8996-9001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Tjus S.E. Møller B.L. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The saturating actinic pulse (532 nm, 6 ns) was produced by a Nd:YAG laser (Quanta Ray model GCR-100; Spectra Physics, Mountain View, CA). Thylakoids (32 μg Chl ml−1) were dissolved in 300 μl of 20 mm Tricine (pH 7.5), 40 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgCl2, 0.1%n-decyl-β-d-maltopyranoside, 2 mmsodium ascorbate, and 20 μm 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol. The solution was centrifuged for 50 s at 200 × gto remove starch grains before measurement. The sample (300 μl) was transferred to a cuvette with 1-cm path length. A diode laser provided the measuring beam, which was detected using a photodiode. A total of 16–64 flash-induced P700 absorption changes were collected and averaged for each sample. Photo-oxidizable P700 content was calculated from the absorption change at 834 nm using an extinction coefficient of 5000 m−1 cm−1 (23Matis P. Setif P. Isr. J. Chem. 1981; 21: 316-320Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Total P700 content was determined from the ferricyanide oxidized minus ascorbate reduced difference spectrum using an extinction coefficient of 64,000m−1 cm−1 at 700 nm. State transitions were measured with a pulse amplitude 101–103 fluorometer (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) as outlined in Jensen et al. (12Jensen P.E. Gilpin M. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24701-24708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and Lunde et al. (24Lunde C. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. Nature. 2000; 408: 613-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The relative change in fluorescence was calculated as Fr = ((Fi′ − Fi) − (Fii′ − Fii))/(Fi′ − Fi). Fluorescence emission spectra at 77 K were recorded from 650 to 800 nm using an excitation wavelength of 435 nm and a bifurcated light guide connected to the spectrofluorometer. Intact leaves were dark-adapted for 30 min before measurement. Nondenaturing green gel electrophoresis was carried out as described by Knoetzel and Simpson (25Knoetzel J. Simpson D.J. Planta. 1991; 185: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), except that a Mini-Protean II electrophoresis cell (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was used for the separation of pigment proteins. A total of 110 kanamycin-resistant plants derived from the original transformed plants were screened by immunoblotting analysis of total leaf protein extracts (data not shown). Approximately one-third of these had either no detectable PSI-G protein or significantly reduced amounts of PSI-G. The detection limit was about 3% of wild type levels of PSI-G. Under the growth conditions used, there was no obvious visible difference between plants lacking PSI-G and the wild type, and plants without PSI-G had a normal life cycle and produced seeds. Plants were screened by immunoblotting for the presence of PSI-G before further analysis. All experiments were performed with plants or thylakoids that had either no detectable PSI-G protein or <8% residual PSI-G protein. Several independent lines were analyzed to rule out any effects from position of the inserted transfer DNA. In thylakoids from plants with no detectable PSI-G or reduced amounts of PSI-G, the Chl a/b ratio was 2.76 ± 0.08 (±S.D.; n = 12), whereas in wild type plants, the ratio was 2.83 ± 0.09 (±S.D.; n = 6) (TableI). Although this difference is not significant, it suggests that plants without PSI-G have a lower PSI/PSII ratio or an increased peripheral antenna.Table IChlorophyll composition of thylakoids and PSI-200 from plants devoid of PSI-G or PSI-K compared to wild typeWild typeNo PSI-GNo PSI-KThylakoidsChla/b ratio2.83 ± 0.092.76 ± 0.083.20 ± 0.151-aValue is significantly different (p < 0.05) from the wild type value.PSI-200Chla/b ratio9.0 ± 0.29.1 ± 0.610.6 ± 0.31-aValue is significantly different (p < 0.05) from the wild type value.PSI-200Chl b11.1 ± 0.211.0 ± 0.89.4 ± 0.31-aValue is significantly different (p < 0.05) from the wild type value.The Chl a/b ratio in thylakoids was determined spectroscopically (20Lichtenthaler H.K.

The numbers are significantly different (p < 0.0001). The increased Chl/P700 ratio compared with the wild type corresponds to 40% less PSI in plants with reduced content of PSI-G. This result contrasts with the 17% decrease in the Chl/P700 ratio in plants without PSI-K (12Jensen P.E. Gilpin M. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24701-24708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, the absence of PSI-G or PSI-K clearly leads to different compensatory responses. To visualize directly on the protein level that plants with reduced amounts of PSI-G have a lower content of the PSI subunits and also to analyze changes in the amounts of antenna proteins, immunoblotting analysis of thylakoid proteins was performed (Fig.1). The lanes on the gel were loaded with proteins corresponding to equal amounts of chlorophyll. Generally, the thylakoids with reduced amounts of PSI-G have ∼21–40% less of most PSI subunits (Fig. 1A). This number is in good agreement with the 40% lower P700 content observed in the same thylakoids. A trace of PSI-G protein corresponding to ∼8% of wild type is evident in the lane with thylakoids from the antisense plants. The immunoblot analysis with the PSII antibodies (D1, PSII-W, and PSII-S) shows that the amount of PSII is similar to the amounts found in wild type or slightly increased. The PSI antenna proteins Lhca1 and Lhca4 are reduced by ∼5–10%, whereas the Lhca2 and Lhca3 proteins are reduced slightly more. The PSII antenna proteins Lhcb1–4 are either unaffected or increased (Fig. 1B). As already shown in Fig. 1, the thylakoid preparation used contains residual PSI-G protein. In the different preparations of thylakoids and plants used throughout this study, the residual PSI-G content was estimated to be either below the detection limit (3% or less) or 8% of wild type level. If PSI-G affects the stability of the PSI complex, then one would expect an enrichment of PSI containing PSI-G during preparation of PSI-200 particles. To analyze this, thylakoids containing 8% PSI-G were solubilized using dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and the resulting complexes were separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The PSI-200 enriched fraction was analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting (Fig. 2), and the chlorophyll composition was analyzed by HPLC (Table I). From Fig. 2, it is clear that an enrichment of PSI-200 particles containing PSI-G is not taking place because the residual PSI-G protein in the particles corresponds to the amount of PSI-G in the thylakoids. The chlorophyll analysis also clearly shows that PSI-200 particles with a peripheral antenna very similar to wild type are purified. Thus, under the solubilization conditions used in this experiment, the PSI complexes without PSI-G are stable with respect to antenna proteins and pigments. To analyze whether PSI-G has any effect on electron transfer, NADP+ photoreduction was determined using thylakoids purified from plants without PSI-G and wild type plants. With thylakoids from wild type plants, an activity of 33.1 ± 2.3 μmol NADPH s−1 (μmol P700)−1 (±S.E.;n = 9) was determined, and with thylakoids devoid of PSI-G, an activity of 49.1 ± 6.2 (±S.E.; n = 9) was determined. These values are significantly different (p < 0.02). Hence, the activity is 48% higher in the absence of PSI-G. The relatively high standard deviation on the measurements performed on thylakoids devoid of PSI-G is related to the varying amounts of residual PSI-G protein in the preparations used. To analyze the role of PSI-G in antenna function, fluorescence emission at 77 K after excitation at 435 nm was recorded. The fluorescence emission spectra using thylakoids of both wild type and plants devoid of PSI-G are shown in Fig. 3. The spectra revealed a consistent 1-nm blue-shift from 734 nm to 733 nm in plants lacking PSI-G, which could suggest that the interaction between LHCI and the PSI core is affected in the absence of PSI-G. The 1-nm blue-shift was also seen when measurements were performed on intact leaves but was not seen when measurements were performed on purified PSI-200 (results not shown). To investigate the antenna function further, the PSI antenna size was estimated by determining P700 absorption changes as a function of flash intensity. The excitation laser flash was initially set at saturating intensity to ensure quantitative excitation of all P700, and the intensity was then successively lowered with the use of neutral gray filters. At each flash intensity, the amplitude of P700 absorption change was monitored (Fig. 4). We have previously demonstrated that plants devoid of PSI-K have less Lhca2 and Lhca3 and are impaired in energy transfer from the peripheral antenna to the core (12Jensen P.E. Gilpin M. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24701-24708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to estimate the actual antenna size in thylakoid samples from plants devoid of PSI-K as well (Fig. 4). To estimate the relative antenna cross-section, the light response curves were fitted to a single hit Poisson distribution (A(I) = Asat × (1 − exp(−kI)), where A(I) is the signal at the given flash intensity, Asat is the maximum signal with a saturating flash, I is the flash intensity, and k is the relative antenna cross-section). With this analysis, it was shown that the cross-section of PSI in the absence of PSI-K was 17.6 ± 10.7% (±S.D.; n = 8) smaller than that in the wild type (p = 0.001). In good agreement with this reduction in functional antenna size, the content of Chlb, which is only found in the peripheral antenna, is 15–16% lower in the absence of PSI-K. In contrast with these differences in antenna composition and function in the absence of PSI-K, the P700 light saturation curve for thylakoids devoid of PSI-G is essentially identical to that of the wild type (Fig. 4), and the Chlb content of PSI-200 particles devoid of PSI-G also does not differ from that of the wild type (Table I). Therefore, we conclude that PSI-G has no direct effect on the PSI antenna. Furthermore, PSI-G and PSI-K have very different effects on PSI, despite their homology.Figure 4Light-saturation curves for P700 oxidation in thylakoids devoid of PSI-G or PSI-K compared with wild type. The curves were acquired by flashing cuvettes containing mildly solubilized thylakoids with laser light of varying intensity and measuring the resulting P700 oxidation. The absorbances are plotted relative to saturation (ΔAsat = 100). Each point is the average obtained with seven to eight thylakoid samples. For clarity, the error bars have been omitted, but the standard errors were less than 2% for all points.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Pigment·protein complexes were solubilized from wild type, PSI-G-less, and PSI-K-less thylakoid membranes using octylglucoside and separated by nondenaturing green gel electrophoresis. This separation revealed seven major pigment·protein complexes in the wild type (Fig.5). PSI including LHCI is kept in its intact form in the green band called CPI* (PSI reaction center with light-harvesting complexes), whereas the PSII-associated antenna proteins are separated into trimeric LHCII, CP47, CP43, and LHC monomers consisting of CP29, CP26, CP24, and monomeric LHCII. Plants devoid of PSI-G had reduced amounts of PSI complexes in a green band that migrates with the same eletrophoretic mobility as wild type CPI*. In addition, a PSI band with significantly higher eletrophoretic mobility appears, indicating that PSI complexes devoid of PSI-G have lost light-harvesting proteins, probably due to their instability during electrophoresis in the absence of PSI-G. The behavior of PSI devoid of PSI-K is quite different from that of PSI devoid of PSI-G (Fig. 5). Apparently, the absence of PSI-G causes greater instability of the complex during electrophoresis in this system than the absence of PSI-K. State 1-state 2 transitions are a dynamic mechanism that enables plants to respond rapidly to changes in illumination and involve the dissociation of a mobile pool of the LHCII from PSII and concomitant association of this LHCII with PSI. State transitions are detected as differential changes in fluorescence at room temperature from PSII in leaves that are exposed to alternating PSII and PSI light, i.e. blue light or blue light together with far-red light (Fig. 6). Expressed as relative fluorescence changes (Fr), plants devoid of PSI-G have only 45% of the state transitions observed in the wild type plants. Thus, the capacity for redistribution of absorbed excitation energy between the two photosystems is significantly reduced in plants without PSI-G. We have successfully produced Arabidopsis plants with highly reduced or no detectable PSI-G protein using the antisense technique and thereby obtained an important source for investigating the role of the PSI-G protein in vivo as well as in vitro. PSI-G has been suggested to be positioned on the periphery of the PSI core and has therefore been suggested to interact with the peripheral antenna (9Jansson S. Andersen B. Scheller H.V. Plant Physiol. 1996; 12: 409-420Crossref Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, the data presented here clearly demonstrate that PSI-G is not required for function of the PSI antenna. The antenna size measurements obtained using flash-induced P700 oxidation showed that the functional size of the peripheral antenna was unaffected in the absence of PSI-G, whereas in the absence of PSI-K, a clear reduction in antenna size was measured. This is further supported by the pigment analysis of PSI-200 particles, in which a clear decrease in Chl b content was seen in the absence of PSI-K, and no change was seen in the absence of PSI-G. However, this is somewhat in contrast to the separation of the protein·pigments complexes by mildly denaturing gel electrophoresis (green gels), in which samples from plants devoid of PSI-G revealed reduced amounts of PSI·LHCI complexes (CPI*) and the appearance of a new green band with higher electrophoretic mobility at the same time. The appearance of this second PSI band indicates that Lhca proteins are lost from the PSI holocomplex, most probably due to a destabilization of the structural organization of the antenna in the absence of PSI-G. A similar but not as pronounced effect is observed in samples from plants without PSI-K. Although the absence of PSI-G caused a destabilization of PSI under the mildly denaturing conditions of the green gels, there is no indication that PSI was destabilized in vivo or during the preparation of PSI with nonionic detergents. In leaves and thylakoids from plants lacking PSI-G, the low-temperature fluorescence emission spectra revealed a 1-nm blue-shift in the far-red emission peak from 734 nm to 733 nm. The fluorescence emission peak at 734 nm in plants is thought to arise from the Lhca1/Lhca4 dimer (8Schmid V.H.R. Cammarata K.V. Bruns B.U. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7667-7672Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and apparently binding of the dimer to the reaction center core rather than heterodimerization gives rise to the far-red fluorescence (26Knoetzel J. Bossmann B. Grimme L.H. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 339-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,27Ihalainen J.A. Gobets B. Sznee K. Brazzoli M. Croce R. Bassi R. van Grondelle R. Korppi-Tommola J.E.I. Dekker J.P. Biochemstry. 2000; 39: 8625-8631Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, when any of the four Lhca proteins are completely missing or unable to interact with PSI, a large blue-shift of about 7 nm is seen (28Zhang H. Goodman H.M. Jansson S. Plant Physiol. 1997; 115: 1525-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 29Haldrup A. Simpson D.J. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31211-31218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 30Ganateg U. Strand Å. Gustafsson P. Jansson S. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, a blue-shift in the long-wavelength fluorescence emission should indicate that the interaction between the Lhca complexes and the PSI core is perturbed. However, no blue-shift was found in the purified PSI-200 particles devoid of PSI-G. This suggests that the blue-shift observed in thylakoids and intact leaves lacking PSI-G is due to fluorescence from Lhca complexes that are not bound to the core. The immunoblotting analysis indicates a 20–40% decrease in the amounts of most PSI core subunits. A similar reduction in the amounts of the Lhca2 and Lhca3 subunits in the absence of PSI-G was also observed. However, the Lhca1 and Lhca4 proteins were only reduced by 10%. Thus, Lhca1·Lhca4 complexes that are not connected with a PSI core are present, and this will result in fluorescence emission that is more blue-shifted than that seen when all the LHCI complexes are connected. It is known that deficiency in PSI does not necessarily lead to a similar deficiency in LHCI because the barley mutant viridis-zb63, which contains less than 5% of the PSI core proteins, still accumulates wild type amounts of the LHCI complexes (31Nielsen V.S. Scheller H.V. Møller B.L. Physiol. Plant. 1996; 98: 637-644Crossref Google Scholar). In the case of PSI-K, a clear reduction in the amounts of Lhca2 and Lhca3 was shown by immunoblot analysis, and this correlated with a 2-nm blue-shift, although there was no significant change in the amounts of Lhca1/Lhca4 (12Jensen P.E. Gilpin M. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24701-24708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This can be explained by the fact that the Lhca complexes are located on one side of the PSI core (10Boekema E.J. Jensen P.E. Schlodde E. van Breemen J.F.L. van Roon H. Scheller H.V. Dekker J.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and are thereby in contact with each other. Thus, a change in the binding environment of one of the antenna complexes is likely to affect the fluorescence properties of the other. In the absence of PSI-G, the situation is more subtle because the more severe destabilization during green gel electrophoresis suggests an interaction, whereas functional antenna size, Chl b content, and the low-temperature fluorescence data do not support a role for PSI-G in direct contact with the peripheral antenna. The data presented demonstrate that PSI-G is not required for attachment of the Lhca complexes to the core. The amount of PSI was reduced by 40% in the absence of PSI-G. This was independently verified by the state transition measurements, in which plants with reduced PSI-G content had ∼55% less state 1-state 2 transition than did the wild type. Thus, the energy distribution to PSI at the expense of PSII is significantly reduced in these plants. PSI is required for state transitions (32Delosme R. Olive J. Wollman F.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 150-158Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar); hence, the lower amount of PSI in the absence of PSI-G explains the decreased capacity for redistribution of absorbed energy. The absence of PSI-G has a positive effect on electron transport because the in vitro NADP+ photoreduction was stimulated by 48% in thylakoids with reduced amounts of PSI-G. Removal of PSI-N, PSI-H, or PSI-L results in a less efficient PSI, and the plants compensate for this by increasing the amount of PSI, whereby a normal phenotype is maintained at least under optimal growth conditions (19Haldrup A. Naver H. Scheller H.V. Plant J. 1999; 17: 689-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 24Lunde C. Jensen P.E. Haldrup A. Knoetzel J. Scheller H.V. Nature. 2000; 408: 613-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 33Naver H. Haldrup A. Scheller H.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10784-10789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This is explained by a mechanism in which the amounts of the two photosystems will adjust individually to maintain optimal electron transport. Plants with a reduced amount of PSI-G have 40% less PSI but display a normal phenotype under our growth conditions. This can be explained if PSI in the absence of PSI-G is more efficient and is supported by the higher in vitro PSI activity measured in the absence of PSI-G. Under light-limited conditions, it would not be possible to significantly increase the efficiency of PSI electron transport. However, under high irradiance levels when PSII photoprotective thermal dissipation is engaged, PSI will be absorbing many more photons than it is receiving electrons from PSII. Thus, PSI will have to deal with this excess excitation energy. One way is cyclic electron flow around PSI, but the capacity of this pathway is modest in comparison with the excess photon load when zeaxanthin/ΔpH-dependent energy dissipation is fully engaged in PSII (34Ort D.R. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The oxidized primary donor of PSI, P700+, is a strong quencher of excited states in the PSI antenna and can accumulate when PSI photochemistry outpaces PSII. We suggest that PSI-G plays an important role in this process. PSI-G is present in one copy per P700, and it is assumed that PSI-G is always attached to PSI. If PSI-G has a regulatory role, it will have to be able to execute this function while attached to the core complex. One hypothesis is that PSI-G changes conformation in response to changes in light quantity/quality or changes in pH and that this conformational change results in increased electron transfer to ferredoxin. Under normal conditions, PSI-G will maintain the electron transfer rate through PSI at a level that is below the potential maximum rate, but the amounts of the two photosystems will have been adjusted to maintain optimal electron transport. In high light or under other photoinhibitory conditions, PSI-G changes conformation and thereby allows higher electron transfer rates via more efficient electron transfer to ferredoxin. This will lead to overoxidation of P700, and P700+ will be the prevailing species. P700+ will stay oxidized until an electron arrives from PSII and will act as an efficient quencher of excitation energy in PSI. Thus, the role of PSI-G could be to shift PSI back and forth between a normal working mode and a quenching mode. This means that the PSI-G antisense plants will be in constant quenching mode. If this hypothesis is correct, then PSI without PSI-G should be better protected against PSI photoinhibition but would be more poorly adapted to variations in light intensity. Another way that PSI-G could affect PSI activity would be to uncouple at least part of the peripheral antenna, whereby excess excitation energy is prevented from reaching the core antenna and reaction center. In this way, PSI-G could perhaps be thought to cause a nonphotochemical de-excitation of pigments. However, no difference in PSI cross-section was found under almost the same conditions of solubilization at which an increased NADP+ reduction was seen. Hence, we think that PSI-G most likely acts on electron transport rather than on light harvesting. The mechanism behind the conformational change or uncoupling in response to light or pH changes is not known. This will require detailed knowledge about putative interactions with pigments (carotenoids and/or Chl a) and the location of PSI-G in the PSI complex. In conclusion, PSI-G and PSI-K are integral membrane proteins of 11 and 9 kDa, respectively. The two eukaryotic subunits are equally similar to the cyanobacterial PSI-K subunit, and they have clearly evolved from the same ancestral protein. However, the functions of the two proteins in higher plants are quite different. PSI-K has a role in interaction with Lhca2 and Lhca3, whereas PSI-G does not have an important role in interaction with the peripheral antenna. PSI-G is not necessary for attachment of the light-harvesting complexes to the core and is probably not in direct contact with LHCI. More importantly, PSI-G seems to regulate PSI electron transport, and this could be important for photoprotection of PSI. Future investigations will focus on this aspect of PSI-G with a dynamic role in PSI and on the molecular mechanism by which PSI-G exerts its proposed function.

In this report, we further characterize the interaction between RanBP2 and Ubc9 and provide evidence that Ubc9's distribution across the nuclear membrane, nuclear versus cytoplasmic, is important in controlling the subcellular localization of SUMOs and/or SUMOlated proteins, the assembly of PML bodies, and the homologous recombination process mediated by Rad51.

Expression and purification of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein were carried out as described previously (24Saitoh H. Sparrow D.B. Shiomi T., Pu, R.T. Nishimoto T. Mohun T.J. Dasso M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). X. laevis egg extracts were prepared as described previously (23Saitoh H., Pu, R. Cavenagh M. Dasso M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3736-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). COS-7 cell lysates were prepared as described below. Standard binding conditions were as follows: 300 μl of egg/cell extract was incubated with gentle rocking for 20 min at 4 °C with 20 μl of the glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) pre-absorbed with appropriate GST fusion protein. The beads and proteins associated with them were precipitated by low speed centrifugation. After washing the beads four times with 700 μl of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.05% Tween 20, 50 μl of SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol) was added and incubated for 5 min at 90 °C. The eluted proteins were separated on a 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and visualized by silver or Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Immunoblot analyses were carried out as described previously (1Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Approximately 108of COS-7 or BHK cells were harvested by gentle trypsin treatment and lysed with gentle homogenization in 2 ml of PBS containing 0.005% digitonin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). After centrifugation, the soluble fraction was incubated with 2 μg of antibody and 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) at 4 °C for 1 h. The collected beads were washed four times with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, then proteins associated with the beads were analyzed on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels and visualized by silver staining. COS-7 or BHK cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). In Fig. 6 (see below), ∼48 h after transfection, 5 μg/ml mitomycin C, 5 μg/ml etoposide, 5 μg/ml aphidicolin, and 50 μg/ml α-amanitin (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) were added to the culture medium and incubated for 2 h, respectively. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and methanol at −20 °C for 2 min. For the detection of NPC-associated proteins, cells were permeabilized in 0.005% digitonin in PBS on ice for 5 min and washed twice in ice-cold PBS before fixation with paraformaldehyde and methanol. Conditions of the primary- and secondary-antibody incubations were described previously (1Saitoh H. Hinchey J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6252-6258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Fluorescence images were analyzed with an Olympus system microscope Model BX60 (Olympus, Melville, NY) using the MetaMorph imaging system (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA). Quantitation of fluorescence described below (see Fig. 2 E) was also performed using the MetaMorph system. Micrographs were arranged with Adobe Photoshop, version 3.0 or 5.0 (Adobe Systems, Mountainview, CA).Figure 2The cytoplasmic overexpression of GFP-IR1+2 sequesters the nuclear Ubc9 to the cytoplasm. A, endogenous Ubc9 accumulates in the nucleus and is concentrates at the NPC. COS-7 cells were grown on coverslips. Prior to fixation, the cells were incubated with either PBS (a) or PBS containing 0.005% digitonin (b) for 5 min, and then processed for immunofluorescence using an anti-Ubc9 monoclonal antibody.B, Ubc9-GFP targets to the nucleus and the NPC. COS-7 cells were transfected with the Ubc9-GFP (a and b) or the GFP construct (c and d). The transfected cells were incubated with PBS (a and c) or PBS containing 0.005% digitonin (b and d) for 5 min before fixation. Green fluorescence was observed by fluorescence microscopy. C, nuclear morphology of the GFP-IR1+2-expressing cells appears intact. COS-7 cells were transfected with the GFP-IR1+2 construct and grown on two coverslips for 48 h. The cells were fixed and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole to visualize the nuclear morphology (b). The cell expressing the GFP-IR1+2 fusion protein was detected in the green fluorescence channel (a). D, Ubc9 mislocalizes in the GFP-IR1+2-expressing cells. COS-7 cells transfected with the GFP-IR1+2 construct were fixed and subjected to an indirect immunofluorescence analysis using anti-Ubc9 mouse monoclonal antibody (b andd). In c and d, the cells were treated with 0.005% digitonin before fixation. The cell expressing the GFP-IR1+2 fusion protein was detected in the green fluorescence channel (a and c). Because GFP-IR1+2 can be extracted efficiently by the digitonin, the residual green fluorescence is barely seen after the digitonin treatment (c). In the upper panels (a and b), there are three cells in the field; one is transfected and expressing GFP-IR1+2 (bottom right), and the others are non-transfected cells. In thelower panels (c and d), there are two cells; one is transfected and expressing GFP-IR1+2 (bottom right), and the other is a non-transfected cell (top left). E, the nuclear Ubc9 is sequestered in the cytoplasm in GFP-IR1+2-expressing cells. The nuclear and the NPC-associated Ubc9 contents were quantified by measuring the level of fluorescence produced by an anti-Ubc9 antibody. The pixels within the nucleus (left side) and around the NPC (right side) were counted, and the integrated signal intensities produced by the anti-Ubc9 antibody were measured. f.u., fluorescence units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The basic local alignment search tool algorithm (BLAST 2.1), BLAST 2 sequence program (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and the PEST-Find algorithm (www.at.embnet.org/ embnet/tools/bio/PESTfind/) were used. We reported previously that the nucleoporin RanBP2 interacts with Ubc9 via a 241-amino acid region (amino acids 2596–2836) on RanBP2 (24Saitoh H. Sparrow D.B. Shiomi T., Pu, R.T. Nishimoto T. Mohun T.J. Dasso M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 121-124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This domain was referred to as an IR domain by Yokoyama et al.(25Yokoyama N. Hayashi N. Seki T. Pante N. Ohba T. Nishii K. Kuma K. Hayashida T. Miyata T. Aebi U. Fukui M. Nishimoto T. Nature. 1995; 376: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) who originally identified two internalrepeat units within this region (Figs.1, A and B). To further dissect the IR domain, GST pull-down assays were carried out using five GST fusion protein constructs. These constructs contained internal repeat unit 1 (GST-IR1), internal repeat unit 2 (GST-IR2), the region between IR1 and IR2 (GST-M), the region containing both internal repeats (GST-IR1+2) and the entire IR domain (GST-IR), respectively (Fig. 1 A). GST protein was used as a negative control. The GST fusion proteins were incubated with Xenopus egg extracts or COS-7 cell lysates followed by pull down and immunoblot assays to detect association with Ubc9. We found that Ubc9 was abundant in both the GST-IR and GST-IR1+2 pull-down fractions, but very little was in the GST-IR1, GST-IR2, and GST-M fractions (Fig. 1, A andC, and data not shown). Interestingly, we observed the SUMOlated form of RanGAP1 in the GST-IR fraction but not in the GST-IR1+2 fraction (Fig. 1, A and C, and data not shown), suggesting that the binding domain for Ubc9 can be dissected from the binding domain for SUMOlated RanGAP1 on RanBP2. Taken together, these results indicate that IR1+2 might contain the binding module specific for Ubc9. To address whether the interaction between IR1+2 and Ubc9 is direct, we performed GST pull-down assays using GST-IR1+2 and purified recombinant Ubc9. As shown in Fig. 1 D, Ubc9 co-precipitated with GST-IR1+2 but not with GST, indicating that Ubc9 can bind directly to IR1+2 without requiring additional cellular factors. Next, we made a mammalian expression construct of IR1+2 tagged at its N terminus with GFP (GFP-IR1+2) to test whether IR1+2 interacts with Ubc9in vivo. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with either the GFP-IR1+2 or the GFP construct, and the cells were cultured for 48 h. Under our experimental conditions, equivalent amounts of GFP-IR1+2 and GFP were expressed (Fig. 1 E). After harvesting the cells, total cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis using an anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 1 F). A GFP-IR1+2 band (∼45 kDa) and a co-precipitated 18 kDa band, which was recognized by anti-Ubc9 antibody, were detected in the GFP-IR1+2-transfected cell extracts, whereas Ubc9 was not detected in the GFP-transfected cell extracts. These results indicate that a significant amount of endogenous Ubc9 interacts very tightly with the exogenously expressed GFP-IR1+2 via the IR1+2 domain in vivo. Yeast two-hybrid assays identified more than 30 different proteins that can interact with Ubc9. Many of these proteins contain PEST sequences (4Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 14Kim Y.H. Choi C.Y. Kim Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12350-12355Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to look for PEST sequences in IR1+2. Using the PEST-Find algorithm (see “Experimental Procedures”), we found a region containing a PEST element in internal repeat 1 of IR1+2 (amino acids 2664–2681) (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that IR1+2 might have biochemical properties similar to those of PEST-containing Ubc9-interacting proteins. Some E2 ubiquitin carrier proteins interact with E3 ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligases via a RING (reallyinteresting new gene) finger motif (28Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar) or a HECT (homologous to E6-APCterminus) domain (29Jackson P.K. Eldridge A.G. Freed E. Furstenthal L. Hsu J.Y. Kaiser B.K. Reimann J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 429-439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). In the case of Ubr1, which is a unique E3 ubiquitin ligase in the amino-terminal end rule pathway, a BRR (basicresidue-rich) region is involved in the interaction with an E2-ubiquitin carrier protein (30Xie Y. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6832-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Thus, we were interested to learn whether IR1+2 contains such motifs/domains. Neither RING-finger, HECT domain, nor BRR regions were detected within the IR1+2 domain, suggesting that the mechanism by which RanBP2 interacts with Ubc9 might be distinct from previously characterized E2·E3 interactions in the ubiquitin and amino-terminal end rule pathways. The immunoprecipitation experiment shown in Fig.1 F suggests that a significant amount of the endogenous Ubc9 forms a stable complex with exogenously expressed GFP-IR1+2 in vivo. To investigate the subcellular localization of the GFP-IR1+2·Ubc9 complex, we performed indirect immunofluorescence analyses. As shown in Fig. 2 D, both GFP-IR1+2 and Ubc9 were detected abundantly in the cytoplasm but were barely detected in the nucleus, suggesting that the complex is primarily cytoplasmic. Because immunofluorescence microscopy on the non-transfected COS-7 cells detected the endogenous Ubc9 predominantly in the nucleus (Fig. 2 A, panel a), the formation of the GFP-IR1+2·Ubc9 complex in the cytoplasm might result in sequestration of the nuclear Ubc9 in the cytoplasm. The nuclear Ubc9 content was quantified by measuring the level of fluorescence produced by the anti-Ubc9 antibody. The pixels within the nucleus (Fig.2 D, panel b) were counted, and the integrated signal intensities of the anti-Ubc9 antibody were measured. The measurements revealed that ∼90% of the nuclear Ubc9 was sequestered in the cytoplasm in the GFP-IR1+2-expressing cells (Fig.2 E). It had been reported that Ubc9 is concentrated not only inside of the nucleus but also at the NPC in vertebrate cells (4Melchior F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 591-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar,10Tashiro K. Pando M.P. Kanegae Y. Wamsley P.M. Inoue S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In support of these observations, our immunofluorescence analysis of non-transfected COS-7 cells revealed that Ubc9 exists predominantly in the nucleus and also at the nuclear rim/NPC (Fig.2 A, panel a). As shown in Fig. 2 A(panel b), the NPC staining was most apparent when the cells were permeabilized with 0.005% digitonin before fixation and labeling. Because digitonin preferentially solubilizes the cholesterol-rich plasma membrane but does not extract the nuclear membrane, many soluble cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic proteins, including the nucleoplasmic Ubc9, are extracted efficiently with the digitonin treatment, whereas the proteins associated with insoluble materials such as the nuclear membrane/NPC remains intact. Furthermore, the nuclear and NPC localization of Ubc9 was also demonstrated by the transient expression of Ubc9 tagged at its C terminus with GFP (Ubc9-GFP) in COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 2 B, when cells were transfected with the Ubc9-GFP construct, the green fluorescence was detected both in the nucleus and at the NPC. Taken together, these data support the previous observations that Ubc9 localizes both at the NPC and within the nucleus. Interestingly, we found that, in contrast to the marked mislocalization of the nuclear pool of Ubc9 (Fig. 2, D (panels aand b) and E), the localization of NPC-associated Ubc9 wa"

Glycine mutations that interrupt the Gly-X-Y repetitive amino acid sequence that forms the characteristic collagen triple helix have been defined in four families; however, the effects of these mutations on collagen VI biosynthesis, assembly, and structure have not been determined. In this study, we examined the consequences of Bethlem myopathy triple helical glycine mutations in the α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains, as well as engineered α3(VI) triple helical glycine mutations. Although the Bethlem myopathy and introduced mutations that are toward the N terminus of the triple helix did not measurably affect collagen VI intracellular monomer, dimer, or tetramer assembly, or secretion, the introduced mutation toward the C terminus of the helix severely impaired association of the mutant α3(VI) chain with α1(VI) and α2(VI). Association of the three chains was not completely prevented, however; and some non-disulfide bonded tetramers were secreted. Examination of the secreted Bethlem myopathy and engineered mutant collagen VI by negative staining electron microscopy revealed the striking finding that in all the cell lines a significant proportion of the tetramers contained a kink in the supercoiled triple helical region. Collagen VI tetramers from all of the mutant cell lines also showed a reduced ability to form microfibrils. These results provide the first evidence of the biosynthetic consequences of collagen VI triple helical glycine mutations and indicate that Bethlem myopathy results not only from the synthesis of reduced amounts of structurally normal protein but also from the presence of mutant collagen VI in the extracellular matrix.

Association of the three genetically distinct subunits, α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI), to form a triple helical monomer is followed by antiparallel, staggered assembly into disulfide-bonded dimers, which then align to form tetramers, also stabilized by disulfide bonds. Outside of the cell, tetramers, the secreted form of collagen VI, associate end-to-end to form the characteristic beaded microfibrils.

Single amino acid substitutions that interrupt the Gly-X-Y amino acid repeat region that forms the characteristic collagen triple helix have been identified in all three genes (10Pepe G. Bertini E.

These glycine mutations are not randomly distributed along the triple helix, but are all within the first 50 amino acids at the N-terminal end of the helix. Only one mutation outside of the triple helix has been reported, a Gly to Glu substitution at amino acid 1679 of the α3(VI) chain (12Sasaki T. Hohenester E. Zhang R.-Z. Gotta S. Speer M.C. Tandan R.

This mutation is in the N2 subdomain, one of the 10 α3(VI) globular N-terminal subdomains that show homology to the type A domains of von Willebrand factor. The discovery that heterozygous mutations in any one of the three subunits of collagen VI can cause Bethlem myopathy revealed the critical role of this protein in the muscle extracellular matrix and raised a number of important questions about the consequences of collagen VI mutations on the biosynthesis, assembly, and structure of collagen VI and its interactions in the extracellular matrix. Some of the Bethlem myopathy mutations, including a premature stop codon in the α1(VI) chain and the deletion of α1(VI) exon 14, result in the secretion of reduced amounts of structurally normal collagen VI (7Lamandé S.R.

In this study, we examine the biosynthetic and structural consequences of Bethlem myopathy and engineered glycine mutations within the triple helical domains of the α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI) chains. Detailed clinical descriptions of the two Bethlem myopathy families included in this study have been published previously (4Jobsis G.J. Boers J.M. Barth P.G. de Visser M. Brain. 1999; 122: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The mutations in these families are heterozygous point mutations leading to α1(VI) G286V and α2(VI) G250S substitutions (11Jobsis G.J. Keizers H. Vreijling J.P. de Visser M. Speer M.C. Wolterman R.A. Baas F. Bolhuis P.A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Both mutations are within the collagen VI triple helical domain. To allow the positions of these mutations to be readily compared with the introduced α3(VI) mutations also described in this study, we refer to these mutations as α1(VI) G49V and α2(VI) G16S, respectively, to indicate the position of the mutations relative to the start of the triple helical domain (Fig. 1). Two α3(VI) cDNA expression constructs containing glycine substitutions within the triple helical domain were produced using strand overlap extension PCR (13Horton R.M. Pease L. McPherson M.J. Directed Mutagenesis. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1991: 217-247Google Scholar). To introduce a Gly to Ala mutation at residue 49 of the triple helix, bases 5708–5895 (domains N9-C5, ATG at base 256 (14Chu M.L. Zhang R.Z. Pan T.C. Stokes D. Conway D. Kuo H.J. Glanville R.

The overlapping primers each contained two nucleotide substitutions that resulted in the G49A mutation (GGC-GCA). These primary amplification products were gel-purified, and 100 ng of each was used as the template in a second round of overlapping PCR. The resulting PCR product (bases 5708–6098) was digested with SacII and XhoI and used to replace the corresponding fragment of a 2.2-kilobase α3(VI)SacII-Bst1107I subclone. Similarly, a Gly to Val mutation at residue 301 of the triple helix was introduced by PCR amplification of bases 6204–6651 and 6631–7422 in which the overlapping primers contained the G301V (GGC-GTG) change. The second round overlapping PCR product (bases 6204–7422) was digested withMluNI and ligated into the 2.2-kilobaseSacII-Bst1107I subclone. Finally, the 1.7-kilobase SacII-Eco47III fragment of the α3(VI) N6-C5 plasmid (15Lamandé S.R. Sigalas E. Pan T.-C. Chu M.-L. Dziadek M. Timpl R. Bateman J.F. J. Biol.

To confirm the sequence changes and ensure that no errors had been introduced during PCR and cloning, the mutant constructs were transcribed and translated in vitro (TNT®, Promega), and the regions generated by PCR were sequenced (AmpliCycleTM, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (data not shown). Human dermal fibroblasts were established from skin biopsies (11Jobsis G.J. Keizers H. Vreijling J.P. de Visser M. Speer M.C. Wolterman R.A. Baas F. Bolhuis P.A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), and the human osteosarcoma cell line, SaOS-2 (ATCC HTB-85), was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Cell cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum as described previously (16Bateman J.F. Mascara T. Chan D. Cole W.G. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). SaOS-2 cells were transfected with the α3(VI) cDNA expression constructs using LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Stably transfected cells were selected in growth medium containing 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen), and individual G418-resistant colonies were isolated and expanded into cell lines. G418 was removed from the culture medium after the fourth passage. Primary skin fibroblasts and SaOS-2 cells were grown to confluence in 10-cm2 dishes, incubated overnight in the presence of 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate, and then biosynthetically labeled for 18 h with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Tran35S-label 1032 Ci/mmol, ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) in 750 μl of methionine-free and serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate. The medium was removed to a sterile tube, and protease inhibitors were added to the following final concentrations: 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide, and 5 mm EDTA. The cell layer was solubilized in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, and 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide (cell lysis buffer). Cell lysates and medium samples were clarified by centrifugation, made up to 800 μl with cell lysis buffer, and passed through a 0.45-μm filter (Millipore). Fibronectin, which co-immunoprecipitates with collagen VI and co-migrates with the α3(VI) chain on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, was removed by gelatin-Sepharose chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). The column buffer was 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (NET buffer). Collagen VI in the column flow-through was immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C using the α3(VI) monoclonal antibody 3C4 (17Engvall E. Hessle H. Klier G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and 100 μl of 20% protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The protein A-Sepharose beads were washed twice with NET buffer and then once with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min each. Immunoprecipitated collagen VI was eluted into gel loading buffer at 65 °C for 15 min and analyzed following reduction with 25 mm dithiothreitol by SDS-PAGE on 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels. Collagen VI triple helical monomers, dimers, and tetramers were analyzed on 2.4% (w/v) acrylamide, 0.5% (w/v) agarose composite gels under non-reducing conditions as described previously (7Lamandé S.R.

Cole W.G. Biochem. J. 1984; 217: 103-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) or imaged using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, STORMTM). Confluent human fibroblasts and SaOS-2 cultures in 80-cm2 flasks were incubated for 18 h in 10 ml of serum-free medium containing 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate. The medium was collected; the protease inhibitors described earlier were added, and sodium azide was included at a final concentration of 0.1% (w/v). Culture medium was clarified by centrifugation, adsorbed onto carbon-coated grids for 1 min, washed with water, and stained with 0.75% uranyl formate. The grids were rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge in air, and samples were observed in a Jeol 1200 EX electron microscope operated at 60 kV accelerating voltage. Human fibroblasts and SaOS-2 cells were grown to confluence in 8-well chamber glass slides (Nunc) and then supplemented daily for up to 15 days with 0.25 mmsodium ascorbate. Cell layers were washed with PBS,1 fixed with 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min, and then air-dried. Slides were preincubated with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with either the collagen VI antibody 3C4 in PBS or PBS alone for 1 h. Bound antibody was detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig (Silenus). Slides were mounted in FluorSaveTM reagent (Calbiochem) and then viewed and photographed using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. SaOS-2 cells were grown to confluence in 175-cm2 flasks and then incubated overnight in 10 ml of serum-free medium containing 0.25 mm sodium ascorbate. The medium was collected, and 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride and 20 mmN-ethylmaleimide were added. Samples were clarified by centrifugation and then dialyzed overnight against 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl. Aliquots of the medium (500 μl) were either applied directly to a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) or first digested for 2 h at 37 °C with 20 μg of collagenase (Worthington, CLS-2) in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2. The digestion was terminated by the addition of 20 mm EDTA. The Superose 6 column was run at 0.5 ml/min in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. Column fractions were dotted onto nitrocellulose membrane and collagen VI α3(VI) chains detected using the monoclonal antibody 3C4. Bound antibody was detected using an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody and an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences). The x-ray films were scanned (Bio-Rad, GS-800 Calibrated Densitometer) to determine the relative amount of collagen VI in each fraction. To examine the biosynthetic consequences of disease-causing glycine mutations within the triple helical domain of collagen VI, control fibroblasts and fibroblasts from patients with an α1(VI) G49V and an α2(VI) G16S mutation were labeled overnight with [35S]methionine. Collagen VI in the cell and medium fractions were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. All of the collagen VI subunits, α1(VI), α2(VI), and α3(VI), produced by the Bethlem myopathy fibroblasts migrated normally and were efficiently secreted into the medium (Fig. 2a, lanes 1–6). Total production of collagen VI was comparable in control and patient cultures (Fig. 2a) suggesting that the mutant chains were able to fold correctly and were not targeted for intracellular degradation. The normal pathway of collagen VI intracellular assembly involves the formation of triple helical monomers containing all three chains, then disulfide-bonded dimers (6 chains), and then tetramers (12 chains) which are secreted from the cell. Analysis of collagen VI on non-reducing gels demonstrated that in both control and Bethlem myopathy cultures, collagen VI tetramers were the major secreted form (Fig. 2b, lanes 2, 4, 6, and8), and collagen VI monomers and dimers did not accumulate within the Bethlem myopathy cells (Fig. 2b, lanes 1, 3, and 5). Taken together, these data indicate that the triple helical glycine mutations do not disturb chain association and folding of the triple helix, the formation of disulfide-bonded dimers and tetramers, or secretion of the mutant-containing molecules from the cell. To examine the effect of these mutations on the formation of a collagen VI extracellular matrix, fibroblasts were grown for 8 days post-confluence in the presence of sodium ascorbate, stained with a collagen VI antibody, and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Control and Bethlem myopathy cultures all deposited an extracellular matrix containing collagen VI (Fig. 3), suggesting that over the 8-day culture period tetramers containing mutant chains were able to be stably incorporated into the matrix. Although we were unable to detect any changes in collagen VI biosynthesis, assembly, secretion, or matrix deposition in the Bethlem myopathy fibroblasts, the possibility that the heterozygous mutations have subtle effects that were masked by the presence of structurally normal collagen VI could not be excluded. To explore further the effects of collagen VI triple helical glycine mutations on assembly and secretion of the protein, two α3(VI) cDNA expression constructs were produced by site-directed mutagenesis and stably expressed in SaOS-2 cells. SaOS-2 cells transcribe α1(VI) and α2(VI) mRNAs at levels comparable with that of skin fibroblasts but do not synthesize α3(VI) mRNA and produce no stable collagen VI protein (15Lamandé S.R.

Normal collagen VI biosynthesis and matrix deposition can be restored in these cells by stable transfection with an α3(VI) cDNA construct encoding protein domains N6-C5 (15Lamandé S.R. Sigalas E.

The first α3(VI) expression construct contained a Gly to Ala mutation at amino acid 49 of the triple helix (α3(VI) G49A) and was designed to mimic the reported Bethlem myopathy glycine mutations that are all localized toward the N terminus of the triple helix (Fig. 1) (10Pepe G. Bertini E. Giusti B. Brunelli T. Comeglio P. Saitta B. Merlini L. Chu M.-L. Federici G. Abbate R. Neuromusc.

In the second construct the mutation was toward the C-terminal end of the triple helix, a Gly to Val substitution at amino acid 301 (α3(VI) G301V). Both constructs encoded α3(VI) protein domains N6-C5. Stably transfected clonal SaOS-2 cell lines expressing the control construct α3(VI) N6-C5 and the two mutant constructs α3(VI) N6-C5 G49A and α3(VI) N6-C5 G301V were biosynthetically labeled overnight, and collagen VI in the cell and medium fractions were immunoprecipitated with the α3(VI)-specific antibody 3C4 and analyzed under reducing conditions on 5% polyacrylamide gels as before. In both control cells and cells expressing the α3(VI) G49A chain, α1(VI) and α2(VI) were co-immunoprecipitated with the α3(VI) chain, and all three chains were efficiently secreted (Fig.4a, lanes 1–4). Analysis under non-reducing conditions clearly demonstrated the presence of collagen VI tetramers in the cell and medium of the α3(VI) G49A cells (Fig. 4b, lanes 3 and 4), indicating that intracellular assembly and secretion proceed normally, even when all of the collagen VI monomers contain an α3(VI) chain with an N-terminal triple helical glycine mutation. In contrast, co-immunoprecipitation of α1(VI) and α2(VI) chains was poor in both the cell and medium of α3(VI) G301V-expressing cells despite an abundance of α3(VI) (Fig.4a, lanes 5 and 6), suggesting that this C-terminal helical mutation severely disrupted assembly of the mutant α3(VI) chain with endogenous α1(VI) and α2(VI). The major protein band seen under non-reducing conditions was the α3(VI) chain (Fig.4b, lanes 5 and 6), consistent with the large excess of α3(VI) seen under reducing conditions (Fig. 4a, lanes 5 and 6). Disulfide bonded monomers and dimers were present in both the cell and medium fractions, but disulfide-bonded tetramers were not observed (Fig. 4b, lanes 5 and6). This was a consistent finding in three separate experiments. Previous studies (9Lamandé S.R. Shields K.A. Kornberg A.J. Shield L.K. Bateman J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21817-21822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) in both human fibroblasts and SaOS-2 cells have shown that when collagen VI monomers contain a chain with a deletion in the triple helix that prevents dimer and tetramer formation, the monomers are retained within the cell and are not secreted. The presence of disulfide-bonded monomers and dimers in the medium of α3(VI) G301V-expressing cells raised the possibility that tetramers were indeed assembled within these cells, allowing them to be secreted, but these tetramers were not disulfide-bonded and so dissociated under the denaturing gel electrophoresis conditions. To explore this possibility, the medium from control cells and cells expressing α3(VI) G49A and α3(VI) G301V chains was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography under non-denaturing and non-reducing conditions. Column fractions were dotted onto nitrocellulose and α3(VI) chains detected using the 3C4 antibody. The medium from all three cell lines contained high molecular weight α3(VI)-reactive material that eluted in the void volume (Fig. 5). An additional, later eluting peak was present in the medium of both control cells and cells expressing α3(VI) G301V chains. This material eluted at the same position as purified recombinant α3(VI) N6-C5 chains (18Wiberg C. Hedbom E. Khairulla A. Lamandé S.R. Oldberg A. Timpl R. Morgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18947-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and is consistent with the excess undisulfide-bonded α3(VI) seen on unreduced gels (Fig. 4b, lane 6). To assess the assembly state of the high molecular weight collagen VI secreted by α3(VI) G301V-expressing cells, aliquots of the medium were digested with bacterial collagenase and then analyzed by gel filtration chromatography as before. Individual collagen chains and collagen triple helical molecules are cleaved into small peptides by bacterial collagenase; however, collagen VI tetramers are resistant to bacterial collagenase digestion (19Bruns R.R. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1984; 89: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20Spissinger T. Engel J. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 499-505Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As expected, the free α3(VI) chains seen in undigested medium from control and α3(VI) G301V cells were removed by collagenase digestion (Fig. 5, a andc). The collagen VI eluting in the void volume, however, was resistant to collagenase, not only in the control and α3(VI) G49A medium but also in the α3(VI) G301V medium (Fig. 5), suggesting that tetramers were assembled and secreted by all three cell lines. Together with the electrophoretic data (Fig. 4), this led to the conclusion that the α3(VI) G301V mutation affected collagen VI intracellular assembly in two ways. First, assembly of the mutant chains with α1(VI) and α2(VI) was severely compromised but not completely prevented. Second, whereas the mutation did not prevent the formation of tetramers, the disulfide bonds that normally stabilize the tetramers were unable to form. To determine whether tetramers containing the α3(VI) G49A and G301V mutations were able to form a collagen VI extracellular matrix, transfected SaOS-2 cells were grown for 15 days post-confluence in the presence of sodium ascorbate and stained with the 3C4 antibody. A collagen VI extracellular matrix that was uniformly distributed over the cells was seen in both control and α3(VI) G49A cultures (Fig.6, a and b), suggesting that the α3(VI) G49A mutation did not prevent the end-to-end assembly of tetramers to form microfibrils. Extracellular collagen VI staining was also seen in α3(VI) G301V cultures; however, the staining was not evenly distributed over the cells, and only small localized patches were observed, one of which is shown (Fig.6c). This uneven, patchy matrix staining is most likely a consequence of the small amount of collagen VI that is assembled and secreted by the α3(VI) G301V cells, and its presence suggests that the undisulfide-bonded tetramers secreted by these cells are able to assemble into microfibrils. To visualize the collagen VI tetramers secreted by the SaOS-2 α3(VI) G301V cells, and to quantify microfibril formation, medium from the transfected SaOS-2 cells and control and Bethlem myopathy fibroblasts was examined by negative staining electron microscopy. Although this analysis confirmed the presence of collagen VI tetramers in the medium of α3(VI) G301V cells, the most striking finding was that a significant proportion of the usually linear tetramers contained a kink, approximately one-third of the way along the supercoiled triple helical domain (Fig. 7G). Examination of SaOS-2 α3(VI) G49A and the Bethlem myopathy culture medium demonstrated that these cells also produced kinked tetramers (Fig. 7, A and C–F). Kinked tetramers were not seen in either control fibroblasts or control SaOS-2 cells. The kinks were approximately the same distance along the supercoiled domain i"

Frangione B. Rostagno A. Mead S. Revesz T. Plant G. Ghiso J. Nature. 1999; 399: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). A 34-amino acid peptide, termed ABri, generated by endoproteolytic processing of this mutant precursor protein is deposited in the brains of FBD patients (2Vidal R. Frangione B. Rostagno A. Mead S.

Interestingly, a different genetic defect of theBRI2 gene was found in another rare, autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disease, familial Danish dementia (FDD) (7Vidal R. Revesz T. Rostagno A. Kim E. Holton J.L. Bek T. Bojsen-Moller M. Braendgaard H. Plant G. Ghiso J. Frangione B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4920-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Clinical symptoms of FDD include progressive development of cataracts and hearing impairments as well as other neurological symptoms and dementia. The BRI2 mutation in FDD is the presence of a 10-nucleotide (TTTAATTTGT) duplication between codons 265 and 266, just prior to the normal termination codon. This decamer duplication leads to the loss of serine 266 and a change in the reading frame to generate an 11-amino acid longer protein (BRI-D) that has a unique C-terminal sequence. The resulting C-terminal 34-amino acid peptide, termed ADan, is the major component of insoluble amyloid fibrils in brains of FDD patients (7Vidal R. Revesz T. Rostagno A. Kim E. Holton J.L. Bek T. Bojsen-Moller M. Braendgaard H. Plant G. Ghiso J. Frangione B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4920-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Thus, ABri and ADan peptides have the same length and identical N-terminal amino acid sequence (first 22 residues), but the C-terminal 12 amino acids are different. We previously demonstrated that BRI is a type II integral membrane protein and that both wild type BRI and the FBD-associated mutant BRI-L, are processed by furin between amino acids 243 and 244, resulting in the production of C-terminal ∼3 kDa wild type and ∼4 kDa ABri peptides, respectively, which are released into the conditioned medium (8Kim S.H. Wang R. Gordon D.J. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Lynn D.G. Thinakaran G. Meredith S.C. Sisodia S.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 984-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Notably, secretion of ABri peptide derived from the mutant BRI-L precursor is enhanced compared with that of peptide generated from wild type BRI, suggesting that the C-terminal eleven amino acids extension in mutant BRI-L effects furin-mediated proteolysis in a dominant fashion. Although furin is necessary and sufficient for the endoproteolysis of BRI and BRI-L in our cellular model, the fact that the sequence N-terminal to the scissile bond, ···KGIQKR is an atypical furin recognition sequence (9Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) provoked us to examine the potential role of other members of the subtilisin/kexin-like proprotein convertase (PC) family in the processing of BRI and BRI-L. Seven members of PC family have been identified including furin, PC1 (or PC3), PC2, PC4, PACE4, PC5 (or PC6; two isoforms of PC6A and PC6B), and PC7 (or LPC/PC8) (9Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar, 10Molloy S.S. Anderson E.D. Jean F. Thomas G.

Of these PCs, we chose to assay furin, PACE4, PC6A, PC6B, and LPC, because they are ubiquitously expressed in peripheral tissues and brain and are active in the constitutive secretory pathway (12Day R.

Chretien M. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), but their activity is restricted to the regulated secretory pathway. Expression of PC4 is restricted to gonadal tissues (16Seidah N.G. Day R. Hamelin J. Gaspar A. Collard M.W. Chretien M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1559-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and therefore is not relevant for this study. In this report, we have analyzed the effects of the selected PCs on BRI processing and examined the potential differences in proteolytic processing of wild type BRI, FBD-associated mutant BRI-L, and FDD-associated mutant BRI-D. We now report that furin is most efficient in endoproteolysis of BRI and BRI-L; other PCs including PACE4, PC6A, PC6B, and LPC show much lower activities. Interestingly, LPC, like furin, also exhibits enhanced cleavage of BRI-L compared with wild type BRI but PC6A cleaves wild type and mutant molecules with similar efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the newly described Danish variant, “BRI-D” is also processed by furin and, like BRI-L, the furin cleavage of BRI-D is more efficient than that of wild type BRI. Interestingly, while the ABri peptide is detected both intracellularly and in the medium of transfected cells, the ADan peptide accumulates predominantly in intracellular compartments. pRK5-BRI and pRK5-BRI-L constructs that encode APLP1-tagged BRI and BRI-L, respectively, were described previously (8Kim S.H.

The insert from this plasmid was liberated with HindIII and XbaI and subcloned into the ecdysone inducible expression vector pIND (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California).

Mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells were maintained in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and 50% of OptiMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Furin-defective RPE.40 cells were cultured in F12 medium (Invitrogen) with 5% FBS and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS. Cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) for 5–6 h with 2 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA double-banded on CsCl-EtBr gradients and analyzed after 48 h. To generate stable cells coexpressing α1-PDX and BRI or BRI-L, EcR293 cells (Invitrogen), which constitutively express ecdysone receptor, were cotransfected with pIND-α1-PDX and pRK5-BRI or pRK5-BRI-L using the calcium phosphate method. Cells expressing transgene were selected with 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). To induce the expression of α1-PDX, cells were treated with indicated concentrations of muristerone A (Invitrogen) for 48 h. Cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with protease inhibitors mixture (a mixture of AEBSF, pepstatin A, E-64, bestain, leupeptin, and aprotinin; Sigma). Conditioned medium was collected and immediately adjusted to 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates or conditioned medium were subject to 10% Tris/glycine or 16.5% Tris/Tricine SDS-PAGE (20Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10527) Google Scholar), and fractionated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell). The membrane was blocked by incubation with 10% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.15% Tween 20 (PBS-T). The membrane was then probed with primary antibody for 2 h and then horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Pierce, Rockford, IL) for 1 h. Between steps, the blot was extensively washed with PBS-T for 30 min. The immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For metabolic labeling, cells were starved in cysteine-free DMEM for 30 min and then labeled with 200 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) supplemented with 1% dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen) for 2 h. Conditioned medium was collected, and cells were lysed in IP buffer. For pulse-chase experiments, parallel plates of HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with BRI, BRI-L, or BRI-DcDNAs. Transfected cells were starved for 30 min in cysteine-free DMEM and then labeled with 250 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine for 2 h. At the end of the labeling period, one dish from each set was immediately lysed in IP buffer, while the remaining dishes were washed once and incubated for various periods of time in DMEM containing 1% dialyzed FBS and 1 mm l-cysteine (Invitrogen). At each chase time point, the conditioned medium was collected, and the cell monolayers were lysed in IP buffer. Immunoprecipitations were performed with respective antibodies at 4 °C overnight as described (8Kim S.H. Wang R. Gordon D.J. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Lynn D.G. Thinakaran G. Meredith S.C. Sisodia S.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 984-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), and immune complexes were collected with protein A-conjugated agarose beads (Pierce) and eluted by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli SDS sample buffer. After separation on 10% Tris/glycine or 16.5% Tris/Tricine gel (20Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10527) Google Scholar), radioactive bands were visualized and quantitated using a Phosphorimager (Molecular Dynamics). We previously demonstrated that furin is necessary and sufficient for the endoproteolytic processing of the type II membrane proteins, BRI and BRI-L (8Kim S.H. Wang R. Gordon D.J. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Lynn D.G. Thinakaran G. Meredith S.C. Sisodia S.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 984-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, the sequence N-terminal to the scissile bond of BRI and BRI-L, ···KGIQKR is an atypical furin recognition sequence (9Nakayama K. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) and hence, it was conceivable that other members of the subtilisin/kexin-like PC family may also play a role in processing BRI and BRI-L. To assess the specificity of furin processing, we first examined the effects of α1-antitrypsin Portland (α1-PDX), a bioengineered furin inhibitor, on the processing of BRI. This inhibitor contains a furin consensus motif in its reactive site loop (Ala355-Ile-Pro-Met358 →Arg355-Ile-Pro-Arg358) (17Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A.J. Thomas G. Proc.

Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We generated a stable HEK293 cell line that coexpresses BRI-L harboring an N-terminal Myc tag and a C-terminal CT11 tag and an ecdysone-inducible, FLAG-tagged α1-PDX polypeptide. In this stable cell line, α1-PDX was readily inducible with an increasing dose of muristerone A (Fig.1A, upper panel); as the level of this inhibitor was increased, both the N-terminal fragment of BRI-L (Fig. 1A, lower panel) and secreted ABri peptides (Fig. 1B) were markedly reduced. Instead, full-length BRI-L accumulated as a function of α1-PDX expression (Fig. 1A, middle panel). Similar inhibitory effects of α1-PDX were also observed for wild type BRI (data not shown). These results indicate that α1-PDX is capable of inhibiting the protease involved in the processing of BRI and BRI-L. Although α1-PDX was initially designed as a specific furin inhibitor, several reports have shown that α1-PDX also inhibits the activity of other members of PC family to different extents (17Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar,21Benjannet S. Savaria D. Laslop A.

To more directly examine the potential role of other members of the PC family, particularly those expressed in brain, in the processing of BRI and BRI-L, we coexpressed APP (control), furin, PACE4, PC6A, PC6B, or LPC (18Creemers J.W. Ines Dominguez D. Plets E. Serneels L. Taylor N.A. Multhaup G. Craessaerts K. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Biol.

RPE.40 cells do not express functional furin (22Moehring J.M. Moehring T.J. Infect. Immun. 1983; 41: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Moehring J.M. Inocencio N.M. Robertson B.J.

Genet. 1995; 21: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and BRI is not processed in these cells unless furin is coexpressed (8Kim S.H. Wang R. Gordon D.J. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Lynn D.G. Thinakaran G. Meredith S.C. Sisodia S.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 984-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Cells were labeled with [35S]cysteine for 2 h, and intracellular and secreted BRI-derivatives were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with the αBRI-NT, an antibody raised against the N-terminal 52 amino acids of BRI, and CT11 antibodies, respectively. As we previously reported, BRI and BRI-L are not proteolytically cleaved by furin in RPE.40 cells (Fig. 2,A and B, lanes 1 and 1′) but proteolysis is completely restored by coexpression of furin (Fig.2, A and B, lanes 2 and2′). Notably, the N-terminal fragment of BRI was present, albeit at lower levels, when PC6A or LPC was coexpressed (Fig.2A, lanes 4 and 6). Similarly, the level of the secreted C-terminal peptide was most abundant in medium of cells expressing furin, but lower levels of the peptide were apparent in medium of cells that coexpressed PC6A or LPC (Fig. 2A,lanes 4′ and 6′). Phosphorimaging quantification revealed that PC6A and LPC process BRI at ∼20% of the efficiency of furin (Fig. 2C). PACE4 and PC6B failed to show proteolytic activity against BRI (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and3′). Thus, relative to furin, other PCs appear to have a considerably reduced activity in BRI processing. Similar results were obtained for BRI-L; furin was the most efficient protease for processing BRI-L (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, LPC, like furin, also exhibits higher activity against BRI-L compared with wild type BRI (Fig. 2, A and B, compare lanes 6′; quantified in D). However, and for reasons not presently clear, PC6A appears to cleave wild type and mutant molecules with similar efficiency (Fig. 2, A and B, comparelanes 4′; quantified in D). These data further support our earlier suggestion that the 11-amino acid extension in BRI-L induces local structural alterations that differentially affect proteolytic processing by the PCs. In any event, we demonstrate that the differences in processing efficiency by PCs are not due to failure to express the proteases, as expression of each PC was confirmed by immunoprecipitation analyses using respective antibodies (Fig.2E). Although it is difficult to quantify the activities of each protease in the transfected cells, we would expect that the expression level of all the PCs in these transient transfections should be enough to reach a saturation level to proteolyze the cotransfected substrate. We then examined the proteolytic processing of a recently identified Danish variant of BRI (BRI-D) (7Vidal R. Revesz T. Rostagno A. Kim E. Holton J.L. Bek T. Bojsen-Moller M. Braendgaard H. Plant G. Ghiso J. Frangione B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4920-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We generated cDNA encoding an APLP1-tagged BRI-D and transiently transfected the construct into CHO-K1 or RPE.40 cells. Detergent cell lysates and conditioned medium were prepared and analyzed by Western blot with αBRI-NT and CT11 antibodies respectively. αBRI-NT antibody detected a ∼42-kDa full-length BRI-D protein in lysates of both cell lines and an ∼37 kDa BRI-D “NTF” in CHO-K1 cells (Fig.3A, lanes 1 and2). However, the BRI-D NTF was not observed in RPE.40 cells (Fig. 3A, lane 3). Parallel analysis of the conditioned medium of transfected CHO-K1 cells revealed the presence of a ∼4-kDa ADan peptide (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and2). In contrast, we failed to detect any secreted peptides in the medium of RPE.40 cells expressing BRI-D (Fig. 3B,lane 3). However, coexpression of BRI-D with furin in RPE.40 cells led to the production and secretion of the ∼4-kDa ADan peptide (Fig. 3B, lane 4), in parallel with the production of a BRI-D NTF in cell lysates (Fig. 3A,lane 4). These results indicated that furin mediates endoproteolytic processing of BRI and its pathogenic variants (BRI-L and BRI-D), resulting in the secretion of respective C-terminal peptides. We then asked whether BRI-D was also subject to enhanced proteolytic processing by furin, as we had shown earlier for BRI-L (8Kim S.H. Wang R. Gordon D.J. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Lynn D.G. Thinakaran G. Meredith S.C. Sisodia S.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 984-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). N2a cells transiently expressing epitope-tagged BRI, BRI-L, or BRI-D, were labeled with [35S]cysteine for 2 h, and cellular or secreted BRI derivatives were immunoprecipitated with αBRI-NT or CT11 antibodies. The synthetic rate of full-length BRI molecule after 10 min of pulse-labeling is comparable for each BRI variant (Fig.4A). Surprisingly, and in contrast to cells expressing BRI-L, that secrete significantly higher levels of ABri peptide compared with cells expressing wild type BRI (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 1 and 2; quantified in D), the level of secreted ADan peptides in the conditioned medium of cells expressing BRI-D was considerably reduced (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 1 and 3; quantified in D). To explore this apparent discrepancy in levels of secreted ABri and ADan peptides, we examined the levels of peptides in cell lysates; our earlier studies had shown that BRI-and BRI-L-derived C-terminal peptides can be detected in cell lysates, consistent with furin-mediated processing in intracellular compartments (8Kim S.H. Wang R. Gordon D.J. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Lynn D.G. Thinakaran G. Meredith S.C. Sisodia S.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 984-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We now show that much higher levels of ADan peptide are present in lysates of cells expressing BRI-D compared with the levels of wild type peptides in cells expressing BRI (Fig. 4C, comparelanes 1 and 3). Interestingly, phosphorimaging analysis revealed that intracellular levels of both ABri and ADan peptides were elevated by ∼4 fold compared with wild type peptides (Fig. 4, C and E). To determine whether the intracellular accumulation of ADan peptides is the result of slower transport of the peptide from intracellular stores, we performed pulse-chase analysis. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs encoding BRI, BRI-L, or BRI-D. Parallel dishes of transfected cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine for 2 h, then chased for 2, 4, 6, or 8 h at 37 °C (Fig. 5). The cell lysates and conditioned medium were prepared at each time point and analyzed by immunoprecipitation with CT11 antibody. In the cell lysates, variable levels of radiolabeled ∼40-kDa full-length proteins were detected and these species diminished in levels over the chase period. (Fig. 5A, upper panel). Consistent with the results in Fig. 4, we observed elevated levels of ABri and ADan peptides in the cell lysates after a 2-h pulse compared with the levels of the wild type C-terminal peptide (Fig.5A, lower panel, compare lanes 1′,6′, and 11′; quantified in C). Moreover, the levels of secreted ADan peptide in the medium was considerably reduced, while cells expressing BRI-L secrete significantly higher levels of ABri peptide compared with cells expressing wild type BRI (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 1, 6, and 11; quantified in D). Even after 8 h into the chase period, the amount of ADan peptide in the conditioned medium was not increased; most of the ADan peptide remained within intracellular compartments (Fig. 5A,lower panels, lanes 11′-15′). Collectively, these results support the notion that BRI-D is subject to enhanced processing by furin, but that the bulk of the resultant ADan peptides are retained in intracellular compartments. Recent studies revealed that a mutation at the termination codon of the BRI2 gene encoding a type II membrane protein, BRI, is the underlying genetic defect of FBD, an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder (2Vidal R. Frangione B. Rostagno A. Mead S. Revesz T. Plant G. Ghiso J. Nature. 1999; 399: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The mutantBRI2 gene encodes BRI-L, the precursor of the ∼4-kDa ABri peptide that accumulates in amyloid deposits of brains of FBD patients (2Vidal R. Frangione B. Rostagno A. Mead S. Revesz T. Plant G. Ghiso J. Nature. 1999; 399: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that furin mediates endoproteolysis of both BRI and BRI-L between arginine 243 and glutamic acid 244, resulting in the secretion of ∼3 kDa and ∼4 kDa C-terminal peptides, respectively (8Kim S.H. Wang R. Gordon D.J. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Lynn D.G. Thinakaran G. Meredith S.C. Sisodia S.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 984-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The results in the present study provide strong evidence that furin is the major protease responsible for the cleavage of BRI variants. First, proteolytic cleavages of BRI and BRI-L are inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by inducible expression of the furin inhibitor, α1-PDX. α1-PDX is relatively specific furin inhibitor and its IC50 for furin is much lower than for other members of the PC family (17Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A.J. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Both ∼37-kDa N terminal fragments and secreted ∼3–4-kDa C-terminal fragments are decreased with increased expression of α1-PDX. Moreover, following coexpression of several PCs and BRI or BRI-L in a furin-defective cell line RPE.40, in which BRI and BRI-L fail to be cleaved, furin is most efficient in restoring endoproteolysis of BRI and BRI-L. Other PCs show much lower activities; PC6A and LPC are ∼20% as active as furin, while PACE4 and PC6B fail to proteolyse BRI and BRI-L. It is noteworthy that LPC, like furin, also exhibits enhanced cleavage of BRI-L while PC6A cleaves wild type and mutant molecules with similar efficiency. These results suggest that the C-terminal extension present in the BRI-L alters the local conformation of the precursor in a manner that leads to enhanced proteolysis by furin and other PCs. Very recently, Vidal et al. (7Vidal R. Revesz T. Rostagno A. Kim E. Holton J.L. Bek T. Bojsen-Moller M. Braendgaard H. Plant G. Ghiso J. Frangione B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4920-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) described a different genetic defect, a decamer duplication just before the stop codon of theBRI2 gene in neurodegenerative condition, termed FDD (7Vidal R. Revesz T. Rostagno A. Kim E. Holton J.L. Bek T. Bojsen-Moller M. Braendgaard H. Plant G. Ghiso J. Frangione B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4920-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). We now report that like wild type BRI and FBD-associated variant BRI-L, the FDD-associated Danish variant (BRI-D) is processed by furin. Interestingly, the BRI-D precursor is also subject to enhanced furin-mediated cleavage. However, and in striking contrast to BRI-L, the ADan peptide largely accumulates in intracellular compartments; the level of secreted ADan peptide in the conditioned medium is much lower compared with those of wild type and ABri peptides indicating that this peptide is poorly secreted. At present, it is unclear why the ABri and ADan peptides behave so differently with regard to secretion. However, it is very possible that the ADan peptide has a higher propensity to aggregate intracellularly, thus precluding its secretion, while the ABri peptide is relatively more soluble following its production, leading to its secretion into the medium. This hypothesis can now be tested by structural and biophysical analyses of synthetic ADan and ABri peptides. The mechanisms by which ABri or ADan peptides initiate the clinical syndromes and pathophysiological cascades in patients have not been defined. However, it is tempting to suggest that different biochemical properties of two peptides originated from the same precursor molecule, but with different types of mutations, are responsible for similar, but distinct clinical and pathological phenotypes. Abundant evidence has accrued to suggest that intracellular accumulation of protein aggregates triggers a cascade of events causing neuronal damage in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Creutzfeld-Jakob's disease, and Huntington's disease and related polyglutamine repeat expansion disorders (25Hartmann T. Eur. Arch. Psychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 1999; 249: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26Spillantini M.G. Schmidt M.L. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Jakes R. Goedert M.

Thus, it is not inconceivable that intracellular accumulation of amyloidogenic ADan or ABri peptides results in the neuronal dysfunction and damage leading to the disease. In this regard, Kopito and co-workers (28Bence N.F. Sampat R.M. Kopito R.R. Science. 2001; 292: 1552-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar) have convincingly demonstrated that protein aggregation in intracellular compartments severely impairs the ubiquitin proteosome system, while Glabe and co-workers (29Yang A.J. Chandswangbhuvana D. Margol L. Glabe C.G. J Neurosci. Res. 1998; 52: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) have proposed that the intracellular accumulation of amyloid beta peptides in neurons in Alzheimer's disease leads to lysosomal dysfunction and leakage and subsequent cell death. In this regard, it is noteworthy that synthetic ABri peptide, especially the oligomeric form, induces apoptotic cell death in vitro while the wild type peptide is not toxic to cells (30El-Agnaf O.M.

Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To more fully define the role of these peptides in the neurodegeneration in vivo, it will be critical to generate transgenic mice that overexpress human BRI-L or BRI-D in the nervous system. Patients with FBD have very unusual clinical features, including early motor deficits and cerebellar ataxia followed by cognitive changes. FDD patients first develop cataracts followed by hearing impairments and progressive dementia. The histopathological lesions are quite severe in both diseases. We anticipate that transgenic mice expressing BRI-L or BRI-D will recapitulate the histological lesions and behavioral alterations that typify FBD or FDD, information that will serve to clarify the processes that lead to neuronal dysfunction and death in these disorders.

Little is known about the identity of functionally important interactions between Gβγ and GIRK channels. We tested the effects of all mammalian Gβ subunits on channel activity and showed that whereas Gβ1−4 subunits activate heteromeric GIRK channels independently of receptor activation, Gβ5 does not. Gβ1 and Gβ5 both bind the N and C termini of the GIRK1 and GIRK4 channel subunits. Chimeric analysis between the Gβ1 and Gβ5 proteins revealed a 90-amino acid stretch that spans blades two and three of the seven-propeller structure and is required for channel activation. Within this region, eight non-conserved amino acids were critical for the activity of Gβ1, as mutation of each residue to its counterpart in Gβ5 significantly reduced the ability of Gβ1 to stimulate channel activity. In particular, mutation of residues Ser-67 and Thr-128 to the corresponding Gβ5 residues completely abolished Gβ1 stimulation of GIRK channel activity. Mapping these functionally important residues on the three-dimensional structure of Gβ1 shows that Ser-67, Ser-98, and Thr-128 are the only surface accessible residues. Gαi1 interacts with Ser-98 but not with Ser-67 and Thr-128 in the heterotrimeric Gαβγ structure. Further characterization of the three mutant proteins showed that they fold properly and interact with Gγ2. Of the three identified functionally important residues, the Ser-67 and Thr-128 Gβ mutants significantly inhibited basal currents of a channel point mutant that displays Gβγ-mediated basal but not agonist-induced currents.

Our findings indicate that the presence of Gβ residues that do not interact with Gα are involved in Gβγ interactions in the absence of agonist stimulation. Heterotrimeric GTP-binding (G) proteins are made of α, β, and γ subunits. Ligand activation of G protein-coupled receptors catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP on Gα subunits, leading to their dissociation from Gβγ. Both the Gα-GTP and Gβγ subunits are thus activated and capable of interacting with and stimulating downstream effector proteins. Hydrolysis of GTP yields Gα-GDP that re-associates with Gβγ forming the inactive heterotrimer. The three-dimensional structures of G protein subunits in the active and inactive states or in complex with each other have been determined (1Sprang S.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 639-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Yet, the details of how G protein subunit interactions with effectors lead to signaling are poorly understood. Acetylcholine-activated K+ channels were the first effectors identified for the Gβγ subunits (2Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1987; 325: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar), providing a highly sensitive assay for Gβγ signaling. Despite intensive study, little is known about the nature of the interactions between these two proteins.

Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). Coexpression of GIRK heterotetramers reveals agonist-independent (basal) currents that can be stimulated further in the presence of agonist. Both basal and agonist-induced currents depend on Gβγ subunits, as proteins that bind Gβγ abolish all K+ currents (8He C. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol.

Interestingly, mutation of a Leu residue (GIRK4-L339, GIRK1-L333) abolished agonist-induced currents while leaving basal activity intact (8He C. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol.

Interestingly, it has been shown that the N terminus of the channel can bind the trimeric GDP-bound Gαβγ complex as well (9Huang C.L. Slesinger P.A. Casey P.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

In atrial and neuronal cells, GIRK channels are activated specifically by Gβγ subunits complexed to pertussis toxin-sensitive Gα subunits. However, their activation by receptors coupled to Gαs has been reported in some heterologous expression systems (16Fidler-Lim N. Dascal N. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 105: 421-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 17Robillard L. Ethier N. Lachance M. Hébert T.E. Cell. Signal. 2000; 9: 673-682Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but not in others (18Leaney J.L. Milligan G. Tinker A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that Gβγ activation of GIRK channels can be mediated by several different Gβγ subunit combinations suggesting a promiscuous interaction between Gβ and GIRK channels (19Wickman K.D. Iniguez-Lluhl J.A. Davenport P.A. Taussig R. Krapivinsky G.B. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1994; 368: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). This assertion was based on the activity of two Gβ (Gβ1 and Gβ2) subunits in combination with four different Gγ subunits (Gγ1, Gγ2, Gγ5, and Gγ7). Complete promiscuity of Gβγ subunits leading to activation of GIRK channels would exclude the large number of distinct Gβγ complexes as possible contributors to Gβγ-specific signaling. Lei and colleagues (20Lei Q. Jones M.B. Talley E.M. Schrier A.D. McIntire W.E. Garrison J.C. Bayliss D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9771-9776Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) have recently reported that although Gβ5 subunits bound GIRK channels, as other mammalian Gβ subunits did, they failed to stimulate channel activity. Possible differences between Gβ1 and Gβ5 accounting for their distinct effects remain to be elucidated. Since Gα subunits compete with effectors for interactions with Gβγ subunits, Ford et al. (21Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S. Iyengar R. Miller R.J. Jan L.Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Hamm H.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) identified specific Gα contact points on Gβ critical for activation of different effectors, including GIRK channels. Furthermore, Albsoul-Younes and colleagues (22Albsoul-Younes A.M. Sternweis P.M. Zhao P. Nakata H. Nakajima S. Nakajima Y. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12712-12717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) showed that Gβ chimeras that incorporated some residues fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae Gβ displayed reduced activity in stimulating GIRK channels. Some of these regions were Gα-independent suggesting a role for multiple regions of Gβγ for channel activation. However, the significance of Gα-independent interactions with the channel was not further explored. In the present study, we have tested the interaction of all mammalian Gβ subunits with GIRK channels. These channels provide an excellent model for effector-Gβγ interactions and specificity of Gβγ signaling. By comparing Gβ1 and Gβ5 subunits that exhibit differences in their abilities to regulate GIRK currents, we have identified several Gβ residues important for activation of GIRK channels. These amino acid residues map onto different surfaces of the Gβ three-dimensional structure, suggesting multiple interactions between the channel and Gβ. Interestingly, these residues include not only Gα contact points, but in addition, amino acids that do not interact with Gα subunits. Residues that do not interact with Gα subunits were found to be important for the agonist-independent or basal activity of these channels. These results identify for the first time functionally significant Gβ residues that are independent of interactions with Gα. All the cDNAs used were subcloned into pGEMHE (23Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) to accommodate sufficient expression in oocytes. Chimeric constructs were made by the method of Splice by Overlap Extension as described previously (8He C. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12517-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The PCR reactions were performed using Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for only 12 cycles to reduce undesirable mutations. All the chimeric constructs were confirmed by sequencing. The mutants were made using the QuikChange method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using high fidelity Pfu polymerase for 12–16 cycles only. All the mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. cDNA constructs were linearized and subjected to in vitro transcription using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The resulting cRNAs were quantified by comparison of two dilutions to a standard on a formaldehyde gel. Oocytes were isolated from Xenopus laevis frogs, enzymatically digested with collagenase and incubated in ND-96 solution containing calcium and nutrients (6Chan K.W. Langan M.N. Sui J.L. Kozak J.A. Pabon A. Ladias J.A. Logothetis D.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 381-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with cRNAs, 2 ng each of GIRK1/GIRK4, 1 ng of hM2 and 2 ng of each G protein subunit or chimera. Following injection, oocytes were kept for 48–96 h in an 18 °C incubator before recordings. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were carried out as previously described (8He C. Zhang H. Mirshahi T. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12517-12524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, the oocytes were placed in a chamber and perfused with a solution containing high potassium (96 mm). Currents were recorded using a voltage step protocol from −100 to +50 mV (control current). Barium (3 mm) was used to measure the left over current that was not inwardly rectifying (barium-insensitive current). We determined the basal current by subtracting barium-insensitive current from the control current. Oocytes were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer in lysis buffer with protease inhibitors on ice and centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 × g. The supernatant was centrifuged using a Beckman-ultracentrifuge at 100,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer. Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto the gels based on estimations from Coomassie Blue staining for each sample. For immunoblotting, samples were boiled in equal volume of loading buffer and run on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose paper using a semi-dry transfer apparatus from Bio-Rad. Nonspecific sites were blocked overnight using a blocking buffer containing 5% non-fat dry milk. The N terminus of Gβ5 was tagged with a FLAG epitope and a mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was used for detection in the immunoblot. For the mutants, a polyclonal antibody to the common region of Gβ was used (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with the proper antibody in the blocking solution for 1 h. The filters were washed and incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary in the blocking buffer for 1 h. The blots were washed extensively and then subjected to detection using the enhanced chemiluminescence method. Mutants from three different batches of oocytes were tested for expression level. The G proteins used for trypsin digestion experiments were generated using the BaculoGold Expression System (PharMingen) and were purified by coexpression of a hexahistidine-tagged γ2 according to Kozasa and Gilman (24Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) except that Lubrol was replaced with CHAPS in the final washes. Final protein concentrations were estimated against known amount of bovine serum albumin standard on SDS-PAGE following Coomassie staining. GST-GIRK1 C-terminal domain (GIRK1, amino acids 182–501), GST-GIRK1 N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–86), GST-GIRK4 C-terminal domain (GIRK4, amino acids 186–419), or GST-GIRK4 N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–91) fusion proteins were used in an in vitro protein interaction assay as described previously (17Robillard L. Ethier N. Lachance M. Hébert T.E. Cell. Signal. 2000; 9: 673-682Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Interaction assays were performed using solubilized membranes from Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses. Confluent cells were infected for 48 h with viruses encoding either Gβ1γ2 or Gβ5γ2. Membranes were prepared and solubilized with 0.3% β-dodecyl maltoside (25Lachance M. Ethier N. Wolbring G. Schnetkamp P.P.M. Hebert T.E. Cell. Signal. 1999; 11: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For the interaction assay, solubilized membranes were brought up to 0.01% Lubrol-PX, and the assays were performed in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.01% Lubrol-PX. Purified Gβ1γ2 was used at different concentrations as a standard to determine the approximate concentration of Gβγ in Sf9 membrane preparations and as a positive control in the GST pulldown assay. GST fusion proteins (200 nm) were incubated with solubilized Sf9 membranes at an estimated Gβγ concentration of 30 nm for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle agitation. Glutathione-4B-Sepharose beads (40 μl) were subsequently added to the reaction and incubated for an additional 1–2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with three volumes of phosphate-buffered saline with 0.06% Lubrol-PX and eluted with SDS loading buffer. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described (17Robillard L. Ethier N. Lachance M. Hébert T.E. Cell. Signal. 2000; 9: 673-682Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Lachance M. Ethier N.

Signal. 1999; 11: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) using the common anti-Gβ (T-20 antibody raised against the C terminus, Santa-Cruz Biotech) and anti-GST antibodies (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and developed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). We used the oocyte expression system to test the ability of different Gβ subunits to activate GIRK channels. The GIRK1/GIRK4 heteromeric channel was expressed in oocytes. Fig. 1 Ashows representative recordings using two-electrode voltage clamp in oocytes expressing GIRK1/GIRK4 channels. Oocytes were held at 0 mV, and currents were recorded in response to voltage steps from −100 mV to +50 mV in bathing solutions containing potassium concentrations similar to those found intracellularly. Similar experiments in oocytes from the same frog that expressed Gβ1γ2 or Gβ5γ2 subunits in addition to GIRK1/GIRK4 are shown in the middle and lower traces of Fig. 1 A, respectively. Expression of Gβ1γ2 subunits significantly enhanced GIRK1/GIRK4 channel activity (middle trace), whereas Gβ5γ2 did not (lower trace). Fig. 1 B summarizes these results in current-voltage plots from the same batch of oocytes expressing GIRK1/GIRK4 alone, with Gβ1γ2, or with Gβ5γ2. Fig.1 C shows the effectiveness of different Gβ subunits co-expressed with Gγ2 to enhance GIRK1/GIRK4 currents in oocytes. For comparison, currents at −80 mV were normalized to the levels of GIRK1/GIRK4 expressed alone. In the presence of Gγ2, Gβ1−4 enhanced GIRK1/GIRK4 basal currents significantly. Gβ5γ2, on the other hand, showed a reduction of the basal currents when co-expressed with GIRK1/GIRK4. To confirm that Gβ5 was expressed in oocytes, we tagged the Gβ5 subunits with the FLAG-epitope. The FLAG-tagged Gβ5 reduced basal currents similarly to the non-tagged Gβ5 (data not shown). Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 D) showed that the Gβ5 subunit is expressed in oocytes, and therefore lack of expression cannot explain its inability to activate GIRK1/GIRK4 channels. To address the question of whether the Gβ5 effect on GIRK channel activity could be the result of direct interactions of this Gβ subunit with the channel, we used a biochemical-binding assay. GST fusion proteins of the N- and C-terminal domains of GIRK1 or GIRK4 were purified and pulldown assays were performed with solubilized membranes from Sf9 cells expressing Gβ1γ2 or Gβ5γ2 combinations. Fig. 1 E shows that 30 nm Gβ1γ2 or Gβ5γ2 both bound the N- and C-terminal domains of the GIRK subunits. These results are in close agreement with those obtained recently by Leiet al. (20Lei Q. Jones M.B. Talley E.M. Schrier A.D. McIntire W.E. Garrison J.C. Bayliss D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9771-9776Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), showing that purified Gβ5γ2 interacted directly with the GIRK heteromer. It is likely that the effect of Gβ5γ2 on basal currents is the result of direct binding and competition with endogenous Gβ for binding sites on the channel. We next proceeded to identify critical functional regions in Gβ1 that are important for activation of GIRK channels. Chimeric constructs between Gβ1 and Gβ5 were designed to identify a minimal region of Gβ1 that when grafted into the background of Gβ5 would activate the channel (Fig.2 A). These Gβ chimeras were designed using an alignment based on the known structural motifs of Gβ (26Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

Wild-type Gβ1γ2 and Gβ5γ2 were tested each time on the same batch of oocytes. Fig. 2 B shows basal oocyte currents expressed as a percentage of GIRK current achieved by co-expression of wild-type Gβ1γ2. Results from oocytes injected with channel only, wild-type Gβ1γ2, and Gβ5γ2 are shown for comparison. The chimera β1(1–142)β5 (amino acids 1–142 of Gβ1 and 152–353 of Gβ5) activated the channel to a similar extent as the wild-type Gβ1, indicating that the N-terminal 142 amino acids of Gβ1 harbored the critical differences between Gβ1 and Gβ5 in activating GIRK currents. Chimera β5β1(52–340) (amino acids 52–340 of Gβ1 and 1–59 of Gβ5) also activated GIRK1/GIRK4 similarly to the wild-type Gβ1, suggesting that the 51-N-terminal-residue differences were not important for GIRK activation. The chimera β5β1(52–142)β5 (amino acids 1–59 of Gβ5, 52–142 of Gβ1, and 152–353 of Gβ5) activated GIRK1/GIRK4 channels when expressed in oocytes. This chimera contained a minimal region of Gβ1 that when inserted into Gβ5 caused GIRK channel activation. Fig. 2 C shows the position of this region on the crystal structure of Gβ1γ2 as adapted from Wall et al. (26Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). The white colored areas identify the region of Gβ1 between residues 52–142 that includes predominantly blades two and three in the seven-propeller structure. Fig. 2 D shows an alignment of this region between Gβ1 and Gβ5. Of the 90 amino acids contained within this region, 51% are identical between the two proteins. These data suggest that specific residues of Gβ1 within this region are critical for the ability to activate GIRK channels. Recently, Ford et al. (21Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S. Iyengar R. Miller R.J. Jan L.Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Hamm H.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) identified which Gα contact points on Gβ were important in activating distinct effectors. Each of the Gα contact points on Gβ1 (as identified from the crystal structure) was mutated to an alanine, and the mutant tested for its ability to activate several effectors, including GIRK channels. In these studies GIRK1/GIRK4 were co-expressed in oocytes with Gγ2 and wild-type or mutant Gβ1 subunits and were tested for effects on basal current levels. Substitution by alanine of any of six Gβ1 residues contacting Gα reduced the ability of Gβ1 to activate the channel. Five of the six amino acids are contained within the Gβ1(52–142) region. We compared the ability to activate GIRK1/GIRK4 of each mutant versus that of wild-type Gβ1γ2 in the same batch of oocytes. The Gβ1 mutants K78A, I80A, K89A, and W99A, all of which are conserved in Gβ5, failed to activate the channel in agreement with the reported results by Ford et al. (21Ford C.E. Skiba N.P. Bae H. Daaka Y. Reuveny E. Shekter L.R. Rosal R. Weng G. Yang C.S. Iyengar R. Miller R.J. Jan L.Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Hamm H.E. Science. 1998; 280: 1271-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) (37 ± 7%, 40% ± 5%, 42% ± 5%, and 41 ± 2% of wild-type Gβ1γ2). However, in our hands, L55A, the only one of the six Gα-contacting residues identified by Ford et al. that was not conserved between Gβ1 and Gβ5, showed enhancement of GIRK channel activity that was not significantly different from that with wild-type Gβ1γ2 (76 ± 16% of wild-type Gβ1γ2,p > 0.2, n = 10). Therefore, the residues involved in Gα interactions cannot account for the difference between Gβ1 and Gβ5 in their ability to stimulate channel activity. Thus, we proceeded to identify specific residues in Gβ1 that are important for channel activation based on the differences between Gβ1 and Gβ5. To identify specific residues within the Gβ1 (52–142) region, which are responsible for the difference in stimulation of GIRK currents by Gβ1 and Gβ5, we mutated each Gβ1 residue to its corresponding Gβ5 counterpart and tested its ability to stimulate GIRK currents in oocytes. Each mutant was co-expressed with GIRK1/GIRK4 and Gγ2. The ability of each mutant to stimulate channel activity was expressed as a percentage of that achieved by the wild-type Gβ1γ2 that was tested in parallel. We screened for mutations that significantly (p < 0.01) impaired the ability of Gβ1 to stimulate GIRK activity. Fig.3 A shows the results from 34 of the 44 mutants tested. These mutants enhanced GIRK1/GIRK4 currents to levels that were not significantly different from the wild-type Gβ1γ2 (p > 0.01 unpaired t test,n = 6–14). Fig. 3 B shows a different set of mutants that showed significant reduction in their ability to enhance GIRK1/GIRK4 currents compared with the wild-type Gβ1γ2 (p < 0.01, unpaired t test, n = 12–24). Thelower panel of Fig. 3 B shows a representative Western blot from oocytes expressing each of these mutants (n = 3). An antibody raised against a common Gβ region (M-14, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for immunoblotting. This antibody recognized the endogenous oocyte Gβ subunits (two left lanes) in oocytes that were either non-injected or were injected with channel subunits alone. A larger band corresponding to the exogenous Gβ can only be seen in oocytes that were injected with either the wild-type or the mutant Gβ1 subunit. Thus, expression levels of the mutant Gβ1 subunits with significantly impaired ability to stimulate GIRK1/GIRK4 currents were similar to the wild-type Gβ1. Fig. 3 C shows results from two additional mutants that failed to activate GIRK channels. S67K and T128F showed no enhancement of the channel activity as compared with the wild-type Gβ1γ2 (p < 0.01 unpaired t test,n = 12). Furthermore, oocytes expressing the S67K mutant showed significantly reduced currents compared with oocytes that only expressed the channel subunits (p < 0.01, unpaired t test). Again, Western blot analysis indicated expression levels for these two mutants comparable with the wild-type Gβ1 (n = 3). Two additional mutants, L139V and G141M, also did not enhance channel activity. However, we could not detect expression of these mutants in oocytes using Western blot analysis. Therefore, these two mutants may result in conformational changes in the Gβ1 structure that lead to degradation or misfolding preventing antibody detection. Overall, these data identify several residues in blades two and three of Gβ1 that are involved in mediating activation of GIRK channels. These residues differ between Gβ1 and Gβ5 and appear responsible for the failure of Gβ5 to stimulate GIRK currents. However, mutation of these residues in Gβ5 to the corresponding Gβ1 residues did not affect the functional effects of Gβ5 on the channel (data not shown). This suggests that these individual residues are necessary in Gβ1 for functional interactions but they are not sufficient in mediating channel activation by Gβ5. Since our chimeric design focused on important functional differences between Gβ1 and Gβ5, conserved residues involved in interactions with the channel were not probed. To gain a better un"

Higashi T. Sasagawa M. Kusai M. Nakai M. Okunuki K. Biochem. J. 1960; 77: 194-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It was established quickly that this class of enzyme can also catalyze the one-electron reduction of nitrite (NO 2−) to nitric oxide (2Yamanaka T. Ota A. Okunuki K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1961; 53: 294-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Later, Singh (3Singh J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 333: 28-36Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) demonstrated a third reaction, the two-electron reduction of hydroxylamine (NH2OH) to ammonia. The principal physiological role of cytochromes cd1 is now believed to be the reduction of nitrite. The enzyme is produced by bacteria that catalyze the respiratory process of denitrification, the sequential reduction of nitrate via nitrite, nitric oxide, and nitrous oxide to dinitrogen gas, an essential component of the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle (4Berks B.C. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W.B. Richardson D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1232: 97-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). However, there continue to be suggestions that the oxidase activity may have some physiological importance, for instance in the transition between anaerobiosis and aerobiosis (e.g. Ref. 5Sjogren T. Hajdu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13072-13076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The cytochromes cd1 from P. aeruginosa and Paracoccus pantotrophus (former species Paracoccus denitrificans GB17 and Thiosphaera pantotropha (6Rainey F.A. Kelly D.P. Stackebrandt E. Burghardt J. Hiraishi A. Katayama Y. Wood A.P. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1999; 49: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar)) have now been characterized extensively. The enzymes are dimeric; each monomer contains one c-type cytochrome center, which accepts electrons from donor proteins, and one specialized d1 heme that provides the catalytic site. P. pantotrophus cd11 has recently been the subject of rapid reaction kinetic studies using each known substrate (7Koppenhöfer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8George S.J. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 10: 885-888Google Scholar) and crystallographic studies on the reactions with nitrite and oxygen (5Sjogren T. Hajdu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13072-13076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, this array of data is not underpinned by extensive and reliable information on the steady state kinetic properties of the enzyme. The descriptions of specific activity and analyses of steady state kinetics for cytochromes cd1 are far from complete. Moreover, it is difficult to make comparisons between different publications because it is rare to find two studies that employed the same pH, temperature, and other conditions. Assays can be established using either proteins (e.g. azurin, cytochromec) or small redox active molecules (e.g. ascorbate, tetramethylphenylenediamine, viologens, quinols) as an electron donor. Comparison of nitrite with the alternative substrates, oxygen or hydroxylamine, also requires that the same electron donor be used in each case. Finally, the vast majority of the available data has been recorded for P. aeruginosa cytochromecd1 (see Ref. 11Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Fülöp V. Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Poulos T. Wiehardt K. Handbook of Metalloproteins. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK2001: 424-439Google Scholar for discussion), which may not help in the analysis of the considerable body of pre-steady state data now available for the P. pantotrophus enzyme, because the enzymes from the two sources show considerable structural differences (12Fülöp V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 13Nurizzo D. Silvestrini M.C. Mathieu M. Cutruzzolà F. Bourgeois D. Fülöp V. Hajdu J. Brunori M. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1157-1171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Recently, the physiological electron donor proteins to P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1, pseudoazurin and cytochrome c550, have, uniquely for acd1, been unambiguously identified (14Pearson I.V. Ph.D. thesis. University of Oxford, Oxford2000Google Scholar). The concept of pseudospecificity has been invoked to explain how two such proteins with very different structures can transfer electrons to the same enzyme (15Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Leung Y.C. Chan C. Moir J.W.B. Howlett G. Ferguson S.J. Radford S.E. Hajdu J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This idea is based on the finding that both the donor proteins have a surface patch consisting of hydrophobic and positively charged residues, whereas the electron accepting cytochromec domain of cd1 has a complementary patch containing hydrophobic and negatively charged residues. It has been suggested (15Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Leung Y.C. Chan C. Moir J.W.B. Howlett G. Ferguson S.J. Radford S.E. Hajdu J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 975-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) that only a transient and promiscuous interaction between the surface patches of cd1 and the donor protein is required for electron transfer to occur. However, the relative quantitative properties of cytochromec550 and pseudoazurin in their steady state turnover interactions with P. pantotrophus cytochromecd1 have not yet been systematically investigated. The non-physiological, but readily available, horse heart cytochrome c can also serve as an electron donor in vitro. Based on work with Pseudomonas stutzericytochrome cd1, use of this cytochrome has been advocated as a general assay method in steady state kinetic studies (16Hulse C.L. Tiedje J.M. Averill B.A. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is clear that, given three potential protein electron donors to P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 and three different electron acceptors, many kinetic constants can, in principle, be acquired. There is no reason to expect that, for example, a KM value determined using nitrite as substrate will be independent of the electron donor used. A further complication arises from a highly unusual property ofP. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1. In the oxidized, “as isolated,” form of the enzyme, the cheme iron has bis-histidinyl coordination, whereas thed1 heme has histidine and tyrosine as axial ligands (12Fülöp V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 17Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W.B. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Upon reduction, the coordination changes at both hemes, to His/Met at the c-type center and His/vacant (penta-coordinate) at the d1 heme (10Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The function of this ligand switching is unclear, but if the reduced protein is reoxidized using hydroxylamine or oxygen, reversion to the oxidized “as isolated” conformation occurs on a time scale of minutes (5Sjogren T. Hajdu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13072-13076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Allen J.W.A. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 885-888Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the enzyme can exist in an oxidized c-heme His/Met coordinated form and that it is this conformer that accepts electrons from one physiological electron donor, pseudoazurin (9Allen J.W.A. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 885-888Google Scholar, 18Allen J.W.A. Cheesman M.R. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 674-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of the steady state kinetic parameters of P. pantotrophus cytochromecd1 using both its physiological electron donors and horse heart cytochrome c, in combination with three alternate electron acceptors. In each case, catalysis is studied commencing with cytochrome cd1 both in its oxidized “as isolated” conformation (c heme His/His) and with the enzyme chemically reduced (i.e. initially c heme His/Met). P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1was purified according to the method of Moir et al. (19Moir J.W.B. Baratta D. Richardson D.J. Ferguson S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) from the periplasms of cells grown anaerobically with nitrate as terminal electron acceptor. Semi-apocytochromecd1 (which contains the c heme but nod1 heme) was prepared from holoprotein according to the method described by Kobayashi et al. (20Kobayashi K. Koppenhöfer A. Ferguson S.J. Tagawa S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13611-13616Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). P. pantotrophus pseudoazurin was purified as described (19Moir J.W.B. Baratta D. Richardson D.J. Ferguson S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) from the total soluble extract of Escherichia coli XL1-Blue transformed with the plasmid pJR2 (21Leung Y.C. Chan C. Reader J.S. Willis A.C. van Spanning R.J.M. Ferguson S.J. Radford S.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cells were grown aerobically on 2× TY medium supplemented with 2 mm CuSO4 and 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin, at 37 °C. Horse heart cytochrome c was purchased from Sigma and used as supplied.P. denitrificans cytochrome c550 was overproduced in E. coli strain 7123 using a similar method to that described by Gordon et al. (22Gordon E.H.J. Steensma E. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 788-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transformed with plasmids pKPD1 containing the gene for cytochromec550 (23Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 340: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and pEC86 containing the genes for the cytochrome c maturation system (24Arslan E. Schulz H. Zuffery P. Künzler L. Thöny-Meyer L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown aerobically on LB medium, supplemented with 100 μg ml−1ampicillin and 35 μg ml−1 chloramphenicol, for at least 24 h. Cytochrome c550 was purified using fast protein liquid chromatography equipment (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. Initially, the cells were resuspended in isotonic buffer, 100 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0; they were disrupted by the addition of 1 mg ml−1 polymyxin B sulfate (Melford) and incubation for 20 min at 37 °C. A periplasmic fraction was recovered by centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 30 min. The soluble material so obtained was diluted 3-fold, applied to a fast-flow DEAE-Sepharose anion exchange column pre-equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and eluted using a 0–300 mm NaCl gradient in the same buffer. Red fractions were recovered, diluted with the same buffer, and applied to a fast-flow Q-Sepharose column; the protein was eluted using a 0–500 mm NaCl gradient, also in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Cytochrome-containing fractions were concentrated to a total volume of 2 ml, applied to a G-50 (Sigma) size exclusion column (2.6 × 90 cm), and eluted at 14 ml h−1. Those fractions judged pure by SDS-PAGE were retained. A yield of ∼4 mg of pure cytochrome c550 per liter of culture was obtained. Note that P. denitrificans cytochromec550 is 85.9% identical to cytochromec550 from P. pantotrophus (25Samyn B. Berks B.C. Page M.D. Ferguson S.J. van Beeumen J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the species from which cytochrome cd1 was isolated for this work; the major differences are at the functionally unimportant C terminus. Activity of cytochrome cd1 was assayed spectrophotometrically by monitoring the change in absorbance of electron donor proteins at wavelengths characteristic of their redox state. Oxidized pseudoazurin absorbs in the visible region with a maximum at 590 nm, whereas reduced pseudoazurin is colorless. The reduced c-type cytochromes both exhibit a sharp absorbance band centered on 550 nm, whereas the oxidized proteins have a broader spectrum with much weaker absorbance at that wavelength. Thus, changes in the intensity of these transitions are a direct probe of the oxidation state of the donor protein and hence the rate of change of that state as electrons are donated to cytochromecd1 during steady state turnover. The concentration of P. pantotrophus pseudoazurin was determined for the oxidized protein using the extinction coefficient 1360m−1 cm−1 at 590 nm (19Moir J.W.B. Baratta D. Richardson D.J. Ferguson S.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar); this value was also taken as the difference extinction coefficient (reducedminus oxidized). The concentrations of P. denitrificans cytochrome c550 and horse heart cytochrome c were determined from the extinction coefficients 30 (26) and 29.5 mm−1cm−1 (16Hulse C.L. Tiedje J.M. Averill B.A. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 172: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) at 550 nm for the reduced proteins, respectively. Difference extinction coefficients (reducedminus oxidized) of 21 (26) and 18.5 mm−1 cm−1 (27Robinson M.K. Martinkus K. Kennelly P.J. Timkovich R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 3921-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) at 550 nm, respectively, were used in activity assays. The concentration ofP. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 was determined from the absorbance of the oxidized protein at 406 nm (ε = 285 mm−1 cm−1 (20Kobayashi K. Koppenhöfer A. Ferguson S.J. Tagawa S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13611-13616Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)) or of the reduced protein at 418 nm (ε = 323 mm−1 cm−1 (7Koppenhöfer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4028-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Koppenhöfer A. Ph.D. thesis. University of Oxford, Oxford1998Google Scholar)). All assays were conducted at 25 °C in gas tight cuvettes with path lengths of 1 or 0.2 cm for pseudoazurin or cytochrome c as electron donor, respectively. Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were conducted in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. In experiments to examine the pH dependence of reactions, a mixed buffer system containing acetate, MOPS, MES, and Tris, each at 12 mm, was used. Reaction was initiated by addition via a Hamilton syringe of cytochrome cd1 to a cuvette containing substrate and electron donor. Potassium nitrite and hydroxylamine hydrochloride solutions were made from the chemicals as supplied by Sigma. Oxygen solutions were prepared by flushing buffer with pure oxygen (British Oxygen Company) for 30 min to produce a saturated solution (1.2 mm (28Kaye G.W.C. Laby T.H. Tables of Physical and Chemical Constants. Longman Group UK Ltd., UK1966: 153Google Scholar)), which was then diluted with argon-sparged buffer to give the desired oxygen concentration. All solutions (except those containing oxygen as assay substrate) were thoroughly deoxygenated by extended sparging with humidified argon. In addition, in assays where oxygen was not substrate, 0.6% (w/v) β-d-glucose, 0.5 units ml−1 glucose oxidase (Sigma) and 200 units ml−1 catalase (Sigma) could be added to the system to scrub any remaining traces of oxygen. Unless stated, pseudoazurin, cytochrome c, and cytochromec550 were used at a concentration 2For the cytochromes c, this concentration represents an upper limit of absorbance at 550 nm, above which we could not be certain of linear absorbance change during reactions.of 200 μm; cytochromecd1 was used at convenient concentrations in the range 15–300 nm. Where oxidized cytochrome cd1 was assayed, it was used as purified. Stock solutions of reducedcd1 were prepared by careful addition of a 1 mm disodium dithionite solution to thoroughly deoxygenated protein solution. 10–70 μl of this reduced enzyme was added to a 0.4–0.8 ml assay solution, such that essentially no excess dithionite would be present; the lack of dithionite was confirmed by the absence of an apparent initial lag phase in the reoxidation of the electron donor and by monitoring the dithionite absorption peak at 315 nm. Throughout the period during which measurements were taken, the stock solution of cd1 was repeatedly examined spectrophotometrically to confirm that it remained fully reduced. Solutions of reduced electron donor proteins were prepared by addition of excess acsorbate. The mixtures were then passed down a PD10 desalting column (Amersham Biosciences), which had been pre-equilibrated with deoxygenated buffer. The first 80% of the protein to be eluted was retained for assays and was stored on ice in a degassed vessel until required. Reduced pseudoazurin was identified by its absorbance at 280 nm. Kinetic data from steady state assays were analyzed using the curve fitting program TableCurve 2D (Jandel Scientific). In all cases, the initial rate of reaction was considered. (When electron donor proteins become reoxidized, the oxidized material may, in principle, be inhibitory of reaction between cytochrome cd1and the remaining reduced electron donor. Following reduction of nitrite in vitro, accumulation of product nitric oxide is inhibitory (29Cutruzzolà F. Brown K. Wilson E.K. Bellelli A. Arese M. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Brunori M. Proc. Natl.

The experimental data recorded during the first 30 s of reaction were fitted to a single exponential function from which the initial rate was calculated. These values were then subjected to Hanes analysis (plots fitted using MS Excel) to produce kinetic constants. Steady state kinetic parameters were determined for each of the electron acceptors, nitrite (the physiological substrate), oxygen, and hydroxylamine, for P. pantotrophus cytochromecd1 using both of its physiological electron donors, pseudoazurin and cytochrome c550, as well as horse heart cytochrome c (TablesI and II). The concentration of electron donor was kept constant, and the electron acceptor concentration was varied in these assays. The numerical values are from Hanes analyses of the experimental data. Reaction rates were monitored by recording the change as a function of time in the intensity of absorbance bands of the electron donor proteins. The data in Table I were obtained when the cytochrome cd1 was introduced to the reaction mixture in its oxidized form as purified (“as isolated”), with bis-histidinyl coordination of the c heme (12Fülöp V.

Our data confirm the need for activation of P. pantotrophuscytochrome cd1 before it can efficiently perform catalysis. The oxidized enzyme (as isolated) has a very low level of catalytic activity (compare Table I with Table II). A similar phenomenon was observed previously with pseudoazurin as electron donor and either nitrite or hydroxylamine as acceptor (9Allen J.W.A. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 885-888Google Scholar). The present data shows the same to be true irrespective of the electron donor used with any of the electron acceptors. Furthermore, when oxidized “as isolated” cytochrome cd1 was mixed with either reduced pseudoazurin (9Allen J.W.A. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 885-888Google Scholar) or cytochrome c550(data not shown) in a stopped-flow apparatus, in the absence of an electron acceptor, no electron transfer reaction was observed. The oxidized His/His coordinated c heme of “as isolated”P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 is thus far from fully competent to accept electrons from its physiological protein electron donors. Its coordination must be switched to His/Met, in which case catalytic competence is established (see also Refs. 9Allen J.W.A. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 885-888Google Scholar and 18Allen J.W.A. Cheesman M.R. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 674-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Given that in vivo experiments show that pseudoazurin and cytochrome c550 are the only electron donors that allow viable cell growth byParacoccus on nitrite (14Pearson I.V. Ph.D. thesis. University of Oxford, Oxford2000Google Scholar), there is now compelling evidence that cytochrome cd1 must either be synthesized in its active conformer in the cell or that there is an as yet unidentified activation factor in the bacterial periplasm. Current electron transfer theories suggest that thermodynamically unfavorable steps in electron transport chains are permissible as long as the overall chain is favorable (32Page C.C. Moser C.C. Chen X. Dutton P.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1531) Google Scholar). Due to the very unusual redox properties of P. pantotrophus cytochromecd1, the reduction potentials of the individual heme centers cannot be determined precisely (33Koppenhöfer A. Turner K.L. Allen J.W.A. Chapman S.K. Ferguson S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4234-4249Google Scholar), but the apparent midpoint potential of the His/His coordinated electron acceptingc heme of cd1 is +60 mV or lower at room temperature. Nevertheless, it might be expected that electron donor proteins such as pseudoazurin (E′0 +230 mV) would transfer electrons to the His/His c heme of cytochrome cd1, even though the reduction potential of the latter is lower than that of the former, because subsequent electron transfer from the c heme to thed1 heme and then to an electron accepting substrate means that the overall electron transfer is thermodynamically favorable (the standard reduction potential for NO 2−/NO is +375 mV). A good example of this type of behavior is the heme chain of Rhodopseudomonas virdis, where the cytochrome c2(Em approximately +280 mV) reduces a heme of theR. virdis reaction center (Emapproximately −50 mV); the potential of the terminal electron-accepting center is approximately +500 mV so the intermediate endergonic step can occur (32Page C.C.

https://openalex.org/W2024817377,"The recurrent t(12;22) (q13;q12) chromosomal translocation associated with soft tissue clear cell sarcoma results in a chimeric protein EWS-ATF-1 that acts as a constitutive transcriptional activator. The CBP/p300 transcriptional coactivator, which links various transcriptional factors to basal transcription apparatus, participates in transcriptional activation, growth and cell cycle control and differentiation. In this study, we show that EWS-ATF-1 associates constitutively with CBP both in vitro and in vivo. Both EWS and ATF-1 fusion domains are needed for this interaction. Here, we demonstrate that EWS-ATF-1 represses p53/CBP-mediated trans-activation function. Overexpression of CBP can counteract this repressive effect of EWS-ATF-1. Taken together, these findings suggest that one of the mechanisms by which EWS-ATF-1 may cause tumors is through targeting CBP/p300 resulting in the loss of function of p53. This novel mechanism may be responsible for the development of these and other related solid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2322090726,"Numerous LOH and mutation analysis studies in different tumor tissues, including prostate, indicate that there are multiple tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) present within the human chromosome 8p21-22 and 10q23-24 regions. Recently, we showed that LZTS1 (or FEZ1), a putative TSG located on 8p22, has the potential to function as a cell growth modulator. We report here the cloning, gene organization, cDNA sequence characterization and expression analysis of LAPSER1, an LZTS1-related gene. This gene maps within a subregion of human chromosome 10q24.3 that has been reported to be deleted in various cancers, including prostate tumors, as frequently as the neighboring PTEN locus. The complete LAPSER1 cDNA sequence encodes a predicted protein containing various domains resembling those typically found in transcription factors (P-Box, Q-rich and multiple leucine zippers). LAPSER1 is expressed at the highest levels in normal prostate and testis, where multiple isoforms are seen, some of which are either undetectable or differentially expressed in some prostate tumor tissues and cell lines. Over-expression of LAPSER1 cDNA strongly inhibited cell growth and colony-forming efficiencies of most cancer cells assessed. Together these data suggest that LAPSER1 is another gene involved in the regulation of cell growth whose loss of function may contribute to the development of cancer."

PPARγ is highly expressed in normal human pancreatic islet α-cells that produce glucagon. This peptide hormone is a functional antagonist of insulin stimulating hepatic glucose output. Therefore, the effect of PPARγ and thiazolidinediones on glucagon gene transcription was investigated. After transient transfection of a glucagon-reporter fusion gene into a glucagon-producing pancreatic islet cell line, thiazolidinediones inhibited glucagon gene transcription when PPARγ was coexpressed. They also reduced glucagon secretion and glucagon tissue levels in primary pancreatic islets. A 5′/3′-deletion and internal mutation analysis indicated that a pancreatic islet cell-specific enhancer sequence (PISCES) motif within the proximal glucagon promoter element G1 was required for PPARγ responsiveness. This sequence motif binds the paired domain transcription factor Pax6. When the PISCES motif within G1 was mutated into a GAL4 binding site, the expression of GAL4-Pax6 restored glucagon promoter activity and PPARγ responsiveness. GAL4-Pax6 transcriptional activity was inhibited by PPARγ in response to thiazolidinedione treatment also at a minimal viral promoter. These results suggest that PPARγ in a ligand-dependent but DNA binding-independent manner inhibits Pax6 transcriptional activity, resulting in inhibition of glucagon gene transcription. These data thereby define Pax6 as a novel functional target of PPARγ and suggest that inhibition of glucagon gene expression may be among the multiple mechanisms through which thiazolidinediones improve glycemic control in diabetic subjects.

Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar). Like other nuclear receptors, PPARγ comprises an amino-terminal ligand-independent transactivation domain (AF-1), a central DNA-binding domain, and a carboxyl-terminal ligand-binding domain that contains a second, ligand-dependent transactivation surface (AF-2) (1Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar). PPARγ binds as a heterodimer with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor, RXR, to response elements in target genes to activate transcription. A typical PPRE consists of a direct repeat of hexamer half-sites, TGACCT, spaced by one nucleotide (DR-1) (1Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar). PPAR and RXR occupy the 5′ and 3′ half-sites, respectively, and thus show a polarity in binding that is the opposite of that observed for other nuclear receptor-RXR heterodimers (1Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar). Like other nuclear receptors, there is evidence that PPARγ-RXR require the ligand-dependent recruitment of coactivator proteins like SRC-1, GRIP-1, pCIP, CBP, p300, DRIP205, and p120 (2Yang W.

These physiologic and pathophysiologic actions suggest that synthetic PPARγ ligands may be of use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Thiazolidinediones like rosiglitazone are PPARγ ligands and a new class of orally active antidiabetic drugs (19Saltiel A.R. Olefsky J.M.

However, the target genes involved are unclear. It has been shown recently that high levels of PPARγ are expressed in glucagon-producing α-cells of the endocrine pancreas (30Dubois M. Pattou F.

The effects of glucagon on blood glucose levels balance those of insulin; glucagon increases hepatic glucose production and opposes hepatic glucose storage, whereas insulin increases peripheral glucose uptake and opposes glucagon-mediated hepatic glucose production. The metabolic consequences of abnormal α-cell function in diabetes are well defined (33Unger R.H. Orci L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 1518-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 34Unger R.H. Orci L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 1575-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 35Lefèbvre P.J. Diabetes Care. 1995; 18: 715-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition to hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and impaired β-cell function, relative hyperglucagonemia is a common feature of patients with type II diabetes (33Unger R.H. Orci L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 1518-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 34Unger R.H. Orci L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 1575-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 35Lefèbvre P.J. Diabetes Care. 1995; 18: 715-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The elevated glucagon levels in diabetes contribute to increased hepatic glucose output and hyperglycemia (33Unger R.H. Orci L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1981; 304: 1518-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 34Unger R.H. Orci L. N. Engl. J.

Consequently, inhibition of glucagon secretion has been shown to reduce fasting hyperglycemia in diabetic animals (36Freyse E.J. Becher T. El-Hag O. Knospe S. Göke B. Fischer U. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 824-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and patients (37Creutzfeldt W.O.C. Kleine N. Willms B. ℘rskov C. Holst J.J.

Effects on the expression of glucagon in pancreatic islets are therefore important aspects in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. Because PPARγ is expressed in glucagon-producing α-cells but its function has been unknown, in the present study the effect of PPARγ and thiazolidinediones on glucagon gene transcription was investigated. PPARγ and thiazolidinediones were found to inhibit glucagon gene transcription in pancreatic islet cells. They also reduced glucagon secretion and tissue levels in pancreatic islets. Mapping studies and the use of GAL4 fusion proteins indicate that PPARγ represses in a ligand-dependent but DNA binding-independent manner transactivation by the paired domain-containing transcription factor Pax6 leading to inhibition of glucagon gene transcription. This novel action of PPARγ assigns a function to PPARγ expressed in pancreatic islet α-cells and suggests that the mechanisms through which thiazolidinediones improve glycemic control in diabetic subjects may include the inhibition of glucagon gene expression.

The plasmid pCMV-GFPtpz was purchased from Canberra-Packard (Dreieich, Germany). Total RNA was extracted from InR1-G9 cells using a commercial kit (RNeasy, Quiagen). For first strand cDNA synthesis, random hexamer primers (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) were used. The RT enzyme was obtained from Invitrogen (Superscript II reverse transcriptase). For PCR amplification, the following primers were used: upstream primer, 5′-AGAGCTGACCCAATGGTTGC-3′; and downstream primer, 5′-ATCTCCGCCAACAGCTTCTC-3′ (EMBL/GenBank™/DDBJ accession no. Z30972) (size of the expected product: 421 bp). PCR without RT step served as control for DNA contamination. After agarose gel electrophoresis, the RT-PCR product was identified by extraction, subcloning (TA-cloning kit, Promega), and cycle sequencing (Thermo Sequenase fluorescent labeled primer cycle sequencing kit, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.; IRD-800 labeled primers, MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). The glucagon-producing pancreatic islet cell line InR1-G9 (46Takaki R. Ono J. Nakamura M. Yokogawa Y. Kumae S. Hiraoka T. Yamaguchi K. Hamaguchi K Uchida S. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1986; 22: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were trypsinized and transfected in suspension by the DEAE-dextran method (40Schwaninger M. Lux G. Blume R. Oetjen E. Hidaka H. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5168-5177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 2 μg of reporter gene plasmids and, when indicated, 1 μg of expression vector per 6-cm dish. Cotransfections were carried out with a constant amount of DNA, which was maintained by adding Bluescript (Stratagene, La Jolla). In all experiments 0.5 μg of cytomegalovirus-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (plasmid pCMV-GFPtpz) per 6-cm dish was cotransfected to check for transfection efficiency (the relative luciferase activities presented in the figures are derived from luciferase/GFP ratios). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and antibiotics as described above. Cell extracts (40Schwaninger M. Lux G. Blume R. Oetjen E. Hidaka H. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5168-5177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared 48 h after transfection. The luciferase assay was performed as described previously (40Schwaninger M. Lux G. Blume R. Oetjen E. Hidaka H. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5168-5177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Green fluorescent protein was measured in the cell extracts using the FluoroCount™ microplate fluorometer (Packard). After the preparation of Langerhans pancreatic islets of NMRI mice (32Zhou Y.T. Shimabukuro M. Wang M.Y. Lee Y. Higa M. Milburn J.L. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

After 48 h, glucagon levels were measured in the supernatants and the islet extracts (40Schwaninger M. Lux G. Blume R. Oetjen E. Hidaka H. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5168-5177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by radioimmunoassay using a commercial kit (IBL, Hamburg, Germany). Rosiglitazone was kindly provided by SmithKline Beecham (Worthing, United Kingdom); darglitazone and englitazone (CP-72,467–02, sodium salt) was provided by Pfizer Inc. (Groton, CT). A stock solution (100 mm) was prepared in Me2SO. Controls received the solvent only. PPARγ was found by RT-PCR to be expressed in the glucagon-producing pancreatic islet cell line InR1-G9 (data not shown). In normal pancreatic islets, the expression of PPARγ is very high, approximately two thirds of the expression level in white adipose tissue (30Dubois M. Pattou F. Kerr-Conte J. Gmyr V. Vandewalle B. Desreumaux P. Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Diabetologia. 2000; 43: 1165-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In contrast, InR1-G9 cells express low levels of PPARγ such that activation of a PPAR-dependent promoter (PPRELuc) required transfection of a PPARγ expression plasmid (Fig.1). This cell line therefore allowed a direct assessment of the role of PPARγ in glucagon gene transcription. Similarly, low level expression of PPARγ in cell lines derived from tissues with high level expression has been reported previously (6Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.J. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3260) Google Scholar, 13Yang X.Y. Wang L.H. Chen T. Hodge D.R. Resau J.H. DaSilva L. Farrar W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4541-4544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To study the effect of PPARγ and thiazolidinediones on glucagon gene transcription, 350 base pairs of the 5′-flanking region of the rat glucagon gene were fused to the luciferase reporter gene (construct −350GluLuc) (40Schwaninger M. Lux G. Blume R. Oetjen E. Hidaka H. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5168-5177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This glucagon promoter fragment is sufficient to confer tissue-specific gene expression (47Philippe J. Drucker D.J. Knepel W. Jepeal L. Misulovin Z. Habener J.F. Mol. Cell.

In the absence of a cotransfected PPARγ expression plasmid, treatment of InR1-G9 cells with the thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone at concentrations up to 100 μm had no effect on glucagon promoter activity (data not shown). Additionally, the cotransfection of an expression plasmid encoding PPARγ alone had no effect on −350GluLuc activity (94 ± 3% of controls, n = 6). However, when a PPARγ expression plasmid was transfected into these cells, rosiglitazone inhibited glucagon gene transcription (Fig.2). Thus rosiglitazone inhibits glucagon gene transcription by a PPARγ-dependent mechanism. Inhibition of glucagon gene transcription by rosiglitazone was concentration-dependent with an IC50 value of ∼300 nm (Fig. 2). Cotransfection of an expression vector encoding RXRα together with PPARγ did not alter the concentration-response curve for inhibition by rosiglitazone of −350GluLuc activity (data not shown). These concentrations of rosiglitazone are similar to those that activated a PPARγ-dependent promoter (Fig. 1). The maximum inhibition of glucagon gene transcription by rosiglitazone was ∼40% (Fig. 2). Like rosiglitazone, two other thiazolidinediones, darglitazone and englitazone, also inhibited glucagon gene transcription (Fig.3). To assess the effect of thiazolidinediones in a natural context, the effect of thiazolidinediones on glucagon secretion and glucagon tissue levels was investigated in primary pancreatic islets. After 48 h of treatment with rosiglitazone, glucagon secretion from isolated pancreatic islets was inhibited by 44% (Fig. 4). Englitazone and darglitazone showed a similar inhibition (Fig. 4). Furthermore, glucagon tissue levels were significantly reduced by treatment with rosiglitazone, englitazone, or darglitazone (Fig. 4). These data indicate that PPARγ inhibits glucagon gene transcription in response to binding of thiazolidinediones. Thiazolidinediones also reduce glucagon tissue levels and secretion in pancreatic islets.Figure 2Inhibition of glucagon gene transcription by rosiglitazone and PPARγ.

A. 2000; 97: 8926-8931Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical evidence suggests that the mammalian resolving enzyme exists in a complex with a junction-specific branch migration apparatus (9Constantinou A. Davies A.A. West S.C. Cell. 2001; 104: 259-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), which is analogous to the interaction of the Escherichia coli resolving enzyme RuvC with the RuvAB complex (10Eggleston A.K. West S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26467-26476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The structures of four junction-resolving enzymes, E. coli RuvC, T4 endonuclease VII, T7 endonuclease I, and archaeal Hjc (reviewed in Ref. 2Lilley D.M.J. White M.F. Nature Reviews Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) have been solved. The structural information, together with detailed sequence comparisons of the known genes, has allowed classification of the resolving enzymes, several of which can be assigned to one of two superfamilies. Thus, the eubacterial, mitochondrial, and pox viral resolving enzymes are grouped in the integrase superfamily, whereas the archaeal and bacteriophage T7 enzymes are members of the nuclease superfamily (11Lilley D.M.J. White M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9351-9353Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 12Aravind L. Makarova K.S. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3417-3432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the large volume of structural and biochemical data available for these enzymes, we do not fully understand how they work at a molecular level. In particular, the mechanism of the molecular recognition of the DNA junction structure by the enzymes is completely unknown. Resolving enzymes such as RuvC, Hjc, and T4 endonuclease VII all have extensive, fairly flat, highly basic surfaces that are presumed to interact with the highly acidic branched DNA substrates and clearly defined active sites positioned to allow phosphodiester bond cleavage on each side of the four-way junction. In addition, all of the enzymes studied to date manipulate the global and local structure of the junction on binding (reviewed in Ref. 2Lilley D.M.J. White M.F. Nature Reviews Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, in the absence of the crystal structure of a resolving enzyme-junction complex, the molecular details of such interactions and the nature and extent of DNA distortion in the complex remain obscure. Kinetic analysis of four-way junction cleavage by resolving enzymes has typically taken the form of pseudo-first order experiments in which the enzyme is present in a molar excess with respect to the junction substrate (13Schofield M.J. Lilley D.M.J. White M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7733-7740Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 14Fogg J. Schofield M.J. White M.F. Lilley D.M.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11349-11358Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Although these experiments have proven useful in determining the sequence specificity of the resolving enzymes, they clearly do not represent conditions in vivo. Resolving enzymes are generally expressed at very low levels in host cells, and they function in a cellular milieu that contains very high concentrations of nucleic acid and architectural DNA-binding proteins. The Hjc protein is responsible for the major junction-resolving activity found in the archaea (6Kvaratskhelia M. Wardleworth B.N. White M.F. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and is probably the cellular resolving enzyme analogous to the RuvC endonuclease in E. coli. Hjc is a dimer of 143-amino acid subunits inSulfolobus solfataricus with an N-terminal catalytic domain that is homologous to a superfamily of nucleases including the type II restriction enzymes typified by EcoRV. Four catalytic residues conserved between Hjc and EcoRV, Glu-12, Asp-42, Asp-55, and Lys-57, have been shown to be essential for catalytic activity (15Komori K. Sakae S. Daiyasu H. Toh H. Morikawa K.

The three acidic residues act as ligands for the catalytic metal ions (either magnesium or manganese), whereas Lys-57 is thought to help stabilize the transition state during phosphodiester bond cleavage. Hjc cleaves Holliday junctions on opposing strands three nucleotides 3′ of the point of strand exchange and manipulates the global and local structure of the bound junction into an X shape with distortion of base pairing around the site of cleavage (16Kvaratskhelia M. Wardleworth B.N. Norman D.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25540-25546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The structures of Hjc from Pyrococcus furiosus and S. solfataricus have been solved recently (17Bond C.S. Kvaratskhelia M. Richard D. White M.F. Hunter W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 1: 1Google Scholar, 18Nishino T. Komori K. Tsuchiya D. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 2001; 9: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and have confirmed the relationship of the enzyme with the nuclease superfamily. In this study, we investigate the activity of Sulfolobus Hjc under conditions approximating those found in vivo. In the course of this work, we uncovered an unexpected autoinhibitory feature of Hjc, which we have defined at a molecular level using a variety of biophysical techniques. We find that both double-stranded DNA and the archaeal dsDNA1-binding protein Sso7d can ameliorate this inhibitory phenomenon. The results demonstrate that caution should be applied when attempting to draw conclusions about the activity of junction-resolving enzymes based on simplified assay systems. Recombinant Hjc was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) Codon Plus RIL (Stratagene), and the protein was purified as described previously (19Kvaratskhelia M. White M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In brief, E. coli lysate containing recombinant Hjc was first subjected to SP-Sepharose high performance 26/10 column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) using Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and a linear elution gradient of 0–1m NaCl. Hjc activity peak fractions were concentrated and loaded onto a 26/70 gel filtration column (Superdex 200 Hi-Load, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) that was developed with Buffer A containing 300 mm NaCl. Major protein absorbance peak fractions were pooled and shown by SDS-PAGE to contain essentially homogeneous Hjc protein. This enzyme was used for all subsequent analyses. The concentration of Hjc was estimated using the extinction coefficient Ε280 (1 mg/ml) = 0.16 calculated from the amino acid composition of the protein. TheS. solfataricus P2 biomass was supplied by Dr. Neil Raven, Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research, Porton Down, UK. Cell lysis, centrifugation, and chromatography steps were carried out at 4 °C. 50 g of cells was thawed in 150 ml of lysis buffer and immediately sonicated for 5 × 1 min with cooling. The lysate was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was diluted 4-fold with Buffer A and applied to an SP-Sepharose High Performance 26/10 column (Hi-Load, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) equilibrated with Buffer A. A 500-ml linear gradient comprising 0 to 1000 mm NaCl was used to elute cationic proteins. Fractions containing Sso7d were identified by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant Sso7d protein. The relevant fractions were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a 26/70 gel filtration column (Superdex 200 Hi-Load, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and developed with Buffer A containing 300 mm NaCl. Fractions containing Sso7d were pooled and coincided with a single, essentially homogeneous polypeptide observed by SDS-PAGE. The protein identity was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. The concentration of Sso7d was estimated using the extinction coefficient Ε280 (1 mg/ml) = 1.15 calculated from the amino acid composition of the protein. Oligonucleotide synthesis and annealing of four-way DNA junctions and dsDNA were carried out as described previously (20White M.F. Lilley D.M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) using the sequences below (all written 5′ to 3′). Junction Z28, a fixed junction containing 15-bp arms, was prepared with the following oligonucleotides: b strand, TCCGTCCTAGCAAGGAGTCTGCTACCGGAA; h strand, TTCCGGTAGCAGACTAAAAGGTGGTTGAAT; r strand, ATTCAACCACCTTTTTTTTAACTGCAGCAG; x strand, CTGCTGCAGTTAAAACCTTGCTAGGACGGA. For dsDNA, a 39-bp DNA duplex was used for isothermal titration calorimetry studies and was prepared with the following oligonucleotides: top strand, CAGGAAAAGATGCATCTCATATGACAGAGGTGTTTCTCG; complement, CGAGAAACACCTCTGTCATATGAGATGCATCTTTTCCTG. Fluorescent four-way junction species were constructed as described (21Fogg J.M. Kvaratskhelia M. White M.F. Lilley D.M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 751-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using the following four oligonucleotides with fluorescein and Cy-3 labels as appropriate: b strand, CCTCCGTCCTAGCAAGGGGCTGCTACCGGAAGGG; h strand, CCCTTCCGGTAGCAGCCTGAGCGGTGGTTGAAGG; r strand, CCTTCAACCACCGCTCAACTCAACTGCAGTCTGG; x strand, CCAGACTGCAGTTGAGTCCTTGCTAGGACGGAGG. ITC experiments were carried out using a VP-ITC device (MicroCal, Northampton, MA). All solutions were degassed. Hjc and DNA samples were extensively dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 200 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2. The binding experiments were performed at 25 °C, under which no hydrolysis of the junction by thermophilic Hjc was detected. A 370-μl syringe with stirring at 400 rpm was used to titrate Hjc into a cell containing ∼1.4 ml of DNA solutions. Each titration consisted of a preliminary 1-μl injection followed by up to 30 subsequent 10-μl injections. Calorimetric data were analyzed using MicroCal ORIGIN software. All measurements of binding parameters presented are the means of at least duplicate experiments. The specific cleavage of 5′-32P-labeled four-way junction (100 nm) by Hjc was assayed in the presence or absence of 120 μg/ml competitor calf thymus DNA (Sigma) by first forming Hjc-junction complexes in the binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mmNaCl) and then initiating hydrolysis by the addition of 15 mm MgCl2 and incubating at 55 °C for 1 min. The reactions were stopped by adding a formamide/EDTA loading mix and heating to 95 °C for 5 min. Products were analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging as described previously and quantified by calculating the logarithm of the ratio of total:uncut substrate (13Schofield M.J. Lilley D.M.J. White M.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7733-7740Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). 5′-32P-labeled four-way junction (100 nm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of Hjc in the binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl) in the presence or absence of 120 μg/ml competitor calf thymus DNA in 10 μl of total volume. After a 5-min incubation at 20 °C, 2 μl of the loading buffer (0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol FF, 15% Ficoll type 400) was added to the samples. Hjc-junction complexes were separated with 5% polyacrylamide gels in Tris borate-EDTA buffer. After electrophoresis, gels were dried on Whatman No. 3MM paper and exposed to x-ray film for documentation or to phosphorimaging screens for quantitation. FRET data were recorded on an SLM-Aminco 8100 fluorometer and processed as described in Ref. 21Fogg J.M. Kvaratskhelia M. White M.F. Lilley D.M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 751-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar. We have shown previously that Hjc can form multiple complexes with a four-way DNA junction, as judged by electrophoretic retardation analysis, with at least two distinct complexes apparent that may correspond to one and two dimers of Hjc respectively bound to each junction (19Kvaratskhelia M. White M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study, we set out to characterize the activity of the enzyme in more detail and to investigate activity under conditions approaching thosein vivo. We first examined the effect of increasing concentrations of Hjc on the junction-resolving activity (Fig.1). Titration of Hjc against a fixed concentration of 100 nm junction resulted in a biphasic rate curve with maximal activity at 400 nm Hjc dimer. Cleavage activity was strongly inhibited above 400 nm Hjc, reducing to 1% of the maximal rate at 2 μm Hjc. Parallel analysis of the enzyme-junction complexes formed was carried out by electrophoretic retardation analysis. Titration of Hjc into the junction resulted in formation of a complex (complex I) corresponding to one dimer of Hjc bound per junction, reaching a maximum level at 400 nm Hjc, which is in good agreement with the conditions under which maximal enzyme activity was observed. Further increases in the enzyme concentration led to the formation of more highly retarded complexes corresponding to larger protein:DNA ratios. Comparison of the gel electrophoretic retardation and activity data (Fig. 1, Aand B) revealed that the initial accumulation of complex I was associated with the greatest junction-resolving activity of Hjc, whereas formation of higher complexes had a detrimental effect on the enzyme activity. We next examined the effect of the competitor duplex DNA on the Hjc-junction complex formation and catalytic activity. The presence of a large excess of calf thymus dsDNA competitor over radioactively labeled junction substrate resulted in a reduction but not abolition of the binding affinity of Hjc for the junction, as has been observed previously for the resolving enzymes (2Lilley D.M.J. White M.F. Nature Reviews Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). In the presence of 120 μg/ml duplex DNA competitor, the peak activity was shifted to relatively higher concentrations of Hjc (1 μm, Fig. 1D). Again, we observed a good correlation between complex I formation and the specific activity. Comparison of the activity data in the absence (Fig. 1B) and presence (Fig.1D) of dsDNA demonstrated that the highest activity levels detected for Hjc were found in the presence of competitor DNA. In general, higher catalytic activities were observed at a wider range of Hjc concentrations when competitor DNA was present in the reaction mix. Comparable results were obtained using circular or linearized plasmid DNA as a competitor (data not shown). Although the biochemical study of nucleases and other DNA-modifying enzymes is almost always carried out with “naked” DNA, in vivo the DNA is decorated extensively with architectural DNA-binding proteins that function to compact the genetic material and regulate its accessibility to other proteins. In eukaryotes, this role is undertaken primarily by the nucleosome, but histone proteins are absent from the crenarchaea (22Sandman K. Reeve J.N. Arch. Microbiol. 2000; 173: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Instead,Sulfolobus has an abundant dsDNA-binding protein, Sso7d, that is thought to coat the genomic DNA, providing protection against thermal denaturation (23Agback P. Baumann H. Knapp S. Ladenstein R. Hard T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The addition of Sso7d protein to cleavage assays with an Hjc concentration of 1 μmresulted in a dramatic stimulation of junction cleavage activity (Fig.2) with an increase in activity of approximately 2 orders of magnitude at 450 μm Sso7d, the highest concentration tested. ITC allows a quantitative analysis of protein-ligand interactions in solution. We have previously utilized ITC to study the interaction of the yeast junction-resolving enzyme Cce1 with a four-way DNA junction (24Kvaratskhelia M. George S. Cooper A. White M.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16613-16619Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In that case, ITC provided complementary and in some respects superior data for the study of protein-DNA interactions as compared with gel electrophoretic retardation analysis because ITC allowed the quantitative analysis of weaker protein-DNA interactions at the high magnesium ion concentrations required for maximal endonuclease activity. In the present study, we examined the binding of Hjc to a four-way DNA junction in the presence of magnesium ions (Fig.3). Interestingly, thermal titration curves displayed a complex shape, indicating that multiple Hjc dimers were binding to the junction. The best fit for the integrated heat data was obtained using a three sequential-binding sites model. Two consecutive endothermic binding events were followed by the exothermic binding of a third Hjc dimer. Using this model, theKD for the first Hjc dimer was 115 ± 25 nm with subsequent dimers exhibiting lower affinity for the junction. This observation complements the gel electrophoretic data (Fig. 1), suggesting that multiple dimers of Hjc can also bind a single DNA junction in the presence of magnesium ions. We next examined the binding of Hjc to a double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide. Again, we observed that multiple Hjc dimers were bound to this DNA species (Fig. 3). However, comparison of the two binding thermograms immediately revealed a marked difference. The first higher affinity endothermic binding event detected with the Hjc-junction interaction was clearly absent in the Hjc-dsDNA interaction. This difference is due presumably to the specific binding of Hjc to the branch point of the junction in complex I. The binding of the higher complexes of Hjc to the junction molecule is reminiscent of that of Hjc-dsDNA interactions, suggesting that higher complexes of Hjc are accommodated on the double-stranded arms of the junction. We have shown previously, by both gel electrophoretic retardation analysis (16Kvaratskhelia M. Wardleworth B.N. Norman D.G. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25540-25546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and FRET (21Fogg J.M. Kvaratskhelia M. White M.F. Lilley D.M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 751-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), that the conformation of four-way DNA junctions is significantly altered upon the binding of one dimer of Hjc. A fixed four-way junction (Junction 3) in complex with Hjc adopted an X-shaped 2-fold symmetrical structure with the B/H arms and R/X arms subtending acute angles (Fig.4A). In the present study, we addressed the question of whether higher complexes can further distort the junction conformation. We therefore repeated FRET experiments in the presence of a large molar excess of Hjc dimer over the DNA junction. The data obtained for Hjc concentrations higher than those of the junction displayed striking differences from those obtained under equimolar conditions (Fig. 4). In particular, the significant increase in FRET for BH and RX vectors indicated that these arms were driven closer in the higher Hjc complexes. The fluorescence anisotropy of fluorescein was unchanged in the presence of a large excess of Hjc, indicating that the mobility of the donor was unaffected by Hjc binding and suggesting that the increase in FRET efficiency was likely to be due to a shortening of the end-to-end distances. Similarities in the crystal packing of two crystal forms ofS. solfataricus Hjc (17Bond C.S. Kvaratskhelia M. Richard D. White M.F. Hunter W.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 1: 1Google Scholar) and comparison with the P. furiosus Hjc structure (18Nishino T. Komori K. Tsuchiya D. Ishino Y. Morikawa K. Structure. 2001; 9: 197-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) offer a plausible explanation for the observed concentration-dependent inactivation. Both hexagonal and cubic crystal forms of Hjc contain similar crystal contacts involving loops between strands D-E and H-I (Fig.5). These strands form a pair of pincers that interact with the equivalent residues from a partner subunit. This part of the molecule comprises the region of largest deviation between the Sulfolobus and Pyrococcus Hjc structures. Furthermore, the residue at which the deviation begins, at the N-terminal end of strand D, is the catalytically implicated Lys-57. It is conceivable that this interaction is responsible for the autoinactivation of Hjc at elevated concentrations. The observations that the same fold is observed in two unrelated crystal forms, accompanied by an increase in the secondary structure of the relevant loops and that one of the major components of the interaction is an otherwise exposed hydrophobic residue, Ile-62, suggest that it is a conserved rather than a fortuitous interaction. We have shown that several dimers of the Holliday junction-resolving enzyme Hjc can bind to a single synthetic four-way junction in vitro. In addition to targeting the junction specifically to form an enzyme-substrate complex, further molecules of Hjc can associate, probably through a combination of DNA-protein and protein-protein interactions. These higher order complexes are inhibitory to DNA cleavage, possibly because of the extreme distortion of the four-way junction conformation (Fig. 4). Inhibition can be relieved either by adding duplex DNA competitor or by the dsDNA-binding protein Sso7d. At a molecular level, Sso7d probably competes with extra molecules of Hjc for binding sites on the duplex DNA arms, thus preventing the formation of inhibitory complexes, whereas competitor duplex DNA may “soak up” the extra Hjc molecules that would otherwise bind on the duplex arms of the junction. We do not see a synergistic effect when both duplex DNA and Sso7d protein are added to Hjc cleavage reactions, which makes sense if both are functioning to relieve Hjc inhibition through essentially the same mechanism. The crystal structure of Sulfolobus Hjc gives a strong indication as to how Hjc dimers might interact with one another through a pair of interlocking loops to generate larger complexes. What we do not yet know is whether this secondary interface has a functional role. It may, for example, represent a means by which the nuclease activity of Hjc is repressed in the absence of Holliday junctions to ensure that a nonspecific cleavage of phosphodiester bonds does not occur. If so, this mechanism is presumably not shared by Pyrococcus Hjc because the interaction surface does not exist for that enzyme. Mutagenesis studies are under way to assess the importance of the secondary interface for the structure and function ofSulfolobus Hjc. In conclusion, the reconstitution of an approximation for archaeal chromatin in vitro has a significant influence on the activity of the Hjc enzyme. These observations highlight the complexity of DNA-protein interactions in vivo in which DNA is tightly packaged in chromatin and in which structures such as Holliday junctions must constitute a tiny proportion of the total nucleic acid present. Similar situations may be encountered for other enzymes that recognize a particular DNA structure or sequence during DNA replication, transcription, or repair, and there is evidence that chromatin structure can modulate DNA repair pathways both in vitro and in vivo (reviewed in Ref. 25Thoma F.

In the present study, we report the design and characterization of two novel radioligands derived from BgK,125I-BgK(W5Y/Y26F) and125I-BgK(W5Y/F6A/Y26F).125I-BgK(W5Y/Y26F) displays the same affinity and specificity toward Kv1 channel subtypes as BgK, whereas125I-BgK(W5Y/F6A/Y26F) displays a different and unique selectivity profile.

Given its unique binding properties, 125I-BgK(W5Y/F6A/Y26F) represents a new pharmacological tool for studying subpopulations of Kv1 channels in native tissues. Plasmids were amplified in Escherichia coli XL1Blue or DH5α and purified using the plasmid purification kit from Qiagen (maxi protocol). cDNA encoding hKv1.2 in pGEMA was provided by Prof. Stephan Grissmer (Department of Applied Physiology, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany). After introduction of two cloning sites by PCR (5′ BamHI and 3′ XbaI), the cDNA was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/HisC (Invitrogen). The resulting construct, whose integrity was assessed by nucleotide sequencing, encodes a channel with an N-terminal polyhistidine tag/epitope. To construct a cDNA coding for a Kv1.1-Kv1.2 dimer, human Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 DNAs were amplified from linearized plasmids with the primers CGATAGCTAGCACGCCACCATGACGGTGATGTCTGGGGAAG/CGATGGATCCCTGTTGCTGTTGCTGTTGCTGTTGCTGTTGAACATCGGTCAGTAGCTTGCTCTTATTAAC (hKv1.1), and GCATGGATCCATGACAGTGGCCACCGGAGACC/GCATCTCGAGTCAGACATCAGTTAACATTTTGG (hKv1.2), respectively. The resulting PCR fragment for Kv1.1 had a unique restriction site 5′ to ATG. The stop codon at the 3′ end was replaced by a glutamine codon, followed by a stretch of nine additional glutamine codons. After the last glutamine codon, a uniqueBamHI site was introduced, which added two additional amino acids (Gly, Ser) to the linker between Kv1.1 and Kv1.2. The PCR fragment for Kv1.2 had a BamHI site immediately before the ATG codon and a unique restriction site at the 3′ end.

The PCR fragments were restriction-digested, gel-purified, and ligated into the pCI-neo vector (Promega). The ligation reaction was transformed in XL1Blue bacteria.

Two additions of 10 μl of a 50,000-fold dilution of 30% hydrogen peroxide (w/w) were carried out, at 1-min intervals. At the end of the 2-min incubation period, the reaction was stopped by addition of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and the reaction mixture was injected onto a C18 column (Vydac, 4.6 × 250 mm) equilibrated with 20% solvent B (50% acetonitrile, 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid) in solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). A 40-min linear gradient of either 20–40% (BgK) or 25–60% (αDTX) solvent B in solvent A, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, led to the isolation of one nonradioactive and two radioactive species. Using nonradioactive iodine, these species were characterized by mass spectrometry. The first peak corresponds to native peptide, whereas the second and third peak represent the monoiodo- and diodo-derivatives of the peptide, respectively.

The two BgK analogs were radiolabeled with 125INa and their monoiodo-derivatives used in radioligand binding studies using either heterologous expressed channels or channels present in native tissues. The ability of BgK peptides to interact with homomultimeric Kv1 channels was determined in radioligand binding studies using 125I-αDTX or125I-HgTX1(A19Y/Y37F) (18Koschak A. Bugianesi R.M.

Under identical experimental conditions, 125I-HgTX1(A19Y/Y37F) binds to Kv1.3 channels with a Kd of 0.3 ± 0.04 pm (n = 3). TableI presents the results of competition experiments in which BgK analogs were evaluated for their ability to inhibit binding of these radioligands to homomultimeric Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, or Kv1.6 channels. BgK(W5Y/Y26F) inhibits binding of125I-αDTX to Kv1.1, Kv1.2, or Kv1.6 channels withKi values of 104 ± 6, 369 ± 17, and 14 ± 8 pm, respectively.

Iodination of BgK(W5Y/Y26F) results in a peptide,125I-BgK(W5Y/Y26F), that displays a binding capacity of 87–89% as determined in an analysis of specific bindingversus protein concentration using rat brain synaptosomal membranes (data not shown). 25I-BgK(W5Y/Y26F) binds with picomolar affinities to Kv1.1 (Kd = 35 ± 18 pm (n = 3)), Kv1.2 (Kd = 77 ± 18 pm(n = 3)), and Kv1.6 channels (Kd = 4 ± 1 pm (n = 3)) (Table I), but no specific binding was detected with homomultimeric Kv1.3 channels. Consistent with previous results using BgK(F6A) (21Alessandri-Haber N. Lecoq A. Gasparini S. Grangier-Macmath G. Jacquet G. Harvey A.L. de Medeiros C. Rowan E.G. Gola M. Ménez A. Crest M. J. Biol.

The affinity of BgK(W5Y/F6A/Y26F) for Kv1.6 and Kv1.1 channels is, however, not much different from that of BgK(W5Y/Y26F). As a consequence, the potency of BgK(W5Y/F6A/Y26F) for either Kv1.1 or Kv1.6 channels (Ki values of 215 ± 11 and 162 ± 74 pm, respectively) is 3 orders of magnitude higher than for Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 channels (289,200 ± 11,200 and 134,400 ± 200 pm, respectively). Iodination of BgK(W5Y/F6A/Y26F) yields a peptide,125I-BgK(W5Y/F6A/Y26F), that displays a binding capacity of 87% as determined using the same procedure described above for 125I-BgK(W5Y/Y26F) (data not shown).125I-BgK(W5Y/F6A/Y26F) binds to Kv1.1 and Kv1.6 channels with Kd values of 88 ± 32 pm(n = 3), or 70 ± 27 pm(n = 3), respectively (Fig.1, Table I), but no specific binding of the ligand can be detected with either Kv1.2 or Kv1.3 channels. It has recently been shown that substitution of Ala at position 6 alters the affinity of BgK for a Kv1.1 channel in which Tyr379, the residue that confers high sensitivity to inhibition by extracellular tetraethylammonium ion, is replaced by His, the corresponding residue present in Kv1.3 (30Racapé J. Recherche et Analyse des Éléments Moléculaires par Lesquels les Toxines Animales Lı̀ent les Canaux Kv1. Université Paris-Sud, Paris2001Google Scholar). These data suggest that the nature of the residue at that position could be a major determinant in the interaction of BgK(W5Y/F6A/Y26F) with Kv1 channels. To examine this in further detail, we determined the ability of BgK and its analogs to inhibit 125I-HgTX1(A19Y/Y37F) binding to a Kv1.3 mutant, Kv1.3(H399Y), in which His was replaced by the corresponding residue, Tyr, present in Kv1.1. Results of these experiments are presented in Table I and Fig.2 (A and B). Modification of this single residue in Kv1.3 is sufficient for enhancing the affinity of both BgK and BgK(W5Y/Y26F) by 30–40-fold (Ki values of 23.5 ± 1.9 and 44 ± 4 pm, respectively). These values are similar to those of Kv1.1 channels (Table I). Moreover, the difference in affinity between BgK(W5Y/F6A/Y26F) and BgK(W5Y/Y26F) for Kv1.3(H399Y) is 3–4-fold (Ki values of 171 ± 5 and 44 ± 4 pm, respectively), whereas it is 75-fold for Kv1.3. A double-mutant cycle analysis (31Hidalgo P. MacKinnon R. Science. 1995; 268: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) of the effects of the two substitutions, F6A in BgK (W5Y/Y26F) and H399Y in Kv1.3, yields a coupling coefficient, Ω = 19.1, corresponding to a coupling energy of 1.74 kcal/mol (Fig. 2C). This finding indicates that the two positions are not independent; the effect of F6A substitution in BgK (W5Y/Y26F) depends on the nature of the residue at the position that determines sensitivity of the channel to external tetraethylammonium. These results are consistent with data that indicate that the affinity of BgK(W5Y/F6A/Y26F) for Kv1.6, which also possesses a Tyr residue at the equivalent position, is only 10-fold lower than that of BgK(W5Y/Y26F), but is much more reduced for Kv1.2, which possesses a valine residue at that position (Table I). In contrast to results obtained with Kv1.3 channels,125I-BgK(W5Y/Y26F) binds to Kv1.3(H399Y) with aKd of 40 ± 3 pm (n= 4) (Fig. 2D, Table I). The affinity of125I-BgK(W5Y/F6A/Y26F) for Kv1.3(H399Y) could not be accurately measured because of high levels of nonspecific binding. Given that BgK(W5Y/Y26F) and BgK(W5Y/F6A/Y26F) differ in their pharmacological profile toward homomultimeric Kv1 channel subtypes, we then evaluated the effects of these peptides on heteromeric channels present in rat brain synaptic membranes. 125I-BgK(W5Y/Y26F) binds to a single class of sites with a Kd of 4.5 ± 1 pm and a Bmax of 2.7 ± 0.3 pmol/mg of protein (n = 4) (Fig.3A). Using the same membrane preparation, and under the same experimental conditions,125I-αDTX binds to a single class of sites (Bmax value of 2.6 ± 0.7 pmol/mg of protein) with a Kd of 3.5 ± 1.7 pm(n = 5), a value virtually identical to that published previously (25Gasparini S.

Binding of both 125I-BgK(W5Y/Y26F) and125I-αDTX to brain membranes is sensitive to inhibition by αDTX, BgK, BgK(W5Y/Y26F), and BgK(W5Y/F6A/Y26F), andKi values for these peptides are similar regardless of the radioligand used (Table II). These data indicate that the concentration of binding sites labeled by both125I-BgK(W5Y/Y26F) and 125I-αDTX, as well as the affinities of these sites for αDTX, BgK, BgK(W5Y/Y26F), and BgK(W5Y/F6A/Y26F) are similar and suggest that both radioligands bind to the same receptor population in rat brain membranes. DTX-K inhibits binding of 125I-BgK(W5Y/Y26F) (Fig.4A) and125I-αDTX (data not shown) with Hill coefficients lower than 1, indicating that this peptide distinguishes between several subpopulations of these receptors. These data are consistent with previous observations suggesting that 125I-αDTX receptors do not form a homogeneous population (14Scott V.E.S. Muniz Z.M. Sewing S. Lichtinghagen R. Parcej D.N.

At least three studies have sought to measure the reactivity of superoxide (O⨪2) toward S-nitrosothiols, all involving xanthine or hypoxanthine with xanthine oxidase to generate the radical. The results present a confusing picture. Aleryani et al. (14Aleryani S. Milo E. Rose Y. Kostka P. J. Biol.

They also reported that in the absence of oxygen, S-nitrosocysteine (but not GSNO) was a substrate for xanthine oxidase, which is a possible complication. In similar studies, Jourd'hueil et al.

This corresponds to a second-order rate constant k1of 0.6–1.2 × 106m−1s−1 at [GSNO] = 1 mm, as used in the experiments by Trujillo et al. (18Trujillo M. Alvarez M.N. Peluffo G. Freeman B.A. Radi R.

Ignoring the temperature differences, estimates of k1 thus range from about 104–106m−1s−1. We have used radiolysis to generate O⨪2 at a variable, steady rate and have derived an estimate of k1 based on the competition between Reaction 1 and the uncatalyzed disproportionation, Reaction 2,2O⨪2+2H+→H2O2+O2REACTION2The rate constant of the latter varies with pH and has been very reliably characterized by pulse radiolysis and other direct methods (20Bielski B.H.J. Cabelli D.E. Arudi R.L. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 1985; 14: 1041-1100Crossref Scopus (1813) Google Scholar). In addition, we have examined by direct observation whether reductive cleavage of GSNO by the carbon dioxide radical anion (CO⨪2) produces nitric oxide (Reaction 3) or thiyl radicals and nitroxyl (Reaction 4),GSNO+CO⨪2(+H+)→GSH+NO⋅+CO2REACTION3GSNO+CO⨪2(+H+)→GS⋅+NO−(HNO)+CO2REACTION4We used CO⨪2 as a model reductant because it has reducing properties approximately equivalent to the most reactive of biological reductants, disulfide radical anions, cf. E0(CO2/CO⨪2) approximately −1.9 V and Em7(RSSR/(RSSR)⨪) approximately −1.7 V versus NHE (21Wardman P. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 1989; 18: 1637-1755Crossref Scopus (1750) Google Scholar). All chemicals were of the highest grade available. GSH and HCl were purchased from Aldrich; sodium formate, EDTA, and ABTS2− (diammonium salt) were from Sigma; sodium nitrite, formic acid, and buffers were from Merck. Gases were from British Oxygen Co.; zero grade N2O was passed through Oxysorb (Messer Griesheim) to remove O2. GSH (1.53 g) was dissolved in HCl (8 ml, 0.625 m) on ice, and NaNO2 (0.345 g) was added with vigorous stirring and left for 40 min. The red precipitate was filtered after adding acetone (8 ml), washed with ice-cold water (5 × 10 ml), acetone (3 × 10 ml), and ether (3 × 10 ml), dried in vacuo at 4 °C overnight, and stored at −20 °C. The purity was estimated at 98% from the absorbance at 335 nm of a solution (1 mm) in HCl (0.5 m) (ε = 922 m−1 cm−1(22Hart T.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 2013-2016Crossref Scopus (381) Google Scholar)). Radiolysis of O2-saturated water containing sodium formate (0.1m) with formic acid (0.02 m) for pH < 4.8 was used to produce O⨪2 with a yield of 0.68 μmol J−1 (0.68 μm Gy−1) (17Ross A.B. Mallard W.G.

All solutions contained EDTA (0.1 mm) and phosphate buffer (10 mm) except for pH < 4.8. A60Co source of γ-rays giving dose rates of ∼0.017–0.14 Gy s−1 produced O⨪2 at ∼0.01–0.1 μm s−1 in sealed spectrophotometer cells with a 4-cm path length (O2 was not replenished by bubbling after the initial saturation). The primary water radicals, e aq−, ⋅OH, and ⋅H, are converted to O⨪2 within ∼1 μs after production (see below) (17Ross A.B. Mallard W.G. Helman W.P. Buxton G.V. Huie R.E. Neta P.

Solutions contained sodium formate/formic acid (0.1/0.02 m) and were saturated with N2O, with which radiolytically produced e aq− reacted to produce ⋅OH and in turn CO⨪2 (17Ross A.B. Mallard W.G.

Single 0.2–0.5-μs pulses of ∼6-MeV electrons delivered a dose of ∼20 Gy to a 2-cm spectrophotometer cell. All solutions contained EDTA (0.1 mm). The thiyl radical from GSH was generated by pulse radiolysis (0.5 μs) of a N2O-saturated solution of GSH (0.5 mm) at pH 3.4. Superoxide radicals were generated by γ-radiolysis in solutions containing GSNO, and the loss of GSNO was determined from the decrease in absorbance at 335 nm. This assumes no products were formed that absorb significantly at this wavelength, as suggested by the uniform decrease in absorbance between ∼300 and 400 nm. The absorbance was stable over the time scale of the experiments in the absence of radiolysis. The shallow curves from the initial portion of the absorbance/time plots were fitted to a second-order polynomial, and the initial slope was obtained from the linear coefficient to obtain the radiolytic yield of GSNO decomposition, G(−GSNO). These were compared with the production of O⨪2(G(O⨪2) = 0.68 μmol J−1). The exponential bleaching at 335 nm was measured after producing CO⨪2 (∼11 μm) by pulse radiolysis (0.5 μs) in solutions containing 100–300 μm GSNO. The exponential decay of the absorption of e aq− at 720 nm (∼0.37 μm, ε = 1.9 × 104m−1 cm−1) was measured after pulse radiolysis (0.2 μs) of N2-saturated solutions containing 0–27 μm GSNO and 2-methyl-propan-2-ol (17 mm, to scavenge ⋅OH), pH 7.0 (phosphate, 1 mm). A Hewlett-Packard HP8453 diode array spectrophotometer was used for measurements of stable products. The equipment for spectrophotometry with sub-microsecond resolution used with pulse radiolysis has been described (24Candeias L.P. Folkes L.K. Dennis M.F. Patel K.B. Everett S.A. Stratford M.R.L. Wardman P. J. Phys. Chem. 1994; 98: 10131-10137Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Solutions were irradiated in 20-ml glass syringes without head space. Irradiations were up to 540 s at a dose rate of 0.066 Gy s−1, i.e. a rate of production of CO⨪2 of 45 nm s−1. Samples (40 μl) were injected into the purge vessel (containing 10 mm NaH2PO4) of a chemiluminescent analyzer (Sievers model 280). Calibration involved injecting 5–100 μl of diluted (×5000) NO⋅-saturated water (1.93 mm at 22 °C). The differential equations characterizing reactions were integrated numerically using FACSIMILE software (AEA Technology Ltd., version 3.0.33 running under Windows 2000). This uses algorithms appropriate to the equations characterizing reactions spanning a wide time scale (“stiff” differential equations). The yields of radicals ( e aq−, ⋅OH, and H⋅) were taken as 0.3, 0.3, and 0.06 μmol J−1(μm Gy−1) respectively. All experiments utilized water purified in a Millipore system using Milli-RO 8 and Milli-Q RG cartridges; solutions were at room temperature (22 ± 2 °C). The loss of GSNO was followed after generating superoxide radicals by radiolysis, irradiating for times up to around 1 h, and deriving the initial rates of loss from the shallow curves of absorbance versustime. Simulation (see below) demonstrated that concentrations of intermediates achieved steady states in a few 10s of seconds, and the curvature in the plots reflect secondary reactions involving products. Typical measurements are shown in Fig. 1(inset), which illustrates different rates of loss depending on initial [GSNO] and the superoxide generation rate (dose rate). The loss of GSNO, G(−GSNO), increased as the initial concentration of GSNO ([GSNO]0) increased (Fig.1), decreased as the superoxide generation rate increased (Fig. 2), and increased as the pH of the solution increased (Fig. 3). All of these changes are qualitatively consistent with the variations arising from the competition between Reaction 1 and Reaction 2. As [GSNO]0 increases, an increasing fraction of O⨪2 radicals are lost through Reaction 1 rather than disproportionation, Reaction 2. As the superoxide radical generation rate (dose rate) increases, the steady-state concentration of superoxide, [O⨪2]ss, increases and the rate of Reaction 2 relative to that of Reaction 1 increases. The lifetime of HO 2•/O⨪2 is at a minimum at pH = pK5 = 4.8 because the acid/base equilibrium, Reaction 5Figure 2Dependence on radiolysis dose rate (O⨪2 generation rate) of the rate of loss of GSNO after reaction with O⨪2 with [GSNO]0 = 88 μm at pH 6.4 (●).Solid line, simulation from FACSIMILE usingk1 = 300 m−1s−1; dashed lines, k1 = 200 or 400m−1 s−1 as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 3Dependence on pH of the rate of loss of GSNOafter reaction with O⨪2 with [GSNO]0 = 147 μm and O⨪2 generation rate of 48 nm s−1 (●).Solid line, simulation from FACSIMILE usingk1 = 300 m−1s−1; dashed lines,k1 = 200 or 400m−1 s−1 as indicated.

The reaction between HO 2• and O⨪2 is faster than that involving HO 2•/HO 2•, and O⨪2 is unreactive toward itself (20Bielski B.H.J. Cabelli D.E. Arudi R.L. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 1985; 14: 1041-1100Crossref Scopus (1813) Google Scholar). Hence, as pH is increased above 4.8, the lifetime of O⨪2 is increased and increasing pH thus favors Reaction 1. In a preliminary report of these data (25Atsipapa E. Wardman P. Hughes M.N. Nitric Oxide. 2000; 4: 278Google Scholar), an estimate ofk1 was derived using the steady-state approximation to enable the value of k1 to be calculated from the rate of loss of GSNO as shown in Equation1,(−d[GSNO]/dt)0=k1[GSNO]0[O⨪2]ssEquation 1 where [O⨪2]ss is the concentration of O⨪2 at a steady state, and to minimize complications from reactions between products the initial rate of change is estimated. For simplicity we use here [O⨪2] to denote the sum of [O⨪2] + [HO 2•] because the equilibrium, Reaction 5, is established much faster than the other reactions. If we assume NO⋅ is a product of Reaction 1 (see below), then the possibility that [O⨪2]ssis influenced by Reaction 6 has to be considered (17Ross A.B. Mallard W.G. Helman W.P. Buxton G.V. Huie R.E.

Sehested K. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 10047-10052Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar), which except at high conversion and/or pH is more important than reaction of NO 2· with GSH (28Atsipapa E. Candeias L.P. Hughes M.N. Wardman P. Nitric Oxide. 1998; 2: 306Google Scholar) in these experiments (see below). Significant interaction between NO⋅ and NO 2•, NO⋅ and O2, or HO 2•/O⨪2 and ONOOH/ONOO− can be discounted because of the low steady-state levels (see below) and/or known or possible rate constants. If k0 is the rate of generation of O⨪2, the steady-state approximation for [O⨪2] is given in Equation 2,d[O⨪2]/dt=k0−k1[O⨪2][GSNO]−2k9[O⨪2]2Equation 2 −k6[O⨪2][NO⋅]−k9[O⨪2][NO2•]=0The concentration of NO⋅ will also achieve a steady state rapidly (see below), assuming Reaction 1 produces NO⋅ (Equations3 and 4),d[NO⋅]/dt=k1[O⨪2][GSNO]−k6[O⨪2][NO⋅]=0Equation 3 [NO⋅]ss=k1[GSNO]/k6Equation 4 The steady-state concentration of NO 2· is similarly calculated by applying the steady-state approximation to both [NO 2·] and [ONOOH]. Again for simplicity denoting [ONOOH] = ([ONOOH] + [ONOO−]) because equilibrium (Reaction 7) will be established rapidly (EquationsEquation 5, Equation 6, Equation 7, Equation 8),d[NO2•]/dt=0.35k8[ONOOH]−k9[O⨪2][NO2•]=0Equation 5 [NO2•]ss=0.35k8[ONOOH]/(k9[O⨪2])Equation 6 d[ONOOH]/dt=k6[O⨪2][NO·]−k8[ONOOH]=0Equation 7 [ONOOH]ss=k6[O⨪2][NO·]/k8Equation 8 Substituting the expression for [NO⋅] from Equation4 in Equation 8 and substituting the resulting expression for [ONOOH] in Equation 6 yields Equation 9,[NO2•]ss=0.35k1[GSNO]/k9Equation 9 Making the substitutions from Equations 4 and 9 in Equation 2 we obtain the positive root of the quadratic as Equation 10,[O⨪2]ss={−2.35k1[GSNO]+[(2.35k1[GSNO])2+8k0k2]1/2}/4k2Equation 10 Equation 10 is then used with Equation 1 and measurements of (−d[GSNO]/dt)0 to estimatek1. A simple spreadsheet formula can be used to arrive at an iterative solution. A value of k1∼500 m−1 s−1 was obtained in a preliminary analysis (25Atsipapa E. Wardman P. Hughes M.N. Nitric Oxide. 2000; 4: 278Google Scholar). In the radiolysis system with formate as dominant scavenger, ⋅OH produced in Reaction 8 regenerates O⨪2, and Equations 2 and 10must be modified appropriately. With generation of O⨪2 using xanthine oxidase, GSNO, and/or the cofactor and/or any metal chelator added may scavenge ⋅OH, with less predictable consequences. Furthermore, a minor complication of the present study is that in experiments where only a fraction of O⨪2 radicals decay via reaction with GSNO, unwanted loss of GSNO via direct reactions of a small fraction of the radicals generated by radiolysis can approach significance. This can be assessed from competition kinetics if the rate constants of the competing reactions are known (Reactions 10–R13),eaq−+O2→O⨪2REACTION10eaq−+GSNO→productsREACTION11CO⨪2+O2→CO2+O2−REACTION12CO⨪2+GSNO→CO2+productsREACTION13In the present study, [O2]0/[GSNO]0 ≥8, and we foundk11 = k10 (see below),i.e. ≤11% e aq− react directly with GSNO rather than generate O⨪2. We foundk13 = k3 = 0.37k12 (see below), and so ≤4.5% CO⨪2react directly with GSNO rather than generate O⨪2. Rate constants for reaction of ⋅OH or H⋅ with GSNO were estimated to sufficient precision because k14 [HCO 2−] ≥150k15 [GSNO] and k16[HCO 2−] ≥70k17 [GSNO], assumingk15 or k17 are similar to reported values for reaction of ⋅OH with GSH (diffusion-controlled) or H⋅ with cysteine, respectively (17Ross A.B. Mallard W.G. Helman W.P. Buxton G.V. Huie R.E. Neta P. NDRL-NIST Solution Kinetics Database, Version 3. Notre Dame Radiation Laboratory and National Institute of Standards and Technology, Notre Dame, IN, and Gaithersburg, MD1998Google Scholar). Note H⋅ contributes only ∼9% to the total radical yield, so uncertainties over its reactivity are unimportant (see Reactions 14–R17).⋅OH+HCO2−→H2O+CO⨪2REACTION14⋅OH+GSNO→productsREACTION15H⋅+HCO2−→H2+CO⨪2REACTION16H⋅+GSNO→productsREACTION17All of Reactions 1–R17 were included in a reaction set for which the concentration/time curves were integrated numerically using FACSIMILE. Rate constants used are listed in TableI; the results are insensitive to likely uncertainties in all the rate constants other than that of Reaction 2, which is well established (20Bielski B.H.J. Cabelli D.E. Arudi R.L. J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data. 1985; 14: 1041-1100Crossref Scopus (1813) Google Scholar), and thus alternative values for rate constants from studies other than those referenced would have insignificant effects on the conclusions. The solid lines in Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 are those obtained from the simulations withk1 = 300 m−1s−1; the dashed lines represent simulations with k1 = 200 or 400m−1 s−1. Almost all the data points for the three experimental variations fit within the envelopek1 = 300 ± 100m−1 s−1; all are inconsistent with values of k1 ≥ 104m−s−1. In these simulations, the rate constant for the conjugate acid of superoxide, HO 2•, reacting with GSNO was initially set as 0. Fig. 3 additionally shows the different results expected at pH < 6 if HO 2• reacted with the same rate constant as O⨪2. The value of G(−GSNO) at the lowest pH, where reaction of O⨪2 with GSNO is least efficient, also illustrates the contribution from direct reaction of GSNO with e aq− and/or CO⨪2.Table IValues of rate constants and pKa used in reaction simulationsReactionk/m−1s−1 or pKaRef.13 × 102This work28.3 × 1051-aHO 2• + HO 2•.; 9.7 × 1071-bHO 2• + O⨪2.20Bielski B.H.J.

Open table in a new tab To illustrate the validity of the chemical-kinetic approximations and to assist discussion of previous observations (see below) and possible uncertainties, Fig. 4 shows some results of a FACSIMILE simulation of a model, non-radiolysis experiment where, typically, O⨪2 is generated at 0.1 μms−1 in the presence of GSNO (0.15 mm) at pH 7 assuming k1 = 300m−1 s−1. It is seen that [O⨪2], [NO⋅], [NO 2•], and [ONOOH]/[ONOO−] rapidly achieve steady states similar to those calculated using Equations 10, 4, 6, and 8, respectively. Thus Equations 4 and 10 yield [NO⋅]ss = 10.5 pm(simulation, 10.4 pm at 50 s) and [O⨪2]ss = 329 nm (simulation, 329 nm at 50 s), respectively. The initial rate of loss of GSNO is 14.7 nm s−1 in the simulation, compared with 14.8 nm s−1 calculated using Equations 1 and 10. A source of possible uncertainty is any other reactions of ONOOH/ONOO− that could reduce [O⨪2]ssbecause the steady-state concentrations of ONOOH/ONOO−reach a few tens of nanomolars in the simulation. However, adding possible reactions between ONOOH/ONOO− and HO 2•/O⨪2 to the model with all four rate constants equal to 1 × 106m−1 s−1 increased [GSNO] at 5000 s by only 1%. Peroxynitrite reacts with the presumed product of Reaction 1, GSH with a rate constant of 600m−1 s−1 at pH 7.5, 25 °C (31Koppenol W.H. Moreno J.J. Pryor W.A. Ischiropoulos H. Beckman J.S. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1992; 5: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). Including this secondary reaction in the simulation changed [GSNO] at 5000 s by <0.1%. Reactivity of ONOO− toward GSNO is likely to be lower than that toward GSH; the rate constant at pH 10 must be <50 m−1 s−1 because the decay of ONOO− was unaffected by 10−4m GSNO (32Mutus B. Redmond R.W. Akhter S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Including a hypothetical reaction of ONOO− with GSNO with a rate constant of 50m−1 s−1 decreased [GSNO] at 5000 s by 1%. The initial products of reduction of GSNO by the model reductant CO⨪2 were investigated. Fig. 5 (inset) shows the first-order rate constants for decay of GSNO after reduction by CO⨪2 under conditions where [CO⨪2]0 ≪ [GSNO]. The intercept of the plot at [GSNO]0 = 0 corresponds to the reaction CO⨪2 + CO⨪2 (17Ross A.B. Mallard W.G. Helman W.P. Buxton G.V. Huie R.E. Neta P. NDRL-NIST Solution Kinetics Database, Version 3.

https://openalex.org/W1978659978,"The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor mediates a two-sided response-cell proliferation and differentiation. This process, defined as ""branching morphogenesis,"" involves cell scatter and redistribution to form ramified hollow tubules within the extracellular matrix, and protection from apoptosis. We have fused the intracellular domain of the HGF receptor (HGFR) with three FK506-binding protein (FKBP) domains and a membrane-targeting signal. This molecule (FKBP-HGFR) dimerizes after administration of a bifunctional ligand specific for FKBP domains. We show that, in mouse hepatocyte progenitors, FKBP-HGFR dimerization elicits the differentiative side of the HGF response, including cell scatter, morphogenesis, and protection from apoptosis. Surprisingly, FKBP-HGFR does not induce cell proliferation. We could correlate the segregation of the differentiative response with a distinctive signaling kinetic of FKBP-HGFR: a) reduced and prolonged tyrosine kinase activation; and b) low early peak of MAP kinase activation (a log lower than the peak induced by the wild-type receptor), followed by a sustained activation over 6 h. These data show that the biological response triggered by the HGFR can be dissected on the basis of the quantitative signaling profile, and that FKBP-HGFR may be used to control selectively the differentiation of hepatocytes, without promoting cell expansion."
