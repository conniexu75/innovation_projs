https://openalex.org/W2620578070,"Breast cancer is one of the main causes of cancer death worldwide. The diagnosis of biopsy tissue with hematoxylin and eosin stained images is non-trivial and specialists often disagree on the final diagnosis. Computer-aided Diagnosis systems contribute to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of this process. Conventional classification approaches rely on feature extraction methods designed for a specific problem based on field-knowledge. To overcome the many difficulties of the feature-based approaches, deep learning methods are becoming important alternatives. A method for the classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained breast biopsy images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is proposed. Images are classified in four classes, normal tissue, benign lesion, in situ carcinoma and invasive carcinoma, and in two classes, carcinoma and non-carcinoma. The architecture of the network is designed to retrieve information at different scales, including both nuclei and overall tissue organization. This design allows the extension of the proposed system to whole-slide histology images. The features extracted by the CNN are also used for training a Support Vector Machine classifier. Accuracies of 77.8% for four class and 83.3% for carcinoma/non-carcinoma are achieved. The sensitivity of our method for cancer cases is 95.6%."
https://openalex.org/W2619008758,"Materials are described here that can change their crystalline phase in response to the electrically controlled insertion or extraction of oxygen and hydrogen ions, giving rise to three distinct phases with different optical, electrical and magnetic properties. Materials that change their phase in response to the electrical injection or extraction of an ionic species are harnessed in a wide range of applications, including batteries that can operate in a range of climates and smart windows that can control the amount of light or heat that passes through them. As Nianpeng Lu et al. report, increasing the number of transferrable ionic species can greatly enhance the functionality of the system. Specifically, they report a material system in which the electrical insertion and extraction of oxygen (O2−) and hydrogen (H+) ions can be independently controlled, giving reversible access to three distinct material phases that have very different optical, electrical and magnetic properties. This finding could further broaden the range of potential applications for phase-changing materials. Materials can be transformed from one crystalline phase to another by using an electric field to control ion transfer, in a process that can be harnessed in applications such as batteries1, smart windows2 and fuel cells3. Increasing the number of transferrable ion species and of accessible crystalline phases could in principle greatly enrich material functionality. However, studies have so far focused mainly on the evolution and control of single ionic species (for example, oxygen, hydrogen or lithium ions4,5,6,7,8,9,10). Here we describe the reversible and non-volatile electric-field control of dual-ion (oxygen and hydrogen) phase transformations, with associated electrochromic2 and magnetoelectric11 effects. We show that controlling the insertion and extraction of oxygen and hydrogen ions independently of each other can direct reversible phase transformations among three different material phases: the perovskite SrCoO3−δ (ref. 12), the brownmillerite SrCoO2.5 (ref. 13), and a hitherto-unexplored phase, HSrCoO2.5. By analysing the distinct optical absorption properties of these phases, we demonstrate selective manipulation of spectral transparency in the visible-light and infrared regions, revealing a dual-band electrochromic effect that could see application in smart windows2,9. Moreover, the starkly different magnetic and electric properties of the three phases—HSrCoO2.5 is a weakly ferromagnetic insulator, SrCoO3−δ is a ferromagnetic metal12, and SrCoO2.5 is an antiferromagnetic insulator13—enable an unusual form of magnetoelectric coupling, allowing electric-field control of three different magnetic ground states. These findings open up opportunities for the electric-field control of multistate phase transformations with rich functionalities."

https://openalex.org/W2619328883,"Anatomical models are important training and teaching tools in the clinical environment and are routinely used in medical imaging research. Advances in segmentation algorithms and increased availability of three-dimensional (3D) printers have made it possible to create cost-efficient patient-specific models without expert knowledge. We introduce a general workflow that can be used to convert volumetric medical imaging data (as generated by Computer Tomography (CT)) to 3D printed physical models. This process is broken up into three steps: image segmentation, mesh refinement and 3D printing. To lower the barrier to entry and provide the best options when aiming to 3D print an anatomical model from medical images, we provide an overview of relevant free and open-source image segmentation tools as well as 3D printing technologies. We demonstrate the utility of this streamlined workflow by creating models of ribs, liver, and lung using a Fused Deposition Modelling 3D printer."
https://openalex.org/W2617852583,"Microorganisms are often studied as populations but the behaviour of single, individual cells can have important consequences. For example, tuberculosis, caused by the bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, requires months of antibiotic therapy even though the bulk of the bacterial population dies rapidly. Shorter courses lead to high rates of relapse because subpopulations of bacilli can survive despite being genetically identical to those that are easily killed. In fact, mycobacteria create variability each time a cell divides, producing daughter cells with different sizes and growth rates. The mechanism(s) that underlie this high-frequency variation and how variability relates to survival of the population are unknown. Here we show that mycobacteria actively create heterogeneity. Using a fluorescent reporter and a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based transposon screen, we find that deletion of lamA, a gene of previously unknown function, decreases heterogeneity in the population by decreasing asymmetric polar growth. LamA has no known homologues in other organisms, but is highly conserved across mycobacterial species. We find that LamA is a member of the mycobacterial division complex (the 'divisome'). It inhibits growth at nascent new poles, creating asymmetry in polar growth. The kinetics of killing individual cells that lack lamA are more uniform and more rapid with rifampicin and drugs that target the cell wall. Our results show that mycobacteria encode a non-conserved protein that controls the pattern of cell growth, resulting in a population that is both heterogeneous and better able to survive antibiotic pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2619312983,"X-ray free-electron lasers enable the investigation of the structure and dynamics of diverse systems, including atoms, molecules, nanocrystals and single bioparticles, under extreme conditions. Many imaging applications that target biological systems and complex materials use hard X-ray pulses with extremely high peak intensities (exceeding 1020 watts per square centimetre). However, fundamental investigations have focused mainly on the individual response of atoms and small molecules using soft X-rays with much lower intensities. Studies with intense X-ray pulses have shown that irradiated atoms reach a very high degree of ionization, owing to multiphoton absorption, which in a heteronuclear molecular system occurs predominantly locally on a heavy atom (provided that the absorption cross-section of the heavy atom is considerably larger than those of its neighbours) and is followed by efficient redistribution of the induced charge. In serial femtosecond crystallography of biological objects-an application of X-ray free-electron lasers that greatly enhances our ability to determine protein structure-the ionization of heavy atoms increases the local radiation damage that is seen in the diffraction patterns of these objects and has been suggested as a way of phasing the diffraction data. On the basis of experiments using either soft or less-intense hard X-rays, it is thought that the induced charge and associated radiation damage of atoms in polyatomic molecules can be inferred from the charge that is induced in an isolated atom under otherwise comparable irradiation conditions. Here we show that the femtosecond response of small polyatomic molecules that contain one heavy atom to ultra-intense (with intensities approaching 1020 watts per square centimetre), hard (with photon energies of 8.3 kiloelectronvolts) X-ray pulses is qualitatively different: our experimental and modelling results establish that, under these conditions, the ionization of a molecule is considerably enhanced compared to that of an individual heavy atom with the same absorption cross-section. This enhancement is driven by ultrafast charge transfer within the molecule, which refills the core holes that are created in the heavy atom, providing further targets for inner-shell ionization and resulting in the emission of more than 50 electrons during the X-ray pulse. Our results demonstrate that efficient modelling of X-ray-driven processes in complex systems at ultrahigh intensities is feasible."

https://openalex.org/W2620868269,"Plant phenotypic plasticity determines plant adaptation to changing environments and agricultural productivity. Phytohormones are essential plant signalling molecules regulating this plasticity through complex signalling networks. Jasmonates (JAs) are key phytohormones regulating many aspects of growth, development and defence responses. An important role of JAs in tolerance to abiotic stresses is also emerging. The expression of JAZ (JASMONATE-ZIM-DOMAIN PROTEIN) genes, encoding for the key repressors in the JA-pathway, is regulated by multiple abiotic stresses, suggesting a role for the JAZ proteins in response to these stresses. The JAZ proteins belong to the TIFY family, well described in many plant species. However, only the role of few tomato JAZ proteins in response to microbial infection has been analysed so far. Here, we identify the members of the tomato TIFY family, and characterize them phylogenetically. In addition, we analyse the transcriptional regulation of several SlJAZ in response to abiotic stresses and hormone treatments both in root and leaves to assess their specific expression in response to stresses. Most SlJAZ are JA-induced and responsive to one or more abiotic stresses, providing clues for functional analysis of JAZ genes in abiotic responses in tomato."
https://openalex.org/W2617973969,"Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) performs multiple tasks in mRNA processing, transport, and translational regulation, but it also forms aggregates implicated in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. TDP-43's N-terminal domain (NTD) is important for these activities and dysfunctions; however, there is an open debate about whether or not it adopts a specifically folded, stable structure. Here, we studied NTD mutations designed to destabilize its structure utilizing NMR and fluorescence spectroscopies, analytical ultracentrifugation, splicing assays, and cell microscopy. The substitutions V31R and T32R abolished TDP-43 activity in splicing and aggregation processes, and even the rather mild L28A mutation severely destabilized the NTD, drastically reducing TDP-43's in vitro splicing activity and inducing aberrant localization and aggregation in cells. These findings strongly support the idea that a stably folded NTD is essential for correct TDP-43 function. The stably folded NTD also promotes dimerization, which is pertinent to the protein's activities and pathological aggregation, and we present an atomic-level structural model for the TDP-43 dimer based on NMR data. Leu-27 is evolutionarily well conserved even though it is exposed in the monomeric NTD. We found here that Leu-27 is buried in the dimer and that the L27A mutation promotes monomerization. In conclusion, our study sheds light on the structural and biological properties of the TDP-43 NTD, indicating that the NTD must be stably folded for TDP-43's physiological functions, and has implications for understanding the mechanisms promoting the pathological aggregation of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W2618197619,"Sample preparation is critical to biological electron microscopy (EM), and there have been continuous efforts on optimizing the procedures to best preserve structures of interest in the sample. However, a quantitative characterization of the morphological changes associated with each step in EM sample preparation is currently lacking. Using correlative EM and superresolution microscopy (SRM), we have examined the effects of different drying methods as well as osmium tetroxide (OsO4) post-fixation on cell morphology during scanning electron microscopy (SEM) sample preparation. Here, SRM images of the sample acquired under hydrated conditions were used as a baseline for evaluating morphological changes as the sample went through SEM sample processing. We found that both chemical drying and critical point drying lead to a mild cellular boundary retraction of ~60 nm. Post-fixation by OsO4 causes at least 40 nm additional boundary retraction. We also found that coating coverslips with adhesion molecules such as fibronectin prior to cell plating helps reduce cell distortion from OsO4 post-fixation. These quantitative measurements offer useful information for identifying causes of cell distortions in SEM sample preparation and improving current procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2619487621,"Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) are the only innervated airway epithelial cells. To what extent neural innervation regulates PNEC secretion and function is unknown. Here, we discover that neurotrophin 4 (NT4) plays an essential role in mucus overproduction after early life allergen exposure by orchestrating PNEC innervation and secretion of GABA. We found that PNECs were the only cellular source of GABA in airways. In addition, PNECs expressed NT4 as a target-derived mechanism underlying PNEC innervation during development. Early life allergen exposure elevated the level of NT4 and caused PNEC hyperinnervation and nodose neuron hyperactivity. Associated with aberrant PNEC innervation, the authors discovered that GABA hypersecretion was required for the induction of mucin Muc5ac expression. In contrast, NT4−/− mice were protected from allergen-induced mucus overproduction and changes along the nerve–PNEC axis without any defects in inflammation. Last, GABA installation restored mucus overproduction in NT4−/− mice after early life allergen exposure. Together, our findings provide the first evidence for NT4-dependent neural regulation of PNEC secretion of GABA in a neonatal disease model. Targeting the nerve–PNEC axis may be a valid treatment strategy for mucus overproduction in airway diseases, such as childhood asthma.—Barrios, J., Patel, K. R., Aven, L., Achey, R., Minns, M.

https://openalex.org/W2618470987,"Infiltration of macrophages and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) promote the development of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Previously, we demonstrated that global Notch1 deficiency prevents the formation of AAA in a mouse model. Herein, we sought to explore the cell-specific roles of Notch1 in AAA development.Cell-specific Notch1 haploinsufficient mice, generated on Apoe-/- background using Cre-lox technology, were infused with angiotensin II (1000 ng/min/kg) for 28 days. Notch1 haploinsufficiency in myeloid cells (n = 9) prevented the formation of AAA attributed to decreased inflammation. Haploinsufficiency of Notch1 in SMCs (n = 14) per se did not prevent AAA formation, but histoarchitectural traits of AAA including elastin degradation and aortic remodeling, were minimal in SMC-Notch1+/-;Apoe-/- mice compared to Apoe-/- mice (n = 33). Increased immunostaining of the contractile SMC-phenotype markers and concomitant decreased expression of synthetic SMC-phenotype markers were observed in the aortae of SMC-Notch1+/-;Apoe-/- mice. Expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a matrix-associated protein that modulates the synthetic VSMC phenotype, increased in the abdominal aorta of Apoe-/- mice and in the adventitial region of the abdominal aorta in human AAA. Notch1 haploinsufficiency decreased the expression of Ctgf in the aorta and in vitro cell culture system. In vitro studies on SMCs using the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD) plasmid, dominant negative mastermind-like (dnMAML), or specific siRNA suggest that Notch1, not Notch3, directly modulates the expression of CTGF.Our data suggest that lack of Notch1 in SMCs limits dilation of the abdominal aorta by maintaining contractile SMC-phenotype and preventing matrix-remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2617236599,"The four-transmembrane protein MAL2 and tumor protein D52 (TPD52) have been shown to be involved in tumorigenesis of various cancers. However, their roles in colorectal cancer (CRC) remain unclear. In this study, we explored the expressions of MAL2 and TPD52 in tumor specimens resected from 123 CRC patients and the prognostic values of the two proteins in CRC. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that MAL2 (P<0.001) and TPD52 (P<0.001) were significantly highly expressed in primary carcinoma tissues compared with adjacent non-cancerous mucosa tissues. And TPD52 exhibited frequent overexpression in liver metastasis tissues relative to primary carcinoma tissues (P = 0.042), while MAL2 in lymphnode and liver metastasis tissues showed no significant elevation. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) showed the identical results. Correlation analyses by Pearson's chi-square test demonstrated that MAL2 in tumors was positively correlated with tumor status (pathological assessment of regional lymph nodes (pN, P = 0.024)), and clinic stage (P = 0.017). Additionally, the expression of TPD52 was detected under the same condition and was shown to be positively correlated withtumor status (pathological assessment of the primary tumor (pT, P = 0.035), distant metastasis (pM, P = 0.001)) and CRC clinicopathology(P = 0.024). Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated that positive MAL2 (P<0.001) and TPD52 (P<0.001) expressions were associated with poor overall survival (OS) in CRC patients. Multivariate analysis showed that MAL2 and TPD52 expression was an independent prognostic factor for reduced OS of CRC patients. Moreover, overexpression of TPD52 in CRC SW480 cells showed an increased cell migration (P = 0.023) and invasion (P = 0.012) through inducing occurrence of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and activating focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-mediated integrin signalling and PI3K⁄Akt signalling.Whereas TPD52-depleted cells showed the reverse effect. These data suggested that MAL2 and TPD52 might be potential biomarkers for clinical prognosis and might be a promising therapeutic target for CRC."

https://openalex.org/W2617719310,"Weibel–Palade bodies (WPB) are secretory organelles of endothelial cells that undergo evoked exocytosis following intracellular Ca2+ or cAMP elevation, thereby supplying the vasculature with factors controlling hemostasis. Several cytosolic and membrane-associated proteins, including the Rab family members Rab3, Rab15, and Rab27a, have been implicated in regulating the acute exocytosis of WPB. Here, we carried out a genome-wide screen to identify Rab pathways affecting WPB exocytosis. Overexpression of a specific subset of Rab GTPase–activating proteins (RabGAPs) inhibited histamine-evoked, Ca2+-dependent WPB exocytosis, presumably by inactivating the target Rab GTPases. Among these RabGAPs, we concentrated on TBC1D10A and showed that the inhibitory effect depends on its GAP activity. We confirmed that Rab35 was a target Rab of TBC1D10A in human endothelial cells; Rab35 interacted with TBC1D10A, and expression of the GAP-insensitive Rab35(Q67A) mutant rescued the inhibitory effect of TBC1D10A overexpression on WPB exocytosis. Furthermore, knockdown of Rab35 and expression of a dominant-negative Rab35 mutant both inhibited histamine-evoked secretion of the WPB cargos von Willebrand factor and P-selectin. Pulldown and co-immunoprecipitation experiments identified the ArfGAP with coiled-coil, Ank repeat, and pleckstrin homology domain–containing protein ACAP2 as an Rab35 effector in endothelial cells, and depletion as well as overexpression approaches revealed that ACAP2 acts as a negative regulator of WPB exocytosis. Interestingly, a known ACAP2 target, the small GTPase Arf6, supported histamine-evoked WPB exocytosis, as shown by knockdown and overexpression of a dominant-negative Arf6 mutant. Our data identify Rab35 as a novel regulator of WPB exocytosis, most likely acting through the downstream effectors ACAP2 and Arf6.

https://openalex.org/W2618324532,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leads to endothelial dysfunction which is commonly associated in the pathogenesis of several cardiovascular diseases. We explored the vascular protective effects of chronic treatment with paeonol (2'-hydroxy-4'-methoxyacetophenone), the major compound from the root bark of Paeonia suffruticosa on ER stress-induced endothelial dysfunction in mice. Male C57BL/6J mice were injected intraperitoneally with ER stress inducer, tunicamycin (1 mg/kg/week) for 2 weeks to induce ER stress. The animals were co-administered with or without paeonol (20 mg/kg/oral gavage), reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, tempol (20 mg/kg/day) or ER stress inhibitor, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA, 150 mg/kg/day) respectively. Blood pressure and body weight were monitored weekly and at the end of treatment, the aorta was isolated for isometric force measurement. Protein associated with ER stress (GRP78, ATF6 and p-eIF2α) and oxidative stress (NOX2 and nitrotyrosine) were evaluated using Western blotting. Nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability were determined using total nitrate/nitrite assay and western blotting (phosphorylation of eNOS protein). ROS production was assessed by en face dihydroethidium staining and lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence assay, respectively. Our results revealed that mice treated with tunicamycin showed an increased blood pressure, reduction in body weight and impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxations (EDRs) of aorta, which were ameliorated by co-treatment with either paeonol, TUDCA and tempol. Furthermore, paeonol reduced the ROS level in the mouse aorta and improved NO bioavailability in tunicamycin treated mice. These beneficial effects of paeonol observed were comparable to those produced by TUDCA and tempol, suggesting that the actions of paeonol may involve inhibition of ER stress-mediated oxidative stress pathway. Taken together, the present results suggest that chronic treatment with paeonol preserved endothelial function and normalized blood pressure in mice induced by tunicamycin in vivo through the inhibition of ER stress-associated ROS."
https://openalex.org/W2620016352,"Reproductive traits are economically important for beef cattle production; however, these traits are still a bottleneck in indicine cattle since these animals typically reach puberty at older ages when compared to taurine breeds. In addition, reproductive traits are complex phenotypes, i.e., they are controlled by both the environment and many small-effect genes involved in different pathways. In this study, we conducted genome-wide association study (GWAS) and functional analyses to identify important genes and pathways associated with heifer rebreeding (HR) and with the number of calvings at 53 months of age (NC53) in Nellore cows. A total of 142,878 and 244,311 phenotypes for HR and NC53, respectively, and 2,925 animals genotyped with the Illumina Bovine HD panel (Illumina®, San Diego, CA, USA) were used in GWAS applying the weighted single-step GBLUP (WssGBLUP) method. Several genes associated with reproductive events were detected in the 20 most important 1Mb windows for both traits. Significant pathways for HR and NC53 were associated with lipid metabolism and immune processes, respectively. MHC class II genes, detected on chromosome 23 (window 25-26Mb) for NC53, were significantly associated with pregnancy success of Nellore cows. These genes have been proved previously to be associated with reproductive traits such as mate choice in other breeds and species. Our results suggest that genes associated with the reproductive traits HR and NC53 may be involved in embryo development in mammalian species. Furthermore, some genes associated with mate choice may affect pregnancy success in Nellore cattle."

However, few JAK2 inhibitors were being tested for melanoma therapy. In this study, eight amentoflavone analogues were evaluated for their activity against human malignant melanoma cells. The most potent analogue, compound 1, inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 in human melanoma cells, but had no discernible effect on total JAK2 and STAT3 levels. A cellular thermal shift assay was performed to identify that JAK2 is engaged by 1 in cell lysates. Moreover, compound 1 showed higher antiproliferative activity against human melanoma A375 cells compared to a panel of cancer and normal cell lines. Compound 1 also activated caspase-3 and cleaved PARP, which are markers of apoptosis, and suppressed the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 level. Finally, compound 1 induced apoptosis in 80% of treated melanoma cells. To our knowledge, compound 1 is the first amentoflavone-based JAK2 inhibitor to be investigated for use as an anti-melanoma agent."
https://openalex.org/W2621102729,"Tracking animal movements such as walking is an essential task for understanding how and why animals move in an environment and respond to external stimuli. Different methods that implemented image analysis and a data logger such as GPS have been used in laboratory experiments and in field studies, respectively. Recently, animal movement patterns without stimuli have attracted an increasing attention in search for common innate characteristics underlying all of their movements. However, it is difficult to track the movements in a vast and homogeneous environment without stimuli because of space constraints in laboratories or environmental heterogeneity in the field, hindering our understanding of inherent movement patterns. Here, we applied an omnidirectional treadmill mechanism, or a servosphere, as a tool for tracking two-dimensional movements of small animals that can provide both a homogenous environment and a virtual infinite space for walking. To validate the use of our tracking system for assessment of the free-walking behavior, we compared walking patterns of individual pillbugs (Armadillidium vulgare) on the servosphere with that in two types of experimental flat arenas. Our results revealed that the walking patterns on the servosphere showed similar diffusive characteristics to those observed in the large arena simulating an open space, and we demonstrated that our mechanism provides more robust measurements of diffusive properties compared to a small arena with enclosure. Moreover, we showed that anomalous diffusion properties, including Lévy walk, can be detected from the free-walking behavior on our tracking system. Thus, our novel tracking system is useful to measure inherent movement patterns, which will contribute to the studies of movement ecology, ethology, and behavioral sciences."
https://openalex.org/W2617978786,"Mobile phones (MPs) have been an essential part of the lives of healthcare professionals and have improved communication, collaboration, and sharing of information. Nonetheless, the widespread use of MPs in hospitals has raised concerns of nosocomial infections, especially in areas requiring the highest hygienic standards such as operating rooms (ORs). This study evaluated the incidence of bacterial contamination of the MPs carried by medical staff working in the OR and determined its association with bacterial colonization of this personnel.This is an observational cohort study. Medical staffs working in the OR were asked to take bacterial cultures from their MPs, anterior nares, and dominant hands. To identify the relation between MP contamination and bacterial colonization of the medical staff, genotyping of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) was done via Staphylococcus protein A gene (spa) typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).A total of 216 swab samples taken from 72 medical-staff members were analyzed. The culture-positive rate was 98.1% (212/216). In 59 (27.3%) samples, the bacteria were possible clinical pathogens. The anterior nares were the most common site of colonization by clinical pathogens (58.3%, 42/72), followed by MPs (13.9%, 10/72) and the dominant hand (9.7%, 7/72). SA was the most commonly isolated clinical pathogen and was found in 43 (19.9%) samples. In 66 (94.3%) of the 70 staff members for whom bacteria were detected on their MPs, the same bacteria were detected in nares or hand. Among 31 medical staff who were carriers of SA in the anterior nares or dominant hand, 8 (25.8%) were found to have SA on their MPs, and genotyping confirmed the same SA strain in 7 (87.5%) of them.A high rate of bacterial nasal colonization and MPs contamination were found among the OR medical staff. An MP may be a reservoir for pathogen contamination in the OR."
https://openalex.org/W2619558061,"Cervical cancer screening usually requires use of a speculum to provide a clear view of the cervix. The speculum is one potential barrier to screening due to fear of pain, discomfort and embarrassment. The aim of this paper is to present and demonstrate the feasibility of a tampon-sized inserter and the POCkeT Colposcope, a miniature pen sized-colposcope, for comfortable, speculum-free and potentially self-colposcopy.We explored different designs using 3D computer-aided design (CAD) software and performed mechanical testing simulations on each. Designs were rapid prototyped and tested using a custom vaginal phantom across a range of vaginal pressures and uterine tilts to select an optimal design. Two final designs were tested with fifteen volunteers to assess cervix visualization, comfort and usability compared to the speculum and the optimal design, the curved-tip inserter, was selected for testing in volunteers.We present a vaginal inserter as an alternative to the standard speculum for use with the POCkeT Colposcope. The device has a slim tubular body with a funnel-like curved tip measuring approximately 2.5 cm in diameter. The inserter has a channel through which a 2 megapixel (MP) mini camera with LED illumination fits to enable image capture. Mechanical finite element testing simulations with an applied pressure of 15 cm H2O indicated a high factor of safety (90.9) for the inserter. Testing of the device with a custom vaginal phantom, across a range of supine vaginal pressures and uterine tilts (retroverted, anteverted and sideverted), demonstrated image capture with a visual area comparable to the speculum for a normal/axial positioned uteri and significantly better than the speculum for anteverted and sideverted uteri (p<0.00001). Volunteer studies with self-insertion and physician-assisted cervix image capture showed adequate cervix visualization for 83% of patients. In addition, questionnaire responses from volunteers indicated a 92.3% overall preference for the inserter over the speculum and all indicated that the inserter was more comfortable than the speculum. The inserter provides a platform for self-cervical cancer screening and also enables acetic acid/Lugol's iodine application and insertion of swabs for Pap smear sample collection.This study demonstrates the feasibility of an inserter and miniature-imaging device for comfortable cervical image capture of women with potential for synergistic HPV and Pap smear sample collection."
https://openalex.org/W2616871144,"Optical “virtual biopsy” is an attractive way to improve disease diagnosis and surgical guidance. Many optical microscopy techniques have been developed to provide diagnostic information without the need for tissue sectioning or staining. Among these techniques, label-free chemical imaging is the most desirable. Recently, it has been shown that narrowband, picosecond stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) can achieve comparable morphological contrast to hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E staining), the ‘gold standard’ of pathology. However, to translate the technique from the bench to the bedside, optimal laser sources and parameters have yet to be identified. Here we describe an improvement to the narrowband SRS microscopy techniques for label-free tissue imaging. Through spectral slicing of broadband, femtosecond pulses, we are able to maintain the same protein/lipid contrast as narrowband SRS while achieving a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Our method draws upon the benefits of femtosecond pulses (e.g. higher peak power) while preserving those of picosecond pulses (e.g. adequate spectral resolution). We demonstrate this achievement through protein/lipid signal and contrast quantification of mouse brain tissue as a function of bandwidth, and comparison with numerical simulations. Further method validation is provided through imaging of additional mouse tissues: liver, kidney, and skin."
https://openalex.org/W2621223303,"The Hippo signaling pathway, which is implicated in the regulation of organ size, has emerged as a potential target for the development of cancer therapeutics. YAP, TAZ (transcription co-activators) and TEAD (transcription factor) are the downstream transcriptional machinery and effectors of the pathway. Formation of the YAP/TAZ-TEAD complex leads to transcription of growth-promoting genes. Conversely, disrupting the interactions of the complex decreases cell proliferation. Herein, we screened a 1000-member fragment library using Thermal Shift Assay and identified a hit fragment. We confirmed its binding at the YAP/TAZ-TEAD interface by X-ray crystallography, and showed that it occupies the same hydrophobic pocket as a conserved phenylalanine of YAP/TAZ. This hit fragment serves as a scaffold for the development of compounds that have the potential to disrupt YAP/TAZ-TEAD interactions. Structure-activity relationship studies and computational modeling were also carried out to identify more potent compounds that may bind at this validated druggable binding site."
https://openalex.org/W2619197807,"Many biopharmaceuticals (BPs) are known to be immunogenic in the clinic, which can result in modified pharmacokinetics, reduced efficacy, allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. During recent years, several technologies to predict immunogenicity have been introduced, but the predictive value is still considered low. Thus, there is an unmet medical need for optimization of such technologies. The generation of T cell dependent high affinity anti-drug antibodies plays a key role in clinical immunogenicity. This study aimed at developing and evaluating a novel in vitro T cell:PBMC assay for prediction of the immunogenicity potential of BPs. To this end, we assessed the ability of infliximab (anti-TNF-α), rituximab (anti-CD20), adalimumab (anti-TNF-α) and natalizumab (anti-α4-integrin), all showing immunogenicity in the clinic, to induce a CD4+ T cells response. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) and cytomegalovirus pp65 protein (CMV) were included as neo-antigen and recall antigen positive controls, respectively. By analyzing 26 healthy donors having HLA-DRB1 alleles matching the European population, we calculated the frequency of responding donors, the magnitude of the response, and the frequency of BP-specific T cells, as measured by 3[H]-thymidine incorporation and ELISpot IL-2 secretion. KLH and CMV demonstrated a strong T cell response in all the donors analyzed. The frequency of responding donors to the BPs was 4% for infliximab, 8% for adalimumab, 19% for rituximab and 27% for natalizumab, which is compared to and discussed with their respective observed clinical immunogenicity. This study further complements predictive immunogenicity testing by quantifying the in vitro CD4+ T cell responses to different BPs. Even though the data generated using this modified method does not directly translate to the clinical situation, a high sensitivity and immunogenic potential of most BPs is demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W2616977573,"The N2pc is a lateralised Event-Related Potential (ERP) that signals a shift of attention towards the location of a potential object of interest. We propose a single-trial target-localisation collaborative Brain-Computer Interface (cBCI) that exploits this ERP to automatically approximate the horizontal position of targets in aerial images. Images were presented by means of the rapid serial visual presentation technique at rates of 5, 6 and 10 Hz. We created three different cBCIs and tested a participant selection method in which groups are formed according to the similarity of participants’ performance. The N2pc that is elicited in our experiments contains information about the position of the target along the horizontal axis. Moreover, combining information from multiple participants provides absolute median improvements in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of up to 21% (for groups of size 3) with respect to single-user BCIs. These improvements are bigger when groups are formed by participants with similar individual performance, and much of this effect can be explained using simple theoretical models. Our results suggest that BCIs for automated triaging can be improved by integrating two classification systems: one devoted to target detection and another to detect the attentional shifts associated with lateral targets."

https://openalex.org/W2619589288,"Genetic studies have identified many risk loci for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) although causal factors in the majority of cases are still unknown. Currently, known ASD risk genes are all protein-coding genes; however, the vast majority of transcripts in humans are non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) which do not encode proteins. Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were shown to be highly expressed in the human brain and crucial for normal brain development. We have constructed a computational pipeline for the integration of various genomic datasets to identify lncRNAs associated with ASD. This pipeline utilizes differential gene expression patterns in affected tissues in conjunction with gene co-expression networks in tissue-matched non-affected samples. We analyzed RNA-seq data from the cortical brain tissues from ASD cases and controls to identify lncRNAs differentially expressed in ASD. We derived a gene co-expression network from an independent human brain developmental transcriptome and detected a convergence of the differentially expressed lncRNAs and known ASD risk genes into specific co-expression modules. Co-expression network analysis facilitates the discovery of associations between previously uncharacterized lncRNAs with known ASD risk genes, affected molecular pathways and at-risk developmental time points. In addition, we show that some of these lncRNAs have a high degree of overlap with major CNVs detected in ASD genetic studies. By utilizing this integrative approach comprised of differential expression analysis in affected tissues and connectivity metrics from a developmental co-expression network, we have prioritized a set of candidate ASD-associated lncRNAs. The identification of lncRNAs as novel ASD susceptibility genes could help explain the genetic pathogenesis of ASD."
https://openalex.org/W2620304458,"Post-aggression consolation is assumed to occur in humans as well as in chimpanzees. While consolation following peer aggression has been observed in children, systematic evidence of consolation in human adults is rare. We used surveillance camera footage of the immediate aftermath of nonfatal robberies to observe the behaviors and characteristics of victims and bystanders. Consistent with empathy explanations, we found that consolation was linked to social closeness rather than physical closeness. While females were more likely to console than males, males and females were equally likely to be consoled. Furthermore, we show that high levels of threat during the robbery increased the likelihood of receiving consolation afterwards. These patterns resemble post-aggression consolation in chimpanzees and suggest that emotions of empathic concern are involved in consolation across humans and chimpanzees."
https://openalex.org/W2618330737,"Gap junctions (GJs) are important for maintenance of CNS homeostasis. GJ proteins, connexin 43 (Cx43) and connexin 47 (Cx47), play a crucial role in production and maintenance of CNS myelin. Cx43 is mainly expressed by astrocytes in the CNS and forms gap junction intercellular communications between astrocytes-astrocytes (Cx43–Cx43) and between astrocytes-oligodendrocytes (Cx43–Cx47). Mutations of these connexin (Cx) proteins cause dysmyelinating diseases in humans. Previously, it has been shown that Cx43 localization and expression is altered due to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59 infection both in vivo and in vitro; however, its mechanism and association with loss of myelin protein was not elaborated. Thus, we explored potential mechanisms by which MHV-A59 infection alters Cx43 localization and examined the effects of viral infection on Cx47 expression and its association with loss of the myelin marker proteolipid protein. Immunofluorescence and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy confirmed that MHV-A59 used microtubules (MTs) as a conduit to reach the cell surface and restricted MT-mediated Cx43 delivery to the cell membrane. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that Cx43–β-tubulin molecular interaction was depleted due to protein–protein interaction between viral particles and MTs. During acute MHV-A59 infection, oligodendrocytic Cx47, which is mainly stabilized by Cx43 in vivo, was down-regulated, and its characteristic staining remained disrupted even at chronic phase.

Highly dynamic structures of MTs spontaneously undergo phases of polymerization and catastrophe and play major roles in various cellular processes. These processes include intracellular transportation of organelles and molecules. The movement and delivery of proteins, vesicular carriers, and organelles from their site of production to specific destinations are crucial for their function. Hence, the trafficking of different membrane proteins like cell junction proteins and signaling molecules to the cell membrane plays an essential role in cellular functioning. A group of cell junction proteins, gap junctions (GJs), form intercellular channels between two neighboring cells only after successful delivery and docking to the cell membrane. GJs are made up of connexin (Cx) proteins, which are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), oligomerized in intercellular organelles like ER or the trans-Golgi network, and finally delivered to the cell surface (1.Das Sarma J. Wang F. Koval M. Targeted gap junction protein constructs reveal connexin-specific differences in oligomerization.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20911-20918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and a pair of hemichannels from a GJ plaque. One of the most studied Cxs, Cx43, is expressed in multiple organs, including the CNS, heart, and lungs. In the CNS, Cx43 is mainly expressed by astrocytes (2.Iacobas D.A. Urban-Maldonado M.

Cx43 forms homotypic Cx43–Cx43–mediated channels with other astrocytes and heterotypic Cx43–Cx47–mediated channels with oligodendrocytes (3.Lutz S.E. Zhao Y. Gulinello M. Lee S.C. Raine C.S.

These channels are important for maintaining CNS nutrient homeostasis, ionic buffering, and small-molecule (<1 kDa) exchange (4.Sofroniew M.V. Vinters H.V.

Delivery of Cx43 specifically relies on the MT network. Cx43 molecules are delivered in vesicular carriers that traffic along MTs from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (13.Lauf U. Giepmans B.N. Lopez P. Braconnot S. Chen S.C. Falk M.M. Dynamic trafficking and delivery of connexons to the plasma membrane and accretion to gap junctions in living cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 10446-10451Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The delivery of Cx43-containing vesicles involves intermediate proteins like EB1, p150 (Glued) of dynein–dynactin complexes, and β-catenin (14.Shaw R.M. Fay A.J. Puthenveedu M.A. von Zastrow M.

Our recent study showed that a neurotropic demyelinating strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-A59 causes retention of Cx43 in the endoplasmic reticulum and/or endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate complex (ER and/or ERGIC). The expression of Cx43 is also reduced in protein and RNA level in cultured astrocytes. These phenomena affect functional channel formation between primary astrocytes. Similar alterations of Cx43 expression and localization are also observed in the mouse brain (19.Basu R. Banerjee K. Bose A. Das Sarma J. Mouse hepatitis virus infection remodels connexin43-mediated gap junction intercellular communication in vitro and in vivo.J. Virol. 2015; 90: 2586-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but the molecular mechanism of Cx43 retention in the ER–ERGIC was not described. For efficient infection and cell-to-cell spread, many viruses have developed mechanisms for utilizing cytoskeletal elements. The JHM strain of MHV uses MTs for transneuronal spread within the CNS, and the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein is predicted to have MT interactive properties (20.Pasick J.M. Kalicharran K. Dales S. Distribution and trafficking of JHM coronavirus structural proteins and virions in primary neurons and the OBL-21 neuronal cell line.J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2915-2928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study shows a demyelinating recombinant strain of MHV, RSA59, uses the MT network as a conduit for cell-to-cell spread (21.Biswas K. Das Sarma J. Effect of microtubule disruption on neuronal spread and replication of demyelinating and nondemyelinating strains of mouse hepatitis virus in vitro.J. Virol. 2014; 88: 3043-3047Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Other viruses like Herpes simplex virus 1 utilize the cellular MT network for trafficking of virions and viral glycoproteins to virus release sites (22.Mingo R.M. Han J. Newcomb W.W. Brown J.C. Replication of herpes simplex virus: egress of progeny virus at specialized cell membrane sites.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 7084-7097Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Vaccinia virus is reported to use both MT networks and actin filament for egression (23.Hollinshead M. Rodger G. Van Eijl H. Law M. Hollinshead R. Vaux D.J. Smith G.L. Vaccinia virus utilizes microtubules for movement to the cell surface.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Adenovirus entry to host cells is dependent on MTs (24.Yea C. Dembowy J. Pacione L. Brown M. Microtubule-mediated and microtubule-independent transport of adenovirus type 5 in HEK293 cells.J. Virol. 2007; 81: 6899-6908Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and the virus also uses MT-associated molecular motors for retrograde transport (25.Kelkar S.A. Pfister K.K. Crystal R.G. Leopold P.L. Cytoplasmic dynein mediates adenovirus binding to microtubules.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 10122-10132Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The adeno-associated virus also displays unidirectional movement on MTs toward the nuclei (26.Xiao P.J. Samulski R.J. Cytoplasmic trafficking, endosomal escape, and perinuclear accumulation of adeno-associated virus type 2 particles are facilitated by microtubule network.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 10462-10473Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In contrast, there are few studies available delineating which specific molecules, if any, exhibit altered intracellular localization due to MT-mediated viral trafficking. Thus, our current study is designed to understand whether specific utilization of the MT network for virus trafficking by MHV-A59 may be an underlying mechanism by which Cx43 is restricted from localizing to the cell surface. MHV-A59 causes hepatitis and meningoencephalitis in the acute phase of infection and leads to demyelination and concurrent axonal loss during the chronic phase, serving as a virus-induced chronic progressive model of the human CNS demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis (27.Das Sarma J. A mechanism of virus-induced demyelination.Interdiscip. Perspect. Infect. Dis. 2010; 2010: 109239Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28.Lavi E. Gilden D.H. Wroblewska Z. Rorke L.B. Weiss S.R. Experimental demyelination produced by the A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus.Neurology. 1984; 34: 597-603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cx43-mediated GJICs play a critical role in formation and maintenance of normal myelin. Recent studies indicate that GJIC formation between astrocytic Cx43 and oligodendrocytic Cx47 is crucial for human myelination (29.Bugiani M. Al Shahwan S. Lamantea E. Bizzi A. Bakhsh E. Moroni I. Balestrini M.R. Uziel G. Zeviani M.

Genet. 2004; 75: 251-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). These GJICs are important in K+ buffering and nutrient homeostasis (31.Orthmann-Murphy J.L. Abrams C.K. Scherer S.S. Gap junctions couple astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.J. Mol. Neurosci. 2008; 35: 101-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Upon docking, Cx47 GJ hemichannels are phosphorylated and stabilized as GJ plaques by Cx43 (32.May D. Tress O. Seifert G. Willecke K. Connexin47 protein phosphorylation and stability in oligodendrocytes depend on expression of Connexin43 protein in astrocytes.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 7985-7996Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Hence, alteration of Cx43 expression and trafficking is hypothesized to have a critical impact on Cx47 expression in this viral model of neuroinflammation. Altered Cx43–Cx47–mediated heterotypic GJIC formation between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes could be associated with loss of myelin protein. In this context, we extended our study to examine alterations of Cx47 during MHV-A59 infection and its association with myelin marker proteolipid protein (PLP). In summary, the current study was focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms of virus-induced alteration of Cx43. This study was also extended to understand whether the alteration of Cx43 was also associated with altered oligodendrocytic GJ and myelin protein expression. The prior studies in this field showed that the MT network is important for trafficking of Cx43 as well as viral particles. In this context, we observed that Cx43 and β-tubulin colocalization was reduced due to viral infection. Consistently, viral particles colocalized with the MT network. Upon MHV-A59 infection, the delivery of Cx43 to the cell surface, along MT threads, was reduced. At the molecular level, Cx43–β-tubulin protein–protein interaction was reduced, and it was confirmed that MHV-A59 interacted with MTs. In addition, Cx47 was depleted in MHV-A59–infected mouse brain, and this GJ alteration was associated with loss of myelin protein PLP. Primary astrocytes were treated with 100 μm colchicine for 24 h as a representative dose to disrupt the MT network without affecting cell viability. The cell viability of primary astrocytes, upon colchicine treatment, is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. Control cells were maintained in parallel. Cells were coimmunostained with rabbit anti-Cx43 antiserum (red) and mouse anti-β-tubulin antiserum (green). Z-stacking was obtained by a confocal microscope, with signals obtained from the base of the cells (Fig. 1, Plane 1) to the medial part of the cells (Fig. 1, Plane 4), to observe the distribution of Cx43 upon MT disruption. Untreated cells showed the presence of Cx43 at the basal stack (Fig. 1A, thin arrow) and peripheral part of the medial stacks of cells (Fig. 1, B–D). In contrast, at the basal stack of colchicine-treated cells (Fig. 1E, thick arrow), the presence of Cx43 was diminished, whereas the medial stacks showed the continued presence of Cx43 mostly inside the cells (Fig. 1, F–H, thick arrow), suggesting that Cx43 delivery to cell surface was restricted upon MT disruption. This was confirmed by disrupted β-tubulin staining (Fig. 1, F–H). Digitally magnified insets (Fig. 1, I and J) show that Cx43 was present on MT threads with an appearance of “beads-on-a-string” in a single focal plane. Colocalization was evident, specifically where the intensity of Cx43 and β-tubulin was similar (Fig. 1I, ringlike yellow spots, thin arrow). Colchicine-treated cells showed smearlike disruption of β-tubulin signal, whereas Cx43 surface localization and colocalization with MT were restricted (Fig. 1J, thick arrow). For better understanding of Cx43 and tubulin localization, individual channel images of each plane of untreated and colchicine-treated cells are shown in supplemental Fig. S2. Cx43 molecules are reported to directly bind to MTs (15.Giepmans B.N. Verlaan I. Hengeveld T. Janssen H. Calafat J. Falk M.M. Moolenaar W.H. Gap junction protein connexin-43 interacts directly with microtubules.Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1364-1368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and the MT network helps direct delivery of Cx43 hemichannels to the cell surface (14.Shaw R.M. Fay A.J. Puthenveedu M.A. von Zastrow M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Primary astrocytes were infected with MHV-A59, and mock-infected cells were maintained in parallel. After 24 h postinfection (p.i.), cells were cytofixed and subjected to double-label immunofluorescence with monoclonal anti-β-tubulin (green in Fig. 2, A, E, and I) and polyclonal anti-Cx43 (red in Fig. 2, B, F, and J) antibodies. Cells were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Both mock- and virus-infected cells showed normal MT morphology (Fig. 2, A and E), whereas 100 μm colchicine treatment disrupted the MT network (Fig. 2I). Characteristic punctate staining of Cx43 was observed for mock-infected cells (Fig. 2B). Virus-infected (Fig. 2F) and colchicine-treated cells (Fig. 2J) showed intracellular localization of Cx43. Consistent with prior studies, primary astrocytes showed a proximal association between Cx43 and the MT network (Fig. 2C, thin arrow). When the astrocytes were infected with MHV-A59, Cx43 was localized in a perinuclear compartment, with minimal association with the MT network (Fig. 2G, thick arrow). Colchicine-treated cells showed a disrupted MT network, and Cx43 staining was mainly redistributed in the cytosol (Fig. 2K, thick arrow). The number of points containing colocalization of immunostaining and the intensity of staining was maximal for mock-infected cells (Fig. 2D). Upon virus infection (Fig. 2H) or microtubule disruption with colchicine (Fig. 2L), colocalization was reduced. There was ∼62.8% reduction in colocalized staining within virus-infected cells compared with mock-infected cells (**, p < 0.01; Mann–Whitney U test) and ∼80.3% reduction in colchicine-treated cells compared with mock-infected cells (**, p < 0.01; Mann–Whitney U test). Kruskal–Wallis analysis showed that the differences in a three-way comparison of groups were statistically significant (****, p < 0.0001). Five different images from n = 3 biological replicates were quantified for each experimental group (Fig. 2M). A staining intensity profile was drawn in digitally magnified images, which showed that Cx43 molecules were present along a MT thread (Fig. 2, N and O), whereas Cx43 retained in the intracellular compartment in MHV-A59–infected cells did not show such alignment (Fig. 2, P and Q). Cx43 molecules showed high-intensity peaks on MT threads in mock-infected cells (Fig. 2, R and S), but not in virus-infected cells (Fig. 2, T and U). When mock-infected and virus-infected cells were similarly stained with monoclonal anti-viral N (green in Fig. 3, A and D) and polyclonal anti-β-tubulin (red in Fig. 3, B and E) antibodies, similar tubulin morphology was observed for both. Maximum intensity projection images, obtained from an apotome microscope, showed dispersion of viral staining from the perinuclear compartment to the cell periphery. Viral N signal colocalized with β-tubulin staining, specifically noticeable at the cell surface (Fig. 3F, arrow). As expected, no viral antigen was present in the mock-infected cells (Fig. 3C). To examine whether viral particles were spreading along the MT network, primary astrocytes were mock-infected (Fig. 4, A and B) or MHV-A59–infected, and at 6 h (Fig. 4, C and D), 12 h (Fig. 4, E and F), 18 h (Fig. 4, G and H), and 24 h (Fig. 4, I and J) p.i., cells were labeled for β-tubulin (red) and viral N (green). The amount of viral N staining increased from 6 to 24 h p.i. At 6 and 12 h p.i., discrete viral particles were observed to be present on the MT threads (Fig. 4, C and E, arrow and inset), and colocalization points were mainly located at the cell periphery (Fig. 4, D and F). Later, at 18 and 24 h p.i., the anti-N signal was more dispersed throughout the whole cell, and toward the cell border, viral particles were localized on MTs (Fig. 4, G and I, arrow and inset). The number of colocalization points increased visually and were mainly located at the cell periphery and cell-to-cell junctions (Fig. 4, H and J). The number of spots containing colocalization of staining were counted and plotted against increasing time p.i., which showed that the number of colocalization spots increased from 6 h p.i. to 12–18 h p.i. and reached its maximum at 24 h p.i. (**, p < 0.01 for 6, 12, 18, and 24 h p.i. and 24 h p.i. each compared with mock by Mann–Whitney U test). ANOVA was performed by Kruskal–Wallis testing and confirmed that the variations between groups were significant (***, p < 0.001). Five different fields were obtained from each experimental group in n = 3 experiments (Fig. 4K). To understand the Cx43 and β-tubulin interaction at the cell membrane, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy was performed, which specifically magnifies staining of molecules present at or in close proximity (100 nm) to the cell surface. Cells plated on glass coverslips were mock- or virus-infected and subjected to double-label immunofluorescence for Cx43 (green in Fig. 5, A and F) and β-tubulin (red in Fig. 5, B and G), and nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Cx43 was subjected to TIRF microscopy, keeping the imaging depth restricted to 100 nm. The whole-cell MT network was captured by epifluorescence microscopy. In mock-infected astrocytes, TIRF images showed the signal of Cx43 exclusively present at or near the cell surface (Fig. 5, A and C). In contrast, MHV-A59–infected cells showed minimal surface expression of Cx43 (Fig. 5, F and H). MT morphology appeared normal in mock-infected and MHV-A59–infected cells (Fig. 5, panels B and C and panels G and H). In mock-infected cells, merged TIRF images showed that Cx43 molecules were closely associated with tubulin threads (Fig. 5C, thin arrow) and indeed aligned along the MT threads (Fig. 5D, inset, thin arrow) or positioned at the tip of the MT threads (Fig. 5E, inset, thin arrow). MHV-A59–infected astrocytes showed an absence of MT-associated Cx43 signal near the cell surface (Fig. 5H). Insets showed that Cx43 molecules were restricted from reaching the cell surface (no TIRF signal was detected; Fig. 5I, thick arrow), and Cx43–β-tubulin association was lost (Fig. 5J, thick arrow). The loss of Cx43–β-tubulin colocalization was predicted to be due to association between viral particles and the MT network. Hence, cells were double-immunolabeled for viral N (green in Fig. 5, K and O) and β-tubulin (red in Fig. 5, L and P), and nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Mock-infected astrocytes showed no specific N-staining (Fig. 5K), whereas MHV-A59–infected cells showed profuse N expression (Fig. 5O, arrow). The MT network appeared normal in both mock- and virus-infected cells (Fig. 5, L and P). High magnification (×100) TIRF images were captured specifically for single infected cells, where viral spread at the surface was evident. In contrast to merged images for mock-infected cells (Fig. 5M), viral particles were observed to be colocalized with MT signal (Fig. 5Q). In digitally magnified insets, viral particles were observed to be aligned along the MT thread at the cell surface, confirming that Cx43–MT association could be replaced by MHV-A59–MT association (Fig. 5R). No viral N staining was observed in the inset (Fig. 5N). For Cx43 localization, compared with the MT network, TIRF microscopy was used to capture the signal of Cx43 residing near the cell surface (near 100 nm), and parallel epifluorescence images were captured for the same field. Cx43 was observed to be present in profuse amounts as its characteristic punctate stain (Fig. 6, A (thin arrow) and C (merged)). In contrast, MHV-A59–infected astrocytes showed mainly perinuclear localization of Cx43 (Fig. 6, D (thick arrow) and F (merged)), which was not observed by TIRF imaging. MT morphology is shown for mock-infected (Fig. 6B) or MHV-A59–infected cells (Fig. 6E). The distance of Cx43 molecules from the nuclear centroid was measured with the help of ImageJ (Fig. 6G). For mock-infected cells, Cx43 was present ∼25.9 μm away, which was reduced to ∼12.7 μm in MHV-A59–infected cells. Data were obtained from nine different images from n = 3 biological replicates, and average ± S.D. is represented in the graph (****, p < 0.0001; t test). To investigate the direct interaction between β-tubulin and Cx43, the same number of primary astrocytes were mock-infected or infected with MHV-A59. Cells were lysed in non-denaturing conditions; mouse monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody was used to immunoprecipitate β-tubulin, with the help of anti-mouse MagnaBind antibody. The sample was further denatured with Laemmli's buffer and was probed by rabbit polyclonal anti-Cx43 antibody (detectable at nearly 43 kDa). Uninfected primary astrocytes showed that Cx43 was co-immunoprecipitated with β-tubulin, and this interaction was significantly reduced upon MHV-A59 infection. Five percent input of the total extract showed there was a reduction of total Cx43 upon virus infection, but the expression of internal control γ-actin (detectable at nearly 42 kDa) was similar. The beads, without any primary antibody, showed no nonspecific interaction in immunoprecipitation (Fig. 7A). Densitometric analysis showed that Cx43, bound to β-tubulin, was reduced ∼44.25% in MHV-A59–infected cells, compared with the mock-infected cells (Fig. 7B; ****, p < 0.0001; t test; n = 3). The reduction in Cx43–β-tubulin interaction was verified with the help of reverse co-IP, where proteins extracted in non-denaturing conditions from both mock- and MHV-A59–infected astrocytes were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-Cx43 antibody and probed with monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody (detected at nearly 50 kDa). As expected, the expression of β-tubulin was similar between mock- and M"

This report is the first to show that Pin1 expression in pancreatic β cells is markedly elevated by high-fat diet feeding and in ob/ob mice. To elucidate the role of Pin1 in pancreatic β cells, we generated β-cell–specific Pin1 KO (βPin1 KO) mice. These mutant mice showed exacerbation of glucose intolerance but had normal insulin sensitivity. We identified two independent factors underlying impaired insulin secretion in the βPin1 KO mice. Pin1 enhanced pancreatic β-cell proliferation, as indicated by a reduced β-cell mass in βPin1 KO mice compared with control mice. Moreover, a diet high in fat and sucrose failed to increase pancreatic β-cell growth in the βPin1 KO mice, an observation to which up-regulation of the cell cycle protein cyclin D appeared to contribute. The other role of Pin1 was to activate the insulin-secretory step: Pin1 KO β cells showed impairments in glucose- and KCl-induced elevation of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and insulin secretion. We also identified salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2) as a Pin1-binding protein that affected the regulation of Ca2+ influx and found Pin1 to enhance SIK2 kinase activity, resulting in a decrease in p35 protein, a negative regulator of Ca2+ influx. Taken together, our observations demonstrate critical roles of Pin1 in pancreatic β cells and that Pin1 both promotes β-cell proliferation and activates insulin secretion."

https://openalex.org/W2621169151,"Genetic rescue, outcrossing with individuals from a related population, is used to augment genetic diversity in populations threatened by severe inbreeding and extinction. The endangered Norwegian Lundehund dog underwent at least two severe bottlenecks in the 1940s and 1960s that each left only five inbred dogs, and the approximately 1500 dogs remaining world-wide today appear to descend from only two individuals. The Lundehund has a high prevalence of a gastrointestinal disease, to which all remaining dogs may be predisposed. Outcrossing is currently performed with three Nordic Spitz breeds: Norwegian Buhund, Icelandic Sheepdog, and Norrbottenspets. Examination of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes based on 165K loci in 48 dogs from the four breeds revealed substantially lower genetic diversity for the Lundehund (HE 0.035) than for other breeds (HE 0.209–0.284). Analyses of genetic structure with > 15K linkage disequilibrium-pruned SNPs showed four distinct genetic clusters. Pairwise FST values between Lundehund and the candidate breeds were highest for Icelandic Sheepdog, followed by Buhund and Norrbottenspets. We assessed the presence of outlier loci among candidate breeds and examined flanking genome regions (1 megabase) for genes under possible selection to identify potential adaptive differences among breeds; outliers were observed in flanking regions of genes associated with key functions including the immune system, metabolism, cognition and physical development. We suggest crossbreeding with multiple breeds as the best strategy to increase genetic diversity for the Lundehund and to reduce the incidence of health problems. For this project, the three candidate breeds were first selected based on phenotypes and then subjected to genetic investigation. Because phenotypes are often paramount for domestic breed owners, such a strategy could provide a helpful approach for genetic rescue and restoration of other domestic populations at risk, by ensuring the involvement of owners, breeders and managers at the start of the project."
https://openalex.org/W2617302565,"Transgenic mice that express channelrhodopsin-2 or its variants provide a powerful tool for optogenetic study of the nervous system. Previous studies have established that introducing such exogenous genes usually does not alter anatomical, electrophysiological, and behavioral properties of neurons in these mice. However, in a line of Thy1-ChR2-YFP transgenic mice (line 9, Jackson lab), we found that short-latency motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation had a longer latency and much lower amplitude than that of wild type mice. MEPs evoked by transcranial electrical stimulation also had a much higher threshold in ChR2 mice, although similar amplitudes could be evoked in both wild and ChR2 mice at maximal stimulation. In contrast, long-latency MEPs evoked by electrically stimulating the motor cortex were similar in amplitude and latency between wild type and ChR2 mice. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings from layer V pyramidal neurons of the motor cortex in ChR2 mice revealed no significant differences in intrinsic membrane properties and action potential firing in response to current injection. These data suggest that corticospinal tract is not accountable for the observed abnormality. Motor behavioral assessments including BMS score, rotarod, and grid-walking test showed no significant differences between the two groups. Because short-latency MEPs are known to involve brainstem reticulospinal tract, while long-latency MEPs mainly involve primary motor cortex and dorsal corticospinal tract, we conclude that this line of ChR2 transgenic mice has normal function of motor cortex and dorsal corticospinal tract, but reduced excitability and responsiveness of reticulospinal tracts. This abnormality needs to be taken into account when using these mice for related optogenetic study."
https://openalex.org/W2620123845,"This is the first study examining functionality of subjects with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears and a subsequent reconstruction comprehensively by multiple test sessions from pre- to six months post-reconstruction. The purpose was to evaluate if a generally applied rehabilitation program restores functionality to levels of healthy controls. Subjects with unilateral tears of the ACL were compared to matched healthy controls throughout the rehabilitation. 20 recreational athletes were tested: T1 (preoperative), 6 weeks after tear; T2, 6 weeks, T3, 3 months, T4, 6 months post-reconstruction. At all test sessions, subjects self-evaluated their activity level with the Tegner activity score and their knee state with the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score. Passive range of motion during knee flexion and extension and leg circumference were measured as functional clinical tests. Bilateral countermovement jumps, one-leg jumps for distance and isometric force tests in knee flexion and extension with 90° and 110° knee angle were conducted as functional performance tests. For determination of functionality, leg symmetry indices (LSIs) were calculated by dividing values of the injured by the uninjured leg. In the ACL group most LSIs decreased from T1 to T2, and increased from T2 and T3 to T4. LSIs of ACL subjects remained lower than LSIs of healthy controls at 6 months post-reconstruction in nearly all parameters. Self-evaluation of ACL subjects showed, additionally, that activity level was lower than the pre-injury level at 6 months post-reconstruction. Low LSIs and low self-evaluation indicate that knee joint functionality is not completely restored at 6 months post-reconstruction. The study shows that multiple comprehensive testing throughout the rehabilitation gives detailed images of the functional state. Therefore, the functional state of ACL reconstructed individuals should be evaluated comprehensively and continuously throughout the rehabilitation to detect persisting deficiencies detailed and adapt rehabilitation programs individually depending on the functionality."
https://openalex.org/W2620866708,"Background Establish accuracy and reproducibility of subjective grading in ultra-widefield fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and determine if an association exists between peripheral FAF abnormalities and AMD. Methods This was a prospective, single-blinded case-control study. Patients were consecutively recruited for the study. Patients were excluded if there was a history of prior or active ocular pathology other than AMD or image quality was insufficient for analysis as determined by two independent graders. Control patients were those without any evidence of AMD or other ophthalmic disease apart from cataract. Using the Optos 200Tx (Optos, Marlborough, MA, USA), a ResMax central macula and an ultra-widefield peripheral retina image was taken for each eye in both normal color and short wavelength FAF. Ultra-widefield photographs were modified to mask the macula. Each ResMax and ultra-widefield image was independently graded by two blinded investigators. Results There were 28 AMD patients and 11 controls. There was a significant difference in the average age between AMD patients and control groups (80 versus 64, respectively P<0.001). There was moderate, statistically significant agreement between observers regarding image interpretation (78.4%, K = 0.524, P<0.001), and 69.0% (K = 0.49, P<0.001) agreement between graders for FAF abnormality patterns. Patients with AMD were at greater risk for peripheral FAF abnormalities (OR: 3.43, P = 0.019) and patients with FAF abnormalities on central macular ResMax images were at greater risk of peripheral FAF findings (OR: 5.19, P = 0.017). Conclusion Subjective interpretation of FAF images has moderate reproducibility and validity in assessment of peripheral FAF abnormalities. Peripheral FAF abnormalities are seen in both AMD and control patients. Those with AMD, poor visual acuity, and macular FAF abnormalities are at greater risk."
https://openalex.org/W2616979442,"This study was aimed to examine the effect of L-arginine (ARG) exposure on the disposition of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in human endothelial cells. Although the role of ADMA as an inhibitor of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is well-recognized, cellular interactions between ARG and ADMA are not well-characterized. EA.hy926 human vascular endothelial cells were exposed to 15N4-ARG, and the concentrations of 15N4-ARG and ADMA in the cell lysate and incubation medium were determined by a liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay. Nitric oxide (NO) production was estimated by utilizing cumulative nitrite concentration via a fluorometric assay. Cells incubated with 15N4-ARG exhibited enhanced nitrite production as well as 15N4-ARG cellular uptake. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in cellular ADMA level and increase in extracellular ADMA level, indicating an efflux of endogenous ADMA from the cell. The time courses of ADMA efflux as well as nitrite accumulation in parallel with 15N4-ARG uptake were characterized. Following preincubation with 15N4-ARG and D7-ADMA, the efflux of cellular 15N4-ARG and D7-ADMA was significantly stimulated by high concentrations of ARG or ADMA in the incubation medium, demonstrating trans-stimulated cellular transport of these two amino acids. D7-ADMA metabolism was inhibited in the presence of added ARG. These results demonstrated that in addition to an interaction at the level of eNOS, ARG and ADMA may mutually influence their cellular availability via transport and metabolic interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2617918872,"Pleiotrophin (PTN) is a secreted cytokine that is expressed in various cancer cell lines and human tumor such as colon cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer and melanoma. It plays significant roles in angiogenesis, metastasis, differentiation and cell growth. The expression of PTN in the adult is limited to the hippocampus in an activity-dependent manner, making it a very attractive target for cancer therapy. RNA interference (RNAi) offers great potential as a new powerful therapeutic strategy based on its highly specific and efficient silencing of a target gene. However, efficient delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) in vivo remains a significant hurdle for its successful therapeutic application. In this study, we first identified, on a cell-based experiment, applying a 1:1 mixture of two PTN specific siRNA engenders a higher silencing efficiency on both mRNA and protein level than using any of them discretely at the same dose. As a consequence, slower melanoma cells growth was also observed for using two specific siRNA combinatorially. To establish a robust way for siRNA delivery in vivo and further investigate how silence of PTN affects tumor growth, we tested three different methods to deliver siRNA in vivo: first non-targeted in-vivo delivery of siRNA via jetPEI; second lung targeted delivery of siRNA via microbubble coated jetPEI; third tumor cell targeted delivery of siRNA via transferrin-polyethylenimine (Tf-PEI). As a result, we found that all three in-vivo siRNAs delivery methods led to an evident inhibition of melanoma growth in non-immune deficiency C57BL/6 mice without a measureable change of ALT and AST activities. Both targeted delivery methods showed more significant curative effect than jetPEI. The lung targeted delivery by microbubble coated jetPEI revealed a comparable therapeutic effect with Tf-PEI, indicating its potential application for target delivery of siRNA in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2617127325,"Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are recommended by the CDC for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) urogenital infections. Current commercial NAATs require technical expertise and sophisticated laboratory infrastructure, are time-consuming and expensive, and do not differentiate the lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) strains that require a longer duration of treatment than non-LGV strains. The multiplexed microfluidic PCR-based assay presented in this work simultaneously interrogates 13 loci to detect Ct and identify LGV and non-LGV strain-types. Based on amplified fragment length polymorphisms, the assay differentiates LGV, ocular, urogenital, and proctocolitis clades, and also serovars L1, L2, and L3 within the LGV group. The assay was evaluated in a blinded fashion using 95 clinical swabs, with 76 previously reported as urogenital Ct-positive samples and typed by ompA genotyping and/or Multi-Locus Sequence Typing. Results of the 13-plex assay showed that 51 samples fell within urogenital clade 2 or 4, 24 samples showed both clade 2 and 4 signatures, indicating possible mixed infection, gene rearrangement, or inter-clade recombination, and one sample was a noninvasive trachoma biovar (either a clade 3 or 4). The remaining 19 blinded samples were correctly identified as LGV clade 1 (3), ocular clade 3 (4), or as negatives (12). To date, no NAAT assay can provide a point-of-care applicable turnaround time for Ct detection while identifying clinically significant Ct strain types to inform appropriate treatment. Coupled with rapid DNA processing of clinical swabs (approximately 60 minutes from swab-in to result-out), the assay has significant potential as a rapid POC diagnostic for Ct infections."
https://openalex.org/W2619119838,"Reforestation is needed globally to help restore degraded sites, combat desertification, protect watersheds, and provide forest products. This involves planting forest tree seedlings grown in local nurseries, but technologies to produce quality seedlings are lacking in developing countries. Modern nursery containers used to propagate seedlings have internal-surface barriers (ribs or ridges) or side-slits to prevent root spiraling. These are cost prohibitive or unavailable in developing countries and so polybags (plastic bags) are more commonly used, despite their tendency to produce seedlings with deformed root systems that have less potential to establish on field sites. Discarded plastic bottles, which are readily available worldwide, may be a feasible alternative for seedling propagation. We conducted two experiments to assess the potential of repurposed plastic beverage bottles to grow quality trees: 1) Container Comparison–to evaluate Arizona walnut (Juglans major [Toor.] Heller) and Afghan pine (Pinus eldarica Medw.) seedling root and shoot development in two plastic bottle types compared to modern nursery containers and polybags, and 2) Bottle Modification–to examine the effects of root spiraling prevention techniques (side-slits, internal-ridges, and control) and container opacity (green, black, and clear) on Afghan pine seedling morphological attributes. Nursery growth and first-year seedling field performance were evaluated for both experiments. In experiment one, seedlings of both species had fewer spiraled roots in bottle containers compared to polybags. Arizona walnut had more fibrous root systems in polybags, while Afghan pine root system fibrosity was greatest in bottle containers. First-year field performance of both species was not affected by container type. In experiment two, less spiraled roots occurred in containers with air-slits and interior-ridges compared to the control. The effects of container opacity on seedling morphology were inconsistent. Root spiral prevention and opacity had no influence on Afghan pine one-year survival, field height and diameter, with the exception of opacity for height growth, whereby seedlings grown in green containers were taller than those grown in black containers, but seedlings grown in clear containers were similar to both. Our results provide the first evidence that plastic bottle containers may provide an effective alternative for production of high quality seedlings, which may benefit agroforestry, reforestation, restoration, and conservation programs in developing countries."
https://openalex.org/W2620134849,"In genetic association studies of rare variants, low statistical power and potential violations of established estimator properties are among the main challenges of association tests. Multi-marker tests (MMTs) have been proposed to target these challenges, but any comparison with single-marker tests (SMTs) has to consider that their aim is to identify causal genomic regions instead of variants. Valid power comparisons have been performed for the analysis of binary traits indicating that MMTs have higher power, but there is a lack of conclusive studies for quantitative traits. The aim of our study was therefore to fairly compare SMTs and MMTs in their empirical power to identify the same causal loci associated with a quantitative trait. The results of extensive simulation studies indicate that previous results for binary traits cannot be generalized. First, we show that for the analysis of quantitative traits, conventional estimation methods and test statistics of single-marker approaches have valid properties yielding association tests with valid type I error, even when investigating singletons or doubletons. Furthermore, SMTs lead to more powerful association tests for identifying causal genes than MMTs when the effect sizes of causal variants are large, and less powerful tests when causal variants have small effect sizes. For moderate effect sizes, whether SMTs or MMTs have higher power depends on the sample size and percentage of causal SNVs. For a more complete picture, we also compare the power in studies of quantitative and binary traits, and the power to identify causal genes with the power to identify causal rare variants. In a genetic association analysis of systolic blood pressure in the Genetic Analysis Workshop 19 data, SMTs yielded smaller p-values compared to MMTs for most of the investigated blood pressure genes, and were least influenced by the definition of gene regions."

Methods We performed a 16-year retrospective study (January 2001 to March 2016) including patients ≤ 18 years with PM. Variables including attack rate of pneumococcal serotype (high or low invasive capacity) and MBL2 genotypes associated with low serum MBL levels were recorded. Results Forty-eight patients were included in the study. Median age was 18.5 months and 17/48 episodes (35.4%) occurred in children ≤ 12 months old. Serotypes with high-invasive disease potential were identified in 15/48 episodes (31.2%). MBL2 deficient genotypes accounted for 18.8% (9/48). Children ≤ 12 months old had a 7-fold risk (95% CI: 1.6–29.9; p < 0.01) of having a MBL2 deficient genotype in comparison to those > 12 months old. A sub-analysis of patients by age group revealed significant proportions of carriers of MBL2 deficient genotypes among those ≤ 12 months old with PM caused by opportunistic serotypes (54.5%), admitted to the PICU (Pediatric Intensive Care Unit) (46.7%) and of White ethnicity (35.7%). These proportions were significantly higher than in older children (all p<0.05). Conclusions Our results suggest that differences in MBL2 genotype in children ≤12 months old affects susceptibility to PM, and it may have an important role in the episodes caused by non-high invasive disease potential serotypes."

First, the sequence of operations has been described, and second, a proposal of design of the equipment has been undertaken. Finally, the impact of the proposal has been analyzed according to real data from the Hospital Universitario Rio Hortega in Valladolid (Spain). In this particular case, by the implementation of the analyzed proposal in the hospital a reduction of over 35% of the current time of use can be achieved. This result may allow adding new tasks to the vehicles, and according to this, both a new kind of vehicle and a specific module can be developed in order to get a better performance."
https://openalex.org/W2619310824,"Bacterial centromeres-also called parS, are cis-acting DNA sequences which, together with the proteins ParA and ParB, are involved in the segregation of chromosomes and plasmids. The specific binding of ParB to parS nucleates the assembly of a large ParB/DNA complex from which ParA-the motor protein, segregates the sister replicons. Closely related families of partition systems, called Bsr, were identified on the chromosomes and large plasmids of the multi-chromosomal bacterium Burkholderia cenocepacia and other species from the order Burkholeriales. The centromeres of the Bsr partition families are 16 bp palindromes, displaying similar base compositions, notably a central CG dinucleotide. Despite centromeres bind the cognate ParB with a narrow specificity, weak ParB-parS non cognate interactions were nevertheless detected between few Bsr partition systems of replicons not belonging to the same genome. These observations suggested that Bsr partition systems could have a common ancestry but that evolution mostly erased the possibilities of cross-reactions between them, in particular to prevent replicon incompatibility. To detect novel similarities between Bsr partition systems, we have analyzed the binding of six Bsr parS sequences and a wide collection of modified derivatives, to their cognate ParB. The study was carried out by Surface Plasmon Resonance imaging (SPRi) mulitplex analysis enabling a systematic survey of each nucleotide position within the centromere. We found that in each parS some positions could be changed while maintaining binding to ParB. Each centromere displays its own pattern of changes, but some positions are shared more or less widely. In addition from these changes we could speculate evolutionary links between these centromeres."
https://openalex.org/W2618241403,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem in Afghanistan, but experience in implementing effective strategies to prevent and control TB in urban areas and conflict zones is limited. This study shares programmatic experience in implementing DOTS in the large city of Kabul. We analyzed data from the 2009–2015 reports of the National TB Program (NTP) for Kabul City and calculated treatment outcomes and progress in case notification using rates, ratios, and confidence interval. Urban DOTS was implemented by the NTP in partnership with United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded TB projects, the World Health Organization (WHO), and the private sector. Between 2009 and 2015, the number of DOTS-providing centers in Kabul increased from 22 to 85. In total, 24,619 TB patients were enrolled in TB treatment during this period. The case notification rate for all forms of TB increased from 59 per 100,000 population to 125 per 100,000. The case notification rate per 100,000 population for sputum-smear-positive TB increased from 25 to 33. The treatment success rate for all forms of TB increased from 31% to 67% and from 47% to 77% for sputum-smear-positive TB cases. The treatment success rate for private health facilities increased from 52% in 2010 to 80% in 2015. In 2013, contact screening was introduced, and the TB yield was 723 per 100,000—more than two times higher than the estimated national prevalence of 340 per 100,000. Contact screening contributed to identifying 2,509 child contacts of people with TB, and 76% of those children received isoniazid preventive therapy. The comprehensive urban DOTS program significantly improved service accessibility, TB case finding, and treatment outcomes in Kabul. Public- and private-sector involvement also improved treatment outcomes; however, the treatment success rate remains higher in private health facilities. While the treatment success rate increased significantly, it remains lower than the national average, and more efforts are needed to improve treatment outcomes in Kabul. We recommend that the urban DOTS approach be replicated in other countries and cities in Afghanistan with settings similar to Kabul."

Patients and methods We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with grade 1 and 2 NETs with liver metastases but without bone metastases seen at our institution in 2013. In total, 49 patients were included (22 female), with a median age of 60 years (range: 28 to 84 years). The primary tumors were located in the duodenum/pancreas (n = 29), small bowel (n = 17) or colon/rectum (n = 3); 10 cases were grade 1 and 39 grade 2. Hepatic involvement was bulky, with more than 10 lesions in 23 patients and a tumor burden above 10% of the liver volume in 26 patients. Results Serum AP levels were elevated (≥ upper limit of normal (ULN)) in 16 patients. In multiparametric analysis, elevated serum AP levels were not associated with the primary site, grade, or number or volume of metastases. In multiparametric analysis, progression-free survival was only correlated with grade (p = 0.010) and AP level (p = 0.017). Conclusions Serum AP levels are frequently normal in liver metastases from NET, even in the event of a major tumor burden, and the serum AP level can be of prognostic value."
https://openalex.org/W2619872687,"There are robust data supporting the contribution of oxaliplatin (L-OHP) regarding clinical outcomes for colorectal cancer (CRC) in an adjuvant setting in European and US trials; however, there is no Japanese clinical evidence although L-OHP has been approved since 2009. We examined the transition of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III colorectal cancer in our institute.A total of 642 patients with histopathologically confirmed stage III CRC underwent curative surgery from 2005 to 2010. We examined disease free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS) and prognostic factors for stage III CRC patients who underwent adjuvant chemotherapy.A total of 509 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. 3-year DFS and 5-year OS rates were 74.5% and 87.5%, respectively. The frequency of inclusion of L-OHP as adjuvant chemotherapy was increased after 2008. A total of 189 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy from 2005 to 2007 increasing to 320 patients from 2008 to 2010; the 5-year OS rates were 82.4% and 91.5%, respectively, and the 3-year DFS rates were 69.2% and 76.6%, respectively (OS, P = 0.007; DFS, P = 0.023). In univariate analysis, adjuvant chemotherapy including L-OHP was no significant deference compared to FU monotherapy. (OS: HR 0.88, 95%CI 0.4-1.91, p = 0.75, DFS: HR 0.78, 95%CI 0.21-2.3, p = 0.29). In multivariate analysis, the OS was predicted by means of N stage (HR = 2; 95%CI, 1.1-3.8; P = 0.02) and pathology (HR = 0.28; 95%CI, 0.13-0.59; P = 0.0008). The DFS was predicted by means of N stage (HR = 2.67; 95%CI, 1.82-3.9; P < 0.05), T stage (HR = 1.61; 95%CI, 1.1-2.3; P = 0.01) pathology (HR = 0.47; 95%CI, 0.29-0.75; P < 0.05) and venous invasion (HR = 2.06; 95%CI, 1.12-3.77; P = 0.01).Clinical outcomes of stage III CRC patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy improved. The frequency of L-OHP usage was increasing annually, however it was no influence for clinical outcomes in this study. It will be necessary to reevaluate additional effect of L-OHP with more patients."
https://openalex.org/W2620002428,"We aimed to determine the prognostic significance of computed tomography imaging parameters of unresectable primary renal tumor lesions, obtained at baseline and at first follow-up, on overall survival in naïve, unresectable metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients during first-line systemic therapy.Clinicopathological parameters of 56 patients treated between 2007 and 2015, including imaging parameters (such as the longest tumor diameter, necrotic area diameter, and attenuation in primary renal tumor lesions on baseline vs. follow-up computed tomography), were retrospectively reviewed to derive predictive factors of overall survival. The best overall response was measured according to the RECIST v1.1.The median treatment period was 206.3 days and the median follow-up was 14.6 months. Forty-four (78.6%) patients progressed after a median 4.6 months of progression-free survival, and 6 (10.7%) patients survived with a median overall survival of 12.5 months. Multivariate analysis showed that the baseline tumor diameter (hazard ratio [HR] 0.903) and mean attenuation (HR 0.936), change of tumor diameter (HR 0.714) and necrosis diameter (HR 0.861), change in the percentage of tumor diameter (HR 1.483) and of necrosis diameter (HR 1.028) between baseline and follow-up computed tomography images; treatment duration (HR 0.986) and baseline serum hemoglobin (HR 1.790) and albumin level (HR 0.060) were significant factors for overall survival (p<0.05).The study showed that baseline and first follow-up computed tomography findings of primary renal lesions during first-line systemic therapy are useful and significant predictors of OS in patients with naïve unresectable mRCC."
