We performed functional and phenotypic characterisation of ion transport in the human pulmonary epithelial cell lines NCI-H441 and A549 to determine their similarity to primary human alveolar type II cells. NCI-H441 cells exhibited high expression of junctional proteins ZO-1, and E-cadherin, seal-forming claudin-3, -4, -5 and Na+-K+-ATPase while A549 cells exhibited high expression of pore-forming claudin-2. Consistent with this phenotype NCI-H441, but not A549, cells formed a functional barrier with active ion transport characterised by higher electrical resistance (529 ± 178 Ω cm2 vs 28 ± 4 Ω cm2), lower paracellular permeability ((176 ± 42) ×10-8 cm/s vs (738 ± 190) ×10-8 cm/s) and higher transepithelial potential difference (11.9 ± 4 mV vs 0 mV). Phenotypic and functional properties of NCI-H441 cells were tuned by varying cell seeding density and supplement concentrations. The cells formed a polarised monolayer typical of in vivo epithelium at seeding densities of 100,000 cells per 12-well insert while higher densities resulted in multiple cell layers. Dexamethasone and insulin-transferrin-selenium supplements were required for the development of high levels of electrical resistance, potential difference and expression of claudin-3 and Na+-K+-ATPase. Treatment of NCI-H441 cells with inhibitors and agonists of sodium and chloride channels indicated sodium absorption through ENaC under baseline and forskolin-stimulated conditions. Chloride transport was not sensitive to inhibitors of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) under either condition. Channels inhibited by 5-nitro-1-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (NPPB) contributed to chloride secretion following forskolin stimulation, but not at baseline. These data precisely define experimental conditions for the application of NCI-H441 cells as a model for investigating ion and water transport in the human alveolar epithelium and also identify the pathways of sodium and chloride transport."
https://openalex.org/W2533003797,"The present investigation was carried out to elucidate a possible molecular mechanism related to the protective effect of quercetin administration against oxidative stress on various mitochondrial respiratory complex subunits with special emphasis on the role of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in mitochondrial biogenesis. Recently, quercetin has been proved to have a protective effect against mitochondria damage after traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, its precise role and underlying mechanisms in traumatic brain injury are not yet fully understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of quercetin on the potential mechanism of these effects in a weight-drop model of TBI in male mice that were treated with quercetin or vehicle via intraperitoneal injection administrated 30 min after TBI. In this experiment, ICR mice were divided into four groups: A sham group, TBI group, TBI + vehicle group, and TBI + quercetin group. Brain samples were collected 24 h later for analysis. Quercetin treatment resulted in an upregulation of Nrf2 expression and cytochrome c, malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels were restored by quercetin treatment. Quercetin markedly promoted the translocation of Nrf2 protein from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. These observations suggest that quercetin improves mitochondrial function in TBI models, possibly by activating the Nrf2 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2537670537,"Cartilage matrix is a composite of discrete, but interacting suprastructures, i.e. cartilage fibers with microfibrillar or network-like aggregates and penetrating extrafibrillar proteoglycan matrix. The biomechanical function of the proteoglycan matrix and the collagen fibers are to absorb compressive and tensional loads, respectively. Here, we are focusing on the suprastructural organization of collagen fibrils and the degradation process of their hierarchical organized fiber architecture studied at high resolution at the authentic location within cartilage. We present electron micrographs of the collagenous cores of such fibers obtained by an improved protocol for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Articular cartilages are permeated by small prototypic fibrils with a homogeneous diameter of 18 ± 5 nm that can align in their D-periodic pattern and merge into larger fibers by lateral association. Interestingly, these fibers have tissue-specific organizations in cartilage. They are twisted ropes in superficial regions of knee joints or assemble into parallel aligned cable-like structures in deeper regions of knee joint- or throughout hip joints articular cartilage. These novel observations contribute to an improved understanding of collagen fiber biogenesis, function, and homeostasis in hyaline cartilage."
https://openalex.org/W2535072167,"The activation of NF-κB downstream of T cell receptor (TCR) engagement is a key signaling step required for normal lymphocyte function during the adaptive immune response. During TCR signaling, the adaptor protein Bcl10 is inducibly recruited to the CARD11 scaffold protein as part of a multicomponent complex that induces IκB kinase (IKK) activity and NF-κB activation. Here, we show that a consequence of this recruitment is the TCR-induced conjugation of Bcl10 with linear-linked polyubiquitin chains to generate the signaling intermediate Lin(Ub)n-Bcl10, which is required for the association of Bcl10 with the NEMO subunit of the IKK complex. The TCR-induced generation of Lin(Ub)n-Bcl10 requires Bcl10 lysines 17, 31, and 63, CARD11, MALT1, and the HOIP subunit of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) but not the HOIP accessory protein SHARPIN. CARD11 promotes signal-induced Lin(Ub)n-Bcl10 generation by co-recruiting Bcl10 with HOIP, thereby bringing substrate to enzyme. The CARD11-HOIP interaction is rendered TCR-inducible by the four autoinhibitory repressive elements in the CARD11 inhibitory domain and involves the CARD11 coiled-coil domain and two independent regions of HOIP. Interestingly, oncogenic CARD11 variants associated with diffuse large B cell lymphoma spontaneously induce Lin(Ub)n-Bcl10 production to extents that correlate with their abilities to activate NF-κB and with their enhanced abilities to bind HOIP and Bcl10. Our results define molecular determinants that control the production of Lin(Ub)n-Bcl10, an important signaling intermediate in TCR and oncogenic CARD11 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2533738919,"Drug shortages were a complex global problem. The aim of this study was to analyze, characterize, and assess the drug shortages, and identify possible solutions in Shaanxi Province, western China.A qualitative methodological approach was conducted during May-June 2015 and December 2015-January 2016. Semi-structured interviews were performed to gather information from representatives of hospital pharmacists, wholesalers, pharmaceutical producers, and local health authorities.Thirty participants took part in the study. Eight traditional Chinese medicines and 87 types of biologicals and chemicals were reported to be in short supply. Most were essential medicines. Five main determinants of drug shortages were detected: too low prices, too low market demands, Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) issues, materials issues, and approval issues for imported drugs. Five different solutions were proposed by the participants: 1) let the market decide the drug price; 2) establish an information platform; 3) establish a reserve system; 4) enhance the communication among the three parties in the supply chain; and 5) improve hospital inventory management.Western China was currently experiencing a serious drug shortage. Numerous reasons for the shortage were identified. Most drug shortages in China were currently because of ""too low prices."" To solve this problem, all of the stakeholders, especially the government, needed to participate in managing the drug shortages."
https://openalex.org/W2539039891,"The processes regulating glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and its modulation by incretins in pancreatic β-cells are only partly understood. Here we investigate the involvement of β-catenin in these processes. Reducing β-catenin levels using siRNA knockdown attenuated GSIS in a range of β-cell models and blocked the ability of GLP-1 agonists and the depolarizing agent KCl to potentiate this. This could be mimicked in both β-cell models and isolated islets by short-term exposure to the β-catenin inhibitory drug pyrvinium. In addition, short-term treatment with a drug that increases β-catenin levels results in an increase in insulin secretion. The timing of these effects suggests that β-catenin is required for the processes regulating trafficking and/or release of pre-existing insulin granules rather than for those regulated by gene expression. This was supported by the finding that the overexpression of the transcriptional co-activator of β-catenin, transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2), attenuated insulin secretion, consistent with the extra TCF7L2 translocating β-catenin from the plasma membrane pool to the nucleus. We show that β-catenin depletion disrupts the intracellular actin cytoskeleton, and by using total internal reflectance fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we found that β-catenin is required for the glucose- and incretin-induced depletion of insulin vesicles from near the plasma membrane. In conclusion, we find that β-catenin levels modulate Ca2+-dependent insulin exocytosis under conditions of glucose, GLP-1, or KCl stimulation through a role in modulating insulin secretory vesicle localization and/or fusion via actin remodeling. These findings also provide insights as to how the overexpression of TCF7L2 may attenuate insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2536974346,"Abstract Halomonas sp. Y2 is a halotolerant alkaliphilic strain from Na+-rich pulp mill wastewater with high alkalinity (pH >11.0). Transcriptome analysis of this isolate revealed this strain may use various transport systems for pH homeostasis. In particular, the genes encoding four putative Na+/H+ antiporters were differentially expressed upon acidic or alkaline conditions. Further evidence, from heterologous expression and mutant studies, suggested that Halomonas sp. Y2 employs its Na+/H+ antiporters in a labor division way to deal with saline and alkaline environments. Ha-NhaD2 displayed robust Na+(Li+) resistance and high transport activities in Escherichia coli; a ΔHa-nhaD2 mutant exhibited growth inhibition at high Na+(Li+) concentrations at pH values of 6.2, 8.0, and 10.0, suggesting its physiological role in osmotic homeostasis. In contrast, Ha-NhaD1 showed much weaker activities in ion exporting and pH homeostasis. Ha-Mrp displayed a combination of properties similar to those of Mrp transporters from some Bacillus alkaliphiles and neutrophiles. This conferred obvious Na+(Li+, K+) resistance in E. coli-deficient strains, as those ion transport spectra of some neutrophil Mrp antiporters. Conversely, similar to the Bacillus alkaliphiles, Ha-Mrp showed central roles in the pH homeostasis of Halomonas sp. Y2. An Ha-mrp-disrupted mutant was seriously inhibited by high concentrations of Na+(Li+, K+) but only under alkaline conditions. Ha-NhaP was determined to be a K+/H+ antiporter and shown to confer strong K+ resistance both at acidic and alkaline stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2537075078,"Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) is a disease caused by Hantavirus, which are negative-sense RNA viruses in the family Bunyaviridae that are highly virulent to humans. Numerous factors modify risk of Hantavirus transmission and consequent HPS risk. Human-driven landscape change can foster transmission risk by increasing numbers of habitat generalist rodent species that serve as the principal reservoir host. Climate can also affect rodent population dynamics and Hantavirus survival, and a number of social factors can influence probability of HPS transmission to humans. Evaluating contributions of these factors to HPS risk may enable predictions of future outbreaks, and is critical to development of effective public health strategies. Here we rely on a Bayesian model to quantify associations between annual HPS incidence across the state of São Paulo, Brazil (1993-2012) and climate variables (annual precipitation, annual mean temperature), landscape structure metrics (proportion of native habitat cover, number of forest fragments, proportion of area planted with sugarcane), and social factors (number of men older than 14 years and Human Development Index). We built separate models for the main two biomes of the state (cerrado and Atlantic forest). In both biomes Hantavirus risk increased with proportion of land cultivated for sugarcane and HDI, but proportion of forest cover, annual mean temperature, and population at risk also showed positive relationships in the Atlantic forest. Our analysis provides the first evidence that social, landscape, and climate factors are associated with HPS incidence in the Neotropics. Our risk map can be used to support the adoption of preventive measures and optimize the allocation of resources to avoid disease propagation, especially in municipalities that show medium to high HPS risk (> 5% of risk), and aimed at sugarcane workers, minimizing the risk of future HPS outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2535836871,"Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA) is a surface-exposed lipoprotein ubiquitously expressed by Neisseria meningitidis strains and an antigen of the Bexsero® vaccine. NHBA binds heparin through a conserved Arg-rich region that is the target of two proteases, the meningococcal NalP and human lactoferrin (hLf). In this work, in vitro studies showed that recombinant NHBA protein was able to bind epithelial cells and mutations of the Arg-rich tract abrogated this binding. All N-terminal and C-terminal fragments generated by NalP or hLf cleavage, regardless of the presence or absence of the Arg-rich region, did not bind to cells, indicating that a correct positioning of the Arg-rich region within the full length protein is crucial. Moreover, binding was abolished when cells were treated with heparinase III, suggesting that this interaction is mediated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). N. meningitidis nhba knockout strains showed a significant reduction in adhesion to epithelial cells with respect to isogenic wild-type strains and adhesion of the wild-type strain was inhibited by anti-NHBA antibodies in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, the results demonstrate that NHBA contributes to meningococcal adhesion to epithelial cells through binding to HSPGs and suggest a possible role of anti-Bexsero® antibodies in the prevention of colonization."
https://openalex.org/W2536108399,"Repetitive low complexity sequences, mostly assumed to have no function, are common in proteins that are exported by the malaria parasite into its host erythrocyte. We identify a group of exported proteins containing short lysine-rich tandemly repeated sequences that are sufficient to localize to the erythrocyte periphery, where key virulence-related modifications to the plasma membrane and the underlying cytoskeleton are known to occur. Efficiency of targeting is dependent on repeat number, indicating that novel targeting modules could evolve by expansion of short lysine-rich sequences. Indeed, analysis of fragments of GARP from different species shows that two novel targeting sequences have arisen via the process of repeat expansion in this protein. In the protein Hyp12, the targeting function of a lysine-rich sequence is masked by a neighboring repetitive acidic sequence, further highlighting the importance of repetitive low complexity sequences. We show that sequences capable of targeting the erythrocyte periphery are present in at least nine proteins from Plasmodium falciparum and one from Plasmodium knowlesi We find these sequences in proteins known to be involved in erythrocyte rigidification and cytoadhesion as well as in previously uncharacterized exported proteins. Together, these data suggest that expansion and contraction of lysine-rich repeats could generate targeting sequences de novo as well as modulate protein targeting efficiency and function in response to selective pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2532179357,"The regionally endemic Galapagos Grouper, locally known as bacalao, is one of the most highly prized finfish species within the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR). Concerns of overfishing, coupled with a lack of fishing regulations aimed at this species raises concerns about the current population health. We assessed changes in population health over a 30-year period using three simple indicators: (1) percentage of fish below reproductive size (Lm); (2) percentage of fish within the optimum length interval (Lopt); and (3) percentage of mega-spawners in the catch. Over the assessed period, none of the indicators reached values associated with healthy populations, with all indicators declining over time. Furthermore, the most recent landings data show that the vast majority of the bacalao caught (95.7%,) were below Lm, the number of fish within the Lopt interval was extremely low (4.7%), and there were virtually no mega-spawners (0.2%). Bacalao fully recruit to the fishery 15 cm below the size at which 50% of the population matures. The Spawning Potential Ratio is currently 5% of potential unfished fecundity, strongly suggesting severe overfishing. Our results suggest the need for bacalao-specific management regulations that should include minimum (65 cm TL) and maximum (78 cm TL) landing sizes, slot limits (64-78 cm TL), as well as a closed season during spawning from October to January. It is recognized that these regulations are harsh and will certainly have negative impacts on the livelihoods of fishers in the short term, however, continued inaction will likely result in a collapse of this economically and culturally valuable species. Alternative sources of income should be developed in parallel with the establishment of fishing regulations to limit the socio-economic disruption to the fishing community during the transition to a more sustainable management regime."
https://openalex.org/W2539079304,"Background The relationship between dyspnea and incident heart failure (HF) and myocardial infarction (MI) among patients without previously diagnosed cardiopulmonary disease is unclear. We studied the prognostic relevance of self-reported dyspnea for cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality in persons without previously diagnosed cardiopulmonary disease. Methods and Results We studied 10 881 community-dwelling participants (mean age 57±6, 56% women, 25% black) who were free of prevalent cardiopulmonary disease from Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. Dyspnea status at study entry using the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale. The primary outcomes were time to HF, MI or all-cause death. Dyspnea prevalence was 22%, and was mild (mMRC grade 1 or 2) in 21% and moderate-to-severe (mMRC 3 or 4) in 1%. The main correlates of dyspnea were older age, female sex, higher BMI and active smoking. Over a follow-up of 19±5 years, greater self-reported dyspnea severity was associated with worse prognosis. Mild dyspnea was associated with significantly heightened risk of HF (adjusted Hazard Ratio, HR,1.30; 95% CI: 1.16–1.46), MI (adjusted HR 1.34; 95%CI: 1.20–1.50), and death (adjusted HR 1.16; 95%CI: 1.06–1.26), with moderate/severe dyspnea associated with an even greater risk (adjusted HR 2.14, 95%CI: 1.59–2.89; 1.93, 95%CI: 1.41–2.56; 1.96, 95%CI: 1.55–2.48, respectively). Conclusion In community-dwelling persons free of previously diagnosed cardiopulmonary disease, self-reported dyspnea is common and, even when of mild intensity, it is independently associated with a greater risk of incident HF, MI, and death. Our data emphasize the prognostic importance of even mild self-reported dyspnea for cardiovascular outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2538900825,"Cytochrome-c-oxidase (COX) deficiency is a frequent cause of mitochondrial disease and is associated with a wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes. We studied mitochondrial function and biogenesis in fibroblasts derived from the Cohen (CDs) rat, an animal model of COX deficiency. COX activity in CDs-fibroblasts was 50% reduced compared to control rat fibroblasts (P<0.01). ROS-production in CDs fibroblasts increased, along with marked mitochondrial fragmentation and decreased mitochondrial membrane-potential, indicating mitochondrial dysfunction. Surprisingly, cellular ATP content, oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were unchanged. To clarify the discrepancy between mitochondrial dysfunction and ATP production, we studied mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover. The content of mitochondria was higher in CDs-fibroblasts. Consistently, AMPK activity and the expression of NRF1-target genes, NRF2 and PGC1-α that mediate mitochondrial biogenesis were increased (P<0.01 vs control fibroblast). In CDs-fibrobalsts, the number of autophagosomes (LC3+ puncta) containing mitochondria in CDs fibroblasts was similar to that in control fibroblasts, suggesting that mitophagy was intact. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress are associated with an increase in mitochondrial biogenesis, resulting in preservation of ATP generation."
https://openalex.org/W2538350682,"FOXO3a, a member of the forkhead homeobox type O (FOXO) family of transcriptional factors, regulates cell survival in response to DNA damage, caloric restriction, and oxidative stress. The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene encodes a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that mediates hypoxia-inducible factor α degradation under aerobic conditions, thus acting as one of the key regulators of hypoxia signaling. However, whether FOXO3a impacts cellular hypoxia stress remains unknown. Here we show that FOXO3a directly binds to the VHL promoter and up-regulates VHL expression. Using a zebrafish model, we confirmed the up-regulation of vhl by foxo3b, an ortholog of mammalian FOXO3a Furthermore, by employing the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology, we deleted foxo3b in zebrafish and determined that expression of hypoxia-inducible genes was affected under hypoxia. Moreover, foxo3b-null zebrafish exhibited impaired acute hypoxic tolerance, resulting in death. In conclusion, our findings suggest that, by modulating hypoxia-inducible factor activity via up-regulation of VHL, FOXO3a (foxo3b) plays an important role in survival in response to hypoxic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2535716286,"Invertases catalyze the hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose and fructose, thereby playing a key role in primary metabolism and plant development. According to the optimum pH, invertases are classified into acid invertases (Ac-Invs) and alkaline/neutral invertases (A/N-Invs), which share no sequence homology. Compared with Ac-Invs that have been extensively studied, the structure and catalytic mechanism of A/N-Invs remain unknown. Here we report the crystal structures of Anabaena alkaline invertase InvA, which was proposed to be the ancestor of modern plant A/N-Invs. These structures are the first in the GH100 family. InvA exists as a hexamer in both crystal and solution. Each subunit consists of an (α/α)6 barrel core structure in addition to an insertion of three helices. A couple of structures in complex with the substrate or products enabled us to assign the subsites −1 and +1 specifically binding glucose and fructose, respectively. Structural comparison combined with enzymatic assays indicated that Asp-188 and Glu-414 are putative catalytic residues. Further analysis of the substrate binding pocket demonstrated that InvA possesses a stringent substrate specificity toward the α1,2-glycosidic bond of sucrose. Together, we suggest that InvA and homologs represent a novel family of glucosidases."
https://openalex.org/W2537911373,"Previous measurements of the rates of polymerization and pyrophosphate release with DNA templates showed that pyrophosphate (PPi) dissociation was fast after nucleotide incorporation so that it did not contribute to enzyme specificity (kcat/Km). Here, kinetic parameters governing nucleotide incorporation and PPi release were determined using an RNA template. Compared with a DNA template of the same sequence, the rate of chemistry increased by up to 10-fold (250 versus 24 s−1), whereas the rate of PPi release decreased to approximately 58 s−1 so that PPi release became the rate-limiting step. During processive nucleotide incorporation, the first nucleotide (TTP) was incorporated at a fast rate (152 s−1), whereas the rates of incorporation of remaining nucleotides (CGTCG) were much slower with an average rate of 24 s−1, suggesting that sequential incorporation events were limited by the relatively slow PPi release step. The accompanying paper shows that slow PPi release allows polymerization and RNase H to occur at comparable rates. Although PPi release is the rate-determining step, it is not the specificity-determining step for correct incorporation based on our current estimates of the rate of reversal of the chemistry step (3 s−1). In contrast, during misincorporation, PPi release became extremely slow, which we estimated to be ∼0.002 s−1. These studies establish the mechanistic basis for DNA polymerase fidelity during reverse transcription and provide a free energy profile. We correct previous underestimates of discrimination by including the slow PPi release step. Our current estimate of 2.4 × 106 is >20-fold greater than estimated previously.

Our recent measurements of the rates of polymerization and pyrophosphate release by HIVRT in single turnover experiments with DNA templates showed that pyrophosphate (PPi) dissociation was fast after nucleotide incorporation so that it did not contribute to enzyme specificity (kcat/Km). 3A.

Herein, we examine how the slow PPi dissociation affects the nucleotide selectivity by HIVRT.

Previous data from this laboratory have shown that slow PPi release provided a novel type of proofreading mechanism by allowing for the reversal of chemistry (20.Hanes J.W. Thal D.M. Johnson K.A.

In this study the kinetics of correct and incorrect nucleotide incorporation were further examined to evaluate whether slow PPi release could bring the in vitro results in closer agreement with the in vivo data. Fig. 1A shows the time dependence of nucleotide incorporation measured by rapid chemical quench flow methods after mixing a preformed enzyme·DNA complex (175 nm MDCC-labeled WT_HIVRT and 75 nm d25/d45; Table 1) with various concentrations of TTP. Fig. 1B shows the time dependence of the fluorescence change measured by stopped flow during PPi release, coupled to hydrolysis, and then binding of phosphate to the fluorescently labeled phosphate-binding protein. The data were fit globally, as illustrated by the smooth curves in each panel, to derive the rate constants summarized in Scheme 1 and Table 2. The apparent binding affinity of TTP (Kd,app) was 3.5 ± 0.4 μm, and kpol was 24 ± 0.1 s−1, yielding a kpol/Kd,app value as 6.9 ± 0.8 μm−1s−1. The time course of PPi release was coincident with the rate of the chemistry step, and accordingly, confidence contour analysis set a lower limit of ∼500 s−1 for the rate constant governing PPi release.TABLE 1DNA and RNA substrates for kinetic assaysd25/r45d25, 5′-GCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA-3′r45, 3′-CGGAGCGUCGGCAGGUUGGUUGAGUAGCAGCUAGGUUACGGCAGG-5′d25pC/r45pGd25pC, 5′-GCCTCCCCCCCCCCCAACCAACTCA-3′r45pG, 3′-CGGAGGGGGGGGGGGUUGGUUGAGUAGCAGCUAGGUUACGGCAGG-5′d25dd/r45d25dd,5′-GCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCAdd-3′r45, 3′-CGGAGCGUCGGCAGGUUGGUUGAGUAGCAGCUAGGUUACGGCAGG-5′d26/r45d26, 5′-GCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCAT-3′r45, 3′-CGGAGCGUCGGCAGGUUGGUUGAGUAGCAGCUAGGUUACGGCAGG-5′d25/d45d25, 5′-GCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA-3′d45, 3′-CGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTAGCAGCTAGGTTACGGCAGG-5′d25/d45tgcd25, 5′-GCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA-3′d45tgc, 3′-CGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTTGCAGCTAGGTTACGGCAGG-5′d25/d45gtcd25, 5′-GCCTCGCAGCCGTCCAACCAACTCA-3′d45gtc, 3′-CGGAGCGTCGGCAGGTTGGTTGAGTGTCAGCTAGGTTACGGCAGG-5′ Open table in a new tab SCHEME 1.The simplified model of TTP incorporation and PPi release with a DNA template.

The data were fit to a sequential incorporation model as shown in Scheme 2. Rates for the first, second, and third nucleotide incorporations were 23 ± 2, 17 ± 4, and 36 ± 10 s−1 for d25/d45tgc and 14 ± 1, 26 ± 3, and 30 ± 5 s−1 for d25/d45gtc. These results are consistent with the fast PPi release rate (> 500 s−1) measured in the single turnover experiment because the rates are all comparable and appear to be limited by the rate of the chemistry step. The kinetics of TTP binding, incorporation, and subsequent PPi release were then examined using an RNA template. Five experiments (Fig. 2) were conducted and fit simultaneously to a single model as illustrated by Scheme 3. Fig. 2A shows the time dependence of nucleotide incorporation measured by rapid chemical-quench flow methods at several nucleotide concentrations. Fig. 2B shows the time course of fluorescence changes upon nucleotide binding and incorporation at various nucleotide concentrations. Fig. 2C shows the time course of fluorescence increase during nucleotide dissociation from the enzyme·DNAdd/RNA·TTP ternary complex when the free nucleotide was trapped by unlabeled enzyme·DNA/RNA duplex. Fig. 2D shows the time dependence of the fluorescence change measured by stopped-flow to monitor PPi release in a coupled assay involving hydrolysis and then binding of phosphate to the fluorescent Pi sensor. Fig. 2E shows the time dependence of pyrophosphorolysis measured by hand quenching at several PPi concentrations.

Open table in a new tab The rate constant governing the conformational change step, k2, was too fast to measure at 37 °C. Therefore, the experiments shown in Fig. 2B were repeated at lower temperatures to derive the maximum rate of nucleotide-induced conformational change (k2) because it was too fast to be measured at 37 °C. Traditionally, the extrapolation was achieved by Arrhenius plot. Here, we fit the temperature-dependent data globally to obtain the rate constants at 37 °C (Fig. 3). Briefly, a series of experiments covering a range of temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 °C) was performed, then the family of curves were fit simultaneously to a single set of rate constants (Scheme 3) at the reference temperature (37 °C) and a corresponding set of activation energy terms to cover the range of temperatures. Global data fitting provided a maximum rate of k2 = 3200 ± 90 s−1 and ground state dissociation constant, 1/K1 = 520 ± 5 μm at 37 °C. The value of k2 was then fixed in the fitting of all five experiments shown in Fig. 2 such that all remaining rate constants were derived from the global data fitting of data in Fig. 2 (Table 3). The rate of TTP release from a pre-formed ternary complex was measured by mixing the closed complex with unlabeled trap (Fig. 2C). 3′-Dideoxy-terminated primer was used in this assay to block the chemistry step. Because the ground state binding of TTP is a fast equilibrium process, re-opening of the ternary complex is the rate-limiting step for TTP dissociation and was defined by the assay. This yielded a k−2 value of 3 ± 0.1 s−1, which was well constrained in the global fitting according to confidence contour analysis (not shown). The rate of chemistry was 250 ± 25 s−1, which was 10-fold faster than the rate obtained with a DNA template (24 ± 0.1 s−1, Fig. 1A and Scheme 1), consistent with prior single turnover measurements (44.Suo Z.

The rate of PPi release was examined using a coupled assay previously developed in our laboratory (46.Hanes J.W. Johnson K.A. Real-time measurement of pyrophosphate release kinetics.Anal. Biochem. 2008; 372: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) in which PPi released from the reaction was hydrolyzed by the pyrophosphatase, yielding inorganic phosphate, which then bound to the fluorescently labeled Escherichia coli phosphate-binding protein (PBP) to give the fluorescence signal (Fig. 2D). The kinetics of PPi hydrolysis and Pi binding to MDCC-PBP were calibrated as previously described.3 Interestingly, the fitting afforded a PPi release rate of 58 ± 2 s−1 that was ∼4-fold slower than the rate of chemistry. Therefore, product release became the rate-limiting step (Fig. 2D). Consequently, due to the slow PPi release step, the rate constant governing the reversal of chemistry (k−3) was able to be accurately determined as 3.5 ± 0.5 s−1 by measuring the kinetics of pyrophosphorolysis (Fig. 2E).

https://openalex.org/W2307624929,"Based on complex network theory, we propose a computational methodology which addresses the spatial distribution of fuel breaks for the inhibition of the spread of wildland fires on heterogeneous landscapes. This is a two-level approach where the dynamics of fire spread are modeled as a random Markov field process on a directed network whose edge weights are determined by a Cellular Automata model that integrates detailed GIS, landscape and meteorological data. Within this framework, the spatial distribution of fuel breaks is reduced to the problem of finding network nodes (small land patches) which favour fire propagation. Here, this is accomplished by exploiting network centrality statistics. We illustrate the proposed approach through (a) an artificial forest of randomly distributed density of vegetation, and (b) a real-world case concerning the island of Rhodes in Greece whose major part of its forest was burned in 2008. Simulation results show that the proposed methodology outperforms the benchmark/conventional policy of fuel reduction as this can be realized by selective harvesting and/or prescribed burning based on the density and flammability of vegetation. Interestingly, our approach reveals that patches with sparse density of vegetation may act as hubs for the spread of the fire."
https://openalex.org/W2536140742,"HIV reverse transcriptase plays a central role in viral replication and requires coordination of both polymerase and RNase H activities. Although this coordination is crucial in viral replication, whether a DNA/RNA hybrid can simultaneously engage both active sites has yet to be determined as structural and kinetic analyses have provided contradictory results. Single nucleotide incorporation and RNase H cleavage were examined using presteady-state kinetics with global data analysis. The results revealed three interconverting reverse transcriptase-DNA/RNA species; 43% were active for both sites simultaneously, 27% showed only polymerase activity, and the remaining 30% were nonproductive. Our data clearly demonstrated that the DNA/RNA hybrid could contact both active sites simultaneously, although the single nucleotide incorporation (105 s−1) was ∼5-fold faster than the cleavage (23 s−1). By using a series of primers with different lengths, we found that a string of at least 4–6 nucleotides downstream of the cleaving site was required for efficient RNA cleavage. This was corroborated by our observations that during processive nucleotide incorporation, sequential rounds of RNA cleavage occurred each time after ∼6 nucleotides were incorporated. More importantly, during processive primer extension, pyrophosphate (PPi) release was rate-limiting so that the average rate of nucleotide incorporation (∼28 s−1) was comparable with that of net RNA cleavage (∼27 nucleotides(s)). Although polymerization is efficient and processive, RNase H is inefficient and periodic. This combination allows the two catalytic centers of HIVRT to work simultaneously at similar speeds without being tightly coupled.

The p66 subunit has two active sites, namely the N-terminal polymerase and the C-terminal RNase H, which perform DNA- and RNA-dependent DNApolymerization and RNase H cleavage, respectively. The two active sites are separated by ∼60 Å, spanning 18 base pairs of a DNA/RNA (primer/template) hybrid (1.Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr, A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L.

Despite the long distance, the process of reverse transcription requires a close coordination between the two catalytic centers during minus-strand DNA synthesis. As the polymerase copies the viral RNA genome, the RNase H site degrades the recently copied RNA segments to free the nascent DNA strand so that it may serve as the template for plus-strand DNA synthesis and to facilitate template strand transfer. The fact that three activities of HIVRT evolved to be present in a single protein and that their coupled activities are required during reverse transcription suggested a possible spatial and temporal coordination between the two active sites. This hypothesis has been supported by several lines of evidence. First, RNase H in homologous enzymes is able to function independently; however, the isolated RNase H domain of HIVRT is inactive, although its nuclease activity could be partially restored by adding various N- or C-terminal extensions (3.Hostomsky Z.

Second, the first RNA cleavage event occurs 18 base pairs from the 3′-OH and is 7-fold slower than DNA synthesis but proceeds without a lag phase (2.Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. Mechanism and fidelity of HIV reverse transcriptase.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the two reactions can occur simultaneously. Subsequent RNase H cleavage events result in shorter products, but in the presence of a trap to inhibit substrate rebinding only the 18–19-nt products were observed, suggesting that sequential RNase H cleavage events are slow relative to dissociation of the DNA/RNA duplex from the enzyme (9.Gopalakrishnan V. Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 reverse transcriptase: spatial and temporal relationship between the polymerase and RNase H activities.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 10763-10767Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Finally, a more recent biochemical study suggested that HIVRT can simultaneously engage its DNA/RNA substrate at both active sites based on the observations that small ligands capable of stabilizing the nucleic acid in the polymerase active site only affected the pattern but not the efficiency of RNA cleavage under single-turnover conditions (10.Beilhartz G.L. Wendeler M. Baichoo N. Rausch J. Le Grice S. Götte M.

Biol. 2009; 388: 462-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Despite the abundance of HIVRT structures, only three of them were in complex with a DNA/RNA hybrid, and none of them exhibited an RNase H-competent mode (1.Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr, A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E.

Therefore, the structural basis for the mechanism by which the two catalytic centers might coordinate with each other is still elusive. One study suggested that by positioning the DNA primer strand the “RNase H primer grip” might also help to determine the trajectory of the hybrid substrate around the RNase H active site and thereby play an important role in coupling the two active sites (1.Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Tantillo C. Clark Jr, A.D. Ding J. Whitcomb J.M. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Crystal structure of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase in complex with a polypurine tract RNA:DNA.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1449-1461Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). A later biochemical study then revealed that the cleavage specificity by RNase H could be modified by altering the RNase H primer grip (13.Rausch J.W. Lener D. Miller J.T. Julias J.G. Hughes S.H. Le Grice S.F. Altering the RNase H primer grip of human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase modifies cleavage specificity.Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4856-4865Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Whether the two active sites of HIVRT are able to act simultaneously is still under debate as structural and biochemical data suggested that primer extension and template degradation may be mutually exclusive and might occur sequentially. An attempt to model a DNA/RNA hybrid into the RNase H active site of HIVRT revealed that even with a severe bending, the substrate was not able to simultaneously occupy the two catalytic centers (14.Nowotny M. Gaidamakov S.A. Ghirlando R. Cerritelli S.M. Crouch R.J. Yang W. Structure of human RNase H1 complexed with an RNA/DNA hybrid: insight into HIV reverse transcription.Mol Cell. 2007; 28: 264-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). These structural analyses suggested a “toggling” model, where the bound substrate must toggle between the two active sites of HIVRT, presumably through conformational changes in the enzyme·DNA/RNA complex. The rate of primer extension was determined to be 7-fold faster than that of RNA cleavage monitored simultaneously on a millisecond time scale (2.Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. Mechanism and fidelity of HIV reverse transcriptase.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the template was not degraded processively in RNA-dependent extension assays (15.DeStefano J.J. Buiser R.G. Mallaber L.M. Myers T.W. Bambara R.A. Fay P.J. Polymerization and RNase H activities of the reverse transcriptases from avian myeloblastosis, human immunodeficiency, and Moloney murine leukemia viruses are functionally uncoupled.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7423-7431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both of which are inconsistent with the tight temporal coupling between the two active sites. Moreover, RNA cleavage tended to occur more efficiently when primer extension paused before a hairpin on the RNA template (16.Purohit V. Roques B.P. Kim B. Bambara R.A.

RNA secondary structure switching during DNA synthesis catalyzed by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14778-14785Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). NNRTIs (non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors) inhibitory to DNA synthesis were able to activate RNA cleavage, presumably through increasing the accessibility of the DNA/RNA hybrid substrate to the RNase H site (19.Shaw-Reid C.A. Feuston B. Munshi V. Getty K. Krueger J. Hazuda D.J. Parniak M.A. Miller M.D. Lewis D. Dissecting the effects of DNA polymerase and ribonuclease H inhibitor combinations on HIV-1 reverse-transcriptase activities.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 1595-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it has been proposed that the nucleic acid substrate could only engage one active site at one time, but the data are not compelling. In the present study, whether a DNA/RNA hybrid can simultaneously engage both active sites was further explored using presteady-state kinetics together with global data analysis to simultaneously examine polymerization and RNase H cleavage during processive polymerization and in single turnover kinetic assays. These studies reveal a novel mechanism of coordinating the two activities by coupling efficient processive polymerization with inefficient and periodic RNase H cleavage. To measure nucleotide incorporation and polymerase-dependent RNase H cleavage activities simultaneously, a double-labeled DNA/RNA substrate with a 25-nt primer recessed at the 3′-end on a 45-nt RNA template was designed (d25/r45, Fig. 1A). Because sequence preferences have been observed for DNA 3′-end-directed RNase H cleavage (20.Schultz S.J. Zhang M. Champoux J.J. Multiple nucleotide preferences determine cleavage-site recognition by the HIV-1 and M-MuLV RNases H.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 397: 161-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), a string of Gs covering the cleavage window was placed in the template to avoid effects due to nucleotide preferences. Primer extension and template degradation were then studied simultaneously by rapid quench-flow methods under single turnover conditions, and both activities were monitored within a single time frame (Fig. 1B). During TTP incorporation, RNA cleavage products mainly accumulated at positions −18 and −17, with minor bands formed at positions −16 and −15. It has been reported that the high resolution site-specific footprinting was indicative of the translocation status of HIVRT (21.Marchand B. Götte M. Site-specific footprinting reveals differences in the translocation status of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase: implications for polymerase translocation and drug resistance.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35362-35372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), so we initially thought that the cleavage pattern observed here may have also reflected translocation stages of HIVRT on the DNA/RNA hybrid before and after nucleotide incorporation. Note that our nomenclature for naming the cleavage site is static (Fig. 1A), so that after primer extension, cleavage 18 base pairs from the new primer terminus resulted in a −17 product, numbered based upon the starting material. This nomenclature was chosen so that a given band is consistently named even when we do not know the primer length during a given cleavage event when measuring both reactions simultaneously (as in Fig. 1). Accordingly, one might expect to see cleavage at −18 before polymerization and −17 after a single TTP incorporation. However, control experiments performed in the absence of nucleotides revealed that the DNA 3′-end-directed RNA cleavage failed to strictly follow the translocation status of RT (Fig. 2A). For substrate d25/r45, cleavage occurred predominately at position −18 but with minor products at −17 and −16. However, when 26-nt primers were used, cleavage products accumulated at 4 distinct positions instead of the two that were predicted for the pre- and post-translocation stages. To further analyze our data, polymerization and cleavage were plotted versus time (Fig. 1, C and D, respectively). Both the incorporation and cleavage data were biphasic, so rates of TTP incorporation and concomitant RNA degradation were estimated by fitting each trace to a double-exponential equation. The results showed that TTP was incorporated at a rate of 107 ± 11 s−1, which was 6∼7-fold faster than the template degradation at 17 ± 2 s−1, derived from the fast phase of each reaction. This difference in rates of incorporation versus cleavage was consistent with our previous data (2.Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. Mechanism and fidelity of HIV reverse transcriptase.J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage rates measured in the absence of nucleotides were determined as 7.7 ± 1.7 s−1 and 10.2 ± 1.9 s−1 for the 25-nt and 26-nt primers, which were a bit slower than the cleavage during TTP incorporation (Figs. 1D and 2B). Rates for the slower phase were ∼0.5 s−1, which could be attributed to DNA/RNA dissociation and rebinding to the enzyme, discussed further below.FIGURE 2.RNA cleavage of substrates before or after primer extension. A, the 45-nt RNA template (r45) was annealed to 25-nt, 26-nt, or 26ddT (26-nt terminated with ddT) primers to mimic substrates before or after nucleotides (TTP or ddTTP) incorporation. An RNA cleavage assay for each substrate was performed as mentioned in Figs. 3 and 4. The 45-nt RNA template and RNase H cleavages at positions −18 to −15 are marked. B, the data showing the time dependence of RNA cleavage of various DNA/RNA hybrids were analyzed by conventional fitting; the inset better displays data points <1 s. Cleavage data were fit to the double-exponential equation to derive rates measured with d25/r45, d26/r45, and 26ddT/r45 as 7.7 ± 1.7 s−1, 10.2 ± 1.9 s−1, and 12 ± 3 s−1 for the fast phase and 0.3 ± 0.1 s−1, 0.4 ± 0.1 s−1, and 0.5 ± 0.1 s−1 for the slower phase, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Incorporation and cleavage activities were observed simultaneously, but this observation did not exclude a sequential polymerization-hydrolysis model because incorporation was faster and, therefore, could have been completed before the RNA cleavage. To test this scenario we explored RNA cleavage activity during ddTTP incorporation, which was much slower than TTP incorporation. A similar cleavage pattern was observed, with the major or minor products accumulating at positions −18 and −17 or at positions −16 and −15, respectively (Fig. 1B, right panel). The rate of ddTTP incorporation (5 ± 0.3 s−1) was determined to be much slower than TTP incorporation (107 ± 11 s−1) but was slightly slower than the RNA cleavage (12 ± 0.7 s−1). Concomitant polymerase and RNase H activities were still observed even if they had comparable rates, suggesting that the two active sites were able to function simultaneously and independently. That is, the DNA/RNA duplex can simultaneously engage both active sites, and the two activities occur independently. It is important to note that in the single turnover experiment, if the two reactions had occurred sequentially, one would have expected to see a lag in the second reaction that is a function of the rate of the first reaction, but no lag was observed. Conventional fitting of the above data provided some evidence that the two catalytic centers of HIVRT work independently. However, conventional analyses were unable to rule out the possibility that the simultaneous activities observed previously were due to mixed enzyme states where one enzyme catalyzes polymerization, whereas another catalyzes RNase H hydrolysis. Conventional fitting largely ignores the amplitude of the reaction, whereas information to distinguish whether a single enzyme species catalyzes both reactions simultaneously lies in analysis of the relative amplitudes of the reactions. The inherent relationships between the rates and amplitudes of the incorporation and cleavage reactions provide more information to determine whether both reactions occur simultaneously. This can be investigated using global data fitting. Global data analysis was first performed for the four experiments measuring TTP incorporation (Fig. 1B, bottom left), concomitant RNA cleavage (Fig. 1B, upper left), and RNase H activities of RT against substrates before or after (Fig. 2A) primer extension. Data were fit using a minimal model shown in Scheme 1, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Distinct from the conventional data fitting where the concentration of products of various lengths was summed to define the net reaction rate, for global fitting each band was quantified and analyzed individually. Fig. 3A shows the time course of primer extension during TTP incorporation, whereas Fig. 3B shows the simultaneous accumulation of RNase H cleavage products. Fig. 3, C and D, show the time course of RNase H cleavage of substrates that represent the state before and after primer extension, respectively (25- and 26-nt primers). The smooth lines represent the global fit to the entire data set according to Scheme 1. The comprehensive mechanism showed in Scheme 1 was derived as a minimal model to account for the data shown in Fig. 3. In this model, we allow for RNase H cleavage before and after polymerization to account for simultaneous reactions from the productive ED25R45 complex. We include an inactive state (XD25R45) and a state that only catalyzes polymerization (YD25R45) to account for the lower reaction amplitudes. Although the model shown in Scheme 1 may appear to be complex, rates of the same reactions from different states were linked to be identical, thereby reducing the complexity and number of unknowns so that the parameters are all well constrained based on confidence contour analysis (22.Johnson K.A. Simpson Z.B. Blom T. FitSpace explorer: an algorithm to evaluate multidimensional parameter space in fitting kinetic data.Anal. Biochem. 2009; 387: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Our data clearly showed that the majority of species represent the active form of RT·DNA/RNA complexes that could perform both activities simultaneously (ED25R45). It is evident from the data that neither the 25-nt primer (Fig. 3A, red curve) nor the 45-nt RNA template (Fig. 3B, red curve) decayed with a single fast rate, suggesting the existence of a nonproductive form of RT·DNA/RNA complexes (XD25R45) that slowly converts to the active state accounting for the slow phase. The amplitude of the fast phase of decay of the 25-nt species (due to polymerization) was approximately the same as the sum of amplitudes of the fast and slower phases of 45-nt depletion (RNase H), suggesting that a fraction of polymerase-competent RT·DNA/RNA complexes was not active for RNase H cleavage (species YD25R45) and the slower phase of 45-nt RNA consumption was due to the delayed switch from the inactive form (YD25R45) to the active form (ED25R45). Apparent equilibria between the three species were determined by the ratios of the amplitudes; the ratio of amplitudes of fast and slower phases of TTP incorporation determined the equilibrium between the polymerase active and inactive forms (YD25R45 + ED25R45, 70%; XD25R45, 30%), whereas the ratio of amplitudes of fast and slower phases of RNA cleavage determined the equilibrium between the bifunctional and polymerase-only forms (ED25R45, 43%; YD25R45, 27%). Rates of conversions among those species were listed in Scheme 1 and Table 1. The results showed that conversions between the active and inactive forms were very slow, with the forward and reverse rates of ∼0.014 and ∼0.012 s−1, respectively. The polymerase-only form (YD25R45) switched to the bi-functional form (ED25R45) at a rate of 0.5 s−1, which was in good agreement with the rate of slower phase (0.5 ± 0.1 s−1) obtained from the conventional fitting of the cleavage data (Fig. 1D). Incorporation rates were determined as 105 s−1 for correct base pairing and 1.4 s−1 for formation of a mismatch (27-mer). Rates of RNA cleavage before primer extension were 20 s−1 at position −18 and 3 s−1 at position −17, consistent with the strong bias toward −18 cleavage observed in the control experiment (Fig. 2). Rates of RNA cleavage after primer extension were 5, 4, 2.5, and 1.5 s−1 for cleavages at positions −18 to −15, respectively. The sum of all rates in a branched pathway yielded net rates of RNA cleavage before and after primer extension as 23 and 13 s−1, respectively. Therefore, the observed rate of 17 ± 2 s−1 determined from the conventional fitting (Fig. 1D) appears to be an average rate combining these two reactions. Secondary cuts also occurred, as cleavage products corresponding to position −18 increased with time at the beginning but eventually decreased (Fig. 3, B and D, green curves), the rate of which, however, was much slower (∼0.05 s−1), suggesting that it was inefficient.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters governing nucleotide incorporation and RNase H cleavageNucleotidesk1k2k3k4k5k6k7k8k9k10k11k12k13s−1s−1s−1s−1s−1s−1s−1s−1s−1s−1s−1s−1s−1TTP0.014 (0.009∼0.05)aIndividual rate constants k1 and k2 were not well defined by the data, as illustrated by the relatively wide range of values.

Open table in a new tab A similar data analysis was performed for RNA cleavage during ddTTP incorporation (Fig. 4) to explore the effect of a slower polymerization rate on the RNase H activity. Rate constants governing the equilibrium between various RT·DNA/RNA complexes, nucleotide incorporation, and RNA cleavage were derived from the global data fitting and summarized in Scheme 2 and Table 1. Similar to our analysis of TTP incorporation, the nonproductive (37%), polymerase-competent only (22%), and bi-functional species (41%) of RT·DNA/RNA complexes were also identified. The rate of ddTTP incorporation was determined as 5 s−1, which was consistent with the number obtained from conventional fitting (5 ± 0.3 s−1). The rate of RNA cleavage before ddTTP incorporation was 11.8 s−1, equal to the sum of 9.6 and 2.2 s−1 to form −18 and −17 cleavage products, respectively. A net rate of 8.4 s−1 was determined for RNA cleavage after primer extension, with comparable rates derived for cleavages at various positions (−18, 1.8 s−1; −17, 2.4 s−1; −16, 2 s−1; −15, 2.2 s−1). The cleavage rates were also consistent with the value (12 ± 0.7 s−1) derived from the conventional fitting (Fig. 1D). Again, the secondary cuts (those acting on the products of the first cleavage) occurred at very slow rates of ∼0.01 and 0.05 s−1, re"

Although Staphylococcus aureus is associated with purulent SSTI, it is unclear to what degree this pathogen causes nonpurulent cellulitis. To inform effective prevention strategies and to provide novel insights into SSTI pathogenesis, we aimed to determine the etiology of SSTI in this population. We conducted a prospective observational study in US Army Infantry trainees with SSTI (cutaneous abscesses and cellulitis) from July 2012 through December 2014. We used standard microbiology, serology, and high-throughput sequencing to determine the etiology of SSTI. Furthermore, we compared purported risk factors as well as anatomic site colonization for S. aureus. Among 201 SSTI cases evaluated for SSTI risk factors, cellulitis was associated with lower extremity blisters (P = 0.01) and abscess was associated with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) colonization (P<0.001). Among the 22 tested cellulitis cases that were part of the microbiome analysis, only 1 leading edge aspirate was culturable (Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus). Microbiome evaluation of aspirate specimens demonstrated that Rhodanobacter terrae was the most abundant species (66.8% average abundance), while abscesses were dominated by S. aureus (92.9% average abundance). Although abscesses and cellulitis share the spectrum of clinical SSTI, the bacterial etiologies as determined by current technology appear distinct. Furthermore, the presence of atypical bacteria within cellulitis aspirates may indicate novel mechanisms of cellulitis pathogenesis. Clinical Trials Registration: NCT01105767."

LIM-only protein 4 (LMO4) and LIM-domain binding protein 1 (LDB1), two directly interacting transcriptional adaptors that have important roles in normal epithelial cell differentiation, have been associated with increased metastasis, decreased differentiation, and shortened survival in carcinoma of the breast. Here, we implicate two LDB1-binding proteins, single-stranded binding protein 2 (SSBP2) and 3 (SSBP3), in controlling LMO4 and LDB1 protein abundance in HNSCC and in regulating specific tumor cell functions in this disease. First, we found that the relative abundance of LMO4, LDB1, and the two SSBPs correlated very significantly in a panel of human HNSCC cell lines. Second, expression of these proteins in tumor primaries and lymph nodes involved by metastasis were concordant in 3 of 3 sets of tissue. Third, using a Matrigel invasion and organotypic reconstruct assay, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of LDB1 in the VU-SCC-1729 cell line, which is highly invasive of basement membrane and cellular monolayers, reduced tumor cell invasiveness and migration, as well as proliferation on tissue culture plastic. Finally, inactivation of the LDB1 gene in these cells decreased growth and vascularization of xenografted human tumor cells in vivo. These data show that LMO4, LDB1, and SSBP2 and/or SSBP3 regulate metastasis, proliferation, and angiogenesis in HNSCC and provide the first evidence that SSBPs control LMO4 and LDB1 protein abundance in a cancer context."
https://openalex.org/W2534154827,"Forest regeneration following timber harvest is a principal source of habitat for early-successional birds and characterized by influxes of early-successional vegetation and residual downed woody material. Early-successional birds may use harvest residues for communication, cover, foraging, and nesting. Yet, increased market viability of woody biomass as bioenergy feedstock may intensify harvest residue removal. Our objectives were to: 1) evaluate effects of varying intensities of woody biomass harvest on the early-successional bird community; and (2) document early-successional bird use of harvest residues in regenerating stands. We spot-mapped birds from 15 April– 15 July, 2012–2014, in six woody biomass removal treatments within regenerating stands in North Carolina (n = 4) and Georgia (n = 4), USA. Treatments included clearcut harvest followed by: (1) traditional woody biomass harvest with no specific retention target; (2) 15% retention with harvest residues dispersed; (3) 15% retention with harvest residues clustered; (4) 30% retention with harvest residues dispersed; (5) 30% retention with harvest residues clustered; and (6) no woody biomass harvest (i.e., reference site). We tested for treatment-level effects on breeding bird species diversity and richness, early-successional focal species territory density (combined and individual species), counts of breeding birds detected near, in, or on branches of harvest piles/windrows, counts of breeding bird behaviors, and vegetation composition and structure. Pooled across three breeding seasons, we delineated 536 and 654 territories and detected 2,489 and 4,204 birds in the North Carolina and Georgia treatments, respectively. Woody biomass harvest had limited or short-lived effects on the early-successional, breeding bird community. The successional trajectory of vegetation structure, rather than availability of harvest residues, primarily drove avian use of regenerating stands. However, many breeding bird species used downed wood in addition to vegetation, indicating that harvest residues initially may provide food and cover resources for early-successional birds in regenerating stands prior to vegetation regrowth."

This study aims to determine the psychometric properties of a new 8-item palliative care outcome scale of symptom burden (IPOS Neuro-S8) in this population.

Results Of the 134 participants, MS patients had a mean Extended Disability Status Scale score 7.8 (SD = 1.0), patients with an IPD, MSA or PSP were in Hoehn & Yahr stage 3–5. The IPOS Neuro-S8 had high data quality (2% missing), mean score 8 (SD = 5; range 0–32), no ceiling effects, borderline floor effects, good internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.7) and moderate test-retest reliability (intraclass coefficient = 0.6). The results supported a moderately correlated two-factor structure (Pearson’s r = 0.5). It was moderately correlated with generic and condition specific measures (Pearson’s r: 0.5–0.6). There was some evidence for discriminant validity in IPD, MSA and PSP (p = 0.020), and for good responsiveness and longitudinal construct validity. Conclusions IPOS Neuro-S8 shows acceptable to promising psychometric properties in common forms of progressive LTNCs. Future work needs to confirm these findings with larger samples and its usefulness in wider disease groups."
https://openalex.org/W2533401890,"The presence of pan-resistant bacteria worldwide possesses a threat to global health. It is difficult to evaluate the extent of carriage of resistant bacteria in the population. Sewage sampling is a possible way to monitor populations. We evaluated the presence of pan-resistant bacteria in Israeli sewage collected from all over Israel, by modifying the pour plate method for heterotrophic plate count technique using commercial selective agar plates. This method enables convenient and fast sewage sampling and detection. We found that sewage in Israel contains multiple pan-resistant bacteria including carbapenemase resistant Enterobacteriacae carrying blaKPC and blaNDM-1, MRSA and VRE. blaKPC carrying Klebsiella pneumonia and Enterobacter cloacae were the most common Enterobacteriacae drug resistant bacteria found in the sewage locations we sampled. Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli and Citrobacter spp. were the 4 main CRE isolated from Israeli sewage and also from clinical samples in our clinical microbiology laboratory. Hospitals and Community sewage had similar percentage of positive samplings for blaKPC and blaNDM-1. VRE was found to be more abundant in sewage in Israel than MRSA but there were more locations positive for MRSA and VRE bacteria in Hospital sewage than in the Community. Therefore, our upgrade of the pour plate method for heterotrophic plate count technique using commercial selective agar plates can be a useful tool for routine screening and monitoring of the population for pan-resistant bacteria using sewage."
https://openalex.org/W2534660133,"The limited cell dose in umbilical cord blood (UCB) necessitates ex vivo expansion of UCB. Further, the effective cryopreservation of these expanded cells is important in widening their use in the clinics. During cryopreservation, cells experience oxidative stress due to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Conditioned medium from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs-CM) has been shown to alleviate the oxidative stress during wound healing, Alzheimer's disease and ischemic disease. This premise prompted us to investigate the influence of MSCs-CM during cryopreservation of expanded UCB cells.CM-was collected from cord/placental MSCs(C-MSCs-CM, P-MSC-CM). UCB CD34+cells were expanded as suspension cultures in serum free medium containing cytokines for 10 days. Cells were frozen with/without C-MSCs-CM and or P-MSCs-CM in the conventional freezing medium containing 20%FCS +10%DMSO using a programmable freezer and stored in liquid nitrogen. Upon revival, cells frozen with MSCs-CM were found to be superior to cells frozen in conventional medium in terms of viability, CD34+content and clonogenecity. Priming of revived cells for 48 hrs with MSCs-CM further improved their transplantation ability, as compared to those cultured without MSCs-CM. P-MSCs-CM radically reduced the oxidative stress in cryopreserved cells, resulting in better post thaw functionality of CD34+ cells than with C-MSCs-CM. The observed cryoprotective effect of MSCs-CM was primarily due to anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic properties of the MSCs-CM and not because of the exosomes secreted by them.Our data suggest that MSCs-CM can serve as a valuable additive to the freezing or the priming medium for expanded UCB cells, which would increase their clinical applicability."
https://openalex.org/W2538728418,"Objectives Although betel quid (BQ) is an established risk factor of head and neck cancer (HNC), insufficiencies exist in the literature regarding the dose-response, BQ types, HNC sites, and BQ cessation. The current study was conducted to fill these insufficiencies. Materials and Methods A hospital-based case-control study was conducted to evaluate the association between BQ and HNC. In-person interview was conducted to collect data on BQ chewing. The current analysis included 487 men newly diagnosed with HNC and 617 male controls who were frequency-matched to the cases by age. The association between BQ and HNC was assessed using multivariable unconditional logistic regression. Results Ever BQ chewing was associated with an increased HNC risk regardless of the BQ types. A non-linear positive association between BQ and HNC was observed, with a steep rise in HNC risk for the first 5 pack-years or 200,000 minutes of BQ consumption. Every year of BQ cessation was associated with a 2.9% reduction in HNC risk; however, the risk did not reduce to the level of non-BQ chewers even after 20 years of BQ cessation. Eliminating BQ chewing may prevent 51.6% of HNCs, 62.6% of oral cancers, and 41.3% of pharyngeal cancers in Taiwan. Conclusion Our results supported the positive association between BQ and HNC. BQ cessation is effective in reducing HNC risk and should be encouraged. Because BQ cessation may not reduce the HNC risk to the level of non-BQ chewers, it is important to prevent the initiation of BQ chewing."
https://openalex.org/W2538370729,"The recently launched Brazilian ""forest certificates"" market is expected to reduce environmental compliance costs for landowners through an offset mechanism, after a long history of conservation laws based in command-and-control and strict rules. In this paper we assessed potential costs and evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the instrument when introducing to this market constraints that aim to address conservation objectives more specifically. Using the conservation planning software Marxan with Zones we simulated different scopes for the ""forest certificates"" market, and compared their cost-effectiveness with that of existing command-and-control (C&C), i.e. compliance to the Legal Reserve on own property, in the state of São Paulo. The simulations showed a clear potential of the constrained ""forest certificates"" market to improve conservation effectiveness and increase cost-effectiveness on allocation of Legal Reserves. Although the inclusion of an additional constraint of targeting the BIOTA Conservation Priority Areas doubled the cost (+95%) compared with a ""free trade"" scenario constrained only by biome, this option was still 50% less costly than the baseline scenario of compliance with Legal Reserve at the property."

The creatinine index (CI) has been validated as a reliable method to estimate LBM and evaluate the protein-energy status of HD patients. However, the traditional creatinine index formula was complex. We sought to investigate the impact of CI derived from a new simple formula on Chinese HD patient outcomes.In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled 1269 patients who initiated HD between February 1981 and February 2012 and followed them until the end of February 2013. CI was calculated using the simple creatinine kinetic model (CKM) formula. Multiple linear regression analysis and Cox regression proportional hazard analysis were used to define independent variables and compare survival between groups.The 1269 HD patients were categorized into 3 groups according to the tertiles of calculated CI between men and women. Each group consisted of 423 patients (50.6% men, 49.4% women). Patients in the highest sex-specific tertile of CI had longer overall survival (HR, 0.46; P 0.002). BMI did not significantly associate with survival after adjustment (HR,0.99; P 0.613).CI derived from the simple CKM formula serves as a good parameter than BMI to predict the survival of HD patients. The formula could extend its convenient use in clinical practice for HD patients."

https://openalex.org/W2534295808,"Deregulated receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling is frequently associated with tumorigenesis and therapy resistance, but its underlying mechanisms still need to be elucidated. In this study, we have shown that the RTK human epidermal growth factor receptor 4 (Her4, also known as Erbb4) can inhibit the tumor suppressor p53 by regulating MDMX-mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) complex stability. Upon activation by either overexpression of a constitutively active vector or ligand binding (Neuregulin-1), Her4 was able to stabilize the MDMX-MDM2 complex, resulting in suppression of p53 transcriptional activity, as shown by p53-responsive element-driven luciferase assay and mRNA levels of p53 target genes. Using a phospho-proteomics approach, we functionally identified a novel Her4-induced posttranslational modification on MDMX at Ser-314, a putative phosphorylation site for the CDK4/6 kinase. Remarkably, inhibition of Ser-314 phosphorylation either with Ser-to-Ala substitution or with a specific inhibitor of CDK4/6 kinase blocked Her4-induced stabilization of MDMX-MDM2 and rescued p53 activity. Our study offers insights into the mechanisms of deregulated RTK-induced carcinogenesis and provides the basis for the use of inhibitors targeting RTK-mediated signals for p53 restoration."
https://openalex.org/W2534892716,"Genome-wide association studies and candidate gene studies have identified several genetic variants that increase glioma risk. The majority of these variants are non-coding and the mechanisms behind the increased risk in carriers are not known. In this study, we hypothesize that some of the established glioma risk variants induce aberrant DNA methylation in the developing tumor, either locally (gene-specific) or globally (genome-wide). In a pilot data set including 77 glioma patients, we used Illumina beadchip technology to analyze genetic variants in blood and DNA methylation in matched tumor samples. To validate our findings, we used data from the Cancer Genome Atlas, including 401 glioblastoma patients. Consensus clustering identified the glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (gCIMP) and two additional subgroups with distinct patterns of global DNA methylation. In the pilot dataset, gCIMP was associated with two genetic variants in CDKN2B-AS1, rs1412829 and rs4977756 (9p21.3, p = 8.1 x 10−7 and 4.8 x 10−5, respectively). The association was in the same direction in the TCGA dataset, although statistically significant only when combining individuals with AG and GG genotypes. We also investigated the relation between glioma risk variants and DNA methylation in the promoter region of genes located within 30 kb of each variant. One association in the pilot dataset, between the TERT risk variant rs2736100 and lower methylation of cg23827991 (in TERT; p = 0.001), was confirmed in the TCGA dataset (p = 0.001). In conclusion, we found an association between rs1412829 and rs4977756 (9p21.3, CDKN2B-AS1) and global DNA methylation pattern in glioma, for which a trend was seen also in the TCGA glioblastoma dataset. We also found an association between rs2736100 (in TERT) and levels of methylation at cg23827991 (localized in the same gene, 3.3 kbp downstream of the risk variant), which was validated in the TCGA dataset. Except for this one association, we did not find strong evidence for gene-specific DNA methylation mediated by glioma risk variants."
https://openalex.org/W2535242794,"Chronic kidney disease is becoming a global public health problem, which will usually cause uremia at the end stage of chronic kidney failure. So far, kidney transplant is the most effective and proper therapy for uremia, however, the short supply of matched donor kidney has been a persistent bottleneck for transplantation. HLA matching of HLA-A, -B and -DRB1 loci is very important for the allocation of kidney transplants. In this study, we investigated genotypes of HLA-A, -B and -DRB1 loci based on 1,464 uremia patients and 10,000 unrelated healthy individuals in Henan province of China, and compared the frequency distribution of these HLA alleles and corresponding haplotypes between patient and healthy groups. We detected 23 HLA-A, 49 HLA-B and 17 HLA-DRB1 alleles in total. The predominant alleles of HLA-A, -B and -DRB1 loci in patients are the same as those in healthy group. The seven most frequent alleles account for about 87%, 50%, and 77% at HLA-A, -B and -DRB1 loci, respectively. The haplotypes (combinations of HLA-A, -B, and -DRB1) with significantly different frequency between patients and controls mostly account for less than 1%. Overall, this suggests that HLA matching is not a potential difficulty for kidney transplant of uremia patients. However, three of the top seven frequent HLA-DRB1 alleles have a significantly different distribution in patients and controls, while only one alleles for HLA-B and zero for HLA-A loci. These HLA-DRB1 alleles may be closely associated with uremia. This study sheds new lights on the composition and difference of HLA genotypes in uremia patients and healthy populations in Central China that can serve as a guide to HLA matching for kidney transplants and a resource for HLA typing-related studies."

This study aims to integrate QR (Quick Response) code with quality data and mobile intelligent technology to develop a convenient query terminal for tracing quality in the whole industrial chain of TCM (traditional Chinese medicine). Three herbal medicines were randomly selected and their chemical two-dimensional barcode (2D) barcodes fingerprints were constructed. Smartphone application (APP) based on Android system was developed to read initial data of 2D chemical barcodes, and compared multiple fingerprints from different batches of same species or different species. It was demonstrated that there were no significant differences between original and scanned TCM chemical fingerprints. Meanwhile, different TCM chemical fingerprint QR codes could be rendered in the same coordinate and showed the differences very intuitively. To be able to distinguish the variations of chemical fingerprint more directly, linear interpolation angle cosine similarity algorithm (LIACSA) was proposed to get similarity ratio. This study showed that QR codes can be used as an effective information carrier to transfer quality data. Smartphone application can rapidly read quality information in QR codes and convert data into TCM chemical fingerprints."

The artificial reef effect is important when planning offshore installations since it can create habitat enhancement. Wind power is the most advanced technology within offshore renewable energy sources and there is an urgent need to study its impacts on the marine environment. To test the hypothesis that offshore wind power increases the abundance of reef species relative to a reference area, we conduct an experiment on the model species common shore crab (Carcinus maenas).Overall, 3962 crabs were captured, observed, marked and released in 2011 and 1995 crabs in 2012. Additionally, carapace size, sex distribution, color morphs and body condition was recorded from captured crabs. We observed very low recapture rates at all sites during both years which made evaluating differences in population sizes very difficult. However, we were able to estimate population densities from the capture record for all three sites. There was no obvious artificial reef effect in the Lillgrund wind farm, but a spill-over effect to nearby habitats cannot be excluded. We could not find any effect of the wind farm on either, morphs, sex distribution or condition of the common shore crab. Our study found no evidence that Lillgrund wind farm has a negative effect on populations of the common shore crab. This study provides the first quantitative and experimental data on the common shore crab in relation to offshore wind farms."

Correctly measuring the half-life of a given drug is helpful for the safe and accurate usage of the drug. In this study, we investigated which gene ontology (GO) terms and biological pathways were highly related to the determination of drug half-life. The investigated drugs, with known half-lives, were analyzed based on their enrichment scores for associated GO terms and KEGG pathways. These scores indicate which GO terms or KEGG pathways the drug targets. The feature selection method, minimum redundancy maximum relevance, was used to analyze these GO terms and KEGG pathways and to identify important GO terms and pathways, such as sodium-independent organic anion transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0015347), monoamine transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0008504), negative regulation of synaptic transmission (GO:0050805), neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction (hsa04080), serotonergic synapse (hsa04726), and linoleic acid metabolism (hsa00591), among others.

https://openalex.org/W2534663632,"The balsam woolly adelgid (Adelges piceae (Ratzeburg) (Homoptera: Adelgidae)) (BWA) is a nonnative, invasive insect that threatens Abies species throughout North America. It is well established in the Pacific Northwest, but continues to move eastward through Idaho and into Montana and potentially threatens subalpine fir to the south in the central and southern Rocky Mountains. We developed a climatic risk model and map that predicts BWA impacts to subalpine fir using a two-step process. Using 30-year monthly climate normals from sites with quantitatively derived BWA damage severity index values, we built a regression model that significantly explained insect damage. The sites were grouped into two distinct damage categories (high damage and mortality versus little or no mortality and low damage) and the model estimates for each group were used to designate distinct value ranges for four climatic risk categories: minimal, low, moderate, and high. We then calculated model estimates for each cell of a 4-kilometer resolution climate raster and mapped the risk categories over the entire range of subalpine fir in the western United States. The spatial variation of risk classes indicates a gradient of climatic susceptibility generally decreasing from the Olympic Peninsula in Washington and the Cascade Range in Oregon and Washington moving eastward, with the exception of some high risk areas in northern Idaho and western Montana. There is also a pattern of decreasing climatic susceptibility from north to south in the Rocky Mountains. Our study provides an initial step for modeling the relationship between climate and BWA damage severity across the range of subalpine fir. We showed that September minimum temperature and a metric calculated as the maximum May temperature divided by total May precipitation were the best climatic predictors of BWA severity. Although winter cold temperatures and summer heat have been shown to influence BWA impacts in other locations, these variables were not as predictive as spring and fall conditions in the Pacific Northwest."
https://openalex.org/W2536898949,"Defects in neutrophil function have been implicated in a wide spectrum of clinical conditions. Several models are employed to study activated human neutrophils akin to those found at a site of inflammation. These include whole blood (WB) ex vivo stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and in vivo techniques: cantharidin blister, skin windows and intra-dermal injection of UV-killed E.coli (UVKEc). Neutrophils obtained from these have never been compared. We compared the activation status of neutrophils from each technique in order to inform the optimal model for use in human studies. Healthy male volunteers were randomised to undergo one of the four techniques (n = 5/group). LPS: WB stimulated with 1ng/ml of LPS for 4 hours. Cantharidin: 12.5μl of 0.1% cantharidin elicited a single blister, aspirated at 24 hours. Skin windows: four 6mm mechanical-suction blisters created, de-roofed and an exudate-collection chamber placed over the windows for 4 hours before aspiration. UVKEc: 1.5 x 107 UVKEc injected intra-dermally. A single 10mm mechanical-suction blister formed and aspirated at 4 hours. Unstimulated WB used as the control. Flow cytometry was used to determine activation status using CD16, CD11b, CD54, CD62L and CD88. Functional status was assessed with a phagocytosis assay. The pattern of neutrophil activation was similar in all models. Neutrophil CD11b was elevated in all models, most markedly in UVKEc (p<0.0001), and CD54 was also elevated but only significant in the LPS model (p = 0.001). CD62L was significantly reduced in all 4 models (p<0.0001) and CD88 was also suppressed in all. There were no changes in CD16 in any model, neither was there any significant difference in the phagocytic capacity of the neutrophils. In summary, there are no significant differences in activation marker expression or phagocytic capacity in the neutrophils obtained from each technique. Therefore we believe whole blood stimulation is the best model in experimentally challenging inpatient populations."

Therefore, it is important to monitor the genetic diversity in commercial germplasms as breeding practices, registration and marketing of new cultivars can lead to a significant reduction of the genetic diversity. Reduced genetic variation may lead to crop vulnerabilities, food insecurity and limited genetic gains following selection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genetic vulnerability risk by examining the relationship between the commercial Brazilian maize germplasms and the Nested Association Mapping (NAM) Parents. For this purpose, we used the commercial hybrids with the largest market share in Brazil and the NAM parents. The hybrids were genotyped for 768 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), using the Illumina Goldengate® platform. The NAM parent genomic data, comprising 1,536 SNPs for each line, were obtained from the Panzea data bank. The population structure, genetic diversity and the correlation between allele frequencies were analyzed. Based on the estimated effective population size and genetic variability, it was found that there is a low risk of genetic vulnerability in the commercial Brazilian maize germplasms. However, the genetic diversity is lower than those found in the NAM parents. Furthermore, the Brazilian germplasms presented no close relations with most NAM parents, except B73. This indicates that B73, or its heterotic group (Iowa Stiff Stalk Synthetic), contributed to the development of the commercial Brazilian germplasms."
https://openalex.org/W2538657028,"The fast development of high throughput genotyping has opened up new possibilities in genetics while at the same time producing considerable data handling issues. TheSNPpit is a database system for managing large amounts of multi panel SNP genotype data from any genotyping platform. With an increasing rate of genotyping in areas like animal and plant breeding as well as human genetics, already now hundreds of thousand of individuals need to be managed. While the common database design with one row per SNP can manage hundreds of samples this approach becomes progressively slower as the size of the data sets increase until it finally fails completely once tens or even hundreds of thousands of individuals need to be managed. TheSNPpit has implemented three ideas to also accomodate such large scale experiments: highly compressed vector storage in a relational database, set based data manipulation, and a very fast export written in C with Perl as the base for the framework and PostgreSQL as the database backend. Its novel subset system allows the creation of named subsets based on the filtering of SNP (based on major allele frequency, no-calls, and chromosomes) and manually applied sample and SNP lists at negligible storage costs, thus avoiding the issue of proliferating file copies. The named subsets are exported for down stream analysis. PLINK ped and map files are processed as in- and outputs. TheSNPpit allows management of different panel sizes in the same population of individuals when higher density panels replace previous lower density versions as it occurs in animal and plant breeding programs. A completely generalized procedure allows storage of phenotypes. TheSNPpit only occupies 2 bits for storing a single SNP implying a capacity of 4 mio SNPs per 1MB of disk storage. To investigate performance scaling, a database with more than 18.5 mio samples has been created with 3.4 trillion SNPs from 12 panels ranging from 1000 through 20 mio SNPs resulting in a database of 850GB. The import and export performance scales linearly with the number of SNPs and is largely independent of panel and database size. Import speed is around 6 mio SNPs/sec, export between 60 and 120 mio SNPs/sec. Being command line based, imports and exports can easily be integrated into pipelines. TheSNPpit is available under the Open Source GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2."
https://openalex.org/W2532365619,"Background Interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-23 are heterodimers that share the p40 subunit, and both cytokines are critical in the differentiation of T helper (Th)1 and Th17 cells, respectively. Th1 and Th17 effector cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), an animal model of the human central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune demyelinating disorder multiple sclerosis (MS). However, ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against p40 failed to show efficacy over placebo in a phase II clinical trial in patients with MS. The role of p40 in initial T cell priming and maintenance in secondary lymphoid tissues is not yet well understood. Methods Active EAE was induced in the B6.129-IL12b strain of p40eYFP reporter mice (yet40 mice), and Th1 and Th17 polarized cells were adoptively transferred into p40-deficient mice. Cellular subsets were phenotyped by multi-parameter flow cytometry, and p40 tissue expression was identified by confocal microscopy. Results We show that yet40 mice are susceptible to EAE, and that p40 is highly expressed in secondary lymphoid organs and the CNS during all stages of the disease. Interestingly, p40 expression in the recipient is not required for EAE induction after adoptive transfer of activated and differentiated encephalitogenic Th1 and Th17 cells into p40-deficient mice. Peripheral antagonism of T helper cell trophic factors critical for the differentiation and maintenance of Th1 and Th17 cells ameliorates EAE, indicating that p40 may play a critical role in the induction of CNS autoimmunity but not in its perpetuation. Conclusion Our data may explain why ustekinumab did not ameliorate paraclinical and clinical disease in patients with MS. In patients with already established disease, activated antigen-specific encephalitogenic CD4+ T cells are likely already differentiated, and are not dependent on p40 for maintenance. A clinical trial of longer duration with anti-p40 mAbs or other forms of pharmacological p40 antagonism, or sequential anti-p40 therapy following T cell depletion may show a benefit by affecting de novo generation of autoimmune T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2536095997,"The membrane proteins acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) are essential actors for triglycerides (TG) biosynthesis in eukaryotic organisms. Microbial production of TG is of interest for producing biofuel and value-added novel oils. In the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, Dga1p enzyme from the DGAT2 family plays a major role in TG biosynthesis. Producing recombinant DGAT enzymes pure and catalytically active is difficult, hampering their detailed functional characterization. In this report, we expressed in Escherichia coli and purified two soluble and active forms of Y. lipolytica Dga1p as fusion proteins: the first one lacking the N-terminal hydrophilic segment (Dga1pΔ19), the second one also devoid of the N-terminal putative transmembrane domain (Dga1pΔ85). Most DGAT assays are performed on membrane fractions or microsomes, using radiolabeled substrates. We implemented a fluorescent assay in order to decipher the substrate specificity of purified Dga1p enzymes. Both enzyme versions prefer acyl-CoA saturated substrates to unsaturated ones. Dga1pΔ85 preferentially uses long-chain saturated substrates. Dga1p activities are inhibited by niacin, a specific DGAT2 inhibitor. The N-terminal transmembrane domain appears important, but not essential, for TG biosynthesis. The soluble and active proteins described here could be useful tools for future functional and structural studies in order to better understand and optimize DGAT enzymes for biotechnological applications."

https://openalex.org/W2538666168,"Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) have attracted considerable attention due to their critically endangered status and related conservation issues, but their trophic relationships and ecological significance in coastal ecosystems are poorly understood. For instance, this species is noticeably more abundant in the Xin-Huwei River Estuary (Ex) of Western Taiwan than in the nearby Zhuoshui River Estuary (Ez), though it is unclear why the distribution shows such partitioning. To explore this topic, we conducted field surveys seasonally for two years from 2012 to 2013 and constructed Ecopath models of Ex, Ez, and an offshore site (Dm) to compare energy flow within the food webs. Model comparisons showed that the availability of food resources was the main factor influencing the biomass of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins. Specifically, its more frequent occurrence in Ex can be attributed to greater phytoplankton production and greater biomasses of macroinvertebrates and prey fish than in the other two areas. An increase in fishing activity might decrease the food availability and, consequently, the biomass of the dolphins. Although the decline in the dolphin population would increase the biomass of some prey fish species, local fishermen might not necessarily benefit from the decline due to the concurrent decrease of highly valued crabs and shrimp. Collectively, our work suggests that the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin is a keystone species in tropical coastal waters of Taiwan, and thereby exhibit a disproportional large ecological impact given their relatively low abundance."

The study was designed as a two-armed parallel cluster randomised controlled trial and the study population comprised adolescent students (aged 12-14 years, n = 1,565) who were recruited from 19 middle schools in Japan. The PADOK intervention or usual school programme was provided in schools to all eligible participants. The primary outcome was the SPS score at 6 months, while secondary outcomes included lifestyle factors, BMI, and dietary intakes. Analyses were undertaken on an intention to treat (ITT) basis accounting for the clustered design. Nineteen schools were randomised to the PADOK group (10 schools) and control group (9 schools). The numbers of students used for analysis were 1,509 for ITT and 1,420 (94.1%) for PPS. At 6 months, the crude mean change from baseline of the SPS scores by ITT analysis showed a significantly greater reduction in the PADOK group compared to that in the control group (-0.95, 95% CI -1.70 to -0.20, P = 0.016), while those for baseline-adjusted and multivariate-adjusted values showed similar directionality but were not significant (P = 0.063 and P = 0.130).

High-density epicardial mapping along with mathematical model were used to explore the link between local dyssynchrony and properties of wave conduction. High-density mapping showed a positive correlation between the dyssynchrony and number of fibrillatory waves (R2 = 0.68, p<0.001). In the mathematical model, virtual ablation at high dyssynchrony regions resulted in conduction regularization. The clinical study consisted of eighteen patients undergoing catheter ablation of persistent AF. High-density maps of left atrial (LA) were constructed using a circular mapping catheter. After pulmonary vein isolation, regions with the top 10% of the highest dyssynchrony in LA were targeted during ablation and followed with ablation of complex atrial electrograms. Catheter ablation resulted in termination during ablation at high dyssynchrony regions in 7 (41%) patients. In another 4 (24%) patients, transient organization was observed. In 6 (35%) there was no clear effect. Long-term follow-up showed 65% AF freedom at 1 year and 22% at 2 years. Conclusions Local electrical dyssynchrony provides a reasonable estimator of regional AF complexity defined as the number of fibrillatory waves. Additionally, it points to regions of dynamical instability related with action potential alternans. However, despite those characteristics, its utility in guiding catheter ablation of AF is limited suggesting other factors are responsible for AF persistence."

An ideal indicator should be pervasive, play a relevant role in the ecosystem, show a rapid and proportional answer to external perturbations and be easily and economically measurable. Rhizobacteria play a major role in determining soil properties, becoming an attractive candidate for the detection of ecological indicators. The application of massive sequencing technologies to metagenomic analysis is providing an increasingly more precise view of the structure and composition of soil communities. In this work, we analyse soil rhizobacterial composition under various stress levels to search for potential ecological indicators. General Biodiversity Indicators Our results suggest that the Shannon index requires observation of a relatively large number of individuals to be representative of the true population diversity, and that the Simpson index may underestimate rare taxa in rhizobacterial environments. Taxonomical Classification Methods Detection of indicator taxa requires comparison of taxonomical classification of sequences. We have compared RDP classifier, RTAX and similarity-based taxonomical classification and selected the latter for taxonomical assignment because it provides larger detail. Taxonomy-Based Ecological Indicators The study of significant variations in common, clearly identified, taxa, using paired datasets allows minimization of non-treatment effects and avoidance of false positives. We have identified taxa associated to specific perturbations as well as taxa generally affected in treated soils. Changes in these taxa, or combinations of them, may be used as ecological indicators of soil health. The overall number and magnitude of changes detected in taxonomic groups does also increase with stress. These changes constitute an alternative indicator to measuring specific taxa, although their determination requires large sample sizes, better obtained by massive sequencing. Summary The main ecological indicators available are the Shannon index, OTU counts and estimators, overall detection of the number and proportion of changes, and changes of specific indicator taxa. Massive sequencing remains the most accurate tool to measure rhizobacterial ecological indicators. When massive sequencing is not an option, various cultivable taxonomic groups, such as specific groups in the Actinobacteria tree, are attractive as potential indicators of large disruptions to the rhizobiome."
https://openalex.org/W2536627947,"Return to work (RTW) for people with acquired brain injury (ABI) represents a main objective of rehabilitation: this work presents a strong correlation between personal well-being and quality of life. The aim of this study is to investigate the prognostic factors that can predict RTW after ABI (traumatic or non- traumatic aetiology) in patients without disorders of consciousness (e.g. coma, vegetative or minimally conscious state) at the beginning of their admission to rehabilitation. At the end of a 6-month follow-up after discharge, data were successfully collected in 69 patients. The rehabilitation effectiveness (functional Recovery) between admission and discharge was assessed by Functional Independent Measure (FIM) gain, through the Montebello Rehabilitation Factor Score (MRFS), which was obtained as follows: (discharge FIM—admission FIM)/(Maximum possible FIM—Admission FIM) x 100. The cut-off value (criterion) deriving from MRFS, which helped identify RTW patients, resulted in .659 (sn 88.9%; sp 52.4%). Considering the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the MRFS data, the multivariable binary logistic regression analysis presented 62.96% of correct RTW classification cases, 80.95% of non-RTW leading to an overall satisfactory predictability of 73.91%. The results of the present study suggest that occupational therapy intervention could modify cut-off in patients with an MFRS close to target at the end of an in-hospital rehabilitative program thus developing their capabilities and consequently surpassing cut-off itself."
https://openalex.org/W2536305635,"Many different DNA delivery vehicles have been developed and tested, all with their advantages and disadvantages. The bacteriophage phi29 terminal protein (TP) is covalently linked to the 5’ ends of the phage genome during the DNA replication process. Our approach is to utilize this TP as a platform to incorporate different protein or peptide modules that can target the DNA to the interior of the cell, to the nucleus, or even to subcellular compartments. In order to be able to insert different peptide modules on the TP sequence to endow it with desired functions and/or eliminate unwanted regions of the protein, we have carried out a transposition screening to detect insertion-permissive points on the sequence of the TP. We report the functional characterization of 12 insertion mutants of the TP, and the identification of one site at position 38 that allows the insertion of peptides up to 17 amino acids in length while maintaining the ability of the TP to support DNA amplification in vitro. A protein with one insertion at that position containing a cysteine residue, a linker, and a thrombin recognition site was purified and its amplification activity was optimized."
