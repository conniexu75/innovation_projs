However, their application has been severely hindered by the need to cool them to extremely low temperature using liquid helium. Guo et al. now report a dysprosium compound that manifests magnetic hysteresis at temperatures up to 80 kelvin. The principles applied to tuning the ligands in this complex could point the way toward future architectures with even higher temperature performance. Science , this issue p. 1400"

About 25% of cells in normal, sun-exposed skin harbor cancer driver mutations. What about tissues not exposed to powerful mutagens like ultraviolet light? Martincorena et al. performed targeted gene sequencing of normal esophageal epithelium from nine human donors of varying age (see the Perspective by Chanock). The mutation rate was lower in esophagus than in skin, but there was a strong positive selection of clones carrying mutations in 14 cancer-associated genes. By middle age, more than half of the esophageal epithelium was colonized by mutant clones. Interestingly, mutations in the cancer driver gene NOTCH1 were more common in normal esophageal epithelium than in esophageal cancer. Science , this issue p. 911 ; see also p. 893"
https://openalex.org/W2898068898,"Dietary soluble fibers are fermented by gut bacteria into short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), which are considered broadly health-promoting. Accordingly, consumption of such fibers ameliorates metabolic syndrome. However, incorporating soluble fiber inulin, but not insoluble fiber, into a compositionally defined diet, induced icteric hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Such HCC was microbiota-dependent and observed in multiple strains of dysbiotic mice but not in germ-free nor antibiotics-treated mice. Furthermore, consumption of an inulin-enriched high-fat diet induced both dysbiosis and HCC in wild-type (WT) mice. Inulin-induced HCC progressed via early onset of cholestasis, hepatocyte death, followed by neutrophilic inflammation in liver. Pharmacologic inhibition of fermentation or depletion of fermenting bacteria markedly reduced intestinal SCFA and prevented HCC. Intervening with cholestyramine to prevent reabsorption of bile acids also conferred protection against such HCC. Thus, its benefits notwithstanding, enrichment of foods with fermentable fiber should be approached with great caution as it may increase risk of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2897488733,"Carbon–carbon bonds, including those between sp3-hybridized carbon atoms (alkyl–alkyl bonds), typically comprise much of the framework of organic molecules. In the case of sp3-hybridized carbon, the carbon can be stereogenic and the particular stereochemistry can have implications for structure and function1–3. As a consequence, the development of methods that simultaneously construct alkyl–alkyl bonds and control stereochemistry is important, although challenging. Here we describe a strategy for enantioselective alkyl–alkyl bond formation, in which a racemic alkyl electrophile is coupled with an olefin in the presence of a hydrosilane, rather than via a traditional electrophile–nucleophile cross-coupling, through the action of a chiral nickel catalyst. We demonstrate that families of racemic alkyl halides—including secondary and tertiary electrophiles, which have not previously been shown to be suitable for enantioconvergent coupling with alkyl metal nucleophiles—cross-couple with olefins with good enantioselectivity and yield under very mild reaction conditions. Given the ready availability of olefins, our approach opens the door to developing more general methods for enantioconvergent alkyl–alkyl coupling. Nickel-catalysed coupling of racemic alkyl electrophiles and olefins in the presence of a hydrosilane is achieved with good enantioselectivity and yield under very mild reaction conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2897058286,"The biophysical features of neurons shape information processing in the brain. Cortical neurons are larger in humans than in other species, but it is unclear how their size affects synaptic integration. Here, we perform direct electrical recordings from human dendrites and report enhanced electrical compartmentalization in layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Compared to rat dendrites, distal human dendrites provide limited excitation to the soma, even in the presence of dendritic spikes. Human somas also exhibit less bursting due to reduced recruitment of dendritic electrogenesis. Finally, we find that decreased ion channel densities result in higher input resistance and underlie the lower coupling of human dendrites. We conclude that the increased length of human neurons alters their input-output properties, which will impact cortical computation. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W2897025166,"Loss of PTEN, the major negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway induces a cellular senescence as a failsafe mechanism to defend against tumorigenesis, which is called PTEN-loss-induced cellular senescence (PICS). Although many studies have indicated that the mTOR pathway plays a critical role in cellular senescence, the exact functions of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in PICS are not well understood. In this study, we show that mTOR acts as a critical relay molecule downstream of PI3K/AKT and upstream of p53 in PICS. We found that PTEN depletion induces cellular senescence via p53-p21 signaling without triggering DNA damage response. mTOR kinase, a major component of mTORC1 and mTORC2, directly binds p53 and phosphorylates it at serine 15. mTORC1 and mTORC2 compete with MDM2 and increase the stability of p53 to induce cellular senescence via accumulation of the cell cycle inhibitor, p21. In embryonic fibroblasts of PTEN-knockout mice, PTEN deficiency also induces mTORC1 and mTORC2 to bind to p53 instead of MDM2, leading to cellular senescence. These results collectively demonstrate for the first time that mTOR plays a critical role in switching cells from proliferation signaling to senescence signaling via a direct link between the growth-promoting activity of AKT and the growth-suppressing activity of p53."
https://openalex.org/W2738316236,"Previous studies have reported that anal cancer incidence has increased in individual countries; however, age-specific trends were not examined in detail. This study describes pooled and country-specific anal cancer incidence trends by sex, age (all ages, <60 and 60+ years) and histological subtype (all subtypes, squamous cell carcinoma [SCC] and adenocarcinoma [ADC]).Five-year incidence and population-at-risk data were obtained from IARC's Cancer Incidence in Five Continents for the years 1988-1992 to 2008-2012. The standardised rate ratios (SRRs) for 2008-2012 vs 1988-1992 and the 5-year average percent change (AvPC) during the period were used to assess changes in the age-standardised incidence rates.During the study period, there were significant increases in the incidence of SCC in both men and women of all age groups with significant increasing trend, and these increases were highest in those aged <60 years (SRR = 2.34 [95% CI:2.11-2.58] in men and SRR = 2.76 [95% CI:2.54-3.00] in women). By contrast, there were significant decreases in the incidence of ADC in men and women of all ages (SRR = 0.60 [95% CI:0.54-0.67]) and (SRR = 0.63 [95% CI:0.56-0.71], respectively), with similar decreases in those aged <60 years and 60+ years. These competing trends still resulted in significant increases in the overall incidence of anal cancer in men and women of all ages groups with significant increasing trend. The SRRs in men of all ages, <60 years and 60+ years were 1.35 (95% CI:1.28-1.42), 1.77 (95% CI:1.62-1.92) and 1.08 (95% CI:1.00-1.15), respectively. The corresponding SRRs in women were 1.75 (95% CI:1.67-1.83), 2.31 (95% CI:2.14-2.48) and 1.38 (95% CI 1.31-1.46), respectively.Increases in the incidence of anal SCC has driven an overall increase in anal cancer incidence; this may be associated with changing sexual behaviours and increasing levels of HPV exposure in younger cohorts. The findings further reinforce the importance of HPV vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W2896180549,"Warfarin dosing remains challenging due to narrow therapeutic index and highly individual variability. Incorrect warfarin dosing is associated with devastating adverse events. Remarkable efforts have been made to develop the machine learning based warfarin dosing algorithms incorporating clinical factors and genetic variants such as polymorphisms in CYP2C9 and VKORC1. The most widely validated pharmacogenetic algorithm is the IWPC algorithm based on multivariate linear regression (MLR). However, with only a single algorithm, the prediction performance may reach an upper limit even with optimal parameters. Here, we present novel algorithms using stacked generalization frameworks to estimate the warfarin dose, within which different types of machine learning algorithms function together through a meta-machine learning model to maximize the prediction accuracy. Compared to the IWPC-derived MLR algorithm, Stack 1 and 2 based on stacked generalization frameworks performed significantly better overall. Subgroup analysis revealed that the mean of the percentage of patients whose predicted dose of warfarin within 20% of the actual stable therapeutic dose (mean percentage within 20%) for Stack 1 was improved by 12.7% (from 42.47% to 47.86%) in Asians and by 13.5% (from 22.08% to 25.05%) in the low-dose group compared to that for MLR, respectively. These data suggest that our algorithms would especially benefit patients requiring low warfarin maintenance dose, as subtle changes in warfarin dose could lead to adverse clinical events (thrombosis or bleeding) in patients with low dose. Our study offers novel pharmacogenetic algorithms for clinical trials and practice."
https://openalex.org/W2897297488,"Intramuscular fat is considered a potential factor that is associated with meat quality in animal production and insulin resistance in humans. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of mRNA plays an important role in regulating adipogenesis. However, the effects of m6A on the adipogenesis of intramuscular preadipocytes and associated mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we performed m6A sequencing to compare m6A methylome of the longissimus dorsi muscles (LDMs) between Landrace pigs (lean-type breed) and Jinhua pigs (obese-type breed with higher levels of intramuscular fat). Transcriptome-wide m6A profiling of porcine LDMs was highly conserved with humans and mice. Furthermore, we identified a unique methylated gene in Jinhua pigs named mitochondrial carrier homology 2 (MTCH2). The m6A levels oiMTCHl mRNA were reduced by introducing a synonymous mutation, and adipogenesis test results showed that the MTCH2 mutant was inferior with regard to adipogenesis compared with the MTCH2 wild-type. We then found that MTCH2 protein expression was positively associated with m6A levels, and an YTH domain family protein 1-RNA immunoprecipitation-quantitative PCR assay indicated that MTCH2 mRNA was a target of the YTH domain family protein 1. This study provides comprehensive m6A profiles of LDM transcriptomes in pigs and suggests an essential role for m6A modification of MTCH2 in intramuscular fat regulation.—Jiang, Q., Sun, B., Liu, Q., Cai, M., Wu, R., Wang, F., Yao, Y., Wang, Y., Wang, X.

https://openalex.org/W2897300788,"Overlapping genes represent a fascinating evolutionary puzzle, since they encode two functionally unrelated proteins from the same DNA sequence. They originate by a mechanism of overprinting, in which point mutations in an existing frame allow the expression (the ""birth"") of a completely new protein from a second frame. In viruses, in which overlapping genes are abundant, these new proteins often play a critical role in infection, yet they are frequently overlooked during genome annotation. This results in erroneous interpretation of mutational studies and in a significant waste of resources. Therefore, overlapping genes need to be correctly detected, especially since they are now thought to be abundant also in eukaryotes. Developing better detection methods and conducting systematic evolutionary studies require a large, reliable benchmark dataset of known cases. We thus assembled a high-quality dataset of 80 viral overlapping genes whose expression is experimentally proven. Many of them were not present in databases. We found that overall, overlapping genes differ significantly from non-overlapping genes in their nucleotide and amino acid composition. In particular, the proteins they encode are enriched in high-degeneracy amino acids and depleted in low-degeneracy ones, which may alleviate the evolutionary constraints acting on overlapping genes. Principal component analysis revealed that the vast majority of overlapping genes follow a similar composition bias, despite their heterogeneity in length and function. Six proven mammalian overlapping genes also followed this bias. We propose that this apparently near-universal composition bias may either favour the birth of overlapping genes, or/and result from selection pressure acting on them."
https://openalex.org/W2897625725,"Background and objectives Latin American (LA) countries have begun to adopt a variety of regulations targeting sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) for public health reasons. Our objective was to characterize the regulatory strategies designed to reduce SSB consumption over the last decade, and assess the available evidence on their enforcement and impact. Methods We searched legal and public health databases for public and private SSBs regulations in 14 LA countries and then conducted a systematic review of the available literature. We tracked comparative variations in the type of body issuing the regulations, their scope, and binding status. We present data following a 5-category framework we named NUTRE that classifies SSBs regulations as: (1) restrictions to SSB availability in schools (N), (2) taxes and other economic incentives to discourage consumption (U), (3) restrictions on advertising and marketing (T), (4) regulations on government procurement and subsidies (R), and (5) product labeling rules (E). Results Since 2006, 14 LA countries have adopted at least 39 public and private SSB regulatory initiatives across the NUTRE framework. Comprehensive efforts have only been approved by Chile, México and Ecuador, while the rest have comparatively few initiatives. 28 out of the 39 regulatory initiatives were passed by legislative and executive bodies; 11 initiatives represent self-regulatory undertakings by the beverage industries. An 86% (24/28) of public sector regulations are binding; 56% (22/39) contain explicit monitoring or evaluation methods; and 62% (24/39) provide for sanctions. Moreover, 23 regulations specify the body in charge of monitoring the new rules and standards. Conclusions LA countries are targeting SSB consumption through a variety of mechanisms, particularly via restrictions to availability in schools and through taxes. Interdisciplinary evidence comparing alternative regulatory strategies is scarce, and few studies offer data on impact and implementation challenges. More evidence and further comparative assessments are needed to support future decision-making."
https://openalex.org/W2895794431,"The G2/M checkpoint inhibits mitotic entry upon DNA damage, thereby preventing segregation of broken chromosomes and preserving genome stability. The tumor suppressor proteins BRCA1, PALB2 and BRCA2 constitute a BRCA1–PALB2–BRCA2 axis that is essential for homologous recombination (HR)-based DNA doublestrand break repair. Besides HR, BRCA1 has been implicated in both the initial activation and the maintenance of the G2/M checkpoint, while BRCA2 and PALB2 have been shown to be critical for its maintenance. Here we show that all three proteins can play a significant role in both checkpoint activation and checkpoint maintenance, depending on cell type and context, and that PALB2 links BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the checkpoint response. The BRCA1–PALB2 interaction can be important for checkpoint activation, whereas the PALB2–BRCA2 complex formation appears to be more critical for checkpoint maintenance. Interestingly, the function of PALB2 in checkpoint response appears to be independent of CHK1 and CHK2 phosphorylation. Following ionizing radiation, cells with disengaged BRCA1–PALB2 interaction show greatly increased chromosomal abnormalities due apparently to combined defects in HR and checkpoint control. These findings provide new insights into DNA damage checkpoint control and further underscore the critical importance of the proper cooperation of the BRCA and PALB2 proteins in genome maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W2897922227,"Very preterm birth, before the gestational age (GA) of 32 weeks, increases the risk of obstructed airflow in adulthood. We examined whether all preterm births (GA<37 weeks) are associated with poorer adult lung function and whether any associations are explained by maternal, early life/neonatal, or current life factors. Participants of the ESTER Preterm Birth Study, born between 1985 and 1989 (during the pre-surfactant era), at the age of 23 years participated in a clinical study in which they performed spirometry and provided detailed medical history. Of the participants, 139 were born early preterm (GA<34 weeks), 239 late preterm (GA: 34-<37 weeks), and 341 full-term (GA≥37 weeks). Preterm birth was associated with poorer lung function. Mean differences between individuals born early preterm versus full-term were -0.23 standard deviation (SD) (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.40, -0.05)) for forced vital capacity z-score (zFVC), -0.44 SD (95% CI -0.64, -0.25) for forced expiratory volume z-score (zFEV1), and -0.29 SD (95% CI -0.47, -0.10) for zFEV1/FVC. For late preterm, mean differences with full-term controls were -0.02 SD (95% CI -0.17, 0.13), -0.12 SD (95% CI -0.29, 0.04) and -0.13 SD (95% CI -0.29, 0.02) for zFVC, zFEV1, and zFEV1/FVC, respectively. Examination of finer GA subgroups suggested an inverse non-linear association between lung function and GA, with the greatest impact on zFEV1 for those born extremely preterm. The subgroup means were GA<28 weeks: -0.98 SD; 28-<32 weeks: -0.29 SD; 32-<34 weeks: -0.44 SD; 34-<36 weeks: -0.10 SD; 36-<37weeks: -0.11 SD; term-born controls (≥37weeks): 0.02 SD. Corresponding means for zFEV1/FVC were -1.79, -0.44, -0.47, -0.48, -0.29, and -0.02. Adjustment for maternal pregnancy conditions and socioeconomic and lifestyle factors had no major impact on the relationship. Preterm birth is associated with airflow limitation in adult life. The association appears to be attributable predominantly to those born most immature, with only a modest decrease among those born preterm at later gestational ages."
https://openalex.org/W2896000771,"Development and maintenance of healthy stratified epithelia require the coordination of complex transcriptional programmes. The transcription factor p63, a member of the p53 family, plays a crucial role in epithelial development and homeostasis. Analysis of the p63-dependent transcriptome indicated that one important aspect of p63 functions in epithelial development is the regulation of cell–cell and cell–matrix adhesion programmes. However, limited knowledge exists on the relevant cell–cell adhesion molecules involved in physiological epithelial formation. Similarly, limited data are available to understand if deregulation of the cell–cell adhesion programme is important in tumour formation. Here, using the epidermis as an experimental model with the RNA sequencing approach, we identify a novel p63-regulated gene induced during differentiation, ZNF185. ZNF185 is an actin-cytoskeleton-associated Lin-l 1, Isl-1 and Mec-3 (LIM) domain-containing protein, whose function is poorly known. We found that p63 binds to a specific enhancer region, promoting its expression to sustain epithelial differentiation. ZNF185 silencing strongly impaired keratinocyte differentiation according to gene array analysis. ZNF185 is detected at the cell–cell periphery where it physically interacts with E-cadherin, indicating that it is important to maintain epithelial integrity beyond its pro-differentiation role. Interestingly, poorly differentiated, including head and neck, cervical and oesophageal, squamous cell carcinomas display loss of ZNF185 expression. Together, these studies reinforce that p63 is a crucial gene for maintaining epithelial tissue integrity and support the deregulation of the cell-cell adhesion programme,which plays a critical role in carcinoma development."
https://openalex.org/W2897121834,"Previous studies have shown that Japanese people exhibit a higher abundance of Bifidobacterium compared to people from other countries. Among the possible factors affecting the gut microbiota composition, an association of functional lactase gene variants with a higher abundance of Bifidobacterium in the gut has been proposed in some reports. However, no Japanese subjects were included in these studies. In this study, we investigated the possible contribution of functional lactase loci to the high abundance of Bifidobacterium in Japanese populations. Based on a data analysis assessing 1,068 healthy Japanese adults, a number of subjects is at least seven times greater than that reported in available online data. all subjects possessed CC genotype at rs4988235 and the GG at rs182549, which are associated with low lactase activity. We observed a positive correlation between dairy product intake and Bifidobacterium abundance in the gut. Considering previous reports, which revealed that four additional functional lactase loci, rs145946881, rs41380347, rs41525747 and rs869051967 (ss820486563), are also associated with low lactase activity in Japanese people, our findings imply the possible contribution of host genetic variation-associated low lactase activity to the high abundance of Bifidobacterium in the Japanese population."

https://openalex.org/W2897633617,"Background Regulating thermogenesis is a major task of thyroid hormones (THs), and involves TH-responsive energetic processes at the central and peripheral level. In severe obesity, little is known on the relationship between THs and resting energy expenditure (REE) before and after weight loss. Methods We enrolled 100 euthyroid subjects with severe obesity who were equally distributed between genders. Each was examined before and after completion of a 4-wk inpatient multidisciplinary dieting program and subjected to measurement of thyroid function, REE, fat-free mass (FFM, kg) and percent fat mass (FM). Results Baseline REE was lower than predicted in 70 obese patients, and overall associated with BMI, FFM and FM but not thyroid-related parameters. By the study end, both BMI and REE decreased (5.5% and 4.1%, p<0.001 vs. baseline) and their percent changes were significantly associated (p<0.05), while no association related percent changes of REE and FFM or FM. Individually, REE decreased in 66 and increased in 34 patients irrespective of gender, BMI and body composition. Weight loss significantly impacted TSH (-6.3%), FT3 (-3.3%) and FT4 levels (3.9%; p<0.001 for all). By the study end, a significant correlation became evident between REE and FT4 (r = 0.42, p<0.001) as well as FT3 (r = 0.24, p<0.05). In stepwise multivariable regression analysis, however, neither THs nor body composition entered the regression equation for REE response to weight loss. Conclusions In severe obesity, short-term weight loss discloses a positive relationship between REE and THs."
https://openalex.org/W2896047917,"The study of the fine-grained social dynamics between children is a methodological challenge, yet a good understanding of how social interaction between children unfolds is important not only to Developmental and Social Psychology, but recently has become relevant to the neighbouring field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Indeed, child-robot interactions are increasingly being explored in domains which require longer-term interactions, such as healthcare and education. For a robot to behave in an appropriate manner over longer time scales, its behaviours have to be contingent and meaningful to the unfolding relationship. Recognising, interpreting and generating sustained and engaging social behaviours is as such an important—and essentially, open—research question. We believe that the recent progress of machine learning opens new opportunities in terms of both analysis and synthesis of complex social dynamics. To support these approaches, we introduce in this article a novel, open dataset of child social interactions, designed with data-driven research methodologies in mind. Our data acquisition methodology relies on an engaging, methodologically sound, but purposefully underspecified free-play interaction. By doing so, we capture a rich set of behavioural patterns occurring in natural social interactions between children. The resulting dataset, called the PInSoRo dataset, comprises 45+ hours of hand-coded recordings of social interactions between 45 child-child pairs and 30 child-robot pairs. In addition to annotations of social constructs, the dataset includes fully calibrated video recordings, 3D recordings of the faces, skeletal informations, full audio recordings, as well as game interactions."

https://openalex.org/W2896259896,"Low expression and instability are significant challenges in the recombinant production of therapeutic peptides. The current study introduces a novel expression and purification system for human insulin production using the molecular chaperone αB-crystallin (αB-Cry) as a fusion partner protein. Insulin is composed of A- and B-chain containing three disulfide bonds (one intarchain and two interchains). We have constructed two plasmids harboring the A- or B-chain of insulin joined with human αB-Cry. This system is suitable for cloning of the genes and for directing the synthesis of large amounts of the fusion proteins αB-Cry/A-chain (αB-AC) and αB-Cry/B-chain (αB-BC). The construction of vectors, their efficient expression in Escherichia coli and simple purification of the fusion proteins and two insulin chains are described. A large amount of the recombinant fusion proteins with high purity was obtained by applying a single step anion exchange chromatography or metal chelate affinity. The insulin A- and B-chain were released from the fusion proteins using cyanogen bromide cleavage. The insulin peptides were obtained with an appreciable yield and high purity using one-step gel filtration chromatography. To increase efficiency of chain combination to produce insulin, αB-Cry was used under oxidative conditions. The purification of natively folded insulin was performed by phenyl sepharose hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Finally, using an insulin tolerance test in mice and various biophysical methods, the structure and function of purified human recombinant insulin was compared with authentic insulin, to verify folding of insulin to its native state. Overall, the novel expression system using αB-Cry is highly demanding for producing human insulin and functional protein. The procedure for αB-Cry-mediated insulin folding could be also applicable for the large-scale production of this highly important therapeutic peptide hormone."
https://openalex.org/W2897849508,"Rationale & objective As the prevalence of obesity continues to rise in the United States, it is important to understand its impact on the lifetime risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Study design The CKD Health Policy Model was used to simulate the lifetime risk of CKD for those with and without obesity at baseline. Model structure was updated for glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline to incorporate new longitudinal data from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) study. Setting and population The updated model was populated with a nationally representative cohort from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Outcomes Lifetime risk of CKD, highest stage and any stage. Model, perspective, & timeframe Simulation model following up individuals from current age through death or age 90 years. Results Lifetime risk of any CKD stage was 32.5% (95% CI 28.6%–36.3%) for persons with normal weight, 37.6% (95% CI 33.5%–41.7%) for persons who were overweight, and 41.0% (95% CI 36.7%–45.3%) for persons with obesity at baseline. The difference between persons with normal weight and persons with obesity at baseline was statistically significant (p<0.01). Lifetime risk of CKD stages 4 and 5 was higher for persons with obesity at baseline (Stage 4: 2.1%, 95% CI 0.9%–3.3%; stage 5: 0.6%, 95% CI 0.0%–1.1%), but the differences were not statistically significant (stage 4: p = 0.08; stage 5: p = 0.23). Limitations Due to limited data, our simulation model estimates are based on assumptions about the causal pathways from obesity to CKD, diabetes, and hypertension. Conclusions The results of this study indicate that obesity may have a large impact on the lifetime risk of CKD. This is important information for policymakers seeking to set priorities and targets for CKD prevention and treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2896209891,"This paper presents a lightweight synthesis algorithm, named adaptive region segmentation based piecewise linear (ARSPL) algorithm, for reconstructing standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from a 3-lead subset (I, II and V2). Such a lightweight algorithm is particularly suitable for healthcare mobile devices with limited resources for computing, communication and data storage. After detection of R-peaks, the ECGs are segmented by cardiac cycles. Each cycle is further divided into four regions according to different cardiac electrical activity stages. A personalized linear regression algorithm is then applied to these regions respectively for improved ECG synthesis. The proposed ARSPL method has been tested on 39 subjects randomly selected from the PTB diagnostic ECG database and achieved accurate synthesis of remaining leads with an average correlation coefficient of 0.947, an average root-mean-square error of 55.4μV, and an average runtime performance of 114ms. Overall, these results are significantly better than those of the common linear regression method, the back propagation (BP) neural network and the BP optimized using the genetic algorithm. We have also used the reconstructed ECG signals to evaluate the denivelation of ST segment, which is a potential symptom of intrinsic myocardial disease. After ARSPL, only 10.71% of the synthesized ECG cycles are with a ST-level synthesis error larger than 0.1mV, which is also better than those of the three above-mentioned methods."
https://openalex.org/W2896210678,"Hirudo nipponia (known as Shui Zhi in Chinese) is a well-known Chinese medicine with numerous active ingredients in its body, especially in its saliva. This native Chinese blood-sucking leech has been used for therapeutic purposes since before 100 AD. Modern Chinese physicians use it for a wide range of diseases. Genomic data and molecular information about the pharmacologically active substances produced by this medicinal leech are presently unavailable despite this organism's medicinal importance. In this study, we performed transcriptome profiling of the salivary glands of medicinal leech H. nipponia using the Illumina platform. In total, 84,657,362 clean reads were assembled into 50,535 unigenes. The obtained unigenes were compared to public databases. Furthermore, a unigene sequence similarity search and comparisons with the whole transcriptome of medical leech were performed to identify potential proteins. Finally, more than 21 genes were predicted to be involved in anticoagulatory, antithrombotic, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and antitumor processes, which might play important roles in the treatment of various diseases. This study is the first analysis of a sialotranscriptome in H. nipponia. The transcriptome profile will shed light on its genetic background and provide a useful tool to deepen our understanding of the medical value of H. nipponia."
https://openalex.org/W2896695914,"It is not fully clear which measurable factors can reliably predict chronic stroke patients’ recovery of motor ability. In this analysis, we investigate the impact of patient demographic characteristics, movement features, and a three-week upper-extremity intervention on the post-treatment change in two widely used clinical outcomes—the Upper Extremity portion of the Fugl-Meyer and the Wolf Motor Function Test. Models based on LASSO, which in validation tests account for 65% and 86% of the variability in Fugl-Meyer and Wolf, respectively, were used to identify the set of salient demographic and movement features. We found that age, affected limb, and several measures describing the patient’s ability to efficiently direct motions with a single burst of speed were the most consequential in predicting clinical recovery. On the other hand, the upper-extremity intervention was not a significant predictor of recovery. Beyond a simple prognostic tool, these results suggest that focusing therapy on the more important features is likely to improve recovery. Such validation-intensive methods are a novel approach to determining the relative importance of patient-specific metrics and may help guide the design of customized therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2896992430,"Manipulative actions involving unstable interactions with the environment require controlling mechanical impedance through muscle co-contraction. While much research has focused on how the central nervous system (CNS) selects the muscle patterns underlying a desired movement or end-point force, the coordination strategies used to achieve a desired end-point impedance have received considerably less attention. We recorded isometric forces at the hand and electromyographic (EMG) signals in subjects performing a reaching task with an external disturbance. In a virtual environment, subjects displaced a cursor by applying isometric forces and were instructed to reach targets in 20 spatial locations. The motion of the cursor was then perturbed by disturbances whose effects could be attenuated by increasing co-contraction. All subjects could voluntarily modulate co-contraction when disturbances of different magnitudes were applied. For most muscles, activation was modulated by target direction according to a cosine tuning function with an offset and an amplitude increasing with disturbance magnitude. Co-contraction was characterized by projecting the muscle activation vector onto the null space of the EMG-to-force mapping. Even in the baseline the magnitude of the null space projection was larger than the minimum magnitude required for non-negative muscle activations. Moreover, the increase in co-contraction was not obtained by scaling the baseline null space projection, scaling the difference between the null space projections in any block and the projection of the non-negative minimum-norm muscle vector, or scaling the difference between the null space projections in the perturbed blocks and the baseline null space projection. However, the null space projections in the perturbed blocks were obtained by linear combination of the baseline null space projection and the muscle activation used to increase co-contraction without generating any force. The failure of scaling rules in explaining voluntary modulation of arm co-contraction suggests that muscle pattern generation may be constrained by muscle synergies."
https://openalex.org/W2952147817,"Background Developmental exposure to perfluorinated alkylate substances (PFASs) is associated with deficient IgG antibody responses to childhood vaccines. As this immunotoxicity outcome may represent a critical effect, calculation of benchmark dose (BMD) results would be useful for defining protective limits of exposure. However, exposures to the major PFASs that are associated with this adverse effect are interrelated, and mutually adjusted BMD results would be desirable. Methods We carried out BMD calculations on prospective data from two prospective birth cohort studies from the Faroe Islands with a total of 1,146 children. Exposure data included serum concentrations of five major PFASs at birth and at age 5 years and, as outcome parameters, the serum concentrations of specific IgG antibodies against tetanus and diphtheria at ages 5 and 7. We calculated the BMDs and their lower confidence bounds (BMDLs) and included mutual adjustment for five major PFASs. BMD and BMDL were expressed in terms of the serum concentration of the PFASs. Results The BMDLs for the immunotoxicants were of similar magnitude before and after adjustment. As compared to linear dose-response models, the PFASs showed lower results for a piecewise linear model, which also provided a slightly better fit. Weaker associations with the antibody outcomes were observed after adjustments due to the correlation between the PFASs. However, while the adjustments resulted in elevated BMD results and p values, the BMDL values were not materially changed. Conclusions Adjustment for co-exposure to a related immunotoxicant increased both the BMD values and their standard errors, though affected the BMDL values only to a negligible extent. Thus, when correlated toxicants appear to affect the same outcome and none of them is known a priori to be solely responsible, all exposures may be considered responsible in BMD calculations. Our BMDL results, both before and after adjustment are generally below current exposure levels and therefore suggest that all five perfluorinated substances should attract regulatory attention, at least until additional evidence shows otherwise."
https://openalex.org/W2896011315,"Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype is believed to play a role in the onset of dementia, though less is known about its relationship with non-pathogenic age-related cognitive decline. We assessed whether APOE was a risk factor for cognitive decline among older Taiwanese adults using nationally representative data. General cognition was measured longitudinally over eleven years; domain-specific cognitive assessments of working memory, declarative learning and three aspects of attention (executive function, alerting, and orientation) were performed once. Having at least one risky APOE allele was associated with more rapid longitudinal cognitive decline compared to those with no risky alleles. Some evidence from the cross-sectional analysis of domain-specific cognitive assessments suggested that APOE genotype may be more closely associated with working memory and declarative learning than with attention. Most genetic studies of cognition include only populations of European descent; extension is crucial. This study confirmed the association between APOE genotype and the rate of cognitive decline in a predominantly Han Chinese population. Additional studies on diverse populations are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2896182858,"Glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) are long chains of repeating disaccharide units, covalently linked to core proteins to form proteoglycans. Proteoglycans can be cell membrane-bound or are part of the extracellular matrix. They are important in a wide range of biologic processes, including development, synaptic plasticity, and regeneration after injury, as well as modulation of growth factor signaling, cell migration, survival, and proliferation. Synthesis of CS and DS in the Golgi apparatus is mediated by sulfotransferases that modify sugar chains through transfer of sulfate groups to specific positions on the sugar moieties. To clarify the functions of CS and DS during nervous system regeneration, we studied the effect of chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase-1/carbohydrate sulfotransferase-11 (C4ST-l/Chst-11) and dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase-1/Chst-14 (D4ST-l/Chst-14) down-regulation on spinal cord regeneration in larval and adult zebrafish. In our study, knockdown of C4ST1/Chst-11 accelerated regeneration after spinal cord injury in larval and adult zebrafish and knockdown of D4ST1/Chst-14 did not alter regenerative capacity. From these and previous observations, we drew the conclusion that different CS and DS expression patterns can be growth permitting, growth inhibiting, or neutral for regrowing or sprouting axons, depending on the tissue environment of a particular animal species.—Sahu, S., Li, R., Loers, G., Schachner, M.

https://openalex.org/W2897133981,"Objectives To investigate the long-term postoperative outcomes and predictive factors associated with poor surgical outcomes in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Materials and methods We enrolled patients with MTLE who underwent resective surgery at single university-affiliated hospital. Surgical outcomes were determined using a modified Engel classification at the 2nd and 5th years after surgery and the last time of follow-up. Results The mean duration of follow-up after surgery was 7.6 ± 3.7 years (range, 5.0–21.0 years). 334 of 400 patients (83.5%) were seizure-free at the 5th postoperative year. Significant predictive factors of a poor outcome at the 5th year were a history of generalized tonic clonic (GTC) seizures (odds ratio, OR; 2.318), bi-temporal interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) (OR; 3.107), bilateral hippocampal sclerosis (HS) (OR; 5.471), unilateral HS and combined extra-hippocampal lesion (OR; 5.029), and bi-temporal hypometabolism (BTH) (OR; 4.438). Bi-temporal IED (hazard ratio, HR; 2.186), BTH (HR; 2.043), bilateral HS (HR; 2.541) and unilateral HS and combined extra-hippocampal lesion (HR; 2.75) were independently associated with seizure recurrence. We performed a subgroup analysis of 208 patients with unilateral HS, and their independent predictors of a poor outcome at the 5th year were BTH (OR; 5.838) and tailored hippocampal resection (OR; 11.053). Conclusion This study demonstrates that 16.5% of MTLE patients had poor long-term outcomes after surgery. Bilateral involvement in electrophysiological and imaging studies predicts poor surgical outcomes in MTLE patients."

A new class of HCV infections, Occult HCV infection (OCI), is defined as the presence of HCV-RNA in hepatocytes with the absence of HCV in the serum/plasma utilizing current laboratory assays. Different groups have reported the prevalence of OCI; however, its associated risk factors have not been established. In Mexico, there are no reports about OCI, so the objective of our study was to determine the prevalence of OCI in total blood donors in Mexico City, as well as its associated risk factors.Blood donors that were considered eligible for donation, according to NOM 253-SSA1-2012, were randomly selected. Demographic data was collected from 1,037 donors. Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells were assessed for HCV-RNA. The presence of HCV-RNA was determined by nested PCR for the 5'-UTR region. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) to determine the level of association.The prevalence of OCI was 3.4% among blood donors. Homosexual relationships (OR = 5.52, 95%CI: 1.53-19.92, p<0.05) and acupuncture (OR = 3.56, 95%CI: 1.41-8.98, p<0.05) were significantly associated with OCI.There is a significant presence of OCI in the blood donor population in Mexico City. The main risk factors for OCI transmission are homosexual relationships and acupuncture. This study supports the increased use of sensitive and specific screening tests for blood bank testing."
https://openalex.org/W2895817636,"Compared to individuals in lower positions of power, higher-power individuals are theorized to be less motivated to attend to social cues. In support of this theory, previous research has consistently documented negative correlations between social class and emotion perception. Prior studies, however, were limited by the size and diversity of the participant samples as well as the systematicity with which social class and emotion perception were operationalized. Here, we examine the generalizability of prior research across 10,000+ total participants. In an initial modest sample, (n = 179), Study 1 partially replicated past results: emotion identification correlated negativity with subjective social class (β = -0.15, 95% CI = [-0.28,-0.02]) and one of two objective social class measures (participant education β = -0.15, 95% CI = [-0.03,-0.01]). Studies 2–4 followed up on Study 1’s mixed results for objective social class in three much larger samples. These results diverged from past literature. In Study 2, complex emotion identification correlated non-significantly with participant education (β = 0.02, p = 0.25; 95% CI = [-0.01, 0.05], n = 2,726), positively with childhood family income (β = 0.03, 95% CI = [0.01,0.06], n = 4,312), and positively with parental education (β = 0.06, 95% CI = [0.04,0.09], n = 4,225). In Study 3, basic emotion identification correlated positively with participant education (β = 0.05, 95% CI = [0.02, 0.09]), n = 2,564). In Study 4, basic emotion discrimination correlated positively with participant education (β = 0.09, 95% CI = [0.05,0.13], n = 2,079), positively with parental education (β = 0.06, 95% CI = [0.02,0.09], n = 3,225), and non-significantly with childhood family income (β = 0.2, 95% CI = [0.01,0.07], n = 3,272). Results remained similar when restricting analyses to U.S.-based participants. Taken together, these findings suggest that previously reported negative correlations between emotion perception and social class may generalize poorly past select samples and/or subjective measures of social class. Data from the three large web-based samples used in Studies 2–4 are available at osf.io/jf7r3 as normative datasets and to support future investigations of these and other research questions."
https://openalex.org/W2895783088,"One of the most popular dog breeds deployed by both the police and military has been the German Shepherd yet little is known about the morphology or body segment parameters of this breed. Such measures are essential for developing biomechanical models which, in turn, may guide clinicians in developing surgical interventions, injury treatment and prevention procedures. This paper provides a complete set of body segment parameters and inertial properties for the German Shepherd. Morphometric measures and 3-dimensional inertial properties, including mass, centre of mass, moment of inertia and volume, were measured from 17 segments from 6 German Shepherd police service dog cadavers. Using whole body mass and geometric modelling, 11 regression equations were developed for predicting segment masses, and 33 equations were developed for predicting moments of inertia. Using these data, inverse dynamic analyses may be applied in future investigations of canine mechanics, guiding surgical procedures, rehabilitation and training especially for the German Shepherd breed but potentially for other breeds too."
https://openalex.org/W2896428584,We investigated whether negative feedback with information could benefit both behavioral and neural responses. Fifteen participants were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while receiving various feedbacks in a novel perceptual task. Behavioral data showed that reaction times of task performance were faster after receiving negative informative feedback compared to negative confirmatory feedback. The fMRI analysis of the interaction contrast between feedback type (informative vs. confirmatory) and valence (negative vs. positive) showed greater activation in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) and the ventral striatum in response to negative informative compared to confirmatory feedback. The psychophysiological interactions (PPI) analyses showed that the vlPFC activation was positively correlated with the amygdala and the rostral cingulate zone (RCZ). The ventral striatum activation was negatively correlated with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). These results suggest that negative but informative feedback benefits subsequent performance and its primary function is to elicit positive prediction error (instructive signal) and to induce cognitive control to guide subsequent goal-directed behavior.

The impact of a former TAVR on PMVR procedures is not clear.We retrospectively analyzed 332 patients undergoing PMVR using the MitraClip system with respect to procedural and clinical outcome. 21 of these 332 patients underwent TAVR before PMVR. Intra-procedural transthoracic (TTE) and transesophageal echocardiograms (TEE) immediately before and after clip implantation as well as invasive hemodynamic measurements were evaluated. At baseline, we found a significantly smaller mitral valve anterior-posterior diameter in the TAVR cohort (p < 0.001). A reduction of MR by at least three grades was achieved in a smaller fraction in the TAVR cohort as compared to the cohort with a native aortic valve (p = 0.02). Accordingly, we observed a smaller post-procedural cardiac output in the TAVR cohort (p = 0.02).PMVR in patients who had a TAVR before, is associated with altered MR anatomy before and a reduced improvement of MR after the procedure. Future larger and prospective studies will have to determine, whether a previous TAVR influences long-term clinical outcome of patients undergoing PMVR."
https://openalex.org/W2896761407,"For the full-bridge LLC converter, it is necessary to establish a large signal model with low-complexity and high-precision when the current of filter inductor works under the continuous conduction mode (CCM) situation. In terms of low complexity, peak values of resonant state variables and average values of slow state variables are taken as the measured indexes between models and actual converter. Models based on the first harmonic approximation (FHA) are studied in depth because they have lower complexity than the existing models. From prospective of high precision, deficiencies of typical FHA model are explained in the light of harmonic generation mechanism of primary current and influence of Fourier series on the typical equivalent circuit. Therefore, transient process of each metallic oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) and its related fast recovery diode, transient process of Schottky rectifier diodes, piecewise equivalent circuit, appropriate selection of variables, and simplified modified dynamic equations are all considered. Furthermore, the unified proposed model is achieved according to the equivalent principle of indexes between aforementioned improved analyses and proposed model. Numerical results of typical FHA model and proposed model are given in accordance with the key indexes. Then, corresponding experimental results are also presented. Differences of indexes between the two models and the actual converter are compared respectively. Though complexity of proposed model is the same as that of typical FHA model, precision of proposed model is higher than that of typical FHA model."

Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme system plays a crucial role in many gastrointestinal malignancies and is an important regulator of cell growth, proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation and transformation. More precise outcome of COX-2 in ESCC is less investigated. In this study we investigated the risk factors of ESCC and expression of COX-2 in Carcinoma in situ (CIS) and ESCC compared to normal esophageal mucosa. ESCC relationship to clinico-pathological parameters using immunohistochemistry was also part of this investigation. Current study was conducted in the Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Khyber Medical University, Peshawar, Pakistan. A total of 69 diagnosed patients of ESCC, both Pakistanis and Afghans were enrolled. Various risk factors associated with ESCC were recorded. Mean age at the time of diagnosis was 55 years. Out of 69 patients of ESCC 46 (67%) were users of dipping tobacco (Naswar). Expression of COX-2 was determined in normal esophageal mucosa, CIS and invasive ESCC using Immunohistochemistry (IHC). Differences of mean were computed using ANOVA followed by applying Post Hoc test. Patients were categorized as positive with high expression or negative with low to nil expression. ANOVA showed large differences in expression of COX-2 in normal healthy mucosa compared with CIS and ESCC with the mean difference of -9.529 and -7.370 respectively, p-value being <.05 at 95% confidence interval (CI). No significant difference was noticed in the expression of COX-2 in CIS compared with ESCC with p-value >.05 at 95% CI. Our complete cohort (23-85 years) showed statistically significant difference in the expression of COX-2 gene in ESCC and CIS tissue samples compared with normal healthy mucosa.

Public health theorists suggest that communities with high social capital are less vulnerable to such challenges and more likely to participate in community development. This research examines levels of social capital amongst rural communities in southern Malawi through data gathered as part of a participatory needs assessment for a Healthy Settings project, and discusses the potential benefits of having access to such data before project implementation. Social capital data was collected during 108 focus group discussions in 18 communities (split by gender, age, status) by adapting an existing mixed methods measurement tool, the Schutte tool. Five indicators were measured: sense of belonging, friendship, reliance, ability to work together and influence. Mean results showed all 18 communities had medium-high levels of social capital. Means from each group in the 18 communities highlighted the lowest social capital among the youth groups and the highest with the leaders. A more detailed breakdown highlighted that all groups had a strong sense of belonging to the community, while youth and women had lower social capital levels in terms of influence over local decisions and ability to rely on other community members. Incorporating social capital tools into community health needs assessments in low-income settings provides a valuable overview of community dynamics before project implementation, and Monitoring & Evaluation indicators which allow changes in social capital to be measured at different stages of the project."

Anesthesia procedures are well-developed for common laboratory mammals, but not as well established in reptiles. We assessed the performance of intramuscularly injected tiletamine (dissociative anesthetic) and zolazepam (benzodiazepine sedative) in fixed combination (2 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg) in comparison to 2 mg/kg of midazolam (benzodiazepine sedative) in ball pythons (Python regius). We measured heart and respiratory rates and quantified induction parameters (i.e., time to loss of righting reflex, time to loss of withdrawal reflex) and recovery parameters (i.e., time to regain righting reflex, withdrawal reflex, normal behavior). Mild decreases in heart and respiratory rates (median decrease of <10 beats per minute and <5 breaths per minute) were observed for most time points among all three anesthetic dose groups. No statistically significant difference between the median time to loss of righting reflex was observed among animals of any group (p = 0.783). However, the withdrawal reflex was lost in all snakes receiving 3mg/kg of tiletamine+zolazepam but not in all animals of the other two groups (p = 0.0004). In addition, the time for animals to regain the righting reflex and resume normal behavior was longer in the drug combination dose groups compared to the midazolam group (p = 0.0055). Our results indicate that midazolam is an adequate sedative for ball pythons but does not suffice to achieve reliable immobilization or anesthesia, whereas tiletamine+zolazepam achieves short-term anesthesia in a dose-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2896333173,"Introduction Bleeding is a common complication in patients taking warfarin. We sought to compare the performance of nine prediction models for bleeding risk in warfarin-treated Brazilian outpatients. Methods The dataset was derived from a clinical trial conducted to evaluate the efficacy of an anticoagulation clinic at a public hospital in Brazil. Overall, 280 heart disease outpatients taking warfarin were enrolled. The prediction models OBRI, Kuijer et al., Kearon et al., HEMORR2HAGES, Shireman et al., RIETE, HAS-BLED, ATRIA and ORBIT were compared to evaluate the overall model performance by Nagelkerke’s R2 estimation, discriminative ability based on the concordance (c) statistic and calibration based on the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic. The primary outcomes were the first episodes of major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding and non-major bleeding events within 12 months of follow-up. Results Major bleeding occurred in 14 participants (5.0%), clinically relevant non-major bleeding in 29 (10.4%), non-major bleeding in 154 (55.0%) and no bleeding at all in 115 (41.1%). Most participants with major bleeding had their risk misclassified. All the models showed low overall performance (R2 0.6–9.3%) and poor discriminative ability for predicting major bleeding (c <0.7), except Shireman et al. and ORBIT models (c 0.725 and 0.719, respectively). Results were not better for predicting other bleedings. All models showed good calibration for major bleeding. Conclusions Only two models (Shireman et al. and ORBIT) showed at least acceptable performance in the prediction of major bleeding in warfarin-treated Brazilian patients. Accurate models warrant further investigation to be used in similar populations."

We reviewed the records of 551 selected (78 non-Japanese and 473 Japanese) patients who started visiting our clinic between 2011 and 2014. A total of 390 patients (70.8%: 38 non-Japanese and 352 Japanese) continued their visits during the study: from the date of their first visit to the end of 2015. The difference in retention rate was not significant (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) = 0.89, p = 0.27), but the loss-to-follow-up cases were considerably high among non-Japanese patients (n = 13, Incidence rate (IR) = 24.6 per 100,000 person-days, IRR = 3.65, p<0.01 after adjusting for time since diagnosis). The results showed, nevertheless, that there was no apparent association between retention and factors peculiar to non-Japanese. Twelve out of thirteen lost-to-follow-up non-Japanese patients held legal status to reside in Japan and were eligible for public health services. Nine had limited fluency in Japanese language, and six used alternative verbal communication. Further studies are needed to identify the factors responsible for the high dropout rate and to improve the care of migrant patients living with HIV/AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W2897307580,In this paper I develop a model to reproduce the phenomenon of high intergenerational correlations in education observed in Latin American Countries. The model is based on empirical evidence and implemented through agent based modeling techniques. The effect of conditional cash transfer programs on educational mobility is then analyzed. The results suggest that conditional cash transfer program can substantially increase intergenerational mobility in education. I find that using parental education as eligibility criterion and adapting the subsidies to the income level can improve the efficiency of a program in increasing educational mobility as compared to a purely income based program.

Here, we show the up-regulation of TROY in human glioma tissues and cells. Inhibition of TROY expression slowed glioma development in vivo and in vitro. Raf kinase inhibitor (RKIP) was found to interact with TROY. The physical interaction of TROY/RKIP was confirmed via co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays. Furthermore, we found that the TROY/RKIP interaction was enhanced by fetal bovine serum (FBS) exposure, and TROY knockdown also led to down-regulation of NF-κB. Finally, disruption of the TROY/RKIP interaction using the TAT-TROY (234–371 aa) protein reduced the glioma development in xenografted mice.

https://openalex.org/W2897324788,"This study investigated the effect of enteral administration of obestatin on the development of small intestine, as well as oxidative stress markers and trancriptomic profile of gastrointestinal genes. Suckling rats were assigned to 3 groups treated with: C-saline solution; OL-obestatin (125 nmol/kg BW); OH-obestatin (250 nmol/kg BW) administered twice daily, from the 14th to the 21st day of life. Enteral administration of obestatin in both studied doses had no effect neither on the body weight of animals nor the BMI calculated in the day of euthanasia. Compared to the control group (C), treatment with obestatin resulted in significant changes in the histometry of the small intestinal wall as well as intestinal epithelial cell remodeling. The observed changes and their possible implications for intestinal development were dependent on the dosage of peptide. The enteral administration of high dose (OH) of obestatin significantly decreased its expression in the stomach and increased markers of oxidative stress. The gene profile revealed MAPK3 (mitogen-activated protein kinase-3) as the key regulator gene for obestatin action in the gastrointestinal track. In conclusion, we have showed that enteral administration of obestatin influences the gut mucosa remodeling. It is also suggested that the administration of high dose (OH) has inhibitory effect on the intestinal maturation of suckling rats."

We collected pneumococcal isolates from the lower respiratory tract of 27 patients with a tracheostomy and 42 patients intubated for acute conditions. We compared the penicillin susceptibility, rates of co-colonization, genetic background, and serotype of isolates colonizing these patient populations. Isolates from both groups showed high genetic diversity. Forty multi-locus sequence types and 20 serotypes were identified. There was no significant difference in serotype distribution, co-colonization rates, vaccine coverage, or non-susceptibility to penicillin among pneumococcal isolates from the two groups. Colonization of the lower airways with non-vaccine serotypes 15B/C, 23B and 35B was noted for the first time in patients with tracheostomies and supports recently observed increases in nasopharyngeal colonization and disease due to these serotypes."

Recent studies focused on a single sensor show that the neonatal period may represent a critical window and that immune interactions at this time could durably influence the members of the microbiome."
