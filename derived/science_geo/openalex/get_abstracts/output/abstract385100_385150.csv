The structure of a social network can dramatically affect the diffusion of behavior through a population. Centola (p. 1194 ) examined whether the number of individuals choosing to register for a health forum could be influenced by an artificially constructed network of neighbors that were signed up for the forum. The behavior spread more readily on clustered networks than on random, poorly clustered ones. Certain types of behavior within human systems are thus more likely to spread if people are exposed to many other people who have already adopted the behavior (for example, in the circumstances where your friends know each other, as well as yourself)."

Saberi M. Olefsky J.M. Insulin sensitivity: modulation by nutrients and inflammation.J. Clin. Invest. 2008; 118: 2992-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). This involves migration of monocytes/macrophages to adipose tissue (including intramuscular fat depots) and liver with subsequent activation of macrophage proinflammatory pathways and cytokine secretion. Through paracrine effects, these events promote inflammation and decreased insulin sensitivity in nearby insulin target cells (Shoelson et al., 2007Shoelson S.E. Herrero L. Naaz A.

In these studies, we explore the interlocking biology between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules within the specialized population of proinflammatory tissue macrophages. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important signaling molecules for many aspects of cellular function. They are members of a large family that share common structural motifs such as seven transmembrane helices and the ability to activate heterotrimeric G proteins, such as Gαs, Gαi, and Gαq. Ligands bind specifically to GPCRs to stimulate and induce a variety of cellular responses via several second messenger pathways; e.g., modulation of cAMP production, the phospholipase C pathway, ion channels, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (Ulloa-Aguirre et al., 1999Ulloa-Aguirre A.

Recently, several groups reported that five orphan receptors, GPR40, GPR41, GPR43, GPR84, and GPR120, can be activated by free fatty acids (FFAs). Short-chain fatty acids (FAs) are specific agonists for GPR41 and GPR43 (Tazoe et al., 2008Tazoe H. Otomo Y. Kaji I. Tanaka R. Karaki S.I. Kuwahara A. Roles of short-chain fatty acids receptors, GPR41 and GPR43 on colonic functions.J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2008; 59: 251-262PubMed Google Scholar) and medium-chain FAs for GPR84 (Wang et al., 2006aWang J. Wu X. Simonavicius N. Tian H. Ling L. Medium-chain fatty acids as ligands for orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR84.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34457-34464Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Long-chain FAs can activate GPR40 (Itoh et al., 2003Itoh Y. Kawamata Y. Harada M. Kobayashi M. Fujii R. Fukusumi S. Ogi K. Hosoya M. Tanaka Y. Uejima H. et al.Free fatty acids regulate insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells through GPR40.Nature. 2003; 422: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar) and GPR120 (Hirasawa et al., 2005Hirasawa A. Tsumaya K. Awaji T. Katsuma S. Adachi T. Yamada M. Sugimoto Y. Miyazaki S. Tsujimoto G. Free fatty acids regulate gut incretin glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion through GPR120.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Hirasawa et al. showed that the stimulation of GPR120 by FFAs resulted in elevation of [Ca2+]i and activation of the ERK cascade which suggests interactions with the Gαq family of G proteins. However, other physiological functions of GPR120 remain to be explored. In the current study, we found that GPR120 was highly expressed in adipose tissue, and proinflammatory macrophages. The high expression level of GPR120 in mature adipocytes and macrophages indicates that GPR120 might play an important role in these cell types. We stimulated GPR120 with a synthetic agonist (GW9508) and omega-3 fatty acids (ω-3 FAs) and examined whether activation of GPR120 affected LPS- and TNF-α-induced inflammatory signaling responses. While SFAs are proinflammatory and unsaturated FAs are generally neutral, we found that ω-3 FAs (docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n3, DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n3, EPA)), the major ingredients in fish oil, exert potent anti-inflammatory effects through GPR120. β-arrestins can serve as scaffold or adaptor proteins for a wide range of GPCRs, as well as a selected group of other receptor subtypes (Miller and Lefkowitz, 2001Miller W.E. Lefkowitz R.J. Expanding roles for beta-arrestins as scaffolds and adapters in GPCR signaling and trafficking.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). After ligand binding, β-arrestins can associate with the cytoplasmic domains of GPCRs and couple the receptor to specific downstream signaling pathways, as well as mediate receptor endocytosis (Luttrell and Lefkowitz, 2002Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. The role of beta-arrestins in the termination and transduction of G-protein-coupled receptor signals.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 455-465Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we find that β-arrestin2 associates with ligand-stimulated GPR120 and participates in downstream signaling mechanisms. Since chronic inflammation is a mechanistic feature of obesity-related insulin resistance, we postulated that the anti-inflammatory effect of GPR120 stimulation could promote insulin sensitization. In the present study, we elucidate the role of GPR120 activation in integrating anti-inflammatory and insulin sensitizing effects in vitro and in vivo. Fatty acids (FAs) can function as endogenous ligands modulating inflammatory responses, but not all FAs work in the same way. In general, saturated FAs (SFAs) are proinflammatory, unsaturated FAs are weakly proinflammatory or neutral, and ω3-FAs can be anti-inflammatory (Lee et al., 2003Lee J.Y. Plakidas A. Lee W.H. Heikkinen A. Chanmugam P. Bray G. Hwang D.H. Differential modulation of Toll-like receptors by fatty acids: preferential inhibition by n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.J.

JNK in hematopoietically derived cells contributes to diet-induced inflammation and insulin resistance without affecting obesity.Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 386-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Because of the importance of inflammation in a number of chronic human diseases including insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, we surveyed the family of FA sensing GPCRs (GPR40, 41, 43, 84, and 120). Based on its tissue expression pattern, GPR120 emerged as a receptor of particular interest. As seen in Figure 1, GPR120 is the only lipid sensing GPCR which is highly expressed in adipose tissue, proinflammatory CD11c+ macrophages (BMDCs), mature adipocytes, and monocytic RAW 264.7 cells (Figure 1A and 1B). GPR120 is induced in the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of adipose tissue (which contains the macrophages), as well as in hepatic Kupffer cells, during high-fat diet (HFD) feeding in mice (Figure 1C). GPR120 is also expressed in enteroendocrine L cells with negligible expression in muscle (Figure S4C available online), hepatocytes or other cell types (Hirasawa et al., 2005Hirasawa A. Tsumaya K. Awaji T. Katsuma S. Adachi T. Yamada M. Sugimoto Y. Miyazaki S. Tsujimoto G. Free fatty acids regulate gut incretin glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion through GPR120.Nat.

Tsujimoto G. et al.The regulation of adipogenesis through GPR120.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 354: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). It has been previously reported that GPR120 signals via a Gαq/11-coupled pathway and can respond to long chain FAs (Hirasawa et al., 2005Hirasawa A. Tsumaya K. Awaji T. Katsuma S. Adachi T. Yamada M. Sugimoto Y. Miyazaki S. Tsujimoto G. Free fatty acids regulate gut incretin glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion through GPR120.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). To pursue the biology of GPR120, a tool compound was needed, and, some years ago, Glaxo published GW9508 as a GPR40 selective agonist. However, this compound was not specific and also stimulated GPR120 (Briscoe et al., 2006Briscoe C.P. Peat A.J. McKeown S.C. Corbett D.F. Goetz A.S. Littleton T.R. McCoy D.C. Kenakin T.P. Andrews J.L. Ammala C. et al.Pharmacological regulation of insulin secretion in MIN6 cells through the fatty acid receptor GPR40: identification of agonist and antagonist small molecules.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 148: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Since macrophages and adipocytes do not express GPR40 (this was confirmed by repeated q-PCR and RT-PCR measures, Figure S1A), GW9508 is a functional GPR120 specific compound in these cell types. Using this approach, we found that GW9508 treatment broadly and markedly repressed the ability of the TLR4 ligand LPS to stimulate inflammatory responses in RAW 264.7 cells (Figure 1D and E). Thus, GW9508 inhibited LPS stimulated phosphorylation of IKKβ and JNK, prevented IκB degradation, and inhibited TNF-α and IL-6 secretion. All of these effects of GW9508 were completely abrogated by siRNA mediated knockdown of GPR120 (Figures 1D and 1E and Figure S1F ). Based on these remarkable anti-inflammatory effects of GPR120 stimulation, we established a cell based reporter system by transfecting HEK293 cells with constructs for GPR120 along with a serum response element-luciferase promoter/reporter (SRE-luc). Since GPR120 is a Gαq/11-coupled receptor, it stimulates both PKC and MAP kinase, and both of these biologic effects are detected by the SRE-driven reporter system (Oh et al., 2005Oh D.Y. Song J.A. Moon J.S. Moon M.J. Kim J.I. Kim K. Kwon H.B. Seong J.Y. Membrane-proximal region of the carboxyl terminus of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR) confers differential signal transduction between mammalian and nonmammalian GnRHRs.Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 722-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The reporter cells were treated with various FAs and the synthetic GW9508 ligand. We found that GW9508, the ω-3 FAs (DHA and EPA) and palmitoleate (C16:1n7), all activated the SRE-luc reporter with an EC50 of 1-10 μM (Figure 2A ), while SFAs were without effect. GW9508 and DHA were used at 100 μM in all subsequent studies to achieve maximal action. The ω-3 FAs (DHA and α-linolenic acid), and SFA (palmitic acid (C16:0)) activated ERK phosphorylation in RAW 264.7 cells, but only DHA- and α-linolenic acid-mediated ERK phosphorylation were abolished by GPR120 knockdown (Figure S2A ). These results indicate that ω-3 FAs, but not SFAs, specifically activated ERK via GPR120.Figure S2DHA-Stimulated GPR120 Inhibits TNF-α, TLR2, and TLR3-Induced Inflammation via a β-arrestin2-Dependent Mechanism, Related to Figure 2 and Figure 3Show full caption(A) ERK1/2 phosphorylation stimulated by GPR120 activation in RAW 264.7 cells transfected with scrambled or GPR120 siRNA.

(D) To characterize the interaction site between β-arrestin2 and GPR120 or TAB1, HA-tagged GPR120 and FLAG-tagged serial C-terminal deletion mutants of β-arrestin2 (full, 1-300, 1-253, 1-176, and 1-163) or an N-terminal deletion mutant (80-410) were cotransfected in 293 cells. For immunoprecipitation of FLAG-βarr2 and HA-GPR120, cells were treated with DHA for 30 min, while DHA was used for 1 hr to detect endogenous TAB1 and FLAG-βarr2 interactions. The activation of GPR120 by ω-3 FAs, as well as its expression in adipocytes and macrophages, led us to study whether DHA, a representative ω-3 FA, can modulate inflammation through GPR120 in these cells. To examine this, we pretreated RAW 264.7 cells and 3T3-L1 adipocytes with GW9508 or DHA for 1 hr, followed by LPS (TLR4), TNF-α, TLR2, or TLR3 stimulation, respectively. We found that GW9508 and, more importantly, DHA, strongly inhibited LPS-induced phosphorylation of JNK and IKKβ, IκB degradation, cytokine secretion and inflammatory gene expression level in RAW 264.7 cells (Figures 2B–2D) as well as TNF-α, TLR2 and TLR3-induced JNK and IKKβ phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Figure S2B) or RAW 264.7 cells (Figure S2C). All of the effects of GW9508 and DHA were completely prevented by GPR120 knockdown, demonstrating that these anti-inflammatory effects were specifically exerted through GPR120 (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure S1, and Figure S2). Similar results were seen in primary wild-type (WT) intraperitoneal macrophages (IPMacs) and GPR120 knockout (KO) IPMacs (Figures 2E and 2F). These data argue that GPR120 is an ω-3 FA receptor or sensor, and provide a molecular mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effects of this class of FAs. Given these potent cell selective anti-inflammatory effects, it was of interest to understand the specific mechanisms whereby signals from GPR120 inhibit inflammatory pathways. To further assess this, we used RNA interference to examine molecules involved in generation of GPR120 signals. As seen in Figures 3A and 3B , LPS signaling was not affected by β-arrestin1, -2, or Gαq/11 knockdown. However, with β-arrestin2 knockdown, DHA-mediated anti-inflammatory signaling was extinguished, while β-arrestin1 and Gαq/11 knockdown were without effect (Figure 3A). Figure 3A and Figure S2 show that GPR120 stimulation inhibits both TLR4- and TNF-α mediated inflammatory responses. Since the TNF-α and TLR signaling cascades converge downstream of GPR120 activation, these results indicate that the site of GPR120-induced inhibition is either at, or upstream, of JNK/IKKβ. LPS activates inflammation through the TLR4 pathway by engaging the serine kinase IRAK, leading to phosphorylation of transforming growth factor-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1) which is upstream of MKK4/JNK and IKKβ (Kawai and Akira, 2006Kawai T. Akira S. TLR signaling.Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1440) Google Scholar, Figure 3I). TNF-α and TLR2/3 also leads to stimulation of TAK1, resulting in activation of IKKβ and JNK (Takaesu et al., 2003Takaesu G. Surabhi R.M. Park K.J. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Gaynor R.B. TAK1 is critical for IkappaB kinase-mediated activation of the NF-kappaB pathway.J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 326: 105-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Consequently, we determined whether DHA stimulation of GPR120 inhibited TAK1 and MKK4. As seen in Figure 3C, DHA treatment abrogated LPS-induced TAK1 and MKK4 phosphorylation in a GPR120 and β-arrestin2-dependent manner. Since TLR2/3/4 and TNF-α signaling were inhibited by GPR120 activation, these results indicate that DHA signaling intersects at TAK1 and inhibits all upstream input activating signals via a GPR120/β-arrestin2 interaction (Figure 3I). After ligand stimulation, β-arrestin2 can translocate to a number of GPCRs where it mediates receptor internalization and signaling (Barak et al., 1997Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. A beta-arrestin/green fluorescent protein biosensor for detecting G protein-coupled receptor activation.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). We transfected HEK293 cells with β-arrestin2·GFP to visualize intracellular trafficking of β-arrestin2 following activation of GPR120 (Figure 3D). In the basal state, GPR120 was localized to the plasma membrane as assessed by immunostaining (red fluorescence, Figure 3D), while β-arrestin2 exhibited a diffuse, largely cytoplasmic staining pattern (green, Figure 3D). Following DHA treatment for 5 min, β-arrestin2·GFP translocated from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and can be seen colocalized with GPR120 (merged, right fields). After 30 min of DHA treatment, much of the GPR120 is internalized, as visualized by punctate intracellular staining (lower left panel), and β-arrestin2·GFP is now colocalized with the intracellular GPR120 (lower right panel, Figure 3D). DHA-stimulated binding of β-arrestin2 to activated GPR120 was also detected by coimmunoprecipitation (Figure 3E and F). LPS or TNF-α signaling activate TAK1 by causing the association of TAK1 binding protein 1 (TAB1) with TAK1. Figure 3H shows that LPS stimulation of RAW 264.7 cells causes TAB1/TAK1 association. DHA treatment leads to the association of β-arrestin2 with TAB1 (Figure 3G) and largely blocks TAK1/TAB1 association (Figure 3H). To further examine the interaction site of β-arrestin2 and GPR120 or TAB1, we pursued coimmunoprecipitation with a series of β-arrestin2 truncation/deletion mutants (Figure S2D). Full-length β-arrestin2 was able to bind to GPR120 and TAB1 only in the presence of DHA, clearly showing the DHA dependency of this interaction. Interestingly, only the full-length β-arrestin2 coprecipitated with GPR120 and TAB1, while a series of deletion/truncation β-arrestin2 mutants did not, indicating that the interactions are dependent on the complete tertiary structure of β-arrestin2 (Figure S2D; Luttrell et al., 1999Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. et al.Beta-arrestin-dependent formation of beta2 adrenergic receptor-Src protein kinase complexes.Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1202) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that GPR120 activation leads to association of β-arrestin2 with the receptor and that this complex subsequently internalizes, whereupon β-arrestin2 can bind to TAB1. The data further suggest that association of β-arrestin2 with TAB1 blocks TAB1/TAK1 binding, resulting in inhibition of TAK1 phosphorylation and activation (Figure 3I). Since our data show that GPR120 is expressed in mature adipocytes and signals through Gαq/11 in these cells, we assessed the effects of GPR120 stimulation on insulin sensitivity in primary adipose tissue cultures and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Primary adipose tissue explants and 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated for 30 min with GW9508 or DHA, followed by measurement of basal and insulin stimulated GLUT4 translocation (Figure 4A ) and 2-deoxyglucose (2-DOG) transport (Figures 4B–4H). Ligand-stimulation of GPR120 led to an increase in glucose transport and translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in adipocytes, but was without effect in muscle cells (Figure S4D) which don't express GPR120 (Figure 1B and Figure S4C). This stimulatory effect of DHA and GW9508 was blocked when GPR120 or Gαq/11 was depleted by siRNA knockdown (Figure 4D and Figure 4F). GLUT4 knockdown also blocked the effects of DHA and GW9508, while the effects of insulin were decreased by ∼90% (Figure 4E). This, along with the GLUT4 translocation data provided in Figure 4A, indicates that the stimulatory effects of GPR120 are indeed working through GLUT4. Further assessment of this pathway showed that DHA had a modest effect to stimulate phosphorylation of Akt, but that this was abrogated with GPR120 knockdown (Figure S3A ). The effects of DHA to stimulate Akt were blocked by inhibiting PI3 kinase with LY294002 (Figure S3B). Finally, DHA did not stimulate IRS-1 phosphorylation (Figure S3C), indicating that its glucose transport stimulatory effects were downstream of IRS-1. Knockdown of Gαq/11 also completely blocked the effects of DHA to stimulate glucose transport (Figure 4F), while β-arrestin1 or -2 knockdown was without effect (Figures 4G and 4H). Interestingly, Gαq/11 knockdown not only inhibited DHA and GW9508 stimulated glucose transport, but it also attenuated insulin stimulatory effects, and the latter is fully consistent with previous publication (Imamura et al., 1999Imamura T. Vollenweider P. Egawa K. Clodi M. Ishibashi K. Nakashima N. Ugi S. Adams J.W. Brown J.H. Olefsky J.M.

Mechanically activated (MA) cation channel activities have been recorded in many cells, but the responsible molecules have not been identified. We characterized a rapidly adapting MA current in a mouse neuroblastoma cell line. Expression profiling and RNA interference knockdown of candidate genes identified Piezo1 (Fam38A) to be required for MA currents in these cells. Piezo1 and related Piezo2 (Fam38B) are vertebrate multipass transmembrane proteins with homologs in invertebrates, plants, and protozoa. Overexpression of mouse Piezo1 or Piezo2 induced two kinetically distinct MA currents. Piezos are expressed in several tissues, and knockdown of Piezo2 in dorsal root ganglia neurons specifically reduced rapidly adapting MA currents. We propose that Piezos are components of MA cation channels."

CD47 is a prognostic factor and therapeutic target in non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) Anti-CD47 antibody synergizes with rituximab to eradicate NHL in vitro and in vivo Antibody synergy occurs by Fc receptor-independent and -dependent mechanisms Anti-CD47 mAb synergy with FcR-activating mAbs may be applicable to other cancers Emerging evidence has demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) either alone or in combination are an effective modality for cancer treatment (Adams and Weiner, 2005Adams G.P. Weiner L.M. Monoclonal antibody therapy of cancer.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Although therapies combining a mAb with chemotherapeutic agents are effective in several human cancers, antibodies alone are not curative. Antibodies effective against cancer are believed to function by several mechanisms including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), stimulation of complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), inhibition of signal transduction, or direct induction of apoptosis (Cheson and Leonard, 2008Cheson B.D. Leonard J.P. Monoclonal antibody therapy for B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 359: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is the fifth most common cancer in the United States consisting of indolent and aggressive subtypes with a 5 year overall survival ranging from 25%–75% (The International Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Prognostic Factors Project, 1993The International Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Prognostic Factors ProjectA predictive model for aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar). The anti-CD20 antibody, rituximab (Rituxan), is a standard therapy for many CD20-positive B cell lymphomas and significantly improves long-term survival in combination with conventional chemotherapy (Cheson and Leonard, 2008Cheson B.D. Leonard J.P. Monoclonal antibody therapy for B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 359: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). As a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy, rituximab is not curative in the majority of B cell NHL patients and rituximab resistance has been observed (reviewed in Cheson and Leonard, 2008Cheson B.D. Leonard J.P. Monoclonal antibody therapy for B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 359: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Multiple lines of evidence indicate that rituximab acts at least in part by engaging Fc receptors (FcRs) on immune effector cells, such as NK cells and macrophages, and stimulating effector functions such as ADCC (Glennie et al., 2007Glennie M.J. French R.R. Cragg M.S. Taylor R.P. Mechanisms of killing by anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies.Mol. Immunol. 2007; 44: 3823-3837Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, Nimmerjahn and Ravetch, 2007Nimmerjahn F. Ravetch J.V. Antibodies, Fc receptors and cancer.Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2007; 19: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Although resistance has been reported to occur through several mechanisms (Cartron et al., 2004Cartron G. Watier H. Golay J. Solal-Celigny P. From the bench to the bedside: ways to improve rituximab efficacy.Blood. 2004; 104: 2635-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar), there has been limited development of agents that can overcome this resistance. Immune effector cells, including NK cells and phagocytes, are critical to the efficacy of many anticancer antibodies. Phagocytic cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, express signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPα), which binds CD47, a widely expressed transmembrane protein (Brown and Frazier, 2001Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. Integrin-associated protein (CD47) and its ligands.Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 130-135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). CD47-mediated activation of SIRPα initiates a signal transduction cascade resulting in inhibition of phagocytosis (reviewed in Jaiswal et al., 2010Jaiswal S. Chao M.P. Majeti R. Weissman I.L. Macrophages as mediators of tumor immunosurveillance.Trends Immunol. 2010; 31: 212-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In identifying a role for CD47 in cancer pathogenesis, we previously demonstrated that forced expression of mouse CD47 on a human leukemia cell line facilitated tumor engraftment in immunodeficient mice through the evasion of phagocytosis (Jaiswal et al., 2009Jaiswal S. Jamieson C.H. Pang W.W. Park C.Y. Chao M.P. Majeti R. Traver D. van Rooijen N. Weissman I.L. CD47 is upregulated on circulating hematopoietic stem cells and leukemia cells to avoid phagocytosis.Cell. 2009; 138: 271-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that this mechanism could be targeted therapeutically in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a blocking anti-CD47 antibody that enabled phagocytosis and eliminated AML stem cells (Majeti et al., 2009Majeti R. Chao M.P. Alizadeh A.A. Pang W.W. Jaiswal S. Gibbs Jr., K.D. van Rooijen N. Weissman I.L. CD47 is an adverse prognostic factor and therapeutic antibody target on human acute myeloid leukemia stem cells.Cell. 2009; 138: 286-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Based on this antibody mechanism, we hypothesized that the combination of a blocking anti-CD47 antibody with a second FcR-activating antibody would both prevent an inhibitory signal and deliver a positive stimulus, resulting in the synergistic phagocytosis and elimination of target cells. Here, we tested this antibody synergy hypothesis by investigating the combination of a blocking anti-CD47 mAb with rituximab against human NHL. We examined CD47 protein expression on primary human NHL samples and normal B cells by flow cytometry. Compared to both normal peripheral blood and germinal center B cells, CD47 was more highly expressed on a large subset of primary patient samples from multiple B cell NHL subtypes (Figure 1A and Figure S1A available online), including diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), and pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL). Across NHL subtypes, we found differing levels of CD47 expression that also varied within each NHL subtype (Figure 1B).Figure S1CD47 Is an Independent Adverse Prognostic Factor and Is Associated with Adverse Molecular Features of DLBCL and CLL, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Clinical features of primary human NHL samples used in vitro and/or in vivo are shown.

Chao M.P. Alizadeh A.A. Pang W.W. Jaiswal S. Gibbs Jr., K.D. van Rooijen N. Weissman I.L. CD47 is an adverse prognostic factor and therapeutic antibody target on human acute myeloid leukemia stem cells.Cell. 2009; 138: 286-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar), we assessed CD47 mRNA expression across NHL subtypes for associations with morphologic and molecular subgroups using gene expression data from previously described patient cohorts (Table S1) and investigated the prognostic implications of increased CD47 expression in disease outcome. Higher CD47 expression was associated with adverse prognosis in DLBCL, B-CLL, and MCL (Figures 1C–1E). In patients with DLBCL, whether treated with or without rituximab-based combination chemotherapy (Figure 1C and Figure S1B), higher CD47 expression was significantly associated with risk of death. This increased risk was largely due to disease progression (Figure S1C), a finding validated in an independent cohort of patients using quantitative RT-PCR on fixed archival specimens (Figure S1D). We next investigated whether increased CD47 expression was associated with known adverse molecular features in NHL. In DLBCL, prior studies have identified two distinct subgroups based on the presumed cell of origin of tumors: normal germinal center B cells (GCB-like), which are associated with a favorable clinical outcome, or activated blood memory B cells (ABC-like), which are associated with a poor clinical outcome (Alizadeh et al., 2000Alizadeh A.A.

Med. 2002; 346: 1937-1947Crossref PubMed Scopus (2965) Google Scholar). CD47 expression was significantly higher in ABC-like DLBCL (Figure 1F and Figure S1E). CD47 expression was not found to have independent prognostic value within GCB and ABC subtypes, suggesting a strong association with the cell-of-origin classification of DLBCL. Higher CD47 expression was also associated with unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regions (IgVH) in CLL (Figure 1G and Figure S1E) and significantly correlated with the proliferative index in MCL (Figure 1H), both known adverse prognostic factors (Katzenberger et al., 2006Katzenberger T.

In multivariate analyses, CD47 expression remained prognostic of disease progression independent from the international prognostic index in DLBCL (The International Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Prognostic Factors Project, 1993The International Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma Prognostic Factors ProjectA predictive model for aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 987-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar) and two major prognostic factors in CLL: IgVH mutation status and ZAP-70 status (Figure S1G). Within the small MCL cohort, a multivariate model did not find independent prognostic value for CD47 when considering the proliferation index (data not shown). We first tested the ability of anti-human CD47 antibodies to enable phagocytosis of human NHL cell lines, primary NHL cells, and normal peripheral blood (NPB) cells by human macrophages in vitro. Incubation of NHL cells in the presence of IgG1 isotype control or anti-CD45 IgG1 antibody did not result in significant phagocytosis; however, two different blocking anti-CD47 antibodies (B6H12.2 and BRIC126) enabled phagocytosis of NHL cells but not NPB cells (Figures 2A and 2B ). Next, we repeated the in vitro phagocytosis assays with mouse macrophages. Incubation of NHL cells in the presence of IgG1 isotype control or anti-CD45 IgG1 antibody did not result in significant phagocytosis; however, phagocytosis of NHL cells was observed with blocking antibodies to CD47 (B6H12.2 and BRIC126), whereas no phagocytosis was observed with a nonblocking antibody (2D3) (Figure 2B). Disruption of the CD47-SIRPα interaction with an anti-mouse SIRPα antibody also resulted in significant phagocytosis (Figure 2B). Given variable expression of CD47 on primary NHL, we investigated by two independent methods whether CD47 expression levels correlated with the degree of anti-CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis. First, lentiviral shRNA vectors were used to knock down expression of CD47 in Raji cells. Several clones were generated with a range of CD47 knockdown (Figures S2A and S2B ). Those clones with a greater than 50% reduction in CD47 expression (shCD47-1 and shCD47-2) demonstrated a significant reduction in anti-CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis (Figure S3C ). In the second approach, a statistical analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between CD47 expression and degree of anti-CD47 antibody-mediated phagocytosis with both mouse and human macrophage effector cells (Figure S2D).Figure S3Ex vivo Coating of NHL Cells with Rituximab Inhibits Tumor Engraftment, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Luciferase-expressing Raji cells were incubated ex vivo with 30 μg/ml of human IgG1 isotype control antibody or rituximab and assessed for coating by flow cytometry.(B) Coated cells were injected intravenously into adult SCID mice, and two weeks later were subject to bioluminescent imaging.(C) Bioluminescence was quantified (n = 2 per antibody condition).

It has been reported that immobilized or crosslinked antibodies against CD47 induce apoptosis of primary human B-CLL cells, as well as several malignant lymphoid cell lines (Kikuchi et al., 2004Kikuchi Y.

Rep. 2007; 17: 1189-1194PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, anti-CD47 antibodies might be predicted to directly induce apoptosis of NHL cells that are then recognized by macrophages and phagocytosed. Contrary to this prediction, when NHL cells were incubated with anti-CD47 antibody in the absence of macrophages, no induction of apoptosis was observed when cells were incubated in suspension for either 2 hr (Figure 2B, right) or 8 hr (Figures S2E and S2F). Incubation of NHL cells with immobilized anti-CD47 antibody resulted in increased apoptosis compared to controls (Figures S2G and S2H), consistent with prior reports (Mateo et al., 1999Mateo V. Lagneaux L. Bron D. Biron G. Armant M. Delespesse G. Sarfati M. CD47 ligation induces caspase-independent cell death in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 1277-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Given that phagocytosis of NHL cells occurs in the presence of soluble anti-CD47 mAbs, it is unlikely that these mAbs induce apoptosis of NHL cells that are then secondarily phagocytosed. Next, we tested the ability of a blocking anti-CD47 mAb to synergize with rituximab in the phagocytosis of NHL cells. We examined CD20 expression on NHL cells and found no difference between normal B cells and NHL cells (Figures S2I and S2J). Incubation of NHL cells with rituximab in the presence of mouse or human macrophages resulted in significant phagocytosis (Figures 2D and S2E). We then tested the synergy hypothesis by isobologram analysis (Chou, 2008Chou T.C. Preclinical versus clinical drug combination studies.Leuk. Lymphoma. 2008; 49: 2059-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, Tallarida, 2006Tallarida R.J. An overview of drug combination analysis with isobolograms.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 319: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Using Raji, SUDHL4, and NHL17 cells, which express varying levels of both CD47 and CD20 (Figure S2K), anti-CD47 antibody synergized with rituximab or anti-human CD20 (mouse IgG2a) antibody, as indicated by combination indices less than 1 (Figure 2C). In a second approach, in vitro phagocytosis assays were conducted with primary NHL cells incubated with either anti-CD47 antibody or rituximab alone, or both in combination at half of the single agent dose. NHL cells exhibited a significant increase in phagocytosis when incubated with the combination compared to either antibody alone when using mouse (Figure 2D) or human (Figure 2E) macrophage effectors. No phagocytosis of NPB cells was observed with either antibody alone or in combination with human macrophages (Figure 2E). Next, the ability of blocking anti-CD47 antibody to eliminate NHL in vivo either alone or in combination with rituximab was explored by two separate treatment strategies. First, the effect of ex vivo anti-CD47 antibody coating on the engraftment of human NHL cells was tested. Luciferase-expressing Raji and SUDHL4 cell lines were precoated ex vivo with anti-CD47, IgG1 isotype control, or anti-CD45 antibody and transplanted intravenously into SCID mice. Coating with anti-CD47 antibody prevented engraftment of both cell lines (Figures 3A–3F ). Coating of Raji cells with rituximab also inhibited engraftment when transplanted into SCID mice (Figure S3). In addition to these cell lines, we identified a primary NHL patient specimen that engrafted in NSG mice in the bone marrow upon intravenous transplantation (Figures S5A and S5B). As with"

The mechanisms that globally orient planar polarity are not understood, and are investigated here in the Drosophila wing using a combination of experiment and theory. Planar polarity arises during growth and PCP domains are initially oriented toward the well-characterized organizer regions that control growth and patterning. At pupal stages, the wing hinge contracts, subjecting wing-blade epithelial cells to anisotropic tension in the proximal-distal axis. This results in precise patterns of oriented cell elongation, cell rearrangement and cell division that elongate the blade proximo-distally and realign planar polarity with the proximal-distal axis. Mutation of the atypical Cadherin Dachsous perturbs the global polarity pattern by altering epithelial dynamics. This mechanism utilizes the cellular movements that sculpt tissues to align planar polarity with tissue shape."

One of the ultimate goals of regenerative medicine, however, is to grow organs using the patient's own stem cells and to transplant those organs into the patient. With the development of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, we are now able to obtain patient-derived PSCs (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T.

Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17010) Google Scholar), although actual developmental potentials remain to be defined, as do risks associated with somatic cell reprogramming. The real challenge is to create a reproductive system for generation of PSC-derived organs. The interactions among cells and tissues during development and organogenesis are so complex that the recapitulation of these interactions to generate organs in vitro is essentially impractical. We have challenged this goal using the biology of blastocyst complementation. Blastocyst complementation was first reported by Chen et al. They demonstrated that deficiency of T and B lymphocyte lineages in Rag2-deficient (Rag2−/−) mice was complemented by injecting normal mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) into Rag2−/− mouse-derived blastocysts (Chen et al., 1993Chen J. Lansford R. Stewart V. Young F. Alt F.W. RAG-2-deficient blastocyst complementation: an assay of gene function in lymphocyte development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90: 4528-4532Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Because Rag2 is an indispensable enzyme for rearrangement of immunoglobulin and T cell receptor genes, the T and B cells generated in the complemented animals were mESC derived; there were no host T or B lymphocytes. We assumed that this complementation was possible because the Rag2−/− host, incapable of generating mature T and B cells, provided a “developmental niche” for ESC-derived T and B cells. We hypothesized that with blastocysts derived from a mutant mouse strain in which the gene necessary to form a particular organ is deficient, the same principle might apply. To test this hypothesis, we used, in this study, blastocyst complementation to generate functional pancreas from donor PSCs. The pancreas, consisting of endocrine and exocrine glands, is formed by early embryonic interactions of mesenchyme and epithelium (Slack, 1995Slack J.M. Developmental biology of the pancreas.Development. 1995; 121: 1569-1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pdx1 (pancreatic and duodenal homeobox1) is a Hox-type transcription factor that plays a critical role in pancreatic development and β cell maturation. Homozygous deficiency of Pdx1 in the mouse results in death soon after birth due to pancreatic insufficiency (Offield et al., 1996Offield M.F. Jetton T.L. Labosky P.A. Ray M. Stein R.W. Magnuson M.A. Hogan B.L. Wright C.V. PDX-1 is required for pancreatic outgrowth and differentiation of the rostral duodenum.Development. 1996; 122: 983-995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of Pdx1 thus should empty a pancreatic “developmental niche” in embryos derived from Pdx1−/− blastocysts. Therefore, injection of mouse PSCs (mPSCs) into Pdx1−/− blastocysts should result in generation of pancreata almost entirely derived from injected mPSCs. Although our results verified our initial hypothesis, this system cannot be applied to generate human organs. A xenogenic, but not allogenic, blastocyst complementation system must therefore be established. However, little is known about the nature of the xenogenic barrier, how organogenesis by donor PSCs is influenced, or how intrinsic developmental programs can be regulated in xenogenic environments. To address these issues, we attempted to generate interspecific chimeras between mouse and rat using a blastocyst injection technique with mouse and rat PSCs. Generation of interspecific chimeras in livestock animals using preimplantation embryos of each species is described; the “geep,” or chimera between goat and sheep, is famous as an interspecific live chimera (Fehilly et al., 1984Fehilly C.B. Willadsen S.M. Tucker E.M. Interspecific chimaerism between sheep and goat.Nature. 1984; 307: 634-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In rodents, however, methods like those producing the geep succeeded only between mouse subspecies, such as Mus musculus and Mus caroli, that are closely related but not capable of interbreeding (Rossant and Frels, 1980Rossant J. Frels W.I. Interspecific chimeras in mammals: successful production of live chimeras between Mus musculus and Mus caroli.Science. 1980; 208: 419-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Many groups have sought to generate interspecific chimeras between mouse and rat, successful with chimeric preimplantation embryos in vitro but failing with live chimeric animals (Stern, 1973Stern M.S. Letter: Chimaeras obtained by aggregation of mouse eggs with rat eggs.Nature. 1973; 243: 472-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, Zeilmaker, 1973Zeilmaker G.H. Fusion of rat and mouse morulae and formation of chimaeric blastocysts.Nature. 1973; 242: 115-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Extraembryonic lineage cells like trophectoderm or primitive endoderm, derived from xenogenic embryos, might suffer inhibition of implantation on exposure to host uterus; inhibition of further intrauterine development also is possible (Rossant et al., 1982Rossant J. Mauro V.M. Croy B.A. Importance of trophoblast genotype for survival of interspecific murine chimaeras.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1982; 69: 141-149PubMed Google Scholar, Tarkowski, 1962Tarkowski A.K. Inter-specific transfers of eggs between rat and mouse.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1962; 10: 476-495PubMed Google Scholar). Only cells of pre-blastocyst origin can contribute to extraembryonic lineage cells, and mESCs/iPSCs do not thus contribute (Rossant, 2007Rossant J. Stem cells and lineage development in the mammalian blastocyst.Reprod. Fertil. Dev. 2007; 19: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, we rechallenged this old issue with new technology, using iPSCs or ESCs that are not capable of contributing to extraembryonic tissues. Using recently established culture conditions with a combination of signaling inhibitors (Buehr et al., 2008Buehr M. Meek S. Blair K. Yang J. Ure J. Silva J. McLay R. Hall J. Ying Q.L. Smith A.

The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar), we generated rat-ESCs and -iPSCs (rESCs, riPSCs). Our work has now confirmed the existence of interspecific chimeras generated with PSCs, using injection not only of mouse PSCs into rat embryos but also of rat PSCs into mouse embryos. Finally, by combining the principle of blastocyst complementation with the production of interspecific chimeras, we succeeded in generating rat pancreas in Pdx1−/− mice. These sets of experiments provide proof-of-principle data for donor iPSC-derived organ generation in a xenogenic environment. Our first goal was to generate pancreas from mPSCs. We performed a blastocyst complementation experiment using Pdx1−/− blastocysts that would provide a niche for pancreatic organogenesis. These mice exhibit pancreatic agenesis due to the absence of Pdx1-specified interactions between prepancreatic epithelium and mesenchyme, a key step in pancreatic development. Homozygote Pdx1-LacZ knockin mice (Pdx1−/−) are born alive but die within 1 week after birth, presumably due to pancreatic insufficiency (Offield et al., 1996Offield M.F. Jetton T.L. Labosky P.A. Ray M. Stein R.W. Magnuson M.A. Hogan B.L. Wright C.V. PDX-1 is required for pancreatic outgrowth and differentiation of the rostral duodenum.Development. 1996; 122: 983-995Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For complementation donor cells, we used GT3.2 mouse iPSCs (miPSCs) that had been generated from tail tip fibroblasts (TTFs) of an adult EGFP-transgenic (TG) C57BL/6 mouse (Okabe et al., 1997Okabe M. Ikawa M. Kominami K. Nakanishi T. Nishimune Y. ‘Green mice’ as a source of ubiquitous green cells.FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 313-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar) using three factors (Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4) in retroviral vectors (Figure S1 available online). These GT3.2 miPSCs were injected into blastocysts obtained by an intercross of heterozygote Pdx1-LacZ knockin mice (Pdx1+/−), offspring of C57BL/6(Pdx1+/−) × DBA(Pdx1+/+) or C57BL/6(Pdx1+/−) × BDF1(Pdx+/+) mice. G4.2 mESCs were also injected for comparison. Neonates were assessed macroscopically and histologically for pancreatic development and were genotyped for Pdx1. These neonates were highly chimeric: Due to silencing of EGFP and to contamination by donor cells, accurate determination of the genotypes required analysis at the single-cell level. To identify the genotypes of these neonates accurately, EGFP-negative, c-Kit-positive, and Sca1-positive, lineage marker-negative (EGFP−KSL) bone marrow cells were clone-sorted by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to obtain single-cell-derived hematopoietic colonies (Figure S2A ). After culture for 2 weeks, cells collected from each colony were subjected to PCR analysis (Figure S2B). This “colony PCR” method unambiguously determined the host embryo genotype and proved that pancreas had been formed in Pdx1−/− mice by blastocyst complementation (Figure S2C).Figure S2Genotyping for Identifying Pdx1 Status by Colony PCR, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) FACS analysis of bone marrow cells.

In all postnatal chimeric mice derived from blastocysts injected with either miPSCs or mESCs, pancreas was present regardless of host genotype (including Pdx1−/−). As expected, the pancreas in Pdx1+/− or Pdx1+/+ chimeric mice was a composite of host-derived cells and EGFP-miPSC- or mESC-derived cells, as in whole-body chimerism (Pdx1+/− + miPSCs or mESCs in Figure 1A ). In contrast, the pancreatic epithelium in Pdx1−/− chimeric mice was almost entirely composed of EGFP-marked miPSC- or mESC-derived cells (Pdx1−/− + miPSCs or mESCs in Figure 1A). The pancreas of these mice was grossly and histologically normal. We examined these pancreatic tissues further for contributions of donor mPSCs to different pancreatic lineages. Both miPSCs and mESCs supplied all pancreatic cell lineages (exocrine and endocrine tissues, including ductal epithelia), but pancreatic stromal elements—vessels, nerves, and fibrocytes—were composites of host- and mPSC-derived cells in all mice (Figure 1B). We next addressed whether mPSCs can rescue Pdx1−/− lethality via blastocyst complementation. As we predicted based on neonatal analysis (Figure 1), both mESCs and miPSCs contributed to pancreatic organogenesis; Pdx1−/− chimeric mice survived to adulthood (mESCs injection: n = 4, miPSCs injection: n = 15 in Figure 2A ). They even served as Pdx1−/− founders, transmitting their genotype to the next generation. Mating Pdx1−/− founder male mice with Pdx1+/− female mice increased to 50% the proportion of pups of homozygously disrupted genotype (Figure 2A). These data indicate that blastocyst complementation can be used to generate a functional organ and to yield homozygous founder mice even when uncomplemented homozygosity is fatal. The method described here thus can be useful for efficient production of gene-targeted mice that are embryonic lethal without introducing a conditional gene targeting system. As expected, in both Pdx1−/− and Pdx1+/ − mice injected with EGFP-miPSC, miPSC-derived cells contributed to all the nonpancreatic tissues of the body, including lung, heart, liver, muscle, testis, and brain (data not shown). The extent of contribution varied from tissue to tissue and also varied depending on individual chimera. However, the pancreas in adult Pdx1−/− mice was entirely derived from donor miPSCs (Pdx1−/− in Figure 2B). Detailed analysis of EGFP distributions in adult miPSC-derived pancreas demonstrated that pancreatic islets, exocrine tissues, and duct epithelia were entirely derived from donor miPSCs, as already shown in neonates (Pdx1−/− in Figures 2C and 2D). In expected contrast, pancreas from Pdx1+/− mice was a composite of host and donor derivatives (Pdx1+/− in Figures 2B and 2C). Quantitative analysis of these sections by image J software revealed percentages of EGFP-positive cells to be 27.4% ± 27.8% in the miPSC + Pdx1+/− setting, 95.6% ± 4.6% in the miPSC + Pdx1−/− setting. Of note is that most individual islets were composed of both host-derived and miPSC-derived cells (Pdx1+/− in Figure 2D), indicating, as previously reported (Deltour et al., 1991Deltour L. Leduque P. Paldi A. Ripoche M.A. Dubois P. Jami J. Polyclonal origin of pancreatic islets in aggregation mouse chimaeras.Development. 1991; 112: 1115-1121PubMed Google Scholar), nonclonal origin of pancreatic islets. To test whether miPSC-derived pancreata are functional in Pdx1−/− chimeric mice, we performed glucose tolerance testing (GTT). Whereas streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice failed to respond to GTT, Pdx1−/− chimeric mice responded well, indicating that Pdx1−/− mice with miPSC-derived pancreas secreted insulin in response to glucose loading and maintained normal serum glucose levels (Figure 2E). Histology and function of exogenously derived pancreas were essentially the same for mice derived from miPSC- and from mESC-complemented blastocysts (Figure S3). These data demonstrate that the vacant “pancreatic niche” provided in Pdx1−/− mice can be occupied, with developmental compensation, by miPSC- or mESC-derived cells after intraspecific blastocyst complementation, generating functionally intact pancreas. To assess the functionality of miPSC-derived pancreas, islets from miPSC-derived pancreas were transplanted into mice of the original strain (C57BL/6) in which STZ administration had induced diabetes. As a control, islets from pancreas in Pdx1+/− chimeric mice injected with miPSCs were transplanted. Blastocysts were obtained by an intercross of Pdx1+/− mice (C57BL/6 × DBA2 or C57BL/6 × BDF1 F1 strains) that were semi-allogenic to miPSCs used in this study. EGFP-expressing miPSC-derived islets (Figure 3A ) were isolated conventionally based on a method developed previously (Gotoh et al., 1985Gotoh M. Maki T. Kiyoizumi T. Satomi S. Monaco A.P. An improved method for isolation of mouse pancreatic islets.Transplantation. 1985; 40: 437-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) and were transplanted beneath the renal capsule of recipient mice. Nonfasting blood glucose levels were then monitored. As these islets were of donor origin (i.e., C57BL/6 strain), an immunosuppressive regimen was not used. To prevent nonspecific loss of islets due to inflammation, anti-inflammatory cytokine monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktails were given at transplantation and 2 and 4 days thereafter (arrows, Figure 3E), as described (Satoh et al., 2007Satoh M. Yasunami Y. Matsuoka N. Nakano M. Itoh T. Nitta T. Anzai K. Ono J. Taniguchi M. Ikeda S. Successful islet transplantation to two recipients from a single donor by targeting proinflammatory cytokines in mice.Transplantation. 2007; 83: 1085-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Two months after transplant, EGFP-expressing miPSC-derived islets were still detectable at the graft site (Figures 3B and 3C). Production of insulin by the transplanted islets was confirmed immunohistologically (Figure 3D). The induced-diabetic recipients no longer exhibited hyperglycemia; they maintained normal blood glucose levels and responded normally to GTT (Figures 3E and 3F). This is in contrast to the therapeutic effect conferred by islets, composites of blastocyst- and miPSC-derived cells, obtained from pancreas of Pdx1+/− chimeric mice (C57BL/6 × DBA2 or C57BL/6 × BDF1 F1 origin). This effect lasted only for a short time, presumably due to immune rejection by the host C57BL/6 diabetic mice (Figure 3E). These data strongly indicate that the miPSC-derived pancreas, with islets, formed in an allogenic host is functional and that the “autologous” islets thus formed can be used to treat diabetes, without rejection. Blastocyst complementation thus permits demonstration of proof-of-principle both for pancreas generation from PSCs and for diabetic therapy using donor iPSC-derived syngenic islets. Our second goal was to generate interspecific chimeras between mouse and rat. To achieve this goal, we generated not only miPSCs but also riPSCs and rESCs using an established protocol (Hirabayashi et al., 2009Hirabayashi M. Kato M. Kobayashi T. Sanbo M. Yagi T. Hochi S. Nakauchi H. Establishment of rat embryonic stem cell lines that can participate in germline chimeras at high efficiency.Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2009; 77: 94Google Scholar, Ying et al., 2008Ying Q.L.

The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2313) Google Scholar). These mouse and rat PSCs enabled us bidirectionally to generate interspecific chimeras. We injected EGFP-marked GT3.2 miPSCs into rat blastocysts (r-blastocysts) or EGFP-marked riPSCs (Figures S4A and S4B ) into mouse blastocysts (m-blastocysts). Because post-implantation development reportedly is severely hampered after intrauterine transfer of xenogenic blastocysts (Rossant et al., 1982Rossant J. Mauro V.M. Croy B.A. Importance of trophoblast genotype for survival of interspecific murine chimaeras.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1982; 69: 141-149PubMed Google Scholar, Tarkowski, 1962Tarkowski A.K. Inter-specific transfers of eggs between rat and mouse.J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1962; 10: 476-495PubMed Google Scholar), injected r-blastocysts or m-blastocysts were transferred, respectively, into the uteri of pseudopregnant rats or mice. After intrauterine transfer of injected r-blastocysts or m-blastocysts with development to the fetal stage, we evaluated EGFP expression by fluorescence microscopy for each transferred embryo. EGFP-expressing cells were found in the body of each injected conceptus, but never in placenta (Figure 4A ). This finding indicates that injected mouse or rat iPSCs can contribute to xenogenic development, with generation of interspecific chimeras.Figure 4Generation of Interspecific Chimeras between Mouse and RatShow full caption(A) Interspecific chimera fetuses generated by injection of miPSCs into r-blastocyst (rBL: left panels) and by injection of riPSCs into m-blastocyst (mBL: right panels).

Genomic analyses reveal how this revolutionary signaling system may have originated and why it rapidly became critical to metazoans. Tyrosine phosphorylation controls many cellular functions. Yet the three-part toolkit that regulates phosphotyrosine signaling—tyrosine kinases, phosphotyrosine phosphatases, and Src Homology 2 (SH2) domains—is a relatively new innovation. Genomic analyses reveal how this revolutionary signaling system may have originated and why it rapidly became critical to metazoans. Throughout human history, new technologies and technological platforms have constantly been invented. Only a small fraction of these technologies go on to be widely adopted, but these can ultimately have transformational consequences. In the evolutionary history of living organisms, we know that innovative molecular systems have appeared at key points in time, and these are thought to have played a transformative role in major evolutionary transitions in the tree of life. But how do such innovative molecular systems emerge, and how and why do some proliferate and become stably adopted by subsequent lineages? An example of such an innovative molecular system is phosphotyrosine (pTyr)-based signal transduction. This molecular system for transmitting cellular regulatory information is estimated to have appeared relatively recently in the history of life—∼600 million years ago, just prior to the emergence of multicellular animals (King et al., 2003King N. Hittinger C.T. Carroll S.B. Science. 2003; 301: 361-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, Pincus et al., 2008Pincus D. Letunic I. Bork P. Lim W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

USA. 2008; 105: 9674-9679Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The pTyr signaling system has become an essential part of metazoan biology. For example, pTyr signaling plays a central role in many cell-to-cell communication pathways, including those that regulate proliferation, differentiation, adhesion, hormone responses, and immune defense (Hunter, 2009Hunter T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). In modern metazoans, pTyr signaling is mediated by a toolkit of three distinct functional modules: tyrosine kinases (TyrK) phosphorylate specific target tyrosine residues, phosphotyrosine phosphatases (PTP) remove the phosphates, and Src Homology 2 (SH2) domains recognize the modifications (Pawson, 1995Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar). Together, these three modules form the “writer,” “eraser,” and “reader” toolkit that is common to many diverse cellular information processing platforms (Figure 1A ). A rich array of diverse and complex regulatory schemes can be achieved through the dynamic interplay of these three modular functions (Pawson et al., 1993Pawson T. Olivier P. Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Henkemeyer M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1993; 340: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, Pawson, 1995Pawson T.

A combination of these modules can lead to higher-order functions (Figure 1B). For example, there are several proteins containing a combination of SH2 and kinase domains that can generate positive feedback (phosphorylation of tyrosine sites leads to SH2-mediated recruitment of the kinase, and subsequently, more extensive phosphorylation) (Pawson, 2004Pawson T. Cell. 2004; 116: 191-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Similarly SH2-phosphatase domain combinations can generate negative feedback (Tonks and Neel, 2001Tonks N.K. Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The three-part pTyr signaling toolkit thus raises a classic question in evolutionary biology: how do complex, interdependent systems arise? It is clear why a new system encompassing a writer, eraser, and reader might be extremely useful. But, given their interdependence, how could these individual components arise in a stepwise fashion consistent with an evolutionary process? Proteins that bind or remove a posttranslational modification would seem useless without an enzyme to generate the modification and, in principle, would not provide a fitness advantage leading to its retention and spread. The pTyr signaling platform provides a case study to look for plausible stepwise pathways of the evolution of a multipart system. Here, we reconstruct a possible history for the evolution of pTyr signaling. This reconstruction is based on the recent sequencing of the genomes of a number of organisms that originated both before and after the emergence of metazoans from single-celled eukaryotic ancestors (King et al., 2008King N. Westbrook M.J. Young S.L. Kuo A. Abedin M. Chapman J. Fairclough S. Hellsten U. Isogai Y. Letunic I. et al.Nature. 2008; 451: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). The genome sequence of the choanoflagellate, Monosiga brevicollis, has been particularly illuminating as choanoflagellates are thought to be one of the closest single-celled relatives of metazoans. We present a model for how this three-part signaling system could have plausibly evolved in a stepwise manner. We propose that once the complete three-part system was in place, it may have rapidly taken hold in subsequent lineages because it could generate new regulatory behaviors without significant cross-interference with existing regulatory circuits. We also discuss the possible role of this new communication system in facilitating the transformative evolutionary shift to multicellularity. Given the incomplete record, however, such an evolutionary reconstruction is highly speculative. For example, we cannot rule out more complex paths involving cycles of evolutionary gain and loss of components, nor the possibility that similar components in distinct lineages have independent origins. Nonetheless, this model may provide a useful framework for focusing studies of pTyr signaling origins and the origins of analogous multicomponent signaling platforms. We describe three possible stages in the emergence of the modern pTyr signaling toolkit, each represented by an extant model organism (Figure 2). These stages are representative; we do not claim to define the exact path of evolution, but rather focus on identifying the dominant classes of stable intermediates that can exist in the broader evolutionary landscape. What came first, TyrK, PTP, or SH2 domains? Sequence analysis suggests that it was PTP domains. The genome of a simple single-celled eukaryote like the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae shows no TyrK proteins and one proto-SH2 domain, but a handful of PTP proteins (Pincus et al., 2008Pincus D. Letunic I. Bork P. Lim W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 9680-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (Figure 2, Stage 1). Most fungi have no more than five PTP proteins, and several of these have tyrosine phosphatase activity. We refer to the single putative “SH2” domain in yeast, found within the gene Spt6, as a proto-SH2 domain because it does not show pTyr binding (the domain has been reported to show phospho-Ser/Thr binding; Dengl et al., 2009Dengl S. Mayer A. Sun M. Cramer P. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 389: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, functionally, it cannot be considered a “reader” domain that is part of a pTyr regulatory system. These observations suggest a simple model: the first step in the evolution of the three-part pTyr signaling machinery was likely to have been the emergence of a functional tyrosine phosphatase. But why would PTPs arise in the pre-tyrosine kinase world? What functional use and fitness advantage would this eraser domain provide in organisms lacking a writer domain? The answer may lie in the fact that some Ser/Thr kinase domains, which are more ancient than tyrosine kinases (dating back close to the origins of eukaryotes), can carry out sporadic but functionally important phosphorylation of tyrosines. Phosphoamino acid analysis of yeast reveals a small but significant population of pTyr (Schieven et al., 1986Schieven G. Thorner J. Martin G.S. Science. 1986; 231: 390-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, certain events, such as the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and inhibition of the cell-cycle kinase Cdk1, are known to involve phosphorylation of tyrosine residues (for activation, a MAPK must be phosphorylated by an upstream Ser/Thr kinase on both a Thr and Tyr residue within its activation loop; Cdk1 is phosphorylated on Tyr14 by the inhibitory kinase Wee1). These tyrosine modifications are clearly not recognized by SH2 domains, but they exert direct allosteric effects within the proteins in which they occur. Thus, PTP domains may have provided a fitness benefit by negatively modulating these rare but functionally important phosphorylation events. Consistent with this model, the proteins PTP2 and PTP3 in yeast clearly have a functionally important role in downregulating MAPK-mediated signaling in response to pheromones or osmolarity changes, explaining their fitness benefit (Pincus et al., 2008Pincus D. Letunic I. Bork P. Lim W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 9680-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In addition, PTPs may have played a general role buffering against the occasional harmful stray phosphorylation of functionally important tyrosines. Where did these PTPs come from? PTPs are likely to have arisen from a common ancestor of the related dual-specificity phosphatases, which are also found in most single-celled eukaryotes (Kennelly, 2001Kennelly P.J. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 2291-2312Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, Alonso et al., 2004Alonso A. Sasin J. Bottini N. Friedberg I. Friedberg I. Osterman A. Godzik A. Hunter T. Dixon J. Mustelin T. Cell. 2004; 117: 699-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). Dual-specificity phosphatases are catalytic domains that can dephosphorylate both pSer/Thr and pTyr substrates. The PTP and dual-specificity phosphatase catalytic domains are distinct but are evolutionarily related. They share a common fold and the core catalytic motif HC(X)5R, in which a phosphocysteine enzyme intermediate is generated during catalysis. (Sometimes, both dual-specificity phosphatases and classical PTPs are referred to as PTPs; here, we use this nomenclature only for the classical PTP domains that act only on pTyr). The domains of dual-specificity phosphatases have a shallower active site than classical PTPs, which may explain why they can dephosphorylate either Tyr or Thr/Ser residues. In some lineages, dual-specificity phosphatases have functionally diverged further, giving rise to members that can act on lipid substrates, such as the phosphoinositide phosphatases PTEN and the myotubularins (Alonso et al., 2004Alonso A. Sasin J. Bottini N. Friedberg I. Friedberg I. Osterman A. Godzik A. Hunter T. Dixon J. Mustelin T. Cell. 2004; 117: 699-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). Thus, the PTPs appear to have arisen from a somewhat promiscuous class of multifunctional phosphatases. Despite the presence of PTP proteins in fungi, there are striking differences between these proteins and those found in metazoans (Figure 2). For example, there are far fewer PTPs in fungi (∼5/genome versus ∼40/genome in metazoans) and they are considerably less complex in domain architecture (Pincus et al., 2008Pincus D. Letunic I. Bork P. Lim W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 9680-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Metazoan PTP proteins tend to be large multidomain proteins in which the PTP module has been functionally recombined with multiple other signaling modules. In contrast, in fungi, the PTP domains are all either in simple single-domain proteins or in combination with a single rhodanase-like domain (a putative regulatory domain that is homologous to a class of sulfur transfer enzymes; Bordo and Bork, 2002Bordo D. Bork P. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 741-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Thus, fungal PTP proteins are very simple (one to two domains) and lack the combinatorial complexity of metazoan PTP proteins. The simplicity and low number of PTPs in yeast suggests that in early single-celled eukaryotes, PTP domains had fairly limited functional utility, especially when compared to their broad and complex usage in metazoans. Unlike PTPs, there are no known pTyr-binding SH2 domains in fungi, although there is one clearly homologous domain found in the yeast protein SPT6. This protein, which has a domain with an SH2-like sequence and fold, is involved in the regulation of transcription elongation, and the SH2 domain binds to the Ser/Thr phosphorylated C-terminal tail of RNA polymerase II. The domain does not bind to pTyr (Dengl et al., 2009Dengl S. Mayer A. Sun M. Cramer P. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 389: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a single SPT6 ortholog, with the same overall domain architecture, is found in all eukaryotes, including all fungi and metazoans (but not prokaryotes). This finding suggests that in early eukaryotes, a proto-SH2 domain emerged to perform a highly specialized function—one that was unrelated to the flexible modular pTyr recognition function of the modern SH2 domain. This proto-SH2 domain most likely did not “read” pTyr modifications, but instead recognized a specialized related modification. Thus, although SPT6 is likely to represent an early ancestor or relative that eventually gave rise to modern SH2 domains, it cannot be considered a functional part of a pTyr regulatory toolkit. We therefore postulate that early eukaryotes had only a pTyr eraser function (mediated by PTPs) with no specialized complementary reader or writer functions. In summary, the PTP domain and a structural ancestor of the SH2 domain appear to have arisen in early single-celled eukaryotes, but are likely to have functional origins that are not directly related to their later function in modern pTyr regulatory systems. These components may have provided a limited but incremental fitness advantage, even in the absence of a specialized tyrosine kinase domain. In the early days of a more sophisticated pTyr-signaling system, we suggest that a proto-SH2 domain (mostly likely a homolog of the yeast Spt6 protein) in a single-celled organism acquired the new and functionally beneficial ability to bind to pTyr-containing peptide motifs. The slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum has the simplest repertoire of bona fide pTyr-binding SH2 domains and may therefore provide a living representative of this second evolutionary stage (Figure 2, Stage 2). Dictyostelium is a soil-living amoeba that has a unicellular lifestyle in the presence of bacterial food. However, when food is depleted, individual cells aggregate in response to the chemoattractant cAMP to form a multicellular structure, which then develops into a fruiting body through the differentiation of stalk and spore cells. The rudimentary pTyr-SH2 system in Dictyostelium is important for aspects of this differentiation process, including intracellular responses to both cAMP and the morphogen differentiation inducing factor or DIF (which induces the differentiation of prestalk cells), as well as for transcriptional regulation in response to hyperosmotic stress. These observations are consistent with early pTyr-SH2 signaling playing a role in cellular responses to changing environmental conditions. The Dictyostelium genome specifies 13 proteins with SH2 domains (as well as a single Spt6 homolog). These 13 proteins cluster into five basic domain architectures, two of which are homologous to metazoan SH2 proteins. Notably, Dictyostelium has four STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) proteins that are very similar to metazoan STAT transcription factors (Kay, 1997Kay R.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R723-R725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, Kawata et al., 1997Kawata T. Shevchenko A. Fukuzawa M. Jermyn K.A. Totty N.F. Zhukovskaya N.V. Sterling A.E. Mann M. Williams J.G. Cell. 1997; 89: 909-916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). For example, they all have an SH2 domain juxtaposed to a DNA-binding region; they are inducibly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in response to stress or the extracellular signaling molecule DIF; they undergo pTyr/SH2-mediated dimerization and then translocate to the nucleus to regulate the expression of specific genes. Dictyostelium also has an ortholog of the mammalian E3 ubiquitin ligase Cbl, which uses SH2 and Ring domains to couple pTyr signals to the ubiquitination machinery (Langenick et al., 2008Langenick J. Araki T. Yamada Y. Williams J.G. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3524-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The remaining three domain architectures of Dictyostelium SH2 proteins are distinct from those found in other sequenced organisms. The LrrB protein has an SH2 domain linked to a leucine-rich repeat domain (Sugden et al., 2010Sugden C. Ross S. Bloomfield G. Ivens A. Skelton J. Mueller-Taubenberger A. Williams J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 22927-22935Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), whereas the FbxB protein has an F-box followed by an SH2 domain and ankyrin repeats. In addition, the Shk proteins have a protein kinase domain followed by an SH2 domain, a domain combination that is somewhat similar to metazoan cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases like Src (Moniakis et al., 2001Moniakis J. Funamoto S. Fukuzawa M. Meisenhelder J. Araki T. Abe T. Meili R. Hunter T. Williams J. Firtel R.A. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The Shk catalytic domain, however, lacks motifs characteristic of bona fide tyrosine kinases and biochemically displays dual specificity toward serine/threonine and tyrosine residues. Indeed, Dictyostelium differs from metazoans and choanoflagellates in that its genome does not encode any modern tyrosine-specific protein kinases. For example, metazoan STAT proteins are usually phosphorylated by Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs), but there are no JAKs in Dictyostelium (Kay, 1997Kay R.R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: R723-R725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility that signaling proteins containing SH2 domains such as STATs evolved before the modern tyrosine kinases with which they are associated in metazoans. The identity of the kinase responsible for STAT tyrosine phosphorylation, and the consequent formation of SH2-binding sites, remains mysterious. How, then, is tyrosine phosphorylation of Dictyostelium proteins such as the STATs controlled? Thus far, genetic analysis has not identified a specific relevant kinase, and it has been proposed that, in contrast to mammalian STATs, there may be basal constitutive phosphorylation of Dictyostelium STAT tyrosine sites, which is regulated by changes in PTP activity in response to extracellular signals (Langenick et al., 2008Langenick J. Araki T. Yamada Y. Williams J.G. J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 3524-3530Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). One of the PTPs in Dictyostelium, PTP3, binds and dephosphorylates STATc, thereby blocking SH2-mediated dimerization and STATc accumulation in the nucleus. Signaling induced by the DIF morphogen appears to transmit signals by inhibiting PTP3 activity and consequently boosting STATc tyrosine phosphorylation and STATc-dependent gene expression. Although Dictyostelium lacks true tyrosine kinases, it is noteworthy that its genome has a significant expansion in the number of putative dual-specificity protein kinases (there are ∼70, also known as tyrosine kinase-like or TKL kinases) (Manning et al., 2008Manning G. Young S.L. Miller W.T. Zhai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 9674-9679Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). This set includes the Shk catalytic domain, described above. It is unlikely that any of these kinases are precursors of modern tyrosine kinases. However, it is plausible that these represent the first evolutionary form of the “writer” function in a prototype pTyr three-part regulatory system. The union of an SH2 domain and a dual specificity kinase domain, as found in the Shk proteins, may be an early example of linking “reader” and “writer” modules to achieve more complex functions such as positive feedback. Nonetheless, the limited functionality of the dual specificity kinases in carrying out tyrosine phosphorylation may have limited the capabilities of this early system. This may explain the very modest expansion of pTyr signaling in organisms such as Dictyostelium. These observations paint the following picture of Dictyostelium pTyr signaling and, by extension, of an early phase in the evolution of pTyr communication. SH2 domains have acquired pTyr-binding activity and are found in several distinct combinations with other types of signaling domains. Among these, the STAT and Cbl proteins are shared with metazoans, whereas the LrrB, FbxB, and Shk proteins are unique to Dictyostelium. But no dedicated modern tyrosine kinases have been found, and the dynamic control of tyrosine phosphorylation may be primarily regulated by PTPs. Although functionally important for aggregation and differentiation, the pTyr signaling system has not acquired the pervasive influence evident in M. brevicollis and metazoans, perhaps because of the lack of an efficient tyrosine kinase. Put another way, Dicytostelium has effective pTyr readers and erasers, but the writer is poorly developed. Current analysis suggests that the modern tyrosine kinases arose just prior to the evolution of the metazoans. Aside from metazoans, canonical tyrosine kinases have thus far only been observed in the choanoflagellates, which appear to be the closest known single-celled relatives of metazoans (King et al., 2008King N. Westbrook M.J. Young S.L. Kuo A. Abedin M. Chapman J. Fairclough S. Hellsten U. Isogai Y. Letunic I. et al.Nature. 2008; 451: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). The absence of significant numbers of such tyrosine kinases in any other branch of life suggests that this new catalytic domain evolved in a recent common ancestor of choanoflagellates and metazoans, most likely as a branch of the older Ser/Thr kinases. Some bacteria do have specialized tyrosine kinases (BY kinases), but these resemble P loop NTPases (nucleotide triphosphatases) and are structurally unrelated to eukaryotic tyrosine kinases (Lee and Jia, 2009Lee D.C. Jia Z. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 351-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It is therefore probable that BY kinases evolved separately from metazoan tyrosine kinases and operate in a different fashion. The new eukaryotic tyrosine kinase domain appears to have been a game changing innovation (Figure 2, Stage 3). The total number of tyrosine kinase proteins in both choanoflagellate and metazoan species is in the range of 30–150 per genome (Pincus et al., 2008Pincus D. Letunic I. Bork P. Lim W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 9680-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, Manning et al., 2008Manning G. Young S.L. Miller W.T. Zhai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 9674-9679Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Among sequenced genomes, there is a striking absence of species with only a small number of TyrK proteins. This all-or-none sudden jump in the number of TyrK proteins suggests their importance as they appear to have undergone rapid expansion and subsequent retention. What is perhaps more striking is the observation that the emergence of the TyrK domain and its rapid expansion correlates with an equally rapid expansion of PTP and SH2 domains within the same genomes (Pincus et al., 2008Pincus D. Letunic I. Bork P. Lim W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 9680-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although fungi and Dictyostelium have ∼5 PTP proteins, metazoans, and choanoflagellates have 30–40 per genome. Similarly, Dictyostelium has approximately ten SH2 domain-containing proteins (fungi have none), whereas metazoans and choanoflagellates have ∼100 each. Thus, both PTP and SH2 proteins undergo a roughly 10-fold increase in number per genome after the emergence of the TyrK domain. Moreover, the proteins containing SH2 and PTP domains become far more complex and varied (Jin et al., 2009Jin J. Xie X. Chen C. Park J.G. Stark C. James D.A. Olhovsky M. Linding R. Mao Y. Pawson T. Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: ra76Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For example, in yeast and Dictyostelium, SH2 and PTP proteins normally are very simple one or two domain proteins. However, in lineages that have modern TyrK proteins, SH2 and PTP proteins almost always comprise three to ten domains. These observations are consistent with the following model. When a far more efficient TyrK domain—or “writer” function—emerged, this dramatically increased the functional utility of the pre-existing PTP (eraser) and SH2 (reader) domains. As a three-part toolkit—a catalytic domain to generate pTyr, an interaction domain to bind to these pTyr sites, and an enzyme to dephosphorylate them—this domain set could be used to encode and execute a far wider and diverse range of regulatory functions, thus leading to the subsequent expansion of the complete set. Although the PTP and SH2 domains had utility in simpler organisms, their much larger functional potential was not unleashed until the emergence of the TyrK domain. The rapid expansion of the pTyr signaling machinery in the ancestors of choanoflagellates and animals is reminiscent of how technology expands in quantum jumps, especially in situations involving codependent technologies. For example, the value of the laser expanded dramatically after the later invention of the complementary technology of fiber optics. This codependent technology allowed lasers to be repurposed to rapidly displace electrical transmission via copper wires as the backbone of global communication (Alwayn, 2004Alwayn V. Optical Network Design and Implementation. Cisco Press, Indianapolis, IN2004Google Scholar). Thus, although lasers had standalone utility, their major application had to await the introduction of complementary technology. The expansion of molecular components in biology is likely to be similar. A toolkit of writer, reader, and eraser functions may be of full use only when all components are present. Thus, it may be common for any system of this type to show a quantum “all-or-none” expansion only when the final piece of the toolkit emerges. Although both choanoflagellate and metazoan lineages show a large expansion of the three-part pTyr regulatory machinery, the way in which these components are used appears to be quite different. When one examines the domain types that co-occur with TyrK, SH2, or PTP domains, one finds many distinct combinations that are unique to each lineage (Pincus et al., 2008Pincus D. Letunic I. Bork P. Lim W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 9680-9684Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, Manning et al., 2008Manning G. Young S.L. Miller W.T. Zhai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 9674-9679Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These differences in domain combinations imply distinct functions for proteins containing these domains in the choanoflagellate and metazoan lineages (Li et al., 2009Li W. Scarlata S. Miller W.T. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 5180-5186Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Assuming that the evolution of new TyrK, SH2, and PTP proteins occurred by recombination with new accessory domains (Jin et al., 2009Jin J. Xie X. Chen C. Park J.G. Stark C. James D.A. Olhovsky M. Linding R. Mao Y. Pawson T. Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: ra76Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, Peisajovich et al., 2010Peisajovich S.G. Garbarino J.E. Wei P. Lim W.A. Science. 2010; 328: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), this observation also implies that the complete signaling toolkit emerged only shortly before the divergence of metazoans and choanoflagellates (i.e., shortly before the evolution of metazoan multicellularity) and that much of the divergent expansion of these domain families occurred after the lineage split. Thus, earlier assumptions that pTyr signaling is only used in metazoan cell-cell communication are clearly incorrect. Choanoflagellates do not form the complex and permanent cell-cell organization that metazoans do, yet surprisingly they have a comparable (if not greater) number of pTyr signaling proteins (Manning et al., 2008Manning G. Young S.L. Miller W.T. Zhai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 9674-9679Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Sequencing of other organisms that arose near the origins of metazoans is ongoing. Preliminary data also suggest a large number of pTyr signaling proteins in other single-celled relatives of metazoans. Thus, it may be more reasonable to view the pTyr signaling system as an innovative but generic information processing system that could potentially be used for transmitting many different types of information. When the three-part pTyr system first emerged, it presented a new platform with which to transmit information that was orthogonal to pre-existing signaling systems. Because it was based on a distinct covalent modification, new regulatory circuits could be assembled with these components without significant cross-interference with pre-existing networks. Thus, this brand new signaling apparatus probably had a high encoding potential for evolving dramatically new functions, such as those involved in multicellularity. One possible problem that could be caused by the expansion of the new pTyr signaling enzymes might be excessive general phosphorylation of tyrosine residues throughout the proteome. Interestingly, however, organisms using pTyr signaling may have developed a simple solution to deal with this problem—a decrease in the tyrosine content of proteins across the proteome is observed to correlate with tyrosine kinase expansion (Tan et al., 2009Tan C.S. Pasculescu A. Lim W.A. Pawson T. Bader G.D. Linding R. Science. 2009; 325: 1686-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). A new orthogonal signaling system like the pTyr signaling platform can be viewed as analogous to a newly opened region in the telecommunications spectrum. New frequencies provide the opportunity for transmitting large amounts of information as there is little interference from existing communication. Because of this valuable high encoding potential, there is extreme pressure to quickly fill this region of the spectrum. Moreover, the exact type of information carried by each region of the spectrum is flexible—for example, the same region of the spectrum can be assigned to different functions in different countries. We hypothesize that the new pTyr signaling system that emerged prior to metazoans presented similar new opportunities to transmit more information. This virgin system was rapidly exploited, though the way it has been used appears to be different in the two branches (metazoans and choanoflagellates) that emerged after the complete toolkit was established. It is tempting to speculate that the emergence of a new signaling system with high encoding potential may have played a key role in the emergence of a new, complex biological function such as metazoan multicellularity. Such large-scale phenotypic evolutionary innovations may require and coincide with innovations in basic molecular components (King, 2004King N. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 313-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, Rokas, 2008Rokas A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 235-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Indeed, we speculate that pTyr signaling may provide a more general model for the generation of multicomponent biological systems, involving first a limited stepwise development of elements that together have a rudimentary biological utility, followed by an explosive spread, once all of the components of the mature system are in place. Exploration of this concept, and further analysis of the evolution of pTyr signaling, will be assisted by the increasing sequence information being gathered for both unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes (Srivastava et al., 2010Srivastava M. Simakov O. Chapman J. Fahey B. Gauthier M.E. Mitros T. Richards G.S. Conaco C. Dacre M. Hellsten U. et al.Nature. 2010; 466: 720-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar), which will no doubt yield surprises akin to the discovery of extensive pTyr signaling in M. brevicollis. Moreover, as genomic information bracketing other major evolutionary transitions becomes available, it will be interesting to see whether these innovations are also associated with the explosive expansion of new molecular toolkits. A key point here is that the specific emergence of the pTyr toolkit may not have been essential for the evolution of multicellularity, but rather, any number of new orthogonal signaling toolkits with the same high encoding potential could have served a similar role. Other analogous new molecular information currencies could have, in principle, been able to serve as the substrate for dramatic phenotypic innovation. In this context, plants make extensive use of protein phosphorylation and have numerous transmembrane receptor Ser/Thr kinases, but they lack conventional tyrosine kinases, indicating that pTyr-based signaling is not the only mechanism of information transfer through which organisms can achieve multicellularity. How close is the pTyr signaling system to being saturated? Is there still available encoding potential that could be tapped for the evolution of new pathways and behaviors? It is difficult to answer these questions. However, the fact that new pTyr signaling proteins appear to be associated with advanced processes like adaptive immunity suggests that there was still some remaining encoding potential in the system as late as the evolution of mammals. The evolutionary history reconstructed here begs many questions. Are there new regulatory toolkits evolving now or in the future? Will these new toolkits be the substrate required for the next big evolutionary innovation? The importance of new molecular toolkits is conversely also very relevant to the emerging field of synthetic biology, in which the goal is to engineer cellular systems with new functions. A major potential limitation is how to build such new functions in a reliable fashion that does not cross-interfere in unanticipated ways with existing systems (Lim, 2010Lim W.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Can we develop new synthetic molecular signaling currencies that are orthogonal to existing natural ones, and would these systems dramatically facilitate our ability to reliably and predictably endow cells with innovative new functions? Current data suggest that PTP and SH2 domains evolved before modern TyrK domains, most likely to process pTyr modifications sporadically catalyzed by Ser/Thr kinases. However, the PTP and SH2 domain protein families did not expand dramatically until the emergence of an efficient TyrK. We postulate that only with the complete toolkit of writer (TyrK), reader (SH2), and eraser (PTP) domains, was the full encoding potential of this system unleashed, leading to rapid expansion and elaboration of these domain families. This type of explosive increase in component usage may prove to be common to all multipart molecular systems. The emergence of the modern TyrK maps just prior to the split between metazoans and choanoflagellates. These two lineages appear to have used this new molecular communication system in distinct ways—multicellular metazoans used it for cell-cell coordination, whereas unicellular choanoflagellates used it for distinct but as yet uncharacterized functions."

Here, we have integrated quantitative proteomics with bioinformatic analysis to generate a series of independent classifiers that describe the approximately 4,000 proteins identified in isolated mitotic chromosomes. Integrating these classifiers by machine learning uncovers functional relationships between protein complexes in the context of intact chromosomes and reveals which of the approximately 560 uncharacterized proteins identified here merits further study. Indeed, of 34 GFP-tagged predicted chromosomal proteins, 30 were chromosomal, including 13 with centromere-association. Of 16 GFP-tagged predicted nonchromosomal proteins, 14 were confirmed to be nonchromosomal. An unbiased analysis of the whole chromosome proteome from genetic knockouts of kinetochore protein Ska3/Rama1 revealed that the APC/C and RanBP2/RanGAP1 complexes depend on the Ska complex for stable association with chromosomes. Our integrated analysis predicts that up to 97 new centromere-associated proteins remain to be discovered in our data set."

To elucidate its origins, we set out to identify related brain parts in phylogenetically distant animals, to then unravel common aspects in cellular composition and molecular architecture. Here, we compare vertebrate pallium development to that of the mushroom bodies, sensory-associative brain centers, in an annelid. Using a newly developed protocol for cellular profiling by image registration (PrImR), we obtain a high-resolution gene expression map for the developing annelid brain. Comparison to the vertebrate pallium reveals that the annelid mushroom bodies develop from similar molecular coordinates within a conserved overall molecular brain topology and that their development involves conserved patterning mechanisms and produces conserved neuron types that existed already in the protostome-deuterostome ancestors. These data indicate deep homology of pallium and mushroom bodies and date back the origin of higher brain centers to prebilaterian times."

The chronic inflammation that leads to tissue damage and organ dysfunction in COPD is mediated in large part by neutrophils, a type of granulocytic immune cell. Snelgrove et al. (p. 90 , published online 2 September; see the Perspective by Barnes ) now provide an explanation for why neutrophils stick around in the lung during COPD. The neutrophil chemoattractant Pro-Gly-Pro (PGP) is a biomarker for COPD and promotes neutrophil accumulation. The enzyme leukotriene A 4 hydrolase degrades PGP in mice, and its activity was reduced by cigarette smoke both in vivo and in vitro. In contrast, during acute influenza infection in mice, leukotriene A 4 hydrolase functioned normally, allowing for PGP degradation and the resolution of inflammation. Thus, in COPD, cigarette smoking may lead to the accumulation PGP—which, in turn, could keep neutrophils in the lung to drive inflammation and subsequent lung damage and dysfunction."

Therefore, small molecules that could reduce insulin dependence and regulate dyslipidemia could have a dramatic effect on public health. The grapefruit flavonoid naringenin has been shown to normalize lipids in diabetes and hypercholesterolemia, as well as inhibit the production of HCV. Here, we demonstrate that naringenin regulates the activity of nuclear receptors PPARalpha, PPARgamma, and LXRalpha. We show it activates the ligand-binding domain of both PPARalpha and PPARgamma, while inhibiting LXRalpha in GAL4-fusion reporters. Using TR-FRET, we show that naringenin is a partial agonist of LXRalpha, inhibiting its association with Trap220 co-activator in the presence of TO901317. In addition, naringenin induces the expression of PPARalpha co-activator, PGC1alpha. The flavonoid activates PPAR response element (PPRE) while suppressing LXRalpha response element (LXRE) in human hepatocytes, translating into the induction of PPAR-regulated fatty acid oxidation genes such as CYP4A11, ACOX, UCP1 and ApoAI, and inhibition of LXRalpha-regulated lipogenesis genes, such as FAS, ABCA1, ABCG1, and HMGR. This effect results in the induction of a fasted-like state in primary rat hepatocytes in which fatty acid oxidation increases, while cholesterol and bile acid production decreases. Our findings explain the myriad effects of naringenin and support its continued clinical development. Of note, this is the first description of a non-toxic, naturally occurring LXRalpha inhibitor."

To ensure robust undisturbed circadian oscillation, clock controlled transcription is in principal independent of light and compensated for temperature and other environmental stimuli. However, exogenous stimuli, such as light, are needed as resetting cues to synchronize the clock with the environmental cycles (Doyle and Menaker, 2007Doyle S. Menaker M.

Hence, circadian systems must be able to sense and properly interpret light intensity signals under a variety of natural conditions. Molecular mechanisms that allow circadian systems to respond reliably to natural photoperiods with noisy and ambiguous light intensity characteristics are not known. In nature, photoperiodic entrainment is further complicated by light reflected from the moon since the photoreceptors generally detect even low light levels (Bachleitner et al., 2007Bachleitner W.

The response of Neurospora to light is mediated by WHITE COLLAR-1 (WC-1) and VIVID (VVD). Together with WC-2, WC-1 forms the circadian transcription factor White Collar Complex (WCC), and VVD is expressed under control of light-activated WCC. WC-1 and VVD contain a flavin-binding light-oxygen-voltage (LOV) domain (He et al., 2002He Q. Cheng P. Yang Y. Wang L. Gardner K.H. Liu Y.

In particular, the molecular basis of light activation of WCC and adaptation by VVD is not known. VVD has a propensity to form rapidly exchanging dimers in response to light (Zoltowski and Crane, 2008Zoltowski B.D. Crane B.R. Light activation of the LOV protein vivid generates a rapidly exchanging dimer.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7012-7019Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), but the physiological relevance of the dynamic dimerization is obscure. Once activated by light, LOV domains cannot sense additional light cues. Spontaneous decay of the flavin-cysteinyl photoadduct resets the LOV domain to the dark state and restores its light-sensing capacity. The photoadduct of VVD is extremely stable (t1/2 ∼4.5 hr), but generally the kinetics of photoadduct decay varies from seconds to hours in different LOV domains (Corchnoy et al., 2003Corchnoy S.B.

The products of two of these genes, frequency (frq) and vvd, inhibit WCC in negative feedback loops (Brunner and Schafmeier, 2006Brunner M. Schafmeier T.

The clock protein FRQ inhibits WCC in a light-independent fashion and generates a daily rhythm of WCC activity that is essential for self-sustained circadian rhythms (Schafmeier et al., 2008Schafmeier T.

In contrast, VVD inhibits WCC in a light-dependent fashion, and the oscillating feedback loop dampens rapidly in constant darkness (Elvin et al., 2005Elvin M. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. Heintzen C.

VVD is not essential for clock function. Deletion of vvd has a mild circadian phenotype, resulting in a slight phase delay of the circadian clock (Heintzen et al., 2001Heintzen C. Loros J.J.

This raises a question about the physiologically relevant function of VVD. When dark-grown Neurospora is abruptly exposed to light, WCC-dependent transcript levels increase rapidly and adapt to a low steady state within 1–2 hr (Schwerdtfeger and Linden, 2001Schwerdtfeger C. Linden H. Blue light adaptation and desensitization of light signal transduction in Neurospora crassa.Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1080-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the photoadapted state, a second transcription spike can be evoked by increasing the light intensity (Schwerdtfeger and Linden, 2001Schwerdtfeger C. Linden H. Blue light adaptation and desensitization of light signal transduction in Neurospora crassa.Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1080-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Photoadaptation and light-sensing in the adapted state depend on VVD. In nature, mycelia growing deeply concealed behind the bark of a tree may receive the same light intensity level during the day as openly exposed mycelia receive by moonlight in the course of a clear night. How the photoreceptor system adapts to different light intensities and facilitates photoperiodic entrainment over a broad range of conditions (Tan et al., 2004Tan Y. Merrow M. Roenneberg T. Photoperiodism in Neurospora crassa.J. Biol. Rhythms. 2004; 19: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) is not known. In the present study, we elucidated the molecular mechanism of photoactivation and adaptation of WCC. We show that WCC and VVD form highly dynamic homo- and heterodimers via their activated LOV domains. In response to light, WCC initially forms homodimers that efficiently activate transcription of vvd. VVD accumulates with a delay after light induction and acts as a competitive inhibitor of WCC homodimerization, leading to an attenuation of light-induced transcription. Interaction with VVD protects light-activated WCC from rapid degradation and thus allows a sizable fraction of WCC to equilibrate with the WCC dark form. In the photoadapted state, VVD synthesis triggered by light-activated WCC is balanced by VVD-dependent inhibition of WCC. The VVD-mediated desensitization and stabilization of the light activated WCC explain on a molecular level how Neurospora can robustly entrain to artificial and natural photoperiods. To characterize the light-sensing system of Neurospora, we exposed dark-grown mycelia to increasing light intensities (5 μmol × m−2 × s−1 and 130 μmol × m−2 × s−1) for two consecutive 4 hr periods, and expression of vvd RNA was analyzed by qPCR (Figure 1A ). In dark-grown mycelia, vvd RNA could not be detected. After the mycelia were transferred to the light (5 μmol × m−2 × s−1), RNA levels increased rapidly, reached a peak after ∼20 min, and subsequently decreased to a lower steady-state level. When the light intensity was increased after 4 hr to 130 μmol × m−2 × s−1, a second spike of vvd RNA induction and adaptation was observed. The data confirm that Neurospora adapts to constant light but can still sense light in the adapted state (Schwerdtfeger and Linden, 2001Schwerdtfeger C. Linden H. Blue light adaptation and desensitization of light signal transduction in Neurospora crassa.Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1080-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, we noted that levels of vvd RNA in the adapted state were higher at the higher light intensity. To determine whether steady-state levels of vvd RNA correlate with the light intensity, we grew mycelia for 48 hr at a number of different light intensities, and vvd RNA was quantified. Surprisingly, vvd RNA levels correlated with light intensity over more than two orders of magnitude (Figure 1B). Above ∼130 μmol × m−2 × s−1, the light-dependent increase in transcript levels was less pronounced than at lower fluence levels, suggesting that the system approached saturation. VVD protein levels increased in a similar fashion (Figure 1C). Transcript levels of frq, al-2, and wc-1, which are also controlled by the WCC initially, also rise with increasing light intensity. However, light induction of these genes saturates readily and therefore does not reflect light intensities over a wide range (Figure S1A available online). At light intensities below 0.8 μmol × m−2 × s−1, vvd RNA and VVD protein levels were hardly above background and hence difficult to quantify. To address whether the Neurospora photoreceptor system can sense light of lower intensity, we examined entrainment to light cues of different intensities in the race-tube assay (Figure 1D). Entrainment of the conidiation rhythm of Neurospora to light:dark (LD) cycles depends strictly on functional WCC (Liu, 2003Liu Y. Molecular mechanisms of entrainment in the Neurospora circadian clock.J. Biol. Rhythms. 2003; 18: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Neurospora entrained to LD cycles with light intensities as low as 2.8 nmol × m−2 × s−1, the lowest level of light tested. Assuming that the molecular mechanism of light sensing and adaptation is the same at high and low light, the data suggest that the photoreceptors of Neurospora can discriminate light intensities over five orders of magnitude. (2.8 nmol × m−2 × s−1 to 750 μmol × m−2 × s−1). The molecular mechanism by which VVD attenuates the activity of the WCC is not known, and interaction partners of VVD have not been found. VVD might directly inhibit WCC in the nucleus or indirectly affect its activity via signaling molecules, such as kinases or phosphatases. To determine whether a nuclear pool of VVD could directly interfere with transcription activation by the WCC, we constructed a strain, Δvvd cpc-1-vvd-gfp, which constitutively expressed GFP-tagged VVD under control of the cpc-1 promoter. Expression of VVD-GFP suppressed the intense coloring of Δvvd mycelia and restored the wild-type (WT) phase of conidiation (not shown) suggesting that VVD-GFP was functional. Analysis of living mycelia by fluorescence microscopy revealed that VVD-GFP was located in the cytosol and nuclei but displayed slightly greater nuclear enrichment than GFP alone, which was uniformly distributed (Figure 1E). The observed nuclear localization of VVD-GFP appears to contradict previous reports that VVD was not detected in the nuclear fraction when mycelia were fractionated (Schwerdtfeger and Linden, 2003Schwerdtfeger C. Linden H. VIVID is a flavoprotein and serves as a fungal blue light photoreceptor for photoadaptation.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4846-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, VVD is a small protein (21 kDa) and might freely equilibrate between nuclei and cytosol. Hence, it might readily be lost from nuclei during fractionation. To address this issue, we fractionated mycelia that were untreated or treated with 1% formaldehyde to induce low levels of nonspecific crosslinking (Figure S1B). In untreated mycelia, VVD was found exclusively in the cytosolic fraction, in agreement with previous reports (Schwerdtfeger and Linden, 2003Schwerdtfeger C. Linden H. VIVID is a flavoprotein and serves as a fungal blue light photoreceptor for photoadaptation.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4846-4855Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In treated mycelia, a substantial portion of VVD was recovered in the nuclear fraction, in agreement with the localization of VVD-GFP in living mycelia. These data suggest that nuclear VVD is readily lost during subcellular fractionation procedures. VVD has been reported to form light-dependent dimers that are, however, highly unstable and dynamic (Zoltowski and Crane, 2008Zoltowski B.D. Crane B.R. Light activation of the LOV protein vivid generates a rapidly exchanging dimer.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 7012-7019Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We reasoned that WCC might dimerize in corresponding fashion via the LOV domain of WC-1 and that VVD could compete with this process by interacting with the LOV domain of WC-1. Attempts to coimmunoprecipitate light or dark states of VVD and WCC from total cell extracts failed in all possible combinations (data not shown), indicating that VVD and WCC do not interact in a stable manner. We constructed a strain expressing a strep-tagged version of VVD (cpc-1-vvdStrep). When VVDStrep was purified via a streptavidin affinity resin, WCC copurified in low but significant amounts (Figure S2A ). To detect interactions of low affinity by independent means, we examined the interaction of the LOV domains of WC-1 and VVD in the yeast two-hybrid system. The DNA binding domain (BD) of the Gal4 transcription factor was fused to the LOV domain of WC-1, and the transactivation domain of Gal4 (AD) was fused to the LOV domain of WC-1 and VVD, respectively. Pairs of LOV domain fusion proteins with BD (“bait”) and with the AD (“prey”) were expressed in a yeast reporter strain that allows selection for the interaction of “bait” and “prey” via the fused LOV domains. Since LOV domains are light receptors, the yeast transformants were grown in light as well as in darkness. The LOV domains of WC-1 displayed homodimerization as well as heterodimeric interaction with VVD when the corresponding yeast strains were grown on selective medium in light. However, the strains did not grow in darkness, indicating that the LOV domains did not interact in the absence of light (Figure 2A ). A positive control strain grew in light and in darkness while a negative control did not grow at all (Figure 2A). The data demonstrate that the LOV-domain of WC-1 has the capacity to interact with itself and with VVD in a light-dependent fashion. We then asked whether the interaction of VVD with WC-1 affects WCC function. WCC is a GATA-type transcription factor that binds to light-responsive elements, such as the proximal light regulatory element (LRE) of the frq promoter (pLRE). EMSA analysis can discriminate between light and dark states of the WCC (Froehlich et al., 2002Froehlich A.C. Liu Y. Loros J.J. Dunlap J.C. White Collar-1, a circadian blue light photoreceptor, binding to the frequency promoter.Science. 2002; 297: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, He and Liu, 2005He Q. Liu Y. Molecular mechanism of light responses in Neurospora: from light-induced transcription to photoadaptation.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2888-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Light-activated and dark forms of WCC display predominantly low or high electrophoretic mobility shifts (Figure 2B, lanes 1 and 2). Since we have shown above that the LOV domains of WC-1 dimerize in light-dependent fashion, the light-activated WCC should represent a dimer of the WCC monomer that is the prevalent form in the dark. To demonstrate this directly in an EMSA, we generated an antibody against the LOV domain of WC-1 that should interfere with dimerization of WCC protomers. Nuclear extracts of dark-grown mycelia were preincubated with an excess of LOV antibody over WCC to saturate each WC-1 molecule with one antibody. Subsequently, one aliquot was exposed to a saturating light pulse, while the other was kept in the dark. By EMSA analysis, the dark form of WCC was super-shifted to a single discrete band of lower mobility, indicating that one LOV antibody had bound to the WC-1 subunit of the WCC (Figure 2B, lane 3). However, a subsequent light pulse did not induce a further super-shift (lane 4). This finding indicates that binding of LOV antibodies to the dark form of WCC interfered with light-dependent dimerization. In a further assay, nuclear extract was first preincubated in light with the pLRE oligonucleotide to allow binding of the light-activated WCC dimer to its DNA binding site. Subsequently, LOV antibody was added and the sample was then analyzed by EMSA (lane 5). Under these conditions, the light-activated WCC was super-shifted, suggesting that the WCC dimer was crosslinked by one antibody bound to two LOV domains, a reaction that should be kinetically favored, when WCC is a dimer. Together, the data demonstrate that WCC dimerizes in a light-dependent fashion. If WCC dimers are highly dynamic, the monomer-dimer ratio should be sensitive to the WCC concentration. To vary the concentration of WCC, we performed EMSA in a fixed volume with increasing amounts of light-exposed nuclear extract. As expected, the intensity of the EMSA signals increased due to the increasing amounts of WCC (Figure S2B). At high concentrations of extract, only the mobility shift corresponding to the dimeric WCC was detected. However, a long exposure of the X-ray film revealed monomeric and dimeric WCC at low concentrations of light-exposed nuclear extract (Figure 2C and Figure S2B). This finding indicates that the light-induced dimerization of WCC is dynamic and depends on the concentration of WCC. For functional characterization of the interaction of VVD and WCC, nuclear extract was first exposed to a saturating light-pulse, then incubated with recombinant light-activated His6-VVD36 (Zoltowski et al., 2007Zoltowski B.D. Schwerdtfeger C. Widom J. Loros J.J. Bilwes A.M. Dunlap J.C. Crane B.R. Conformational switching in the fungal light sensor Vivid.Science. 2007; 316: 1054-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and finally, examined by EMSA (Figure 2D). In the presence of His6-VVD36, the light-activated WCC displayed a mobility shift characteristic for the dark form. In its absence, WCC displayed the dimer-specific mobility shift. These observations indicate that His6-VVD36 disrupted the WCC dimers. In further characterizations, the nuclear extract was exposed to light and preincubated with recombinant light-activated His6-VVD36 as described above. The sample was transferred to darkness, and anti-His antibody was added to oligomerize His6-VVD36 and thereby functionally neutralize the protein. Although the sample did not receive additional light, subsequent analysis by EMSA revealed that the dimer-specific mobility shift of the light-activated WCC was fully restored. The data demonstrate that VVD interacts with WCC and interferes with dimerization of the WCC protomers. It thereby functionally resets the light-activated WCC to the dark form. Activation of WCC protomers by light-induced dimerization and subsequent competitive inhibition of dimerization by newly synthesized VVD readily explains the phenomenon of induction and adaptation of WCC-dependent transcription in response to light on a molecular level. However, the model does not explain how the system maintains its light-sensing capacity over several orders of magnitude, since a sizable pool of the WCC must be in the dark state to sense a further increase in light intensity in constant light conditions. To estimate the equilibrium between WCC light and dark states, we measured the kinetics of formation and decay of the light complex. Nuclear extracts of dark-grown mycelia were exposed to light of different intensities, and the kinetics of WCC dimerization was analyzed by EMSA (Figures 3A and 3B ). At high light intensity (420 μmol × m−2 × s−1), an exposure of 15 s was sufficient for complete light activation of WCC. At intermediate intensity (80 μmol × m−2 × s−1), an exposure of about 5 min was required, and at low light (3.6 and 6 μmol × m−2 × s−1), 20–30 min was needed. When light-exposed nuclear extract was transferred to the dark, WCC dimers were stable for several hours (t1/2 ∼4 hr) (Figure 3C). The ratio of forward versus reverse rates indicates that the fraction of WCC in the dark state depends on light intensity. In bright light (420 μmol × m−2 × s−1), the fraction of WCC in the dark form is rather small (6 s/14,400 s = 4 × 10−4). In constant intermediate light (6 μmol × m−2 × s−1), about 12.5% of the WCC should be in the dark state (30 min/240 min). Extrapolating to low light, we estimate that the fraction of WCC in the dark form is substantial in dim light (>30% below 1 μmol × m−2 × s−1). Thus, the pool of WCC in the dark form is detectable and therefore of physiological relevance for light-sensing in the photoadapted state. Recombinant His6-VVD36 displayed similar light sensitivity and photoadduct stability (Figure S3). DNA-binding-competent, activated WCC is unstable (Schafmeier et al., 2008Schafmeier T.

Gene expression analysis suggests that Myc may also regulate the supply of acetyl-CoA, as metabolic pathways linked to acetyl-CoA synthesis are temporally regulated by Myc (9Morrish F. Neretti N.

Using [13C6]glucose metabolic tracer studies, we have recently shown that Myc regulates central carbon metabolism and the partitioning of glucose carbons in the TCA cycle during cell cycle entry (11Morrish F. Insern N. Sadilek M. Jeffrey M. Hockenbery D.M. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2485-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These results raise the possibility that Myc activation of mitochondrial metabolism increases the supply of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA as a substrate for lipid biosynthesis and nuclear histone acetylation. Here we have addressed this question by tracing the fate of [13C6]glucose carbons in myc+/+ and myc−/− cells during cell cycle entry. We formally demonstrate that glucose-derived carbons are utilized for lipid biosynthesis and histone acetylation, and that physiologic levels of Myc increase metabolic flux into these biosynthetic pathways. Cells were cultured and harvested as described (11Morrish F. Insern N. Sadilek M. Jeffrey M. Hockenbery D.M. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2485-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) with a modification in the duration of culture to 8 h to allow incorporation of 13C into lipids. For serum deprivation studies, cells were grown in 0.2% calf serum for 48 h prior to addition of [13C6]glucose. The concentration of [13C6]glucose was 20 mm as a sole labeled substrate and the dual-labeling concentration for both [13C6]glucose and [13C1]acetate was 10 mm. To allow dynamic labeling of histones with 13C-labeled acetyl groups we did not treat cells with sodium butyrate. Histone proteins were isolated from 1 × 108 cells and in vitro labeled as previously described (12Smith C.M. Gafken P.R. Zhang Z. Gottschling D.E. Smith J.B. Smith D.L. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 316: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We used a protocol previously developed for quantitation of histone acetylation using in vitro isotopic acetylation of unmodified lysines with deuterated acetic anhydride (12Smith C.M. Gafken P.R. Zhang Z. Gottschling D.E. Smith J.B. Smith D.L. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 316: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The mass difference between a deuterated acetyl group (45 Da) and a protiated acetyl group (42 Da) is 3 Da, allowing distinction between lysine residues acetylated in vitro and in vivo, respectively. This derivatization step, to fully acetylated H4, ensures that the rates of proteolytic digestion, HPLC elution and losses, electrospray ionization (ESI) efficiencies, and CID are independent of the in vivo acetylation patterns, ultimately allowing relative quantitation by ESI-MS/MS to be performed. Calculation of the relative enrichment of 1 × 13C acetyl groups from [13C1]acetate and 2 × 13C acetyl groups from [13C6]glucose on histone H4-K16 was determined as follows. Each MS/MS spectrum generated in these experiments contains superimposed copies of the isotopic distribution of the target peptide. These copies are shifted by zero, one, two, or three m/z units depending on the associated label. To determine the contribution of each label we calculated a theoretical isotopic distribution for the unmodified peptide using MS-isotope (13Clauser K.R. Baker P. Burlingame A.L. Anal.

Shifted copies of this isotopic distribution form a matrix of coefficients in the linear system Ax = b, where A is the coefficient matrix, b is a vector of observed intensities from the centroided MS/MS spectrum, and x is a vector of unknown weights specifying the contribution of each label. We solve for the unknown vector x using the “solve” command in the base package of the R environment for statistical computing (14R Development Core TeamA Language and Environment for Statistical Computing, R Foundation for Statistical Computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria2010Google Scholar). The first four elements in the resulting vector x are the contributions of the 12C, 13C, 13C2, and D3 peaks respectively. The sum of the remaining elements of x indicates the residual intensity unexplained by the model. Elements of x are divided by the D3 intensity to normalize and facilitate comparison across spectra. These normalized intensities are used to calculate the percentage of Lys-16 acetylation from any given source (in vitro, acetate and glucose), total acetylation, and unacetylation. For lipid analysis, cell pellets from 3 × 103 cells were resuspended in methanol/2.5% H2SO4, and incubated for 1 h at 80 °C to convert to fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), as described (15Watts J.L. Browse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5854-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The FAMEs were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) (Agilent 5975GC/MS). Isotopomers were monitored in a scanning ion mode customized to each fatty acid species of interest; for example, C16:0 MS scans ranged from m/z = 265 to m/z = 290. Labeling of palmitate was determined from relative intensities of ions at m/z 270–286. The incorporation of de novo labeled acetyl-CoA into palmitate was calculated using previously described methods that correct for natural abundance. Isotopomer spectral data graphs illustrate the fractional abundance of each isotopomer of palmitate ranging from mass M + 0, palmitate containing only 12C, to M + 16, palmitate containing all 16 carbons as 13C (16Holleran A.L. Fiskum G. Kelleher J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: E945-E951PubMed Google Scholar). The x-axes of these graphs are labeled as M0 to M16 to indicate the numbers of 13C atoms in palmitate. Fractional contribution of 13C-labeled carbon sources to fatty acid synthesis, D, and fractional new synthesis of fatty acids during time t, g(t), were estimated from the mass isotopomer distribution of palmitate based on the model of ISA as previously reported (17Kharroubi A.T. Masterson T.M. Aldaghlas T.A. Kennedy K.A. Kelleher J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E667-E675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at least three times, and statistical analysis of comparisons between myc−/− and myc+/+ samples was conducted using Student's t test. Previous studies with myc+/+ and myc−/− fibroblasts demonstrated that endogenous levels of Myc are required for increased respiration and mitochondrial oxidation of glucose-derived pyruvate during serum-induced cell cycle entry (9Morrish F. Neretti N. Sedivy J.M. Hockenbery D.M. Cell. Cycle. 2008; 7: 1054-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Acetyl groups generated from pyruvate oxidation in mitochondria can be utilized for de novo fatty acid synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum via citrate export and cleavage by ATP citrate lyase (18Srere P.A. Bhaduri A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 59: 487-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We used stable isotope labeling to determine if Myc also supported extra-mitochondrial flux of acetyl-CoA for lipid biosynthesis. Fibroblasts arrested by serum deprivation were stimulated to enter cell cycle by addition of serum for 16 h with addition of [13C6]glucose for the last 8 h. We determined the relative incorporation of 13C carbons into palmitate by GC/MS measurements of palmitate isotopomers (19Yoo H. Stephanopoulos G. Kelleher J.K. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 1324-1332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The fractional enrichment of palmitate isotopomers for myc−/− and myc+/+ cells are illustrated in Fig. 1A. This analysis indicates that myc+/+ cells have a 2-fold increase in palmitate isotopomers, (p < 0.005), with mass units M+6-M+14. We used isotopomer spectral analysis (ISA) to quantify lipogenic fluxes (17Kharroubi A.T. Masterson T.M. Aldaghlas T.A. Kennedy K.A. Kelleher J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E667-E675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fraction of palmitate resulting from de novo synthesis, g(t), was increased to 11% for myc+/+ cells compared with 6% for myc−/− cells. [13C]glucose metabolism provided 53% of the lipogenic acetyl-CoA pool (D) for myc+/+ cells, in contrast to 33% for myc−/− cells. De novo lipid synthesis, and to a lesser extent, fractional contribution of [13C]glucose to fatty acid synthesis, were up-regulated by serum addition from basal levels in serum-deprived cells (supplemental Fig. S1). Analysis of changes in total fatty acid species on addition of serum demonstrate a significant increase in saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) for myc+/+ compared with myc−/− cells (Fig. 1B). This shift in fatty acid composition may reflect an increase in de novo fatty acid synthesis as well as increased metabolism of PUFAs. These results demonstrate that Myc-dependent glucose oxidation during cell cycle entry provides substrates for de novo lipid biosynthesis required for cell division. Myc expression correlates with global histone H3 and H4 acetylation, which requires the Myc target GCN5 histone acetyltransferase (8Knoepfler P.S. Zhang X.Y. Cheng P.F. Gafken P.R. McMahon S.B. Eisenman R.N. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2723-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Histone acetyltransferases utilize nuclear acetyl-CoA as a substrate. To determine the source of acetyl-CoA, we incubated in [13C6]glucose and looked for incorporation of 13C-acetyl groups at four universally conserved lysine residues (Lys-5, Lys-8, Lys-12, and Lys-16) located within the N-terminal tail of histone H4, by collision-induced dissociation (CID)-MS/MS. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, the histone H4 N-terminal tail contains 4 lysines, each of which may be acetylated in vivo to varying degrees. After in vitro acetylation and tryptic digestion the peptides generated will consist of combination of the following; protiated acetyl 12C (H12), protiated acetyl 13C (H13), and deuterated acetyl (D) (Fig. 2C). To determine the relative abundance of acetylated histone H4, trypsin-digested peptides were analyzed by LC-ESI MS/MS. The expanded spectral overlay for the doubly charged precursor ion encompassing tryptic peptide residues 4–17 includes all of the isotopic forms of H4(4–17), from fully protiated (HHHH, 4 Ac) to fully deuterated (DDDD, 0 Ac) (Fig. 2A). For each lysine acetylated in vitro, there is an isotopic shift of 3/2 = 1.5 m/z. Superimposed on this pattern is the 2/2 = 1 m/z shift associated with 13C-acetyl groups. Because of signals from naturally occurring 12C-acetyl groups superimposing on signals from [13C]glucose-derived acetyl groups, an isotope correction tool was utilized (described under “Experimental Procedures”) to calculate the signals from 12C, 13C2, and 2D3 acetyl peaks, which are expressed as relative ratios, with 1 as the total combined unacetylated and acetylated histone. Peak height differences are observed for 13C-labeled singly, doubly, and triply acetylated peptide ions, consistent with increased utilization of [13C]glucose for histone H4 acetylation in myc+/+ cells (Fig. 2A). To evaluate the fractional enrichment of 13C2-acetyl groups at specific lysines in H4(4–17), we analyzed CID-produced fragment ions by MS/MS. By determining the intensity of signals from endogenous acetylation (m/z 530), [13C6]glucose-derived acetylation (m/z 532) and deuterium-labeled acetylation (m/z 533), both the fractional contribution of 13C6-derived glucose carbons to acetylation of H4-K16 and the total (combined 12C and 13C) levels of acetylation are calculated (Fig. 2C). As illustrated in Fig. 2B, the expression of Myc increased the level of 13C2-acetyl present on histone H4-K16, contributing to the higher total acetylation present in myc+/+ cells compared with myc−/− cells (Fig. 3A). Comparing levels of total acetylation with 13C2-acetyl groups, it is evident that acetyl groups derived from [13C]glucose contributed ∼50% of acetylated H4-K16 in myc+/+ cells (Fig. 3A). The calculation of both total acetylation and levels of 13C-acetylation provide insights into two Myc-regulated events that control levels of histone acetylation. The first (Fig. 4A) is HAT activity, demonstrated by a log2 ratio for total H4-K16-acetylation of 0.35 (p < 0.01) in myc+/+ cells compared with myc−/− cells. The second (Fig. 4B) is the pool of nucleocytoplasmic 13C-acetyl groups from the mitochondria, shown by a log2 ratio for 13C-acetylation at H4-K16 of 0.5 (p = 0.035) for myc+/+ compared with myc−/− cells. Taken together, the data suggest Myc effects on substrate supply contribute substantially to overall HAT activity when fed glucose. To further investigate the importance of mitochondrial acetyl-CoA supply to histone acetylation, and the impact of alternative carbon sources, we incubated cells in [13C6]glucose in combination with [13C1]acetate. This dual-label stable isotope protocol allows tracking of the source of the acetyl groups on histones, as 13C1-Ac derived from acetate or 13C2-Ac derived from glucose (Fig. 3D). As illustrated in Fig. 3, A and B, the addition of acetate increased the total acetylation of histones. Both myc−/− and myc+/+ cells utilized acetate in addition to glucose as substrates for H4 acetylation (Fig. 3B), but myc−/− cells have a significantly greater contribution from acetate compared with myc+/+ cells (Fig. 3C). The myc+/+ cells, in contrast, have equivalent contributions from both acetate and glucose, and continue to utilize glucose at higher rates than myc−/− cells (Fig. 3C). When the contributions of substrate supply to HAT activity are compared, myc+/+ cells incubated with labeled acetate and glucose maintain an increased dependence on glucose substrate for histone acetylation (Fig. 4D). The increased utilization of acetate by myc−/− cells is highlighted by the significant negative log2 ratio for acetate-derived 13C-acetyl groups when compared with myc+/+ cells (Fig. 4D). As a result the difference between myc+/+ and myc−/− cells in total acetyl-H4-K16 is reduced (Fig. 4C). Acetylation of H4-K16 serves as a switch for altering chromatin from a repressed to a transcriptionally active state in yeast and humans (20Shia W.J. Pattenden S.G. Workman J.L. Genome Biol. 2006; 7: 217Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), subject to dynamic modification during cell cycle entry (1Pesavento J.J. Bullock C.R. LeDuc R.D. Mizzen C.A. Kelleher N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14927-14937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), and an epigenetic signature of cell proliferation (21Gupta A. Guerin-Peyrou T.G. Sharma G.G. Park C. Agarwal M. Ganju R.K. Pandita S. Choi K. Sukumar S. Pandita R.K. Ludwig T. Pandita T.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 397-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The increased 13C-acetylation of H4(4–17) observed with Myc expression indicates an important role for Myc in substrate supply in addition to increased GCN5 expression affecting histone acetylation rates. These data confirm that mitochondria provide a source of acetyl-CoA for histone acetylation and demonstrate how Myc activation of mitochondrial function can amplify its ability to induce global chromatin remodeling by providing substrates required for histone acetylation. This study demonstrates that the oncogene c-Myc increases the supply of acetyl groups from glucose required for histone H4-K16-acetylation, during serum-induced cell cycle entry (1Pesavento J.J. Bullock C.R. LeDuc R.D. Mizzen C.A. Kelleher N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14927-14937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our analysis using [13C6]glucose as a tracer demonstrates that these acetyl groups are derived from mitochondrial oxidation of glucose, consistent with the recent report that ATP citrate lyase is required for nutrient-dependent regulation of histone acetylation (7Wellen K.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Sachdeva U.M. Bui T.V. Cross J.R. Thompson C.B. Science. 2009; 324: 1076-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar). By conducting these studies with 13C-labeled glucose, we were able to trace the de novo production and addition of acetyl groups to histones during cell cycle entry (Fig. 3D). We additionally addressed the relative prioritization of substrates for histone acetylation by provision of both [13C1]acetate and [13C6]glucose. We show that endogenous levels of Myc increase the export and utilization of mitochondrially derived acetyl groups for synthesis of the fatty acid palmitate during cell cycle entry. During a labeling period restricted to 8 h during G1 progression, 11% of total palmitate was synthesized de novo from a cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA pool, 53% of which is derived from the [13C]glucose tracer. The remainder of the cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA pool is likely derived from fatty acids or endogenous glycogen stores. Higher glucose concentrations in the media increase cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA pools and lipid synthesis by increasing glycolytic flux (7Wellen K.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Sachdeva U.M. Bui T.V. Cross J.R. Thompson C.B. Science. 2009; 324: 1076-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar, 29Kharroubi A.T. Masterson T.M. Aldaghlas T.A. Kennedy K.A. Kelleher J.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: E667-E675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the current study, comparing myc+/+ and myc−/− cells entering the cell cycle, the mechanisms responsible for Myc-induced increases in the contribution of glucose to cytosolic acetyl-CoA likely include Myc activation of mitochondrial biogenesis (9Morrish F. Neretti N. Sedivy J.M. Hockenbery D.M. Cell. Cycle. 2008; 7: 1054-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), increased glycoltic flux and entry of glucose carbons into the TCA cycle during cell cycle entry (11Morrish F. Insern N. Sadilek M. Jeffrey M. Hockenbery D.M. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2485-2491Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A comparison of fatty acid profiles for these two cell lines shows increased levels of saturated fatty acids in myc+/+ cells. The reduced levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids in myc+/+ cells may reflect turnover or increased generation of bioactive lipids. These data are in contrast to results from inducible MycER expression in MEFs, in which Myc promotes preferential utilization of glutamine for phospholipid synthesis (22Wise D.R. Deberardinis R.J. Mancuso A. Sayed N. Zhang X.Y. Pfeiffer H.K. Nissim I. Daikhin E. Yudkoff M. McMahon S.B. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18782-18787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). However, cells with oncogenic levels of Myc are glutamine-dependent, unlike cells with physiologic expression of Myc. The metabolic effects of oncogenic Myc were analyzed in actively dividing cells, with no differences in cell proliferation reported with Myc induction (22Wise D.R. Deberardinis R.J. Mancuso A. Sayed N. Zhang X.Y. Pfeiffer H.K. Nissim I. Daikhin E. Yudkoff M. McMahon S.B. Thompson C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18782-18787Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). Our recent data indicates that physiologic expression of Myc also increases the synthesis of lipids during cell cycle entry when cells are provided with glutamine, acetate, or acetoacetate as a sole carbon source. 3F. Morrish, unpublished data. A role for Myc in activation of de novo lipid synthesis required for cell division is further substantiated by the temporal activation of multiple genes involved in lipid synthesis including acetoacetyl-CoA synthetase (Aacs) and ATP citrate lyase (Acly) (9Morrish F. Neretti N. Sedivy J.M. Hockenbery D.M. Cell. Cycle. 2008; 7: 1054-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Of note, labeling with 13C6 was carried out in the presence of fetal calf serum dialyzed to remove competing fuels with the exception of protein-bound lipids. Thus, endogenous levels of Myc promote de novo fatty acid synthesis even when exogenous fatty acids are available. Changes in histone acetylation occur during cell cycle entry (1Pesavento J.J. Bullock C.R. LeDuc R.D. Mizzen C.A. Kelleher N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 14927-14937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Using metabolic tracer techniques, we determined that up to ∼50% of acetyl groups detected on the N-terminal tail of histone H4 are derived from oxidation of glucose. As cells were only labeled for the second of two 8-h periods after serum addition, this value is likely an underestimate of de novo labeling during the G0-S transition. Two carbon fragments are only generated from hexose substrates by mitochondrial metabolism. This significant contribution documents the importance of mitochondria in the provision of substrates for post-translational modification of proteins in mammalian cells which, unlike S. cerevisiae, contain ATP citrate lyase and, as a result, access to a mitochondrial supply of acetyl groups (6Takahashi H. McCaffery J.M. Irizarry R.A. Boeke J.D. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 207-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 23Pronk J.T. Yde Steensma H. Van Dijken J.P. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1607-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). These experiments were conducted with 13C-labeled glucose, however, exogenous acetate can also supply acetyl-CoA for histone acetyltransferases in mammalian cells (7Wellen K.E. Hatzivassiliou G. Sachdeva U.M. Bui T.V. Cross J.R. Thompson C.B. Science. 2009; 324: 1076-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1476) Google Scholar). Our analysis of the contribution of exogenous [13C1]acetate to acetylation of histones demonstrates that acetyl-CoA synthetase is active in both cell lines. Glucose-derived acetylation is diminished by the additional substrate, but less prominently in myc+/+ cells, perhaps as a consequence of Myc-dependent glucose metabolism. Total acetylation increases in both cell lines, reflecting the increased availability of nuclear acetyl-CoA. In addition, at least one HAT, P/CAF, can be activated and translocated to the nucleus by autoacetylation (24Blanco-Garciá N. Asensio-Juan E. de la Crux X. Martinez-Balbás M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 1343-1352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Acetyl groups generated by peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation (25Reszko A.E. Kasumov T. David F. Jobbins K.A. Thomas K.R. Hoppel C.L. Brunengraber H. Des Rosiers C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19574-19579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or ketone body metabolism (26Bartley J.C. Lipids. 1976; 11: 774-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar) also provide a source of cytoplasmic acetyl groups for histone acetylation. The methods we have developed here provide a way to evaluate the contribution of different substrates to histone acetylation, and other recently identified acetylated proteins (27Choudhary D. Kuman D. Gnad F. Nielsen M.L. Rehman M. Walther T.C. Olsen J.V. Mann M. Science. 2009; 325: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (3168) Google Scholar), in different physiological contexts. We have previously shown that myc−/− cells have reduced mitochondrial function and treatment of myc+/+ cells with rotenone recapitulates the slow growth phenotype of myc−/− cells (9Morrish F. Neretti N. Sedivy J.M. Hockenbery D.M. Cell. Cycle. 2008; 7: 1054-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 4, up-regulation of histone acetyltransferase activities, such as GCN5, would not explain the differences in 13C-acetyl histone labeling between myc+/+ and myc−/− cells. This increased labeling requires an increase in the [13C]acetyl-CoA pool, which in these experiment is derived from mitochondrial glucose oxidation. Together, these data suggest that Myc ability to increase mitochondrial function and the flux of glucose carbons through PDH play a significant role in the ability of Myc to increase histone acetylation required for global chromatin remodeling. Overall these results add to the accumulating evidence for Myc involvement as a nutritional sensor (28Teleman A.A. Hietakangas V. Sayadian A.C. Cohen S.M. Cell. Metab. 2008; 7: 21-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and regulator of the coordination between proteomic and metabolomic networks required for post-translational modification of proteins (11Morrish F.

https://openalex.org/W2050862868,"Background We previously reported increased levels of protein-linked fucosylation with the development of liver cancer and identified many of the proteins containing the altered glycan structures. One such protein is alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT). To advance these studies, we performed N-linked glycan analysis on the five major isoforms of A1AT and completed a comprehensive study of the glycosylation of A1AT found in healthy controls, patients with hepatitis C- (HCV) induced liver cirrhosis, and in patients infected with HCV with a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methodology/Principal Findings Patients with liver cirrhosis and liver cancer had increased levels of triantennary glycan-containing outer arm (α-1,3) fucosylation. Increases in core (α-1,6) fucosylation were observed only on A1AT from patients with cancer. We performed a lectin fluorophore-linked immunosorbent assay using Aleuria Aurantia lectin (AAL), specific for core and outer arm fucosylation in over 400 patients with liver disease. AAL-reactive A1AT was able to detect HCC with a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 86%, which was greater than that observed with the current marker of HCC, alpha-fetoprotein. Glycosylation analysis of the false positives was performed; results indicated that these patients had increases in outer arm fucosylation but not in core fucosylation, suggesting that core fucosylation is cancer specific. Conclusions/Significance This report details the stepwise change in the glycosylation of A1AT with the progression from liver cirrhosis to cancer and identifies core fucosylation on A1AT as an HCC specific modification."

Unlike classical αβ T cells, less is known about the molecular requirements of γδ T cell activation. Two studies demonstrate that the junctional adhesion molecule–like protein (JAML) is a costimulatory molecule for mouse γδ T. Witherden et al. (p. 1205 ; see the Perspective by Shaw and Huang ) showed that JAML, binding to its ligand Coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR), leads to proliferation, as well as cytokine and growth factor production by γδ T cells. In vivo, JAML-CAR interactions contributed to the wound healing response in mice. Verdino et al.

https://openalex.org/W2048674504,"Classical NF-kappaB signaling functions as a negative regulator of skeletal myogenesis through potentially multiple mechanisms. The inhibitory actions of TNFalpha on skeletal muscle differentiation are mediated in part through sustained NF-kappaB activity. In dystrophic muscles, NF-kappaB activity is compartmentalized to myofibers to inhibit regeneration by limiting the number of myogenic progenitor cells. This regulation coincides with elevated levels of muscle derived TNFalpha that is also under IKKbeta and NF-kappaB control.Based on these findings we speculated that in DMD, TNFalpha secreted from myotubes inhibits regeneration by directly acting on satellite cells. Analysis of several satellite cell regulators revealed that TNFalpha is capable of inhibiting Notch-1 in satellite cells and C2C12 myoblasts, which was also found to be dependent on NF-kappaB. Notch-1 inhibition occurred at the mRNA level suggesting a transcriptional repression mechanism. Unlike its classical mode of action, TNFalpha stimulated the recruitment of Ezh2 and Dnmt-3b to coordinate histone and DNA methylation, respectively. Dnmt-3b recruitment was dependent on Ezh2.We propose that in dystrophic muscles, elevated levels of TNFalpha and NF-kappaB inhibit the regenerative potential of satellite cells via epigenetic silencing of the Notch-1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W2020120027,"The intracellular human pathogen Legionella pneumophila translocates multiple proteins in the host cytosol known as effectors, which subvert host cellular processes to create a membrane-bound organelle that supports bacterial replication. It was observed that several Legionella effectors encode a prototypical eukaryotic prenylation CAAX motif (where C represents a cysteine residue and A denotes an aliphatic amino acid). These bacterial motifs mediated posttranslational modification of effector proteins resulting in the addition of either a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl isoprenyl lipid moiety to the cysteine residue of the CAAX tetrapeptide. Lipidation enhanced membrane affinity for most Legionella CAAX motif proteins and facilitated the localization of these effector proteins to host organelles. Host farnesyltransferase and class I geranylgeranyltransferase were both involved in the lipidation of the Legionella CAAX motif proteins. Perturbation of the host prenylation machinery during infection adversely affected the remodeling of the Legionella-containing vacuole. Thus, these data indicate that Legionella utilize the host prenylation machinery to facilitate targeting of effector proteins to membrane-bound organelles during intracellular infection."
https://openalex.org/W2099498225,"Bacterial mRNAs often contain leader sequences that respond to specific metabolites or ions by altering expression of the associated downstream protein-coding sequences. Here we report that the leader RNA of the Mg2+ transporter gene mgtA of Salmonella enterica, which was previously known to function as a Mg2+-sensing riboswitch, harbors an 18 codon proline-rich open reading frame—termed mgtL—that permits intracellular proline to regulate mgtA expression. Interfering with mgtL translation by genetic, pharmacological, or environmental means was observed to increase the mRNA levels from the mgtA coding region. Substitution of the mgtL proline codons by other codons abolished the response to proline and to hyperosmotic stress but not to Mg2+. Our findings show that mRNA leader sequences can consist of complex regulatory elements that utilize different mechanisms to sense separate signals and mediate an appropriate cellular response."

Macrophages, which are localized in the rupture-prone shoulder regions of coronary plaques, are thought to play a major role in plaque destabilization and rupture through the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). When human monocyte-derived macrophages were stimulated in vitro with C5a, MMP-1 and MMP-9 mRNA levels were significantly increased. Furthermore, C5a up-regulated MMP-1 and MMP-9 antigens and activity, as determined by ELISA and specific activity assays. These effects were blocked by antibodies against the receptor C5aR/CD88. In addition, blocking experiments revealed that MMP-1 expression was mediated by activation of the transcription factor AP-1, and MMP-9 expression was induced by activation of NF-κB and AP-1. Immunohistochemical analysis of human coronary plaques demonstrated the colocalization of C5a, MMP-1, and MMP-9 in vivo.

Limited resources for conservation require that we efficiently prioritize where and how to best sustain coral reef ecosystems.Here we develop the first prioritization approach that can guide regional-scale conservation investments in land- and sea-based conservation actions that cost-effectively mitigate threats to coral reefs, and apply it to the Coral Triangle, an area of significant global attention and funding. Using information on threats to marine ecosystems, effectiveness of management actions at abating threats, and the management and opportunity costs of actions, we calculate the rate of return on investment in two conservation actions in sixteen ecoregions. We discover that marine conservation almost always trumps terrestrial conservation within any ecoregion, but terrestrial conservation in one ecoregion can be a better investment than marine conservation in another. We show how these results could be used to allocate a limited budget for conservation and compare them to priorities based on individual criteria.Previous prioritization approaches do not consider both land and sea-based threats or the socioeconomic costs of conserving coral reefs. A simple and transparent approach like ours is essential to support effective coral reef conservation decisions in a large and diverse region like the Coral Triangle, but can be applied at any scale and to other marine ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W1983213024,"Porcine enzootic pneumonia is a chronic respiratory disease that affects swine. The etiological agent of the disease, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, is a bacterium that adheres to cilia of the swine respiratory tract, resulting in loss of cilia and epithelial cell damage. A M. hyopneumoniae protein P116, encoded by mhp108, was investigated as a potential adhesin. Examination of P116 expression using proteomic analyses observed P116 as a full-length protein and also as fragments, ranging from 17 to 70 kDa in size. A variety of pathogenic bacterial species have been shown to bind the extracellular matrix component fibronectin as an adherence mechanism. M. hyopneumoniae cells were found to bind fibronectin in a dose-dependent and saturable manner. Surface plasmon resonance was used to show that a recombinant C-terminal domain of P116 bound fibronectin at physiologically relevant concentrations (K(D) 24 ± 6 nm). Plasmin(ogen)-binding proteins are also expressed by many bacterial pathogens, facilitating extracellular matrix degradation. M. hyopneumoniae cells were found to also bind plasminogen in a dose-dependent and saturable manner; the C-terminal domain of P116 binds to plasminogen (K(D) 44 ± 5 nm). Plasminogen binding was abolished when the C-terminal lysine of P116 was deleted, implicating this residue as part of the plasminogen binding site. P116 fragments adhere to the PK15 porcine kidney epithelial-like cell line and swine respiratory cilia. Collectively these data suggest that P116 is an important adhesin and virulence factor of M. hyopneumoniae."
https://openalex.org/W2024090897,"In response to extracellular cues, signal transduction activates downstream transcription factors like c-Jun to induce expression of target genes. We demonstrate that the ATAC (Ada two A containing) histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex serves as a transcriptional cofactor for c-Jun at the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) target genes Jra and chickadee. ATAC subunits are required for c-Jun occupancy of these genes and for H4K16 acetylation at the Jra enhancer, promoter, and transcribed sequences. Under conditions of osmotic stress, ATAC colocalizes with c-Jun, recruits the upstream kinases Misshapen, MKK4, and JNK, and suppresses further activation of JNK. Relocalization of these MAPKs and suppression of JNK activation by ATAC are dependent on the CG10238 subunit of ATAC. Thus, ATAC governs the transcriptional response to MAP kinase signaling by serving as both a coactivator of transcription and as a suppressor of upstream signaling."

Measurements of IP3-induced Ca2+ fluxes of mutagenized mouse type 1 IP3R (IP3R1) showed that the residues responsible for IP3 binding suppression in this domain were not essential for channel opening. On the other hand, a single amino acid substitution of Tyr-167 to alanine completely impaired IP3-induced Ca2+ release without reducing the IP3 binding activity.

The structure of IP3R can be divided into three functional domains: an N-terminal IP3-binding domain, a channel-forming domain localized to the C terminus, and a regulatory/coupling domain connecting these two domains (23Mignery G.A.

The C-terminal channel-forming domain of IP3R is further divided into two subdomains: a transmembrane domain and a gatekeeper domain (Fig. 1). The transmembrane domain contains six membrane-spanning regions (M1–M6) (25Galvan D.L. Borrego-Diaz E. Perez P.J. Mignery G.A. J. Biol.

The cytosolic C-terminal tail region (residues 2590–2749) contains a cysteine residue, Cys-2613, that is critical for the activation gating, and this region has been proposed to work as a gatekeeper that triggers the opening of the activation gate of the channel following IP3 binding (30Uchida K. Miyauchi H. Furuichi T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16551-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The IP3-binding domain is divided into two subdomains: an N-terminal suppressor domain and a C-terminal IP3-binding core (Fig. 1). The IP3-binding core is the minimum region required for specific IP3 binding (31Yoshikawa F. Morita M. Monkawa T. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Cell. 2005; 17: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and functions to attenuate the IP3 binding affinity of the IP3-binding core to generate isoform-specific IP3 binding affinities (31Yoshikawa F.

Ikura M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12755-12764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Seven conserved residues clustered on one side of the head subdomain are critical for the IP3 binding suppression (35Bosanac I. Yamazaki H. Matsu-ura T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), and 11 non-conserved residues in the head subdomain are responsible for the generation of isoform-specific affinities (34Iwai M. Michikawa T. Bosanac I. Ikura M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12755-12764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 223-amino acid region is required not only for suppression of IP3 binding but also for channel gating because a mutant IP3R1 lacking residues 1–223 did not exhibit any measurable IP3-induced Ca2+ release activity, although it had 10-fold higher IP3 binding affinity and seemed to retain the normal folded structure of the C-terminal channel-forming domain (30Uchida K. Miyauchi H. Furuichi T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16551-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Therefore, this N-terminal region is referred to as a suppressor/coupling domain and has been proposed to play a key role in connecting IP3 binding with channel opening (30Uchida K. Miyauchi H. Furuichi T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16551-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Limited trypsinization induces fragmentation of mouse IP3R1 into five major fragments (Fig. 1), and the four N-terminal cytosolic fragments (I, II, III, and IV) are associated with the remaining C-terminal fragment V that encompasses the channel-forming domain (36Joseph S.K. Pierson S. Samanta S. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 859-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 37Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Trypsinized IP3R retains significant IP3-induced Ca2+ release activity (37Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), indicating that structural coupling among the five split components allows functional coupling between IP3 binding and channel opening. Expression of the channel-forming domain of mouse IP3R1 (residues 2216–2749) alone increases Ca2+ leakage from the endoplasmic reticulum in intact cells (38Nakayama T. Hattori M. Uchida K. Nakamura T. Tateishi Y. Bannai H. Iwai M. Michikawa T. Inoue T. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), suggesting that the channel-forming domain forms a constitutively active channel and that the N-terminal cytosolic region (residues 1–2215) is necessary to keep the channel domain closed. Cross-linking experiments of trypsin-digested IP3R showed that the N-terminal tryptic fragment I (∼340 residues) containing the suppressor/coupling domain and part of the IP3-binding core is located near the C-terminal tryptic fragment V (39Boehning D. Joseph S.K. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5450-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because deletion of the M4-M5 linker, comprising the cytosolic region between transmembrane regions M4 and M5 (Fig. 1), facilitates the dissociation of fragment I from trypsin-treated microsomal vesicles and disrupts the IP3-induced Ca2+ flux in COS-7 cells, Schug and Joseph (40Schug Z.T. Joseph S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 24431-24440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) have proposed that one C-terminal site for the interaction between the N-terminal IP3-binding site and the C-terminal channel-forming domain is within the M4-M5 linker and that IP3-induced conformational changes in the N-terminal IP3-binding domain are mechanically transmitted to pore opening through an attachment to the M4-M5 linker. However, the residues that directly interact with the M4-M5 linker have not been identified. In this study, we searched for critical residues for channel gating within the N-terminal suppressor/coupling domain and found that a single amino acid substitution at Tyr-167 completely disrupted the IP3-induced Ca2+ release activity of IP3R1. The corresponding residue in IP3R3, Trp-168, was also required for channel opening. Biochemical analyses in this study and an accompanying paper (57Chan J. Yamazaki H. Ishiyama N. Seo M.D. Mal T.K. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36092-36099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) produced strong evidence that these residues directly interacted with the M4-M5 linker within the C-terminal channel-forming domain. Quantitative measurements of the digestion rate of the C-terminal gatekeeper domain after trypsin digestion suggested that the Tyr/Trp residue (Tyr-167 in IP3R1 and Trp-168 in IP3R3) within the suppressor/coupling domain acts to maintain the structural integrity of the gatekeeper domain. The details of these procedures are given in the supplemental material. Stable cell lines expressing recombinant IP3Rs were established from intrinsically IP3R-deficient R23-11 cells (41Sugawara H.

Protein concentrations were determined with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using BSA as a standard. The IP3 binding affinity of IP3R was measured as described previously (17Iwai M. Tateishi Y.

Microsomal fractions (30 μg) in cytosol-like medium (pH 7.4 at 4 °C) containing 0.5 mm EGTA were incubated with 0.15–11 nm [3H]IP3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and various concentrations (10–400 nm) of unlabeled IP3 (Dojindo). Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 10 μm unlabeled IP3. Nonlinear regression of the IP3 binding data was performed with the Hill-Langmuir equation,B=Bmax[IP3]Kd+[IP3](Eq. 1) where B is the concentration of IP3 bound to the receptor, Bmax is the concentration of the total binding sites, [IP3] is the free IP3 concentration, and Kd is the dissociation constant. The IP3-induced Ca2+ efflux from microsomal vesicles was monitored using a method described previously (37Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, microsomal fractions (300 μg of protein) were suspended in 500 μl of cytosol-like medium that was passed through Chelex-100 and supplemented with 1 μg/ml oligomycin (Sigma), 2 mm MgCl2, 25 μg/ml creatine kinase (Roche Applied Science), 10 mm phosphocreatine (Sigma), and 2 μm fura-2 (Dojindo). The suspension was stirred continuously at 30 °C during measurements. Ca2+ was accumulated within microsomal vesicles by the addition of 1 mm ATP after the addition of an aliquot (≤3 μl) of 0.5 mm CaCl2. IP3 was applied when the concentration of extravesicular free Ca2+ was within the range of 400–500 nm. The total amount of releasable Ca2+ within the vesicles was measured by the addition of 2 μm Ca2+ ionophore 4-BrA23187 (Sigma). Fluorescent signals of fura-2 were monitored at 20 Hz with a CAF-110 spectrofluorometer (Jasco) and a PowerLab data acquisition system (ADInstruments). An emission wavelength of 510 nm with alternate excitation at 340 and 380 nm (F340 and F380, respectively) was used. For calibration of the fura-2 signals, 1 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm EGTA were sequentially added at the end of each measurement. The Ca2+ concentrations were calculated as described previously (44Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Limited trypsin digestion was performed as described previously (37Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Briefly, microsomal vesicles (2 mg of protein/ml) were incubated with 2 μg/ml N-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) at 35 °C in a buffer comprising 110 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.33 at 35 °C). The free Ca2+ concentrations in the buffer were adjusted using HEDTA and confirmed with a Ca2+-sensitive electrode (Metrohm) as described previously (42Michikawa T. Hirota J. Kawano S. Hiraoka M. Yamada M. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. Neuron. 1999; 23: 799-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The apparent dissociation constant of HEDTA for Ca2+ in the buffer was estimated to be 2.64 μm. The trypsin digestion was terminated by the addition of 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). After the trypsin treatment, the microsomal lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were concentrated by 4-fold by 10% trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Trypsin-treated microsomal lysates (14.6 μg of protein/lane) and supernatants obtained from 58.5 μg of microsomal protein/lane were applied to 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Tryptic fragments of recombinant IP3R1 were detected by Western blotting using N1, 4C11, 10A6, anti-(1718-31), 18A10, and 1ML1 antibodies (Fig. 1) (37Yoshikawa F. Iwasaki H. Michikawa T. Furuichi T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 316-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and quantified using the ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). To calculate the ratios of the intensities of the 18A10 signals and the 1ML1 signals, we applied all of the samples obtained from single experiments onto single SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and both the 18A10 and 1ML1 signals were collected from the same membrane by stripping and reprobing. In a previous study (35Bosanac I. Yamazaki H. Matsu-ura T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), we identified a set of amino acid residues (Leu-30, Leu-32, Val-33, Asp-34, Arg-36, Arg-54, and Lys-127) that comprise a critical site for IP3 binding suppression in the context of an N-terminal 604-amino acid construct of mouse IP3R1 (T604m1). To investigate whether these residues are required for channel gating, we constructed nine different full-length IP3R1 constructs that encoded eight single point mutants (L30K, L32K, V33K, D34K, R36E, K52E, R54E, and K127E) and one deletion mutant, D(67–108), lacking the arm subdomain (Fig. 1). We introduced these IP3R1 mutant constructs into intrinsically IP3R-deficient R23-11 cells derived from chicken B-cell line DT40 cells (41Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) and attempted to establish cell lines stably expressing each of the recombinant proteins using a method described previously (30Uchida K. Miyauchi H. Furuichi T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16551-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We successfully obtained cell lines for eight of the mutants but could not establish stable cell lines expressing R36E under the conditions used. Because the expression levels of the recombinant proteins varied from cell line to cell line (see below), multiple cell lines were used for the following assays. In equilibrium [3H]IP3 binding analyses, five mutants (L30K, L32K, V33K, D34K, and K127E) exhibited significantly high IP3 binding affinities (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table SIII) that were comparable with that of D(1–223) lacking the entire suppressor/coupling domain (Fig. 1) (30Uchida K. Miyauchi H. Furuichi T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16551-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), thereby confirming that these residues are critical for IP3 binding suppression within the tetrameric channel complex. On the other hand, R54E, which is less effective in liberating the effect of the suppressor domain on IP3 binding to T604m1 (35Bosanac I. Yamazaki H. Matsu-ura T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), exhibited no change in the binding affinity compared with that of wild-type IP3R1 (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table SIII). Similarly, the K52E mutant, which induces a significant decrease in the IP3 binding affinity of T604m1 (35Bosanac I. Yamazaki H. Matsu-ura T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), showed no effect on IP3 binding in the context of full-length IP3R1 (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table SIII). Finally, the D(67–108) construct lacking the arm subdomain showed a significant increase in the IP3 binding affinity compared with the full-length IP3R1 construct (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table SIII), similar to that observed for T604m1 (35Bosanac I. Yamazaki H. Matsu-ura T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results for the full-length IP3R1 constructs are highly consistent with the findings of a previous mutagenesis study using T604m1 constructs (35Bosanac I. Yamazaki H. Matsu-ura T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To examine the IP3-induced Ca2+ release activities of the mutants, we monitored 1 μm IP3-induced Ca2+ fluxes from microsomal vesicles prepared from the stable cell lines (supplemental Fig. S1A). Because the fraction of Ca2+ released by IP3 relative to the total amount of releasable Ca2+ in the vesicles was relatively constant regardless of the amount of releasable Ca2+ (supplemental Fig. S1B), we used the fractional values as percentages to estimate the IP3-induced Ca2+ release activities of the mutant channels. Fig. 3A shows the relationship between the fractions of IP3-induced Ca2+ release and the expression levels of the wild-type and mutant IP3R1 channels. Because the expression levels of most of the mutants were lower than that of wild-type IP3R1 (Fig. 3A), even when the same chicken β-actin promoter was used to establish the cell lines, we also used the CMV promoter to obtain cell lines expressing lower amounts of wild-type IP3R1. The amount of Ca2+ release by the wild-type channel was proportional to its expression level with a slope of 20.3%/(pmol/mg protein) (R2 = 0.631) (Fig. 3A). Similar responses were observed for all of the mutants except for the non-functional D(1–223) mutant. To compare the Ca2+ release activities between the wild-type and mutant channels directly, we calculated the percentage of Ca2+ release per unit amount of each channel expressed. The L32K, V33K, and K52E mutants exhibited Ca2+ release activities that were lower than that of wild-type IP3R1 but significantly higher than that of the D(1–223) mutant (Fig. 3B). The L30K, D34K, R54E, K127E, and D(67–108) mutants exhibited Ca2+ release activities that were indistinguishable from that of wild-type IP3R1 (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the residues responsible for modulating the IP3 binding affinity and the arm subdomain in the suppressor/coupling domain are not directly involved in the functional communication with the channel-forming domain of the receptor. We hypothesized that the critical residues for channel gating should be highly conserved amino acid residues that are localized on the molecular surface of the suppressor/coupling domain (Fig. 4A, top). According to this hypothesis, we selected 26 amino acid residues for evaluation (Fig. 4A, bottom). Five amino acid residues (Asp-35, Pro-49, Pro-50, Lys-51, and Phe-53) within the most conserved surface region (C1) (35Bosanac I. Yamazaki H. Matsu-ura T. Michikawa T. Mikoshiba K. Ikura M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) were singly or doubly substituted in mutant constructs (D35K, P49A/P50D, K51E, and F53D) (Fig. 4A, bottom). The remaining 21 residues were divided into five groups, mt1 (yellow), mt2 (blue), mt3 (green), mt4 (orange), and mt5 (magenta) (Fig. 4A, bottom), and five mutant IP3R1 cDNAs in which all of the residues in each group were substituted to alanine were constructed. The Ca2+ release activities of the mutant channels were examined by measuring the B-cell receptor (BCR)-induced cytosolic Ca2+ increases (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B) in mutant IP3R-expressing cells established from R23-11 cells. We found that the Ca2+ increases were largely impaired in mt5-expressing cells (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B) despite sufficient amounts of protein expression (supplemental Fig. S2C). Thapsigargin-induced Ca2+ increases were observed in the mt5-expressing cells (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B), suggesting that the Ca2+ stores were intact. The mt5 mutant bound to IP3 with a Kd value of 18 ± 2 nm (Fig. 2 and supplemental Table SIII). These results suggest that the critical residues for channel gating are present in the five residues selected for mt5. To identify the specific residues critical for channel gating, we made three mutants (K144A/N145A, N213A, and Y167A/K168A) of full-le"
https://openalex.org/W2152568611,"Vertical transmission accounts for the majority of pediatric cases of hepatitis C viral (HCV) infection. In contrast to the adult population who develop persistent viremia in ∼80% of cases following exposure, the rate of mother-to-child transmission (2–6%) is strikingly low. Protection from vertical transmission likely requires the coordination of multiple components of the immune system. Placenta and decidua provide a direct connection between mother and infant. We hypothesized that innate immune responses would differ across the three compartments (decidua, placenta and cord blood) and that hepatitis C exposure would modify innate immunity in these tissues. The study was comprised of HCV-infected and healthy control mother and infant pairs from whom cord blood, placenta and decidua were collected with isolation of mononuclear cells. Multiparameter flow cytometry was performed to assess the phenotype, intracellular cytokine production and cytotoxicity of the cells. In keeping with a model where the maternal-fetal interface provides antiviral protection, we found a gradient in proportional frequencies of NKT and γδ-T cells being higher in placenta than cord blood. Cytotoxicity of NK and NKT cells was enhanced in placenta and placental NKT cytotoxicity was further increased by HCV infection. HCV exposure had multiple effects on innate cells including a decrease in activation markers (CD69, TRAIL and NKp44) on NK cells and a decrease in plasmacytoid dendritic cells in both placenta and cord blood of exposed infants. In summary, the placenta represents an active innate immunological organ that provides antiviral protection against HCV transmission in the majority of cases; the increased incidence in preterm labor previously described in HCV-seropositive mothers may be related to enhanced cytotoxicity of NKT cells."
https://openalex.org/W2061530118,"Background Epistasis, i.e., the interaction of alleles at different loci, is thought to play a central role in the formation and progression of complex diseases. The complexity of disease expression should arise from a complex network of epistatic interactions involving multiple genes. Methodology We develop a general model for testing high-order epistatic interactions for a complex disease in a case-control study. We incorporate the quantitative genetic theory of high-order epistasis into the setting of cases and controls sampled from a natural population. The new model allows the identification and testing of epistasis and its various genetic components. Conclusions Simulation studies were used to examine the power and false positive rates of the model under different sampling strategies. The model was used to detect epistasis in a case-control study of inflammatory bowel disease, in which five SNPs at a candidate gene were typed, leading to the identification of a significant three-locus epistasis."
https://openalex.org/W1985194119,"Activation of the ionotropic P2RX7 nucleotide receptor by extracellular ATP has been implicated in modulating inflammatory disease progression. Continuous exposure of P2RX7 to ligand can result in apoptosis in many cell types, including monocytic cells, whereas transient activation of P2RX7 is linked to inflammatory mediator production and the promotion of cell growth. Given the rapid hydrolysis of ATP in the circulation and interstitial space, transient activation of P2RX7 appears critically important for its action, yet its effects on gene expression are unclear. The present study demonstrates that short-term stimulation of human and mouse monocytic cells as well as mouse osteoblasts with P2RX7 agonists substantially induces the expression of several activating protein-1 (AP-1) members, particularly FosB. The potent activation of FosB after P2RX7 stimulation is especially noteworthy considering that little is known concerning the role of FosB in immunological regulation. Interestingly, the magnitude of FosB activation induced by P2RX7 stimulation appears greater than that observed with other known inducers of FosB expression. In addition, we have identified a previously unrecognized role for FosB in osteoblasts with respect to nucleotide-induced expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis from arachidonic acid and is critical for osteoblastic differentiation and immune behavior. The present studies are the first to link P2RX7 action to FosB/AP-1 regulation in multiple cell types, including a role in nucleotide-induced COX-2 expression, and support a role for FosB in the control of immune and osteogenic function by P2RX7.

One class of mediators known to be present at high concentrations in many inflammatory microenvironments is comprised of extracellular nucleotides (8Dubyak G.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Cell. 2005; 16: 3659-3665Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), which function as ligands for nucleotide receptors on the surface of a wide array of cell types. Interestingly, recent studies have revealed a role for nucleotide receptors as immune sensors of the disruption of homeostasis (12Di Virgilio F. Purinergic Signal. 2005; 1: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 13Khakh B.S. North R.A. Nature. 2006; 442: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). In this context, depending on the concentration and duration of extracellular ATP (eATP) exposure, nucleotide receptors influence the magnitude of a mounted innate immune response. In particular, activation of the ionotropic P2RX7 nucleotide receptor by eATP has been implicated in modulating inflammatory disease progression (12Di Virgilio F. Purinergic Signal. 2005; 1: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Lister M.F. Sharkey J. Sawatzky D.A. Hodgkiss J.P. Davidson D.J. Rossi A.G. Finlayson K. J. Inflamm.

Numerous reports have revealed a central role for P2RX7 in modulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced activation of monocytic cells (e.g. monocytes and macrophages), such as the processing and/or release of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-18, the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase, the production of nitric oxide, and the generation of reactive oxygen species (14Lister M.F.

Thus, P2RX7 activity affects a wide range of inflammatory events, especially with regard to monocytic cell function. Evidence for an in vivo role of P2RX7 in the progression of inflammatory disease has been obtained using animal models of arthritis wherein P2RX7 knock-out mice exhibit a reduced incidence and severity of anti-collagen-induced arthritic symptoms when compared with their littermate controls (20Labasi J.M. Petrushova N. Donovan C. McCurdy S. Lira P. Payette M.M. Brissette W. Wicks J.R. Audoly L. Gabel C.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6436-6445Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Also, analyses of the skeletal system of P2RX7-null mice has revealed that stimulation of periosteal bone growth by mechanical loading is markedly attenuated in these animals when compared with wild-type controls (21Li J. Liu D. Ke H.Z. Duncan R.L. Turner C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42952-42959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Notably, mechanical stimulation has been linked to ATP release from osteoblasts, the bone-forming cells of the skeletal system (22Romanello M. Pani B. Bicego M. D'Andrea P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 1275-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 23Buckley K.A. Golding S.L. Rice J.M. Dillon J.P. Gallagher J.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 1401-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), and P2RX7 is expressed by both osteoblasts and osteoclasts (cells responsible for the resorption of mineralized bone) (24Ke H.Z. J. Bone Miner. Metab. 2005; 23: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 25Orriss I.R. Knight G.E. Ranasinghe S. Burnstock G. Arnett T.R. Bone. 2006; 39: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), both of which are important in bone homeostasis and have an intimate relationship with the immune system (7Takayanagi H. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 292-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). For instance, osteoblast stimulation has been linked to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release, which is important for osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption (7Takayanagi H. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 292-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar) as well as in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (26McCoy J.M. Wicks J.R. Audoly L.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). In this context, eATP-induced PGE2 release from osteoblasts appears P2RX7-dependent (21Li J. Liu D. Ke H.Z. Duncan R.L. Turner C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42952-42959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Thus, there is strong evidence supporting a role for P2RX7 in osteoblast function, but the molecular mechanisms behind its activity remain largely unknown. Upon prolonged ligand exposure, P2RX7 activation has been associated with the passage of small molecules (<900 Da) through the plasma membrane via the formation of nonspecific pores (27North R.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 1013-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (2470) Google Scholar). As a consequence, continuous exposure (e.g. >30 min in human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells heterologously expressing P2RX7 (28Mackenzie A.B. Young M.T. Adinolfi E. Surprenant A. J. Biol.

In contrast, transient P2RX7 activation (e.g. <30 min in HEK-293 cells heterologously expressing P2RX7 (28Mackenzie A.B. Young M.T. Adinolfi E. Surprenant A. J. Biol.

Interestingly, a subset of cells expressing endogenous P2RX7, including microglia and osteoblasts, do not undergo apoptosis after prolonged agonist stimulation (33Li X. Qi X. Zhou L. Catera D.

Because cell death has been a major focus in the study of P2RX7 action, the capacity of P2RX7 to mediate other responses, such as changes in gene transcription, are less well defined and yet are likely important for cells that do not undergo apoptosis after P2RX7 activation. Such issues may be key in disease progression, and it is noteworthy that studies of global gene expression in P2RX7-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells reveal a difference in gene expression between pulmonary tuberculosis patients and control patients (35Franco-Martínez S. Niño-Moreno P. Bernal-Silva S. Baranda L. Rocha-Meza M. Portales-Cervantes L. Layseca-Espinosa E. González-Amaro R. Portales-Pérez D. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2006; 146: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In sum, P2RX7 stimulation likely mediates important alterations in gene expression, yet the molecular mechanisms by which these events occur are not well defined. We have previously shown that P2RX7-dependent activation of the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) leads to the expression of the AP-1 family member, c-Fos, in cells heterologously expressing P2RX7 (36Gavala M.L. Pfeiffer Z.A. Bertics P.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2008; 84: 1159-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This observation coupled with a study revealing that nucleotide treatment of cells heterologously expressing P2RX7 induces early growth factor-1 biosynthesis (37Stefano L. Rössler O.G. Griesemer D. Hoth M. Thiel G. J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 213: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) supports a role for P2RX7 activation in the induction of protein expression that is not dependent on co-stimulation with other immune modulators such as LPS. However, the induction of protein expression after either short-term or continuous stimulation of endogenous P2RX7 is poorly understood. In this regard the present study demonstrates that P2RX7 activation leads to the expression of the AP-1 family members FosB, c-Fos, and JunB in both a murine macrophage cell line and in primary human peripheral blood monocytes. This report is the first study to implicate P2RX7 in the activation of FosB and JunB in any system. These observations are also novel in that induction of FosB and JunB expression only requires transient stimulation of monocytic cells with P2RX7 agonists, which would circumvent P2RX7-mediated apoptosis of these cells. The induction of FosB after P2RX7 stimulation is noteworthy given its large magnitude (10–20-fold over basal versus 2–4-fold induction of FosB by PMA) and high sensitivity (as low as 10 μm BzATP compared with ≥100 μm BzATP for most other reported P2RX7-mediated events) when compared with other known inducers of this transcription factor. Short-term stimulation of P2RX7 was observed to induce FosB and JunB binding to AP-1 consensus oligonucleotides after BzATP treatment, indicating that these proteins are transcriptionally active in monocytic cells. The activation of FosB was not restricted to monocytic cells, as treatment of an osteoblastic cell line (MC3T3-E1) with P2RX7 agonists was also able to elicit FosB expression. A role for P2RX7-induced FosB in the induction of gene expression was also revealed, as treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells with a P2RX7 agonist could induce the FosB-dependent expression of COX-2, the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of prostaglandins such as PGE2, from arachidonic acid.

Murine MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were cultured in 10-cm tissue culture dishes at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Heparinized blood was drawn from healthy adult volunteers at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics (Madison, WI) in compliance with the requirements of the University of Wisconsin Health Sciences, Human Subjects Committee protocol. Blood-derived monocytes were purified from the heparinized blood as previously described (39Korpi-Steiner N.L. Bates M.E. Lee W.M. Hall D.J. Bertics P.J. J. Leukoc.

RAW 264.7 macrophages were plated at 3 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates and incubated at 37 °C for 16–24 h. After stimulation, cell viability was determined using the Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's specifications. This proliferation assay assesses metabolic activity by measuring the conversion of a tetrazolium compound to a soluble formazan as catalyzed by dehydrogenase enzymes found in metabolically active cells. Soluble formazan can be quantified spectrophotometrically at 490 nm. To determine FosB mRNA expression, cells were treated as indicated in the figure legend and lysed in TRIzol (Invitrogen). RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's protocols, and the levels of FosB mRNA were measured using quantitative RT-PCR. Primers directed toward murine FosB or 18 S (loading control) were designed using Beacon Design software. FosB primer, forward (AAGTGTGCTGTGGAGTTC) and reverse (ATGTTGGAAGTGGTCGA); 18 S primer, forward (GGACACGGACAGGATTGACAG) and reverse (ATCGCTCCACCAACTAAGAACG). Polymerase chain reactions were detected by SYBR green iQ supermix dye (Bio-Rad) and were performed using a My-iQ (Promega) real time thermal cycler (57–58 °C annealing temp, 40 cycles). After isolation, human blood-derived monocytes were plated at 2 × 106 cells/well in 12-well CoStar (Corning Inc.) plates, washed after 2 h with HBSS, and incubated at 37 °C for 16–24 h. RAW 264.7 macrophages and HEK-293 cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 - 5 × 105 cells/well in 24-well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37 °C for 16–24 h. For treatments that had short-term stimulation, cells were treated for 5 min, then washed twice with HBSS and incubated at 37 °C with fresh complete RAW media for the indicated times. After cell treatment and subsequent cell lysis with SDS sample buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm DTT, 2% SDS, and 20% glycerol), the protein content of each sample was determined using the Micro-BCA protein assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Immunoblotting was performed as previously described (36Gavala M.L. Pfeiffer Z.A. Bertics P.J. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2008; 84: 1159-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and each primary antibody was used according to the manufacturer's protocols. The membranes were visualized using the Epichemi II darkroom (UVP, Upland, CA) equipped with a 12-bit cooled CCD camera. Image processing and analyses were performed using ImageJ 1.33u (NIH). To control for variations in protein loading, the membranes were re-probed with antibodies that react with Grb2, β-tubulin, or pan-ERK1/2. For immunoblot normalization, band density from the primary protein of interest was divided by the band density from its respective loading control. RAW 264.7 cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture plates and incubated for 18–24 h before the start of the experiment. After the cells were treated, nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (40Aga M. Watters J.J. Pfeiffer Z.A. Wiepz G.J. Sommer J.A. Bertics P.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 286: C923-C930Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay according to manufacturer's specifications. Seven micrograms of nuclear protein extract per treatment were incubated with incubation buffer (40Aga M. Watters J.J. Pfeiffer Z.A. Wiepz G.J. Sommer J.A. Bertics P.J. Am. J. Physiol.

Extracts were then incubated for 20 min with the AP-1 oligonucleotide probe labeled with 1 × 105 cpm of [γ-32P]ATP. The complexes were then separated on 4% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and the migration of the labeled oligonucleotide was visualized by autoradiography. HEK-293 cells heterologously expressing human P2RX7 (HEK/P2RX7) were plated at 1 × 105 cells/well on collagen-I (Sigma)-coated 24-well plates one day before transfection.

Seventy-two hours post-transfection the cells were treated, lysed in SDS sample buffer, and assayed for FosB and COX-2 expression via immunoblotting. Student's two-tailed paired t tests (Figs. 1, 2, 4 (A and B), 5, 6, and 9) or two-way analysis of variance using the Holm-Sidak method (Figs. 3, 4C, and 7) were used to calculate the statistical differences between samples.

https://openalex.org/W2004407614,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, silent chromatin is formed at HMR upon the passage through S phase, yet neither the initiation of DNA replication at silencers nor the passage of a replication fork through HMR is required for silencing. Paradoxically, mutations in the DNA replication processivity factor, POL30, disrupt silencing despite this lack of requirement for DNA replication in the establishment of silencing. We tested whether pol30 mutants could establish silencing at either replicated or non-replicated HMR loci during S phase and found that pol30 mutants were defective in establishing silencing at HMR regardless of its replication status. Although previous studies tie the silencing defect of pol30 mutants to the chromatin assembly factors Asf1p and CAF-1, we found pol30 mutants did not exhibit a gross defect in packaging HMR into chromatin. Rather, the pol30 mutants exhibited defects in histone modifications linked to ASF1 and CAF-1-dependent pathways, including SAS-I- and Rtt109p-dependent acetylation events at H4-K16 and H3-K9 (plus H3-K56; Miller, A., Yang, B., Foster, T., and Kirchmaier, A. L. (2008) Genetics 179, 793–809). Additional experiments using FLIM-FRET revealed that Pol30p interacted with SAS-I and Rtt109p in the nuclei of living cells. However, these interactions were disrupted in pol30 mutants with defects linked to ASF1- and CAF-1-dependent pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2007670470,"There is a significant gap in our fundamental understanding of early morphological and migratory changes in human Langerhans cells (LCs) in response to vaccine stimulation. As the vast majority of LCs studies are conducted in small animal models, substantial interspecies variation in skin architecture and immunity must be considered when extrapolating the results to humans. This study aims to determine whether excised human skin, maintained viable in organ culture, provides a useful human model for measuring and understanding early immune response to intradermally delivered vaccine candidates. Excised human breast skin was maintained viable in air-liquid-interface organ culture. This model was used for the first time to show morphological changes in human LCs stimulated with influenza virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines delivered via intradermal injection. Immunohistochemistry of epidermal sheets and skin sections showed that LCs in VLP treated skin lost their typical dendritic morphology. The cells were more dispersed throughout the epidermis, often in close proximity to the basement membrane, and appeared vertically elongated. Our data provides for increased understanding of the complex morphological, spatial and temporal changes that occur to permit LC migration through the densely packed keratinocytes of the epidermis following exposure to vaccine. Significantly, the data not only supports previous animal data but also provides new and essential evidence of host response to this vaccination strategy in the real human skin environment."
https://openalex.org/W2063673655,"Multi-drug resistant Plasmodium falciparum is a major obstacle to malaria control and is emerging as a complex phenomenon. Mechanisms of drug evasion based on the intracellular extrusion of the drug and/or modification of target proteins have been described. However, cellular mechanisms related with metabolic activity have also been seen in eukaryotic systems, e.g. cancer cells. Recent observations suggest that such mechanism may occur in P. falciparum.We therefore investigated the effect of mefloquine exposure on the cell cycle of three P. falciparum clones (3D7, FCB, W2) with different drug susceptibilities, while investigating in parallel the expression of four genes coding for confirmed and putative drug transporters (pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfmrp1 and pfmrp2). Mefloquine induced a previously not described dose and clone dependent delay in the intra-erythrocytic cycle of the parasite. Drug impact on cell cycle progression and gene expression was then merged using a non-linear regression model to determine specific drug driven expression. This revealed a mild, but significant, mefloquine driven gene induction up to 1.5 fold.Both cell cycle delay and induced gene expression represent potentially important mechanisms for parasites to escape the effect of the antimalarial drug."
https://openalex.org/W2161199736,"Background Rnd3 (RhoE) protein belongs to the unique branch of Rho family GTPases that has low intrinsic GTPase activity and consequently remains constitutively active [1], [2]. The current consensus is that Rnd1 and Rnd3 function as important antagonists of RhoA signaling primarily by activating the ubiquitous p190 RhoGAP [3], but not by inhibiting the ROCK family kinases. Methodology/Principal Findings Rnd3 is abundant in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells and in an unbiased two-step affinity purification screen we identified a new Rnd3 target, termed synectin-binding RhoA exchange factor (Syx), by mass spectrometry. The Syx interaction with Rnd3 does not occur through the Syx DH domain but utilizes a region similar to the classic Raf1 Ras-binding domain (RBD), and most closely related to those in RGS12 and RGS14. We show that Syx behaves as a genuine effector of Rnd3 (and perhaps Rnd1), with binding characteristics similar to p190-RhoGAP. Morpholino-oligonucleotide knockdown of Syx in zebrafish at the one cell stage resulted in embryos with shortened anterior-posterior body axis: this phenotype was effectively rescued by introducing mouse Syx1b mRNA. A Rnd3-binding defective mutant of Syx1b mutated in the RBD (E164A/R165D) was more potent in rescuing the embryonic defects than wild-type Syx1b, showing that Rnd3 negatively regulates Syx activity in vivo. Conclusions/Significance This study uncovers a well defined Rnd3 effector Syx which is widely expressed and directly impacts RhoA activation. Experiments conducted in vivo indicate that Rnd3 negatively regulates Syx, and that as a RhoA-GEF it plays a key role in early embryonic cell shape changes. Thus a connection to signaling via the planar cell polarity pathway is suggested."

PTx has pleotropic effects on the immune system. This study was designed to investigate the effects of PTx administered intracerebroventricularly (icv) in preventing downstream immune cell infiltration and demyelination of the spinal cord.EAE was induced in C57BL/6 mice with MOG(35-55). PTx icv at seven days post MOG immunization resulted in mitigation of clinical motor symptoms, minimal T cell infiltration, and the marked absence of axonal loss and demyelination of the spinal cord. Integrity of the blood brain barrier was compromised in the brain whereas spinal cord BBB integrity remained intact. PTx icv markedly increased microglia numbers in the brain preventing their migration to the spinal cord. An in vitro transwell study demonstrated that PTx inhibited migration of microglia.Centrally administered PTx abrogated migration of microglia in EAE mice, limiting the inflammatory cytokine milieu to the brain and prevented dissemination of demyelination. The effects of PTx icv warrants further investigation and provides an attractive template for further study regarding the pleotropic effects of infectious elements such as PTx in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2004144491,"The PhoP and PhoR proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis form a highly specific two-component system that controls expression of genes involved in complex lipid biosynthesis and regulation of unknown virulence determinants. The several functions of PhoP are apportioned between a C-terminal effector domain (PhoPC) and an N-terminal receiver domain (PhoPN), phosphorylation of which regulates activation of the effector domain. Here we show that PhoPN, on its own, demonstrates PhoR-dependent phosphorylation. PhoPC, the truncated variant bearing the DNA binding domain, binds in vitro to the target site with affinity similar to that of the full-length protein. To complement the finding that residues spanning Met(1) to Arg(138) of PhoP constitute the minimal functional PhoPN, we identified Arg(150) as the first residue of the distal PhoPC domain capable of DNA binding on its own, thereby identifying an interdomain linker. However, coupling of two functional domains together in a single polypeptide chain is essential for phosphorylation-coupled DNA binding by PhoP. We discuss consequences of tethering of two domains on DNA binding and demonstrate that linker length and not individual residues of the newly identified linker plays a critical role in regulating interdomain interactions. Together, these results have implications for the molecular mechanism of transmission of conformation change associated with phosphorylation of PhoP that results in the altered DNA recognition by the C-terminal domain."
https://openalex.org/W1964355682,"Coronin is a conserved actin-binding protein that co-functions with ADF/cofilin and Arp2/3 complex to govern cellular actin dynamics. Despite emerging roles for coronin in a range of physiological processes and disease states, a detailed understanding of the molecular interactions of coronin with actin and other binding partners has been lacking. Here, we performed a systematic mutational analysis of surfaces on the yeast coronin β-propeller domain, which binds to F-actin and is conserved in all coronin family members. We generated 21 mutant alleles and analyzed their biochemical effects on actin binding and ADF/cofilin activity. Conserved actin-binding residues mapped to a discrete ridge stretching across one side of the β-propeller. Mutants defective in actin binding showed loss of synergy with ADF/cofilin in severing filaments, diminished localization to actin structures in vivo, and loss of coronin overexpression growth defects. In addition, one allele showed normal actin binding but impaired functional interactions with ADF/cofilin. Another allele showed normal actin binding but failed to cause coronin overexpression defects. Together, these results indicate that actin binding is critical for many of the biochemical and cellular functions of coronin and that the β-propeller domain mediates additional functional interactions with ADF/cofilin and possibly other ligands. Conservation of the actin-binding surfaces across distant species and in all three major classes of coronin isoforms suggests that the nature of the coronin-actin association may be similar in other family members."

Their counter-receptors, CD48 and CD58, are also expressed on the NK cell surface, raising a question about the functional consequences of potential 2B4/CD48 and CD2/CD58 interactions. Using blocking antibodies specific to each receptor, we demonstrated that both 2B4/CD48 and CD2/CD58 interactions were essential for the development of NK effector functions: cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion. However, only 2B4/CD48, but not CD2/CD58, interactions were shown to be critical for the optimal NK cell proliferation in response to interleukin (IL)-2. IL-2-activated NK cells cultured in the absence of 2B4/CD48 or CD2/CD58 interactions were severely impaired for their ability to induce intracellular calcium mobilization and subsequent ERK activation upon tumor target exposure, suggesting that the early signaling pathway of NK receptors leading to impaired cytolysis and interferon (IFN)-γ secretion was inhibited. Nevertheless, these defects did not fully account for the reduced proliferation of NK cells in the absence of 2B4/CD48 interactions, because anti-CD2 or anti-CD58 monoclonal antibody (mAb)-treated NK cells, showing defective signaling and effector functions, displayed normal proliferation upon IL-2 stimulation. These results propose the signaling divergence between pathways leading to cell proliferation and cytotoxicity/cytokine release, which can be differentially regulated by 2B4 and CD2 during IL-2-driven NK cell activation.

https://openalex.org/W1965879054,"Background The Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) mediates cellular adaptations to low oxygen. Prolyl-4-hydroxylases are oxygen sensors that hydroxylate the HIF alpha-subunit, promoting its proteasomal degradation in normoxia. Three HIF-prolyl hydroxylases, encoded by independent genes, PHD1, PHD2, and PHD3, occur in mammals. PHD2, the longest PHD isoform includes a MYND domain, whose biochemical function is unclear. PHD2 and PHD3 genes are induced in hypoxia to shut down HIF dependent transcription upon reoxygenation, while expression of PHD1 is oxygen-independent. The physiologic significance of the diversity of the PHD oxygen sensors is intriguing. Methodology and Principal Findings We have analyzed the Drosophila PHD locus, fatiga, which encodes 3 isoforms, FgaA, FgaB and FgaC that are originated through a combination of alternative initiation of transcription and alternative splicing. FgaA includes a MYND domain and is homologous to PHD2, while FgaB and FgaC are shorter isoforms most similar to PHD3. Through a combination of genetic experiments in vivo and molecular analyses in cell culture, we show that fgaB but not fgaA is induced in hypoxia, in a Sima-dependent manner, through a HIF-Responsive Element localized in the first intron of fgaA. The regulatory capacity of FgaB is stronger than that of FgaA, as complete reversion of fga loss-of-function phenotypes is observed upon transgenic expression of the former, and only partial rescue occurs after expression of the latter. Conclusions and Significance Diversity of PHD isoforms is a conserved feature in evolution. As in mammals, there are hypoxia-inducible and non-inducible Drosophila PHDs, and a fly isoform including a MYND domain co-exists with isoforms lacking this domain. Our results suggest that the isoform devoid of a MYND domain has stronger regulatory capacity than that including this domain."

https://openalex.org/W2076533369,"The lifetime of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) is increased from <1 day to >1 week during early postnatal development. However, the exact timing of AChR stabilization is not known, and its correlation to the concurrent embryonic to adult AChR channel conversion, NMJ remodeling, and neuromuscular diseases is unclear. Using a novel time lapse in vivo imaging technology we show that replacement of the entire receptor population of an individual NMJ occurs end plate-specifically within hours. This makes it possible to follow directly in live animals changing stabilities of end plate receptors. In three different, genetically modified mouse models we demonstrate that the metabolic half-life values of synaptic AChRs increase from a few hours to several days after postnatal day 6. Developmental stabilization is independent of receptor subtype and apparently regulated by an intrinsic muscle-specific maturation program. Myosin Va, an F-actin-dependent motor protein, is also accumulated synaptically during postnatal development and thus could mediate the stabilization of end plate AChR.

https://openalex.org/W2078111433,"In an increasingly global society and economy, education and training beyond compulsory primary and secondary education—especially in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)—is essential to a nation's competitiveness and its standard of living. Community colleges, originally developed at the turn of the 20th century as open-admissions junior colleges and offering the first two years of a baccalaureate education, help meet this need. These colleges have evolved into comprehensive institutions, preparing students to transfer to upper-division universities or to enter the workforce directly. Enrolling 43% of all U.S. undergraduates ( 1 ), community colleges play important roles in developing public scientific literacy, educating scientists and engineers, and addressing the nation's need for well-prepared technicians ( 2 ). But challenges remain."
https://openalex.org/W2166924456,"Genome maintenance is ensured by a variety of biochemical sensors and pathways that repair accumulated damage. During mitosis, the mechanisms that sense and resolve DNA damage remain elusive. Studies have demonstrated that damage accumulated on lagging chromosomes can activate the spindle assembly checkpoint. However, there is little known regarding damage to DNA after anaphase onset. In this study, we demonstrate that laser-induced damage to chromosome tips (presumptive telomeres) in anaphase of Potorous tridactylis cells (PtK2) inhibits cytokinesis. In contrast, equivalent irradiation of non-telomeric chromosome regions or control irradiations in either the adjacent cytoplasm or adjacent to chromosome tips near the spindle midzone during anaphase caused no change in the eventual completion of cytokinesis. Damage to only one chromosome tip caused either complete absence of furrow formation, a prolonged delay in furrow formation, or furrow regression. When multiple chromosome tips were irradiated in the same cell, the cytokinesis defects increased, suggesting a potential dose-dependent mechanism. These results suggest a mechanism in which dysfunctional telomeres inhibit mitotic exit."
