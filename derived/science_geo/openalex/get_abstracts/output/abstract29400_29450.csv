https://openalex.org/W2040113209,"Humans who have inherited the human class I major histocompatibility allele HLA-B27 have a markedly increased risk of developing the multi-organ system diseases termed spondyloarthropathies. To investigate the role of B27 in these disorders, we introduced the B27 and human beta 2-microglobulin genes into rats, a species known to be quite susceptible to experimentally induced inflammatory disease. Rats from one transgenic line spontaneously developed inflammatory disease involving the gastrointestinal tract, peripheral and vertebral joints, male genital tract, skin, nails, and heart. This pattern of organ system involvement showed a striking resemblance to the B27-associated human disorders. These results establish that B27 plays a central role in the pathogenesis of the multi-organ system processes of the spondyloarthropathies. Elucidation of the role of B27 should be facilitated by this transgenic model."

https://openalex.org/W2087179850,"The mammalian olfactory system may transduce odorant information via a G protein-mediated adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) cascade. A newly discovered adenylyl cyclase, termed type III, has been cloned, and its expression was localized to olfactory neurons. The type III protein resides in the sensory neuronal cilia, which project into the nasal lumen and are accessible to airborne odorants. The enzymatic activity of the type III adenylyl cyclase appears to differ from nonsensory cyclases. The large difference seen between basal and stimulated activity for the type III enzyme could allow considerable modulation of the intracellular cAMP concentration. This property may represent one mechanism of achieving sensitivity in odorant perception."

https://openalex.org/W2051440844,"The C. elegans gene unc-86 is required in several distinct neuroblast lineages for daughter cells to become different from their mothers, and is also required for the specification of particular neural identities. Consistent with the fact that unc-86 encodes a POU domain protein, we find that the unc-86 protein is localized to the nucleus. In the affected lineages, unc-86 protein appears within a few minutes after cell division in the nuclei of those daughter cells that are transformed by unc-86 mutations. Thus, expression of unc-86 protein is dependent on cell lineage. unc-86 protein is not asymmetrically segregated at further divisions. unc-86 protein also appears shortly after cell division in the nuclei of particular identified differentiating neurons; at least some of these neurons are nonfunctional in unc-86 mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2046862217,"Safety assessments of technological systems, such as nuclear power plants, chemical process facilities, and hazardous waste repositories, require the investigation of the occurrence and consequences of rare events. The subjectivistic (Bayesian) theory of probability is the appropriate framework within which expert opinions, which are essential to the quantification process, can be combined with experimental results and statistical observations to produce quantitative measures of the risks from these systems. A distinction is made between uncertainties in physical models and state-of-knowledge uncertainties about the parameters and assumptions of these models. The proper role of past and future relative frequencies and several issues associated with elicitation and use of expert opinions are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2102340487,"The Drosophila ncd gene is required for chromosome segregation during female meiosis. Previous analyses suggested that the ncd gene encoded a protein with sequence similarity to the kinesin motor domain, which suggested that, like kinesin, the ncd protein might be a plus end-directed microtubule motor. Here we describe the expression of ncd protein in E. coli and the initial characterization of the ncd protein's motor properties. The ncd protein is indeed a microtubule motor, but the polarity of movement is minus end directed. The ncd protein also has microtubule bundling activity. These findings limit possible models for the in vivo functions of the ncd protein and suggest that motor proteins with similar sequence can generate movement in opposite directions along a microtubule."
https://openalex.org/W2075687309,"We show that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence of one putative Ca2+ binding motif of the cell adhesion molecule uvomorulin is able to complex Ca2+. This function is abolished if the first Asp in the peptide is replaced by Lys. Accordingly, we expressed in L cells mutant uvomorulin with a replacement of Asp to Lys or Ala. Mutant protein was resistant to Ca2+/trypsin under mild conditions but became susceptible at or near the site of replacement at higher concentrations, leaving the remaining Ca2+ binding domains protected. Remarkably, in cell aggregation assays both mutant uvomorulins failed to mediate cell adhesiveness, demonstrating that a single amino acid substitution in one Ca2+ binding site inactivates the adhesive function."
https://openalex.org/W1977625601,"We demonstrate that during the courtship stage of conjugation, S. cerevisiae a cells choose the alpha cell producing the highest level of pheromone from among potential mating partners. From this result and that for alpha cells we conclude that both a and alpha cells act as signaling cells during courtship, that both cell types respond by discriminating different levels of signal, and that the signals are the mating pheromones. Responding cells that are supersensitive to signal fail to discriminate pheromone-producing from nonproducing cells to an extent that depends on their degree of supersensitivity. We propose that partner selection in S. cerevisiae results from polarized morphogenesis of a responding cell in the direction of highest pheromone concentration and that cells defective in discriminating this gradient execute a default pathway in which an adjacent cell is selected at random."
https://openalex.org/W1972617251,"The polymerization of actin filaments is involved in growth, movement, and cell division. It has been shown that actin polymerization is controlled by gelsolin, whose interactions with actin are activated by calcium ion (Ca2+) and inhibited by membrane polyphosphoinositides (PPI). A smaller Ca2(+)- and PPI-regulated protein, gCap39, which has 49% sequence identity with gelsolin, has been identified by cDNA cloning and protein purification. Like gelsolin, gCap39 binds to the fast-growing (+) end of actin filaments. However, gCap39 does not sever actin filaments and can respond to Ca2+ and PPI transients independently, under conditions in which gelsolin is ineffective. The coexistence of gCap39 with gelsolin should allow precise regulation of actin assembly at the leading edge of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1599264286,"Expression of the glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs), GRP78 and GRP94, is induced by a variety of stress conditions including treatment of cells with tunicamycin or the calcium ionophore A23187. The stimulus for induction of these resident endoplasmic reticulum (ER) proteins appears to be accumulation of misfolded or underglycosylated protein within the ER. We have studied the induction of mRNAs encoding two other resident ER proteins, ERp72 and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), during the stress response in Chinese hamster ovary cells. ERp72 shares amino acid sequence homology with PDI within the presumed catalytic active sites. ERp72 mRNA and, to a lesser degree, PDI mRNA were induced by treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells with tunicamycin or A23187. These results identify ERp72 as a member of the GRP family. Stable high level overproduction of ERp72 or PDI from recombinant expression vectors did not alter the constitutive or induced expression of other GRPs. High level overexpression resulted in secretion of the overproduced protein specifically but not other resident ER proteins. This suggests that the ER retention mechanism is mediated by more specific interactions than just KDEL sequence recognition."
https://openalex.org/W1605533832,"The conformational stability and reversibility of unfolding of the human dimeric enzyme Cu Zn superoxide dismutase (HSOD) and the three mutant enzymes constructed by replacement of Cys6 by Ala and Cys111 by Ser, singly and in combination, were determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The differential scanning calorimetry profile of wild-type HSOD consists of two components, which probably represent the unfolding of the oxidized and reduced forms of the enzyme, with denaturation temperatures (Tm) of 74.9 and 83.6 degrees C, approximately 7 degrees lower than those for bovine superoxide dismutase (BSOD). The conformational stabilities of the two components of the mutant HSOD's differ only slightly from those of the wild type (delta delta Gs of -0.2 to +0.8 kcal/mol of dimer), while replacement of the BSOD Cys6 by Ala is somewhat destabilizing (delta delta G of -0.7 to -1.3 kcal/mol of dimer). These small alterations in conformational stability do not correlate with the large increases in resistance to thermal inactivation following substitution of free Cys in both HSOD and BSOD (McRee, D.E., Redford, S.M., Getzoff, E.D., Lepock, J.R., Hallewell, R.A., and Tainer, J.A. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 14234-14241 and Hallewell, R.A., Imlay, K.C., Laria, I., Gallegos, C., Fong, N., Irvine, B., Getzoff, E.D., Tainer, J.A., Cubelli, D.E., Bielski, B.H.J., Olson, P., Mallenbach, G.T., and Cousens, L.S. (1991) Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet., submitted for publication). The reversibility of unfolding was determined by scanning part way through the profile, cooling, rescanning, and calculating the amount of protein irreversibly unfolded by the first scan. The order of reversibility at a constant level of unfolding is the same as the order of resistance to inactivation for both the HSOD and BSOD wild-type and mutant enzymes. Thus, the greater resistance to thermal inactivation of the superoxide dismutase enzymes with free Cys replaced by Ala or Ser is dominated by a greater resistance to irreversible unfolding and relatively unaffected by changes in conformational stability."
https://openalex.org/W1982239455,"The regulatory photoreceptor, phytochrome, controls the expression of numerous genes, including its own phyA genes, which are transcriptionally repressed in response to light. Functional analysis of a rice phyA gene promoter, by means of microprojectile-mediated gene transfer, indicates that a GT motif, GCGGTAATT, closely related to elements in the promoters of a number of other light-regulated genes, is critical for expression. Partial complementary DNA clones have been obtained for a rice nuclear protein, designated GT-2, that binds in a highly sequence-specific fashion to this motif. Mutational analysis shows that the paired G's are most crucial to binding. GT-2 has domains related to certain other transcription factors. Northern blot analysis shows that GT-2 messenger RNA levels decline in white light although red and far red light pulses are ineffective."
https://openalex.org/W2038571269,"The binding of a 13C-labeled cyclosporin A (CsA) analog to cyclophilin (peptidyl prolyl isomerase) was examined by means of isotope-edited nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. A trans 9,10 peptide bond was adopted when CsA was bound to cyclophilin, in contrast to the cis 9,10 peptide bond found in the crystalline and solution conformations of CsA. Furthermore, nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) were observed between the zeta 3 and epsilon 3 protons of the methylleucine (MeLeu) residue at position 9 of CsA and tryptophan121 (Trp121) and phenylalanine (Phe) protons of cyclophilin, suggesting that the MeLeu9 residue of CsA interacts with cyclophilin. These results illustrate the power of isotope-edited NMR techniques for rapidly providing useful information about the conformations and active site environment of inhibitors bound to their target enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1678687940,"A chimeric gene consisting of the coding sequence for the membrane domain of the endoplasmic reticulum protein, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, fused to the coding sequence for the soluble enzyme, beta-galactosidase of Escherichia coli, has been previously constructed. This fusion protein, HMGal, has been localized to the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with this chimeric gene, and its beta-galactosidase activity has declined in the presence of low density lipoprotein (Skalnik, D. G., Narita, H., Kent, C., and Simoni, R. D. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6836-6841). In this report, we demonstrate that the loss of beta-galactosidase activity results from the accelerated degradation of the HMGal protein. Taking advantage of a fluorescence-activated cell sorter technique, we have selected transfected cells which express sufficient levels of HMGal to improve its immunodetection. Based on pulse-chase experiments, the half-life of HMGal is 6.0 h, and, in the presence of 20 mM mevalonate, the half-life declines 1.7-fold. Under these conditions, mevalonate accelerates the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase in these cells 1.6-fold, from 8.4 h to 5.3 h, most probably by the same mechanism. This mevalonate-regulated degradation of HMGal is not due to a heteromeric association of HMGal with reductase, since the same effect has been observed in cells lacking the reductase protein. In addition, we demonstrate that inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide abolishes the mevalonate-dependent accelerated degradation of HMGal, in agreement with previous studies which have presented indirect evidence that a short-lived protein is essential for mediating the loss of HMG-CoA reductase activity. Finally, using brefeldin A, we show that the mevalonate-dependent accelerated degradation of HMGal may occur in the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1606246362,"Nephrotoxic cysteine conjugates kill cells after they are metabolized by the enzyme cysteine conjugate beta-lyase to reactive fragments which bind to cellular macromolecules. We have investigated the cellular events which occur after the binding and lead ultimately to cell death in renal epithelial cells. Using S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-L-cysteine (DCVC) as a model conjugate, we found that the phenolic antioxidants N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPPD), butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, propyl galate, and butylated hydroxyquinone, and the iron chelator deferoxamine inhibited the cytotoxicity significantly. Among the five antioxidants, DPPD was most potent. DPPD blocked DCVC toxicity over an extended time period, and the rescued cells remained functional as measured by protein synthetic activity. DPPD was able to block the toxicity of two other toxic cysteine conjugates S-(2-chloro-1,1,2-trifluoroethyl)-L-cysteine and S-(1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl)-L-cysteine. In addition to LLC-PK1 cells, DPPD also protected freshly isolated rat kidney epithelial cells in suspension and in primary culture. In suspension cells, DPPD was effective at low doses of DCVC (25-50 microM) but not at high concentrations (250-500 microM). DPPD inhibition was not due to an inactivation of beta-lyase or a decrease in the binding of [35S]DCVC metabolites to cellular macromolecules and occurred at a step after the activation of the toxins. During DCVC treatment, lipid peroxidation products were detectable prior to cell death. DPPD blocked lipid peroxidation over the whole time course. Depletion of nonprotein thiols also occurred prior to cell death. DPPD did not prevent the loss of nonprotein thiols. However, the sulfhydryl-reducing agent DTT blocked lipid peroxidation and toxicity at a step after the activation of DCVC. Therefore, it appears that cysteine conjugates kill renal epithelial cells by a combination of covalent binding, depletion of nonprotein thiols, and lipid peroxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1598717489,"Using fluorescence spectroscopy, we have demonstrated that isolated envelope membranes from mature spinach chloroplasts catalyze the phototransformation of endogenous protochlorophyllide into chlorophyllide in presence of NADPH, but not in presence of NADH. Protochlorophyllide reductase was characterized further using monospecific antibodies (anti-protochlorophyllide reductase) raised against the purified enzyme from oat. In mature spinach chloroplasts, protochlorophyllide reductase is present only in envelope membranes. We have demonstrated that the envelope protochlorophyllide reductase, a 37,000-dalton polypeptide, is only a minor envelope component and is present on the outer surface of the outer envelope membrane. This conclusion is supported by several lines of evidence: (a) the envelope polypeptide that was immunodecorated with anti-protochlorophyllide reductase can be distinguished from the major 37,000-dalton envelope polypeptide E37 (which was identified by monospecific antibodies) only after two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; (b) the envelope protochlorophyllide reductase was hydrolyzed when isolated intact chloroplasts were incubated in presence of thermolysin; and (c) isolated intact chloroplasts strongly agglutinate when incubated in presence of antibodies raised against protochlorophyllide reductase. These results demonstrate that major differences exist between chloroplasts and etioplasts with respect to protochlorophyllide reductase levels and localization. The presence on the chloroplast envelope membrane of both the substrate (protochlorophyllide) and the enzyme (protochlorophyllide reductase) necessary for chlorophyllide synthesis could have major implications for the understanding of chlorophyll biosynthesis in mature chloroplasts."
https://openalex.org/W2060916451,"A particular outer membrane fraction previously defined as possessing specific affinity for the hemimethylated form of the origin of replication of the E. coli chromosome (oriC) is shown to inhibit the initiation of DNA synthesis at this site on hemimethylated DNA templates in vitro. The replication of fully methylated or unmethylated DNA templates is not affected. Also, no inhibition is observed if initiation takes place at random sites on the hemimethylated template. The key inactivation step appears to be membrane inhibition of DnaA initiator protein binding to oriC. Remethylation of the membrane-bound hemimethylated DNA results in reactivation. Our results demonstrate direct involvement of the membrane in the control of DNA replication. We propose that association/dissociation of the origin from the cell membrane is one of the control elements governing interintiation times in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W1645291095,"Effects of dephosphorylation on interactions of neurofilaments (NFs) with microtubules (MTs) were studied by the cosedimentation method. Centrifugation conditions were chosen so that MTs pelleted but NFs did not. While NFs isolated from bovine spinal cords did not cosediment with MTs polymerized in the presence of taxol, NFs dephosphorylated with Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase began to coprecipitate with MTs. The dephosphorylated NFs bound to MTs but not to the unpolymerized tubulin dimer. The binding was not observed in the presence of high salt or with MTs containing microtubule-associated proteins. The cosedimentation experiments using purified NF subunit proteins showed that the dephosphorylation-induced binding of NFs to MTs was mediated by the largest subunit of NF (NF-H). Negative staining electron microscopy confirmed bindings of the dephosphorylated NFs and NF-H to MTs. Densitometric measurement of the bound and unbound NF-H after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the binding of the dephosphorylated NF-H to MT was saturable and gave the following binding parameters. Approximately 1 mol of NF-H bound per 10 mol of tubulin dimer with a high affinity site (Kd = 3.8 x 10(-8) M) and per 16 mol of tubulin dimer with a low affinity site (Kd = 1.1 x 10(-7) M)."
https://openalex.org/W1554928505,"The interaction of alpha-thrombin with the hirudin (HV1) fragment N alpha-acetyl desulfo hirudin45-65 (P51) was investigated. Kinetic analysis revealed that P51 inhibits the proteolysis of a tripeptidyl substrate with Ki = 0.72 +/- 0.13 and 0.11 +/- 0.03 microM for bovine and human alpha-thrombins, respectively. The inhibition was partially competitive, affecting substrate binding to the enzyme-inhibitor complex by a factor alpha = 2 (bovine) and alpha = 4 (human) characteristic of hyperbolic inhibitors. P51 also inhibited thrombin-induced fibrin clot formation with IC50 values of 0.94 +/- 0.20 and 0.058 +/- 0.006 microM for bovine and human alpha-thrombins, respectively. The enhanced antithrombin activity for human thrombin could be attributed to species variations in the putative auxiliary anion exosite since N alpha-acetyl desulfo hirudin55-65 displayed the same rank order of potency shift in a clotting assay without inhibiting the amidolytic activity of either enzyme. From these observations, a potent thrombin inhibitor was designed having modified residues corresponding to the P1 and P3 recognition sites. N alpha-Acetyl[D-Phe45, Arg47] hirudin45-65 (P53) emerged as a pure competitive inhibitor with a Ki = 2.8 +/- 0.9 nM and IC50 = 4.0 +/- 0.8 nM (human alpha-thrombin) and is designated as a bifunctional inhibitor. Its enhanced potency could be explained by a cooperative intramolecular interaction between the COOH-terminal domain of the inhibitor and the auxiliary exosite of thrombin on the one hand, and the modified NH2-terminal residues with the catalytic site on the other."
https://openalex.org/W1499471108,"Interactions between extracellular fibronectin and vascular cells are thought to influence the phenotype of those cells. To determine if changes in fibronectin expression accompany the phenotypic changes of vascular tissue characteristic of experimental hypertension, steady state mRNA levels for fibronectin were determined in aortae of normotensive and hypertensive rats. A 3-6-fold increase in fibronectin mRNA was observed in aortic tissue of hypertensive rats following 3 weeks of treatment with deoxycorticosterone and salt, whereas if rats were treated only with deoxycorticosterone or salt alone, no changes occurred. The changes were reversed by normalization of blood pressure. The increases observed were localized to aorta and not to the periaortic tissue. Angiotensin II infusion using osmotic minipumps also caused an increase in fibronectin expression. Age-dependent increases in aortic fibronectin mRNA occurred in several rat strains, and the combined effects of hypertension and aging were greater than either variable alone. A clear distinction between the expression of fibronectin mRNA and that for collagen or tropoelastin were found in hypertensive and aging models. Aortic fibronectin was also increased in the hypertensive rats as determined by Western blot analysis. The findings indicate that elevation in blood pressure increases fibronectin expression in rat aorta and suggest that such changes may influence the aortic cellular responses to hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W1565531261,"We compared the ability of rat glomerular mesangial cells and LLC-PK1 cells to take up Cd2+ from solution. The former are smooth muscle-like cells of mesenchymal origin, the latter an established line of proximal tubular epithelium. Both cells, as well as primary glomerular epithelia, accumulated Cd2+ against a concentration gradient in a time-dependent manner. Uptake by mesangial cells obeyed a Michaelis model with an apparent Km of 19 microM and could be described by an initial rapid step of surface binding followed by rate-limiting internalization. In contrast, uptake by LLC-PK1 cells was non-saturable under accessible concentrations of Cd2+ and internalization was not a necessary consequence of association with the cell surface. In several other cell types, Cd2+ uptake has been shown to be inhibited by blockage of cell-surface sulfhydryl groups. In contrast, uptake by neither mesangial nor LLC-PK1 cells was depressed by N-ethylmaleimide, which actually enhanced the surface binding and to a lesser extent the uptake by the LLC-PK1 cell line. Neither depended on metabolic energy for uptake or utilized Ca2+ channels. The internalization process was temperature dependent and was obliterated at 2 degrees C. In mesangial cells, this allowed direct observation of the internalization event from a presaturated surface pool. The rate of this process was consistent with the Vmax calculated from the Michaelis model. Surface binding and uptake were decreased by binding of Cd2+ to serum proteins and albumin and were much less dependent on the presence of low molecular weight components of serum. Therefore, these cells may be especially sensitive to Cd2+ at concentrations encountered in vivo because of the low protein content of the plasma ultrafiltrate. Surface binding of Cd2+ to mesangial cells was suppressed by competing divalent ions following the order of the Irving-Williams series (Mn less than Co less than Ni less than Cu greater than Zn), although Zn2+ showed the greatest effect on internalization. In LLC-PK1 cells, Zn2+ and Cu2+ were both effective in decreasing Cd2+ uptake. We conclude that Cd2+ uptake by the tubular epithelial cells is rapid and independent of specific cell surface interactions, whereas uptake by rat mesangial cells follows binding to a specific surface ligand saturating at about 1.5 x 10(7) copies/cell. In both types of cells the uptake appears quite specific for Cd2+ and shows some cross-reactivity with other metal cations explicable by competitive ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W1497151332,"cDNA clones coding for the regulatory subunit (RII beta) of type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase were isolated from a bovine brain cDNA expression library in lambda gt11. The cDNA codes for a protein of 418 amino acids which is 98% homologous to the rat and human RII beta proteins. A series of expression vectors coding for truncated RII beta proteins were constructed in pATH plasmids and fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies made against purified bovine brain RII were immunoreactive with the fusion proteins on Western blots. The expressed RII beta-fusion proteins were used in overlay assays to identify the region in RII beta which binds to microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) and to the 75,000-dalton calmodulin-binding protein (P75) (Sarkar, D., Erlichman, J., and Rubin, C.S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 9844-9846) in bovine brain. Fusion protein containing amino acids 1-50 of the RII beta NH2 terminus (RII beta(1-50)] bound to both MAP2 and P75 immobilized on nitrocellulose filters. A pATH11-directed fusion protein containing the 31 amino acid RII-binding site of the human MAP2 protein (MAP2(31)) (Rubino, H.M., Dammerman, M., Shafit-Zagardo, B., and Erlichman, J. (1989) Neuron 3, 631-638) also bound RII beta-fusion proteins containing RII beta amino acids 1-50. Three fusion proteins, RII beta(1-25), RII beta(25-96), and RII beta(1-265,25-96 deleted) did not bind to MAP2(31) nor P75. The results showed that the binding domain for MAP2 and P75 was located within the NH2-terminal 50 amino acids of RII beta. Preincubation of bovine heart protein kinase II alpha and RII beta(1-50) with MAP2(31) prevented their binding to both P75 and MAP2(31) that were immobilized on nitrocellulose, suggesting that the binding sites for MAP2 and P75 are located near each other or that the same site on RII was binding to both proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1524780880,"Abstract Deaminated neuraminic acid-rich glycoprotein (KDN-gp), first found and isolated from the vitelline envelope of rainbow trout eggs (Inoue, S., Kanamori, A., Kitajima, K., and Inoue, Y. (1988) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 153, 172-176), has been found to contain a number of O-linked glycan. Oligosaccharides were released by alkaline borohydride treatment of KDN-gp. Following fractionation by DEAE-Sephadex A-25 and thin-layer chromatography, a series of acidic oligosaccharides were obtained and analyzed for their chemical structures. The structure is based on composition analysis, methylation analysis, alkali-catalyzed peeling reactions, periodate oxidation, 400-MHz one- and two-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy, and molecular secondary ion mass spectrometry. The O-linked oligosaccharides isolated from KDN-gp have been shown to contain a common core trisaccharide Gal beta 1-3GalNAc alpha 1-3GalNAc in which the terminal Gal residue is blocked by a single residue of deaminated neuraminic acid (KDN) and the proximal GalNAc residue is substituted by alpha-2,8-linked oligo(KDN) chains. Structures of KDN-oligosaccharide chains in the glycoprotein are novel and expressed by the following general formula, where n = 0-5, for which data are available. [formula: see text]"
https://openalex.org/W1556115207,"New methods for the analysis of glucose transporters were used to analyze the molecular mechanisms involved in the insulin-antagonistic effects of growth hormone (GH), which is known as a diabetogenic hormone. The ability of GH to alter the number and mRNA levels of two different glucose transporters in cultured 3T3-F442A adipocytes was investigated using specific antibodies and cDNA probes. At concentrations of GH as low as 0.5 and 5 ng/ml and at incubation times as short as 4 h, GH decreased rates of 2-deoxyglucose uptake in 3T3-F442A adipocytes. 3-O-Methyl-D-glucose uptake was inhibited to an extent similar to that of 2-deoxyglucose uptake (60-80%) after a 24-h incubation with GH (500 ng/ml), indicating that GH inhibits glucose metabolism specifically at the step of glucose transport. To determine whether reduced rates of glucose transport might result from reduced numbers of glucose transporters, whole cell lysates were prepared from GH-treated cells and subjected to immunoblotting using antibodies that identify Glut 1 (HepG2/rat brain) and Glut 4 (muscle/adipose) transporters. GH caused a time- and dose-dependent decrease in the number of Glut 1 transporters in the cell. Northern and slot-blot analyses showed a GH-induced dose-dependent decrease in levels of Glut 1 mRNA. In contrast, levels of Glut 4 transporter and mRNA were unchanged by GH. These data suggest that GH regulates Glut 1 and Glut 4 transporters differentially and that it exerts its inhibitory effect on glucose uptake at least in part by decreasing the synthesis of Glut 1 transporters. These studies provide the first evidence that GH regulates a key gene in metabolic regulation and can interfere with gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1678861403,"To investigate the role of the Ca2(+)-specific (I and II) sites of fast skeletal muscle troponin C (TnC) in the regulation of contraction, we have produced two TnC mutants which have lost the ability to bind Ca2+ at either site I (VG1) or at site II (VG2). Both mutants were able to partially restore force to TnC-depleted skinned muscle fibers (approximately 25% for VG1 and approximately 50% for VG2). In contrast, bovine cardiac TnC (BCTnC), which like VG1 binds Ca2+ only at site II, could fully reactivate the contraction of TnC-depleted fibers. Higher concentrations of both mutants were required to restore force to the TnC-depleted fibers than with wild type TnC (WTnC) or BCTnC. VG1 and VG2 substituted fibers could not bind additional WTnC, indicating that all of the TnC-binding sites were saturated with the mutant TnC's. The Ca2+ concentration required for force activation was much higher for VG1 and VG2 substituted fibers than for WTnC or BCTnC substituted fibers. Also, the steepness of force activation was much less in VG1 and VG2 versus WTnC and BCTnC substituted fibers. These results suggest cooperative interactions between sites I and II in WTnC. In contrast, BCTnC has essentially the same apparent Ca2+ affinity and steepness of force activation as does WTnC. Thus, cardiac TnC must have structural differences from WTnC which compensate for the lack of site I, while in WTnC, both Ca2(+)-specific sites are probably crucial for full functional activity."
https://openalex.org/W1508136468,"When the FLP recombination target (FRT) is cut in half so that only one FLP protein-binding site is present, FLP protein forms a complex in which two such sites are linked head to head. Although held together exclusively by noncovalent interactions, this complex survives electrophoresis in an agarose gel and exhibits a half-life that can be measured in hours. Characterization of this complex indicates that a very stable, asymmetric dimeric complex of FLP protein monomers bound to the FRT is a likely early intermediate in FLP-mediated site-specific recombination. The apparent asymmetry is a property of the protein components of the complex. Even though the DNA components form a perfect palindrome, only one of the two possible DNA cleavage steps takes place in the course of complex formation. Formation of this complex does not occur with half-FRT site DNA substrates that preclude head to head monomer contact or when a FLP mutant protein is used that binds the FRT site but cannot cleave it. Trimeric and tetrameric complexes are also observed, the latter at very low frequency.

We found that 40-50% of the alpha-bungarotoxin-binding sites in detergent extracts of these cells corresponds to this unassembled alpha subunit. These unassembled alpha subunits are not found in the surface membrane. The unassembled alpha subunits in extracts from TE671 cells appear, like mature receptors, to have a disulfide bond between Cys-192 and Cys-193 near the acetylcholine-binding site. The unassembled alpha subunit binds alpha-bungarotoxin with high affinity, but its dissociation constant is still 5-fold higher than the native assembled acetylcholine receptor. The cholinergic ligands d-tubocurarine and carbamylcholine have negligible affinity for the immature alpha subunit. Similarly, Xenopus oocytes injected with RNA transcripts for the TE671 alpha subunit express an alpha-bungarotoxin-binding component which is insensitive to carbamylcholine and has a sedimentation coefficient on sucrose gradients of 5.0 S. Oocytes injected with RNA for the Torpedo alpha subunit did not have alpha-bungarotoxin binding activity under similar conditions, suggesting a possible differential efficiency in the maturation of this alpha subunit. We examined the binding of monoclonal antibodies specific to the main immunogenic region and found that this epitope on the unassembled alpha subunit was formed, but was not in a fully mature conformation because although these antibodies bound, they bound with lower affinity than to native acetylcholine receptors. Antibodies in myasthenia gravis patient sera also bound to the unassembled alpha subunits, but with an average 14-fold lower titer."
https://openalex.org/W2032050530,"Time-resolved lattice spacing changes were measured (10-millisecond time resolution) by x-ray diffraction of synchrotron radiation in single intact muscle fibers of the frog Rana temporaria undergoing electrically stimulated tension development during application of stretches and releases. Ramp releases, which decreased fiber length at constant speed, caused a lattice expansion. After the ramp, increasing tension during recovery was accompanied by lattice compression. Ramp stretches caused a compression of the lattice. While the fiber was held at a constant length after the stretch, tension decreased and lattice spacing increased. These observations demonstrate the existence of a previously undetected radial component of the force generated by a cycling crossbridge. At sarcomere lengths of 2.05 to 2.2 micrometers, the radial force compresses the myofilament lattice. Hence, the myofilament lattice does not maintain a constant volume during changes in force."
https://openalex.org/W1561845853,"Coagulation factor Va is a cofactor which combines with the serine protease factor Xa on a phospholipid surface to form the prothrombinase complex. The phospholipid-binding domain of bovine factor Va has been reported to be located on the light chain of the molecule and more precisely on a fragment of Mr = 30,000 which is obtained after digestion of factor Va light chain by factor Xa. This proteolytic fragment is located in the NH2-terminal part of factor Va light chain (residues 1564-1765). In order to further characterize the lipid-binding domain of bovine factor Va, isolated bovine light chain was preincubated with synthetic phospholipid vesicles (75% phosphatidylcholine, 25% phosphatidylserine) and digested with trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase. Two peptide regions protected from proteolytic cleavage were identified and characterized from each proteolytic digestion. A comparison of the NH2-terminal sequence and amino acid composition of the two tryptic peptides with the deduced sequence of human factor V indicates a match with residues 1657-1791 of the light chain of human factor V for one peptide and residues 1546-1656 for the other peptide. When chymotrypsin or elastase were used for digestion, the NH2-terminal sequence of one peptide showed a match with residues 1667-1797 of the light chain, while the other peptide presented an NH2-terminal sequence identical with the previously described for the bovine factor Va light chain. When these peptides were assayed for direct binding to phospholipid vesicles, only the tryptic and the chymotryptic peptides covering the middle region of the A3 domain of the bovine factor Va light chain demonstrated an ability to interact with phospholipid vesicles. Thus, knowing that the factor Xa cleavage site on the factor Va light chain is located between residues 1765 and 1766 of the light chain this lipid-binding region of the bovine factor Va is further localized to amino acid residues 1667-1765."
https://openalex.org/W1595624904,"A gene coding for bovine pancreatic DNase I has been constructed from synthetic oligonucleotides. This gene has been cloned into a plasmid vector pDOC55 designed to allow very tight control of expression of potentially lethal proteins. Induction of protein synthesis from the gene yielded a peptide of molecular weight of approximately 31,000, consistent with DNase I. The yield of this protein from the pDOC55 construct (pAW5) was approximately 150 micrograms/liter of cell culture. Attempts to clone the gene into a less tightly controlled expression vector based on the tac-promoter (pKK223-3) were unsuccessful, presumably due to the expected lethality of the product. Mutagenesis of the gene to replace the active site histidine (His-134) in the protein with glutamine yielded a gene readily clonable into both expression systems. Yields of the mutagenized protein were approximately 6 micrograms/liter from a pDOC55 system and 20 mg/liter from a pKK223-3 system. The activity of the proteins were assayed using the Kunitz procedure and their cleavage selectivities by digestion of the Escherichia coli tyr T promoter. The recombinant native enzyme had both the same specific activity and DNA cleavage selectivity as the protein isolated from bovine pancreas using these two assays. The H134Q mutant had a specific activity of about 0.001% of the native protein but had an unaltered DNA cleavage selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W1558519049,"The earliest replicating portion of the Chinese hamster dihydrofolate reductase domain contains a cluster of simple repeated sequences 180 base pairs long composed of 5'-(GC)5(AC)18(AG)21(G)9(CAGA)4GAGGGAGAGAGGCAGAGAGGG(AG)27-3 '. Previous nuclease sensitivity and intermolecular hybridization studies suggested that the two long (AG) repeats in this tract formed intramolecular DNA triplexes in negatively supercoiled plasmids at pH 5.2 (Caddle, M. S., Lussier, R. L., and Heintz, N. H. (1990) J. Mol. Biol. 211, 19-33). To further characterize the structural organization, supercoiled plasmids containing this region were analyzed in vitro with OsO4 and diethyl pyrocarbonate probes as well as with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis under different conditions. In pMCG, which contains the sequence in a 1.6-kilobase pair insert, the preferred conformation at neutral pH and at the native superhelical density is a Z-DNA structure for the (GC)5(AC)18 tract. Under mildly acidic conditions and at the native superhelical density, both (AG) tracts form intramolecular triplexes to the exclusion of the Z-DNA structure. Chemical probing of topoisomers of pMCG indicates that the (AG)27 tract forms a triplex more readily than the (AG)21 motif. Also, analysis of the reactivity obtained on a larger plasmid, pMCD, which contains the cluster of repeated sequences in a 4.75-kilobase pair insert, shows that at the native superhelical density the formation of intramolecular triplexes is limited to the (AG)27 tract. Finally, experiments conducted on different populations of topoisomers of pMCG show the existence, at pH 5.0 and highly negative superhelical density (greater than or equal to 0.080), of both the left-handed and the two triple-stranded structures in the same DNA. Therefore, one triplex is located immediately adjacent to the Z helix. Companion studies revealed that this region of the DHFR replicon modulates fork translocation during the replication of recombinant plasmids in mammalian cells."
https://openalex.org/W2028415294,"A molecular clone of the Xenopus laevis ets-2 gene was isolated from an oocyte complementary DNA library. The amount of messenger RNA (mRNA) in each oocyte or embryo was almost constant during oogenesis and was maintained until the blastula stage of embryonic development, indicating that the observed 3.2-kilobase transcript is a maternal message. The only normal adult tissue in which ets-2 mRNA was detected was the ovary. Injection of antisense oligonucleotides homologous to the ets-2 sequence into oocytes led to degradation of the mRNA and blocked hormone-induced germinal vesicle breakdown. The ets-2 product is thus required for the meiotic maturation of Xenopus oocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1640140582,"Human osteosarcoma cells express a 78-kDa proteoglycan core protein to which an asparagine-bound oligosaccharide, O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides and probably only a single chondroitin 6-sulfate chain of 29-kDa are bound. Prior to O-glycosylation, the N-glycosylated core protein exhibits a mass of 83 kDa. Upon digestion of the secreted proteoglycan with chondroitin ABC lyase a mature core protein with an apparent molecular mass of 106 kDa is obtained. Smaller amounts of core proteins of 101 and 115 kDa can be detected occasionally. The glycosaminoglycan composition and the relative molecular mass of the glycosaminoglycan chain distinguish this proteoglycan, tentatively named proteoglycan 100 (PG-100), from biglycan (small proteoglycan I) and decorin (small proteoglycan II) which are also expressed by osteosarcoma cells. An antiserum against PG-100 shows partial cross-reactivity with decorin, but in contrast to the latter proteoglycan it does not bind to type I collagen fibrils. PG-100 is not a unique product of osteosarcoma cells. It has also been found in the secretions of human skin fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1578665093,"The leech (Macrobdella decora) was found to contain two sialic acid-cleaving enzymes: an ordinary sialidase and a novel sialic acid-cleaving enzyme. This novel enzyme released 2,7-anhydro-alpha-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu2,7-anhydro5Ac) instead of alpha-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) from 4-methylumbelliferyl-Neu5Ac, glycoproteins, and gangliosides. We have partially purified this novel sialidase from M. decora. We have also isolated Neu2,7-anhydro5Ac released from 4-methylumelliferyl-Neu5Ac and whale nasal keratan sulfate in pure form. The novel sialidase produced Neu2,7-anhydro5Ac only from sialoglycoconjugates, but not from free Neu5Ac. The structure of Neu2,7-anhydro5Ac produced by the novel sialidase was established by chemical analysis, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy. NMR analysis showed that instead of the original 2C5 conformation, the pyranose ring of Neu2,7-anhydro5Ac was in the 5C2 conformation, which makes the formation of the 2,7-anhydro bridge possible."

The purification was greater than 700-fold with a 72% recovery, and the purified enzyme appeared as a single protein on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, immunoelectrophoresis, reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, and amino acid sequence analysis. The molecular weight was 66,000. The plasma JH esterase in wild-type, black, and white strains of M. sexta was similar when analyzed by immunotitration, wide range (pH 3.5-9.0) isoelectric focusing, and inhibition with MBTFP and 3-octylthio-1,1,1-trifluoropropan-2-one (OTFP). Inhibition studies revealed a sensitive and insensitive form (I50 = 10(-9) and 10(-6) M, respectively) in these three biotypes. Narrow range isoelectric focusing (pH 4.0-7.0) indicated the presence of two major isoelectric forms with pI values of 6.0 and 5.5, but their inhibition kinetics with OTFP and O,O-diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate were identical."
https://openalex.org/W1571160890,"The promoter region of human apoB -79 to -63 is recognized by a sequence-specific DNA binding protein, designated NF-BA1, which is essential for the transcriptional activation of the apoB gene in hepatic and intestinal cells. This protein has been purified to apparent homogeneity from rat liver nuclear extracts. The purification steps involve Q-Sepharose, Bio-Rex 70, S-Sepharose, and DNA-specific affinity chromatography. The purified protein was identified as a polypeptide of 60 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and photoaffinity cross-linking. In vitro transcription complementation experiments using normal and mutated -268 to +8 apoB promoter sequences as templates indicated that the purified protein retained the ability to stimulate apoB transcription when added to hepatic nuclear extracts. The stimulation of transcription is associated with the binding of the factor to its recognition sequence. A synthetic promoter consisting of five contiguous -79 to -63 elements in front of the core apoB promoter region -38 to +8 is strongly activated by NF-BA1 protein in hepatic extracts in vitro. Footprinting analysis showed that purified NF-BA1 binds to the regulatory regions of apoCIII (-87 to -63), apoAII (-740 to -719), and apoAI (-212 to -191) genes and may be involved in the regulation of their expression."
https://openalex.org/W1561248606,"The effects of acute and chronic treatment with ethanol on transport of reducing equivalents into mitochondria via the malate-aspartate shuttle were studied in perfused rat liver. The shuttle capacity was estimated from the decrease in rates of glucose production from the reduced substrate sorbitol caused by an increase in the NADH/NAD+ ratio in the cytosol due to metabolism of ethanol. The greater the capacity of the malate-aspartate shuttle, the smaller the inhibition of glucose synthesis by ethanol. Glucose synthesis was decreased about 2-fold less in livers from fasted rats treated acutely 2.5 h earlier with ethanol than in untreated controls. Chronic treatment with ethanol for 3-5 weeks prevented completely the decrease in glucose synthesis from sorbitol due to ethanol oxidation. Rates of ethanol uptake were elevated significantly from 69 +/- 7 mumols/g/h in livers from control rats up to 92 +/- 7 mumols/g/h in livers from SIAM rats. Similarly, rates of ethanol uptake were stimulated by chronic ethanol treatment from 71 +/- 6 to 222 +/- 15 mumols/g/h; this increase was largely sensitive to aminooxyacetate. Taken together, these data indicate that flux of reducing equivalents over the malate-aspartate shuttle is increased by both acute and chronic treatment with ethanol and that movement of reducing equivalents from the cytosol into the mitochondria via the malate-aspartate shuttle is an important rate determinant in hepatic ethanol oxidation."
https://openalex.org/W1591571853,"Bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP) is synthesized from exogenous phosphatidylglycerol (PG) by macrophages (Cochran, F. R., Roddick, V. L., Connor, J. R., Thornburg, J. T., and Waite, M. (1987) J. Immunol. 138, 1877-1883). Previous work from our laboratory showed that arachidonic acid in BMP was released by the macrophages upon challenge of the cells with PMA (Cochran, F. R., Connor, J. R., Roddick, V. L., and Waite, M. (1985) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 130, 800-806). Here we extend those studies using a model cultured cell line of macrophages, RAW 264.7. When PG labeled with 32P- and [3H]glycerol in both moieties was added to the culture medium, 32P/[3H]BMP was synthesized in a time-dependent manner. Fractionation of cell homogenates on a discontinuous sucrose gradient in which the light membranes were floated from dense sucrose showed an enrichment of [3H]BMP in light membrane fractions. The precursor [3H]PG was also found in the light fractions but, relative to the [3H]BMP, was more abundant in the denser membrane fractions. The appearance of [3H]PG and [3H]BMP in the light membrane fraction was time-dependent which suggested that the initial uptake and metabolism of [3H]PG was into the denser membranes. Incubation of the light membranes under conditions that are optimal for the lysosomal phospholipase A1 led to significant metabolism of [3H]PG. Both degradation of [3H]PG to water-soluble compounds and its conversion to acylphosphatidylglycerol occurred while no lyso-PG was detected. On the other hand, little BMP was found to be degraded. From these studies we postulate that in lysosomes acylphosphatidylglycerol is a precursor of BMP and that the previously reported turnover of arachidonic acid by BMP may occur via transacylation rather than hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1522634625,"Anaerobically grown Escherichia coli accumulate active manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) upon exposure to diamide. This induction requires de novo biosynthesis of MnSOD. Catalase, glutathione disulfide reductase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were also induced by diamide in anaerobic E. coli. A GSH-negative strain of E. coli did not produce MnSOD under anaerobic conditions and was as responsive to diamide as was the wild type strain. Diamide which had been prereduced, by incubation with GSH, was ineffective. NO3- plus paraquat, which elicits increased anaerobic biosynthesis of the MnSOD polypeptide, but not of active MnSOD, synergized with diamide in the induction of active MnSOD. A similar increase in the ability of diamide to cause anaerobic biosynthesis of active MnSOD was seen when the production of the MnSOD polypeptide was increased by isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, in a strain bearing the MnSOD gene under the control of the tac promoter. These results are explained in terms of a dual action of diamide, i.e. at both the transcriptional and the maturational levels of biosynthesis of MnSOD. Oxidative inactivation of an Fe(II)-containing repressor and oxidative facilitation of insertion of manganese, in place of iron, into the nascent MnSOD polypeptide, are the postulated bases of this dual action."
https://openalex.org/W1596173623,"Two pathways are possible during the proteolytic formation of alpha-thrombin (alpha-IIa) from prothrombin (II) or prethrombin 1 (P1). One of the pathways, with prethrombin 2 or prethrombin 2 associated with fragment 2 (P2F2) as intermediates, has long been known to exist when activation is catalyzed by Factor Xa (Xa) alone. The second pathway, with meizothrombin or meizothrombin (des fragment 1) (MzIIa(-F1)) as intermediate, has been shown to exist when Factor Va and phospholipids are present with Xa. Until now, MzIIa(-F1) has not been detected in reactions catalyzed by Xa alone. In this study, we demonstrate that P1 activation by Xa alone occurs via both pathways, and we provide rate constants and kinetic equations for calculating the relative contributions of each of the pathways to the formation of alpha-IIa by Xa. Investigation of the initial rates of proteolytic cleavage of P2F2 and P1 by Xa alone indicated first-order dependence on substrate concentration with no evidence of saturation of Xa with either substrate at concentrations as high as 200 microM. Apparent second-order rate constants (kc/Km) of 113 +/- 9 M-1 s-1 for the formation of thrombin from P2F2 and 1,410 +/- 19 M-1 s-1 for the disappearance of P1 were determined at pH 7.5, 25 degrees C, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.15 M ionic strength. A two-step sequential first-order pathway employing these rate constants for thrombin activity production from P1 via P2F2 could not, however, account for the quantity of thrombin that was produced during the early stages of P1 activation. Addition of a parallel first-order reaction to produce thrombin activity from P1 independently of P2F2, tentatively identified as the formation of MzIIa(-F1), yielded progress curves in quantitative agreement with the experimental data. kc/Km for the parallel reaction was estimated to be 98 +/- 10 M-1 s-1. Independent determination of the second-order rate constant for the cleavage of isolated MzIIa (-F1), 15,000 +/- 420 M-1 s-1, indicated that MzIIa(-F1) could meet the kinetic requirements for an intermediate in the parallel activation pathway. The transient formation of MzIIa (-F1), as well as the generation of alpha-IIa, was directly demonstrated during activation of P1 by active site-affinity labeling of the reaction products with a biotin derivative of D-Phe-Pro-Arg chloromethyl ketone and visualization by semiquantitative Western blotting.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1516951203,"We have used site-directed mutagenesis to obtain human pro alpha 2(I) cDNAs containing novel mutations designed to inhibit cleavage at the C-proteinase site. Deletion of six relatively conserved amino acids which surround the cleavage site did not interfere with assembly of the triple helix in transfected rat cells, but blocked cleavage of the constituent mutated chains by endogenous C-proteinase. Substitution for a conserved Asp, which forms part of the Ala-Asp bond cleaved by C-proteinase, also blocked cleavage by endogenous C-proteinase. The conserved Asp is, therefore, a necessary component of the C-proteinase cleavage site. Incubation in vitro with a purified mouse C-proteinase, confirmed both mutations to be resistant to cleavage by high concentrations of the physiologically relevant enzyme. Mutant pro alpha 2(I) chains, resistant to cleavage by C-proteinase in culture media, were processed in cell layers by a different protease which cleaved telopeptide domains. Naturally occurring mutations at the C-proteinase site have not been described in human patients. The mutations characterized here, further define the C-proteinase cleavage site and provide reagents which may be informative when introduced into transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W1516984392,"The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) was immunoprecipitated from [35S]methionine-labeled skin fibroblasts derivatized at 4 or 18 degrees C with an impermeant biotinylating reagent. Separation of derivatized and underivatized receptor from immunoprecipitates by selective binding to streptavidin-agarose allowed assessment of receptor protein cellular compartmentation and rates of intercompartmental transfer. At both 4 and 18 degrees C the amount of LDLR that is derivatized in cells labeled to near steady state saturates after 1-2 h of reaction at, respectively, 47 and 70% of total immunoprecipitable receptor protein. On the basis of temperature titration experiments, protein exposed only to the cell surface reacts at 4 degrees C; raising the temperature of biotinylation to 18 degrees C provides access to an additional pool of receptor protein. Remaining LDLR is derivatized at 37 degrees C. LDLR unreactive at 18 degrees C largely resides in membrane compartment(s) devoid of plasma membrane on the basis of its fractionation on Percoll gradients. While total cellular LDLR and 4 degrees C-derivatized LDLR labeled to steady state turn over in a first order manner (t1/2 = 12-13 h), the specific activity of pulse-labeled, 4 degrees C-accessible protein peaks after 1-2 h of chase and reaches a reduced level by 3 h of chase. These latter results show that the newly synthesized LDLR is transiently enriched at the cell surface prior to achieving equilibrium distribution between the cell surface and intracellular pools."
https://openalex.org/W1502719410,"Abstract In Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast, a cycloheximide-sensitive step (Ki = 0.12 +/- 0.05 microM) is passaged greater than or equal to 4 to less than or equal to 13 minutes prior to the alpha-factor-sensitive step in the cell cycle of normal proliferating cells and in the first and second bud emergence cycles of abnormally large cells that had been arrested for cell division with alpha-factor and allowed to recover. This identifies the chronologically last protein synthetic step of the cell cycle that occurs prior to the completion of Start. This step is named the last synthetic prestart or LSP step. Cells require the completion of the LSP step before they can perform Start during recovery from arrest by alpha-factor. Yet alpha-factor is known to prevent cell division by acting at Start. The combined data suggest that alpha-factor prevents the Start step of cell division by inactivating a protein that is 1) required for the performance of Start, and 2) synthesized shortly prior to Start in the last synthetic prestart step."
https://openalex.org/W1540107478,"Abstract The intracellular hemoglobin of the polychaete Glycera dibranchiata consists of several components, some of which self-associate into a fraction. The cDNA library constructed from the poly(A+) mRNA of Glycera erythrocytes (Simons, P. C., and Satterlee, J. D. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 8525-8530) was screened with two oligodeoxynucleotide probes corresponding to the amino acid sequences MEEKVP and AMNSKV. Each of the two probes identified a full-length positive insert; these were sequenced using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. One clone was 630 bases long and contained 36 bases of 5'-untranslated RNA, a reading frame of 441 bases coding for the 147 amino acids of globin P2 including the residues MEEKVP, and a 3'-untranslated region of 153 bases. The other clone was 540 bases long and contained 24 bases of 5'-untranslated RNA, an open reading frame of 441 bases coding for globin P3 including the residues AMNSKV, and a 3'-untranslated region of 75 bases. The inferred amino acid sequences of the two globins were in agreement with the partial amino acid sequences obtained by chemical methods. The P2 and P3 globin sequences, together with the previously determined P1 sequence of a complete insert and partial sequences P4, P5, and P6 obtained from partial inserts (Zafar, R. S., Chow, L. H., Stern, M. S., Vinogradov, S. N., and Walz, D. A. (1990) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, in press) suggest that there are at least six components in the polymeric fraction of Glycera hemoglobin, which is in agreement with the results of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in Tris/glycine buffer, pH 8.3, 6 M urea. Nothern and dot blot analyses of Glycera erythrocyte poly(A+) mRNA using the foregoing two cDNA probes clearly demonstrated the presence of mature messages encoding both types of globins. Comparison of the polymeric sequences P1, P2, and P3 with the globins M-II and M-IV using the alignment and templates of Bashford et al. (Bashford, D., Chothia, C., and Lesk, A. M. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 196, 199-216) showed that all five globins have identical residues at 39 positions. At 44 positions, the three polymeric globins share identical residues that differ from the identical residues at the corresponding locations in the monomeric sequences M-II and M-IV including position E7, where the latter have leucine instead of the distal histidine. At 15 positions, there occurs an alteration from polar to nonpolar or from a small nonpolar to a larger nonpolar residue in going from the monomeric to the polymeric globins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
