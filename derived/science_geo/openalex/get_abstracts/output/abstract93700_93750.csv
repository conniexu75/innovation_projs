Causally related to the spirochetes may be long-lasting cutaneous lesions that appeared on New Zealand White rabbits 10 to 12 weeks after infected ticks fed on them. Samples of serum from patients with Lyme disease were shown by indirect immunofluorescence to contain antibodies to this agent. It is suggested that the newly discovered spirochete is involved in the etiology of Lyme disease."

https://openalex.org/W1595467693,"Prostacyclin (PGI2) is a vasoactive prostaglandin synthesized by vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. In order to investigate whether plasma lipoproteins influence the biosynthesis and release of prostacyclin by vascular tissues, human high density lipoproteins (HDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) were incubated with porcine arterial endothelial cells grown in tissue culture. PGI2 production was measured by radioimmunoassay of its stable metabolite, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha. In incubations of HDL with endothelial cells for 24 h, levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha in the medium increased significantly in a dose-dependent fashion to values 5-fold above control. This effect was less pronounced in confluent than in subconfluent cultures and did not occur in the presence of an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase. No significant stimulation of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was observed when the endothelial cells were incubated with LDL. In time course experiments with HDL, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha levels increased continuously over 24 h. Rat HDL, containing a high content of arachidonate in its cholesterol ester fatty acids, caused a 2-4-fold greater release of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha than human HDL. The delipidated apoprotein of both human and rat HDL caused similar stimulation of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha production, but much less than intact HDL. The data indicate that HDL stimulates PGI2 synthesis by cultured arterial endothelial cells, possibly by providing the cells with arachidonate."

https://openalex.org/W1589699489,"The effect of myosin light chain phosphorylation on the association of myosin with the cytoskeletal structures of platelets was quantitated. In unstimulated platelets, little myosin light chain was phosphorylated and myosin remained in solution when cytoskeletons from Triton X-100 lysates of platelets were sedimented by centrifugation. In platelets activated by thrombin, the calcium ionophore A23187, or collagen, the rate and extent of myosin light chain phosphorylation paralleled the association of myosin with platelet cytoskeletal structures. Dephosphorylation of myosin light chain and myosin dissociation from the cytoskeleton occurred at comparable rates at longer times after addition of the stimulating agents to platelets. Quantitation of radioactive phosphate in the cytoskeleton-associated myosin and in the soluble myosin showed that the phosphorylated myosin light chain was selectively isolated with the Triton-insoluble cytoskeletons, whereas nonphosphorylated myosin was not associated. Inhibition of the light chain kinase with the calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine inhibited myosin light chain phosphorylation and incorporation of myosin into the platelet cytoskeletons. Inhibition of light chain phosphorylation by prostaglandin E1 and prostacyclin produced similar effects. Thus, phosphorylation of the myosin light chain stabilizes the association of myosin with the contractile structures within platelets."

The antibodies to insulin receptor displaced labeled insulin from insulin receptors and mimicked the actions of insulin in stimulating the oxidation of glucose and its incorporation into lipids, and in inhibiting lipolysis. The antibodies to insulin receptor could be blocked by or bound to the antibodies to insulin, and therefore were identified as anti-idiotypes. Thus, immunization against a hormone may activate spontaneously an idiotype-anti-idiotype network resulting in antibodies to the hormone receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1570060003,"Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, maintained in the presence of insulin, exhibit up-regulation of insulin-binding capacity when insulin is removed from the culture medium. Both cell surface and total cellular insulin receptors increase by 1.8- to 2.0-fold during the 24-h period following the removal of insulin. When up-regulated 3T3-L1 cells are exposed to 10(-8) M insulin down-regulation of insulin receptors occurs with a t1/2 of 2-3 h. Down-regulation was complete after a 10-h exposure to insulin and resulted in a 50-60% decrease in levels of cell surface and total cellular insulin-binding capacities, respectively. Scatchard analysis revealed that these changes in insulin binding are due to an alteration of receptor number and not insulin-binding affinity. To clarify the mechanism(s) by which the regulation of insulin receptor level occurs, rates of receptor synthesis and degradation were determined by the heavy isotope density-shift method. No change in the rate of receptor synthesis occurred as a consequence of up-regulation or down-regulation. Up-regulation, however, caused an increase in receptor half-life from 8.1 h in the control cells to 14.8 h. Subsequent down-regulation brought about a return of receptor half-life to 6.9 h. These results indicate that insulin-dependent regulation of insulin receptor level in 3T3-L1 adipocytes involves a change in the rate of receptor degradation. Further studies indicated that regulation of insulin receptor level has physiological significance, since up-regulated cells exhibit an increased responsiveness of 2-deoxyglucose uptake to insulin compared to down-regulated cells."
https://openalex.org/W1568609048,"The native insulin receptor affinity-labeled by covalent cross-linking to 125I-insulin has been proposed to consist of two alpha receptor subunits and two beta-receptor subunits all disulfide-linked as a Mr = 350,000 (beta-S-S-alpha)-S-S-(alpha-S-S-beta) receptor complex (Massague, J., Pilch, P. F., and Czech, M. P. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 3181-3190). We denote the disulfide bonds linking the two symmetrical (alpha-S-S-beta) receptor halves as class I insulin receptor disulfides, whereas the disulfide bonds linking one alpha receptor subunit to one beta receptor subunit are termed class II disulfides. In the present studies, dithiothreitol added directly to intact rat fat cells or to membranes prepared from rat fat cell, rat liver, or human placenta, reduced the class I disulfides, but not the class II disulfides, of the insulin receptor. Reduction of class I insulin receptor disulfides did not prevent binding of insulin to the insulin receptor. After treatment with dithiothreitol, the number of apparent high affinity insulin binding sites was increased in rat fat cells or fat cell membranes but was decreased in rat liver and human placenta membranes. Reduction of class I insulin receptor disulfides did not alter the sensitivity to insulin of glucose oxidation in intact rat fat cells. The resistance of class II disulfides to reduction by dithiothreitol was not affected by solubilization of the membrane structure by Triton X-100. Class II insulin receptor disulfides were fully reduced by dithiothreitol only after denaturation of the insulin receptor by sodium dodecyl sulfate. Class I insulin receptor disulfides were partially reoxidized by an incubation mixture consisting of reduced and oxidized glutathione. When solubilized insulin receptor containing reduced class I disulfides was exposed to ethylene glycol bis(succinimidyl succinate), the receptor subunits were internally cross-linked and migrated like intact receptor complexes on nonreduced dodecyl sulfate gels. We conclude that the (alpha-S-S-beta) receptor halves in the partially reduced receptor remain associated by noncovalent interactions and that this receptor structure without class I disulfides remains biologically competent."

The preparative method consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation and three chromatography steps on DEAE-cellulose, Sephadex G-50, and CM-Sepharose. Calf thymus glutaredoxin was assayed on the basis of its inherent GSH-disulfide transhydrogenase activity. Glutaredoxin, purified 3000-fold was demonstrated to be homogeneous by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and high performance liquid chromatography. It behaved as a neutral or slightly basic molecule having a Mr of around 11,000. The apparent Km value of glutaredoxin with calf thymus ribonucleotide reductase at 4 mM GSH was 6.0 X 10(-7) M. With ribonucleotide reductase from Escherichia coli, calf thymus glutaredoxin had a Km value of 1.9 X 10(-6) M and a molecular activity that was only 10% of that achieved with the calf thymus enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1483011815,"On treatment of Escherichia coli cells with globomycin, a glyceride-containing precursor of the major outer membrane lipoprotein accumulates in the cytoplasmic membrane (Hussain, M., Ichihara, S., and Mizushima, S. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 3707-3712). When the envelope fraction from such cells was incubated in a suitable buffer, this precursor could be processed to the mature lipoprotein. The processing involved removal of the signal peptide and subsequent acylation of the NH2 terminus thus bared. Two types of peptidase and an acylation enzyme(s) were found to be involved in these processes. The enzyme that cleaves the signal peptide, called signal peptidase in this paper, had many unique properties: being highly resistant to high temperature, having a wide optimum pH range, and being highly sensitive to detergents. The other peptidase(s), called signal peptide peptidase in this paper, was assumed to be responsible for the digestion of the signal peptide that had been cleaved from the precursor lipoprotein. This enzyme was rather heat-sensitive. Thus the processing from the precursor to the mature lipoprotein at a high temperature resulted in accumulation of a peptide that was most probably the intact signal peptide. The third enzyme(s) involved in the processing was the one that is responsible for acylation of the newly bared NH2 terminus of the lipoprotein. The enzyme activity was also lost at 80 degrees C. In the light of these findings, the biosynthetic pathway of the lipoprotein is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1989943265,"The mating-type a and α alleles of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae interconvert by a transposition-substitution reaction where replicas of the silent mating loci, at HML and HMR, are transmitted to the expressed mating-type locus (MAT). HML is on the left arm and HMR on the right arm, while MAT is in the middle of chromosome III. Cells with the genotype HMLα HMRa switch mating type efficiently at a frequency of about 86%. Since well over 50% of the cells switch, it is thought that switches do not occur randomly, but are directed to occur to the opposite mating-type allele. In contrast, we report that strains possessing the reverse HMLa HMRα arrangement switch (phenotype) inefficiently at a maximum of about 6%. The basis for this apparent reduced frequency of switching is that these strains preferentially yield futile homologous MAT locus switches—that is, MATa to MATa and MATα to MATα—and consequently, most of these events are undetected. We used genetically marked HM loci to demonstrate that a cells preferentially choose HMR as donor and a cells preferentially choose HML as donor, irrespective of the genetic content of the silent loci. Because of this feature, HMLα HMRa strains generate predominantly heterologous while HMLa HMRα strains produce predominantly homologous MAT switches. The control for directionality of switching therefore is not at the level of transposing heterologous mating-type information, but only at the level of choosing HML versus HMR as the donor. In strains where the preferred donor locus is deleted, the Inefficient donor becomes capable of donating efficiently. Thus the preference seems to be mediated by competition between the HM loci for donating information to MAT."
https://openalex.org/W1566316155,"The major coat protein of bacteriophage M13 spans the plasma membrane of infected cells prior to its assembly into extruding virus. It is initially made as a precursor, termed procoat, with a 23-residue leader sequence at its NH2 terminus. Procoat is found bound to the inner surface of the plasma membrane. The electrical potential of the cell membrane is required for procoat insertion and conversion to coat protein, although the order of these events has been unknown. We now report studies of the conversion of a mutant procoat (procoat-R6) from the virus M13am8H1R6 to mutant coat (coat R6). The behavior of procoat-R6 differs from that of the wild type procoat in three respects. (i) Pulse-labeled procoat-R6 is largely found inserted across the cell membrane. This suggests that the active site of leader peptidase is on the periplasmic membrane face and that insertion normally precedes processing for wild type procoat as well. (ii) Despite the greater abundance of inserted procoat-R6 in M13am8H1R6-infected cells than inserted procoat in wild type infections, procoat-R6 is processed to coat-R6 more slowly than procoat is converted to coat. (iii) The membrane insertion and proteolytic processing of procoat-R6 are almost completely insensitive to uncouplers. We present a working model for the energetics and assembly intermediates of coat protein biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1498321805,"The serine proteases human leukocyte (HL) elastase, porcine pancreatic elastase, cathepsin G, and bovine chymotrypsin A alpha are inhibited competitively at pH 7.5 by heterocyclic compounds such as 2-substituted 4H-3,1-benzoxazin-4-ones, 4-quinazolines, and 4-chloroquinazolines, N-substituted phthalimides, and by thioesters of N-acylanthranilic acids. The most potent inhibitors have KI values in the 10(-7)--10(-8) M range. The inhibitors with fluoroalkyl or fluoroacyl substituents are much more potent than the alkyl or acyl derivatives. The quinazolinones, chloroquinazolines, and N-substituted phthalimides are quite specific for HL elastase. With HL elastase, an excellent correlation is observed between pKI and the infrared carbonyl-stretching frequency of the inhibitor. It is proposed that the partially polarized carbonyl group of the inhibitor interacts with a partially polarized charge relay system of the serine protease. The substituents on the inhibitors are proposed to interact with the primary substrate binding site of the serine proteases. The results indicate that it is possible to develop non-peptide small molecules which are specific inhibitors for HL elastase."

https://openalex.org/W1549965835,"We obtained two fragments of colicin E1 by limited proteolysis with thermolysin. Both of the fragments have an ionophore-like activity. One of the fragments, Th1 (Mr = 18,000), induces an increase in membrane ion permeability comparable with that with whole colicin E1 when assayed with liposomes prepared from soybean phospholipids. This suggests that Th1 is an active fragment of colicin E1. The size of this fragment is about one-third of that of colicin E1 and it was found that the fragment is derived from the COOH-terminal part of colicin E1. A larger fragment, Th2 (Mr = 39,000), was also obtained on thermolysin treatment of colicin E1, which comprises the two-thirds of colicin E1 from the COOH terminus and has a receptor-binding activity in addition to the same ionophore-like activity of Th1. Th2 has the ability to kill osmotic shocked cells but not intact cells, suggesting that the NH2-terminal portion of colicin E1, which was lost in Th2, is responsible for the transport of the colicin molecule through the outer membrane. Thus, the regions which possess or correlate to the ionophore-like, receptor-binding, and transmembrane activities of colicin E1 were assigned to the COOH-terminal, central, and NH2-terminal parts of the molecule, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1541005821,"The DNA sequence of the apocytochrome b gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae D273-10B contains two intervening sequences (Nobrega, F. G., and Tzagoloff, A. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 9828-9837). The exon-intron boundaries of the gene have been determined in this study from the sequence of the DNA which was copied from the mRNA. A protein of 385 amino acid residues is predicted from the 1155-nucleotide long coding regions. Northern blot analysis of total mitochondrial RNA, probed with restriction fragments from both exon and intron regions of the gene, reveals a 4.3-kilobase (kb) transcript containing both introns and two partially spliced intermediates, one (2.9 kb) lacking the first intron and the other (3.6 kb) lacking the second intron. The most abundant transcript (2.1 kb) hybridizes only to exon probes and is presumed to the fully spliced mRNA. S1 nuclease mapping of the purified mRNA indicates existence of two separate RNAs with identical 3' termini but differing by approximately 217 nucleotides at their 5' ends. The larger transcript has a 950-nucleotide nontranslated leader. Analyses of the RNA species present in various rho- and mit- mutants indicate that: 1) exon mutants process both introns, albeit not as efficiently as wild type, 2) intron mutants blocked in the excision of the first or second intron are capable of processing the alternate intron, suggesting a non-obligatory order of excision of the two intervening sequences, and 3) excision of the second intron occurs in rho- mutants and therefore does not require a mitochondrial translation product."
https://openalex.org/W1553669153,"This paper further characterizes a protein we have demonstrated in Candida albicans which has the ability to bind corticosterone and related steroid hormones. Fungal cells are disrupted and cytosol is incubated with [3H]corticosterone for 3 h at which time peak steady state binding is achieved. Bound hormone is separated from free using Sephadex G-50 minicolumns or dextran-coated charcoal. Binding was found to be a linear function of protein concentration. The bound hormone co-migrates with authentic corticosterone in thin layer chromatographic systems indicating no metabolism of the radioprobe. Scatchard analysis of the binding in the pseudohyphal form of C. albicans yielded values of 6.3 nM for the Kd and a binding capacity of about 650 fmol/mg of cytosol protein; both determinations are comparable to our findings in the yeast form of this organism. A series of sterols were tested for their ability to displace [3H]corticosterone from the yeast binder, and the results show that the binder is remarkably selective and stereo specific. Physical-chemical studies show the binder to be degraded at high temperatures and that binding is destroyed by trypsin and sulfhydryl blockers. The protein sediments at 4 S on sucrose gradients and does not exhibit ionic dependent aggregation. The molecular weight is estimated to be approximately 43,000 daltons by gel chromatography. We hypothesize that this intracellular protein may represent a primitive form of either the mammalian glucocorticoid receptor or the plasma corticosteroid-binding globulin."

https://openalex.org/W1576766639,"Change in the level of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation during the cell cycle of HeLa S3 cells was examined in three different in vitro systems: isolated nuclei, chromatin, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase extracted from isolated nuclei, and by the direct immunofluorescent antibody technique in situ. In isolated nuclei, after release from thymidine-hydroxyurea double block, the level of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation was low in the S phase and increased in the late G2 phase with a peak in the M phase. In chromatin, the level began to increase in the mid-late S phase, was maintained at a high level throughout the G2 phase, decreased in the M phase, and became basal during the G1 phase. The activity of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase extracted from isolated nuclei was relatively high throughout the cell cycle and was highest in the G2 phase. Similar changes during the HeLa S3 cell cycle were observed in the three systems after release from Colcemid block. In synchronously growing HeLa S3 cells in situ, nuclei in the G2-M phase were stained strongest for poly(ADP-ribose) by the immunofluorescent staining. These results were consistent with the peak of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in the G2-M phase observed in the nuclear system in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1585403533,"S-Acylated derivatives of the acyl carrier protein (ACP) of Escherichia coli were prepared by a specific chemical reaction. The properties of acetyl-ACP, butyryl-ACP, and hexanoyl-ACP were compared with those of long chain (greater than C8) acyl-ACPs. Acylation of ACP with long chain (greater than or equal to C8) acyl groups stabilizes the protein to alkaline pH-induced hydrodynamic expansion, the degree of stabilization being independent of acyl chain length (Rock, C. O., and Cronan, J. E., Jr. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 9778-9785). This was not true of the short chain length acyl-ACPs. We report that the C2, C4, and C6 acyl-ACPs showed a lower degree of stabilization (greater hydrodynamic radii) under alkaline conditions than the longer chain lengths. The degree of stabilization (assayed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 9.5) was a direct function of acyl chain length (C8 greater than C6 greater than C4 greater than C2 greater than ACP). Long chain (greater than C10) acyl-ACPs bind tightly to octyl-Sepharose whereas ACP does not bind. The strength of binding is a direct function of acyl chain length for C10 to C16 (Rock, C. O., and Garwin, J. L. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 7123-7128). In contrast to the result expected if the entire acyl chain was accessible, we report that neither acetyl-ACP nor butyryl-ACP binds to octyl-Sepharose. Moreover, both hexanoyl-ACP and octanoyl-ACP bind less tightly to octyl-Sepharose than expected from extrapolation of the data for the longer chain length acyl-ACPs. Both the pH stabilization data and the hydrophobic chromatographic data are interpreted as indicating the presence of an acyl chain binding site on ACP that binds the first 6 to 8 carbon atoms of the acyl chain."
https://openalex.org/W1601736957,"2-Ketocaproate and 2-ketoisocaproate were equally potent insulin secretagogues. The insulin secretory potency of L-leucine was less than half of that of the keto acids and L-norleucine did not induce any insulin release by isolated islets and by the perfused pancreas from ob/ob mice. Rates of decarboxylation of 2-keto-[1-14C]isocaproate and of 2-keto-[1-14C]caproate were equally high. The finding is consistent with the view that enhanced production of reducing equivalents is necessary for initiation of insulin release. The rates of decarboxylation and transamination of L-[1-14C]leucine by isolated pancreatic islets were several times higher than the rates observed with L-[1-14C]norleucine. Thus, the high activity of the pancreatic islet branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase may be important for the recognition of L-leucine as an insulin secretagogue by pancreatic B-cells."

https://openalex.org/W1576771902,"Incubation of NADH at neutral and slightly alkaline pH leads to the gradual absorption of 1 mol of H+. This uptake of acid requires oxygen and mainly yields anomerized NAD+ (NAD+), with only minimal formation od acid-modified NADH. The overall stoichiometry of the reaction is: NADH + H+ + 1/2O2 leads to H2O + NAD+, with NADH peroxide (HO2-NADH+) serving as the intermediate that anomerizes and breaks down to give NAD+ and H2O2. The final reaction reaction mixture contains less than 0.1% of the generated H2O2, which is nonenzymically reduced by NADH. The latter reaction is inhibited by catalase, leading to a decrease in the overall rate of acid absorption, and stimulated by peroxidase, leading to an increase in the overall rate of acid absorption. Although oxygen can attack NADH at either N-1 or C-5 of the dihydropyridine ring, the attack appears to occur primarily at N-1. This assignment is based on the inability of the C-5 peroxide to anomerize, whereas the N-1 peroxide, being a quaternary pyridinium compound, can anomerize via reversible dissociation of H2O2. The peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of NADH by H2O2 does not lead to anomerization, indicating that anomerization occurs prior to the release of H2O2. Chromatography of reaction mixtures on Dowex 1 formate shows the presence of two major and several minor neutral and cationic degradation products. One of the major products is nicotinamide, which possibly arises from breakdown of nicotinamide-1-peroxide. The other products have not been identified, but may be derived from other isomeric nicotinamide peroxides."

https://openalex.org/W1485756237,"We have investigated the response of plasma renin activity (PRA), total, active, and inactive plasma renin concentration (PRC) to immobilization stress in rats. A great increase of PRA was already found after 5 min of immobilization. In contrast, total PRC was elevated only after 1 h of stress. During the initial 15 min, the increase of active PRC was quantitatively matched by the decrease of inactive PRC. This suggests that the initial very rapid response of the plasma renin-angiotensin system to immobilization stress is facilitated by the activation of inactive renin. To get more information about this in vivo activation process, we performed gel filtration of control, acid-treated control, and plasma from 15-min immobilized rats. In the control plasma, two peaks with renin-like activity corresponded to molecular weights of approximately 43,000 and 36,000. Acid-activatable renin was eluted at four molecular weights: 50,000, 58,000, 72,000, and 85,000. In acid-treated control plasma, the peak at 85,000 was decreased and the peak at 43,000 was increased. In plasma from 15-min immobilized rats, the inactive renin of Mr 50,000 was suppressed more than that of 85,000 while the level of active renin, Mr 43,000, was much higher than in controls. The results indicate that stress-induced in vivo activation of inactive renin does not proceed by the same mechanism as in vitro acid-activation."

https://openalex.org/W1548559216,"Modification of yeast ribosomes with dimethylmaleic anhydride, a reagent for protein amino groups, is accompanied by loss of polypeptide-synthesizing activity. This activity can be recovered by incubation at pH 6, which produces regeneration of the modified amino groups. Dimethylmaleic anhydride modification also causes the dissociation of proteins from the ribosomes. Protein-deficient ribosomal particles are prepared from 80 S ribosomes or 60 S subunits by treatment with a molar excess of reagent relative to ribosomal particles equal to 6300 or 4800, respectively. The core particles from 80 S ribosomes lack 18% and those from 60 S subunits 40% of the total protein in the corresponding untreated control. In both cases, there is a selective release of proteins, the protein-deficient particles being able to reconstitute active 60 S subunits upon addition of the corresponding split proteins. The reconstituted ribosomal particles, when assayed in the presence of native 40 S subunits, are active in poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis (30-90% of the activity of a dimethylmaleic anhydride-untreated control, as compared to 0-15% when the split proteins are excluded). This procedure could prove useful in the study of the structure and function of the eukaryotic ribosome."
https://openalex.org/W1538528036,"Contractile activity is followed by an increase in the permeability of muscle to sugar. The increase in sugar transport rate persists unchanged for hours before gradually returning to base-line (Holloszy, J. O., and Narahara, H. T. (1965) J. Biol. Chem. 240, 3493-3500). This prolonged delay suggested that the recovery process might involve protein synthesis. We have investigated this possibility. A large increase in permeability to [3-3H]methylglucose occurred in frog sartorius muscles stimulated to contract 60 times/min for 30 min. Cycloheximide or puromycin at concentrations that inhibited protein synthesis completely blocked reversal of the increase in permeability to 3-methylglucose. The recovery process was not irreversibly impaired, as permeability returned to base-line in muscles that were washed and incubated without protein synthesis inhibitors for a second 24-h period. Reversal of the increase in permeability to 3-methylglucose induced by a high concentration of epinephrine was also prevented by cycloheximide. In contrast, cycloheximide did not prevent reversal of the increases in sugar transport rate induced by either insulin or trypsin. These results provide evidence that exercise and catecholamines activate sugar transport by a process that requires protein synthesis for its reversal, while the increases in permeability induced by insulin and trypsin involve a different mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1595660345,"We describe crude in vitro systems from T4-infected cells which reflect in vivo T4 regulation. Lysates from cells which had been infected in the presence of chloramphenicol manifest the same polarity of RNA synthesis as did the infected cells. Next, we describe a complementation system between lysates which have no RNA synthetic capacity and purified RNA polymerase; in this system, delayed early RNA synthesis in vitro depends on the presence of an active mot gene product. Mot activity controls middle mode gene expression in vivo. In vitro, not activity in the lysate directs RNA polymerase to initiate on regions of DNA that are otherwise inaccessible. This mot-dependent delayed early RNA synthesis in vitro is seen at 0.1 and 0.2 M KCl, but not at 0.05 M KCl. We present a model in which mot is a DNA melting protein necessary for recognition of a middle promoters by either Escherichia coli or T4-modified RNA polymerase which contains E. coli sigma subunit."

https://openalex.org/W1556896921,"The cysteine-directed reagent N-ethylmaleimide rapidly and completely inactivates pyruvate oxidase. This inactivation is correlated with the reaction of one cysteine residue per enzyme monomer. In the presence of the cofactor, thiamin pyrophosphate, the enzyme is not inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide. Furthermore, the N-ethylmaleimide-inactivated enzyme exhibits a very low affinity for the cofactor as determined by a fluorescence quenching technique. The presence of a reactive cysteine residue at the thiamin pyrophosphate binding site is therefore indicated. Although N-ethylmaleimide completely inactivates the enzyme, a second sulfhydryl reagent methylmethanethiosulfonate is only partially inhibitory. It is shown that methylmethanethiosulfonate and N-ethylmaleimide react with the same cysteine residue. Thus, the N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive residue is probably not directly involved in catalysis."

https://openalex.org/W1492394249,"The effect of bisulfite-induced C to U transitions on the aminoacylation of highly purified Escherichia coli tRNAgly3,gcc has been studied. On treatment with 3.2 M NaHSO3 at 25 degrees C and pH 5.8, C to U transitions occurred at 4 of the 21 cytosine residues during the first 16 h. After about 12 h, 2 additional unidentified residues begin to react. From these data and theoretical consideration, we conclude: 1) E. coli tRNAgly3,gcc exists in the native conformation under the conditions of the reaction; 2) its ordered structure is similar to yeast tRNAPhe; 3) its anticodon loop is flexible in solution. During the reaction, loss of glycine acceptor activity followed first order kinetics with a t1/2 = 1.8 h. After modification for 1.25 h and aminoacylation (61% glycine acceptor activity remaining), the aminoacylated fraction was isolated. The fractional change at each of the reactive residues in the unfractionated mixture (f) and the aminoacylated fraction (p) was measured. The results were: C35, f = 0.33, p = 0.19; C36, f = 0.25, p = 0.10; C74, f = 0.28, p = 0.26; C75, f = 0.25, p = 0.20. From these data, the Modulation Constant for each reactive residue was calculated from the equation M = (f - p)/f(1 - p): M35 (anticodon) = 0.52; M36 (anticodon) = 0.67; M74 (CCA end) = 0.10; M75 (CCA end) = 0.25. These values, which are based on the assumptions that the C to U reactions occur independently and that the effect of each change on the acceptor activity is an independent event, express the fractional loss in activity that would occur from a C to U change at the residue in question by itself. From these results, we conclude: 1) approximately 80% of the observed inactivation was due to changes in the anticodon; 2) neither of these anticodon residues (C35 and C36) is essential for aminoacylation; 3) a C to U change at C75 (CCA end) has a small effect on aminoacylation; 4) a C to U change at C74 (CCA end) has little or no effect on aminoacylation."
https://openalex.org/W1637266332,"Profiles of 9 alpha, 11 alpha, 15(S)-trihydroxyprosta-5,13-dienoic acid (PGF2 alpha) and its catabolites in blood and urine of male adult Wistar rats were determined by high pressure liquid chromatography during and after slow intravenous infusion of tritium-labeled PGF2 alpha. In addition to PGF2 alpha and 15-keto-13,14-dihydro-PGF2 alpha, a major catabolite in blood during the infusion was identified as tetranor-15-keto-13,14-dihyro-PGF2 alpha (VII). This product was absent in the corresponding urine samples. VII was still detected in blood 2 h after the infusion was terminated. VII was previously shown by us to be an intermediate in the formation of certain urinary products of PGF2 alpha. These other catabolites of PGF2 alpha were also observed in both blood and urine although their levels were greater in the urine. Our observations indicate that a long lasting catabolite of PGF2 alpha, i.e. VII, as well as all the urinary catabolites of PGF2 alpha appear in the circulation. These results suggest that these catabolites are mostly (although not exclusively) extrarenal in origin (probably all hepatic) entering the circulation prior to their excretion by the kidney."
