https://openalex.org/W2084881904,"The opiate-like peptide β-endorphin and adrenocorticotropin are concomitantly secreted in increased amounts by the adenohypophysis in response to acute stress or long-term adrenalectomy as well as in vitro in response to purified corticotropin releasing factor and other secretagogues. Conversely, administration of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone inhibits the secretion of both adrenocorticotropin and β-endorphin. Thus, both hormones possess common and identical regulatory mechanisms and there may be a functional role for circulating β-endorphin."

https://openalex.org/W1576614076,"Xanthine oxidase, acting on acetaldehyde under aerobic conditions, produces a flux of O2- and H2O2 which attacks artificial liposomes and washed human erythrocytes. The liposomes were peroxidized and the erythrocytes suffered oxidation of hemoglobin followed by lysis. The oxidation of hemoglobin followed by lysis. The oxidation of hemoglobin, within the exposed erythrocytes, could be largely prevented by prior conversion to carbon monoxyhemoglobin, without preventing lysis. Hemolysis thus appeared to be a consequence of direct oxidative attack on the cell stroma. The enzyme-generated flux of O2- and of H2O2 also inactivated the xanthine oxidase. Superoxide dismutase or catalase, present in the suspending medium, protected the liposomes against peroxidation, the erythrocytes against lysis, and the xanthine oxidase against inactivation. Scavengers of O2('deltag), such as histidine or 2,5-dimethylfuran, which do not react with O2- or H2O2, also prevented peroxidation of liposomes and lysis of erythrocytes when present at low concentrations. In contrast a scavenger of OH-, such as mannitol was ineffective at low concentrations and provided significant protection only at much higher concentrations. It is proposed that O2- and H2O2 cooperated in producing OH- and O2('deltag), which were the proximate causes of lipid peroxidation and of hemolysis."

https://openalex.org/W1973014323,"Nuclear and cytoplasmic viral RNAs, synthesized in cells productively infected with herpes simplex virus type 1 at early and late times post-infection and in the presence of DNA and protein synthesis inhibitors, have been analyzed by blot hybridization to viral DNA fragments generated by single and double digests with the Hind III, Bgl II and Hpa I restriction endonucleases. RNA transcribed in the presence of cycloheximide (immediate early, made using a cell RNA polymerase) hybridizes to restricted portions of the HSV-1 genome, and the hybridization patterns of both nuclear and cytoplasmic immediate early RNAs are similar. This finding suggests that synthesis of immediate early RNA within the nucleus may be restricted; alternatively, there may be rapid processing of primary transcripts. Virus-induced protein synthesis is a prerequisite for the switch from the restricted immediate early to the early pattern of transcription in which there is hybridization to all the DNA fragments. The hybridization pattern of RNA labeled in the presence of cytosine arabinoside resembles that of early RNA. Late RNA also hybridizes to all the DNA fragments, but the relative hybridization to the individual DNA fragments is different between early and late times. When late nuclear and late cytoplasmic RNAs are compared, there is greater relative hybridization to several different regions of the genome with nuclear RNA. This implies that either translocation of transcripts to the cytoplasm is regulated or that certain RNAs are degraded more rapidly within the cytoplasm."

https://openalex.org/W2022071328,"Microinjection of nanomole amounts of kainic acid, a heterocyclic analog of glutamate, into the cerebellums of adult hamsters and rats causes rapid degeneration of Purkinje, basket, stellate, and Golgi II cells, neurons that receive synaptic input from granule cells, whereas the granule cells themselves are spared. This selectivity is consistent with the evidence that glutamate is the granule cell transmitter and supports the hypothesis that kainic acid exerts its neurotoxic effects through glutamate receptors."

https://openalex.org/W2165492599,"A method has been devised which permits mapping of transcripts by a two-step hybridization procedure (sandwich hybridization). RNA extracted from cells infected with an adenovirus-SV40 hybrid (Ad2+ND1) was hybridized to restriction endonuclease fragments of adenovirus type 2 (Ad2) DNA immobilized on nitrocellulose filters. RNAs containing both Ad2 and SV40 sequences formed duplexes through their Ad2 sequences, leaving their SV40 sequences as protruding tails. Annealing with 32P-labeled SV40 DNA caused these tails to become labeled, permitting autoradiographic identification of the sequences of Ad2 DNA which are homologous to the RNA. The high sensitivity of this technique, achieved through the use of 32P-labeled RNA of high specific activity, has led to the observation that hybridization of Ad2+ND1 RNA occurs at several locations on the Ad2 genome, in addition to the expected sites of hybridization proximal to the SV40 insertion."

https://openalex.org/W2072782647,"Mutants deficient in adenosine kinase or adenine phosphoribosyltransferase activities were selected from the WI-L2 line of human lymphoblasts. The adenosine kinase-deficient mutant was still as sensitive as its parent to growth inhibition caused by adenosine when adenosine deaminase was inhibited. Similarly, the adenine phosphoribosyltransferase mutant remained sensitive to growth inhibition caused by adenine. Thus, the toxicity of adenine and adenosine to human lymphoblasts is not mediated by nucleotides to which they may be converted."
https://openalex.org/W1531808272,"Poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase has been purified approximately 5000-fold from rat liver nuclei. The activity of the purified enzyme is absolutely dependent upon the presence of native or synthetic DNA, and the further addition of histone(s) stimulates the activity 3- to 5-fold. When the ADP-ribosylated material synthesized in the absence or presence of various histones is analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the major product in all cases migrates between histones H1 and H3-H2B with the same RF value of 0.58 relative to the marker dye. No ADP-ribose was found to co-electrophorese with any of thehistones. The addition of histones does not affect the chain number of the poly(ADP-ribose) synthesized but does result in an increase in the average chain length of the polymer. In the presence of histones, the Km for NAD+ decreases from 80 micron to 25 micron and the Vmax doubles. These results indicate that, in the purified poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase system, histones are not ADP-robosylated but act as allosteric activators."
https://openalex.org/W2160571421,"A previous report from this laboratory showed that purified DNAs are transcribed after injection into the nucleus of Xenopus laevis oocytes (Mertz and Gurdon, 1977). Here we demonstrate that at least some of the RNA synthesized is translated within these injected cells to produce the correct protein products. Injection of Simian Virus 40 DNA into oocytes induces the synthesis of at least two proteins not normally synthesized in these cells. Using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and well characterized deletion mutants of SV40 that produce proteins of smaller size, we show that these two proteins are, indeed, the virus-coded proteins VP1 and VP3. Synthesis of VP1 and VP3 is inhibited by alpha-amanitin and, therefore, presumably mediated by a type II RNA polymerase. We also present evidence indicating that a histone-like protein is induced after the injection of a cloned plasmid DNA that codes for the Drosophila melanogaster histone proteins. This in vivo coupled transcription-translation system should be useful for identifying and mapping proteins coded by cloned eucaryotic DNAs."

https://openalex.org/W2006921623,A highly synchronized ultradian cortisol rhythm with a predominant periodicity of 85 to 90 minutes was observed in eight isolated monkeys; this rhythm may be harmonically related to the circadian rhythm. The persistence of this synchronized rhythm during supramaximal infusions of adrenocorticotropin not only suggests that feedback is not causative but also challenges the classic concept that bursts of cortisol secretion are dependent upon an immediately preceding release of adrenocorticotropin.

https://openalex.org/W1985280344,"We have investigated the effect of interferon on SV40 gene expression late in the lytic cycle, after early functions have been expressed and viral DNA replication has been initiated. Whereas pretreatment with interferon prior to infection reduces the amount of early SV40 RNA, post-infection treatment does not inhibit viral RNA synthesis. Viral 19S and 16S RNA species are found undiminished in quantity and poly(A) content. Despite the apparent normalcy of viral RNA classes, however, there is a marked reduction in the synthesis of their protein products, both T antigen and capsid polypeptides. The association of viral RNA with heavy polyribosomes is strongly reduced. On the other hand, there is no degradation of nonviral polyribosomes and the synthesis of most cellular proteins continues. These experiments demonstrate that late in infection, interferon treatment results in an inhibition of viral mRNA translation."

K., Kleinzeller, A., and Schultz, S. G., eds) pp. 69-86, Academic Press, New York, to depolarize the plasma membrane of Neurospora, increase levels of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in the organism. The treatments include those producing large transport fluxes of metabolizable or nonmetabolizable compounds, rapid temperature drops, and addition of agents which uncouple oxidative phosphorylation. Severe mechanical stress, which may also act to depolarize the plasma membrane, leads to increases in cyclic AMP. The maximal depolarization appears to precede the maximal cyclic AMP levels. It is proposed that the membrane depolarization produces the increased cyclic AMP levels by stimulating the plasma membrane-bound adenylate cyclase and that cyclic AMP may be important to the maintenance of membrane integrity."

https://openalex.org/W1593792753,"Systematic substitution of the natural L-amino acids in neurotensin by their D isomers reveals that the COOH-terminal portion of this tridecapeptide is required for binding to mast cell receptors: D-amino acid replacements from Pro10 through Leu13 substantially decrease that binding. Either blockage of the COOH-terminal carboxyl group as with N-methylamidation, or formation of a cyclic structure by the inclusion of a disulfide bond, a Cys2,13 substitution, markedly reduces the specific binding to mast cell receptor sites. Modifications in the NH2-terminal portion of neurotensin do not affect the binding to mast cells. However, D-Arg8 and D-Arg9 substitutions increase binding by factors of 5- to 6-fold. The hydroxyl group at position 3 or 11 is not essential for binding since Phe3 or Phe11 is equivalent to Tyr3 or Tyr11. The COOH-terminal penta- and hexapeptides are able to displace approximately 70% 125I-neurotensin relative to the intact peptide. Of 18 other biologically active peptides tested, only xenopsin, a naturally occurring COOH-terminal analog of neurotensin, and bradykinin effectively compete in the binding assay to an extent of 60 and 100%, respectively. Histamine, diphenhydramine, and noradrenaline are ineffective in this regard."

https://openalex.org/W2032332732,"Abstract Somatic cell hybrids derived from seven independent fusions between mouse X human and hamster X human parental cells were examined for their ability to support the replication of the baboon endogenous type C virus. These hybrids preferentially segregated human chromosomes while retaining rodent chromosomes, as demonstrated by karyotypic and isozyme analysis. A total of 41 primary colonies and 33 secondary subclones were analyzed for viral replication, as well as for the presence of enzyme structural gene markers for 19 of 23 human chromosomes. A syntenic association was seen between the ability of the baboon type C virus to infect and replicate in hybrid cultures and the expression of human malic enzyme-1 (assigned to human chromosome 6). Analysis of 86 highly segregated subclones derived from cells preinfected with baboon type C virus showed that the continued production of baboon type C virus segregated concordantly with the expression of three enzyme genes assigned to human chromosome 6 (malic enzyme-1, phosphoglucomutase-3 and superoxide dismutase-2). Subclones of infected hybrids which lost chromosome 6 and failed to release virus also failed to synthesize the virus-coded major structural protein p30. No syntenic association between baboon virus expression and any of 18 other human chromosomes was observed. These studies define a new gene (designated Bevi ) on human chromosome 6 which dominantly controls the replication of baboon type C virus. The data suggest that Bevi may be a preferred integration site for the baboon type C DNA provirus in the human genome."

https://openalex.org/W1521784658,"UDP-glucuronate carboxy-lyase has been demonstrated in chick chondrocytes in tissue culture. It occurs in the particulate fraction, and its activity is stimulated by exogenous NAD. The enzyme is allosterically activated by UDP-glucuronate and inhibited by UDP-xylose, n Values of 2.8 indicate positive cooperativity of at least three interacting sites on the enzyme. These data suggest that UDP-xylose concentration in chondrocytes is regulated by substrate activation and product inhibition of UDP-glucuronate carboxy-lyase. Activity levels of the enzyme during growth of the cells peak towards mid-log phase and decline thereafter, closely paralleling levels of chondroitin sulfate glycosyltransferases determined previously (Schwartz, N. B. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 3346-3351). Thus, it appears that during chondrocyte development a common mechanism governs induction of glycosyltransferases and of UDP-glucuronate carboxy-lyase."

https://openalex.org/W2131260095,"1. A nucleoside triphosphatase (EC 3.6.1.3) was solubi- lized from avian myeloblastosis virus after treatment with ethanol and sonication at an alkaline pH. The enzyme was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, chromatogra- phy on Bio-Gel A-0.5m, and sucrose density gradient cen- trifugation. 2. In sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gels, the protein dissociated into five subunits with molecular weights of 62,000, 60,000, 28,000, 24,000, and 18,000. Assuming a sub- unit structure of (~.&y 6 E (based on stain intensities), a molecular weight of about 314,000 was calculated. In su- crose density sedimentation, an s~,,,~,. value of 19 S was observed, corresponding to a molecular weight of 650,000 suggesting formation of a dimer. 3. The enzyme required Ca’+ or MgZ+ for activity and hydrolyzed ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP, and ITP at a similar rate. ADP was hydrolyzed at one-tenth the rate of ATP and no significant hydrolysis of AMP or PP, was detected. 4. The enzyme activity was resistant to a variety of inhibitors of mitochondrial and (Na+-K+)-ATPase but was sensitive to mercurials and N, N ‘-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD). Treatment of the enzyme with phospholipase A stimulated ATPase activity and reduced its sensitivity to DCCD. The enzyme was extremely sensitive to most of the ionic and nonionic detergents such as cholate, deoxycho- late, Triton X-100, Tween 80, NP-40, Lubrol, or lysolecithin, which explains the failure of previous attempts to solubilize the enzyme. Trypsin inactivated the ATPase activity which was protected in the presence of ATP or EDTA. 5. A rabbit antiserum against the enzyme inhibited the activity by 40 to 50%. The protein was, however, quantita- tively precipitated and the antiserum-insensitive activity was recovered in the precipitate."
https://openalex.org/W1492827965,Abstract Heterologous human lipoproteins were infused into rats in order to change acutely the lipoprotein pattern to a predominant kind and the effect on hepatic cholesterogenesis was subsequently observed. A 4-h intravenous infusion of human low density and very low density lipoproteins into rats produced a significant decrease in the incorporation of acetate into cholesterol in both liver slices and homogenates. An infusion of similar concentrations of human high density lipoprotein produced a significant increase in hepatic cholesterol synthesis. These infusions did not change mevalonate conversion to cholesterol in either the homogenates or slices. Concomitant with the changes in hepatic cholesterol synthesis were changes of similar magnitudes in the activity of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. These alterations in hepatic cholesterol synthesis were associated with significant changes in microsomal cholesterol content. There was a significant increase in hepatic cholesterol synthesis with the infusion of apoproteins of high density lipoprotein. The apoproteins of very low density lipoprotein had no effect on hepatic cholesterogenesis. These studies indicate that circulating lipoproteins modify hepatic cholesterol synthesis and that the apoproteins of these lipoproteins may themselves be important for this action.
https://openalex.org/W1675072664,"A simple and rapid procedure has been found for the preparation of higly pure alkaline form fructose-1,6-diphosphatase from turkey liver. The protein is tetrameric and is composed of subunits comprised of a 29,000 molecular weight core fragment and an associated 7,000-dalton S-peptide. Large single crystals of the protein, suitable for x-ray diffraction analysis, are produced in the course of the preparation. These are of space group R3 and have rhombohedral cell dimensions of a = 153 A and delta = 163 degrees (equivalent hexagonal dimensions a = 303 A, c = 75 A). There is one entire tetramer of 144,000 daltons in the asymmetric unit. The enzymatic properties of this enzyme appear to be very similar to those reported for the protein from other organisms, but its unique propensity to crystallize opens the way for a full three-dimensional structural analysis."
