https://openalex.org/W2093541933,"The discovery of a new type of fossil nuclear track in mica is reported. This track is produced by the recoil nucleus accompanying the alpha-particle decay of uranium and thorium impurities. The tracks are very short and can be seen with phase contrast microscopy. Measurement of fossil alpha-recoil track densities, coupled with determinations of the thorium and uranium contents, provides a new dating technique analogous to the previously discovered ""fission-track method."" The primary advantage of the alpha-recoil method is a several-thousand-fold increase in sensitivity over the fission-track technique. The alpha-recoil method should also prove useful in studying the problem of extinct isotopes in meteorites."

Accordingly, organic derivation of the material seems very probable. This conclusion is consistent with a model of the existence of organic evolution and biologic activity in times certainly older than 2.15 x 10(9) years."
https://openalex.org/W2085175538,"Measurements have been made of the number of spray droplets produced by the impact of a water drop on water, and of the charge to mass ratio for these droplets. For a drop 3 millimeters in diameter, the number of spray droplets increases linearly with the fall-distance of the drop over the range 10 to 200 centimeters. When the drop falls 100 centimeters, about 25 spray droplets are produced. The majority of the droplets carry a negative charge, and the ratio of the charge to the mass varies from 4 to 28 electrostatic units per gram."

https://openalex.org/W1988171871,"A method is described for detecting extraterrestrial life, based on catalysis of isotopic oxygen exchange between water and oxygen-containing anions such as phosphate, nitrate, or sulfate. This catalytic activity appears to be unique to living systems. Its applicability requires very few assumptions concerning the chemical nature of ""life."" Data obtained so far indicate that the experiment is sound and technically feasible."
https://openalex.org/W2082680093,"Infrared images of the thermal anomaly associated with the lunar crater Tycho were obtained during the lunar night after Tycho had ceased to be illuminated by the Suin for as long as 97 hours. In agreement with results of previous studies, these measurements show that the crater is warmer than its surroundings during the lunar night, and that the temperature of the thermal anomaly gradually decreases with time, being no longer detectable after new moon. This work provides strong evidence that the steeper crater walls facing the Sun before local sunset are warmer throughout the cooling phase, and that the Tycho anomaly is thus produced by solar, rather than internal, heat."

https://openalex.org/W2035620077,"Many small spiders produce threads of different diameters, some of which are submicroscopic. When the threads are subjected to an environment of tobacco smoke and then examined microscopically, the invisible threads are manifested as particles in a line with no visible connection. These threads are used to support microscopic water droplets in single-particle scattering experiments."

https://openalex.org/W2054456539,Ground-based observations of Martian relief may be possible when the Earth-Mars geometry is optimum and the observing conditions are near perfect. There is some evidence that detectable relief is present. Groundbased observations of Martian relief during the coming opposition will be optimum between 1 February and 1 March and between 1 June and 15 August 1967.
