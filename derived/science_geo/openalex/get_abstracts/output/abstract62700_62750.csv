https://openalex.org/W1525083915,"Abstract Three different methods are described for separating hemoglobins from carbonic anhydrases in hemolysates from human erythrocytes. The preferred method involves adsorption on diethylaminoethyl Sephadex at pH 8.7 followed by selective elution of the carbonic anhydrases. Carbonic anhydrases A, B, and C are subsequently separated from each other on DEAE-Sephadex by elution with 0.05 m Trischloride buffer at pH 8.7. Complete amino acid analyses are reported for carbonic anhydrases B and C, with results in good accord with those of preparations obtained in other laboratories by different procedures. The partial specific volume of carbonic anhydrase B is found to be 0.731 ml per g and its intrinsic viscosity is 2.76 ml per g. Molecular weights from sedimentation, diffusion, and sedimentation equilibrium are close to 28,000 for both enzymes; estimates from the amino acid analyses are 28,730 for Enzyme B, and 30,000 for Enzyme C. The s020, w values are close to 2.75 S for both enzymes. The values for both s and D are lower than others previously reported, by a factor close to 1.2, but the resulting molecular weights are in good agreement with others. Studies of optical rotatory dispersion between 330 and 600 mµ are reported for the native and the acid-denatured carbonic anhydrases B and C, and also for solutions containing the substrate bicarbonate ion and, in other experiments, the inhibitor acetazolamide. The data in all these solvents give a good fit to the simple Drude equation, with λc values that lie below 210 mµ for native Enzyme B and average close to 210 mµ for Enzyme C. Analysis of the data in terms of the Moffitt-Yang and Shechter-Blout equations is also reported, but a computer analysis indicates that the basis for applying the former equation is dubious. There appears to be a small amount of helix (10 to 20%) in the acid-denatured proteins; the complexity of the optical rotatory dispersion spectra of the native proteins makes inferences concerning helix content uncertain (see following paper). Studies on the esterase activity of Enzyme B, with p-nitrophenyl acetate as substrate, are reported. Esterase activity rises with increasing pH between 7 and 9.5. Acetazolamide is a powerful inhibitor of the esterase activity, with Ki = 0.3 µm at pH 7, 0.9 µm at pH 8, and approximately 2.8 µm at pH 9. The inhibition appears to be noncompetitive."

Exploration, play, vocalization, and disturbance occurred most frequently with pictures of monkeys threatening and pictures of infants. From 2.5 to 4 months threat pictures yielded a high frequency of disturbance.Lever-touching to turn threat pictures on was very low during this period. Pictures of infants and of threat thus appear to have prepotent general activating properties, while pictures of threat appear to release a developmentally determined, inborn fear response."

https://openalex.org/W2084126568,"Quantitative micro-complement fixation was used to compare human serum albumin with the serum albumins of apes, monkeys, and prosimians. The results are consistent with those obtained by other immunological techniques, and they are consistent with the accepted phylogenetic position of these groups. The method requires much less antigen and antibody is more sensitive to small differences in albumin structure. A large scale survey of species differences in protein structure is possible with less than a milliliter of antiserum."

https://openalex.org/W1580976792,"Abstract Rate constants were measured for the reversible oxidation-reduction reaction between ferricytochrome c and ferrohexacyanide. [see PDF for equation] Kinetic measurements in the pH range 7.0 to 9.4 were made by the temperature jump technique, and comparative values of Keq were determined by a spectrophotometric titration method based on absorption difference at 550 mµ between ferri- and ferrocytochrome c. Also, stopped flow experiments at 550 mµ were performed at pH 9.5. In all of these experiments, excess sodium ferrocyanide (8 x 10-3 m) was mixed with varying concentrations (5 x 10-6 to 1.6 x 10-4 m) of ferricytochrome c at a constant ionic strength of 0.2. The quotient k(ox)k/(red) is essentially pH-independent in the pH region investigated; k(red) was found to be 2.4 x 104 m-1 sec-1, and k(ox), 0.87 x 107 m-1 sec-1. In the pH region investigated, the over-all equilibrium constant for the reaction, Keq, increased by a factor of 4 with increasing pH. The stopped flow experiments indicated that a slow process with a half-time of several seconds is responsible for the difference between k(ox)/k(red) and Keq values at alkaline pH values. The experiments indicate that pH has no effect on the electron transfer process itself. The pH dependence of the oxidation-reduction potential of cytochrome c at alkaline pH is evidently due to the effect of pH on a slow isomerization of ferricytochrome c, with increasing pH decreasing the concentration of cytochrome c which participates in the electron transfer process."
https://openalex.org/W1509813067,"Abstract Autolysis of cell walls of the highly transformable strain 168 of Bacillus subtilis is accompanied by the release of N-terminal L-alanine without a concomitant release of C-terminal amino acids, reducing groups, or phosphomonoester groups. These observations show that the enzyme is an N-acylmuramyl-L-alanine amidase. Autolysis follows first order kinetics, requires an energy of activation of 9.2 kcal per mole, and results in the hydrolysis of 87% of the amide bonds between muramic acid and L-alanine. Since the enzyme is most active during logarithmic growth of the population, it is suggested that its action coupled with a transpeptidase is involved in the expansion of the cell wall."
https://openalex.org/W2025255485,"Examination of the structural organization of the auditory system of the brain stem shows that the system is composed of a number of separate ascending pathways. This suggests that there may be at least two auditory systems, analogous to the rod and cone pathways in vision. We examined this possibility by investigating the variation in relative size of the medial and lateral superior olivary nuclei in a number of different mammalian species."
https://openalex.org/W1527734167,"Abstract Studies of optical rotatory dispersion (ORD) and circular dichroism (CD) are reported on human carbonic anhydrases B and C in the spectral region below 320 mµ. Most of the observed CD spectrum of each enzyme could be described in terms of three principal Gaussian bands: a strong negative band near 216 mµ, a weaker negative band near 270 to 275 mµ, and a positive band intermediate between the other two in position. Above 260 mµ, all CD values are negative; there is clear evidence of fine structure above 280 mµ, involving at least two additional CD bands. The ORD spectra above 260 mµ show several peaks and troughs, which are characteristic for each enzyme. The principal troughs at shorter wave lengths lie at 222 mµ for Enzyme B and at 226 mµ for Enzyme C. At still shorter wave lengths, the ORD values rise to low peaks, at 204 mµ, with [m'] = -300 for Enzyme B and +2750 for Enzyme C. These patterns are very different from those characteristic of either α-helical or β structures. Asymmetrical interactions involving the aromatic side chains almost certainly make important contributions to ORD and CD at the shorter wave lengths, as they clearly do at the longer wave lengths, above 250 mµ. On acid denaturation, the longer wave length Cotton effects vanish, and the ORD and CD spectra alter in such a way as to suggest the presence of 10 to 20% α-helix in the acid-denatured proteins. The changes on exposure to high pH are more complex. Near pH 11, the negative CD band near 270 to 275 mµ becomes less intense and shifts to longer wave lengths; the positive band at 232 mµ in Enzyme B also shifts to longer wave lengths. It is tentatively suggested that these bands arise in part from interactions of tyrosine residues. The fine structure pattern between 280 and 310 mµ undergoes changes, but in Enzyme B it still persists even at pH 13. Interactions involving tryptophan may be involved. The positive CD band at 249 mµ in Enzyme C disappears at pH 11.5, and the ORD spectrum of this enzyme also indicates more drastic structural alterations at high pH than those found in Enzyme B. The ORD spectra of both enzymes at pH near 13 show two troughs, one near 231, the other near 210 mµ, the former being deeper for Enzyme B, the latter for Enzyme C. The CD bands of Enzyme B are still observed in 2 m guanidine-HCl, although the long wave ultraviolet bands are weaker than in the native protein; in 4 m guanidine-HCl they are abolished. ORD studies of the two enzymes in 1 m guanidine-HCl indicate that the Cotton effects due to the aromatic absorption bands disappear rapidly in this solvent in solutions of Enzyme C, whereas Enzyme B is much more stable. ORD spectra have been calculated from the CD data for the native enzymes by the use of a Kronig-Kramers transform with a computer program. Comparison with the observed ORD data shows good general agreement with the pattern of the observed troughs and peaks, especially for Enzyme C. The computed spectra are displaced to more positive [m'] values than the observed spectra, indicating that there must be large negative contributions to the circular dichroism at wave lengths below 200 mµ."

https://openalex.org/W1526506965,"Abstract An enzyme hydrolyzing 4- to 8-carbon γ-lactones has been purified 12- to 15-fold from rat liver and from human plasma. In rat liver the enzyme is located in the microsomal fraction and may be solubilized by deoxycholate treatment and separated from microsomal B-esterase by ammonium sulfate fractionation. The effects of a series of inhibitors on γ-lactonase, B-esterase purified from rat liver microsomes, and plasma cholinesterase were compared. The lactonase was inhibited by 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetate and by 0.1 mm p-chloromercuribenzoate but was unaffected by sodium benzoate, NaF, neostigmine, eserine, and diisopropylfluorophosphate. The last compound inactivates completely both the B-esterase and the cholinesterase, which were unaffected by ethylenediaminetetraacetate and were effectively inhibited by neostigmine. Together with substrate selectivity, these distinctions in inhibition establish the three enzymes as separate entities. The enzymatic nature of the reaction is evidenced by inactivation upon brief heating to 90°, purification of the active protein, a biologic Q10 = 1.56, a zero order reaction in either direction, and pH activity curves. In addition, no lactonase activity was found in homogenates of rat brain, spleen, kidney, heart, and diaphragm, although rat serum and plasma do contain the enzyme. The γ-lactonase enzymes also catalyze lactonization of the corresponding γhydroxy acids. The pH optimum for this reaction is 6.0 as compared to 8.6 for the hydrolytic reaction. The stoichiometry of lactone-hydroxy acid interconversion catalyzed by γ-lactonase was established by gas chromatographic identification of synthesized valerolactone and by acid regeneration of enzymatically degraded valerolactone. The enzyme does not hydrolyze simple aliphatic esters, acetylcholine, sugar lactones, or substituted aliphatic lactones such as pantolactone or 3-hydroxy-4-butyrolactone."

https://openalex.org/W1540895220,"Abstract Procedures are described for the preparation of phosphoglucomutases from Bacillus cereus and Micrococcus lysodeikticus. Both require Mg++ and glucose 1,6-diphosphate for activity which is optimal at pH 8.3 and 8.5, respectively; both enzymes rapidly equilibrate 32P among α-d-glucose-1-P, glucose-6-P, and glucose-1,6-di-P. In contrast to rabbit muscle and Escherichia coli P-glucomutases, neither of these bacterial enzymes could be shown to form a stable phosphoenzyme by reaction with glucose-1,6-di-P. Correspondingly, the rabbit muscle and E. coli enzymes exhibited shuttle kinetics whereas Lineweaver-Burk plots with the B. cereus and M. lysodeikticus enzymes yielded families of converging lines, suggesting a metathetical reaction between glucose-1,6-di-P and glucose-1-P on the enzyme surface. p-Chloromercuribenzoate partially inhibits the rabbit enzyme, completely inhibits the E. coli enzyme, activates and then deactivates the shark enzyme, activates and then inhibits the M. lysodeikticus enzyme, and is without effect on the B. cereus enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1526750440,"Abstract A procedure involving precipitation with ammonium sulfate and chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose is described for isolating crystalline carbamate kinase from Streptococcus faecalis. The crystalline enzyme sedimented as a single component, s20,w = 4.1 S at 8.8 mg ml-1, and showed only traces of two other components on electrophoresis of a 1% solution in starch gel. The enzyme bound 1 mole of adenosine diphosphate per 33,000 g of protein with a dissociation constant of 6.6 µm; the minimum molecular weight from the amino acid composition was found to be 31,000. Double reciprocal plots of initial velocity with respect to substrate concentration were linear in a range of substrate concentrations encompassing the values of the Michaelis constants. In the forward direction: V = 92 moles/31,000 g x sec, Km carbamate = 80 µm, Kmatp = 8 µm, and the dissociation constant of the binary complex, enzyme-adenosine triphosphate, is 70 µm. In the reverse direction: V = 730 moles/31,000 g x sec, Km carbamyl-p = 100 µm, Kmadp = 50 µm, and the dissociation constant of the enzyme-ADP complex is 5 µm. The product inhibition patterns fit a mechanism in which a nucleotide is the first substrate to add and the last to dissociate from the enzyme and in which a ternary complex is formed. The rate-limiting steps are the dissociations of the nucleotides from the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W120407319,"Abstract An map procedure is described for the identification of the products of action of hydrolases on malto-oligosaccharides and for the differentiation of α-1,4-glucan hydrolases. The method involves chromatography of malto-oligosaccharides-1-14C in one direction on paper, incubation of the oligosaccharides with the hydrolase after spraying the enzyme directly on the chromatogram, separation of the hydrolytic products by chromatography in a second direction, and location of the radioactive hydrolytic products by autoradiography. Characteristic oligosaccharide maps are recorded for the hydrolases from Bacillus subtilis, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus delemar, saliva, and sweet potato. A new enzyme, α-1,4-glucan:α-1,4-glucan 4-maltosyltransferase, has been detected by the use of the technique with enzyme preparations from B. subtilis and R. delemar."
https://openalex.org/W1596659034,"Abstract Calcium ions have been found to activate and stabilize γ-lactonase specifically. Hydrolytic activity at pH 8.6 requires 10 µm calcium ions, while the lactonization rate at pH 6.0 is maximal with 10 mm calcium. At pH 6.0, hydrolysis is increased proportionally with synthesis upon the addition of calcium, indicating that the metal ion interacts with the enzyme and not the substrate. Calcium ion, 1 mm, serves to stabilize γ-lactonase prepared from rat liver microsomes. Zn++, Cu++, Mn++, Mg++, Fe+++, Ni++, Co++, Hg++, Na+, and K+ either inhibit γ-lactonase or are without effect, depending upon the pH of the assay and the particular metal ion involved. Magnesium appears to inhibit specifically only the hydrolytic activity of γ-lactonase without affecting its lactonizing function. Ethylenediaminetetraacetate-calcium chelates can replace calcium in activation of the enzyme, indicating a very high affinity constant for the lactonase-calcium complex. Four- to eight-carbon lactones are effective substrates for the enzymes, with Km values ranging from 1 to 13 mm. The values for the corresponding γ-hydroxy acids as substrates for lactone synthesis run about 4-fold higher. The enzyme preparations from liver microsomes and human plasma have similar, but not identical, kinetic properties. Equilibrium constants at near neutral pH values and 27° have been determined for the 4- to 8-carbon lactone-hydroxy acid couples, with the use of γ-lactonase. Except for the 4-carbon substrate, a sizeable fraction of these compounds exists in the lactone form at equilibrium (10 to 20%)."

https://openalex.org/W1527976759,"Abstract The optical rotatory dispersion of bovine carbonic anhydrase B and human carbonic anhydrase B and C is investigated between 350 and 190 mµ as a function of pH, temperature, ionic strength, and solvent composition. Each form of carbonic anhydrase can exist in three different states: (a) native state, pH 6.5, 25°; (b) below pH 4, 25°; and (c) 8 m urea, 25°. The rotatory dispersion curves for these states differ considerably. In State a, all forms show a rotatory dispersion dominated by Cotton effects due to aromatic side chains. By comparing the protein optical rotatory dispersion to that of aromatic amino acids, contributions from both tryptophan and tyrosine side chains can be identified. Whereas the magnitude of tryptophan Cotton effects is constant for all forms of carbonic anhydrase, the tyrosine contributions vary considerably. In State b, all forms show a dispersion of simple polypeptide type with small helical contribution, human form B having the highest (approximately 12%) and bovine form B the lowest (4%). The rotation in both States a and b is different for each of the carbonic anhydrase forms investigated. Tentative conclusions regarding the helix content in native state favor a low helix content for all forms. In State c, all forms of the enzyme show a plain dispersion curve, with no trough above 220 mµ. The enhanced rotatory strength of aromatic transitions can, at present, best be explained as due to the perturbing effect from vicinal side chains arranged in an asymmetrical way around the aromatic chromophore."
https://openalex.org/W1565130021,"Butyryl coenzyme A dehydrogenase and a transfer protein required for maximal activity as measured by reduction of 2,6-dichloroindophenol have been solubilized from monkey (Macaca mulatta) liver mitochondria by sonic irradiation. The dehydrogenase has been purified approximately 60-fold and identified as a flavin adenine dinucleotide-specific flavoprotein. The required protein has been found to be indistinguishable from the electron-transferring flavoprotein (transfer protein) of the sarcosine dehydrogenase pathway as measured by extent of solubilization, manner of precipitation with ammonium sulfate, and adsorption on and elution from diethylaminoethyl cellulose. Purified preparations of transfer protein, measured at 450 mµ, were reduced by catalytic amounts of butyryl dehydrogenase and sarcosine dehydrogenase with each enzyme causing approximately one-half of the total reduction. It is concluded that the transfer protein requirement for the oxidation of butyryl coenzyme A is met by the FAD-specific electron-transferring flavoprotein. The oxidation of radiosarcosine, in the presence of limiting amounts of transfer protein, has been shown to be inhibited 10 to 15% by reduced but not by oxidized butyryl dehydrogenase. Simultaneous measurements of 2,6-dichloroindophenol reduction have shown the combined rates of the two dehydrogenase-catalyzed reductions to be greater than the rate of the faster of the individual reactions. Purified transfer protein has been shown to be inactivated by heat treatment, yielding different curves for activity against temperature of inactivation for each activity monitoring dehydrogenase. Presently available evidence suggests that the mitochondrial oxidations of butyryl coenzyme A and of sarcosine are both mediated by a common electron-transferring flavoprotein."

These changes progress against a background of structural and compositional modifications in the membrane.

https://openalex.org/W1505523451,"Abstract Hydrogenase activity was found to be associated with the particulate matter of cells of Vibrio succinogenes after lysis with EDTA at pH 9.0. Solubilization of the enzyme was effected by treatment of the particulate fraction at pH 11.0. While the particulate hydrogenase was unaffected by sulfhydryl compounds, the solubilized enzyme had an absolute sulfhydryl requirement. Proteolytic enzymes such as pronase and trypsin, as well as ethylenediaminetetraacetate, could substitute for β-mercaptoethanol in stimulating soluble hydrogenase activity. Incubation at pH 7.0 of the pH 11.0-soluble hydrogenase with the pH 11.0-extracted particulate fraction resulted in the incorporation of most or all of the hydrogenase into the particulate fraction. The reconstituted, particulate hydrogenase, which no longer required sulfhydryl compounds for activity, could be separated into a soluble, hydrogenase-containing fraction and an inactive, insoluble fraction by re-exposure to pH 11.0. These results suggest that solubilization and reconstitution of the particulate system is a reversible, pH-dependent process."

After infection of Bacillus subtilis SB19 with phage SP5C, a new enzyme activity, deoxythymidylate 5'-nucleotidase, can be detected. The appearance of this activity requires phage infection, is inhibited by chloramphenicol, and is not induced by mitomycin.

The enzyme cleaves deoxythymidylic acid, deoxy-5-methylcytidylic acid, and ribothymidylic acid to produce the respective nucleosides and Pi at relative rates of 100:45:40, respectively. It cleaves fluorine derivatives of deoxythymidylic acid. It does not hydrolyze deoxythymidine triphosphate, other naturally occurring nucleoside 5'monophosphates, or nucleoside 3'-monophosphates.
