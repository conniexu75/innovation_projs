https://openalex.org/W2128114769,"The proliferation of large-scale DNA-sequencing projects in recent years has driven a search for alternative methods to reduce time and cost. Here we describe a scalable, highly parallel sequencing system with raw throughput significantly greater than that of state-of-the-art capillary electrophoresis instruments. The apparatus uses a novel fibre-optic slide of individual wells and is able to sequence 25 million bases, at 99% or better accuracy, in one four-hour run. To achieve an approximately 100-fold increase in throughput over current Sanger sequencing technology, we have developed an emulsion method for DNA amplification and an instrument for sequencing by synthesis using a pyrosequencing protocol optimized for solid support and picolitre-scale volumes. Here we show the utility, throughput, accuracy and robustness of this system by shotgun sequencing and de novo assembly of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome with 96% coverage at 99.96% accuracy in one run of the machine. The race is on for a big prize: the job of providing the world's DNA sequencing laboratories with the successor to the ‘Sanger-based’ technology that gave us the first wave of genome sequences. One technology in the frame is that produced by 454 Life Sciences Corporation of Branford, Connecticut. Today's technology reads 67,000 base pairs per hour; this new approach is 100 times faster, reading 6 million base pairs per hour. The improved performance results from using picolitre-sized chemical reactors, enhanced light-emitting sequencing chemistries and complex informatics. Further miniaturization of the system is planned. Such leaps in technology may one day make it possible to analyse an individual's genome before designing therapy: the ultimate in personalized medicine."

We used high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional calculations to unravel the local structure of surface and subsurface oxygen vacancies on the (111) surface. Electrons left behind by released oxygen localize on cerium ions. Clusters of more than two vacancies exclusively expose these reduced cerium ions, primarily by including subsurface vacancies, which therefore play a crucial role in the process of vacancy cluster formation. These results have implications for our understanding of oxidation processes on reducible rare-earth oxides."
https://openalex.org/W1974750801,"In a forward screen for genes affecting neurotransmission in Drosophila, we identified mutations in dynamin-related protein (drp1). DRP1 is required for proper cellular distribution of mitochondria, and in mutant neurons, mitochondria are largely absent from synapses, thus providing a genetic tool to assess the role of mitochondria at synapses. Although resting Ca2+ is elevated at drp1 NMJs, basal synaptic properties are barely affected. However, during intense stimulation, mutants fail to maintain normal neurotransmission. Surprisingly, FM1-43 labeling indicates normal exo- and endocytosis, but a specific inability to mobilize reserve pool vesicles, which is partially rescued by exogenous ATP. Using a variety of drugs, we provide evidence that reserve pool recruitment depends on mitochondrial ATP production downstream of PKA signaling and that mitochondrial ATP limits myosin-propelled mobilization of reserve pool vesicles.

Our data suggest a specific role for mitochondria in regulating synaptic strength. Mitochondria are involved in multiple cellular processes, including ATP production, and Ca2+ homeostasis (Green and Kroemer, 2004Green D.R. Kroemer G.

The multitude of mitochondriopathies affecting the nervous system suggests important functions in neurons (Finsterer, 2004Finsterer J. Mitochondriopathies.Eur. J. Neurol. 2004; 11: 163-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Neuronal mitochondria are present in cell bodies and are abundant at synaptic terminals (Nguyen et al., 1997Nguyen P.V. Marin L. Atwood H.L. Synaptic physiology and mitochondrial function in crayfish tonic and phasic motor neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), where their mobility is regulated by activity (Yi et al., 2004Yi M. Weaver D. Hajnoczky G.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), suggesting an important role at synapses. Previous studies utilizing pharmacology to inhibit mitochondria revealed defects in synaptic potentiation and a failure to maintain neurotransmission under rigorous stimulation (Alnaes and Rahamimoff, 1975Alnaes E.

Physiol. 1994; 104: 337-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). While these findings suggest an involvement of mitochondria in neurotransmission, the precise involvement of these organelles in the regulation of the synaptic vesicle cycle remains poorly understood. In addition, drugs blocking mitochondrial function affect both cellular and synaptic mitochondria and have been documented to have nonmitochondrial effects (Jensen and Rehder, 1991Jensen J.R.

Budd S.L. Mitochondria and neuronal survival.Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 315-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). An alternative approach is to genetically manipulate mitochondrial transport to the synapse. Unfortunately, although mutants that block axonal transport can deplete synapses of mitochondria, they often also affect the distribution of other organelles, leading to pleiotropic defects (Collard et al., 1995Collard J.F. Cote F. Julien J.P. Defective axonal transport in a transgenic mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.Nature. 1995; 375: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, Hurd and Saxton, 1996Hurd D.D. Saxton W.M. Kinesin mutations cause motor neuron disease phenotypes by disrupting fast axonal transport in Drosophila.Genetics. 1996; 144: 1075-1085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, studies of milton (milt) mutants revealed specific defects in axonal transport of mitochondria in Drosophila (Stowers et al., 2002Stowers R.S. Megeath L.J. Gorska-Andrzejak J. Meinertzhagen I.A. Schwarz T.L. Axonal transport of mitochondria to synapses depends on milton, a novel Drosophila protein.Neuron. 2002; 36: 1063-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). However, a detailed functional analysis of milt synapses has not been reported. This is likely because the mutants die during early larval stages, precluding a detailed analysis at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a model synapse for the study of neurotransmission. To analyze the role of synaptic mitochondria, it would be ideal to block their synaptic localization without compromising their function in the soma. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of drp1 mutants. DRP1 is the fly homolog of dynamin-related protein, a protein implicated in fission of the outer mitochondrial membrane (reviewed in Praefcke and McMahon, 2004Praefcke G.J. McMahon H.T. The dynamin superfamily: universal membrane tubulation and fission molecules?.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar, Rube and van der Bliek, 2004Rube D.A. van der Bliek A.M. Mitochondrial morphology is dynamic and varied.Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 256–257: 331-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in Drosophila drp1 lead to dramatic defects in synaptic localization of mitochondria, but not in that of other organelles. The animals survive beyond the third instar larval stage and sometimes develop into adult flies. These and other data indicate that mitochondria in the cell bodies of the mutants are still functional. Hence, drp1 mutants allow us to assess the role of mitochondria in neurotransmission. Our data show that when drp1 synapses are stimulated at high frequency, they fail to maintain normal neurotransmission. Interestingly, this defect is not due to defects in exo- or endocytosis. Rather, our data indicate that lack of synaptic mitochondria results in a specific defect in mobilizing reserve pool (RP) vesicles. Furthermore, the addition of ATP partially rescues the observed defects. Similarly, application of drugs that target mitochondrial ATP production, but not Ca2+ buffering, block RP mobilization, suggesting that mitochondrial energy production is critical for RP mobilization. Using inhibitors of myosin light chain kinase, we provide evidence that ATP production by mitochondria is limiting to myosin-propelled vesicle mobilization from the RP, downstream of PKA-mediated mobilization of RP vesicles. Hence, our data suggest a regulatory role for mitochondria in the control of synaptic strength. We isolated two alleles of a complementation group that show defects in electroretinogram recordings when homozygous in the eye in a genetic screen for genes that affect neurotransmitter release (Koh et al., 2004Koh T.W.

Homozygous mutants are semilethal, and adult escaper flies are uncoordinated and show numerous neurological defects (Figure S1), hence the name fratboy (frat). To characterize the cause of the defects in frat, we performed electron microscopy on adult mutant photoreceptor (PR) synapses and found a dramatic reduction in synaptic mitochondria, but not in other organelles (Figure S2). Interestingly, mitochondria cluster in the cell bodies of mutant photoreceptors (Figure S2). Hence, frat mutants provide us with an opportunity to study the role of mitochondria at synapses. We mapped the molecular lesions in the frat alleles (drp11 and drp12) as well as two additional lethal alleles l(2)22FdT26 and l(2)22FcH7 (Littleton and Bellen, 1994Littleton J.T. Bellen H.J. Genetic and phenotypic analysis of thirteen essential genes in cytological interval 22F1–2; 23B1–2 reveals novel genes required for neural development in Drosophila.Genetics. 1994; 138: 111-123PubMed Google Scholar) that fail to complement drp11 and drp12 to CG3210, also called drp1, noodle, or dynamin-2 in Flybase (Figure S3). All of these alleles fail to complement the deficiency Df(2L)Exel6008 (Parks et al., 2004Parks A.L. Cook K.R. Belvin M. Dompe N.A. Fawcett R. Huppert K. Tan L.R. Winter C.G. Bogart K.P. Deal J.E. et al.Systematic generation of high-resolution deletion coverage of the Drosophila melanogaster genome.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) that spans the region, as well as a lethal P-element KG03815 in CG3210 (Bellen et al., 2004Bellen H.J. Levis R.W. Liao G. He Y. Carlson J.W. Tsang G. Evans-Holm M. Hiesinger P.R. Schulze K.L. Rubin G.M. et al.The BDGP gene disruption project: single transposon insertions associated with 40% of Drosophila genes.Genetics. 2004; 167: 761-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Hence, frat corresponds to CG3210 or drp1, and we renamed frat1 as drp11; frat2 as drp12; l(2)22FdT26 as drp1T26; l(2)22FcH7 as drp1H7 and KG03815 as drp1KG. To assess whether the lesions in drp1 are responsible for the observed phenotypes, a 9.35 kb genomic rescue construct was crossed into drp1 mutants (see Experimental Procedures and Figure S3). The lethality and phenotypes of drp12 and drp11/drp12 are rescued by this construct, as well as by a genomic construct that harbors an in-frame FLAG-FlAsH-HA tag after the start codon of CG3210 (Figure S3). Using this construct we also demonstrate that Drosophila DRP1 is enriched on mitochondria, similar to drp1/dlp/dnm1 in other species (Figure S4). Collectively, these data indicate that Drosophila drp1 is an ortholog of drp1/dlp/dnm1 (Labrousse et al., 1999Labrousse A.M. Zappaterra M.D. Rube D.A. van der Bliek A.M.

Our initial analyses of drp1 (frat) mutants showed clusters of mitochondria in PR soma, but not in synapses. To determine if the clustered mitochondria in drp1 mutants function properly, we labeled them with rhodamine-123 (Rh123). Rh123 is a cell-permeable dye that localizes to the mitochondrial lumen when the inner membrane is hyperpolarized (Johnson et al., 1980Johnson L.V. Walsh M.L. Chen L.B. Localization of mitochondria in living cells with rhodamine 123.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1980; 77: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 1A , Rh123 fluorescence in control salivary glands is bright and concentrated, resembling MitoGFP, a mitochondrial marker (W. Saxton, unpublished data) (Figure 1D). When we abolish the mitochondrial membrane potential with 20 μm azide, Rh123 diffuses (Figure 1B), suggesting that Rh123 only localizes to active mitochondria. In drp1 mutants, Rh123 fluorescence appears in large perinuclear blobs (Figure 1C), similar to MitoGFP (Figures 1E and 1F), but the Rh123 signal in drp1 mutants is bright, as in controls (compare Figures 1A–1C). To quantify mitochondrial function in drp12 more precisely, we used JC-1, a dye that exhibits potential-dependent accumulation in mitochondria, as is indicated by a shift in emission from green to red light (Reers et al., 1991Reers M. Smith T.W. Chen L.B. J-aggregate formation of a carbocyanine as a quantitative fluorescent indicator of membrane potential.Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4480-4486Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Consequently, the ratio of red to green fluorescence intensity is a measure of the mitochondrial potential. Whereas this ratio is low in controls treated with azide (0.53 ± 0.04), the mitochondria in drp1 mutants hold a negative membrane potential that is similar to that in controls (JC-1 ratio in control: 0.90 ± 0.09; drp12: 0.91 ± 0.03). Hence, these data indicate that, despite their altered distribution, the clustered mitochondria in drp12 are functional. To determine mitochondrial distribution in drp1 mutant motor neurons, we expressed MitoGFP. In the ventral nerve cord of control larvae, MitoGFP mostly localizes to motor neuron projections in the neuropil (NP) (Figure 1G). Strikingly, drp1 mutants show reduced levels of mitochondria in the NP and clumps in the motor neuron somas (CB) bordering the ventral nerve cord (Figure 1H). In control motor neurons, MitoGFP also labels numerous mitochondria in axons that innervate proximal (Figure 1I1) and distal (Figure 1I2) NMJs. In the axons of drp12 mutants, fewer MitoGFP-marked mitochondria are observed (Figures 1J1 and 1J2) and they form long threads (arrows) rarely observed in controls. These data indicate that loss of DRP1 function leads to clustering of mitochondria in the cell body and suggest a defect in axonal mitochondrial transport. To measure the presence of mitochondria at NMJs, we quantified MitoGFP labeling in boutons demarcated by anti-DLG labeling. While controls contain several mitochondria per bouton, drp1 boutons contain few and small mitochondria (Figures 1K–1N), and this is further confirmed by Rh123 labeling of control drp12 or drp1/drp2 NMJs (data not shown). In addition, we also measured the mitochondrial volume in a 3-D data stack and compared it to the synaptic volume (Figures 1O–1R). While mitochondria occupy about 10% of the bouton volume in controls, this is significantly less in drp12 or drp11/drp12 mutants (Figure 1R). This difference does not seem to be exacerbated by severe morphological defects of drp1 NMJs, as bouton number per muscle area (controls: 1.0 ± 0.1 μm−2; drp12: 1.2 ± 0.1 μm−2) and synapse length per muscle area (controls: 6.2 ± 2.6 μm−1; drp12: 6.2 ± 0.7 μm−1) are not different from those in controls (p = n. s.). Only NMJ branching is slightly increased in drp12 (controls: 8.3 ± 1.3/NMJ; drp12: 13.8 ± 0.9/NMJ; p < 0.05). The defect in synaptic localization is probably confined to mitochondria, as synaptotagmin (Littleton et al., 1993Littleton J.T. Stern M. Schulze K. Perin M. Bellen H.J. Mutational analysis of Drosophila synaptotagmin demonstrates its essential role in Ca(2+)-activated neurotransmitter release.Cell. 1993; 74: 1125-1134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), a synaptic vesicle marker, and endophilin (Verstreken et al., 2002Verstreken P. Kjaerulff O. Lloyd T.E. Atkinson R. Zhou Y. Meinertzhagen I.A. Bellen H.J. Endophilin mutations block clathrin-mediated endocytosis but not neurotransmitter release.Cell. 2002; 109: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), a member of the endocytic machinery, are localized correctly at the synapse (data not shown). These data indicate that loss of Drp1 function leads to defects in mitochondrial localization, leaving most drp1 synapses, including NMJs, with many fewer mitochondria than controls. As mitochondria have been implicated in Ca2+ buffering, we determined the intracellular resting Ca2+ levels by forward-filling controls and drp12 mutants with the ratiometric Ca2+ indicator Fura-2 Dextran (Macleod et al., 2002Macleod G.T. Hegstrom-Wojtowicz M. Charlton M.P. Atwood H.L. Fast calcium signals in Drosophila motor neuron terminals.J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 88: 2659-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We find that the intracellular resting Ca2+ in drp12 mutant boutons is about 2-fold higher than the level in controls (Figure 2A ; control: 92.5 ± 17.8 nM; drp12: 169.6 ± 33.0 nM; p < 0.05). Hence, synaptic mitochondria are required to maintain resting Ca2+ levels. We then determined if drp1 affects basal neurotransmitter release by recording excitatory junctional potentials (EJPs). When stimulated at 1 Hz in either 0.6 mM, 1 mM, 1.5 mM, or 5 mM Ca2+, loss of DRP1 function does not lead to a defect in transmitter release, even when stressed at 36°C in 5 mM Ca2+ (Figure 2B). We also recorded paired EJPs at 20 ms, 40 ms, 60 ms, or 100 ms interpulse intervals, but did not observe any difference in paired pulse ratio of recordings made at 0.6 or 1.5 mM Ca2+ (data not shown). Only at low extracellular Ca2+ (0.25 mM) did we observe a significant increase in EJP amplitude of drp12 compared to controls (Figure 2B; controls: 4.8 ± 0.6 mV and drp12: 8.5 ± 1.5 mV; p < 0.05). In addition, at 0.25 mM Ca2+, controls fail to evoke EJPs in 20% of the stimulations, whereas drp12 animals only failed 4% of the time (Figure 2C). Finally, we recorded spontaneous release events (mEJPs) in 0.5 mM Ca2+ and TTX in controls and drp1 mutants and analyzed events larger than 0.4 mV, but did not find a difference in amplitude distribution, average amplitude, or frequency (Figure S5). Hence, despite a dramatic reduction of synaptic mitochondria and a near doubling of the resting intracellular Ca2+ in drp1 mutants, the basal release properties of the NMJs at physiological Ca2+ concentrations are not significantly altered. To determine whether drp1 mutants display alterations in regulating intracellular Ca2+ levels during stimulation, we forward-filled control and drp12 NMJs with the Ca2+ indicator Oregon Green BAPTA-1 Dextran (OGB) (Macleod et al., 2002Macleod G.T. Hegstrom-Wojtowicz M. Charlton M.P. Atwood H.L. Fast calcium signals in Drosophila motor neuron terminals.J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 88: 2659-2663Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Fluorescence in control NMJs stimulated at 10 Hz for 4 min initially increases and then plateaus, indicating an accumulation of Ca2+ during stimulation (Figures 2D1, 2D2, and 2E). After stimulation, OGB fluorescence quickly declines to a level close to baseline in less than 10 s (Figures 2D3 and 2E). Fluorescence in drp12 mutants does not plateau, but increases throughout the stimulation period (Figures 2D5 and 2E). After stimulation, fluorescence in mutants remains high and only slowly declines (Figures 2D6 and 2E). We found very similar results using a membrane-permeable Ca2+ indicator Fluo-4 AM (Figure 2F). Note, however, that after brief stimulation (<30 s), Ca2+-indicator fluorescence in drp1 mutants is not dramatically different from that in controls (Figures 2E and 2F, arrow). This suggests that mitochondria are not required to keep pace with the Ca2+ influx during a 30 s 10 Hz stimulation paradigm. To investigate drp1 mutant NMJs during intense neuronal activity, we recorded EJPs at 10 Hz stimulation. As shown in Figure 3, the EJP amplitude in drp12 steadily decreases, indicating that drp12 mutants cannot maintain release like controls can. As drp1 adult escapers show temperature-sensitive paralysis (Figure S1), we also assessed neurotransmission during a 10 Hz train at 36°C. Interestingly, after 10 min of 10 Hz stimulation at 36°C, drp12 mutants as well as drp11/drp12 transheterozygotes run down to about 40% of the original response (Figure 3A, circles and data not shown). Hence, during intense stimulation, neurotransmission in drp1 progressively declines. Mitochondria play a metabolic role by generating more than 90% of the cellular ATP (Mathews and Van Holde, 1996Mathews C.K. Van Holde K.E. Biochemistry.Second Edition. The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Menlo Park, CA1996Google Scholar). To test whether ATP can rescue the defect in neurotransmission during 10 Hz stimulation in drp1 mutants, we performed rescue experiments with ATP. Although purinergic receptors are not present in the Drosophila genome, we determined whether ATP affects neurotransmitter release of controls. We forward-filled motor nerve terminals of controls with 1 mM ATP (see Experimental Procedures) and recorded EJPs and mEJPs. The EJP amplitudes at 1 and 5 mM Ca2+, as well as the mEJPs from controls with and without ATP, are indistinguishable (Figure S6), indicating that 1 mM ATP does not alter release characteristics at the Drosophila NMJ. We next forward-filled control and drp12 mutant motor neurons with 1 mM ATP and recorded EJPs during 10 Hz stimulation. Although controls with and without ATP show no difference during the 10 Hz train, drp12 mutants maintain release better when ATP is added (Figure 3B, open squares). These data suggest that loss of DRP1 leads to a defect in regaining fusion-competent vesicles, in part due to ATP depletion. The progressive reduction in neurotransmission during intense stimulation may be caused by an endocytic defect. To study endocytosis, we used FM1-43, a dye that reversibly binds membranes and is internalized into vesicles forming from the presynaptic membrane. Nerve stimulation at 3 Hz or 60 mM K+ in the presence of FM1-43 and 1.5 mM Ca2+ labels synaptic boutons in controls and in drp12 mutants (Figures 4A–4C ). Furthermore, drp1 mutants maintain neurotransmitter release during 3 Hz stimulation, similar to controls (Figure S7). Hence, vesicle endocytosis during mild stimulation is normal in drp1 mutants. As the EJP amplitude in drp1 mutants is normal initially, but declines during high-frequency stimulation, it is possible that endocytosis is affected only after synapses are stimulated at 10 Hz for an extended period. Controls and drp1 mutants were therefore stimulated at 10 Hz for 10.5 min (5 mM Ca2+), and FM1-43 was added during the last 0.5 min of stimulation. As shown in Figure 4D (1 and 2, load) and Figure 4E, (loading) controls and drp1 mutants internalize similar amounts of dye in the 30 s labeling period, indicating that even after intense synaptic activity, vesicle endocytosis is not impaired in drp1 mutants. At least two functionally distinct vesicle pools, the exo-endo cycling pool (ECP) and the reserve pool (RP), exist at the third instar NMJ, and defects in vesicle mobilization from either pool affect neurotransmission (Kidokoro et al., 2004Kidokoro Y. Kuromi H. Delgado R. Maureira C. Oliva C. Labarca P. Synaptic vesicle pools and plasticity of synaptic transmission at the Drosophila synapse.Brain Res. Brain Res.

Betz W.J. Synaptic vesicle pools.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 6: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Endocytosis of new vesicles into the ECP occurs mostly during stimulation, while the RP primarily refills following stimulation (Kuromi and Kidokoro, 2002Kuromi H. Kidokoro Y. Selective replenishment of two vesicle pools depends on the source of Ca2+ at the Drosophila synapse.Neuron. 2002; 35: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, since FM1-43 loading during stimulation (3 Hz or 10 Hz) is not impaired in drp1 mutants (Figures 4A–4E), our data indicate that drp1 does not affect uptake of vesicles into the ECP. To test whether ECP vesicle exocytosis is affected by intense stimulation in drp1 mutants, we determined the unloading rate of ECP vesicles labeled with FM1-43 upon stimulation. We first loaded ECP vesicles in controls and drp12 mutants with FM1-43 during the last 0.5 min of a 10.5 min 10 Hz train (Figures 4D1 and 4D2). We then quickly washed the preparations with zero Ca2+ HL-3, to remove noninternalized dye (<5 min), and stimulated them using 90 mM K+ to mobilize the loaded ECP vesicles. Interestingly, bouton fluorescence after 1 min or 10 min of unloading was similar in controls and in drp1 mutants (Figures 4D3, 4D4, and 4E), indicating that endocytosis as well as exocytosis of ECP vesicles is not disrupted in stimulated drp1 mutants. Next, we determined whether exo- and endocytosis of RP vesicles is affected in drp1 mutants by applying a protocol that loads the ECP as well as the RP with FM1-43 at NMJ synapses. It is important to note that RP vesicles do not participate much in exocytosis during mild stimulation (<3 Hz) or K+ stimulation (Kuromi and Kidokoro, 2002Kuromi H. Kidokoro Y. Selective replenishment of two vesicle pools depends on the source of Ca2+ at the Drosophila synapse.Neuron. 2002; 35: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), but only during intense stimulation (≥10 Hz). Hence, to mobilize and exocytose RP vesicles, we stimulated controls and drp12 mutants at 10 Hz for 10 min (5 mM Ca2+). Since the RP vesicles will primarily refill after intense stimulation is terminated, while the ECP will mainly load during stimulation, we added FM1-43 during the 10 Hz train and at 5 min after stimulation (10 Hz, 10 min + 5 min protocol [adapted from Kuromi and Kidokoro, 2002Kuromi H. Kidokoro Y. Selective replenishment of two vesicle pools depends on the source of Ca2+ at the Drosophila synapse.Neuron. 2002; 35: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar]; Figure 5A ). Using this protocol, control boutons are extensively loaded with dye. In contrast, drp12 mutants take up less dye (Figures 5B1, 5B2, and 5C). To subsequently visualize labeled RP vesicles, we unloaded the ECP using K+ (1.5 mM Ca2+) for 5 min (Figure 5A). As shown in Figure 5B3, portions of control type Ib boutons remained labeled with dye, in agreement with previous observations (Kuromi and Kidokoro, 2000Kuromi H. Kidokoro Y.

Kidokoro Y. Selective replenishment of two vesicle pools depends on the source of Ca2+ at the Drosophila synapse.Neuron. 2002; 35: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, drp12 or drp11/drp12 mutant boutons did not retain much labeling (Figures 5B4 and 5C; data not shown). This defect is specific to mutants, as drp12 animals with a rescue construct show normal RP loading (data not shown). Hence, these data suggest a defect in cycling of RP vesicles at drp1 synapses, possibly due to a defect in mobilization of (old) unlabeled RP vesicles or a defect in RP formation. To further distinguish whether Ca2+ sequestration or ATP production by mitochondria is important for RP vesicle cycling, we applied various drugs for 20 min to wild-type NMJs and then repeated the 10Hz 10 min + 5 min loading-ECP unloading protocol (Figure 5A) in the presence of the drug (Figures 5D and 5E). First we applied 5 μg/ml antimycin, an inhibitor of the electron transport chain that disrupts mitochondrial ATP production and Ca2+ sequestration (Budd and Nicholls, 1996Budd S.L. Nicholls D.G.

We found that, during periods of recurrent network activity (UP states), cortical pyramidal cells in vivo and in vitro receive strong barrages of both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, with the inhibitory potentials showing much higher power at all frequencies above approximately 10 Hz and more synchrony between nearby neurons. Fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons discharged strongly in relation to higher-frequency oscillations in the field potential in vivo and possess membrane, synaptic, and action potential properties that are advantageous for transmission of higher-frequency activity. Intracellular injection of synaptic conductances having the characteristics of the recorded EPSPs and IPSPs reveal that IPSPs are important in controlling the timing and probability of action potential generation in pyramidal cells. Our results support the hypothesis that inhibitory networks are largely responsible for the dissemination of higher-frequency activity in cortex.

The encoding of information in cortical networks depends not only upon the rate at which action potentials are generated by individual cells, but also on the temporal precision and the relative timing of action potentials between neurons in an interacting network (Foffani et al., 2004Foffani G.

Of particular interest is the generation of gamma band (30–80 Hz) activity, since this is often associated with an activated cortical network. In vivo and in vitro recordings in the hippocampus indicate that the discharge of inhibitory neurons plays a key role in higher-frequency network activities (Csicsvari et al., 2003Csicsvari J.

In the neocortex, it has been proposed that a specialized subgroup of pyramidal cells, chattering neurons (Cunningham et al., 2004Cunningham M.O. Whittington M.A. Bibbig A. Roopun A. LeBeau F.E.

Chattering cells: superficial pyramidal neurons contributing to the generation of synchronous oscillations in the visual cortex.Science. 1996; 274: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), are critically involved in the generation of gamma frequency network oscillations, although in vitro results suggest an important role for inhibitory neurons in this, and lower-frequency, synchronized activities (Deans et al., 2001Deans M.R.

Neurophysiol. 2005; 93: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). An important role for inhibition in precise spike timing and higher-frequency activity is suggested by a standard feature of cortical networks: excitatory afferents typically contact not only pyramidal cells, but also GABAergic neurons, resulting in monosynaptic excitation followed after a short interval by disynaptic inhibition in the recipient pyramidal cell, effectively “sharpening” the characteristics of synaptic inputs (Pouille and Scanziani, 2001Pouille F.

Balanced inhibition underlies tuning and sharpens spike timing in auditory cortex.Nature. 2003; 426: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Fast-spiking (FS) GABAergic neurons such as basket cells innervate the cell body and proximal dendrites of pyramidal cells, while chandelier cells innervate the axon initial segment of pyramidal cells; both are preferred locations for controlling the timing and probability of action potential generation in pyramidal cells (Cobb et al., 1995Cobb S.R.

Here, using the spontaneously occurring recurrent network activity in vivo and in vitro of the so-called UP and DOWN states, we demonstrate that inhibitory synaptic potentials carry the large majority of power in the frequency range of 10–100 Hz and indeed often synchronously inhibit nearby pyramidal cells. These results support the hypothesis that GABAergic interneurons are critical in determining temporal coding and spike timing precision in cortical networks. Intracellular, extracellular multiple-unit, and field potential recordings in the dorsal prefrontal cortex of either ketamine/xylazine-anesthetized ferrets or in layer 5 of a ferret prefrontal cortical slice maintained in vitro exhibited robust and spontaneous UP and DOWN states (Figure 1A ). The UP state is characterized by the arrival of large barrages of postsynaptic potentials, which depolarize the neuron by 5–25 mV in vivo (n = 30 cells) and 5–15 mV in vitro (n = 55 cells). The UP state causes regular-spiking (RS) cells to discharge at approximately 3–30 Hz, both in vivo and in vitro (Figure 1A). In between UP states, the membrane potential is relatively hyperpolarized, and there is a marked decrease in synaptic activity (Cowan and Wilson, 1994Cowan R.L. Wilson C.J.

Timofeev I. Grenier F. Natural waking and sleep states: a view from inside neocortical neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2001; 85: 1969-1985PubMed Google Scholar). The UP state is generated through local recurrent excitation that is balanced and controlled by the activity of GABAergic interneurons (Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 2000Sanchez-Vives M.V. McCormick D.A. Cellular and network mechanisms of rhythmic recurrent activity in neocortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar, Shu et al., 2003bShu Y. Hasenstaub A. McCormick D.A. Turning on and off recurrent balanced cortical activity.Nature. 2003; 423: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). To examine the properties of the synaptic inputs arriving in the UP state, we moved the membrane potential to different levels with either the intracellular injection of direct current (current-clamp mode) or through the application of single-electrode voltage clamp, both in vivo and in vitro (Figure 1B). To examine the properties of incoming synaptic currents, we typically included 50 mM QX-314 and 2 M CsAc in our sharp intracellular pipettes to reduce Na+, K+, and other intrinsic currents. The results obtained either in anesthetized ferrets or in slices in vitro were similar (except where stated). We have previously reported that the synaptic activity arriving in cortical pyramidal cells during the UP state in vitro is a proportional mixture of excitatory and inhibitory potentials that exhibits a net reversal potential of between −20 and −40 mV (Shu et al., 2003bShu Y. Hasenstaub A. McCormick D.A. Turning on and off recurrent balanced cortical activity.Nature. 2003; 423: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Examination of the synaptic potentials or synaptic currents arriving in these cells, either at membrane potentials near the reversal potential of the synaptic barrages (−20 to −40 mV), or at membrane potentials near those of the UP state (−55 to −60 mV), revealed a broad range of frequencies in the power spectrum (Figure 1B; n = 6). The block of GABAA receptors with local application of picrotoxin (50 μM in micropipette) rapidly resulted in an elevation of power at low (<10 Hz) frequencies and greatly reduced power at higher frequencies (Figures 1C–1E; n = 6), well before the appearance of epileptiform activity (Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 2000Sanchez-Vives M.V. McCormick D.A. Cellular and network mechanisms of rhythmic recurrent activity in neocortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1027-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). This result indicates that the proper functioning of GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory systems in the neocortex is required for the generation of higher frequencies in network-driven synaptic barrages. A general block of inhibition results in large changes in network behavior, eventually leading to the generation of epileptiform activity. To isolate the properties of excitatory or inhibitory synaptic inputs without affecting network activity, we controlled the membrane potential of the recorded cell through the intracellular injection of current (either in current or voltage clamp) such that the UP state occurred either at the reversal potential of EPSCs (0 mV; to examine IPSCs in relative isolation) or at the reversal potential for IPSCs (−75 to −80 mV; to examine EPSCs) (see Figure 2). Although these synaptic barrages will not be purely excitatory or inhibitory (due to incomplete voltage or space clamp, for example), at these membrane potentials they will be dominated by one or the other (Shu et al., 2003bShu Y. Hasenstaub A. McCormick D.A. Turning on and off recurrent balanced cortical activity.Nature. 2003; 423: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Results obtained in vivo or in vitro were similar unless otherwise stated. During the UP state, synaptic barrages dominated by excitation (recorded near −80 mV) exhibited smoother membrane potential deflections than did synaptic barrages dominated by inhibition (recorded near 0 mV) (Figure 2A; n = 10 in vivo; n = 6 in vitro). Examination of power versus frequency for segments of UP states recorded at 0 and −80 mV revealed that both IPSP/C and EPSP/C barrages exhibited a progressive decrease in power with increase in frequency, although the power in the IPSP/C barrages was significantly higher than that in the EPSP/C barrages in the frequency range of 2 to 102 Hz (Figure 2B). Often, particularly for in vivo recordings, the IPSP/IPSC barrages exhibited more power at the 30–80 Hz (gamma frequency) range than would be expected, given the steady falloff of power with frequency (Figure 2B). Excitatory PSPs/PSCs either exhibited a smaller (n = 5/10) or no evident (n = 5/10) enhancement of gamma frequency power. In individual cells (e.g., Figures 2C and 2D), plots of the ratio of power in IPSP/Cs versus EPSP/Cs arriving in the same neurons during UP states often revealed a progressive increase between the frequencies of approximately 1–10 Hz followed by a progressive decrease above approximately 60–80 Hz. In between 10 and 80 Hz, the ratio typically exhibited one or two and sometimes three peaks at frequencies between 20 and approximately 70 Hz (Figure 2C). Although the precise location of these peaks varied between recorded cells, group averages of the normalized ratio of power in IPSPs versus EPSPs revealed a gradual increase and decrease, with the peak ratio centered around 40 Hz (Figure 2D). At this peak, there was 14.5 ± 9 times as much power in the IPSPs as EPSPs, while at 2 Hz the ratio was 5.2 ± 1.8, and at 200 Hz it dropped to 2.9 ± 1.5. We hypothesized that FS neurons, a major GABAergic cell type in the cortex (Kawaguchi, 1995Kawaguchi Y.

Neurosci. 1995; 15: 2638-2655PubMed Google Scholar, McCormick et al., 1985McCormick D.A. Connors B.W. Lighthall J.W. Prince D.A.

Neurophysiol. 2003; 89: 1541-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), may possess specific membrane and synaptic properties that allow them to convey a broad frequency range of activity in cortical networks. Indeed, the barrages of PSPs arriving in FS GABAergic cells in vitro at −70 to −60 mV during the UP state appeared to be dominated by briefer and “sharper” events than those arriving in RS pyramidal neurons (Figure 3; n = 21 RS cells; n = 11 FS cells). Examination of the power spectra of the PSP barrages revealed that FS cells have progressively more power than RS cells at frequencies above approximately 25–30 Hz (see Figures 3E and 3F; n = 8 RS; n = 7 FS cells). Part of these differences may be the result of the shorter membrane time constant of FS cells in comparison to RS neurons, resulting in less attenuation of higher frequencies in FS neurons (sharp electrodes and fit with a single exponential function; FS cells: 4.3 ± 1.2 ms, n = 8; RS cells: 14.7 ± 7.2 ms, n = 13) (McCormick et al., 1985McCormick D.A.

To test this hypothesis, we injected, through a dynamic-clamp system (Shu et al., 2003aShu Y. Hasenstaub A. Badoual M. Bal T. McCormick D.A. Barrages of synaptic activity control the gain and sensitivity of cortical neurons.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10388-10401PubMed Google Scholar), colored conductance noise while recording from physiologically identified FS and RS neurons with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique in vitro (see Experimental Procedures) and examined the resulting deviation in membrane potential (Figures 4A–4C ; n = 21 RS cells; n = 11 FS cells; membrane time constants for the two cell types in whole-cell recordings were 28.4 ± 12.2 and 12.0 ± 4.8, respectively). The calculation of the power transfer between conductance injected and voltage fluctuations revealed that, although both cell types exhibited a decrease in membrane potential deviation with increase in frequency, this decrease was greater for RS than FS cells above approximately 12 Hz (Figure 4C). Likewise, examining the representation of different frequencies in the action potential output of cortical cells in response to the intracellular injection of colored noise (see Experimental Procedures) revealed that RS neurons (n = 16) showed resonance at 5 to 10 Hz and attenuation at higher frequencies, while FS neurons (n = 8) showed greater representation of inputs at frequencies above 15 Hz (Figure 4F). Interestingly, in many FS interneurons (n = 6/8) the transfer of frequencies in the spike train peaked near gamma frequencies, 30–80 Hz (Figure 4F).Figure 4FS GABAergic Neurons, Compared to RS Principal Neurons, Exhibit Membrane Properties that Cause Less High-Frequency AttenuationShow full captionExamples of the membrane response of a pyramidal cell (A) and a FS GABAergic cell (B) to the injection of conductance noise.

Measuring the spike refractory period for FS neurons revealed that it lasted, on average, only 32 ± 12 ms (see the Supplemental Data available with this article online; n = 8), which is significantly shorter than that found in RS pyramidal cells in vitro (90 ± 8.9 ms; n = 11; p < 0.001) (Shu et al., 2003aShu Y. Hasenstaub A. Badoual M. Bal T. McCormick D.A. Barrages of synaptic activity control the gain and sensitivity of cortical neurons.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10388-10401PubMed Google Scholar). This difference in spike refractory periods presumably contributes strongly to the preferred firing frequency of these two types of neurons in response to noise injection (see Supplemental Data). To test the hypothesis that inhibitory neurons in the neocortex play an important role in the generation of higher-frequency activities in local networks, we recorded extracellularly from single neurons in the ferret prefrontal cortex in vivo, identified these cells as either RS or FS (see Experimental Procedures and Supplemental Data), and correlated their activity with the gamma band oscillations of the local field potential recorded from the same electrode (Figure 5). Extracellular recordings revealed FS cells (n = 7) to discharge strongly (mean rate of 10–35 Hz; see Supplemental Data) during UP states (Figure 5B and Figure S4), while RS cells discharged at a lower mean rate of 0.5 to 15 Hz (Figure 5A; see Supplemental Data). Filtering the field potential for gamma frequencies (30–80 Hz) isolated the prominent gamma oscillation in the local field potential (mean frequency of 44–68 Hz; n = 22 recordings). Plotting a perievent histogram of FS and RS cell discharge synchronized on the trough of the gamma field potential oscillation revealed a strong relationship between the probability of discharge in both FS and RS cells and the phase of the gamma oscillation in the local field potential (Figures 5E and 5F). RS activity peaked at a phase of −0.26 cycles (±0.14; n = 14; 0 = gamma trough, 0.5 = gamma peak), while FS interneurons discharged on average at a phase of −0.03 (±0.17; Figure 5G), indicating that RS cells on average lead FS cell discharge by 4.1 ms (FS cells fire at −1.0 ± 3.0 ms; RS cells fire at −5.1 ± 2.4 ms; p < 0.01). Simultaneous extracellular field potential and nearby (within 0.8 mm) intracellular recordings from RS cells (n = 9) were performed while the membrane potential of the RS cells was depolarized and hyperpolarized to various levels with the intracellular injection of current (Figures 6A–6D ; QX-314 and Cs+ included in the micropipette). Filtering the field potential for 30–80 Hz activity, and then performing a field potential trough-triggered average of the intracellularly recorded membrane potential at either near −80 mV or 0 mV (Figures 6E and 6F) revealed that both excitation-dominated barrages and inhibition-dominated barrages are modulated in relation to gamma oscillations in the local field; however, inhibition-dominated barrages are more strongly modulated (mean peak-to-trough height 1.8 ± 0.8 mV, compared to 0.9 ± 0.4 mV for excitation-dominated barrages; mean difference of 0.8 ± 0.6 mV; p < 0.05, Wilcoxon sign rank test). To examine the possibility that inhibitory potentials may exhibit a higher degree of synchrony than excitatory potentials during the UP state, we intracellularly recorded (sharp electrodes) simultaneously from pairs of nearby RS pyramidal neurons in vitro (within 100 μm) and in vivo (pairs within 1.2 mm; see Supplemental Data). In vitro (Figures 7A, 7C, and 7D ), the inhibition-dominated barrages recorded simultaneously from neighboring cells (both held near 0 mV) showed a higher cross-correlation during the UP state than did the excitation-dominated barrages (both cells held near −75 mV) in the same cells (n = 7 pairs; only UP states were used for the cross-correlation). Cross-correlations between UP states recorded in the same neuron pairs, but randomly shuffled, did not reveal similar correlations (Figures 7C a"
https://openalex.org/W2066575706,"We have identified EMS-induced mutations in Drosophila Miro (dMiro), an atypical mitochondrial GTPase that is orthologous to human Miro (hMiro). Mutant dmiro animals exhibit defects in locomotion and die prematurely. Mitochondria in dmiro mutant muscles and neurons are abnormally distributed. Instead of being transported into axons and dendrites, mitochondria accumulate in parallel rows in neuronal somata. Mutant neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) lack presynaptic mitochondria, but neurotransmitter release and acute Ca2+ buffering is only impaired during prolonged stimulation. Neuronal, but not muscular, expression of dMiro in dmiro mutants restored viability, transport of mitochondria to NMJs, the structure of synaptic boutons, the organization of presynaptic microtubules, and the size of postsynaptic muscles. In addition, gain of dMiro function causes an abnormal accumulation of mitochondria in distal synaptic boutons of NMJs. Together, our findings suggest that dMiro is required for controlling anterograde transport of mitochondria and their proper distribution within nerve terminals."

https://openalex.org/W2166044596,"<h2>Summary</h2> In the auditory cortex, brief sounds elicit a powerful suppression of responsiveness that can persist for hundreds of milliseconds. This forward suppression (sometimes also called forward masking) has usually been attributed to synaptic (GABAergic) inhibition. Here we have used whole-cell recordings in vivo to assess the role of synaptic inhibition in forward suppression in auditory cortex. We measured the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances elicited by pairs of brief sounds presented at intervals from tens to hundreds of milliseconds. We find that inhibitory conductances rarely last longer than 50–100 ms, whereas spike responses and synaptic inputs remain suppressed for hundreds of milliseconds. We conclude that postsynaptic inhibition contributes to forward suppression for only the first 50–100 ms after a stimulus and that intracortical contributions to long-lasting suppression must involve other mechanisms, such as synaptic depression."

Purkinje cells of these mice show elongated spines and enhanced LTD induction at the parallel fiber synapses that innervate these spines. Moreover, Fragile X patients display the same cerebellar deficits in eye-blink conditioning as the mutant mice. These data indicate that a lack of FMRP leads to cerebellar deficits at both the cellular and behavioral levels and raise the possibility that cerebellar dysfunctions can contribute to motor learning deficits in Fragile X patients."

We assessed whether this bias in fear conditioning extends to social groups defined by race.

Transfer of the receptor from ABP/GRIP to PICK1, facilitated by GluR2 S880 phosphorylation, may initiate receptor trafficking. Here we report protein interactions that regulate these steps. The PICK1 BAR domain interacts intermolecularly with the ABP/GRIP linker II region and intramolecularly with the PICK1 PDZ domain. Binding of PKCalpha or GluR2 to the PICK1 PDZ domain disrupts the intramolecular interaction and facilitates the PICK1 BAR domain association with ABP/GRIP. Interference with the PICK1-ABP/GRIP interaction impairs S880 phosphorylation of GluR2 by PKC and decreases the constitutive surface expression of GluR2, the NMDA-induced endocytosis of GluR2, and recycling of internalized GluR2.

https://openalex.org/W2108506459,"Neuropsychological case studies suggest the existence of two functionally separate visual streams: the ventral pathway, central for object recognition; and the dorsal pathway, engaged in visually guided actions. However, a clear dissociation between the functions of the two streams has not been decisively shown in intact humans. In this study, we demonstrate dissociation between dorsal and ventral fMRI activation patterns during observation of object manipulation video clips. Parietal areas, such as anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS) display grasp viewing-dependent adaptation (i.e., fMR adaptation during repeated viewing of the same object-grasping movement) as well as a contralateral preference for the viewed manipulating hand. Ventral regions, such as the fusiform gyrus, show similar characteristics (i.e., adaptation, contralateral preference), but these depend on object identity. Our results support the hypothesized functional specialization in the visual system and suggest that parietal areas (such as aIPS) are engaged in action recognition, as well as in action planning.

Our results support the hypothesized functional specialization in the visual system and suggest that parietal areas (such as aIPS) are engaged in action recognition, as well as in action planning. One of the most influential concepts in understanding biological vision is the division of labor between the two major visual pathways (Mishkin and Ungerleider, 1982Mishkin M. Ungerleider L.G. Contribution of striate inputs to the visuospatial functions of parieto-preoccipital cortex in monkeys.Behav. Brain Res. 1982; 6: 57-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, Livingstone and Hubel, 1988Livingstone M. Hubel D.

Separate visual pathways for perception and action.Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 20-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3924) Google Scholar). It is commonly thought that areas in the ventral pathway, extending from the striate cortex to the inferotemporal cortex, play a major role in object recognition, while the dorsal pathway regions are supposedly engaged in sensorimotor transformation necessary for visually guided actions (Goodale and Milner, 1992Goodale M.A. Milner D. Separate visual pathways for perception and action.Trends Neurosci. 1992; 15: 20-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3924) Google Scholar). This concept is supported by neuropsychological case studies showing that damage to the ventrolateral part of the occipitotemporal cortex results in agnosia, a severe impairment in the perception of objects, while the ability to accurately grasp the same unidentified objects remains intact (James et al., 2003James T.W. Culham J. Humphrey G.K. Milner A.D. Goodale M.A. Ventral occipital lesions impair object recognition but not object-directed grasping: an fMRI study.Brain. 2003; 126: 2463-2475Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Individuals with damage in the superior part of the parietal cortex show the opposite behavior, termed optic ataxia: they are often unable to use visual information to guide their grasping movements. For example, they show poor performance in generating the correct gap between the index finger and thumb before making physical contact with the target object. However, their ability to visually recognize objects is normal (Goodale et al., 1994Goodale M.A. Meenan J.P. Bulthoff H.H. Nicolle D.A. Murphy K.J. Racicot C.I. Separate neural pathways for the visual analysis of object shape in perception and prehension.Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 604-610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Another source of evidence for the functional separation between perception and action comes from psychophysical studies in healthy human subjects. For example, Aglioti et al., 1995Aglioti S. DeSouza J.F. Goodale M.A. Size-contrast illusions deceive the eye but not the hand.Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 679-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar showed that grasp calibration is insensitive to robust perceptual illusions that result from surround effects (e.g., a target disk surrounded by smaller circles appears larger than the same disk surrounded by circles bigger than itself). Some indication for the functional separation between the visual pathways in humans can also be seen in recent fMRI studies. James et al., 2002James T.W. Humphrey G.K. Gati J.S. Menon R.S. Goodale M.A. Differential effects of viewpoint on object-driven activation in dorsal and ventral streams.Neuron. 2002; 35: 793-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar showed that the ventral object-related regions (ventral occipitotemporal cortex [VOT] and lateral occipital complex [LOC]) exhibit fMRI adaptation when the subject is viewing the same object from different viewpoints, but no such adaptation is found in the dorsal object-related areas (located in the caudal intraparietal sulcus [cIPS]). Culham et al., 2003Culham J.C. Danckert S.L. DeSouza J.F. Gati J.S. Menon R.S. Goodale M.A. Visually guided grasping produces fMRI activation in dorsal but not ventral stream brain areas.Exp. Brain Res. 2003; 153: 180-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar showed a complementary effect: visually guided grasping produced higher fMRI activation than reaching movements in the anterior intraparietal sulcus (aIPS), but not in ventral stream brain areas. To summarize, most of the evidence for the functional division in humans is either based on very few case studies or indirect evidence from psychophysical experiments. Although the fMRI studies mentioned above promote our understanding of the functional dissociation between the two streams, a carefully tailored fMRI study, aimed to provide direct evidence for the functional dissociation between the two visual streams in humans, has not been carried out. We therefore designed an fMRI experiment that could substantiate the claim for the perception/action division, using various analysis methodologies (see below). We took advantage of recent evidence from single unit recordings in monkeys that indicate that some dorsal stream areas (such as the inferior parietal lobule) are active during passive observation of object manipulation by others (Fogassi et al., 2005Fogassi L. Ferrari P.F. Gesierich B. Rozzi S. Chersi F. Rizzolatti G. Parietal lobe: from action organization to intention understanding.Science. 2005; 308: 662-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied the patterns of fMRI activation in the human dorsal and ventral pathways during observation of video clips showing object manipulation, using three different analysis methods:1.Contralateral bias: The bias toward a contralateral representation of the visual field is a robust characteristic of the visual cortex (Tusa et al., 1979Tusa R.J. Rosenquist A.C. Palmer L.A. Retinotopic organization of areas 18 and 19 in the cat.J. Comp. Neurol. 1979; 185: 657-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, Mountcastle et al., 1981Mountcastle V.B. Andersen R.A. Motter B.C.

A contralateral preference in the lateral occipital area: sensory and attentional mechanisms.Cereb. Cortex. 2005; 15: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We used asymmetric video clips in which a fixation point was located centrally, a hand was seen reaching from the right side, and manipulating objects positioned on the left visual field, or vice versa. We reasoned that areas sensitive to the reaching and grasping aspects should show mainly contralateral activation with respect to the hand position (i.e., left hemisphere dominance when the hand is seen approaching from the right side), while areas sensitive to the object identity are expected to show the opposite trend (i.e., right hemisphere dominance, since the objects were in the left visual field).2.Task-related activation: Varying the task that the subjects perform while the physical attributes of the visual stimuli remain constant across conditions may result in differences in fMRI activation. The functional separation hypothesis predicts that the dorsal areas will show greater activation during an action-oriented task (in our case, covertly answering how many fingers are involved in the grasping movement) than during an object-oriented task (i.e., covertly naming the object), while the converse is expected in the ventral pathway.3.fMRI adaptation (Grill-Spector and Malach, 2001Grill-Spector K. Malach R. fMR-adaptation: a tool for studying the functional properties of human cortical neurons.Acta Psychol. (Amst.). 2001; 107: 293-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar): Repetitive presentation of the same visual stimuli results in adaptation of the fMRI signal. We tested whether repeated observation of the same grasping action (irrespective of the object identity) would lead to adaptation in the dorsal pathway (but not in the ventral areas), while repeated observation of the same object (irrespective of the grasping characteristics) would result in adaptation in the ventral stream. The results from these three methods point toward a dissociation between ventral and dorsal stream fMRI activation during observation of object manipulation. These results support the concept of functional dissociation in the visual system and also suggest that some areas in the parietal cortex (such as the aIPS) may be engaged in action recognition as well as in action planning. We investigated the patterns of cortical activation using functional magnetic resonance imaging in two block design experiments. Each experiment contained five visual conditions, repeated four times in a counterbalanced manner. The experimental conditions included video clips of ten object manipulations by a single hand. The objects were on one side of the screen, and the grasping hand was mainly seen on the other side of the screen. The objects were stationary in all conditions. A control condition, composed of a spatially scrambled version of one of the object manipulation clips, was used for selection of voxels showing differential activation during the observation of object manipulation clips. The subjects were instructed to maintain fixation on a red point located in the center of the screen throughout the two experiments. The aim of this experiment was to differentiate between brain areas that are active during observation of actions and those involved in object recognition. One method we used took advantage of the bias toward a contralateral visual field representation which characterizes the visual system (Tusa et al., 1979Tusa R.J. Rosenquist A.C. Palmer L.A. Retinotopic organization of areas 18 and 19 in the cat.J. Comp. Neurol. 1979; 185: 657-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, Mountcastle et al., 1981Mountcastle V.B. Andersen R.A.

A contralateral preference in the lateral occipital area: sensory and attentional mechanisms.Cereb. Cortex. 2005; 15: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We generated video clips of object manipulation in which an object is present in the left visual field and the (right) hand, approaching from the right visual field, is seen grasping the object. We term this condition “Right hand/Left object.” In the other condition, the subjects were viewing the mirror image of those clips (i.e., “Left hand/Right object”). By contrasting the fMRI activation in these two conditions, we reasoned that areas engaged in the processing of objects will show a greater activation in the hemisphere contralateral to the object’s location, whereas areas that are engaged in processing of the hand action (present mainly in the opposite visual field) should display greater activation in the hemisphere contralateral to the hand position. Another method for dissociating between ventral and dorsal activation was to manipulate the task the subjects performed. The two sets of previously mentioned clips were actually shown twice: once while the subjects performed an object-oriented task, covertly naming the objects (“Name”), and once during performance of an action-oriented task, covertly counting how many fingers interact with the object (“Count”). The overall experimental design is shown in Figure 1. Eleven subjects were scanned while observing five different conditions: 1, “Left hand/Right object,” performing the task “Count”; 2, “Right hand/Left object,” performing the task “Count”; 3, “Right hand/Left object,” performing the task “Name”; 4, “Left hand/Right object,” performing the task “Name”; 5, spatially scrambled version of the object manipulation clips. Data were analyzed at two levels: group analysis and ROI analysis. Using group analysis, we show the effects of the asymmetry of the visual display (Figure 2) and task (Figure 4) in whole-brain statistical parameter maps. Subject by subject analysis (ROI analysis) was based on anatomically defined regions of interest (ROIs) within the object manipulation-related areas (showing significantly greater activation during the object manipulation conditions than during the scrambled condition) in each one of the subjects. In each ROI, we compared the fMRI activation during the various conditions, looking for significant differences between them (Figure 3, Figure 5).Figure 3Hand Action Viewing versus Object Viewing—Regions of Interest AnalysisShow full caption(A) Voxels displaying object manipulation-related activation were selected if anatomically located within two regions of interest (aIPS and FuG, in the two hemispheres) in each of the subjects.

Cortex. 2005; 15: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we suggest that the activation in the dorsal (parietal) areas is determined by the location of the active hand, whereas in the ventral (occipitotemporal) areas, the activation is dependent on the location of the viewed objects (note that both the manipulating hand and the objects are seen in all conditions). The contralateral preference for the active hand in the dorsal areas, as opposed to the object preference in the ventral areas, can also be seen in the majority of the individual subjects (see Figure S2 in the Supplemental Data available online).Table 1Brain Regions Showing Significantly Greater Activation during “Right Hand/Left Object” Clips than during “Left Hand/Right Object” Clips or Vice VersaArea NameTalairach CoordinatesCluster Size (mm3)Cluster AnalysisBAXYZAveraged T Valuep ValueRH, fusiform gyrus26−56−1054473.009 (Rh/Lo)0.0219RH, dorsal occipital14−79348522.88 (Rh/Lo)0.02219LH, fusiform gyrus−22−58−736552.81 (Lh/Ro)0.02419LH, dorsal occipital−11−79387902.74 (Rh/Lo)0.02619RH, cuneus3−75246463.02 (Lh/Ro)0.01818RH, cuneus5−7588112.656 (Lh/Ro)0.02918LH, superior temporal gyrus−38−52313812.94 (Lh/Ro)0.02139RH, lateral occipital sulcus43−6466983 (Lh/Ro)0.0237RH, superior parietal lobule24−50637052.97 (Lh/Ro)0.0227RH, IPS20−69539762.81 (Rh/Lo)0.0237RH, anterior IPS32−375518492.8 (Lh/Ro)0.02540LH, anterior IPS−36−425424592.86 (Rh/Lo)0.02340LH, middle frontal gyrus−27−105820753.12 (Lh/Ro)0.0196p < 0.05 (corrected). “Rh/Lo”: preference for the “Right hand/Left object” clips. “Lh/Ro”: preference for the “Left hand/Right object” clips.

Talairach coordinates denote the cluster’s center of mass. T values and p values denote averages across the cluster’s voxels. Next, we investigated whether the preference for the objects or the manipulating hand found in the ventral and dorsal areas, respectively, can also be seen in specific regions of interest on a subject by subject basis. A crucial point in such ROI analysis is to assure that the ROI voxels are selected so that no a priori bias is given for one object manipulation condition over the others. We therefore identified object manipulation-related areas in each subject as those showing significantly higher activation in the various object manipulation clips compared to the activation elicited by the observation of a scrambled version of those clips (all object manipulations > scramble, p < 0.01, correction for cluster size). Within those areas we identified in each one of the subjects four regions of interest: two in the vicinity of the intraparietal sulcus (left aIPS [n = 11, averaged cluster size = 2184 ± 286 mm3] and right aIPS [n = 11, averaged cluster size = 1742 ± 146 mm3]) and two in the ventral bank of the occipitotemporal cortex (left FuG [n = 11, averaged cluster size = 1343 ± 173 mm3] and right FuG [n = 9, averaged cluster size = 1263 ± 330 mm3; in two subjects, no significant cluster of activation was found in this ROI]). Next, we estimated the average percent signal change for each condition in the different ROIs. Figure 3A depicts the average percent signal change of the two “Right hand/Left object” conditions (averaged across the two tasks) and the two “Left hand/Right object” conditions. The results are consistent with the results of the group analysis. In the left aIPS, the activation is significantly higher for the condition “Right hand/Left object” than its mirror image (left aIPS, t = 8.2, p < 0.001), while in the right aIPS, the activation is significantly greater for the condition “Left hand/Right object” (right aIPS, t = 4.82, p < 0.001). The complementary picture was found in the FuG: significant preference for the “Left hand/Right object” condition can be seen in the left hemisphere (t = 2.36, p < 0.04), while in the right FuG, the preference is for the “Right hand/Left object” condition (t = 3.95, p < 0.003). These results show that, while both ventral and dorsal regions are activated during observation of object manipulation clips, the dorsal region of choice (aIPS) shows a contralateral preference for the hand action, whereas in the ventral ROI (FuG), the contralateral activation is determined by the object’s location. To illustrate the degree of consistency of this result between subjects, we also show the level of activation in each of the subjects during the four conditions. The contralateral preference shown in the averages across the two tasks (Figure 3A) is also evident in the single subjects’ activation profile, irrespective of the task performed (Figure 3B). Another technique that we used to show dissociation between ventral and dorsal activations was through manipulation of the task. Our prediction was that, in the dorsal areas, an action-oriented task will induce higher activation than the object-oriented task, while an object-oriented task will induce higher activation in the ventral areas. Figure 4 shows the results of group analysis. Significant preference for the action-oriented task (“Right hand/Left object” under the task “Count” + “Left hand/Right object” under the task “Count” > “Right hand/Left object” under the task “Name” + “Left hand/Right object” under the task “Name”) can be seen in the vicinity of the intraparietal sulcus, such as aIPS and post-central gyrus, bilaterally. Significant preference for the object-oriented task (the reverse contrast) can be seen in ventral occipital areas, such as FuG.

Open table in a new tab p < 0.05 (corrected). “Name”: preference for the object-oriented task (name the object). “Count”: preference for the action-oriented task (how many fingers interact with the object?). Talairach coordinates denote the cluster’s center of mass. T values and p values denote averages across the cluster’s voxels. We also measured the task-related changes in the fMRI signal in the ventral and dorsal ROIs (aIPS and FuG). The graphs in Figure 5 depict the average percent signal change (averaged across the two mirror conditions) during performance of each task. Consistent with the group analysis, preference for an object-oriented task (over the action-oriented one) can be seen in the ventral ROIs (right FuG, t = 2.45, p < 0.02; left FuG, t = 2.83, p < 0.02), while the reverse picture (preference for the action-oriented task) can be seen in the dorsal ROIs (right aIPS, t = 1.84, p < 0.1; left aIPS, t = 2.57, p < 0.03). Thus, in spite of the fact that the video clips were exactly the same, we found dissociation between the dorsal and ventral activations, which were solely governed by the attentional requirements. After showing dissociation between the dorsal and ventral activation during action observation, using the contralateral bias and task-related activation, we wanted to validate and further explore the separation between the representation of hand action and objects using the fMRI adaptation paradigm. In experiment I, we found evidence that the dorsal areas may be involved in the representation of the hand action. However, we cannot say which element of the hand action is represented in those areas—is it the hand, the interaction between the hand and the object, or motion per se? In the current experiment we investigated whether the representation in these areas is sensitive to properties of the grasping movements made upon the objects. If this is the case, repeated observation of the same grasping action (irrespective of the object identity) would lead to adaptation in the dorsal pathway (but not in the ventral areas), while repetition of the same object (irrespective of the grasping characteristics) would result in adaptation in the ventral stream. To investigate the importance of the observed interaction between the hand and the object, we added another condition, showing clips of pointing movement, in which similar hand motion was seen but there was no physical contact between the hand and the object. The overall experimental design is shown in Figure 6. The same eleven subjects were scanned while observing five conditions. In all conditions, the object was located on the left side of the screen, and the hand was mainly on the right side of the screen. The conditions were as follows: 1, ten similar grasping movements of the same object (termed “Same object/Same grasp”; SoSg); 2, ten different grasping movements of the same object (“Same object/Different grasp”; SoDg); 3, same grasping movement of ten different objects (“Different object/Same grasp”; DoSg); 4, ten different grasping movements of ten different objects (“Different object/Different grasp”; DoDg); 5, ten identical pointing movements toward the same object (“Point”). Analysis of the first four conditions allowed us to measure the effect of two adaptation factors: object-based adaptation and grasp viewing-based adaptation.

How X-chromosome counting regulates this process remains elusive, because neither the hypothesized inactivation ""blocking factor"" nor the required cis-elements have been defined. Here, a mouse knockout and transgenic analysis identified DNA sequences within the noncoding Tsix and Xite genes as numerators. Homozygous deficiency of Tsix resulted in ""chaotic choice"" and a variable number of inactive X's, whereas overdosage of Tsix/Xite inhibited X-inactivation. Thus, counting was affected by specific Tsix/Xite mutations, suggesting that counting is genetically separable from but molecularly coupled to choice. The mutations affect XX and XY cells differently, demonstrating that counting and choice are regulated not by one ""blocking factor,"" but by both a ""blocking"" and a ""competence"" factor."

Epithelium-stroma interactions play a critical role in prostate development and tumorigenesis.

Genome-wide expression was measured by DNA microarrays. Our analysis indicated that the gene expression pattern in the mouse dorsolateral lobe was closest to that of the human prostate peripheral zone, supporting the hypothesis that these prostate compartments are functionally equivalent. Stroma from a given lobe had closer gene expression patterns with stroma from other lobes than epithelium from the same lobe. Stroma appeared to have higher expression complexity than epithelium. Specifically, stromal cells had higher expression levels of genes implicated in cell adhesion, muscle development, and contraction, in structural constituents of cytoskeleton and actin binding, and in components such as sarcomere and extracellular matrix collagen.

Genetically engineered mice are an important model for studying the molecular mechanisms of prostate tumorigenesis (1Kasper S. Smith Jr., J.A. J. Urol. 2004; 172: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The usefulness of mice to model human prostate cancer is well accepted (1Kasper S. Smith Jr., J.A. J.

However, gene expression in mouse prostate has not been well characterized. More importantly, expression differences between the mouse prostate epithelium and stroma are largely unknown, despite the critical role of stromal-epithelial interactions in the development of normal prostate and prostate cancer. The mouse prostate consists of three distinct lobes (anterior, dorsolateral, and ventral), which differs anatomically from the human prostate (a single lobe with peripheral, transition, and central zones (3Shappell S.B.

Overall, this approach has identified many candidate biomarkers for prostate cancer and provided a wealth of information to further delineate molecular mechanisms of prostate cancer development. In the present study, we have determined mRNA expression profiles of the ventral, dorsolateral, and anterior prostate lobes in C57BL/6 and 129/SvEv mice, two of the most widely used strains in transgenic studies. Gene expression patterns were compared between epithelium and stroma, between different prostate lobes, and between mouse and human prostate. Differential expression of selected genes was validated by immunohistochemistry in normal and tumor mouse prostate. Importantly, our analysis provided, for the first time, molecular evidence establishing a functional equivalence between mouse dorsolateral lobe and human prostate peripheral zone, where the majority of human prostate cancers originate. Mouse Strains—Four- to five-week-old male C57BL/N6Tac and 129S6/SvEvTac mice were purchased from Taconic (Germantown, NY). Mice were housed in a pathogen-free facility for at least 1 week to reduce potential shipping stress. Prostate-specific Pten knock-out mice were generated by crossing Ptenloxp/loxp mice (16Lesche R. Groszer M. Gao J. Wang Y. Messing A. Sun H. Liu X. Wu H.

Ten lobes of each type from the same mouse strain were pooled and embedded in tissue freezing media (catalog no. TFM-5, Triangle Bio-medical Sciences, Inc.) and kept at -80 °C. Five-μm thick sections were cut with an RNase-free blade in a cryostat at -20 °C and stained with the HistoGene LCM frozen section staining kit (Arcturus, Mountain View, CA).

RNA quality and quantity were measured with Bioanalyzer pico chips (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA) (Fig. 1) and spectrophotometry. Approximately 200 ng of RNA from each sample were used for target labeling using the two-cycle cDNA synthesis protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). Fifteen μg of cRNA was hybridized to mouse expression 430 chip sets. Two to three biological replicas were performed for each data point. A total of 26 MOE430A and 26 MOE430B chips were used. Raw Data Processing—cel files were processed with the dCHIP software (18Li C. Hung Wong W. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (RESEARCH0032)Google Scholar, 19Li C. Wong W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (2713) Google Scholar). All arrays were normalized to a base-line array with a median probe intensity of 100. Because all normalization plots showed a correlation value with the base-line array r > 0.7, arrays were normalized and modeled in a single group. The perfect match-only model was used to obtain model-based expression indexes (MBEI). Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes—For epithelium-stroma comparisons, the anterior prostate epithelial (APE) samples were compared with the anterior prostate stromal (APS) samples (replica arrays of AP epithelium and stroma, respectively, from 129/SvEv and C57BL) with settings of APE/APS or APS/APE >2 (i.e. increase or decrease >2-fold) and APE-APS or APS-APE >100 (i.e. MBEI differences >100). Similarly, DL epithelium was compared with DL stroma and VP epithelium to VP stroma. Analysis of variance was performed among all samples. To identify differentially expressed genes between prostate lobes, replica arrays for stromal and epithelial samples of both mouse strains were combined for each lobe. Comparisons were performed between AP and DL, between AP and VP, and between DL and VP with the same criteria as above. Analysis of variance was performed among AP, DL, and VP. To identify differentially expressed genes between the prostate of C57BL and 129/SvEv, the C57 sample was compared with the 129 sample (replica arrays of APE, APS, DL epithelium, DL stroma, VP epithelium, and VP stroma from C57BL and 129/SvEv, respectively).

Arrays were normalized to a base-line array with a median probe intensity of 100. MBEI was calculated using the perfect match-only model. The list of differentially expressed genes between the mouse prostate lobes was queried using the NetAffx Analysis Center server (Affymetrix), and a list of ortholog genes on the HG-U95Av2 chip was obtained. The average MBEI of these ortholog genes was then obtained from the above mentioned ten human prostate samples. “High-level” Analysis—Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis were performed with differentially expressed genes using the Genesis software (20Sturn A. Quackenbush J. Trajanoski Z. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2002; 18: 207-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). Comparative analysis of gene sets in the gene ontology space was performed using the GoSurfer software with a setting node of ≥5 genes (a node in the gene ontology classification tree must have at least five genes with the same function from the input list) and a p value <0.01 (a significantly larger proportion of genes associated with the node from the input list compared with the list of total genes available on the Affymetrix arrays). Immunohistochemistry—Prostate lobes of Pten+/+, Pten+/-, and Pten-/- mice were dissected from 8-week-old F2 generation male mice, fixed with in formaldehyde, and embedded paraffin. Wild-type Pten+/+ and heterozygous (Pten+/-) prostates were histologically normal, whereas prostates of homozygous knock-out (Pten-/-) mice all developed carcinoma. Tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, and antigens were retrieved by incubating sections in antigen unmasking solution (catalog no. H-3300, Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA) at 95-96 °C for 1 h. Immunostaining was performed using the DAKO EnVion + system peroxidase (DAB) kit (catalog no. K4010, DakoCytomation Inc., Carpenteria, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All antibodies were used at 5 ng/μl concentration. Normal rabbit or goat IgG was used as a control. Rabbit anti-Ctgf (sc-25440), rabbit anti-Sparc (sc-25574), rabbit anti-Cxcr4 (sc-9046), goat anti-Cxcl12 (sc-6193), and normal rabbit (sc-2027) and goat IgG (sc-2028) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit anti-goat IgG (catalog no. 305-005-0030) was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). DNA Microarray Analysis—Mouse anterior, dorsolateral, and ventral prostate lobes were obtained from 6-week-old male 129S6/SvEvTac and C57BL/N6Tac mice. Epithelium and stroma were separated by laser-capture microdissection (Fig. 1). Global gene expression of the mouse prostate was measured using Affymetrix DNA oligo microarrays (26 MOE430A and 26 MOE430B chips). Two to three biological replicas were performed for each data point, i.e. stroma and epithelium of the anterior, dorsolateral, and ventral prostate from 129/SvEv and C57BL mice. Raw data were processed using the dCHIP software. All arrays showed good quality with low levels of array outliers (0.07-3%) and single outliers (0.06-1.5%).

Likewise, the β-microseminoprotein gene was highly expressed in ventral and dorsolateral prostate (26Thota A. Karajgikar M. Duan W. Gabril M.Y. Chan F.L. Wong Y.C. Sakai H. Chin J.L. Moussa M.

The tranglutaminase 4 (29Ho K.C. Quarmby V.E. French F.S. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

The vimentin and α-actin genes are known to be expressed in the stroma, whereas the E-cadherin and cytokeratin 8 genes are expressed in the secretory epithelium; these gene products were highest in the corresponding tissue type. p63 and the cytokeratin 5 and 14 genes, which are expressed in basal epithelial cells, were generally higher in the epithelium. The neuroendocrine cell markers chromogranin A and synaptophysin (3Shappell S.B. Thomas G.V. Roberts R.L. Herbert R. Ittmann M.M. Rubin M.A. Humphrey P.A. Sundberg J.P. Rozengurt N. Barrios R.

Comparison between Epithelium and Stroma—A list of differentially expressed genes was identified by comparing the expression profile of epithelium to stroma of the ventral, dorsolateral, or anterior prostate (supplemental Table I). Epithelium and stroma had distinctive expression patterns as illustrated by hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (Fig. 3). In general, similar tissues from both the C57BL and 129/SvEv mouse strains clustered together. Epithelial tissues of the same lobe from different strains of mice had the closest gene expression pattern. Dorsolateral epithelium showed an expression pattern distinct from anterior and ventral prostate epithelium, with a greater number of genes expressed at higher levels in dorsolateral epithelium. Stroma tissues of the same lobe from different mouse strains also had a similar gene expression pattern. Anterior and ventral prostate stroma had a closer expression pattern than dorsolateral stroma as well. Of the differentially expressed genes, a vast majority was expressed at higher levels in the stroma (TABLE ONE). Gene ontology mapping analysis indicated that these genes are implicated in biological processes such as cell adhesion, muscle development, and contraction, in biological functions such as structural constituent of cytoskeleton, actin binding, and extracellular matrix constituents, and in biological components such as sarcomere and extracellular matrix collagen (Fig. 4). These categories reflect products of the two major cell types in prostate stroma, i.e. fibroblast and smooth muscle cells. Among the epithelial samples, the dorsolateral lobe had the greatest number of transcripts expressed at high levels.TABLE ONEDifferential gene expression between epithelium and stroma in mouse prostate glandsTissueAPDLVPEaE, epithelium.SbS, stroma.ESESNumber of higher expressed transcriptscE/S or S/E>2;E-S or S-E>100.3223361940115Gene ontology noded≥5 genes in each node.

Open table in a new tab Comparison among Anterior, Dorsolateral, and Ventral Lobes—Differentially expressed genes were identified by comparing expression profiles of the ventral, dorsolateral, and anterior prostate after combining data from stroma and epithelia (supplemental Table II). The AP had a higher expression of enzymes with hydrolase activity (e.g. cathepsin C, complement component 1 r and s, pancreatic lipase-related protein 1 and 2, matrix metalloproteinase 7 genes, RIKEN cDNA 4921509F24). The DLP presented a higher level of molecules related to the microtubule-based process and microtubule cytoskeleton (e.g. α-tubulin 1 and 2, β-tubulin 3 and 5, kinesin 2 and 5c, and microtubule-associated protein tau genes). The VP showed an elevated level of oxidoreductase activity (e.g. pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase, aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1 (subfamily A1 and A7), carbonyl reductase 2 and 3, cytochrome P450 2f2, and hypothetical protein MGC11688 genes) as well as enzyme inhibitor activity (e.g. tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 4, stefin A1, procollagen type VI α 3, and annexin A1 genes). The ventral, dorsolateral, and anterior prostate had distinctive expression patterns as illustrated by hierarchical clustering (Fig. 5A). The same lobe from different mouse strains was most similar, and the AP and DLP shared a closer expression pattern compared with the VP (Fig. 5A). Comparison between Mouse Prostate Lobes and Human Prostate Peripheral Zone—196 ortholog genes were identified from the mouse 430 chip set and the human U95Av2 chip (Affymetrix). Model-based expression indexes were normalized within a given sample, and expression patterns were analyzed by hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis. Gene expression pattern in the peripheral zone of the human prostate appeared to be closest to that of the mouse dorsolateral lobe (Fig. 5B). This supports the hypothesis that the mouse dorsolateral lobe is equivalent to the human prostate peripheral zone (33Price D. Natl. Cancer Inst. Monogr. 1963; 12: 1-27PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of Osteogenic Genes in Prostate—Many of the genes that were differentially expressed between stroma and epithelium are known to play important roles in osteogenesis (TABLE TWO). Noticeably, all of these genes were expressed at higher levels in the stroma. The Cxcl12 chemokine and its receptor Cxcr4, connective tissue growth factor Ctgf, and Sparc (osteonectin) were further studied by immunohistochemistry in normal and tumor prostate of the Pten knock-out mice. Tumor suppressor gene Pten inactivation occurs frequently in human prostate tumor cells, and prostate-specific deletion of the Pten gene in mice leads to hyperplasia, intraepithelial neoplasia, invasive carcinoma, and metastasis, recapitulating the steps of prostate cancer development in humans (30Wang S. Gao J. Lei Q. Rozengurt N. Pritchard C. Jiao J. Thomas G.V. Li G. Roy-Burman P. Nelson P.S. Liu X. Wu H. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 209-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Anterior, dorsolateral, and ventral prostate lobes were dissected from 8-week-old Pten+/+, Pten+/- and Pten-/- mice, embedded in paraffin, and used for immunohistochemistry. Prostates of the Pten+/+ and Pten+/- mice were histologically normal, whereas prostates of the Pten-/- mice all developed carcinoma. In normal prostate, consistent with the microarray result, higher expression levels of Ctgf, Sparc (osteonectin), and Cxcl12 were seen in the stroma than in the epithelium (Fig. 6). Ctgf and Sparc were highly expressed in stromal cells (Fig. 6A), whereas strong immunoreactivity for Cxcl12 was found throughout the stroma, including the extracellular matrix (Fig. 6B). Sparc and Cxcl12 were also detectable in epithelial cells with an apical staining (Fig. 6). Normal prostate glands from Pten+/+ and Pten+/- had identical expression patterns (data not shown). Interestingly, in tumor prostate tissues, stromal Ctgf, Sparc, and Cxcl12 seemed to be reduced or lost, whereas they appeared to be increased in epithelial cells (Fig. 6). Expression of Cxcr4, the receptor for Cxcl12, was not detectable by DNA microarray or by immunohistochemistry in normal prostate glands. Strikingly, 60-70% of anterior and dorsolateral glands of tumor prostate expressed Cxcr4 (Fig. 6B). Ventral prostate glands also expressed Cxcr4, although to a variable extent among individual mice.TABLE TWOA list of “bone-related” molecules expressed in mouse prostate stroma cellsProbe setGeneTitleAccession no.p valueAPaFold higher expression in stroma than in epithelium.DLaFold higher expression in stroma than in epithelium.VPaFold higher expression in stroma than in epithelium.FunctionRef.1437889_x_atBgnBiglycanAI9318626.709E-102.913.281.78KO leads to osteoporosis1448323_a_atBC0195029.855E-122.913.311.83401416405_atBC0195024.072E-092.312.921448823_atCxcl12Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12BC0066400.00042793.861.982.65KO leads to bone marrow myelopoiesis411416953_atCtgfConnective tissue growth factorNM_0102172.518E-163.653.652.59Osteogenesis421424007_atGdf10Growth differentiation factor 10 (bone morphogenetic protein 3B)L421140.00204573.433.451.99Osteogenesis431448416_atMglapMatrix γ-carboxyglutamate (Gla) proteinNM_0085970.00067862.972.092.15Bone mineralization441419663_atOgnOsteoglycin (osteoinductive factor)BB5420510.0007097.254.521.95Bone formation451423606_atPostnPeriostin (osteoblast specific factor)BI1105653.365E-089.973.542.9Bone formation461448392_atSparcSecreted acidic cysteine-rich (glycoprotein (osteonectin)NM_0092420.00040555.152.412.59Bone calcification471416589_at8.022E-063.943.151.8a Fold higher expression in stroma than in epithelium.

Based on anatomic studies, Price (33Price D. Natl. Cancer Inst. Monogr. 1963; 12: 1-27PubMed Google Scholar) had proposed in 1963 that the mouse dorsolateral lobe was equivalent to the human prostate peripheral zone. Our observation that the gene expression pattern in the peripheral zone of the human prostate was closest to the mouse dorsolateral lobe constitutes the first molecular evidence in support of this hypothesis. Separate stroma and epithelium data were not available for the human prostate in the Harvard array set (11Singh D. Febbo P.G. Ross K. Jackson D.G. Manola J. Ladd C. Tamayo P. Renshaw A.A.

The Arabidopsis thaliana protein AtFOLT1 encoded by the At5g66380 gene is the closest homolog of the mitochondrial folate transporters (MFTs) characterized in mammalian cells. AtFOLT1 belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family, but GFP-tagging experiments and Western blot analyses indicated that it is targeted to the envelope of chloroplasts. By using the glycine auxotroph Chinese hamster ovary glyB cell line, which lacks a functional MFT and is deficient in folates transport into mitochondria, we showed by complementation that AtFOLT1 functions as a folate transporter in a hamster background. Indeed, stable transfectants bearing the AtFOLT1 cDNA have enhanced levels of folates in mitochondria and can support growth in glycine-free medium. Also, the expression of AtFOLT1 in Escherichia coli allows bacterial cells to uptake exogenous folate. Disruption of the AtFOLT1 gene in Arabidopsis does not lead to phenotypic alterations in folate-sufficient or folate-deficient plants. Also, the atfolt1 null mutant contains wild-type levels of folates in chloroplasts and preserves the enzymatic capacity to catalyze folate-dependent reactions in this subcellular compartment. These findings suggest strongly that, despite many common features shared by chloroplasts and mitochondria from mammals regarding folate metabolism, the folate import mechanisms in these organelles are not equivalent: folate uptake by mammalian mitochondria is mediated by a unique transporter, whereas there are alternative routes for folate import into chloroplasts.

Roje S. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 119-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Plants and most microorganisms can synthesize THF de novo, whereas mammals cannot and so require a dietary supply of this soluble vitamin. The plant THF biosynthesis has a unique and complex subcellular compartmentation split between three compartments (Fig. 1) (2Ravanel S. Douce R. Rebeille F. Day D.A. Millar A.H. Whelam J.

Folates are tripartite molecules comprising a pterin moiety, a p-aminobenzoate unit, and a γ-linked glutamate chain with one to eight residues. p-Aminobenzoate is formed from chorismate in plastids (3Basset G.J.

The enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase that elongates the glutamate chain exists in the cytosol, mitochondria, and plastids (9Ravanel S. Cherest H. Jabrin S. Grunwald D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Douce R.

This distribution suggests a complex traffic of THF, most probably in a monoglutamate form, and its precursors between the organelles and the cytosol (Fig. 1). In addition to intracellular transports, in vivo studies in Arabidopsis (10Prabhu V. Chatson K.B. Lui H. Abrams G.D. King J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 116: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 11Ishikawa T. Machida C. Yoshioka Y. Kitano H. Machida Y. Plant J. 2003; 33: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have shown that plants are able to take up C1 derivatives of THF from the medium (Fig. 1). None of the proteins involved in these multiple transport steps has been characterized so far in plants. In folate-auxotroph organisms, transport systems involved in the cellular uptake of folates have been cloned and characterized. The reduced folate carriers and the folate receptors mediate separate routes for folates uptake into mammalian cells (for a review, see Ref. 12Matherly L.H. Goldman D.I. Vitam. Horm. 2003; 66: 403-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In the parasitic protozoa Leishmania, the folate-biopterin transporter family includes high affinity folate transporters and a biopterin/folate transporter that are involved in the uptake of folates and the antifolate drug methotrexate (MTX) (13Kundig C. Haimeur A. Legare D. Papadopoulou B. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 14Richard D. Kundig C. Ouellette M. J. Biol.

Following their uptake, folates are either converted to polyglutamates to promote their retention in the cytosol or transported to the organelles where they are polyglutamylated to minimize their diffusion (16Appling D.R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2645-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial folate transporter (MFT) involved in the traffic of folates from the cytosol to the mitochondria has been cloned and functionally characterized in mammals (17Titus S.A. Moran R.G.

A point mutation within this protein rendered mitochondria unable to accumulate folates and cells that are auxotrophic for glycine (17Titus S.A. Moran R.G. J. Biol.

In animals, two multidrug resistance-associated proteins belonging to the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily are responsible for anti-folate detoxification (19Zeng H. Liu G. Rea P.A. Kruh G.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4779-4784PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zeng H. Chen Z.S. Belinsky M.G. Rea P.A. Kruh G.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7225-7232PubMed Google Scholar). These transporters catalyze a high capacity and low affinity transport of MTX and physiological folates, as well as a moderate-affinity and low capacity transport of several glutathione and glucuronate conjugates (19Zeng H. Liu G. Rea P.A. Kruh G.D. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4779-4784PubMed Google Scholar, 20Zeng H. Chen Z.S. Belinsky M.G. Rea P.A. Kruh G.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7225-7232PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the plasma membrane ATP-binding cassette transporter AtMRP4 from Arabidopsis has been implicated in the regulation of light-induced stomatal opening (21Klein M. Geisler M. Suh S.J. Kolukisaoglu H.U. Azevedo L. Plaza S. Curtis M.D. Richter A. Weder B. Schulz B. Martinoia E. Plant J. 2004; 39: 219-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). MTX, but not folates, was found to inhibit this process. The physiological significance of folates efflux across the plasma membrane and the link between this transport and guard cell regulation are still unclear. In the present work, we used a genomics-based approach to identify an Arabidopsis protein, called AtFOLT1, which is a homolog of the mammalian MFTs. Using GFP-tagging and Western blot analyses we showed that the AtFOLT1 protein is localized in the chloroplast envelope. To address whether AtFOLT1 was able to transport folates, Chinese hamster ovary glyB cells lacking a functional MFT were stably transfected with the AtFOLT1 cDNA. The AtFOLT1 protein could partially restore the mitochondrial pool of folates if expressed at sufficiently high levels and thus could complement the glycine auxotrophy demonstrated by glyB cells. Also, the expression of AtFOLT1 in Escherichia coli allows bacterial cells to uptake exogenous folic acid. These data indicate that AtFOLT1 functions as a folate transporter in two different heterologous expression systems. Disruption of the AtFOLT1 gene in Arabidopsis does not lead to any obvious phenotype when plants are grown under standard or folate-depleting conditions, and chloroplasts contain wild-type levels of folates and preserve their enzymatic capacity to catalyze THF-dependent reactions. These findings suggest strongly that, contrary to the unique MFT-mediated folate uptake system existing in mitochondria from mammals, there are alternative routes for import of folates into chloroplasts. Plant Growth Conditions—Wild-type and mutant Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia, Col-0) plants were grown on soil in a growth chamber (22 °C, 60% air humidity, light intensity of 150 μE m-2 s-1, 16 h light/8 h dark).

PCR was done with the proofreading Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) using the following primers: FT1-1, AGGATTCGTTGATGGCGGCG; FT1-2, GTGACAAGTCAACCGCGTGC; At2g47490-1, GGTGACGCGTTTCCTCAAGG; At2g47490-2, CCGGATTTAAAGTATAGAGCTTTG; At1g25380-1, CCCCCAATTGAGAGATTCTAGG; and At1g25380-2, ACGTAGTTGGAACATGGCATCG. The PCR products were subcloned into the pBluescriptII KS vector digested with SmaI and sequenced (GenomeExpress, Meylan, France). Localization of AtFOLT1:GFP—Plasmid p35Ω-sGFP(S65T) expressing an engineered version of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (24Chiu W. Niwa Y. Zeng W. Hirano T. Kobayashi H. Sheen J. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 325-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar) was used for transient expression experiments in Arabidopsis protoplasts. The full-length AtFOLT1 sequence was amplified from pKS-AtFOLT1 by high fidelity PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase and primers FT1-GFP5′ (GTCGACTGATGGCGGCGTCGTGGC) and FT1-GFP3′ (CCATGGAATCTTTTGTTGTTGGATGCTG). The resulting fragment was digested with SalI and NcoI and inserted between the corresponding sites of p35Ω-sGFP(S65T). The resulting plasmid pGFP-AtFOLT1 and p35Ω-sGFP(S65T) were used to transform protoplasts prepared from a 4-day-old Arabidopsis cell suspension culture essentially as described in Ref. 25Abel S.

GFP chimera bearing the transit peptide sequences of the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from Arabidopsis and dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase/dihydropteroate synthase from Pisum sativum were used as controls for the targeting of GFP to plastids and mitochondria, respectively (9Ravanel S. Cherest H. Jabrin S. Grunwald D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Douce R. Rébeillé F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 15360-15365Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a Leica TCS-SP2 operating system as described (9Ravanel S. Cherest H. Jabrin S. Grunwald D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Douce R. Rébeillé F.

CaPO4-mediated Transfection of AtFOLT1 into glyB Cells—The full-length AtFOLT1 sequence was excised from pKS-AtFOLT1 with XbaI and HindIII and subcloned into the same sites of pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid pcDNA-AtFOLT1 allows the expression of AtFOLT1 under the control of the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter. CHO glyB cells maintained in α minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) were plated at a density of 2 × 105 cells/100-mm plate. The following day, plasmid (5 μg/plate) was mixed with 1 m CaCl2 and HEBS (19.2 mm HEPES, 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.45 mm Na2PO4, and 10 mm dextrose) in a total volume of 1 ml/plate and added to the cells for 30 min at room temperature. Nine milliliters of media was added to each plate, and the cultures were incubated at 37 °C. Twenty-four h later, the cells were briefly shocked with Me2SO, the medium was changed, and the cells were allowed to recover for 48 h. Transfectants were selected in α minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 1 mg/ml of G418 with or without glycine in the medium. Cells were grown for 10 days and colonies were fixed, stained, and counted. Subcellular Distribution of Folates in glyB Transformants—Several colonies of glyB cells stably transfected with the AtFOLT1 construct were selected and expanded into cultures. Cultures were seeded at 6 × 106/175 cm2 in α minimal essential medium supplemented with dialyzed fetal calf serum and 0.3 μCi/ml [3H]folic acid (Moravek) for 48 h. Cells were then harvested by trypsinization and pelleted. The pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (5% fetal calf serum), counted, and re-pelleted. The cells were homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose and 1 mm EDTA using a hand-held Dounce homogenizer, and the various subcellular fractions (nuclei and unbroken cells, mitochondria, and cytosol) were isolated by centrifugation as described previously (17Titus S.A. Moran R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36811-36817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Radioactivity in the various fractions was determined by scintillation counting. Expression of AtFOLT1 in E. coli JM105 Cells—The AtFOLT1 coding sequence lacking the first six residues located before the first predicted transmembrane α-helix was amplified from pcDNA-AtFOLT1 by high fidelity PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase and primers FT1-pTrc5′ (GGAATTCCATATGGAAAATGCCACCGCCGGC) and FT1-pTrc3′ (ACGAGCTCCTAATCTTTTGTTGTTGGATGC). The resulting fragment was digested with EcoRI and SacI, and inserted between the corresponding sites of pTrc99A (Amersham Biosciences). The resulting plasmid pTrc-AtFOLT1 was introduced first in E. coli DH5α strain, the sequence was verified, and then the plasmid was added into E. coli JM105 strain. Independent transformants harboring pTrc-AtFOLT1 or the empty pTrc99A vector were grown in LB containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin until A600 reached 0.3. Cells were collected by centrifugation, washed three times in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl, and diluted to A600 = 0.0015 in M9 minimal medium (26Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd. Ed.. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) containing 0.4% (w/v) glucose, 10 μg/ml thiamine, 100 μg/ml carbenicillin, and 30 μm asulam. Folic acid (50 μm) and/or IPTG (1 mm) were added to this medium, and cells were allowed to grow at 37 °C. Bacterial growth was monitored by measuring A600. To analyze the expression of AtFOLT1 in JM105 cells, pTrc-At-FOLT1 and pTrc99A transformants were grown in LB medium until A600 was 0.6, at which point 1 mm IPTG was added. Incubation was continued at 37 °C, and cells were collected by centrifugation at different time intervals and then suspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Total proteins from ∼2 × 108 cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot using purified AtFOLT1 antibodies. Nucleic Acid Manipulations—For PCR analysis Arabidopsis genomic DNA was isolated as described in Ref. 27Doyle J.J. Doyle J.L. Focus. 1990; 12: 13-15Google Scholar and amplified using the Titanium™ TaqDNA polymerase (Clontech) and primer pairs specific for the AtFOLT1 gene (FT1-2 and FT1-5, CGACCTAGTACCAACGGAATCC) or the T-DNA insertion (RB1, GCTCATGATCAGATTGTCGTTTCCCGCCTT and LB1, GGCAATCAGCTGTTGCCCGTCTCACTGGTG). Amplicons were separated by 1.4% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis, purified, and sequenced. For Southern analysis, genomic DNA was digested, separated by 0.7% (w/v) agarose gel, and transferred to a Hybond-N+membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was at 42 °C in 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 50% (v/v) formamide, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA. The 4.9-kb BglII fragment of the pROK2 vector corresponding to the entire T-DNA region (28Baulcombe D.C. Saunders G.R. Bevan M.W. Mayo M.A. Harrison B.D. Nature. 1986; 321: 446-449Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and the full-length AtFOLT1 cDNA were labeled with 32P using random primers and used as probes. For RT-PCR analysis, total RNA was isolated from leaves by using the RNeasy plant mini extraction kit (Qiagen). RNA (3 μg) was treated with DNase I, and first strand cDNA was synthesized with the ThermoScript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). AtFOLT1 and actin2 (At5g09810) were amplified by PCR with the Titanium™ TaqDNA polymerase using specific primers: FT1-1 and FT1-11, CTGCCTCTAGCGTACCTCTGC; At5g09810-Fwd, ACATCGTTCTCAGTGGTGGTTC; and At5g09810-Rev, ACCTGACTCATCGTACTCACTC. Amplicons were then analyzed by 1.4% (w/v) agarose gel electrophoresis. Folates Measurements in Leaves and Chloroplasts—Folates were determined using the microbiological assay with Lactobacillus casei ATCC7469 (American Type Culture Collection) as described in Ref. 29Gambonnet B.

Leaves were harvested at different stages of development and ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen before extraction of folates. Chloroplasts from 3-week-old Arabidopsis rosettes were purified on Percoll gradients as described in Ref. 30Block M.A. Tewari A.K. Albrieux C. Marechal E. Joyard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 240-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar. Intact chloroplasts were submitted to three freeze/thaw cycles to ensure complete lysis, and membranes were removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for folates and protein measurements (31Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Extraction and Immunoblot Analysis—Soluble proteins from Arabidopsis leaves were extracted by grinding powdered samples in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm aminocaproic acid. Samples were centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used as a source of soluble proteins. Total proteins were extracted in the above buffer containing 1% (w/v) SDS, incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used as a source of total proteins. Intact Percoll-purified chloroplasts were lysed in the hypotonic protein extraction buffer described above and plastidial subfractions (envelope, thylakoids, and stroma) were separated by ultracentrifugation on a step gradient of sucrose as described in Ref. 32Ferro M.

The synthetic AtFOLT1 peptide RAKQRYARGRDDEK (residues 90-103) coupled to the carrier protein KLH was used to raise a rabbit polyclonal serum (Neosystem SA, Strasbourg, France). IgG were purified from the serum using a HiTrap NHS-activated HP column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Purified antibodies were further desalted in phosphate-buffered saline and concentrated using a Microsep 3K unit. Primary antibodies were detected by using a chemiluminescent detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Cloning of Mammalian MFT Homologs in Arabidopsis—We searched the Arabidopsis genome for genes encoding putative homologs of the human mitochondrial folate transporter (HsMFT) and found that all the candidates were hypothetical members of the mitochondrial carrier family. In silico analysis of the complete Arabidopsis genome has revealed 57 members in this family, of which only onefourth have been functionally characterized (34Palmieri F. Picault N. Palmieri L. Hodges M. Day D.A. Millar A.H. Whelam J. Advances in Photosynthesis and Respiration. Plant Mitochondria, from Genome to Function. 17. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2004: 247-276Google Scholar). Among the best hits of our BLASTP search, the product of the At5g66380 gene shared the highest sequence identity with the human and zebrafish MFTs (40.9 and 36.8%, respectively) (Fig. 2). The corresponding cDNA (named AtFOLT1 for A. thaliana FOLate Transporter 1) was cloned by PCR using reverse-transcribed mRNAs from the Wassilewskija ecotype. Sequence analysis revealed nine nucleotide changes between the AtFOLT1 and At5g66380 cDNA (ecotype Columbia, GenBank™ accession number BT010139). Among these changes, only one leads to an altered amino acid at position 26 (Pro for AtFOLT1, Ser for At5g66380). It is unlikely that this point mutation affects the AtFOLT1 function because: (i) the full-length Arabidopsis (ecotype Columbia) cDNA sequenced by the CERES company (CERES:118596) also encodes for a Pro at position 26; (ii) a Pro residue is present at the same position on the human and zebrafish MFTs; and (iii) this Pro residue is included in one of the energy signature motifs characteristic of the mitochondrial carrier family (Fig. 2B), in which it is involved in the three-dimensional organization of the odd-numbered transmembrane helices (35Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trezeguet V. Lauquin G.J. Brandolin G. Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The cDNAs coding the At2g47490 and At1g25380 proteins, which share 31-36% identity with HsMFT (Fig. 2), were also cloned by PCR. These cDNAs showed two and one polymorphic sites, respectively, compared with the corresponding sequences deposited in the Arabidopsis Information Resource data base (www.arabidopsis.org). Of these SNP, two resulted in silent substitutions for the At2g47490 cDNA, and one in a change from a Leu (position 84, Wassilewskija sequence) to Ser (Col-0 sequence) in the At1g25380 protein. AtFOLT1 is a 34-kDa protein that exhibits a hydrophobic profile with six putative transmembrane domains, a tripartite structure made up of related tandem domains of about 100 residues in length, and sequence motifs that are characteristic of the mitochondrial carrier family (34Palmieri F. Picault N. Palmieri L. Hodges M. Day D.A. Millar A.H. Whelam J. Advances in Photosynthesis and Respiration. Plant Mitochondria, from Genome to Function. 17. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2004: 247-276Google Scholar). Sequence homology between AtFOLT1 and HsMFT extends throughout the entire proteins and several highly conserved blocks are preserved (Fig. 2B). They particularly correspond to the six putative transmembrane α-helices and the three domains located within pairs of odd- and even-numbered helices, which are predicted to extrude into the matrix side of the membrane (18McCarthy E.A.

Subcellular Localization of AtFOLT1—Not all of the members of the plant mitochondrial carrier family are actually targeted to mitochondria because the plastid envelope membrane harbors several transporters of this family (for a review see Ref. 36Weber A.P.

https://openalex.org/W2142190749,"Articulated embryos from the Lower Jurassic Elliot Formation of South Africa are referable to the prosauropod Massospondylus carinatus and, together with other material, provide substantial insights into the ontogenetic development in this early dinosaur. The large forelimbs and head and the horizontally held neck indicate that the hatchlings were obligate quadrupeds. In contrast, adult Massospondylus were at least facultatively bipedal. This suggests that the quadrupedal gait of giant sauropods may have evolved by retardation of postnatal negative allometry of the forelimbs. Embryonic body proportions and an absence of well-developed teeth suggest that hatchlings of this dinosaur may have required parental care."

However, taste representations in the brain remain elusive. We used a genetic approach to visualize the neuronal circuitries of bitter and sweet tastes in mice to gain insight into how taste recognition is accomplished in the brain. By selectively expressing a transsynaptic tracer in either bitter- or sweet and/or umami-responsive taste receptor cells, and by comparing the locations of the tracer-labeled neurons in the brain, our data revealed the potential neuronal bases that underlie discrimination of bitter versus sweet."
https://openalex.org/W2055439137,"Animals alter their behavioral patterns in an experience-dependent manner. Olfactory imprinting is a process in which the exposure of animals to olfactory cues during specific and restricted time windows leaves a permanent memory (""olfactory imprint"") that shapes the animal's behavior upon encountering the olfactory cues at later times. We found that Caenorhabditis elegans displays olfactory imprinting behavior that is mediated by a single pair of interneurons. To function in olfactory imprinting, this interneuron pair must express a G protein-coupled chemoreceptor family member encoded by the sra-11 gene. Our study provides insights into the cellular and molecular basis of olfactory imprinting and reveals a function for a chemosensory receptor family member in interneurons."
https://openalex.org/W2035920778,"Although protein kinase C (PKC) has been widely implicated in the positive and negative control of proliferation, the underlying cell cycle mechanisms regulated by individual PKC isozymes are only partially understood. In this report, we show that PKCδ mediates phorbol ester-induced G1 arrest in lung adenocarcinoma cells and establish an essential role for this novel PKC in controlling the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21. Activation of PKC with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in early G1 phase impaired progression of lung adenocarcinoma cells into S phase, an effect that was completely abolished by specific depletion of PKCδ, but not PKCα. Although the PKC effect was unrelated to the inhibition of cyclin D1 expression, PKC activation significantly up-regulated p21 and down-regulated Rb hyperphosphorylation and cyclin A expression. Elevations in p21 mRNA and protein by PMA were mediated by PKCδ but not PKCα. Studies using luciferase reporters also revealed an essential role for PKCδ in the PMA-induced inhibition of Rb-dependent cyclin A promoter activity. Finally, we showed that the cell cycle inhibitory effect of PKCδ is greatly attenuated by RNA interference-mediated knock-down of p21.

Such a wide range of biological responses triggered by phorbol esters relates to the multiplicity of intracellular effectors for these compounds, which include the classic PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ), the novel PKCs (δ, ϵ, η, and θ), as well as PKC-related kinases and non-kinase phorbol ester receptors (5Newton A.C.

The observed changes in the expression and function of different PKC isozymes and their downstream effectors in various types of human cancers, including lung, colon, prostate, and breast cancer, suggests that dysregulation of PKC signaling may be a factor in uncontrolled cell proliferation and neoplastic transformation (7Gavrielides M.V.

In particular, PKCδ has become the focus of numerous studies due to its tumor suppressor activity both in cellular and animal models (19Lu Z. Hornia A. Jiang Y. Zang Q. Ohno S. Foster D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3418-3428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Reddig P.J. Dreckschimdt N.E. Ahrens H. Simsiman R. Tseng C.P. Zou J. Oberley T.D. Verma A.K.

Deciphering isozyme-specific functions in the context of cell cycle regulation should uncover potential signaling targets for the therapy of cancer and other proliferative diseases. It is well established that normal progression through the cell cycle is a highly coordinated process that depends on cyclins, Cdks (cyclin-dependent kinases) and Cdk inhibitors. Although it is not yet fully understood how individual PKC isozymes control cell cycle progression, it is clear that PKC activation has profound effects on both the G1/S transition as well as on progression through G2 phase. Indeed, substantial evidence supports a role for PKCs in the regulation of the cell cycle machinery, either by translational or post-translational mechanisms. PKCs can influence the G1 phase by regulating the activity of specific cdk-cyclin complexes and the phosphorylation status of pRB, a critical regulator of G1/S transition, ultimately controlling the expression of E2F-regulated genes (2Black J.D. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: d406-d423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Gavrielides M.V. Frijhoff A.F. Conti C.J. Kazanietz M.G. Curr. Drug Targets. 2004; 5: 431-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For example, studies in NIH 3T3 cells have shown that the novel PKCη inhibits cdk2 activity, leading to G1 arrest (3Fima E. Shtutman M. Libros P. Missel A. Shahaf G. Kahana G. Livneh E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6794-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In vascular endothelial cells, PKC effects on cdk2 activity do not involve changes in cdk2 expression but rather reflect changes in the expression levels of cyclins A and E (22Zhou W. Takuwa N. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23041-23048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Zhou W. Takuwa N. Kumada M. Takuwa Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Another mechanism by which PKCs influence the G1/S transition is through the modulation of cdk inhibitors. Indeed, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) up-regulates p21 in a p53-independent manner in many cell types (24Akashi M. Osawa Y. Koeffler H.P. Hachiya M. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 25Zeng Y.X. el-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1557-1564PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence linking G1 arrest to p27 up-regulation in response to phorbol esters has also been presented in U937 leukemia cells (26Vrana J.A. Kramer L.B. Saunders A.M. Zhang X. Dent P. Povirk L.F. Grant S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A series of elegant studies by Black and coworkers (27Clark J.A. Black A.R. Leontieva O.V. Frey M.R.

PKCδ was reported to regulate G1/S and G2/M transitions (2Black J.D. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: d406-d423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Gavrielides M.V. Frijhoff A.F. Conti C.J. Kazanietz M.G. Curr. Drug Targets. 2004; 5: 431-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting a high level of complexity in the regulation of downstream events by this novel PKC. Importantly, the vast majority of these early studies has relied heavily on overexpression strategies or the use of pharmacological tools and dominant-negative mutants of questionable specificity. In this report, we explore the role of PKC isozymes as mediators of phorbol ester-induced control of proliferation in lung cancer cells. Thus far, little is known about the role of individual PKCs in cell cycle control in lung cancer cells, particularly those isozymes that could be potentially growth inhibitory. Despite the limited mechanistic information available, ongoing efforts aimed at targeting PKC isoforms for lung cancer therapy are being developed (8Hemström T.H. Joseph B. Schulte G. Lewensohn R. Zhivotovsky B. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 305: 200-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 30Tortora G. Ciardiello F. Semin. Oncol. 2003; 30: 26-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). PKC isozymes have also been linked to a chemo-resistant phenotype in lung cancer and have been implicated in tobacco carcinogenesis (31Clark. A.S. West K.A. Blumberg P.M. Dennis P.A.

By using RNAi to knock-down individual PKCs in a lung cancer cell model, we have determined an absolute requirement of PKCδ for phorbol ester-induced G1 arrest. This novel PKC is essential for phorbol ester-induced up-regulation of p21 and inhibition of cyclin A promoter activity. Materials—Cell culture medium was purchased from Invitrogen. PMA and its inactive isomer 4α-PMA were obtained from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA) and dissolved in ethanol. The pan-PKC inhibitor GF109203X (bisindolilmaleimide I) was from BIOMOL Research Laboratories Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Gö6976 was purchased from Alexis (San Diego, CA). Propidium iodide was from Sigma. Cell Culture—H441 and H358 lung adenocarcinoma cancer cell lines (bronchoalveolar type) were used. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cell Proliferation Assays—Cells (1 × 105) cells were seeded 6-well plates. After incubation for 24 h in normal medium, cells were treated with different concentration of PMA for 1 h. Cells were trypsinized at different times and counted in a hemocytometer. For the MTS assay, H358 cells were seeded in 96-well plates. After incubation for 24 h in normal medium, cells were treated with different concentrations of PMA for 1 h. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for an additional 24-h period. Absorbance at 490 nm was determined with the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). When PKC inhibitors were used, they were added to the culture 30 min before and during PMA treatment. Adenoviral Infections—H358 cells were infected with a replication-deficient adenovirus (AdV) for PKCδ or a control LacZ AdV (4Fujii T. García-Bermejo M.L. Bernabó J.L. Caamaño J. Ohba M. Kuroki T.

After removal of the AdV by extensive washing, cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Expression of recombinant protein was readily detected after 14 h and remained stable for several days (data not shown). Amplification of AdVs was carried out in 293 packaging cells. Titers of viral stocks were normally higher than 1 × 109 pfu/cell. In some experiments infections were carried out 24 h after transfection of cells with dsRNA (see below). Cell Cycle Assays—H358 cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes (∼50% confluency) and serum-starved for 24 h. Approximately 80% of the cells were synchronized in G0 after serum starvation. Synchronized cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium with or without PMA for 1 h and then collected at selected times for propidium iodide staining (0.1 mg/ml) followed by flow cytometry analysis, as reported previously (4Fujii T. García-Bermejo M.L. Bernabó J.L. Caamaño J. Ohba M. Kuroki T. Li L. Yuspa S.H. Kazanietz M.G. J. Biol.

Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 nm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol. Cell extracts (20 μg of protein/lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MD). After blocking with 5% milk in 0.05% Tween 20/phosphate-buffered saline, membranes were incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h. Either anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (1:3000, Bio-Rad) were used as secondary antibodies. Bands were visualized with a chemiluminescence detection kit (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Densitometric analysis was performed under conditions that yielded a linear response using ImageJ software. The following first antibodies were used: anti-PKCα (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY); anti-PKCδ, anti-cyclin A, anti-cyclin B1, anti-cyclin D1, anti-p21, anti-p27, and anti-cdk4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); anti-PKCβ, anti-PKCϵ, anti-PKCθ, and anti-PKCζ (BD Transduction Laboratories); and anti-phospho T821 Rb (AbCam, Cambridge, MA). RNA Interference— dsRNAs were purchased from Dharmacom Inc. (Dallas, TX). The following targeting sequences were used: PKCα (AATCCTTGTCCAAGGAGGCTG), PKCδ (AACCATGAGTTTATCGCCACC), and p21 (AACATACTGGCCTGGACTGTT). dsRNAs were transfected into H358 cells using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Experiments were carried out 48 h after transfection. Quantitative Real-time RT-PCR—Cells were lysed in 500 μl of TRIzol (Invitrogen), and total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA (20 ng) from each sample was used for cDNA synthesis using reverse transcription reagents from Applied Biosystems Inc. (5.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dNTP, 2.5 μm oligo(dT) or 2.5 μm random hexamers, 8 units of RNase I, and 25 units of Multiscribe reverse transcriptase per 20 μl of reaction). cDNA (2.5 μl) was subjected to 40 amplification cycles of Q-PCR (Applied Biosystems Prism 7000 sequence detection system) using TaqMan universal PCR master mix in a 25-μl reaction. For human p21 mRNA, each real-time PCR reaction contained 1.25 μlof20× p21 TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (Applied Biosystems Inc.). For human cdk4 mRNA, each real-time PCR reaction contained 150 nm forward primer 5′-ACAAGTGGTGGAACAGTCAAGCT, 200 nm reverse primer 5′-GCATATGTGGACTGCAGAAGAACT, and 150 nm TAMRA™ probe 5′-VIC™-ATGGCACTTACACCCGTGGTTGTTACACTCT-TAMRA. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate, and mRNA levels were quantified by reference to a standard curve using the Prism 7000 sequence detection software. p21 mRNA expression was normalized to cdk4 mRNA expression, which did not vary during serum stimulation or PMA treatment. Cell Transfections and Promoter Analyses—H358 cells (∼5 × 105, ∼80% confluency) in 35-mm dishes were transiently co-transfected with +CRE and -CRE cyclin A promoter-luciferase vectors (34Kothapalli D. Stewart S.A. Smyth E.M. Azonobi I. Puré E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using 5 μl of Lipofectamine Plus reagent, 1 μg of cyclin A promoter-luciferase plasmid, and either 1 μg of a human papilloma virus type-18 E7 expression vector or 1 μg of empty vector. A Renilla luciferase expression plasmid (0.01 μg, pRL-CMV, Promega) was co-transfected for normalization of transfection efficiency. After an overnight recovery, cells were serum-starved for 24 h, treated with either 10 nm PMA or vehicle for 1 h, and stimulated with 10% FBS for different times. Cyclin A promoter-driven luciferase activity was determined and normalized to Renilla luciferase, as previously described (34Kothapalli D. Stewart S.A. Smyth E.M. Azonobi I. Puré E. Assoian R.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). PMA Induces G1 Arrest in Bronchoalveolar Cells via PKC Activation—To determine whether phorbol esters affect proliferation of lung adenocarcinoma cells, asynchronous H358 and H441 cells were treated with different concentrations of PMA (1 nm to 1 μm, 1 h). PMA was removed by extensive washing, and cell number was determined at different times. Fig. 1A shows that PMA treatment caused a dose-dependent reduction in cell number, both in H358 and H441 cells. No evidence of apoptosis was detected upon PMA treatment, as judged by the lack of nuclear fragmentation and the absence of a sub-G0/G1 population upon flow cytometry analysis (data not shown). Assessment of cell proliferation in H358 cells with an MTS assay also revealed a significant dose-dependent inhibition by PMA. The inactive analog 4α-PMA (100 nm), on the other hand, was ineffective. The “pan” PKC inhibitor GF109203X (bisindolylmaleimide I) completely blocked the effect of PMA (Fig. 1B). Thus, the effect was mediated by PMA-responsive PKC isozymes and not by other endogenous phorbol ester receptors present in these cells (13Yang C. Kazanietz M.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 602-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To determine whether phorbol ester treatment influences the G1/S transition, we synchronized H358 cells in G0 by serum starvation and examined the effect of PMA upon serum release. The maximum percentage of cells in G0 (∼80%) was achieved upon 24-h serum starvation (data not shown). H358 cells entered S phase ∼12 h after serum release, with the maximum percentage of cells in S phase observed at 18 h (Fig. 1C). At 24 h, the majority of cells were in G2 (data not shown). When H358 cells were treated with PMA (100 nm, 1 h) at t = 0 h, cells were unable to progress into the S phase (Fig. 1, C and D). The arrest caused by PMA was fully blocked with the GF109203X but not by Gö6976, an inhibitor of the classic PKCs. Representative flow cytometry experiments are depicted in Fig. 1D. Analysis of the expression of cyclins in untreated cells revealed that cyclin D1 is significantly elevated 6 h after serum release, which corresponded with an increase in Rb phosphorylation (Fig. 1E). As expected, cyclins A and B become elevated at later time points. Treatment of H358 cells with PMA significantly impaired cyclin A and cyclin B up-regulation. Analysis of cdk inhibitors revealed that PMA caused a strong and sustained up-regulation of p21, without any significant up-regulation in the levels of p27. Because up-regulation of p21 prevents Rb dephosphorylation, we determined phospho-Rb levels using a phospho-specific antibody (phospho T821 Rb). Consistent with the p21 up-regulation, a marked reduction in phosphorylated Rb was detected in PMA-treated cells. Studies in various cell models have suggested differential roles for PKC in early- and late-G1 phase. Thus, we decided to examine the consequence of adding PMA (100 nm) for 1 h at different times after serum release in H358 cells (Fig. 2). The inhibitory effect of PMA was only observed when added at early times in G1 but not at later time points. Indeed, addition of PMA at t = 0-8 h impaired cell progression into the S phase, whereas addition of PMA at t ≥12 h was clearly ineffective, suggesting that only PKC activation in early-mid G1 phase caused cell cycle arrest. The Inhibitory Effect of PMA on G1/S Progression Is Mediated by PKCδ—H358 cells express three phorbol ester-responsive PKCs: one classic PKC (PKCα) and two novel PKCs (PKCδ and PKCϵ). In addition, they express the phorbol ester unresponsive PKCζ (Fig. 3A). Growth inhibitory roles have been ascribed to PKCα and/or PKCδ in various cell models. The lack of effect of Gö6976, the inhibitor of classic PKCs (see Fig. 1D), led us to speculate that PKCδ may be a key mediator of the growth inhibitory effect of PMA in H358 cells. To address this issue we depleted individual PKCs in H358 cells using RNAi. Upon transfection of specific dsRNAs for either PKCα or PKCδ, reductions of 69 ± 19% and 81 ± 9% in PKCα and PKCδ levels were achieved, respectively (Fig. 3, B and C). Analysis of cell proliferation in knock-down cells revealed remarkable differences in each case. Cell cycle analysis revealed that normal progression into the S phase upon serum stimulation (in the absence of PMA treatment) was not affected when either PKC was knocked down. However, in PKCδ-depleted cells, PMA was unable to cause G1 arrest, because the cells progress normally into the S phase. On the other hand, PMA fully arrested H358 cells in which PKCα has been depleted (Fig. 3D), suggesting that this isozyme was dispensable for the PMA effect. Taken together, these results indicate that PKCδ mediates the anti-proliferative effect of PMA in H358 cells. p21 Is Required for PMA- and PKCδ-induced G1 Arrest in H358 Cells—Up-regulation of p21 in response to phorbol esters has been reported in several cellular models. H358 cells are p53-null (35Zou Y Zong G. Ling Y.H. Hao M.M. Lozano G. Hong W.K. Perez-Soler R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), thus p21 up-regulation in response to PMA in these cells (see Fig. 2E) is p53-independent. To determine the requirement of p21 in PMA-induced G1 phase arrest, a specific dsRNA was designed, which depleted this cdk inhibitor by 66% upon delivery into H358 cells (Fig. 4A). No effect was observed using an unrelated dsRNA designed to deplete GFP (data not shown). Next, we examined the effect of PMA on G1/S progression in p21-depleted cells. Indeed, upon p21 RNAi the G1 arrest induced by PMA was significantly impaired (Fig. 4, B and C). Moreover, the loss of Rb phosphorylation in response to PMA was also significantly inhibited upon depletion of p21 (Fig. 4D). Thus, p21 is required for PMA-induced G1 arrest in H358 cells. Overexpression of PKCδ Inhibits H358 Cell Proliferation—To further establish a role for PKCδ as inhibitor of proliferation in H358 cells, we assessed the effect of PKCδ overexpression using an adenoviral delivery approach. After infection of H358 cells with increasing multiplicities of infection (m.o.i. values) of a PKCδ AdV, elevated levels of this PKC were readily detected (Fig. 5A). PKCδ overexpression caused a significant reduction in cell number. No evidence of apoptosis was observed (data not shown). On the other hand, a control LacZ AdV, which has the same backbone as the PKCδ AdV, did not reduce H358 cell number at an m.o.i. = 300 pfu/cell (Fig. 5B). Notably, PKCδ overexpression in H358 cells led to a significant elevation in p21 levels. Similar results were observed in H441 cells (Fig. 5A). We next assessed whether p21 depletion could affect the inhibitory effect of PKCδ. H358 cells were subjected to p21 RNAi and then infected with the PKCδ AdV (m.o.i. = 100 pfu/cell). The anti-proliferative effect observed by PKCδ overexpression (assessed 48 h after infection with the PKCδ AdV) was significantly impaired in p21-depleted cells compared with control cells (Fig. 5C). The rescue effect was partial (∼50%), probably due to the strong and persistent nature of the stimulation caused by PKCδ overexpression and to the fact that p21 knock-down in H358 cells was not complete (see Fig. 4A). Nevertheless, this effect was not observed when an unrelated control dsRNA (GFP) was delivered into H358 cells. Taken together, these experiments strongly support an anti-proliferative role for PKCδ in human bronchoalveolar cells and indicate that p21 is a major effector of PKCδ in this context. PKCδ Mediates PMA-induced Elevations in p21—Based on the information presented above, we hypothesized that PKCδ may be required for p21 up-regulation in response to PMA. To prove this concept we determined p21 levels in response to PMA in PKC knock-down cells. Notable differences in p21 expression were found between PKCα- and PKCδ-depleted cells. Indeed, although in PKCα knock-down H358 cells PMA-induced elevations in p21 protein levels were minimally affected, the PMA effect was blunted after PKCδ RNAi. PKCδ RNAi also impaired PMA-induced up-regulation of p21 in H441 cells (Fig. 6A). To further strengthen these results, we next assessed p21 mRNA levels by Q-PCR. A time-course analysis showed that p21 mRNA levels in H358 cells are elevated as a consequence of PMA treatment (Fig. 6B). Maximum levels were observed 12 h after incubation with PMA.

We explored how two isomers of CLA, cis9, trans11-CLA and trans10, cis12-CLA, affected lipid and glucose metabolism, as well as hepatic protein expression, in apolipoprotein E knockout mice. After 12 wk of intervention, plasma triglyceride, NEFA, and glucose concentrations were significantly higher in the trans10, cis12-CLA group, whereas plasma triglyceride, NEFA, glucose, and insulin concentrations were significantly lower in the cis9, trans11-CLA group, compared with control mice consuming linoleic acid. Proteomics identified significant up- or down-regulation of 113 liver cytosolic proteins by either CLA isomer. Principal component analysis revealed that the treatment effect of cis9, trans11-CLA was mainly explained by the up-regulation of different posttranslational forms of heat shock protein 70 kD. In contrast, the treatment effect of trans10, cis12-CLA was mainly explained by up-regulation of key enzymes in the gluconeogenic, beta-oxidation, and ketogenesic pathways. Correlation analysis again emphasized the divergent effects of both CLA isomers on different pathways, but also revealed a linkage between insulin resistance and increased levels of hepatic serotransferrin. Thus, our systems biology approach provided novel insights into the mechanisms by which individual CLA isomers differentially affect pathways related to atherogenesis, such as insulin resistance and inflammation."

Our previous Raman measurements have identified the trans-enamine species for both inhibitors and were used to guide the soaking time and concentration to achieve full occupancy of the active sites. The two inhibitor-bound x-ray structures revealed a linear trans-enamine intermediate covalently attached to the active site Ser-70 residue. This intermediate was thought to play a key role in the transient inhibition of class A β-lactamases. Both the Raman and x-ray data indicated that the clavulanic acid intermediate is decarboxylated. When compared with our previously determined tazobactam-bound inhibitor structure, our new inhibitor-bound structures revealed an increased disorder in the tail region of the inhibitors as well as in the enamine skeleton. The x-ray crystallographic observations correlated with the broadening of the O-C=C-N (enamine) symmetric stretch Raman band near 1595 cm-1. Band broadening in the sulbactam and clavulanic acid inter-mediates reflected a heterogeneous conformational population that results from variations of torsional angles in the O-(C=O)-C=C=NH-C skeleton.

Bacterial infections are often treated using β-lactam antibiotics that inhibit the final stages of peptidoglycan synthesis, leading to bacterial cell death. Unfortunately, resistance to β-lactams has emerged as a result of the production of β-lactamases. Bacteria have become resistant to many of these antibiotics, in large part due to bacterial β-lactamase production and mutation of these enzymes (EC 3.5.2.6) (1Helfand M.S. Bonomo R.A. Curr.

The antibiotic resistance conferred by β-lactamases can often be circumvented via an effective therapeutic strategy involving the combination of penicillin with a β-lactamase inhibitor. Currently, three β-lactamase inhibitors are available for clinical use: tazobactam, sulbactam, and clavulanic acid (Fig. 1A) (4Lee N. Yuen K.Y. Kumana C.R. Drugs. 2003; 63: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Their mechanism of action is thought to be as follows; after forming a Michaelis-Menten complex, the inhibitors proceed to a covalent acyclic linear molecule that inhibits the enzyme both in a transient and in an irreversible manner (5Therrien C. Levesque R.C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 251-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, β-lactamases evolve to counteract the inhibitors by acquiring point mutations that result in resistance to inhibition, whereas the enzymes maintain sufficient activity to degrade β-lactam antibiotics (5Therrien C. Levesque R.C. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 251-262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bradford P.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 933-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (2009) Google Scholar). To counter the effects of drug resistance, detailed molecular information is needed on the mechanism of inhibition by the β-lactamase inhibitors as well as on the ability of β-lactamase to become resistant to these inhibitors.Of the four classes of β-lactamases, class A enzymes are clinically the most prevalent with SHV-1 and TEM-1 as their major members (1Helfand M.S. Bonomo R.A. Curr. Drug Targets Infect. Disord. 2003; 3: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As stated above, the three β-lactamase inhibitors work by acting as very slow substrates, thereby occupying the active site long enough such that the antibiotics are not degraded before their antibacterial action has been completed. For inhibitor development, it is therefore crucial to understand the catalytic mechanism of β-lactamases such that the length of time the inhibitor spends in the active site can be optimized to enhance its inhibitory efficacy. The mechanism of inhibition of β-lactamases has been of intense study (7Charnas R.L. Fisher J. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 2185-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 8Brenner D.G.

Liu J. Chen Y. Ng L. Hujer A.M. Anderson V.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1547: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).The initial step of the catalytic mechanism of inactivation of SHV-1 is ligand binding (18Hokenson M.J. Cope G.A. Lewis E.R. Oberg K.A. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6538-6545Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) followed by nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon atom by the hydroxyl group of Ser-70, resulting in a covalent acyl intermediate and the opening of the β-lactam ring (Fig. 1B). This step is followed by the opening of the second ring. The latter stage results in the linearization of the inhibitor as an imine intermediate. After isomerization, the intermediate becomes a cis-enamine, which in turn can isomerize to the more stable trans-enamine state. After several hours, the enzyme becomes irreversibly inhibited via covalent modification at position Ser-130 as was previously observed crystallographically (19Kuzin A.P. Nukaga M. Nukaga Y. Hujer A. Bonomo R.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1861-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Prior to our work, crystallographic snapshots of reaction intermediates involving clavulanic acid and tazobactam bound to wild-type β-lactamases (19Kuzin A.P.

Biol. 1992; 224: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and an inhibitor resistant mutant have been obtained (21Sun T. Bethel C.R. Bonomo R.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14111-14117Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Additionally, deacylation-deficient E166A β-lactamase mutants have been used to maximize the possibility of trapping its acyl-enzyme intermediates for crystallographic analysis (22Strynadka N.C. Adachi H. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Sielecki A. Betzel C. Sutoh K. James M.N. Nature. 1992; 359: 700-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 23Ibuka A. Taguchi A. Ishiguro M. Fushinobu S. Ishii Y.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2351-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These important structures were obtained by soaking or co-crystallization experiments carried out in the absence of prior information of the type and amount of intermediate that is present within a crystal at any given time. This information would have aided in choosing the right time point for freezing the crystal to obtain stoichiometric complexes. We recently demonstrated that this important aspect of identifying and tracking intermediates inside protein crystals can be achieved using Raman crystallography (25Helfand M.S. Totir M.A. Carey M.P. Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Carey P.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13386-13392Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Padayatti P.S. Helfand M.S. Totir M.A. Carey M.P. Hujer H.M. Carey P.R. Bonomo R.A. van den Akker F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This new approach pinpointed the maximal presence of a tazobactam trans-enamine intermediate in the deacylation-deficient E166A variant of SHV-1 at about 20-30 min after soaking had started (25Helfand M.S. Totir M.A. Carey M.P. Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Carey P.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13386-13392Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Using these conditions, we were able to obtain the 1.63 Å resolution crystal structure of the stoichiometric complex of tazobactam in the trans-enamine intermediate form bound to this SHV-1 E166A deacylation-deficient variant. We now extend our crystallographic studies to the other two inhibitors, sulbactam and clavulanic acid, and present here their 1.34 and 1.43 Å resolution crystal structures, respectively. Our inhibitor structures, observed in the trans-enamine form, will aid in the molecular understanding of this “waiting room” intermediate that is important for effective β-lactamase inhibition (8Brenner D.G. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 3680-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).MATERIALS AND METHODSCrystals for Raman and x-ray crystallographic analysis of the deacylation-deficient E166A mutant of SHV-1 were obtained as described previously (25Helfand M.S. Totir M.A. Carey M.P. Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Carey P.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13386-13392Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Padayatti P.S. Helfand M.S. Totir M.A. Carey M.P. Hujer H.M. Carey P.R. Bonomo R.A. van den Akker F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Crystals were obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion in which drops of 10-μl volume were prepared using 4 μl of protein solution, 1 μl of 5.6 mm Cymal-6 (Hampton Research), and 5 μl of 20% w/v polyethylene glycol 6000 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0. The reservoir solution contained 20% w/v polyethylene glycol 6000 in 0.1 m HEPES pH 7.0 buffer. Wells were sealed and stored at room temperature, and crystals grew to full size in 2-3 days. Our inhibitor soaking experiments for sulbactam and clavulanate were guided by our previous Raman crystallographic measurements using the deacylation-deficient E166A variant of SHV-1 β-lactamase (25Helfand M.S. Totir M.A. Carey M.P. Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Carey P.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13386-13392Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In particular, the Raman intensity plots in Fig. 2A are used to follow the population of the trans-enamine species. The plots were generated by measuring enamine the integrated intensity of the mode near 1595 cm-1 and proportioning this value to the integrated intensity of the amide I band in the unsubtracted protein spectrum as an internal standard. This procedure was carried out for each point on the plot and has the advantage of correcting for minor changes in crystal position or laser focus that occur during the time plot. The present data are generally similar to those we have published (25Helfand M.S. Totir M.A. Carey M.P. Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Carey P.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13386-13392Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), where we plotted peaks heights without reference to an internal standard. If we make the reasonable assumption that the Raman scattering cross-sections are very similar for the three enamine species, since the enamine skeletons are all the same, we observe that the populations of the clavulanic acid and especially the sulbactam-based intermediates are considerably reduced when compared with the population produced by tazobactam.FIGURE 2A, time dependence of the main trans-enamine peak for the three inhibitors when soaked in crystals of the E166A variant of SHV-1. The Raman intensity is an indication of the population levels of the trans-enamine within the E166A crystal. The data points at each time point are the integrated intensity of the enamine mode near 1595 cm-1, which is standardized to the integrated intensity of the amide I band in the parent protein spectrum, recorded prior to subtraction. B, Raman difference spectra of the E166A β-lactamase crystal with 5 mm tazobactam, clavulanic acid, and sulbactam added to the mother liquor. The vertical bar represents a 5000-photon event. The region shown is a small part of the Raman difference spectra highlighting the region near the trans-enamine peak (∼1595 cm-1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Further analysis of our previously published Raman difference spectra indicated that all three inhibitors, free in solution, have a medium intensity Raman mode near 1400 cm-1 (25Helfand M.S. Totir M.A. Carey M.P. Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Carey P.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13386-13392Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This is due to the symmetric stretching vibration of the -COO- group. For the bound ligands, this feature shifts to about 1375 cm-1 in sulbactam and tazobactam, reflecting non-covalent interactions of the -COO- with active site residues. For clavulanic acid bound to the enzyme, there is no peak in this region, suggesting that the -COO- group is no longer present (25Helfand M.S. Totir M.A. Carey M.P. Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Carey P.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13386-13392Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), an observation reported for a clavulanic acid-bound structure of a different β-lactamase (20Chen C.C. Herzberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Finally, our previous Raman study also indicated that the peak width for the characteristic trans-enamine ∼1595 cm-1 peak varies among the three inhibitors (25Helfand M.S. Totir M.A. Carey M.P. Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Carey P.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13386-13392Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with the peak of tazobactam being the narrowest (Fig. 2B). These spectral peak width features are likely indicative of the degree of order around or near the trans-enamine bonds, as will be discussed later.Sulbactam and clavulanic acid soaking were performed as follows. The Raman measurements led us to change our soaking procedure to increase the presence of the trans-enamine for sulbactam. Instead of the 5 mm, as we used to obtain our previous stoichiometric tazobactam complex structure (26Padayatti P.S. Helfand M.S. Totir M.A. Carey M.P. Hujer H.M. Carey P.R. Bonomo R.A. van den Akker F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we chose a concentration that was close to as high as possible (50 mm) for both sulbactam and clavulanic acid. This also allowed us to decrease the soaking time somewhat in an attempt to avoid the side reactions (such as decarboxylation and other fragmentations) yet still approach full active site occupancy, which we achieved. Therefore, 20-μl drops containing 30% polyethylene glycol 6000 in 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0, with 0.56 mm Cymal-6 and 50 mm sulbactam were used for soaking E166A β-lactamase crystal for 10 min. Note that the time it takes such compounds to completely penetrate SHV-1 β-lactamase crystals is less than 1 min as has been determined previously using Raman (25Helfand M.S. Totir M.A. Carey M.P. Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Carey P.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13386-13392Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Crystals soaked with sulbactam were cryo-protected using mother liquor containing 25% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol for ∼1 min before they were submerged in liquid nitrogen using mounted cryoloops (Hampton Research Inc.). Synchrotron data were collected at the Molecular Biology Consortium, Berkeley, CA (MB-CAT 4.2.2) to a diffraction limit of 1.34 Å resolution (TABLE ONE).TABLE ONEData collection and crystallographic refinement statistics for the sulbactam and clavulanic acid bound structures of the E166A variant of SHV-1 Sulbactam Clavulanic acid Data collection Space group P212121 P212121 Unit cell dimension (Å) a = 49.51, b = 55.31, c = 83.73 a = 49.63, b = 55.20, c = 84.71 Wavelength (Å) 1.0 1.0 Resolution (Å) 27.68−1.34 (1.39−1.34) 14.84−1.43 (1.48−1.43) Redundancy 3.52 3.62 Total no. of reflections 184046 141734 Number of unique reflections 52285 39126 <I/σI> 10.4 (2.9) 23.8 (2.1) R(merge) % 5.8 (37.5) 4.5 (26.7) Completeness % 99.8 (99.7) 88.7 (41.2) Refinement R-factor 17.5% 19.4% Rfree 19.5% 22.6% r.m.s.d. from idealityar.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. r.m.s.d. for bond lengths 0.010 Å 0.010 Å r.m.s.d. for bond angles 1.6° 1.6°a r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation.

After the 5-min time point, crystals were cryo-protected in mother liquor containing 25% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. The data for both complexes were processed with d*TREK (27Pflugrath J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Data statistics are shown in TABLE ONE.RESULTSSulbactam-E166A Complex—The sulbactam-bound structure has been refined at 1.34 Å resolution to give an R-factor of 17.5% and Rfree of 19.5%. The final model includes residues 26-292 in the Ambler numbering convention with 4 side chains with alternative conformations, 264 waters, two Cymal-6 molecules (one complete and the other contains only the hydrocarbon tail), part of a HEPES molecule (as was also observed in other structures of SHV (21Sun T. Bethel C.R. Bonomo R.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14111-14117Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Nukaga M. Mayama K. Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Knox J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 328: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar)), and the sulbactam trans-enamine intermediate. The program PROCHECK (32Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) found that there were 92% of the [phis]-φ angles in the most favored core region of the Ramachandran plot and that the remainder of the residues were in the allowed region.The sulbactam intermediate was observed in the trans-enamine form; the C5-C6 dihedral angle of 188° is even closer to the ideal 180° trans-conformation than the 168° angle observed for the tazobactam intermediate (26Padayatti P.S. Helfand M.S. Totir M.A. Carey M.P. Hujer H.M. Carey P.R. Bonomo R.A. van den Akker F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The omit electron density for the sulbactam atoms immediately adjacent to the bonded Ser-70 Oγ atom (e.g. C7, O8, C6, C5, N4) is quite strong and then weakens for the more distant atoms (Fig. 3). The temperature factor of the tazobactam C7 atom bound to Ser-70 is around 15 Å2 when compared with 28 Å2 for the middle of the linearized sulbactam (N4 atom) and above 50 Å2 for the atoms at the tail end (TABLE TWO). Although the density is much weaker in its tail, sulbactam seems to be making an internal hydrogen bond between its N4 nitrogen and one of the sulfone oxygens, similar to tazobactam (Fig. 3A) (26Padayatti P.S. Helfand M.S. Totir M.A. Carey M.P. Hujer H.M. Carey P.R. Bonomo R.A. van den Akker F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Both sulbactam and tazobactam have the O8 atom situated in the oxyanion hole formed by backbone nitrogen atoms of Ser-70 and Ala-237 (Fig. 4A) (26Padayatti P.S. Helfand M.S. Totir M.A. Carey M.P. Hujer H.M. Carey P.R. Bonomo R.A. van den Akker F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, one of the -COO- atoms of sulbactam is positioned within hydrogen-bonding distance of the amine nitrogen of Asn-132 (Fig. 3A). Occupancy and B-factor refinement indicated that the occupancy of the sulbactam intermediate is 90% or higher.FIGURE 3A, electron density of sulbactam.

The only noticeable difference is that the side chain of Asn-170 is in two alternate conformations, an “outward” conformation similar to that observed in our tazobactam-soaked structure and an “inward” conformation similar to wild-type SHV-1 (33Kuzin A.P. Nukaga M. Nukaga Y. Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Knox J.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5720-5727Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Both side chain conformations for Asn-170 in the sulbactam structure showed weak density for the side chain amide groups. Therefore, the precise conformation of these groups could not be fully resolved.Clavulanate-E166A Complex—The clavulanic acid structure has been refined at 1.43 Å resolution to an R-factor of 19.4% and an Rfree of 22.6%. The final model contains residues 26-292, of which 4 have side chains with alternative conformations. In addition, there were 316 waters, and as seen in the sulbactam crystal, one full and one partial Cymal-6 molecule, part of a HEPES molecule, and the trans-enamine intermediate of a decarboxylated clavulanic acid. The trans-enamine torsion angle for clavulanic acid of 181° was very close to ideal. The omit density for clavulanic acid shows a similar trend as sulbactam with strong density near atoms C7, O8, C6, and C5, and then the density tapers off between the bond N4-C3 with only weak density for the remaining atoms (Fig. 3B). In the Raman spectrum of the complex, the characteristic -COO- symmetric stretch near 1375 cm-1 is absent (25Helfand M.S. Totir M.A. Carey M.P. Hujer A.M. Bonomo R.A. Carey P.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13386-13392Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting that decarboxylation has occured. Consistent with this conclusion, the omit density for the clavulanic acid intermediate suggests that the carboxyl group attached to the C3 position had been lost during its reaction within the β-lactamase crystal (Fig. 1, reaction scheme). This decarboxylated intermediate species of clavulanic acid has been previously observed by mass spectroscopy in TEM-2 (16Brown R.P. Aplin R.T. Schofield C.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12421-12432Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and by x-ray crystallography in the Staphylococcus aureus PC1 β-lactamase structure (20Chen C.C. Herzberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 1103-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although we have modeled the decarboxylated clavulanic acid such that it contains the same number of atoms as when bound to PC1, albeit in a different conformation, we do realize that the weak density in the tail of clavulanic acid could also be due to the partial presence of shorter (hydrolyzed) fragments of clavulanic acid intermediates that appear after longer time periods (34Sulton D. Pagan-Roderiguez D. Zhou X. Liu Y. Hujer A.M. Bethel C.R. Helfand M.S. Thomson J.M. Anderson V.E. Buynak J.D. Ng L.M. Bonomo R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 10.1074/jbc.M501251200PubMed Google Scholar), although these would likely yield markedly different Raman spectra. The temperature factors range from 15 Å2 for the covalent attached C7, to about 40 Å2 for its N4 atom, to a maximum of about 55 Å2 for the tail atoms of clavulanic acid (TABLE TWO). Clavulanic acid makes relatively few interactions except for its N4 atom, which forms a water-mediated interaction with the nitrogen atom of the Asn-132 side chain and its O8 atom participating in the usual oxyanion hole interactions (Fig. 3B). Similar to sulbactam, the B-factor and occupancy refinement also suggested the occupancy of the clavulanic acid intermediate is greater than 90%.The active site of the clavulanic acid-bound structure was quite unchanged when compared with the sulbactam- and tazobactam-bound E166A structures. A minor change is that the Asn-170 residue, when compared with the tazobactam-bound structure, is observed in"
https://openalex.org/W2059000354,"In birds and other vertebrates, most acoustic signals are produced pneumatically by moving air through a vocal apparatus. Here we describe a unique mechanism used to produce a tonal acoustic signal in vertebrates. Video recordings of the courtship displays of male Club-winged Manakins, Machaeropterus deliciosus, reveal that males produce sustained harmonic tones through interactions among oscillating secondary wing feathers. This mechanism of sound production shows morphological and mechanistic convergence with arthropod stridulation. Intersexual selection for production of a nonvocal courtship song has led to major morphological, functional, and likely physiological modifications in the wing of this flying bird."

 is a defense of existing, embattled U.S. legislative policy toward ending overfishing and rebuilding depleted populations within a specified time frame. The United States now uniquely has numerous marine species whose recovering populations are linkable to federal rebuilding mandates. Yet lawsuits and congressional bills introduced at the behest of the fishing industry would relax or eliminate the law9s recovery mandates. We show quantitatively that the existing timetable is responsible, reasonable, and biologically feasible."
https://openalex.org/W2004184092,"The CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPβ) plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression during cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. We previously showed that C/EBPβ participates in cGMP-regulated transcription of c-fos in osteoblasts (Chen, Y., Zhuang, S., Cassenaer, S., Casteel, D. E., Gudi, T., Boss, G. R., and Pilz, R. B. (2003) Mol. Cell. Biol. 23, 4066–4082). In the present work, we show that cGMP/cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) induced dephosphorylation and activation of C/EBPβ by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Phosphorylation of GSK-3β on Ser9 negatively regulates the enzyme activity, and we found that PKG phosphorylated this site both in vitro and in vivo; the in vivo phosphorylation occurred rapidly and preceded C/EBPβ dephosphorylation. Previous studies with GSK-3 inhibitors suggest that GSK-3β is a C/EBPβ kinase in resting cells. We determined that GSK-3β phosphorylated C/EBPβ in vitro on Thr189, Ser185, Ser181, and Ser177; C/EBPβ was phosphorylated on these same sites in intact, unstimulated osteoblasts, and phosphorylation was decreased in cGMP-treated cells. Mutation of the GSK-3 phosphorylation sites in C/EBPβ prevented C/EBPβ phosphorylation in resting cells, enhanced C/EBPβ DNA binding, and led to increased target gene transactivation, mimicking the stimulatory effects of cGMP on C/EBPβ. cGMP regulation of C/EBPβ was disrupted by a mutant GSK-3β(Ala9) resistant to cGMP/PKG phosphorylation and inhibition. We conclude that cGMP increases the DNA binding potential of C/EBPβ by preventing the negative effects of GSK-3 phosphorylation.

Thus, cGMP signaling is important for both bone development and homeostasis. Regulation of gene expression by cGMP has been recognized relatively recently, with gene expression profiling contributing to the rapidly growing list of cGMP-regulated genes (11Pilz R.B. Broderick K.E. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 1239-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In a variety of cultured cells and primary tissues, NO donors, natriuretic peptides, or membrane-permeable cGMP analogs induce rapid increases in c-fos, junB, and/or egr-1 mRNA expression (11Pilz R.B.

We and others have shown that cGMP and calcium synergistically stimulate c-fos promoter activity in osteoblasts and neuronal cells and that this effect is mediated more efficiently by PKG II than PKG I (12Gudi T.

We found that C/EBPβ phosphorylation was decreased in cGMP-treated cells, whereas C/EBPβ-dependent transcriptional activity was increased, suggesting regulation of C/EBPβ function by cGMP-dependent dephosphorylation, involving cGMP inhibition of a C/EBPβ kinase and/or activation of a phosphatase (13Chen Y.

Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine protein kinase active in unstimulated cells; GSK-3 activity can be suppressed through phosphorylation residueof an N-terminal (Ser21 and Ser9 serine in the GSK-3α and -3β isoforms, respectively) (31Cohen P.

We hypothesized that GSK-3 might be responsible for constitutive C/EBPβ phosphorylation in resting osteoblasts and that down-regulation of GSK-3 activity by cGMP/PKG could explain the decreased C/EBPβ phosphorylation in cGMP-treated cells.

Some in vitro phosphorylation experiments were performed with Myc epitope-tagged wild type and mutant C/EBPβ proteins expressed in UMR106 cells. Cells were transfected with 1 μg of C/EBPβ expression vector per 6-well dish, C/EBPβ was isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc antibody, and precipitates were washed in kinase assay buffer and incubated with purified GSK-3β and [γ-32PO4]ATP.

Anti-Myc immunoprecipitates were isolated and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with either buffer alone (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.9) or buffer plus 5 units of calf intestinal phosphatase (New England Biolabs), in the presence or absence of the phosphatase inhibitors β-glycerolphosphate (10 mm), NaF (10 mm), and imidazole (2 mm). In Vivo Phosphorylation of C/EBPβ—UMR106 cells were either left untransfected or transfected in 6-well dishes with 50 ng of PKG II and 20 ng of wild type C/EBPβ, mutant C/EBPβ, or pXJ40-Myc empty vector as indicated. Forty h after transfection, cells were transferred to phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 1 h and labeled for 4 h with 32PO4 (100 μCi/6-well dish), with 250 μm 8-CPT-cGMP added to some cultures for the last 1 h. Cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with either a C/EBPβ-specific antibody (see Fig. 3) or anti-Myc antibody (see Fig. 4), and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, electroblotting, and autoradiography. The amount of C/EBPβ present in the immunoprecipitates was determined by blotting with an anti-C/EBPβ antibody.FIGURE 4Analysis of C/EBPβ phosphorylation site mutants.A, the domain structure of C/EBP proteins.

The serine-rich region of rat C/EBPβ (amino acid residues 171–194), including a putative GSK-3 consensus sequence ((S/T)XXX(S/T)XXX(S/T)) is enlarged; a homologous region of C/EBPα is shown below, which contains three sites phosphorylated by GSK-3 (in boldface type) (34Ross S.E.

The sequence of the C/EBPβ serine-rich region is identical in the rat, mouse, and human protein (Thr189 in rat C/EBPβ corresponds to Thr188 in the mouse and Thr235 in the human protein). B, wild type (WT; lane 1) and mutant C/EBPβ proteins with the indicated amino acid substitutions (lanes 2–5) were purified from bacteria, and equal amounts of protein were incubated with purified GSK-3β and [γ-32PO4]ATP as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phosphorylation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (top). Unphosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (bottom).

This synergistic effect is dependent on PKG activity, is enhanced more by transfection of PKG II than PKG I, and requires cooperation between C/EBPβ and CREB, with cGMP and calcium regulating C/EBPβ and CREB activity, respectively (13Chen Y.

In C6 glioma cells, cGMP induces dephosphorylation of C/EBPβ, suggesting that cGMP/PKG regulate the activity of a C/EBPβ kinase or phosphatase (13Chen Y. Zhuang S. Cassenaer S. Casteel D.E. Gudi T.

GSK-3 is a candidate kinase, because GSK-3 is active in unstimulated cells, its activity is down-regulated by multiple signal transduction pathways, and GSK-3 can phosphorylate C/EBPα and -β in vitro (34Ross S.E.

To investigate the potential role of GSK-3 in mediating the effects of cGMP on C/EBPβ, we examined whether PKG activation induces GSK-3 phosphorylation on a regulatory site that inhibits GSK-3 activity (i.e. Ser9 on GSK-3β) (31Cohen P.

The local environment of S4 is still unknown, even regarding the basic question as to whether S4 is close to the pore domain. Relying on the ability of functional KAT1 channels to rescue potassium (K+) transport-deficient yeast, we have performed an unbiased mutagenesis screen aimed at determining whether S4 packs against S5 of the pore domain. Starting with semilethal mutations of surface-exposed S5 residues of the KAT1 pore domain, we have screened randomly mutagenized libraries of S4 or S1–S3 for second-site suppressors. Our study identifies two S4 residues that interact in a highly specific manner with two S5 residues in the middle of the membrane-spanning regions, supporting a model in which the S4 voltage sensor packs against the pore domain in the hyperpolarized, or “down,” state of S4."
https://openalex.org/W2058657406,"Six Cys2His2 zinc fingers (F1–6) comprise the DNA binding domain of metal-responsive element binding transcription factor-1 (MTF-1). F1–6 is necessary for basal and zinc-induced expression of metallothionein genes. Analysis of NMR structural and dynamic data for an F1–6 protein construct demonstrates that each zinc finger adopts a stable ββα fold in the presence of stoichiometric Zn(II), provided that all cysteine ligands are in a reduced state. Parallel studies of protein constructs spanning the four N-terminal core DNA binding fingers (F1–4) and two C-terminal low DNA affinity fingers (F5–6) reveal similar stable zinc finger structures. In both the F1–6 and F5–6 proteins, the finger 5 cysteines were found to readily oxidize at neutral pH. Detailed spectral density and hydrodynamic analysis of 15N relaxation data revealed quasi-ordered anisotropic rotational diffusion properties of the six F1–6 zinc fingers that could influence MTF-1 DNA binding function. A more general effect on the rotational diffusion properties of Cys2His2 zinc fingers was also uncovered that is dependent upon the position of each finger within multifinger domains. Analysis of NMR 1H-15N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectral peak intensities measured as a function of added Zn(II) in conjunction with Zn(II) binding modeling studies indicated that the Zn(II) affinities of all MTF-1 zinc fingers are within ∼10–50-fold. These analyses further suggested that metal sensing by MTF-1 in eukaryotic cells involves multiple zinc fingers and occurs over a 100-fold or less range of accessible Zn(II) concentration. Six Cys2His2 zinc fingers (F1–6) comprise the DNA binding domain of metal-responsive element binding transcription factor-1 (MTF-1). F1–6 is necessary for basal and zinc-induced expression of metallothionein genes.

These analyses further suggested that metal sensing by MTF-1 in eukaryotic cells involves multiple zinc fingers and occurs over a 100-fold or less range of accessible Zn(II) concentration. Organisms ranging from bacteria to mammals maintain intracellular Zn(II) levels within a functional range through homeostatic mechanisms that include metal-dependent regulation of gene expression. It has recently been proposed that the high Zn(II) binding affinities reported for the bacterial Zur and ZntR proteins suggest that Zn(II) homeostasis in Escherichia coli is tightly regulated, such that essentially no labile or “accessible” cytoplasmic Zn(II) is available (1.Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). In this model, Zn(II) substitution reactions between Zur and ZntR and as yet unidentified metal chaperone transporters could mediate the metal response. In higher eukaryotic organisms, multiple homeostatic mechanisms regulate intracellular Zn(II) levels (2.Andrews G.K. Biometals. 2001; 14: 223-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 3.Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. Biometals. 2001; 14: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). However, the accessible concentration range over which Zn(II) is regulated in eukaryotic cells is unknown. In higher eukaryotic organisms, Zn(II)-inducible expression of genes encoding for the zinc transporter-1 and cysteine-rich metallothionein class of proteins is mediated through the metal-responsive element binding transcription factor-1 (MTF-1) 1The abbreviations used are: MTF-1, metal-responsive element binding transcription factor-1; mMTF-1, mouse MTF-1; F1–6, DNA binding domain of MTF-1 containing six Cys2His2 zinc fingers; F1–4, four N-terminal zinc fingers of MTF-1; F5–6, two C-terminal zinc fingers of MTF-1; MRE, metal-responsive DNA promoter element; 15N-{1H}-NOE, steady-state 15N-{1H}-heteronuclear nuclear Overhauser enhancement; BME, β-mercaptoethanol; U-, uniform isotopic enrichment (>98%); HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; MOPS, 3-(4-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; d13-MES, deuterated 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; R1, longitudinal relaxation time constant; R2, transverse relaxation time constant; τm, rotational correlation time; TF1–3, the three N-terminal zinc fingers of TFIIIA from Xenopus laevis; WT1–4, the four zinc fingers from the human Wilms tumor suppressor protein. shown schematically in Fig. 1.

Mouse MTF-1 (mMTF-1) is a 75-kDa, 675-amino acid protein that contains a six-Cys2His2 zinc finger DNA binding domain (F1–6) (11.Miller J. McLachlan A.D. Klug A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1609-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar) and three distinct transcriptional activation domains (Fig. 1). With the exception of the Drosophila protein, 92% sequence identity exists between all other known orthologs of MTF-1 in the zinc finger domain (8.Auf der Mauer A. Belser T. Elgar G. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 175-185PubMed Google Scholar). The human and mouse MTF-1 zinc finger domains differ by a single amino acid. By contrast, considerable sequence divergence occurs in the remaining domains of MTF-1. The high sequence conservation of the MTF-1 DNA binding domain is consistent with a proposed Zn(II) regulatory role. Transcriptional specificity of MTF-1 is mediated through F1–6, which recognizes a metal-responsive DNA promoter element (MRE). The minimal MRE consensus sequence is TGCRCnC on the 5′-end of a larger 12-base pair site that contains a loosely conserved GC-rich region on the 3′-end (12.Stuart G.W. Searle P.F. Chen H.Y.

Although variable in orientation, MREs are often found in multiple copies within the proximal promotor sites of target genes. Multiple lines of evidence point to zinc finger metal coordination as an essential mechanistic contributor to Zn(II)-dependent activation of MTF-1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays on nuclear extracts from various higher eukaryotic cell lines demonstrated that MTF-1 binding to the MRE is reversibly activated by the presence of 30 μm Zn(II) at 30–37 °C (6.Otsuka F.

These and other experimental observations led to an estimation of in vitro Zn(II)-responsive MRE binding by MTF-1 as being in the low micromolar range (6.Otsuka F. Iwamatsu A. Suzuki K. Ohsawa M.

Because these in vitro systems contained numerous other Zn(II)-binding proteins in relatively high concentration, a quantitative estimation of the Zn(II) affinities of the MTF-1 zinc fingers from these studies was not possible. However, recent Co(II) affinity measurements of each MTF-1 zinc finger in the context of the full-length F1–6 DNA binding domain reported all Kds to be in the 20–100 nm range (19.Guerrerio A.L. Berg J.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5437-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). MTF-1 can act as a heterologous Zn(II)-responsive transcriptional activator in yeast, which has no chromosomal MTF-1 gene (20.Bittel D.C. Smirnova I.V. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37194-37201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Similarly, Zn(II)-responsive activation of gene expression mediated by indigenous MRE sites was recently demonstrated using a transfected D. melanogaster MTF-1 gene (7.Zhang B. Egli D. Georgiev O. Schaffner W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4505-4514Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Exposure of mammalian cells to Zn(II) also results in rapid nuclear translocation of MTF-1. Very recent in vivo studies in mammalian cells suggest that additional Zn(II) binding sites within a cysteine-rich C-terminal region of MTF-1 may also contribute to MTF-1 activity (21.Chen X.H. Zhang B. Harmon P.M. Schaffner W. Peterson D.O. Giedroc D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4515-4522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Structural and functional studies of MTF-1 zinc fingers have reported conflicting observations relating to which fingers are responsible for metal sensing and whether all fingers adopt stable canonical ββα structures (20.Bittel D.C.

Physiol. 2000; 185: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). CD spectra at 222 nm were reported to be essentially identical for MTF-1 F1–6 proteins with 3.5 and 5.5 equivalents of Zn(II) (23.Chen X. Agarwal A. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11152-11161Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This result suggested to the authors that two or three of the fingers do not adopt the predicted folded structures. An NMR study of the three C-terminal fingers of MTF-1 (F4–6) reported that fingers 4 and 6 adopt stable canonical folds in contrast to finger 5, which was reported to have only a fractional population of the ββα folded form in the presence of stoichiometric quantities of Zn(II) (24.Giedroc D.P. Chen X. Pennella M.A. LiWang A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42322-42332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, this putative finger 5 instability appears to be inconsistent with the submicromolar Co(II) binding Kd measured for finger 5 (19.Guerrerio A.L. Berg J.M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5437-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). DNA binding studies have provided evidence that the four N-terminal MTF-1 fingers (F1–4) are the core MRE binding group, whereas the C-terminal fingers (F5–6) have been proposed to be regulatory Zn(II)-sensing fingers that stabilize DNA complex formation (22.Chen X. Chu M. Giedroc D.P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12915-12925Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A different picture of Zn(II) sensing by MTF-1 has emerged from functional studies that suggest zinc finger 1 may be a regulatory finger, whereas fingers 5 and 6 may be necessary for transcriptional function in the context of the chromatin complex (25.Jiang H.M. Daniels P.J. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30394-30402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In vivo studies using MRE-driven reporters in dko7 (MTF-1-/-), Drosophila SL2, and yeast cell lines demonstrated that finger 1, but not fingers 5 and 6, of MTF-1 was needed for Zn(II)-inducible activation of DNA binding and subsequent gene expression (20.Bittel D.C. Smirnova I.V. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37194-37201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A role for the N-terminal fingers of MTF-1 in Zn(II)-responsive transcriptional activity has also been reported by Koizumi et al. (26.Koizumi S. Suzuki K. Ogra Y. Gong P. Otuska F. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 185: 464-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In vitro DNA binding of MTF-1 was also shown to be activated in a in vitro transcription translation-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (TnT) lysate in the presence of 5–15 μm Zn(II) at 37 °C from undetectable levels without added Zn(II) (20.Bittel D.C. Smirnova I.V. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37194-37201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Deletion mutants of MTF-1 missing finger 1 exhibited constitutive, albeit poor, DNA binding in the absence of exogenous Zn(II) and were not further activated upon the addition of more Zn(II). By contrast, no significant difference in Zn(II) induction or relative MRE binding activities was observed in identical assays of mutant proteins in which finger 5 or fingers 5 and 6 were deleted from the MTF-1 zinc finger domain. To reconcile conflicting structural and metal binding observations and to gain insights into the higher eukaryotic cellular Zn(II)-responsive range, we have characterized the structure, dynamics, and Zn(II) binding properties of all six MTF-1 zinc fingers (F1–6). Chemical shift, 3JHN-Hα scalar coupling, and 15N-{1H}-NOE dynamics NMR measurements clearly demonstrate that each Cys2His2 domain of MTF-1 adopts a stable ββα structure at submillimolar protein concentrations in the presence of 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol (BME) and stoichiometric quantities of Zn(II). Parallel studies show that the four N-terminal (F1–4) and two C-terminal (F5–6) zinc fingers of MTF-1 also form stable structures that are similar to those of the same fingers in the context of the full-length F1–6 DNA binding domain. An unusual tendency of zinc finger 5 toward cysteine oxidation is also reported. 15N relaxation measurements and subsequent spectral density and hydrodynamic analyses reveal that the rotational diffusion properties of F1–6 are relatively well correlated (quasi-ordered) compared with several other multizinc finger proteins, which suggests inter-finger interactions could play a functional role in MTF-1 DNA binding. Position-specific effects on the rotational diffusion motions of zinc fingers that are likely general phenomena of the Cys2His2 class of zinc fingers are also reported. Titration experiments monitored by 1H-15N-HSQC spectra peak intensities combined with theoretical binding studies also suggest that the Zn(II) affinities of all six MTF-1 fingers are within ∼10–50-fold. These results are also consistent with a eukaryotic MTF-1 metalloregulatory mechanism involving multiple zinc fingers that occurs over a 100-fold or less concentration range of accessible Zn(II). Plasmid Construction and Expression—cDNA encoding residues 136–312 that encompass F1–6 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a murine expressed sequence tag clone 1528077 (American Type Culture Collection). The DNA primers used for PCR amplification also incorporated the XbaI-NdeI region of pET21a(+) (Novagen) and an EcoRI restriction site onto the 5′- and 3′-ends of the gene, respectively. Gel-purified PCR fragments were digested and subsequently ligated into the XbaI and EcoRI sites of pET-21a(+) to form the expression vector pMZF1–6. DNA constructs coding for mMTF-1 F1–4 (pMZF1–4, residues 136–252) and F5–6 (pMZF5–6, residues 257–312) were constructed using the same cloning strategy. Data provided by the University of Kansas Medical Center Biotechnology Support Facility or the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Biological Sciences Genomics Facility were used to verify all plasmid DNA sequences in both strand directions. Expression and Purification of F1–6, F1–4, and F5–6—DNA plasmids coding MTF-1 zinc finger proteins F1–6 or F1–4 were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3), from which a single colony was used to inoculate 20 ml of Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with 200 μg/ml ampicillin. After overnight growth, gently centrifuged cells were resuspended into 1 liter of minimal medium (1.28% Na2HPO4, 0.3% KH2PO4, 0.05% NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2) containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, trace metals, and 10 mg/liter thiamine. Uniform (U) isotopic enrichment of the medium was obtained by using 1 g/liter U-15NH4Cl and either 2 g/liter unlabeled glucose or 2 g/liter U-[13C] glucose when producing U-[15N]- or U-[15N,13C]-labeled protein, respectively. Cultures were grown at 37 °C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.6, induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, supplemented with an additional 50 μm ZnSO4, and grown overnight (∼16 h). Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7, 50 μm ZnSO4, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Triton X-100). Resuspended cells were then lysed by sonication whereby the soluble and insoluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 30 min (Sorvall SS-34 rotor). The soluble fraction was discarded, and the insoluble fraction containing the zinc finger inclusion body proteins was solubilized with 7 m guanidine hydrochloride, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7, and 200 mm dithiothreitol. The solubilized protein solution was centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 60 min (Sorvall SS-34 rotor) and diluted 100-fold directly into 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid and 10% CH3CN. This protein solution was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm (Sorvall SS-34 rotor) for 30 min at 4 °C to remove precipitated cellular materials. This solution was then passed through a 0.2-μm filter and loaded onto a preparative 40 × 100-mm Waters Delta-Pak 300-Å pore size C18 high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column pre-equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and 20% CH3CN. A linear 20–50% CH3CN gradient was applied to the column at 1.5%/min, whereby the MTF-1 zinc finger proteins eluted at ∼30–37% CH3CN. Pure fractions of the eluted protein were screened by analytical high performance liquid chromatography, pooled, quantitated by ultraviolet absorbance at 280 nm (Varian Cary100), and lyophilized. Expression and purification of F5–6 protein was identical to F1–6 and F1–4 except for the following protocol changes: cells were grown at 20 °C and harvested 3–5 h postinduction. F5–6 protein was localized in the soluble portion of the cell lysate, which was isolated and adjusted to contain 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid and 5% CH3CN for high performance liquid chromatography purification as described. A linear 5–45% CH3CN gradient was applied to the column at 1.5%/min. Protein extinction coefficients and concentration determinations for zinc titration experiments were determined by amino acid analysis at the W. M. Keck Facility at Yale University. A purity of >95% was estimated for each protein sample using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and analytical high performance liquid chromatography. Mass spectrometry confirmed essentially complete 15N and 13C isotopic enrichment of the MTF-1 zinc finger proteins (University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Biological Sciences Proteomics Facility). Undetectable residual Zn(II) levels from 100 μm MTF-1 protein samples as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Varian AA400, ∼1 ppm Zn(II) threshold) corresponded to <0.1 molar equivalent Zn(II)/mole zinc finger protein (F1–6, F1–4, and F5–6) in all apo preparations. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR samples were prepared from lyophilized protein that was dissolved in argon-saturated d13-MES, pH 6.9, with 5% D2O (or 99% D2O for 13C-NOESY-HSQC experiments), 5 mm BME, 0.2 mm 3-(trimethylsiyl)-1-propane-sulfonic acid, and 1 mm NaN3. MTF-1 zinc finger NMR samples were treated with 1.05 molar equivalents of Zn(II)/zinc finger except for those apo protein samples used in titrations. All MTF-1 zinc finger protein concentrations were 0.7–1.0 mm except for F5–6, which was soluble to ∼0.3 mm. NMR sample tubes were equilibrated with argon prior to sealing with an airtight cap. All NMR data collected for these studies originated from a 14.1 T Varian Inova spectrometer (599.7 MHz for 1H, 150.8 MHz for 13C, and 60.8 MHz for 15N) equipped with either a conventional or cryogenically cooled (1H, 13C, 15N) triple resonance probe. NMR spectra described below were recorded at 30 °C for F1–6 and 20 °C for F1–4 and F5–6. Standard double and triple resonance spectra were used to assign the backbone 1HN, 15NH, 13C, and side chain 13Cβ resonances for F1–6, F1–4, and F5–6 (27.Pelton J.G. Wemmer D.E. Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem. 1995; 46: 139-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, 1H-15N-HSQC, HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCA, HNCO, and (HCA)CO(CA)NH spectra were recorded using water flip-back methods (28.Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12594Google Scholar, 29.Kay L.E. Xu G.Y. Yamazaki T. J. Magn. Reson. Series A. 1994; 109: 129-133Crossref Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and/or 15N gradient coherence selection with sensitivity enhancement (30.Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Reson. Series B. 1994; 103: 203-216Crossref Scopus (839) Google Scholar) for solvent suppression. Aliphatic side chain assignments of F1–6 were obtained from three-dimensional CT-HCCH-COSY, HCCH-TOCSY, using mixing times of 100 ms. Additional aliphatic and aromatic F1–6 side chain information was obtained from three-dimensional 15N- and 13C-NOESY-HSQC experiments (150-ms mixing times), the latter of which was recorded twice with the carbon frequency centered on the aliphatic and aromatic regions. Scalar 3JHN-Hα coupling constants for F1–6 were calculated from a three-dimensional HNHA spectrum using a homo-nuclear HN-Hα 3J-coupling dephasing delay (ξ) of 12.5 ms as described by Vuister and Bax (31.Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Crossref Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). For all of the NMR spectra, the proton carrier was set to the water frequency to reduce the amplitude of spurious water echoes. In general, 512 complex points were acquired in the direct 1H dimension, while 128, 45, and 45 complex increments were recorded where appropriate for the 1H, 13C, and 15N indirect dimensions, respectively. All NMR data processing and analysis was carried out with the NMRPipe and NMRView software packages, respectively (32.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar, 33.Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar). Forward linear prediction was used in all spectra recorded with constant time evolution to double the time domain. All indirect dimensions of these NMR spectra were zero filled to 256 complex points and apodized with a 90°-shifted sinebell-squared window function prior to Fourier transformation. The standard approach used to assign all MTF-1 zinc finger proteins involved correlating intra-(i) and inter-residue (i-1) 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 13CO resonances to the corresponding backbone 1HN-15NH resonances through scalar couplings for each non-proline amino acid sequentially in the protein (34.Leopold M.F. Urbauer J.L. Wand A.J. Mol. Biotechnol. 1994; 2: 61-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The independent assignment of 13Cα/β and 13CO resonances was useful for clarifying ambiguous residue connections that are common in identical residue positions of repeating zinc finger motifs. Backbone 13Cα and 13CO random coil values have been reported previously (35.Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Holm A. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar, 36.Braun D. Wider G. Wuthrich K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 8466-8469Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Referencing for 1H was internal relative to 3-(trimethylsiyl)-1-propane-sulfonic acid, whereas 15N and 13C referencing was external according to standard procedures (37.Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2083) Google Scholar). All MTF-1 zinc finger backbone and side chain NMR resonance assignments have been deposited in the Biomagnetic Resonance Data Bank. F1–6, F1–4, and F5–6 15N-{1H}-NOE measurements, 15N longitudinal (R1) and transverse (R2) relaxation time constants were measured by the steady-state, inversion-recovery and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill methods, respectively (38.Palmer III, A.G. Cavanagh J. Wright P.E. Rance M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 151-170Google Scholar, 39.Stone M.J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer III, A.G. Reizer J. Saier Jr., M.H. Wright P.E.

All 15N relaxation spectra were recorded as 128 × 512 complex matrices, with 8 (R1 and R2) or 16 (15N-{1H}-NOE) scans/t1 point and spectral widths of 8000 and 2200 Hz in the 1H and 15N dimensions, respectively. Indirect dimensions were zero filled to 256 complex points and apodized with a 90°-shifted sinebell-squared window function prior to Fourier transformation. The R1 and R2 spectra were collected with relaxation delays as follows: F1–6, R1 delays of 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09, 0.12, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.35, 0.50, 0.65, 0.90, 1.00, 1.25, and 1.50 s and R2 delays of 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09, 0.11, 0.13, 0.15, 0.17, and 0.19 s; F1–4, R1 delays of 0.03, 0.05, 0.09, 0.12, 0.20, 0.35, 0.50, 0.70, 1.20, and 1.60 s and R2 delays of 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09, 0.11, 0.13, 0.15, 0.17, 0.21, and 0.25 s; F5–6, R1 delays of 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.11, 0.15, 0.20, 0.35, 0.50, 0.65, 0.80, 1.0, and 1.25 s and R2 delays of 0.01, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.09, 0.11, 0.15, 0.19, 0.23, 0.27, 0.31, and 0.35 s. These spectra typically included one or more multiple R1 and R2 data sets that were used to estimate the precision of the peak intensities. Similarly, at least three interleaved steady-state 15N-{1H}-NOE experiments were collected with and without 1H saturation to allow for estimation of experimental uncertainty. A recovery delay of 5 s was used for all 15N relaxation experiments. The R1 and R2 time constants were calculated as two parameter exponential decay curves described by I(t) = I0e-tR, where I(t) is the measured peak intensity as a function of the known relaxation delay time t, I0 is the fitted initial peak intensity at t = 0, and R is the calculated 15N relaxation time constant (R1 or R2). All exponential data curves were fitted with the program CurveFit1.30 (A. G. Palmer, III, Columbia University, New York, NY). Spectral Density Mapping—Reduced spectral densi"
https://openalex.org/W2072327473,"This study determined the effects of increased intracellular cAMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation on endothelial cell basal and thrombin-induced isometric tension development. Elevation of cAMP and maximal cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation induced by 10 μm forskolin, 40 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine caused a 50% reduction in myosin II regulatory light chain (RLC) phosphorylation and a 35% drop in isometric tension, but it did not inhibit thrombin-stimulated increases in RLC phosphorylation and isometric tension. Elevation of cAMP did not alter myosin light chain kinase catalytic activity. However, direct inhibition of myosin light chain kinase with KT5926 resulted in a 90% decrease in RLC phosphorylation and only a minimal decrease in isometric tension, but it prevented thrombin-induced increases in RLC phosphorylation and isometric tension development. We showed that elevated cAMP increases phosphorylation of RhoA 10-fold, and this is accompanied by a 60% decrease in RhoA activity and a 78% increase in RLC phosphatase activity. Evidence is presented that it is this inactivation of RhoA that regulates the decrease in isometric tension through a pathway involving cofilin. Activated cofilin correlates with increased F-actin severing activity in cell extracts from monolayers treated with forskolin/3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Pretreatment of cultures with tautomycin, a protein phosphatase type 1 inhibitor, blocked the effect of cAMP on 1) the dephosphorylation of cofilin, 2) the decrease in RLC phosphorylation, and 3) the decrease in isometric tension. Together, these data provide in vivo evidence that elevated intracellular cAMP regulates endothelial cell isometric tension and RLC phosphorylation through inhibition of RhoA signaling and its downstream pathways that regulate myosin II activity and actin reorganization.

Endothelial cells lining blood vessels form a continuous layer that constrains proteins and blood elements to the vascular lumen. Disruption of the continuous endothelial barrier leads to an increase in permeability and development of edema, a hallmark of acute and chronic inflammation. Chemical or inflammatory mediators activate signaling pathways that cause endothelial cells to contract forming gaps between adjacent cells leading to an increase in vascular permeability. Several laboratories studying methods to inhibit endothelial cell contraction and vascular permeability have demonstrated that elevation of intracellular cAMP augments barrier function and prevents increases in permeability to a wide range of inflammatory agonists. The primary pathway implicated in preventing increases in permeability is believed to occur through the activation of adenylate cyclase, accumulation of intracellular cAMP, and activation of PKA. 2The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; Fsk, forskolin; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; RLC, regulatory light chain; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; MLCK210, myosin light chain kinase 210-kDa isoform (nonmuscle); MLCK155, myosin light chain kinase 155-kDa isoform (smooth muscle); PAK, p21-activated kinase; BPAE, bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells; RBD, Rho-binding domain; PP1, protein phosphatase type 1; PP2, protein phosphatase type 2; MYPT1, myosin targeting subunit; SSH1L, slingshot phosphatase; BDNF, brain derived neurotrophic factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor, MEM; minimal essential media; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; CaM, calmodulin; ADF, actin depolymerizing factor.2The abbreviations used are: PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; Fsk, forskolin; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; RLC, regulatory light chain; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; MLCK210, myosin light chain kinase 210-kDa isoform (nonmuscle); MLCK155, myosin light chain kinase 155-kDa isoform (smooth muscle); PAK, p21-activated kinase; BPAE, bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cells; RBD, Rho-binding domain; PP1, protein phosphatase type 1; PP2, protein phosphatase type 2; MYPT1, myosin targeting subunit; SSH1L, slingshot phosphatase; BDNF, brain derived neurotrophic factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor, MEM; minimal essential media; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; CaM, calmodulin; ADF, actin depolymerizing factor.

Biol. 1998; 19: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and a decrease in RLC phosphorylation. Nonmuscle MLCK has been shown to contain putative PKA consensus phosphorylation sites, and PKA has been reported to inhibit MLCK activity in vitro. Based on these initial observations, it has been inferred that the enhanced barrier function induced by cAMP results from PKA phosphorylation of MLCK and inhibition of MLCK activity leading to decreased RLC phosphorylation and endothelial cell relaxation. For the last 15 years there has been considerable controversy regarding the physiological importance of MLCK phosphorylation by PKA. It is clear that cAMP modulates endothelial barrier function and prevents increases in vascular permeability to inflammatory mediators. That barrier protection and inhibition of endothelial cell contraction are a result of PKA phosphorylation of MLCK remains unsubstantiated. The Rho family of GTPases, which includes Cdc42, Rac, and Rho, has been shown to play a pivotal role in dynamic rearrangements of the cytoskeleton. Rho cycles between the GDP-bound inactive state and GTP-bound active state and has been implicated in formation of stress fibers, cell motility, cell adhesion, smooth and nonmuscle cell contraction, neurite retraction, and cell cycle progression (reviewed in Refs. 31Riento K. Ridley A.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 446-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (1536) Google Scholar, 32Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Physiol.

Sci. 2001; 22: 32-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Upon binding to GTP, Rho interacts with and activates multiple downstream effectors such as mDia, Rho kinase, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-kinase, which are involved in actin polymerization, formation of focal adhesion/stress fibers, and cell contraction. RhoA activity is tightly controlled by activating factors such as the guanine nucleotide exchange factors that catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP and by the following inactivating factors: GTPase-activating proteins that enhance hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. In resting cells RhoA is also regulated by RhoGDI (guanosine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor) that binds GDP-Rho and sequesters the complex within the cytoplasm and prevents its activation. In addition, recent evidence has emerged suggesting the PKA/c-GMP-dependent protein kinase pathways act as negative regulators of RhoA function (34Murthy K.S. Zhou H. Grider J.R. Makhlouf G.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G1006-G1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 35Ellerbroek S.M. Wennerberg K. Burridge K. J. Biol.

Rubin E.J. Gill D.M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1087-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) and exerts its effects on cell morphology and F-actin stress fibers. Inhibition of Rho by C3 leads to changes in cell morphology and loss of stress fibers similar to those observed in cells treated with either dibutyryl cAMP or forskolin. These observations led to the hypothesis that cAMP and C3 may share a common pathway. Lang et al. (36Lang P. Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M. Bertoglio J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 510-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) studying the effects of cAMP and C3 on NK cells documented that both agents produced similar effects on cell morphology and motility. This observation led to the demonstration that PKA catalyzes phosphorylation of RhoA on Ser188, and this phosphorylation inhibits RhoA activity establishing an alternative pathway for terminating RhoA signaling. Since these initial reports, studies have confirmed that the RhoA signaling cascade is regulated by PKA phosphorylation establishing an alternative pathway for regulating Rho GTPases (35Ellerbroek S.M. Wennerberg K. Burridge K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19023-19031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 36Lang P. Gesbert F. Delespine-Carmagnat M. Stancou R. Pouchelet M.

Although evidence has accumulated establishing PKA as a modulator of RhoA activity, the downstream effects of PKA inhibition of RhoA remain unidentified. Studies presented in this report characterize the effect of elevated intracellular cAMP on basal and agonist-stimulated isometric tension in confluent endothelial cell monolayers. We provide evidence that in endothelial cells the decrease in RLC phosphorylation and the drop in isometric tension upon elevation of cAMP are not mediated via PKA phosphorylation of MLCK210 but through RhoA inactivation, which alters the activation of effector proteins within the Rho/Rho kinase signaling cascade. Furthermore, evidence is presented showing that both myosin phosphatase and cofilin activity increase in the presence of RhoA inactivation leading to the decrease in RLC phosphorylation, disruption of F-actin, and the drop in endothelial cell isometric tension observed upon elevation of cAMP. Cell Culture—The bovine pulmonary artery endothelial (BPAE) cell line isolated and characterized by Del Vecchio and Smith (39Del Vecchio P.J. Smith J.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1981; 108: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CLL-209). Cells were grown and maintained in minimal essential media (MEM) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. BPAE monolayers used in these studies were 6 days post-confluent. Cell Labeling—BPAE monolayers were washed in phosphate-free MEM containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin and labeled with [32P]orthophosphoric acid as described previously (40Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Monolayers were incubated in low phosphate media containing 10 μm Fsk, 40 μm IBMX (Fsk/IBMX) and 75 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphoric acid for the duration of the experiment. Protein Purification—Recombinant rabbit smooth muscle MLCK (MLCK155) was expressed in SF-9 cells (23Goeckeler Z.M. Masaracchia R.A. Zeng Q. Chew T.L. Gallagher P. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1991; 261: C32-C40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies specific to MLCK155 were generated against purified full-length protein. Antibodies specific to nonmuscle myosin II RLC were generated to recombinant light chain (41Chew T.L. Masaracchia R.A. Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 839-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) coupled to tuberculin PPD (Statens Seriuminstitut, Denmark) with glutaraldehyde. Polyclonal antibodies were raised to purified MLCK155 in New Zealand White rabbits, and the IgG fractions were purified from pooled rabbit serum. MLCK155 antibodies were affinity-purified as described by Goeckeler and Wysolmerski (40Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody raised to chicken gizzard MLCK was purchased from Sigma (M7905; clone K36). Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal cofilin (catalog number 3312) and phosphocofilin (Ser3; catalog number 3311) peptide antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to RhoA (catalog number SC-178) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A phospho-RhoA-Ser188 peptide antibody (catalog number ST1035) was from Calbiochem. Rabbit polyclonal antibody to LIM kinase (catalog number L2290) was from Sigma, and a phospho-LIM kinase 1/2 peptide antibody (catalog number NSB1076) was from Novus Biologicals, Inc. Measurement of Intracellular cAMP and Protein Kinase A Activity—BPAE monolayers grown on 35 × 10-mm dishes were incubated with 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, or 50μm Fsk alone and then with 10μm Fsk and 20, 40, 80, 100, and 500μm or 1 mm IBMX for 10 min. To determine cAMP levels, the cultures were washed with 1 ml of MEM, 0.25% bovine serum albumin containing 40 μm IBMX and flooded with 0.5 ml of working lysis reagent. Samples were processed, and cAMP was measured by using the cAMP Biotrack EIA system (Amersham Biosciences catalog number RPN 225). To measure PKA activity, monolayers were flooded with 100 μl of ice-cold PKA homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris, 25 mm KH2PO4, 25 mm K2HPO4, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm IBMX, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, pH 7.2). PKA activity was measured in supernatants immediately after cell lysis using a protein kinase A assay (Transbio Corp., Baltimore, MD) following the manufacturer's instructions. cAMP concentration and PKA activity were normalized to total protein. Isometric Tension Measurements—Isometric tension measurements were performed as described in detail previously (40Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 43Kolodney M.S. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). BPAE cells were seeded onto precast collagen gels and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Monolayers were confluent within 2-3 days after seeding and used for experiments after basal isometric tension stabilized (5-7 days after confluence). Analysis of Myosin Light Chain Phosphorylation—Myosin II RLC phosphorylation states were separated by urea/glycerol gel electrophoresis (44Perrie W.T. Perry S.V. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Control and treated monolayers were flooded with 1 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid containing 10 mm DTT and processed as described previously (23Goeckeler Z.M. Masaracchia R.A. Zeng Q.

The pellets were dissolved in 80 μlof9.5 m urea, 10 mm DTT, 20 mm Tris, 23 mm glycine, and 0.04% bromphenol blue, pH 8.8. Urea/glycerol PAGE and Western blotting were carried out as described previously (41Chew T.L. Masaracchia R.A. Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 839-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Myosin II RLCs were detected by ECL methodology (Amersham Biosciences). X-ray films were developed at various time intervals to obtain an exposure within the linear range of the films. Myosin RLC quantitation was performed as described previously (40Goeckeler Z.M. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 613-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). MLCK Immunoprecipitation and Activity Measurements—MLCK210 was immunoprecipitated from either [32P]orthophosphoric labeled or unlabeled monolayers with a rabbit polyclonal MLCK antibody (227423) as described previously (23Goeckeler Z.M. Masaracchia R.A. Zeng Q. Chew T.L. Gallagher P. Wysolmerski R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18366-18374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed on 7.5% SDS gels, transferred to PVDF membrane, probed with a mouse monoclonal to gizzard smooth muscle MLCK, and detected by ECL. PVDF membranes were air-dried and exposed to PhosphorImager plates for detection of 32PO4 incorporation in MLCK. To account for differences in recovery of immunopurified MLCK, auto-radiographs and corresponding Western blot ECL films were each quantitated by two-dimensional laser densitometry and MLCK phosphorylation expressed as a ratio of 32PO4 densitometric units to Western blot densitometric units. All values were normalized to untreated controls. To measure catalytic activity, MLCK210 was immunoprecipitated from unlabeled BPAE monolayers treated with 10 μm Fsk, 40 μm IBMX for 5 and 30 min and used in an in vitro phosphorylation assay. Protein G beads containing MLCK210 were resuspended in 50 μl of phosphorylation buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, 1 μm CaM, 5 μm CaCl2, 1 μm RLC) containing 125 μm [γ-32P]ATP and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Assays were terminated by transferring 10 μl of reaction mixture to P81 papers that were immediately immersed in 10% trichloroacetic acid, 2% Na4P2O7 for 10 min. The papers were washed in 1% trichloroacetic acid, 2% Na4P2O7, and the phosphorylated product was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. The amount of immunopurified kinase in each reaction mixture was quantitated by Western blot using an affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal MLCK155 antibody. Known amounts of recombinant MLCK155 were electrophoresed in 7.5% SDS gels, transferred to PVDF membrane, and probed with affinity-purified MLCK155 antibody to generate a standard curve, which was used to compute the amount of immunopurified kinase in each reaction mixture. MLCK activity is expressed as picomoles of 32PO4 incorporated per pmol of RLC/ng of MLCK210. RhoA Phosphorylation and Activity Assay—To determine whether RhoA was phosphorylated in response to elevated cAMP, treated and control monolayers were flooded with 100 μl of 100 °C Laemmli sample buffer, scraped up, sonicated to shear DNA, heated for 10 min at 100 °C, and centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. Equivalent samples were electrophoresed on 12% SDS gels, transferred to PVDF membranes, and probed with a 1:1000 dilution of affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody to RhoA or phospho-Ser188-RhoA. Western blots of phospho-RhoA and total RhoA were detected by ECL methodology. X-ray films were quantitated by laser densitometry, and the phospho-RhoA densitometric units were divided by the RhoA densitometric units for each time point. For each experiment, all phospho-RhoA values were then normalized to the control value and expressed as a ratio of control. BPAE cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish and used 6 days post-confluence. The amount of activated GTP-bound RhoA was determined following the methods described by Ren et al. (46Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar, 47Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed on 12% gels, transferred to PVDF membranes, and probed with a 1:1000 dilution of a rabbit polyclonal antibody to RhoA. Western blots of GTP-bound RhoA and total cell RhoA were visualized with ECL detection reagents. X-ray films were developed at various time intervals to obtain an exposure within the linear range of the film. Films were scanned in a Personal Densitometer (Amersham Biosciences) and data analyzed as outlined by Ren et al. (46Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar, 47Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Phosphatase Activity Assay—BPAE monolayers were either untreated or incubated with 10 μm Fsk, 40 μm IBMX for 1, 2.5, 5, and 15 min, and the media were aspirated and monolayers snap-frozen. Dishes were placed on a 4 °C copper block to thaw, flooded with 400 μl of homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol containing protease inhibitors), scraped up, and homogenized in a glass/glass tissue homogenizer, and spun at 8,000 × g for 10 min. 50-μl aliquots of the cell extracts were snap-frozen in liquid N2 for storage at -70 °C. Cell pellets were dissolved in 25 μl of 0.1% SDS, and protein determinations were performed using a Pierce BCA protein assay after chloroform/methanol extraction as outlined by Wessel and Flugge (48Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3108) Google Scholar).

Based on structural features, aaRSs have been divided into two classes, I and II; there are three subclasses in each class (2Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, from flies to humans, a macromolecular complex has been discovered consisting of 11 polypeptides and containing activities of nine aaRSs: bifunctional glutamylprolyl-, isoleucyl-, leucyl-, methionyl-, glutaminyl-, lysyl-, arginyl-, and aspartyl-tRNA synthetases and three nonsynthetase components, p18, p38, and p43 (3Yang D.C.

The function of the terminal extensions of the aaRSs in the complex assembly has also been tested (15Rho S.B. Kim M.J. Lee J.S. Seol W. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Arginyl-tRNA synthetase is a particular synthetase in that it exists in two forms within mammalian cells.

The N terminus of ArgRS shows interaction with the repeated motif of GluProRS (19Rho S.B. Lee J.S. Jeong E.J. Kim K.S. Kim Y.G. Kim S. J. Biol.

The interaction between ArgRS and p43 has been extensively investigated (20Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.L. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4592-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Human cytosolic leucyl-tRNA synthetase (hcLeuRS; EC 6.1.1.4) has been identified as a component of the human aaRS multienzyme complex (3Yang D.C. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1996; 34: 101-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 4Han J.M. Kim J.Y. Kim S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 303: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but little information about it has been previously obtained. Recently, a cDNA isolated from a human fetal brain has been suggested to be that of hcLeuRS (hcleus) (22Nagase T. Kikuno R. Ishikawa K.I. Hirosawa M. Ohara O. DNA Res. 2000; 7: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). When hcleus was entered into a BLAST search against the human genome data base, 31 exons of the gene were found located on the chromosome 5q32 region (22Nagase T. Kikuno R. Ishikawa K.I. Hirosawa M. Ohara O. DNA Res. 2000; 7: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). According to cDNA analysis, hcLeuRS belongs to the Ia aaRSs, a subclass characterized by the two motifs HIGH and MSKS (2Eriani G. Delarue M. Poch O. Gangloff J. Moras D. Nature. 1990; 347: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). Composed of 1176 amino acid residues, hcLeuRS has a total molecular mass of 134.4 kDa. hcLeuRS is 13.1% identical to Escherichia coli and 10.8% identical to human mitochondrial LeuRS (hmLeuRS). Human and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, and Mus musculus cytosolic LeuRSs share 39.7, 58.3, and 90.0% identical residues, respectively (data not shown). hcLeuRS has been suggested to interact with LysRS, ArgRS, and IleRS (13Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Rho S.B. Kim M.J. Lee J.S. Seol W. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4488-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) by chemical cross-linking and yeast two-hybrid methods. Like many other mammalian and human aaRSs, hcLeuRS has a long C-terminal extension, unlike bacterial and yeast enzymes (Fig. 1). Long extensions in higher eukaryotes have been postulated to be responsible for the assembly of the aaRS complex, since their appearance accompanies the complex formation. Herein, hcleus and ΔChcleus, encoding the full-length and the C-terminal truncated hcLeuRS fused with a DNA sequence encoding a C-terminal His tag, were cloned into a baculovirus vector and used to infect Trichoplusia ni BTI-Tn-5B1-4 insect cells (Tn5). His-tagged hcLeuRS and ΔChcLeuRS from the cytosol were purified with Ni2+-NTA column chromatography, and their catalytic kinetic constants and thermal stability were determined. Additionally, we determined the kinetic constants of hcArgRS and ΔNhcArgRS, the subcellular location of hcLeuRS, ΔChcLeuRS, hcArgRS, and ΔNhcArgRS and proved that the C-terminal extension of hcLeuRS is able to interact with the N terminus of human cytosolic ArgRS (hcArgRS). The role of this specific interaction in the complex assembly is discussed.

Kikuno R. Ishikawa K.I. Hirosawa M. Ohara O. DNA Res. 2000; 7: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Three primers were designed for inserting hcleus (encoding full-length hcLeuRS) and ΔChcleus (encoding C-terminal 89-amino acid truncated hcLeuRS) into the SalI and NotI sites of pFastBac1H. With primers P1-P2 and P1-P3, DNA fragments containing hcleus and ΔChcleus were amplified by PCR from the fj01313 clone, digested by SalI and NotI, and inserted into identical sites in pFastBac1H. The obtained recombinant plasmids pFastBac1H-hcleus and pFastBac1H-ΔChcleus were confirmed with DNA sequencing. For pFastBac1H-hcleus and pFastBac1H-ΔChcleus, recombinant bacmids containing hcleus and ΔChcleus were obtained according to the instruction manual of the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus system. Then recombinant bacmids were used to separately transfect Tn5 insect cells for the expression of the genes encoding hcLeuRS and ΔChcLeuRS with a C-terminal Ala3-His6 tag. After 3 days, Tn5 insect cells were harvested and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Fractionation of subcellular cytosol/mitochondria was carried out as described (23Yao Y.N. Wang L. Wu X.F. Wang E.D. FEBS Lett. 2003; 534: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 24Jørgensen R. Søgaard T.M. Rossing A.B. Martensen P.M. Justesen J. J. Biol.

Cytosol from the two cultures was further centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatant of the cytosol was then loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA column (Qiagen GmbH, Germany) in order to isolate the His-tagged hcLeuRS and ΔChcLeuRS, per the manufacturer's instructions. All steps of fractionation and purification were carried out at 4 °C. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of hcArgRS and ΔNhcArgRS— The plasmid (catalog number 97002RG) containing full-length cDNA of human liver cytoplasmic ArgRS was obtained from Invitrogen. With primers P4-P5 and P6-P5, the genes hcargs (encoding full-length hcArgRS) and ΔNhcargs (encoding N-terminal 72-amino acid truncated hcArgRS) were amplified from the plasmid, respectively. After digestion with NdeI and BamHI, the two generated DNA fragments were inserted into the corresponding sites of pET-15b to obtain pET-hcargs and pET-ΔNhcargs. E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL was transformed with the two plasmids, respectively, to produce hcArgRS and the N-terminal 72-amino acid truncated enzyme ΔNhcArgRS. Colonies were grown at 25 °C to achieve A600 = 0.6 in 1 liter of LB with 100 μg/ml of ampicillin and 60 μg/ml of chloramphenicol and were induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 200 μm, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 0.1 mm and glucose to 0.04% (w/v). After a 4-h induction, the cells were harvested and suspended in buffer A (10 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm, β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.0). After sonication and centrifugation, the supernatant was gently mixed with 1.5 ml of Ni2+-NTA Superflow resin for 30 min. The mixture was loaded on a minicolumn for gravity flow chromatography. The resin was washed with 15 ml of buffer B (except for 20 mm imodazole, other components were as for buffer A) to remove nonspecific binding contaminants. Then the enzyme was eluted with 20 ml of buffer C (again except for 250 mm imidazole, other components were as for buffer A). The eluted His6-hcArgRS or ΔNhcArgRS fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 2 liters of buffer D (20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5), concentrated using a Centricon device (50-200 μl), gently mixed with an equal volume of glycerol, and stored at -20 °C. All steps of the purification were carried out at 4 °C. Human Cytosolic tRNALeu(AAG) and tRNAArg(ACG) Transcription—The genes encoding human cytosolic tRNALeu(AAG) (hctRNALeu) and tRNAArg(ACG) (hctRNAArg) were synthesized according to the procedure of Li et al. (26Li Y. Wang E.D. Wang Y.L. Sci. China (Ser. C). 1998; 41: 225-231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Guigou et al. (21Guigou L Shalak V Mirande M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4592-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), respectively. A plasmid containing the hctRNALeu or hctRNAArg gene was constructed by insertion of the corresponding gene into pUC19. After linearization of plasmids with MvaI and FokI, separately, transcription was performed according to the instruction of RiboMAX large scale RNA production system-T7 (Promega Corp.). Transcripts were purified by 12% (w/v) denaturing PAGE, annealed by incubation for 5 min in 5 mm MgCl2 at 80 °C, and then cooled slowly to 20 °C. Enzymatic Kinetic Assays—The activity and kinetic constants in the ATP-PPi exchange or leucylation of the tRNALeu reaction were determined at 37 °C as described in a previous report (23Yao Y.N. Wang L. Wu X.F. Wang E.D. FEBS Lett. 2003; 534: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Prior to the determination of substrate kinetic constants, the pH value and magnesium ion concentration were optimized for hcLeuRS activity to 7.6 and 2 mm. For determination of the ATP-PPi exchange, the reaction mixture contained 4 mm [32P]pyrophosphate ([32P]PPi, 30 cpm/pmol), 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 8 mm KF, 4 mm ATP, and 4 mm leucine. For leucylation of tRNALeu, the reaction mixture contained 1 mm spermine, 50 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 25 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 μm [14C]leucine (70 cpm/pmol), 4 mm ATP, and 5 μm calf liver tRNALeu or 2 μm transcripts of hctRNALeu. In the determination of kinetic constants, the concentration of leucine, ATP, calf liver tRNALeu, or transcripts of hctRNALeu was varied while the other components were held at the concentration corresponding to the reaction mixture. Reactions were initiated with the addition of 25 nm hcLeuRS and ΔChcLeuRS, respectively. The activity and kinetic constants of hcArgRS and ΔNhcArgRS were determined at 37 °C. For determination of the ATP-PPi exchange, the reaction mixture contained 4 mm [32P]PPi (30 cpm/pmol), 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP, 4 mm arginine, and 5 μm calf liver tRNAArg. For arginylation of tRNAArg, the reaction mixture contained 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 μm [3H]arginine (400 cpm/pmol), 3 mm ATP, and 5 μm calf liver tRNAArg. In the determination of kinetic constants, the concentration of arginine, ATP, or calf liver tRNAArg was varied while the other components were held at the concentration corresponding to the reaction mixture. Reactions were initiated with the addition of 5 nm hcArgRS and ΔNhcArgRS, respectively. Thermal Stability of hcLeuRS and ΔChcLeuRS—40 μg/ml hcLeuRS and ΔChcLeuRS, in 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.6) containing 400 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol, were incubated at various temperatures for 10 min. Aminoacylation activity was then assayed at 37 °C after dilution with 5 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.6. Expression of Enhanced Green Fluorescence Protein (EGFP)-tagged hcLeuRS, ΔChcLeuRS, hcArgRS, and ΔNhcArgRS in Human 293 T Cells and Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—The hcleus, ΔChcleus, hcargs, and ΔNhcargs DNA was amplified by PCR with four pairs of primers, P7-P8, P7-P9, P10-P11, and P11-P12, digested with XhoI and BamHI, and inserted into the gap of the XhoI and BamHI sites in pEGFP-N2 in order to obtain pEGFP-N2-hcleus, pEGFP-N2-ΔChcleus, pEGFP-N2-hcargs, and pEGFP-N2-ΔNhc args. In 293 T cells, pEGFP-N2-hcleus, pEGFP-N2-ΔChcleus, pEGFP-N2-hcargs, and pEGFP-N2-ΔNhcargs produce hcLeuRS, ΔChcLeuRS, hcArgRS, and ΔNhcArgRS fused with EGFP at their C terminus. The 293 T cells were seeded on coverslips in 35-mm dishes. At 50% confluence, 293 T cells were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid using SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen GmbH, Germany) per manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were continuously incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. Nuclei were stained with 5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole per the manufacturer's recommendation. Scanning confocal laser microscopy was performed using the Bio-Rad radiance 2000 confocal microscope system and a ×64 oil immersion objective. Fluorescence images were captured using excitation (488 nm) and emission (515 nm) wavelengths for EGFP and excitation (360 nm) and emission (480 nm) for 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Plasmid Construction and Antibody Preparation for Immunoprecipitation—Two primers were designed for inserting hcleus and ΔChcleus with Flag tag DYKDDDK into pCDNA3. With the two pairs of P1-P15 and P1-P16, DNA fragments containing hcleus and ΔChcleus with FLAG tag sequence were amplified by PCR from pFastBac1H-hcleus, digested with SalI and NotI, and separately inserted into identical sites in pFastBac1H. The fragment between BamHI and NotI was then inserted into corresponding sites in pCDNA3. Primers P13 and P14 were designed to insert Chcleus (encoding the C-terminal 89 amino acids of hcLeuRS) into pEGFP-N2. Recombinant plasmids pCDNA3-hcleus-flag, pCDNA3-ΔChcleus-flag, and pEGFP-N2-Chcleus were confirmed with DNA sequencing. To determine the interaction between hcLeuRS and hcArgRS, the hcArgRS and ΔNhcArgRS were constructed and purified as described above. Anti-ArgRS polyclonal antibody was raised against ΔNhcArgRS in hens by the Shenglongda Group Co. (China). Cell Culture, DNA Transfection, and Immunoprecipitation—Human 293 T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 incubator. Transfection of 293 T cells was performed with 5 μg of pCDNA3-hcleus-flag, pCDNA3-ΔChcleus-flag, pEGFP-N2 and pEGFP-N2-Chcleus using Superfectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4) and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) for 15 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min. Lysates were incubated with monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody and anti-GFP antibody, respectively, and then incubated with recombinant Protein G-agarose overnight. Immunoprecipitated samples were washed five times with lysis buffer (Nonidet P-40 adjusted to 0.1%) and then eluted from recombinant Protein G-agarose by boiling in 1× SDS loading buffer. Electrophoresis and Western Blot (WB)—Proteins were separated using SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon P membrane. The membrane was blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.05% Tween 20 and then immunoblotted with anti-ArgRS antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Results were visualized using the SuperSignal West Pico Trial Kit. Precipitations of hcLeuRS, ΔChcLeuRS, and ChcLeuRS were confirmed by WB with anti-FLAG M2 antibody and anti-GFP antibody. In Vitro Pull-down Assay—The sequence encoding the C-terminal 89 amino acids of hcLeuRS was amplified by PCR from the fj01313 clone with primers P17 and P2 then inserted into the gap between SalI and NotI sites of pET-22b (+). The fragment between NcoI and XhoI was inserted into the pGEX-KG vector to obtain plasmid pGEX-KG-Chcleus. GST and GST-ChcLeuRS were produced from E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3) transformants containing pGEX-KG and pGEX-KG-Chcleus. Cells were sonicated and centrifuged to get the supernatant. GST and GST-ChcLeuRS (1 μg of each) were incubated separately with glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 40 min. After washing the Sepharose four times with phosphate-buffered saline, 1 μg of hcArgRS and ΔNhcArgRS each was diluted in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and complete protease inhibitor mixture), added separately, and then the incubation was continued for 2 h. The Sepharose was washed five times with binding buffer (without bovine serum albumin and glycerol), and bound proteins were eluted from the Sepharose by boiling in 1× SDS loading buffer. The presence of hcArgRS and ΔNhcArgRS was detected using WB with anti-ArgRS antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. Functional Expression and Purification of hcLeuRS and ΔChcLeuRS— Recombinant baculovirus vectors have been widely used to express heterologous genes in cultured insect cells (23Yao Y.N. Wang L.

https://openalex.org/W2041797331,"Myosin VII is an unconventional myosin widely expressed in organisms ranging from amoebae to mammals that has been shown to play vital roles in cell adhesion and phagocytosis. Here we present the first study of the mechanism of action of a myosin VII isoform. We have expressed a truncated single-headed Drosophila myosin VIIB construct in the baculovirus-Sf9 system that bound calmodulin light chains. By using steady-state and transient kinetic methods, we showed that myosin VIIB exhibits a fast release of phosphate and a slower, rate-limiting ADP release from actomyosin. As a result, myosin VIIB will be predominantly strongly bound to actin during steady-state ATP hydrolysis (its duty ratio will be at least 80%). This kinetic pattern is in many respects similar to that of the single-molecule vesicle transporters myosin V and VI. The enzymatic properties of myosin VIIB provide a kinetic basis for processivity upon possible dimerization via the C-terminal domains of the heavy chain. Our experiments also revealed conformational heterogeneity of the actomyosin VIIB complex in the absence of nucleotide.

In mice, myosin VIIA mutants (shaker-1) exhibit severe sensory dysfunction because of disorganization of the stereocilial bundle of auditory hair cells (3Gibson F. Walsh J. Mburu P. Varela A.

Lack of myosin VIIA activity in Drosophila crinkled (ck) mutants results in deafness or embryonic/larval lethality (5Kiehart D.P. Franke J.D. Chee M.K. Montague R.A. Chen T.L. Roote J. Ashburner M.

Based on motor domain sequence analysis, the fly myosin VIIs form a distinct phylogenetic cluster from the group of mammalian myosin VIIs, and thus Drosophila myosins VIIA and VIIB are not orthologous to their mammalian counterparts (12Yamashita R.A. Sellers J.R. Anderson J.B. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 491-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On the other hand, loss of myosin VIIA function causes deafness in both Drosophila and mammals (3Gibson F. Walsh J. Mburu P. Varela A. Brown K.A. Antonio M. Beisel K.W. Steel K.P. Brown S.D.

As in most other myosins, the myosin VII heavy chain consists of an N-terminal motor domain containing the actin and ATP-binding sites, a neck (light chain-binding) domain, and a C-terminal tail consisting of several effector domains. The tail of myosin VII comprises a putative coiled-coil region, two MyTH4 and FERM domains, and a Src homology 3 domain. These domains interact with various binding partners of effector function. One of the identified binding partners is MyRIP (myosin VIIA- and Rab-interacting protein) that associates with the myosin VIIA tail domain and Rab27A to connect retinal melanosomes to the actin cytoskeleton and regulate their trafficking (13El-Amraoui A. Schonn J.S. Kussel-Andermann P. Blanchard S. Desnos C. Henry J.P. Wolfrum U. Darchen F. Petit C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 463-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Another binding partner is vezatin, which can interact with both the myosin VIIA C-terminal FERM domain and the cadherin-catenin complex and thus create a link between adherens junctions and the actin cytoskeleton and strengthen cell-cell adhesion (14Kussel-Andermann P. El-Amraoui A. Safieddine S. Nouaille S. Perfettini I. Lecuit M. Cossart P. Wolfrum U. Petit C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6020-6029Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Talin has recently been shown to associate directly with myosin VII in Dictyostelium, thus mediating cell-substrate adhesion and filopodial extension (6Tuxworth R.I. Weber I. Wessels D. Addicks G.C.

These data indicate a role for myosin VII in organelle transport and the maintenance of contact and/or tension between the actin cytoskeleton and the cell membrane. Although two mammalian myosin VIIA orthologs have been shown to exhibit actin-activated ATPase activity and in vitro motility (15Inoue A. Ikebe M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5478-5487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 16Udovichenko I.P. Gibbs D. Williams D.S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 445-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), no detailed mechanistic study has been performed on any myosin VII isoform. In the present paper, we report an in-depth biochemical kinetic characterization of a recombinant single-headed Drosophila myosin VIIB construct (mVIIB-S1). We demonstrate that this myosin uses a kinetic mechanism characterized by a high actin attachment ratio during rapid ATPase cycling. These properties are mainly defined by the kinetics of sequential product release steps (fast phosphate release and rate-limiting ADP dissociation). These features, which are similar to those of myosin V and VI, will be of central importance in the tension-bearing and/or possible processive transport role of myosin VII in cells. Expression and Purification of the Myosin VIIB-S1 (mVIIB-S1) Protein—A cDNA fragment encoding the first 842 amino acids (motor domain plus all five predicted light chain-binding IQ motifs) of the Drosophila myosin VIIB heavy chain (Myo28B1) was amplified from an earlier Drosophila myosin VIIB clone (12Yamashita R.A. Sellers J.R. Anderson J.B. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 491-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and subcloned into baculovirus transfer vector pFastBac1 (Invitrogen). The complete nucleotide sequence of the recombinant plasmid was confirmed by double-stranded DNA sequencing. A FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) was fused to the C terminus of mVIIB-S1 to aid purification. mVIIB-S1 was co-expressed with Drosophila calmodulin in Sf9 cells. The expressed mVIIB-S1 protein was purified as described previously for non-muscle myosin IIA heavy meromyosin (17Wang F. Harvey E.V. Conti M.A. Wei D. Sellers J.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5555-5560Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Kinetic Measurements—Steady-state ATPase activities were measured by an NADH-coupled assay at 25 °C as described previously (18Wang F. Kovacs M. Hu A. Limouze J. Harvey E.V. Sellers J.R. J. Biol.

(pH 7.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm EGTA, 1 mm ATP, and 10 mm KCl. Stopped-flow measurements were performed using a KinTek SF-2001 stopped-flow instrument (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX) at 25 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm EGTA, and 50 mm KCl (10 mm KCl was used in stopped-flow experiments measuring Pi release).

Quenched-flow experiments were carried out using a KinTek RQF-3 quenched-flow instrument as described earlier (18Wang F. Kovacs M. Hu A. Limouze J. Harvey E.V. Sellers J.R. J. Biol.

Reagent concentrations stated in rapid mixing experiments refer to post-mix concentrations unless stated otherwise. Actin from rabbit skeletal muscle was prepared (20Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol.

Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) as described. Actin filaments were stabilized by a 1.5-fold molar excess of phalloidin (Calbiochem) in all experiments. mVIIB-S1 and acto-mVIIB-S1 were made nucleotide-free by preincubation with 0.02 units/ml apyrase for 30 min at 25 °C when required. 2′-Deoxymethylanthranyloyl-ATP and -ADP (dmATP and dmADP, respectively) and fluorescently labeled bacterial phosphate-binding protein (MDCC-PBP) (22Brune M.

Other reagents were from Sigma. Means ± S.D. are reported for 2–3 rounds of experiments. Data fitting and analysis was done using the KinTek SF-2001 software and OriginLab 7.0 (Microcal Corp.). Construct Design and Expression—The mVIIB-S1 heavy chain construct we used contains the motor domain and the entire neck region of Drosophila myosin VIIB, up to the beginning of the predicted coiled-coil segment. We co-expressed the mVIIB-S1 heavy chain with Drosophila calmodulin, because bovine myosin VIIA has been shown previously to bind calmodulin in immunoprecipitation experiments (16Udovichenko I.P. Gibbs D. Williams D.S. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 445-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mVIIB-S1 construct showed reasonably good levels of expression in the baculovirus-Sf9 system, and generally 1 mg of protein could be purified from 109 cells. Previously, we identified the presence of five putative light chain-binding IQ motifs in the neck region of Drosophila myosin VIIB (12Yamashita R.A. Sellers J.R. Anderson J.B. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 491-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, the relative intensities of the heavy chain and calmodulin bands in the electrophoretic profile of purified mVIIB-S1 indicated that calmodulins bind in a smaller number to the heavy chain (Fig. 1). ATPase Mechanism in the Absence of Actin—We used 2′-deoxymant-ATP (dmATP), a fluorescent ATP analog, to monitor the kinetics of ATP binding to mVIIB-S1. When mixed with mVIIB-S1 in the stopped-flow apparatus under pseudo-first-order conditions, dmATP showed a single exponential fluorescence increase on binding to the protein (Fig. 2A, inset). The second-order binding rate constant calculated from the linear slope of the plot of the observed rate constant (kobs) versus [dmATP] was 3.4 ± 0.1 μm–1 s–1 (Fig. 2A).

Chem. 2000; 275: 25481-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), mVIIB-S1 showed an increase in tryptophan fluorescence on interacting with ATP. The tryptophan fluorescence increase occurs upon a protein isomerization occurring on nucleotide binding (k2 in Scheme 1) and/or on the ATP hydrolysis step (k3 + k–3). The maximal kobs likely reflects the kinetics of the ATP hydrolysis step (k3 + k–3), with possible contributions from k2. The tryptophan fluorescence increase transients were single exponential, and their kobs showed saturation around 160 s–1 (Fig. 2B). The second-order ATP-binding rate constant (K1k2 in Scheme 1) deduced from the parameters of the hyperbolic fit of Fig. 2B (K1k2 = kobs, max/K½ where K½ is the ATP concentration at half-maximal kobs value) was 4.7 μm–1 s–1. To monitor directly ATP hydrolysis in the transient state, we performed quenched-flow experiments with mVIIB-S1. When mVIIB-S1 was rapidly mixed with a substoichiometric amount of [γ-32P]ATP (single turnover conditions), the time course of ATP hydrolysis consisted of two phases (Fig. 2C). ATP hydrolysis in the fast phase was rate-limited by ATP binding. The fractional amplitude of this phase (Afast = 0.74) reflects the equilibrium constant of the ATP hydrolysis step (K3 = Afast/(1 – Afast) = 2.8), which rapidly equilibrates after ATP binding. The subsequent slow and irreversible release of phosphate in the second phase (k4) completes the reaction (Fig. 2C). The value thus obtained for K3 is likely to represent a lower limit for the equilibrium constant, because the second phase was difficult to resolve accurately. In a multiple turnover experiment in which mVIIB-S1 was mixed with excess ATP, an exponential Pi burst of 0.48 mol of Pi/mol of S1 was observed, which was followed by a linear phase of steady-state ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 2C, inset). The lower burst than that in the single turnover measurement may result from the fact that the multiple turnover experiment is influenced by uncertainties in protein concentration determination and/or the presence of a minor inactive subpopulation in the mVIIB-S1 preparation. We monitored the interaction of mVIIB-S1 with ADP using dmADP, a fluorescent nucleotide analog. Upon mixing mVIIB-S1 with excess dmADP in the stopped-flow, single exponential traces were observed as dmADP fluorescence increased on binding to mVIIB-S1. The dependence of kobs on dmADP concentration was linear in the observed range (Fig. 2D). The slope of the plot yielded a second-order binding rate constant (k–5) of 2.3 ± 0.1 μm–1 s–1, and the intercept delineated an off-rate constant (k5) of 9.0 ± 0.2 s–1. The off-rate constant was confirmed in chasing experiments in which the complex of mVIIB-S1 with dmADP was mixed with a large excess of ATP in the stopped-flow (Fig. 2D, inset). These experiments yielded a k5 of 10.1 ± 0.7 s–1. Because all measured steps of the basal mVIIB-S1 ATPase cycle (ATP binding, hydrolysis, and ADP release) appear to be much faster than the measured basal steady-state ATPase rate (0.020 s–1 measured in a NADH-coupled steady-state assay), it is likely that the latter is limited largely by the phosphate release step (k4), as is the case in all myosins examined. Actin Activation of the Steady-state ATPase Activity—The steady-state ATPase activity of mVIIB-S1 was activated by actin to a maximum (Vmax) of 8.4 ± 0.6 s–1 (Fig. 3 and TABLE ONE). The actin concentration required for half-maximal activation (KATPase) was 39 ± 5 μm. Note that these steady-state measurements were done in 10 mm KCl instead of 50 mm KCl applied in most transient kinetic experiments of the present study. Actin Binding in the Absence of Nucleotide and in ADP—Actin site-specifically labeled with pyrene has been used extensively to monitor the strong binding interaction of myosin with actin in the case of many myosins (26Criddle A.H. Geeves M.A. Jeffries T. Biochem. J. 1985; 232: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 27Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Pyrene-actin showed a large (>50%) fluorescence quench on binding to mVIIB-S1, which we could exploit in measuring the actin binding kinetics of mVIIB-S1 by mixing mVIIB-S1 or mVIIB-S1·ADP with pyrene-actin under pseudo-first-order conditions in the stopped-flow (Fig. 4A, inset). Fig. 4A shows the dependence of the kobs of the observed fluorescence quench on pyrene-actin concentration. The slopes of the plots delineate second-order actin binding rate constants of 1.2 ± 0.1 and 1.0 ± 0.1 μm–1 s–1 in the absence of nucleotide (k–6) and in ADP (k–10), respectively. The rate constant of mVIIB-S1 dissociation from actin is expected to be low and therefore cannot be accurately determined from the intercepts of the plots of Fig. 4A. Thus, we performed chasing experiments in which the pyrene-acto-S1 rigor complex or the pyrene-acto-S1·ADP ternary complex was rapidly mixed with excess unlabeled actin in the stopped-flow. Fig. 4B shows the obtained pyrene fluorescence transients. Single exponential fits to the transients revealed dissociation rate constants from actin of 0.042 and 0.034 s–1, respectively, for S1 (k6) and S1·ADP (k10). Single exponential fits showed some systematic deviation from the traces (Fig. 4B). Although the introduction of an additional phase slightly improved the fits (data not shown), the kobs values of the two phases were only separated by factors of 3–4 and thus may not bear practical significance. Therefore, we believe that the reported single exponential rate constants represent reasonably good estimates for the dissociation rate constants. These results demonstrate that the presence of ADP does not notably affect the kinetics of actin binding and release. Interaction of Acto-mVIIB-S1 with Nucleotides—We followed the kinetics of ATP-induced dissociation of the pyrene-acto-mVIIB-S1 complex in stopped-flow experiments in which pyrene-acto-mVIIB-S1 was mixed with increasing concentrations of ATP under pseudo-first-order conditions. Most interestingly, the traces were clearly triphasic throughout the ATP concentration range examined, which is a more complicated behavior than that observed with other myosins (Fig. 5A, see also “Discussion”). The kobs of the first phase increased steeply with ATP concentration (initial slope delineating K1′k2′ = 1.3 ± 0.1 μm–1 s–1, Fig. 5B; TABLE TWO) and showed signs of saturation above 400 s (k2′, Fig. 5B). The second phase kobs also increased with increasing actin concentration and showed an initial slope about four times lower than that of the first phase (0.31 ± 0.08 μm–1 s–1, Fig. 5B; TABLE TWO). The records contained an additional minor third phase with a kobs of 1.0 ± 0.5 s–1, which did not change with ATP concentration (data not shown). The fractional amplitudes of the three phases (phase 1, 46 ± 12%; phase 2, 36 ± 8%; and phase 3, 18 ± 4%) did not show a systematic dependence on ATP concentration. The experiments above assessed ATP binding to a nucleotide-free pyrene-acto-mVIIB-S1 complex. We investigated the effect of ADP on this process by preincubating pyrene-acto-mVIIB-S1 with different concentrations of ADP, and by mixing these pre-mixtures with a large excess of ATP (250 μm post-mix) in the stopped-flow. These experiments also produced triphasic pyrene fluorescence transients. However, the kobs values of the three phases remained constant with increasing ADP concentration (phase 1, 150± 40 s–1; phase 2, 9.8 ± 3.5 s–1 and phase 3, 1.2 ± 0.2 s–1) (Fig. 5C). The fractional amplitudes of phases 1 and 2 flipped over in a hyperbolic manner (with phase 1 amplitude decreasing and phase 2 amplitude increasing) with increasing ADP concentration, indicating an ADP dissociation constant (K5′) of 1.7 ± 0.9 μm (Fig. 5D; TABLE ONE). The fractional amplitude of phase 3 (0.21 ± 0.03) remained constant over the ADP concentration range examined. The binding of dmATP to nucleotide-free acto-mVIIB-S1 under pseudo-first-order conditions was also multiphasic. This finding is again unusual in myosins and is in line with the pyrene-actin results discussed above. Upon mixing acto-mVIIB-S1 with dmATP under pseudo-first-order conditions in the stopped-flow, two exponential phases of dmATP fluorescence increase were observed throughout the examined dmATP concentration range (Fig. 6A). The two phases had roughly equal fractional amplitudes (phase 1, 0.46 ± 0.06; phase 2, 0.54 ± 0.06, TABLE TWO), which did not change with dmATP concentration. The kobs values of both phases showed linear dependences on dmATP concentration with slopes of 2.2 ± 0.1 μm–1 s–1 (phase 1) and 0.46 ± 0.02 μm–1 s–1 (phase 2) (Fig. 6A, inset; TABLE TWO). The binding of dmADP to acto-mVIIB-S1 was monophasic. The dependence of the kobs values of the binding transients on dmADP concentration delineated a linear slope (k–5′) of 2.7 ± 0.4 μm–1 s–1 and an intercept (k5′) of 16 ± 1 s–1 and (Fig. 6B; TABLE ONE). The absolute amplitude of the transients depended hyperbolically on dmADP concentration and indicated a dissociation constant (K5′) of 2.7 ± 0.4 μm (Fig. 6B, inset). The dmADP release rate constant (k5′) was also measured in a chasing experiment in which the acto-mVIIB-S1·dmADP ternary complex was mixed with a large excess of ATP (Fig. 6C). The single exponential dmADP dissociation transients delineated a k5′ of 9.6 ± 1.3 s–1 in these experiments (TABLE ONE). Phosphate Release—We measured Pi release using MDCC-PBP, a fluorescently labeled phosphate-binding protein (22Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 28White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In double-mixing stopped-flow experiments, mVIIB-S1 was first rapidly mixed with sub-stoichiometric amounts of ATP (single turnover conditions), incubated for 1 s for ATP binding and hydrolysis to occur (cf. K1k2, and k3 + k–3 in TABLE ONE), and then rapidly mixed in the second mix with a range of actin concentrations to facilitate Pi release from the mVIIB-S1-products complex (28White H.D. Belknap B. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11828-11836Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). After the first mix, an equilibrium mixture of the pre- and post-hydrolysis species will form (M·ATP and M·ADP·Pi in Scheme 1). The Pi release transients obtained under these conditions reflect two processes. First, the binding of M·ADP·Pi to actin (K9) and subsequent Pi release (k4′) will result in a phase whose kobs is expected to depend hyperbolically on actin concentration (Fig. 7, A and B). Second, if M·ATP is present at a significant concentration in the pre-mixture before the actin mix (i.e. K3 is fairly reversible), then an additional slow phase will appear that results from the flux of the reaction through the pathway involving a possible slow actin-associated ATP hydrolysis (K8 and k3′) (28White H.D.

This phase was not significant in our experiments, in line with the quenched-flow and tryptophan fluorescence results showing that K3 is fairly high and the cleavage step is rapid (k3 + k–3 = 160 ± 30 s–1) (Fig. 2, B–C; TABLE ONE). (A slow phase with a kobs around 0.03 s–1 was present in all traces, but with control measurements we established that this phase was present also in the absence of mVIIB-S1 (data not shown).) The fast phase kobs increased roughly linearly with actin concentration in the examined range (up to 38 μm actin after the second mix) (Fig. 7, A and B). This indicates that the actin affinity of M·ADP·Pi is low (K9 > 40 μm), and only a lower limit of k4 ′ (> 40 s–1) can be determined. The linear slope of the plot of kobs versus actin concentration gave an apparent second-order binding constant of M·ADP·Pi binding to actin (k4′/K9, cf. Scheme 1) of 0.79 μm–1 s–1 (TABLE ONE). mVIIB-S1 Exhibits a H"
https://openalex.org/W1982930898,"The function of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), a key molecule of insulin signaling, is modulated by phosphorylation at multiple serine/threonine residues. Phorbolester stimulation of cells induces phosphorylation of two inhibitory serine residues in IRS-1, i.e. Ser-307 and Ser-318, suggesting that both sites may be targets of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms. However, in an in vitro system using a broad spectrum of PKC isoforms (α, β1, β2, δ, ϵ, η, μ), we detected only Ser-318, but not Ser-307 phosphorylation, suggesting that phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of this site in intact cells requires additional signaling elements and serine kinases that link PKC activation to Ser-307 phosphorylation. As we have observed recently that the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2, a negative regulator of insulin signaling, is a substrate of PKC, we studied the role of Shp2 in this context. We found that phorbol ester-induced Ser-307 phosphorylationis reduced markedly in Shp2-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Shp2–/–) whereas Ser-318 phosphorylation is unaltered. The Ser-307 phosphorylation was rescued by transfection of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with wild-type Shp2 or with a phosphatase-inactive Shp2 mutant, respectively. In this cell model, tumor necrosis factor-α-induced Ser-307 phosphorylation as well depended on the presence of Shp2. Furthermore, Shp2-dependent phorbol ester effects on Ser-307 were blocked by wortmannin, rapamycin, and the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor SP600125. This suggests an involvement of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin cascade and of JNK in this signaling pathway resulting in IRS-1 Ser-307 phosphorylation. Because the activation of these kinases does not depend on Shp2, it is concluded that the function of Shp2 is to direct these activated kinases to IRS-1.

Upon activation of PKC, IRS-1 is phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues that have been shown to contribute to the development of insulin resistance (10De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

Among several potential serine phosphorylation sites of IRS-1, serine 307 (rat IRS-1 Ser-307 corresponds to Ser-312 of human IRS-1) is a key regulatory site because phosphorylation of Ser-307 inhibits insulin-mediated activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3 (PI 3)-kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways by disturbing the interaction of IRS-1 with the insulin receptor (12Aguirre V.

Recently, it was reported that phorbol ester-stimulated PKC activation promotes phosphorylation of IRS-1 at Ser-307 (15Jiang G. Dallas-Yang Q. Liu F. Moller D.E. Zhang B.B. J. Biol.

However, we and others have recently shown using in vitro phosphorylation assays that rat IRS-1 Ser-318 (corresponding to Ser-323 of human IRS-1), but not Ser-307, serves as a major PKC phosphorylation site (17Greene M.W.

Thus, PKC-dependent Ser-307 phosphorylation in intact cells is probably not direct and requires further downstream effectors. One candidate mediator is the cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase Shp2, which was shown previously (19Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

Furthermore, Shp2 mRNA, protein, and activity were shown to be increased in liver and skeletal muscle of animal models of insulin resistance and diabetes (23Ahmad F. Goldstein B.J.

In 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, overexpression of wild-type Shp2 impairs insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 as well as PI 3-kinase activation, resulting in decreased glycogen synthesis (25Ouwens D.M. van der Zon G.C. Maassen J.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 175: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Structurally, Shp2 is characterized by a catalytic subunit at the carboxyl terminus and two Src homology 2 (SH2) domains at the amino terminus (26Adachi M. Fischer E.H. Ihle J. Imai K. Jirik F. Neel B. Pawson T. Shen S. Thomas M. Ullrich A. Zhao Z. Cell. 1996; 85: 15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). With its SH2 domains, Shp2 binds tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins including components of the insulin signaling pathway, such as the insulin receptor (27Staubs P.A. Reichart D.R. Saltiel A.R.

Tartare-Deckert S. Sawka-Verhelle D. Gamha A. van Obberghen E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4944-4952Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and the insulin receptor substrates (31Ross S.A.

Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Treatment with vanadate reverses the effects of hyperglycemia on insulin receptor and IRS-1 phosphorylation status by blocking Shp2 association with IRS-1 (34Bifulco G. Caruso M. Di Carlo C.

Based on the ability of Shp2 to regulate insulin signaling negatively and our recent finding that Shp2 is a substrate of classical and novel PKC isoforms (35Strack V. Krützfeldt J. Kellerer M. Ullrich A. Lammers R. Häring H.U. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we investigated in this study whether Shp2 is a mediator of PKC-induced phosphorylation of Ser-307 in IRS-1.

Protein G-Sepharose CL-4B and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. All HPLC-grade solvents were obtained from Merck. Purification and in Vitro Phosphorylation of GST-IRS-1N2 with PKC Isoforms—The glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein with the amino-terminal fragment of rat IRS-1 (IRS-1N2; amino acids 265–522; size 53.8 kDa), was generated as described previously (18Moeschel K. Beck A. Weigert C. Lammers R. Kalbacher H. Voelter W. Schleicher E.D. Häring H.U. Lehmann R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25157-25163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In brief, the fragment was ligated to GST and cloned into the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences). The DNA encoding this region of IRS-1 was synthesized by PCR using rat IRS-1 cDNA as template and pairs of oligonucleotide primers that contain appropriate restriction sites bordering these fragments (36Sun X.J. Crimmins D.L. Myers Jr., M.G. Miralpeix M. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7418-7428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For mutation of the codon for amino acid position 318 serine to alanine, base substitutions were made by oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis. The mutagenesis upstream primer used was 5′-GGTGGGAAACCAGGTGCCTTCAGGGTGCGTGCC-3′ with the wild-type IRS-1 expression vector as template. Positive clones were verified by sequencing. The PCR products were isolated, digested with appropriate restriction enzymes, and subcloned into pGEX-2T vectors, which were used to transform Escherichia coli BL21. The fusion protein was expressed and purified by affinity chromatography. The in vitro phosphorylation assays were performed at 30 °C for 90 min with 1 nmol of the isolated GST-IRS-1N2 protein fragments (wild-type and S318A mutant), which were phosphorylated in vitro by recombinant PKCisoformsα,β1,β2,ϵ,θ, and μ (Calbiochem) in 55 mm HEPES, pH7.5, 1.25 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml l-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine, 1μg/ml 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, 100μm ATP, and 6 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The samples were analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. In-gel Protein Digestion and Reversed Phase HPLC Peptide Separation—The GST-IRS-1N2 protein was excised and in-gel digested as described previously (37Beck A. Moeschel K. Deeg M. Häring H.U. Voelter W. Schleicher E.D. Lehmann R. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 2003; 14: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Peptides eluted from the polyacrylamide matrix were separated on a 100 × 2.0 (inner diameter) mm C4/C18 reversed phase column (Grom, Herrenberg, Germany) using a 10A HPLC system (Shimadzu, Duisburg, Germany) equipped with a Uvichord 2215 UV-Detector (Amersham Biosciences). The gradient program used was: 0–5 min 3% B, 5–10 min 15% B, and 10–80 min 60% B, where A was 0.025% trifluoroacetic acid in water and B was 0.023% trifluoroacetic acid, 80% acetonitrile in water at a flow rate of 250 μl/min. Elution was monitored at 214 nm. Collected fractions (1 min cut) were analyzed in a Trilux 1450 MicroBeta Plus β-counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cell Culture—Shp2 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF Shp2–/–), kindly provided by Dr. Tony Pawson, Toronto, Canada, and the human cell line BOSC 23 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (1 g/liter glucose), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Packaging cells GP+E86 were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g/liter glucose) containing 10% fetal calf serum. Generation of Recombinant Retroviruses—The cDNAs for Shp2, the serine-to-alanine mutant Shp2 S576A/S591A, and the phosphatase-negative Shp2 (C459A), described previously (35Strack V. Krützfeldt J. Kellerer M. Ullrich A. Lammers R. Häring H.U. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), were excised from the cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter-based expression plasmid pRK5 as EcoRI/XhoI fragments and ligated into EcoRI/XhoI-digested retroviral expression vector pLXSN (38Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar). After analyzing the sequences of the plasmid constructs by sequencing, plasmid DNA was prepared using a Qiagen Plasmid Kit. To receive retroviral stocks by transient transfection (39Landau N.R. Littman D.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5110-5113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), BOSC 23 cells were transfected with each of these constructs. To increase the titer of the recombinant retroviruses, 105 exponentially growing packaging cells GP+E86/6-well plate were incubated with supernatants of BOSC 23 cells containing the recombinant retroviruses for 12 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene. Virus-containing medium was then removed, and cells were grown for selection in medium containing 750 μg/ml Geneticin for 2–3 weeks. Retrovirus-mediated Gene Transfer—105 MEF Shp2–/– cells/6-well plate were incubated with the supernatants of retrovirus-expressing GP+E86 cells in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene for 24 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Virus-containing medium was then removed, and cells were selected in medium containing 750 μg/ml Geneticin for 2 weeks. Geneticin-resistant clones were transferred to 10-cm dishes and analyzed for the expression of the transduced gene. Stimulation and Cell Lysis—MEF cells were stimulated with 100 nm TPA for 10 to 120 min, or 100 nm insulin, 5 nm TNF-α, 25 mm glucose, 25 μg/ml anisomycin, or 10 μm PtdIns(3,4)P2 for 30 min at 37 °C. In some experiments, cells were preincubated with 20 μm JNK inhibitor SP600125, 1 μm p38 kinase inhibitor SB203580, 20 μm MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) 1 inhibitor PD98059, 500 nm PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I, 15 μm IKK-β inhibitor 15dPGJ2, 10 and 100 nm PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, or 25 nm mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor rapamycin each for 10 min at 37 °C, with 25 μm Ras inhibitor farnesylthiosalicylic acid or 1 μm Ras inhibitor FTI-277 each for 24 h at 37 °C. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were lysed (500 μl/10-cm diameter dish) with ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) containing a protease/phosphatase inhibitor mix(1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Western Blotting—After separation by SDS-PAGE (100 μg of total protein/lane), proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by semi-dry electroblotting. Membranes were incubated in gelatin buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.25% gelatin, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature, probed with the appropriate primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, washed three times with gelatin buffer followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1.5 h at room temperature. Signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. PI 3-Kinase Assay—PI 3-kinase assays were performed as described by Morgan et al. (40Morgan S.J. Smith A.D. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, PI 3-kinase was immunoprecipitated from MEF cell lysates. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 100 μmol/liter Na3VO4; twice in 500 mmol/liter LiCl, 100 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mmol/liter Na3VO4; and twice in 10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, and 100 μmol/liter Na3VO4. The beads were resuspended in 25 μl of 60 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mmol/liter NaCl, 12 mmol/liter MgCl2, and 12.5 μl of phosphatidylinositol (1 mg/ml). The kinase reaction was started by adding 12.5 μl of 40 μmol/liter ATP containing 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP, and samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 150 μl of 1 n HCl. Lipids were extracted once with 450 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v), and the phospholipid-containing organic phase was resolved on thin layer chromatography plates and developed in chloroform:methanol:acetone:glacial acetic acid:water (40:13:15:12:7, v/v). Thin layer chromatography plates were dried and exposed on film. JNK Activity Immunoassay—JNK activity immunoassay was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief, JNK was immunoprecipitated from MEF cell lysates, immunoprecipitates were washed three times, the kinase reaction was started by adding c-Jun protein and an ATP mixture, and samples were incubated for 25 min at 30 °C. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting was performed as described above using a c-Jun phospho-specific antibody. Densitometry and Statistical Analysis—For quantification of signal intensity of phospho-specific immunoblots, the EasyWin32 Herolab Software was used. Densitometric data obtained from phospho-specific signals were normalized to the densitometric values obtained from the corresponding immunoblots detecting protein expression. At least five independent experiments were performed to obtain mean values ± S.E. A one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni's post hoc multiple comparison test was used to detect differences between the groups. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. In Vitro Phosphorylation of IRS-1N2 by Phorbol Ester-inducible PKC Isoforms—Based on mass spectrometry, we and others have recently identified Ser-318 as a major in vitro phosphorylation site of PKC isoforms ζ and δ in the IRS-1N2 fragment (rat IRS-1 sequence comprising amino acids 265–522) (17Greene M.W. Morrice N. Garofalo R.S. Roth R.A. Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 37Beck A. Moeschel K. Deeg M. Häring H.U. Voelter W. Schleicher E.D. Lehmann R. J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 2003; 14: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, we did not detect Ser-307 phosphorylation. Therefore, we tested whether other phorbol ester-inducible PKC isoforms, such as PKC-α,-β1, -β2, -ϵ,-θ, and μ, are able to phosphorylate Ser-307 directly in the same experimental setting. Using these isoforms in recombinant form, the fragment IRS-1N2 was again phosphorylated at Ser-318, but not at Ser-307 (data not shown). From these results, we conclude that IRS-1 Ser-307 is not a direct substrate for PKC and that phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of this site in intact cells requires additional signaling elements. Involvement of Shp2 in TPA-induced Phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser-307—Because we have recently observed that the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 is a substrate of PKC, we studied the role of Shp2 in this context. In mock-transfected MEF Shp2–/– cells, TPA only weakly stimulated Ser-307 phosphorylation of IRS-1. However, after reexpression of wild-type Shp2, phosphorylation of Ser-307 was enhanced markedly (Fig. 1A). By contrast, there was no difference in TPA-induced Ser-318 phosphorylation between mock-transfected MEF Shp2–/– cells and Shp2-reexpressing cells (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that Shp2 is specifically involved in TPA-induced phosphorylation of Ser-307. To confirm the involvement of PKC, TPA-treated MEF cells reexpressing wild-type Shp2 were preincubated with the PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I. This treatment caused markedly diminished TPA-induced Ser-307 phosphorylation (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Phorbol ester-dependent IRS-1 Ser-307 phosphorylation requires PKC. MEF cells reexpressing human wild-type (wt) Shp2 were treated with 100 nm TPA (30 min) with or without preincubation (30 min) with 500 nm PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I (BIS). A representative immunoblot is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In MEF cells transfected with human wild-type Shp2, not only stimulation with the PKC activator TPA (100 nm), but also treatment with insulin (100 nm), TNF-α (5 nm), and high glucose (25 mm), resulted in increased IRS-1 Ser-307 phosphorylation. These phosphorylation events were diminished in MEF Shp2–/– cells (Fig. 3, A and B). However, only the TPA- and TNF-α-induced Ser-307 phosphorylation signals significantly depended on the presence of Shp2 (p < 0.05, Bonferroni's post hoc test, n = 5, Fig. 3B). In conclusion, TPA- and TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser-307 requires Shp2, whereas this protein-tyrosine phosphatase is not involved in PKC-stimulated Ser-318 phosphorylation. Role of Serine Residues 576 and 591 and the Phosphatase Activity of Shp2 in TPA-stimulated IRS-1 Ser-307 Phosphorylation—Because Shp2 is phosphorylated at serine residues 576 and 591 by PKC (35Strack V. Krützfeldt J. Kellerer M. Ullrich A. Lammers R. Häring H.U. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we tested the involvement of these phosphorylation sites in TPA-stimulated phosphorylation of IRS-1 Ser-307. Furthermore, we tested the requirement of phosphatase activity in TPA-induced IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser-307. To this end, we introduced mutant forms of Shp2, i.e. the double mutant S576A/S591A and the mutant phosphatase-negative C459A, into Shp2–/– cells. In contrast to the mock-transfected MEF MEF Shp2–/–cells, all Shp2 constructs (wild-type, double mutant S576A/S591A, and phosphatase-negative form) promoted significant TPA-induced Ser-307 phosphorylation. However, there was no significant difference in the degree of TPA-dependent Ser-307 phosphorylation between wild-type and mutant Shp2 forms (Fig. 4, A and B). This suggests that neither the PKC phosphorylation sites nor the phosphatase activity is necessary for Shp2 mediation of PKC-induced IRS-1 Ser-307 phosphorylation. Role of JNK in Shp2-dependent IRS-1 Ser-307 Phosphorylation—JNK and IKK-β have been described as phosphorylating IRS-1 at Ser-307 (13Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R."
https://openalex.org/W1990463731,"Differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells is associated with up-and-down regulation of expression of a variety of genes including those involved in nutrient uptake. Nothing is known about possible differentiation-dependent regulation of the intestinal thiamin uptake process and the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in such regulation. Using as models human-derived intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells and crypt/villus epithelial cells isolated from wild-type and transgenic mice carrying promoters for human thiamin transporter-1 and -2 (hTHTR-1 and hTHTR-2), we addressed this issue. Our results showed that differentiation of Caco-2 cells is associated with a significant up-regulation in carrier-mediated thiamin uptake. Up-regulation was associated with a significant increase in the level of expression of hTHTR-1 and hTHTR-2 protein and mRNA as well as in activity of the corresponding transfected human thiamin transporter-1 (<i>SLC19A2</i>) and -2 (<i>SLC19A3</i>) promoters. Deletion analysis identified the differentiation-responsive region to be at position –356 to –275 bp for the <i>SLC19A2</i> promoter and at position –77 to –13 bp for the <i>SLC19A3</i> promoter. In addition, a critical and specific role in the differentiation-mediated effects for an NF1 binding site (–348 to –345 bp) in the <i>SLC19A2</i> promoter and a SP1/GC-box binding site (–48 to –45 bp) in the <i>SLC19A3</i> promoter were established using mutational analysis. The physiological relevance of <i>in vitro</i> findings with Caco-2 cells was confirmed in wild-type and transgenic mice by demonstrating that thiamin uptake and mRNA levels of the mouse THTR-1 and THTR-2, as well as activity of human <i>SLC19A2</i> and <i>SLC19A3</i> promoters expressed in transgenic mice, were all significantly higher in intestinal villus compared with crypt epithelial cells. These studies demonstrate for the first time that differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells is associated with an up-regulation in thiamin uptake process and that this up-regulation appears to be mediated via transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that involve the <i>SLC19A2</i> and <i>SLC19A3</i> genes."
https://openalex.org/W2140018242,"Insulin gene expression is regulated by pancreatic β cell-specific factors, PDX-1 and BETA2/E47. Here we have demonstrated that the insulin promoter is a novel target for SREBPs established as lipid-synthetic transcription factors. Promoter analyses of rat insulin I gene in non-β cells revealed that nuclear SREBP-1c activates the insulin promoter through three novel SREBP-binding sites (SREs), two of which overlap with E-boxes, binding sites for BETA2/E47. SREBP-1c activation of the insulin promoter was markedly enhanced by co-expression of BETA2/E47. This synergistic activation by SREBP-1c/BETA2/E47 was not mediated through SREs but through the E-boxes on which BETA2/E47 physically interacts with SREBP-1c, suggesting a novel function of SREBP as a co-activator. These two cis-DNA regions, E1 and E2, with an appropriate distance separating them, were mandatory for the synergism, which implicates formation of SREBP-1c·BETA2·E47 complex in a DNA looping structure for efficient recruitment of CREB-binding protein/p300. However, in the presence of PDX1, the synergistic action of SREBP-1c with BETA2/E47 was canceled. SREBP-1c-mediated activation of the insulin promoter and expression became overt in β cell lines and isolated islets when endogenous PDX-1 expression was low.

Sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are members of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family of transcription factors that regulate fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis (reviewed in Refs. 15Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2916) Google Scholar and 16Brown M.S. Ye J. Rawson R.B. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 2000; 100: 391-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). SREBPs are initially bound to the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane. By virtue of the SREBP cleavage-activating protein/Insig system, SREBP is cleaved in a sterol-dependent manner to liberate the amino-terminal portion containing a basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper domain (nuclear SREBP), which enters the nucleus where it can bind to specific sterol response elements (SREs) in the promoters of target genes. Three isoforms of SREBP, -1a, -1c, and -2, are known. Although SREBP-2 plays a crucial role in the regulation of cholesterol synthesis, SREBP-1c controls the gene expression of lipogenic enzymes (reviewed in Refs. 17Shimano H. Vitam. Horm. 2002; 65: 167-194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 18Horton J.D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 1091-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Nuclear SREBP-2 has a high affinity with classic sterol regulatory elements, which are usually found in the promoters of cholesterogenic genes and the LDL receptor gene. Nuclear SREBP-1 also has broad binding capacity to SRE-like sequences, including E-boxes that are occasionally found in the promoters of lipogenic genes (19Amemiya-Kudo M. Shimano H. Hasty A.H. Yahagi N. Yoshikawa T. Matsuzaka T. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Ohashi K. Osuga J. Harada K. Gotoda T. Sato R. Kimura S. Ishibashi S. Yamada N. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1220-1235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SREBP-1c has been well established as controlling the nutritional regulation of lipogenic genes in the liver (20Shimano H. Yahagi N. Amemiya-Kudo M. Hasty A.H. Osuga J. Tamura Y. Shionoiri F.

However, the role of SREBP-1c in pancreatic β cells is yet to be elucidated. Because an excess of fatty acids or triglycerides could impair the functions of β cells, a potential pathophysiologic consequence of diabetes, often referred to as lipotoxicity, estimation of SREBP-1c in β cell function is an important issue to be addressed. It has been reported that insulin-resistant obese animals have a high expression of SREBP-1c in β cells (21Kakuma T. Lee Y. Higa M. Wang Z. Pan W. Shimomura I. Unger R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the effect of SREBP on insulin gene expression, especially in the context with interaction with β cell-specific transcription factors, has never been investigated. In the current study, we performed promoter analysis on rat insulin promoter I to investigate the potential effects of SREBPs on insulin gene expression in both non-β and β cell lines.

Myc or SREBP antibodies were preincubated with proteins for 60 min before adding the labeled probes. The DNA·protein complex was resolved on a 4.6% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and exposed to the Bioimaging Analyzer System station software (Fuji Photo Film). In Vitro Protein-Protein Interaction Assay—[35S]Methionine-labeled proteins, luciferase, SREBP-1c, ΔTA-SREBP1c, BETA2, and E47 were prepared using the in vitro translation transcription system (Promega). Labeled protein (3 μl) was mixed with 1 μl of Myc antibody bound to 5 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in 200 μlof interaction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with interaction buffer. The bound proteins were eluted with 30 μl of sample buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Bromothymol Blue) and heated 95 °C for 5 min. The bound proteins (15 μl) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.

Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts from HEK293, HIT, and INS1 cells were performed as described by Hua et al. (33Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10379-10384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Two hours prior to cell collection, ALLN (N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinalaldehyde, calpain inhibitor I) (Calbiochem) (25 μg/μl) was added to the cells. After collection, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2,1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA). Pellets were passed through a 26-gauge needle eight times and centrifuged at 1,600 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 20 min, and the membrane-containing pellets were suspended in membrane buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl2, 80 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100). The pellet containing the nuclei was suspended in buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.4 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA), rotated at 4 °C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The protein from the nuclear extract is in the supernatant. All buffers used contain a mixture of protease inhibitors (25 μg/μl ALLN, 10 μg/μl leupeptin, 2.1 μg/μl aprotinin, 5 μg/μl pepstatin, and 5 μg/μl phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Isolation of Rat Islet and Mouse Pancreas—Pancreatic islets of Langerhans were isolated from 18-h-fasting male Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks old) and C57Bl6 mice (12 weeks old) by perfusion of the pancreatic duct and in situ collagenase digestion (34Shapiro A.M. Hao E. Rajotte R.V. Kneteman N.M. Cell Transplant. 1996; 5: 631-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The islets were subsequently purified by Ficoll density gradient and by hand picking. Immediately after isolation, the islets were cultured overnight in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5.5 mm glucose with or without T0901317 (3 μm). Total RNA was prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Immunoblot Analysis—Aliquots of proteins were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and incubated with rabbit anti-mouse SREBP-1 or goat anti-PDX-1 (N-18) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or donkey anti-goat (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and detection of immunoreactive bands was performed using the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assays were performed as previously published with some modification (35Chakrabarti S.K. James J.C. Mirmira R.G. J. Biol.

A total of 3.0 × 107 INS-1 cells (from two confluent 10-cm plates) was cross-linked with formaldehyde (final concentration 1%) after washing with phosphate-buffered saline and incubation for 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding glycine at a final concentration of 0.125 m. After 5 min, the cells were scraped and washed two times with cold phosphate-buffered saline with protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 12.5 μg/ml ALLN, 2.5 μg/μl pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, plus protease inhibitors) and subjected to sonication at setting 10 for six 10-s pulses plus setting 30 for five 10-s pulses to share the chromatin to 1000-bp fragments. The samples were diluted 4-fold with immunoprecipitation dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 167 mm NaCl, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, plus protease inhibitors). To reduce the nonspecific binding, the samples were incubated with 60 μl of sonicated salmon sperm DNA/protein A-Sepharose slurry (Amersham Biosciences) on a rotating platform at 4 °C for 2 h. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with 10 μl of rabbit anti-mouse SREBP-1 antibody and rabbit normal IgG as a negative control and rotated overnight at 4 °C. 0.9 × 107 INS-1 cells for each antibody were used. Immune complexes were collected by adding 20 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein G-Sepharose slurry (Amersham Biosciences) for 4 h with rotation. Samples were subsequently washed using 1.0 ml of wash buffer A (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), wash buffer B (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), wash buffer C (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and wash buffer D (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and eluted by 30-min incubations with 0.5 ml of elution buffer (1% SDS, 50 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm dithiothreitol). NaCl was added to the elution at a final concentration of 0.3 m, and the samples were incubated at 65 °C for 6 h to reverse the formaldehyde-induced cross-linking. DNA and protein were ethanol-precipitated overnight at –20 °C and dissolved in 100 μl of Tris EDTA buffer (pH 7.4). Digestion was performed by the addition 25 μl of proteinase K buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 25 mm EDTA, 1.25% SDS) with 2 μg/μl proteinase K (2 μl), and samples were placed at 55 °C for 1 h. Chromatin DNA was extracted with phenol/CHCl3 followed by ethanol precipitation. Samples were dissolved in 100 μl of Tris EDTA buffer (pH 7.4). 3-μl aliquots were used for PCR analysis. To amplify the rat insulin I promoter region containing SRE1 and SRE2, the following primer sets were used: 5′-TGCTTCATCAGGCCATCTGG-3′ for sense and 5′-GGTAGGCAGATGGCGAGAGGG-3′ for antisense. Primers sets for rat fatty acid synthase promoter regions containing SRE were used as a positive control: 5′-GACGCTCATTGGCCTGG-3′ for sense and 5′-TCTGGAGGCAGACGACAAG-3′ for antisense. The PCR conditions were 5 min at 94 °C and 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C. Following amplification, PCR products were electrophoresed in a 3% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Statistics—Statistical significance was assessed with the Student's t test for unpaired data. Identification of Insulin Gene Promoters as SREBP Targets—As schematized in Fig. 1A, pancreatic β cell-specific cis-elements for the insulin promoter included E-boxes (E1 and E2) as binding sites for bHLH protein heterodimers BETA2/E47, and A-boxes (A1 and A3/4) for a homeobox PDX-1. In the process of searching for glucose/insulin-responsive elements in promoters of nutritionally regulated genes in relation to SREBP regulation, we found that the rat insulin I gene promoter possesses three potential binding sites for nuclear SREBPs putatively designated SRE1, SRE2, and SRE3 (Fig. 1A). Intriguingly, SRE1 and SRE2 were located adjacent to the E1- and E2-boxes with partial overlapping sequences, respectively. The cluster of A1, E1, and SRE1 was tentatively designated as the E1 region and the distal cluster of A3/4, E2, and SRE2 as the E2 region (Fig. 1A). SRE3 was located upstream and in a reverse orientation. These new potential SREBP binding elements are highly conserved in rat II insulin and human insulin gene promoters (37Melloul D. Marshak S. Cerasi E. Diabetologia. 2002; 45: 309-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Luciferase assays in non-β HEK293 and HepG2 cells (data not shown) demonstrated that overexpression of the active form (nuclear) of SREBP-1a markedly and dose-dependently induced the activity of the rat insulin I promoter containing these regions (Ins715-Luc) (Fig. 1B). Strikingly, the activation of Ins715-Luc by nuclear SREBP-1a was even higher than by co-expression of PDX-1 and BETA2, both of which are crucial for β cell-specific and robust expression of the insulin gene (12Ohneda K. Mirmira R.G. Wang J. Johnson J.D. German M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 900-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 38Glick E. Leshkowitz D. Walker M.D. J. Biol.

Among the nuclear SREBP isoforms (referred to as SREBPs, hereafter), SREBP-1a had the highest activity (Fig. 1C). SREBP-1 has been shown to bind both SRE and some E-boxes, low stringent consensus sequences for bHLH proteins"

SpHsp16.0 was able to protect citrate synthase from thermal aggregation at 45 °C with high efficiency. It existed as a hexadecameric globular oligomer near the physiological growth temperature. At elevated temperatures, the oligomer dissociated into small species, probably dimers. The dissociation was completely reversible, and the original oligomer reformed immediately after the temperature dropped. Large complexes of SpHsp16.0 and denatured citrate synthase were observed by size exclusion chromatography and electron microscopy following incubation at 45 °C and then cooling. However, such large complexes did not elute from the size exclusion column incubated at 45 °C. The denatured citrate synthase protected from aggregation was trapped by a GroEL trap mutant at 45 °C. These results suggest that the complex of SpHsp16.0 and denatured citrate synthase at elevated temperatures is in the transient state and has a hydrophobic nature.

Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 64-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). sHsps endow thermotolerance to cells in vivo (2van den I.P.R. Overkamp P. Knauf U. Gaestel M. de Jong W.W.

Compared with other chaperones, they are relatively heterogeneous in sequence and size. They are grouped together based on a conserved domain, the α-crystallin domain, which is named after the α-crystallin of the vertebrate eye lens (7Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A. de Jong W.W. J. Mol. Evol. 1995; 40: 238-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The α-crystallin domain is preceded by a highly variable N-terminal region and is followed by a short, partly conserved C-terminal extension (8Leroux M.R. Ma B.J. Batelier G. Melki R. Candido E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12847-12853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Although all sHsps exist as large oligomeric complexes, their quaternary structures are diverse and are composed of 9–40 subunits (9Buchner J. Ehrnsperger M. Gaestel M. Walke S. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To date, the three-dimensional crystal structures of MjHsp16.5, a sHsp from hyperthermophilic archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii, and Hsp16.9, a sHsp from wheat, have been determined. MjHsp16.5 forms a hollow spherical complex of 24 subunits (10Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), whereas Hsp16.9 exists as a dodecameric double disk (11van Montfort R.L. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The crystal structures show that the α-crystallin domain is composed of β-strands, and the two proteins utilize a similar dimer as a higher assembly building block but differ in their quaternary structure. In contrast, some members of the sHsp family like α-crystallin are remarkably polydisperse (12Haley D.A. Bova M.P. Huang Q.L. McHaourab H.S. Stewart P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). It has been revealed that the molecular mechanism of the chaperone function of sHsps resides in the oligomeric structure. The chaperone potential of sHsps is latent when they exist as large oligomeric structures under physiological conditions. At elevated temperatures, the equilibrium shifts to the dissociated sate, and the hidden hydrophobic substrate-binding sites are exposed to express chaperone activity (13Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In the presence of denatured proteins, small oligomers form a large stable complex to protect against aggregation. Recently, Fu et al. (14Fu X. Zhang H. Zhang X. Cao Y. Jiao W. Liu C. Song Y. Abulimiti A. Chang Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6337-6348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) have shown that a mutant of Hsp16.3 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with nine residues missing from the C terminus that cannot form a large oligomeric complex exhibits chaperone activity at low temperatures. The large substrate-sHsp complexes are dissociated to renature by the action of the DnaK system or more efficiently by the cooperation of DnaK and ClpB system (15Lee G.J. Vierling E.

In the absence of denatured proteins, dissociated small complexes reassemble into a large oligomer after a shift to physiological temperatures. In the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, two small heat shock protein genes (SPCC338.06c and SPBC3E7.02c) have been identified. Expression of SpHsp16.0 (SPBC3E7.02c) is induced by a number of experimental stimuli including heat shock. In addition, its expression is also responsive to depletion of deoxyribonucleotides or DNA damage, and this response is dependent on the spc1 MAPK pathway and the transcription factor atf1 (20Taricani L. Feilotter H.E. Weaver C. Young P.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3030-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). SPCC338.06c encodes sHsp with the molecular mass of 15,806 Da, which shares 34.8% amino acid sequence identity with SpHsp16.0. It is also induced by heat shock. 3M. Hirose, H. Tohda, Y. Giga-Hama, R.

However, their biochemical characterizations have not been performed previously. In this study, we have expressed and characterized SpHsp16.0. Similar to other sHsps, it existed as a large oligomeric complex and dissociated into small oligomers at elevated temperatures to function as a molecular chaperone. It formed a large complex with a denatured protein after heat incubation like other sHsps. We found that the complex of SpHsp16.0 and denatured protein was in a different state at elevated temperatures. It seems to be in the transient state and have a hydrophobic nature. By fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy, the interactions of SpHsp16.0 and a denatured protein at different conditions were compared. Proteins, Reagents, and Strains—Ex Taq DNA polymerase, restriction enzymes, and other reagents for gene manipulation were obtained from TAKARA Bio Inc. (Shiga, Japan). Citrate synthase (CS) from porcine heart was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. GFP was purified as described previously (21Iizuka R. Yoshida T. Maruyama T. Shomura Y. Miki K. Yohda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 1118-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A bacterial chaperonin GroEL trap mutant (D398A-GroEL) (GroELtrap) was used to trap an unfolded protein (22Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Fluorescent labeling of SpHsp16.0 and CS was performed using BODIPY-FL (4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-propionic acid) succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and Cy5 Mono-reactive Dye(Amersham Biosciences).Other reagents were the products of Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan). S. pombe ARC032 (972h–) was used for preparation of the genomic DNA. Escherichia coli strains DH5α and BL21(DE3) were used for plasmid construction and protein expression, respectively. Expression and Purification of SpHsp16.0—Because the gene is not split by introns, a full-length gene for SpHsp16.0 was amplified from the total genomic DNA of S. pombe ARC032 by PCR using as primers 5′-CCC-ATA-TGT-CTT-TGC-AAC-CTT-TTT-T-3′ and 5′-GGG-AAT-TCT-TAC-TTA-ATA-GCA-ATT-TGT-T-3′ and then subcloned into the pT7Blue T vector. After confirmation of the sequence, the gene was excised with NdeI and EcoRI and then introduced into the NdeI/EcoRI site of pET23b to construct pSpHsp16.0E. E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pSpHsp16.0E was grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml of ampicillin. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,600 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The harvested cells were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and disrupted by sonication. Then the suspension of disrupted cells was centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Toyopearl anion exchange column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with buffer A. The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing SpHsp16.0 were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra, Millipore, Billerica, MA), and then applied to a UnoQ6 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with buffer A. The proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing SpHsp16.0 were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon Ultra), and then applied to a HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200-pg size exclusion column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 150 mm NaCl). Fractions containing SpHsp16.0 were collected and then concentrated by ultrafiltration. Thermal Aggregation Measurements—Thermal aggregation of CS from porcine heart was monitored by measuring light scattering at 500 nm with a spectrofluorometer (FP-6500; Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) at 45 °C. Native CS (150 nm, monomer) was incubated in the assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) with or without SpHsp16.0. The assay buffer was preincubated at 45 °C and continuously stirred throughout the measurement. Effect of SpHsp16.0 on Spontaneous Refolding of GFP—GFP was denatured by incubation in acidic buffer (100 mm HCl, 50 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) for 30 min at room temperature. Refolding was started by diluting the denatured GFP to be 50 nm in the dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) without or with SpHsp16.0 (100 nm or 10 μm). The fluorescence of the refolded GFP was monitored at 510 nm with excitation at 400 nm using a spectrofluorophotometer (FP-6500) with continuous stirring at 45 °C. Electron Microscopy—An aliquot of SpHsp16.0 or SpHsp16.0-CS complex solution was applied onto specimen grids covered with a thin carbon support film, which had been made hydrophilic by the ion spattering device (HDT-400; JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) and then negatively stained with 1% uranyl acetate for 30 s. The images were recorded by making use of a slow scan CCD camera (Gatan Retractable Multiscan camera) under low electron dose conditions at a magnification of 50,000× in an electron microscope (Tecnai F20; Philips Electron Optics, Hillsboro, OR) operated at 120 kV. The images were analyzed on computers using digital micrography. Size Exclusion Chromatography-Multi-angle Light Scattering (SEC-MALS)—The purified SpHsp16.0 complex was analyzed by SEC-MALS on a TSKgel G3000XL column (Tosoh) connected with a multi-angle light scattering detector (MINI DAWN; Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA) and a differential refractive index detector (Shodex RI-101; Showa Denko, Tokyo, Japan) by a HPLC system, PU-980i (JASCO). A 100-μl aliquot of sample was injected into the column and eluted with buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 1.0 ml/min. The molecular mass and protein concentration were determined according to the instructional manual (23Wyatt P.J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Size Exclusion Chromatography at Elevated Temperatures—Size exclusion chromatography was performed with a column, SB-804HQ (Showa Denko), using a HPLC system, PU-1580i, connected with a multi-wavelength detector MD1515 (JASCO). The purified SpHsp16.0 was diluted to 4 μm in buffer B. A 100-μl aliquot of diluted SpHsp16.0 was heated at the specified temperature for 60 min and then loaded on the column heated at the same temperature. Elution was performed with buffer C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. To examine the reversibility of the dissociation, SpHsp16.0 heated at 45 °C was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography at room temperature after cooling at 4 °C for 30 min. Labeling SpHsp16.0 and CS with Fluorescent Dyes—Before labeling, both SpHsp16.0 and CS were gel-filtrated on a NAP5 column (Sephadex G-25; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5. Then 200 μl of SpHsp16.0 (3 mg/ml) was mixed with 5 μl of 1 m K2CO3 to pH 8.5. Subsequently, BODIPY-FL succinimidyl ester was added to the mixture to 121 μm and incubated for 3 h at room temperature. After the reaction, unreacted BODIPY-FL succinimidyl ester was removed by gel filtration with a NAP5 column. After mixing 200 μl of CS (22.4 μm) with 20 μl of 1 m Na2HPO4 to pH 9.0, Cy5 monoreactive dye (Amersham Biosciences) was added to 83 μm, and the mixture was incubated for 3 h at room temperature. Then the unreacted Cy5 monoreactive dye was removed by gel filtration with a NAP5 column. The fluorescent-labeled SpHsp16.0 and CS were designated BODIPY-SpHsp16.0 and Cy5-CS, respectively. BODYPY-SpHsp16.0 exhibited almost same chaperone activity as SpHsp16.0 without modification. Analysis of SpHsp16.0-CS Complex by Size Exclusion Chromatography—The interaction in the native structure was examined by size exclusion chromatography at room temperature. A mixture of 1 μm SpHsp16.0 and 0.2 μm Cy5-CS in buffer B was analyzed with a size exclusion column, SB-804HQ, using a HPLC system PU-1580i with buffer B delivered at the flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Proteins and Cy5-CS were monitored at the absorbance at 220 and 650 nm, respectively. SpHsp16.0-CS complex was analyzed as follows. SpHsp16.0 solution (1 μm) was heated at 45 °C from 5 min, and the Cy5-CS was added to 0.2 μm. After further incubation at 45 °C, the mixture was analyzed on the column at 45 °C or at room temperature after cooling on ice for 30 min. To examine whether other chaperone can rob denatured CS from SpHsp16.0, GroELtrap was added to the mixture of SpHsp16.0 and Cy5-CS to 1 μm (as tetradecamer) after 30 min of incubation at 45 °C. The mixture was analyzed on the column at 45 °C. FCS and FCCS Measurement—FCS and FCCS measurements were carried out with a ConfoCor2 (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), which consisted of a CW Ar+ laser and helium-neon laser, a water immersion objective (C-Apochromat, 40×, 1.2 NA, Carl Zeiss), and two channels of avalanche photodiodes (SPCM-200-PQ; EG&G). BODIPY-FL was excited at 488 nm, and Cy5 was excited at 633 nm. The confocal pinhole diameter was adjusted to 90 μm for 633 nm and 50 μm for 488 nm. The emission signals were split by a dichroic mirror (635-nm beam splitter) and detected at 505–550 nm by the green channel for BODIPY-FL and through a 650-nm-long path filter by the red channel for Cy5. Measurement was performed using 0.2 μm BODIPY-SpHsp16.0 and 0.05 μm Cy5-CS solutions in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5. To measure FCS, 100 μl of each labeled protein solution was used for the measurements separately at room temperature or at 42 °C after 5 min of incubation at 45 °C. FCCS at room temperature was measured using 100 μl of the mixture of both labeled proteins. To examine the interaction at 42 °C, 0.2 μm BODIPY-SpHsp16.0 was incubated at 45 °C for 5 min, and then Cy5-CS was added to 0.05 μm. After a further 5-min incubation at 45 °C, 100 μl of the mixture was subjected to FCCS at 42 °C. The large complex of BODIPY-SpHsp16.0 and Cy5-CS was formed by cooling the mixture at 4 °C for 4 min after 5 min of incubation at 45 °C, and then the FCCS measurement was performed at room temperature. Data Analysis of FCS and FCCS—The fluorescence autocorrelation functions of the red and green channels, Gr(τ) and Gg(τ), and the fluorescence cross-correlation function, Gc(τ), are calculated using Equation 1, Gx(τ)=〈δIi(t)·δIi(t+τ)〉〈Ii(t)〉〈Ij(t)〉(Eq. 1) where τ denotes the time delay, Ii is the fluorescence intensity of the red channel (i = r) or green channel (i = g), and Gr(τ), Gg(τ), and Gc(τ) denote the auto correlation function of red (i = j = x = r), green (i = j = x = g), and cross-correlation (i = r, j = g, and x = c), respectively. Acquired Gx(τ) were fitted by a one-, two-, or three-component model as shown in Equation 2, Gx(τ)=1+1N∑iFi1+ττi-11+τs2τi-1/2(Eq. 2) where Fi and τi are the fraction and diffusion time of component i, respectively. N is the average number of fluorescent particles in the excitation-detection volume defined by radius wo and length 2zo, and s is the structure parameter representing the ratio s = zo/wo. The pinhole adjustment of the FCS setup, structural parameter, and detection volume were calibrated for 488- and 633-nm excitation using FCS measurements of rhodamin 6G and Cy5 solution, respectively, with a concentration of 10–7m. Molecular masses of labeled protein could be evaluated with the Stokes-Einstein equation relation for a spherical molecule and with the molecular masses of rhodamin 6G or Cy5 as references (24Pack C.G. Nishimura G. Tamura M. Aoki K. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. Kinjo M. Cytometry. 1999; 36: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The average number of red fluorescent particles (Nr) and green fluorescent particles (Ng), and particles that have both red and green fluorescence (Nc) can be calculated with Nr = 1/Gr (0), Ng = 1/Gg (0), and Nc = Gc(0)/Gr(0)Gg(0), respectively. When Nr and Ng are constant, Gc (0) is directly proportional to Nc. For a quantitative evaluation of the cross-correlation among various samples, Gc(0) is normalized by Gr(0) (cross-ratio; Gc(0)/Gr(0)) (25Saito K. Wada I. Tamura M. Kinjo M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). SpHsp16.0 Efficiently Protects Porcine Heart Citrate Synthase from Thermal Aggregation but Cannot Arrest Spontaneous Refolding of Acid-denaturedGFP—In S. pombe, two small heat shock protein genes have been identified. Among them, expression of SPBC3E7.02c is highly induced by a number of experimental stimuli including heat shock. It is named SpHsp16.0 from its deduced molecular mass of 15,967 Da. To examine whether SpHsp16.0 possesses molecular chaperone activity, its effect on the thermal aggregation of CS from porcine heart were examined. As shown in Fig. 1A, SpHsp16.0 efficiently prevented the thermal aggregation of CS. An excess of SpHsp16.0 monomer of ∼2 mol was enough to suppress the increase in light scattering, which coincides well with previous observations obtained with sHsps from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (13Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 17Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). These results support the notion that sHsps function as dimers under heat-stressed conditions. Then we examined the effects of SpHsp16.0 on the spontaneous refolding of GFP. Chaperonin or prefoldin can capture the folding intermediate of acid denatured GFP and arrest its spontaneous refolding (26Okochi M. Yoshida T. Maruyama T. Kawarabayasi Y. Kikuchi H. Yohda M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 27Yoshida T. Kawaguchi R. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. Yasunaga T. Wakabayashi T. Yohda M. Maruyama T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SpHsp16.0 could not suppress the increase of fluorescence even in the presence of a 200-fold excess (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that the complex of SpHsp16.0 and denatured protein is not stable as observed for other chaperones. Oligomeric Structure of SpHsp16.0—Size exclusion chromatography of the purified SpHsp16.0 revealed that it existed as an oligomer. Electron microscopic image of negatively stained SpHsp16.0 showed that it existed as a spherical particle (Fig. 2A). The diameter was estimated to be less than 15 nm. The size is almost the same as that of Hsp26 from S. cerevisiae (13Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Then we determined the molecular mass of the oligomer by SEC-MALS. The molecular mass of the oligomer was calculated to be 250 kDa (Fig. 2B). Thus, the SpHsp16.0 oligomer is likely to be composed of 16 subunits. Temperature-dependent Oligomeric Structural Change of SpHsp16.0—It is postulated that the oligomeric dissociation of sHsp is prerequisite for exposure of the substrate-binding site and then molecular chaperone functions (11van Montfort R.L. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 13Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S.

Chang Z. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have examined the dissociation of the complex by size exclusion chromatography on HPLC at elevated temperatures. Because we could not observeanystructuralchangewhenthesampleswereappliedtoacolumnkept at room temperature, analyses were performed with the column heated to the temperature of the sample. As shown in Fig. 3A, we observed a temperature-dependent dissociation of the oligomer. At 45 °C, all of the large oligomers disappeared and small complexes appeared. The dissociation is reversible as shown in Fig. 3B. The SpHsp16 oligomer was completely dissociated into small oligomers at 45 °C. The small oligomers immediately disappeared, and the original oligomeric complex reappeared when the sample was cooled. The dissociation equilibrium is also affected by the concentration as observed for Hsp27 (31Shashidharamurthy R. Koteiche H.A. Dong J. McHaourab H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5281-5289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Therefore, we were unable to determine the molecular mass of the small dissociated oligomers by SEC-MALS because of the limit of sensitivity. Interaction between SpHsp16.0 and Heat-denatured CS—Then interaction between SpHsp16.0 and CS was examined by size exclusion chromatography and electron microscopy. When the mixture of SpHsp16.0 and CS labeled with Cy5 (Cy5-CS) was applied to the size exclusion column without heat treatment, two clearly separated peaks appeared (Fig. 4A). The high molecular mass peak corresponds to the SpHsp16.0 oligomer, and the low molecular mass peak corresponds to Cy5-CS (Fig. 4A, dotted line). Then SpHsp16.0 was incubated with Cy5-CS at 45 °C for 30 min and cooled at 4 °C for 30 min. This mixture was analyzed by size exclusion chromatography at room temperature. Broad and sharp peaks composed of both proteins appeared at shorter elution times (Fig. 4B). The large complexes were analyzed by electron microscopy. Various sized elliptical particles of 25–37.5 nm in the major axis, larger than the spherical particles of the SpHsp16.0 oligomer, were observed (Fig. 5). SpHsp16.0 likely binds to non-native CS to form complexes of variable size and shape like other sHsps (13Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 17Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J.

The size exclusion chromatography fraction corresponds to the large complex of SpHsp16.0 and CS obtained in the same procedure as for Fig. 6C was used for electron microscopy. The bar represents 50 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Then we examined the complex of SpHsp16.0 and Cy5-CS by the column heated at 45 °C. Unexpectedly, we could not observe any large complexes of SpHsp16.0 and Cy5-CS (Fig. 4C). Moreover, most of SpHsp16.0 and Cy5-CS were lost, and only small peaks were observed. The proteins were eluted from the column afterward by washing with ethylene glycol, which is thought to weaken hydrophobic interaction (data not shown). The result suggests that the complex of SpHsp16.0 and Cy5-CS is in the transient state and has hydrophobic nature at elevated temperatures. The observed stable large complex of SpHsp16.0 and CS is likely to be formed after the shift to the nonstress temperature. To examine the state of the complex at the elevated temperatures, we examined whether GroEL trap mutant (GroELtrap, D398A-GroEL) can rob the denatured Cy5-CS from SpHsp16.0. GroELtrap can capture an unfolded protein but is unable to renature it in an ATP-dependent manner (22Rye H.S. Burston S.G. Fenton W.A. Beechem J.M. Xu Z. Sigler P.B. Horwich A.L. Nature. 1997; 388: 792-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4D, most of the fluorescence intensity of Cy5-CS was observed at the position where GroELtrap appeared, indicating that the complex of SpHsp16.0 and denatured Cy5-CS is not stable in the elevated temperature, and binding of denatured protein is likely to be in the dynamic equilibrium state. Detection of Interaction between SpHsp16.0 and CS at Elevated Temperature by FCS and FCCS—We did not observe a complex of SpHsp16.0 and CS at elevated temperatures by size exclusion chromatography or other methods probably because the complex is in the transient state and also because of the highly hydrophobic nature of the complex. FCS is used to analyze the interaction of proteins in solution (33Rigler R. Mets U. Widengern P. Kask P. Eur. Biophys. J. 1993; 22: 169-175Crossref Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 34Pack C.G. Aoki K. Taguchi H. Yoshida M. Kinjo M. Tamura M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It provides information about the diffusion properties of fluorescently tagged target molecules at a very low concentration (pm). FCS measurements are based on single photon counting of fluorescence in a defined detection volume (∼0.25 fl) generated by a laser beam and fine detection optics. The diffusion constant and the concentration of target molecule can be determined from the autocorrelation function (G(τ)), allowing us to monitor the interaction in situ. Fig. 6 (A and B) shows the results of FCS analyses of BODIPY-SpHsp16.0 and Cy5-CS at room temperature and 42 °C. Molecular masses were estimated from the calculated diffusion time using the Einstein-Stokes equation with rhodamin 6G or Cy5 as a standard. At room temperature, the diffusion times of rhodamin 6G, Cy5, BODIPY-SpHsp16.0, and Cy5-CS were 26, 42, 241, and 224 μs, respectively. So the molecular masses of BODIPY-SpHsp16.0 and Cy5-CS were calculated to be 384 and 119 kDa, respectively. Although these values do not exactly match the molecular masses of the SpHsp16.0 hexadecamer (250 kDa) and CS dimer (98 kDa) determined by SEC-MALS or calculated from the amino acid sequences, they reflect well the quaternary structures. When the temperature was increased to 42 °C, both proteins exhibited a dramatic change in diffusion time. The diffusion time of BODIPY-SpHsp16.0 was 103 μs (corrected for room temperature). Cy5-CS was composed of three components whose diffusion times were 589, 137, and 80 μs. Their distribution ratios were estimated to be 70, 20, and 10%, respectively. The estimated molecular mass of BODIPY-SpHsp16.0 decreased to 30.4 kDa, almost the same as the molecular mass of the dimer, 32 kDa. In contrast, the quaternary structure of CS was not uniform. The molecular mass of the main component is calculated to be ∼2200 kDa, which is consistent with the formation of an aggregate. An extended technique of FCS, FCCS, can detect the coincidence of two spectrally distinct fluorescent probes in a small detection area at very low concentrations. FCCS has been used to detect the association-dissociation reaction and interaction between two molecular species. When 100 μl of a mixture containing BODIPY-SpHsp16 (0.2 μm as monomer) and Cy5-CS (0.05 μm as monomer) was observed at room temperature, almost no cross-correlation between them was observed at room temperature (Gc(0)/Gr(0) = 0.002) (Fig. 6C). No specific cross-correlation between BODIPY-SpHsp16.0 and only Cy5 dye was observed at room temperature, at 45 °C with cooling to 4 °C, and at 42 °C, respectively (data not shown). By contrast, a significant cross-correlation (Gc(0)/Gr(0) = 0.15) was observed when they were incubated at 45 °C and cooled to 4 °C (Fig. 4C). The result coincides with the formation of a large complex. Then we performed FCCS at 42 °C, the upper temperature limit of the thermostatted stage of the system. Although the efficiency was relatively low, SpHsp16.0 could suppress the thermal aggregation of CS at that temperature (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 6C, a cross-correlation between them was clearly detected (Gc(0)/Gr(0) = 0.08). The interaction was not as tight as that observed for the large oligomeric complexes obtained after the temperature shift. Thus, we concluded that the complex of SpHsp16.0 and denatured CS should be different from that observed after the temperature drop. SpHsp16.0 shares almost the same characteristics as other sHsps studied so far. It exists as a large oligomeric complex and dissociated into small oligomers at elevated temperatures. The dissociation is completely reversible in the absence of denatured protein. At the medium temperatures, SpHsp16.0 eluted as broad peaks between the original complex and dissociated species, suggesting that SpHsp16.0 was in the equilibrium between complex and dissociation states. The dissociation equilibrium was also affected by the concentration. We could not determine the molecular mass of the dissociated species by SEC-MALS because they were observed only the concentration is low. Molecular mass estimated from the diffusion constant observed by FCS suggests that the small species is dimer. However, further study would be required to determine the structure of sHsp in the dissociated state. SpHsp16.0 forms a large complex with CS after the heat incubation and cooling. The complex was stable and did not dissociate spontaneously (data not shown). We could not observe such large complexes of SpHsp16.0 and denatured CS by size exclusion chromatography at 45 °C in spite of the fact that the stable large complex was separated by the column. The result seems to contradict with the previous result of Hsp26 that large complexes with denatured proteins were observed by native PAGE at the high temperature (13Haslbeck M. Walke S. Stromer T. Ehrnsperger M. White H.E. Chen S. Saibil H.R. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6744-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The difference is likely to be caused by the hydrophobic nature of the complex at the high temperature. In our experiment, large portions of SpHsp16.0 and CS were lost during size exclusion chromatography, probably by the hydrophobic interaction. Stable large complexes obtained after the temperature drop did not exhibit such hydrophobic nature, and they eluted quantitatively in size exclusion chromatography. The difference in the characteristics of the complexes before and after cooling was also observed by FCCS. Compared with the stable complex, the interaction between SpHsp16.0 and Cy5-CS of the complex at the elevated temperature is relatively weak. The hydrophobic nature and the relatively weak interaction suggest that the complex is in the transient state. Binding between SpHsp16.0 and denatured proteins should be in the dynamic equilibrium, resulting in that the surface of the complex is hydrophobic. It is also confirmed by the fact that denatured CS that is protected from aggregation is captured by GroELtrap. Incompetence of capturing folding intermediate of GFP is also likely to be due to the same reason because acid denatured GFP folds relatively rapidly compared with de novo folding. We monitored the decrease of CS activity at 45 °C in the absence or presence of 4-fold molar excess SpHsp16.0 (data not shown). CS activity decreased with the incubation time and was almost completely lost after 5 min of incubation. Similar to the result obtained with Hsp25 (17Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), the presence of SpHSp16.0 had almost no effect on thermal inactivation of CS, even though it can prevent their thermal aggregation. Thus, we think that SpHsp16.0 binds with CS in the irreversibly unfolded state. Recently, Franzmann et al. (35Franzmann T.M. Wühr K. Richter K. Walter S. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 1083-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) reported that dissociation of the oligomer is not required for activation of Hsp26. They propose existence of two alternative conformations for the Hsp26 oligomer with different affinities for unfolded proteins. Even though we could not observe such conformational changes of SpHsp16.0 oligomers at elevated temperatures, the existence of SpHsp16.0-substrate complex in the transient state with high affinity implies the presence of the conformation with high affinity. To reveal the molecular mechanism of chaperone activity of small heat shock proteins, structural and functional characterization of the complex in the transient state would be necessary. Because it is difficult to characterize the transient complex by conventional methods because of high hydrophobicity, we believe that FCS and FCCS are important tools for further study.

https://openalex.org/W1979990772,"In many species, binding of sperm to the egg initiates cortical granule exocytosis, an event that contributes to a sustained block of polyspermy. Interestingly, cortical granule exocytosis can be elicited in immature Xenopus oocytes by the protein kinase C activator, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate. In this study, we investigated the role of cysteine string protein (csp) in phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-evoked cortical granule exocytosis. Prior work indicated that csp is associated with cortical granules of Xenopus oocytes. In oocytes exhibiting >20-fold overexpression of full-length Xenopus csp, cortical granule exocytosis was reduced by ∼80%. However, csp overexpression did not affect constitutive exocytosis. Subcellular fractionation and confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that little or none of the overexpressed csp was associated with cortical granules. This accumulation of csp at sites other than cortical granules suggested that mislocalized csp might sequester a protein that is important for regulated exocytosis. Because the NH2-terminal region of csp includes a J-domain, which interacts with constitutively expressed 70-kDa heat shock proteins (Hsc 70), we evaluated the effect of overexpressing the J-domain of csp. Although the native J-domain of csp inhibited cortical granule exocytosis, point mutations that interfere with J-domain binding to Hsc 70 eliminated this inhibition. These data indicate that csp interaction with Hsc 70 molecular chaperones is vital for regulated secretion in Xenopus oocytes. In many species, binding of sperm to the egg initiates cortical granule exocytosis, an event that contributes to a sustained block of polyspermy. Interestingly, cortical granule exocytosis can be elicited in immature Xenopus oocytes by the protein kinase C activator, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate. In this study, we investigated the role of cysteine string protein (csp) in phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-evoked cortical granule exocytosis. Prior work indicated that csp is associated with cortical granules of Xenopus oocytes. In oocytes exhibiting >20-fold overexpression of full-length Xenopus csp, cortical granule exocytosis was reduced by ∼80%. However, csp overexpression did not affect constitutive exocytosis.

Although the native J-domain of csp inhibited cortical granule exocytosis, point mutations that interfere with J-domain binding to Hsc 70 eliminated this inhibition. These data indicate that csp interaction with Hsc 70 molecular chaperones is vital for regulated secretion in Xenopus oocytes. Eggs of many species exhibit cortical granule exocytosis, an early postfertilization event that leads to a sustained block of polyspermy (1Schuel H. Gamete Res. 1978; 1: 299-382Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Although oocytes of Xenopus laevis must undergo maturation before sperm can elicit cortical granule exocytosis, immature oocytes (and eggs) of Xenopus secrete in response to activators of protein kinase C (2Bement W.M. Capco D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Somewhat unexpectedly (given that the majority of regulated secretory events are initiated by an increase of cytosolic Ca2+, Refs. 3Burgoyne R.D. Morgan A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 305-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar and 4Augustine G.J. Burns M.E. DeBello W.M. Pettit D.L. Schweizer F.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 659-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), cortical granule exocytosis in Xenopus oocytes is insensitive to changes of cytosolic Ca2+. For instance, this secretory event is not triggered by Ca2+ ionophores (using physiological concentrations of Ca2+); it cannot be evoked by direct injection of Ca2+ into the cytoplasm, and it is unaffected by removal of extracellular Ca2+ + or by buffers that clamp cytosolic Ca2+ below the resting level (5Bement W.M. Capco D.G. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 6Charbonneau M. Grey R.D. Dev. Biol. 1984; 102: 90-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 7Kohan S.A. Gundersen C.B. J. Exp. Zool. 2003; 300: 113-125Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Thus, oocytes offer an empirical avenue for assessing the function of proteins in a secretory pathway where calcium ions play no direct role. This issue is of considerable importance with respect to cysteine string proteins (csp 2The abbreviations used are: csp, cysteine string protein; PMA, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate.(s)), a class of proteins found associated with a broad range of regulated secretory organelles (8Buchner E.

Csp was originally identified as a novel synaptic antigen in Drosophila (11Zinsmaier K.E. Hofbauer A. Heimbeck G. Pflugfelder G.O. Buchner S. Buchner E. J. Neurogenet. 1990; 7: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and several subsequent investigations indicated that csp might be important as a modulator of presynaptic Ca2+ channels (12Gundersen C.B.

Physiol. 2002; 538: 383-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, it also became evident that regulation of presynaptic Ca2+ channels was not the sole function of csp (8Buchner E. Gundersen C.B. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 223-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. J.

For instance, with the recognition that the majority of the cysteine residues of csp were fatty acylated (18Gundersen C.B. Mastrogiacomo A. Faull K. Umbach J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19197-19199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was proposed that this unusual hydrophobic domain of csp might participate directly in membrane fusion (19Gundersen C.B. Mastrogiacomo A. Umbach J.A. J. Theor. Biol. 1995; 172: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Empirical evidence for a role of csp in membrane fusion emerged from amperometric recordings of chromaffin cells overexpressing csp. This study revealed a change in the rise time of amperometric spikes, thereby implicating csp in fusion pore expansion (20Graham M.E. Burgoyne R.D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1281-1289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Complementing this work, genetic experiments indicated that the cysteine string of csp could not be truncated or functionally substituted by serine residues (21Arnold C. Reisch N. Leibold C. Becker S. Prufert. K. Sautter K. Palm D. Jatzke S. Buchner. S. Buchner E. J. Exp. Zool. 2004; 207: 1323-1334Google Scholar). Concurrently, strategies to perturb csp function in pancreatic and adrenal cells suggested that csp was involved at an undisclosed step of secretion downstream of Ca2+ entry into the cell (22Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2259-2267Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 23Brown H. Larsson O. Branstrom R. Yang S. Leibiger B. Leibiger I. Fried G. Moede T. Deeney J.T. Brown G.R. Jacobsson G. Rhodes C.J. Braun J.E.A. Scheller R.H. Corkey B.E. Berggren P. Meister B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5048-5058Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 24Zhang H. Kelley W.L. Chamberlain L.H. Burgoyne R.D. Wollheim C. Lang J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 267-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Studies of a csp null mutant Drosophila yielded a specific hypothesis for this downstream role of csp. Based on an apparent change of Ca2+ homeostasis and the level of Ca2+ needed to trigger quantal secretion, csp was ascribed a role in regulating the Ca2+ sensitivity of the exocytotic machinery (25Dawson-Scully K. Bronk P. Atwood H.L. Zinsmaier K.E. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6039-6047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In view of these disparate and occasionally conflicting ideas regarding the molecular role(s) of csp, we initiated studies of csp function using Xenopus oocytes. Xenopus oocytes offer several advantages for studying regulated secretion. As noted, cortical granule exocytosis is a one-time secretory event that can be triggered in a Ca2+-independent manner by the protein kinase C activator, PMA (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate). Secretion can be assayed using single oocytes (7Kohan S.A. Gundersen C.B. J. Exp. Zool. 2003; 300: 113-125Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 26Gundersen C.B. Aguado F. Sou S. Mastrogiacomo A. Coppola T. Kornblum H.I. Umbach J.A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 303: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Moreover, oocytes readily express protein from injected mRNA (27Gurdon J.B. Lane C.D. Woodland H.R. Marbaix G. Nature. 1971; 233: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 28Lane C.D. Colman A. Mohun T. Morser J. Champion J. Kourides I. Craig R. Higgins S.

Physiol. 1999; 113: 507-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and protein expression and secretion can be correlated for the same cell (7Kohan S.A. Gundersen C.B. J. Exp. Zool. 2003; 300: 113-125Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 26Gundersen C.B. Aguado F. Sou S. Mastrogiacomo A. Coppola T. Kornblum H.I. Umbach J.A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 303: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Finally, oocytes possess efficient mechanisms for the delivery of proteins to the plasma membrane (and the extracellular compartment, Refs. 28Lane C.D. Colman A. Mohun T. Morser J. Champion J. Kourides I. Craig R. Higgins S. James T.C. Applebaum S.W. Ohlsson R.I. Paucha E. Houghton M. Matthews J. Miflin B.J. Eur. J.

Loo D.D.F. Kreman M. Eskandari S. Wright E.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 507-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which enables one to compare the machinery underlying the regulated and constitutive secretory pathways. Thus, we evaluated the impact on cortical granule exocytosis of overexpressing full-length Xenopus csp. Although we surmised that an elevated cellular content of csp might enhance the kinetics of secretion, instead, we observed a profound reduction of cortical granule exocytosis. Further investigation revealed that little or none of the overexpressed csp was localized to cortical granules. This result raised the possibility that the inhibition of cortical granule exocytosis was because of a non-productive association between the overexpressed csp and one or more csp-interacting proteins. We present evidence that the interaction of overexpressed csp with Hsc 70 (constitutively expressed heat shock protein of 70 kDa) figures prominently in the inhibition of cortical granule exocytosis in these cells. Isolation and Culturing of Oocytes, RNA Preparation, and Injection—Stage V–VI X. laevis oocytes were obtained by collagenase treatment of fragments of ovary as described (31Gundersen C.B. Kohan S.A. Chen Q. Iagnemma J. Umbach J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA transcripts were prepared from linearized constructs subcloned into the plasmid pCS2+ using the SP6 mMessage Machine from Ambion. Oocytes were injected with 30–60 ng of RNA and cultured for 2–4 days at 18 °C prior to the analysis of secretory events. Preparation of csp Constructs—Linearized (NotI) full-length Xenopus csp cDNA (32Mastrogiacomo A. Kornblum H.I. Umbach J.A. Gundersen C.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 239-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) was either used directly to prepare RNA (Xcsp RNA), or it served as a template for the generation by PCR of the J-domain construct (amino acid residues 1–70). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate the J-domain mutations H43Q and D45A. The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-csp construct was kindly supplied by H. E. Yu and W. M. Bement (University of Wisconsin, Madison). All constructs were verified by nucleotide sequence analysis. Regulated Secretion Assay—Cortical granule exocytosis was evoked by exposing single oocytes to PMA (50–100 nm in Barths solution) for 20–30 min followed by Coomassie staining and densitometric analysis of released protein after resolution on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (7Kohan S.A. Gundersen C.B. J. Exp. Zool. 2003; 300: 113-125Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 31Gundersen C.B. Kohan S.A. Chen Q. Iagnemma J. Umbach J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Independently, we developed a procedure to trigger cortical granule exocytosis that appears to involve a protein-independent effect of Ca2+ at the plasma membrane of the oocyte. This was achieved by exposing immature, stage V–VI oocytes to the calcium ionophore, ionomycin (10 μm), in Barths solution with added calcium chloride (20 mm). Secretion triggered in this manner is unaffected by overexpression of a dominant-negative fragment of Xenopus myosin IC, or by pretreatment of oocytes with N-ethylmaleimide (10 mm) or phenylarsine oxide (50 μm), all of which completely block exocytosis triggered by PMA in immature oocytes (data not shown). We used this high Ca2+-ionomycin method of evoking cortical granule exocytosis to assess whether intact cortical granules were still present in oocytes expressing recombinant csp. Immunoblot Analysis of Oocytes—To detect the expression of csp, csp constructs or Hsc 70 (using Hsp 70 monoclonal antibody, clone BRM-22 from Sigma) in oocytes, individual cells were extracted in 20–40 μl of 1% Triton X-100 in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and the extract was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 min. The supernatant was mixed with 5× concentrated Laemmli sample buffer and resolved on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel for immunoblot analysis as before (7Kohan S.A. Gundersen C.B. J. Exp. Zool. 2003; 300: 113-125Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 26Gundersen C.B. Aguado F. Sou S. Mastrogiacomo A. Coppola T. Kornblum H.I. Umbach J.A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 303: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 31Gundersen C.B. Kohan S.A. Chen Q. Iagnemma J. Umbach J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An antibody specific for the amino terminus of csp (N-end antibody) was obtained by covalently conjugating recombinant Xenopus csp 1–112 to Pierce's aminolink resin (following the manufacturer's instructions) and adsorbing csp antiserum (16Poage R.L. Meriney S.L. Gundersen C.B. Umbach J.A. J. Neurophysiol. 1999; 82: 50-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) to this matrix, washing with phosphate-buffered saline, and eluting the bound antibody using 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 3.0). After adjusting the pH to 7.5 with 1 m Tris base, the antibody capable of binding the carboxyl terminus of csp was removed by passing the N-end antibody through an aminolink resin to which the recombinant carboxyl end of Xenopus csp (residues 137–197) was coupled. This protocol yields an antibody that selectively identifies the amino terminus of csp but not the carboxyl terminus of csp. Quantification (by densitometry) of immunoblot signals used one-dimensional image analysis software from Kodak. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D., and significant results were assessed by Student's t test. In many experiments, overexpression of csp constructs was sufficiently robust that the signal for csp in control oocytes was only detected when the signal for the overexpressed csp constructs exhibited saturation. Although our routine quantification of the extent of overexpression of csp constructs is likely to be underestimated, independent analyses of diluted extracts from csp overexpressing oocytes set this error at <30%. Subcellular Fractionation of Oocytes—As described (7Kohan S.A. Gundersen C.B. J. Exp. Zool. 2003; 300: 113-125Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), oocytes were gently disrupted and centrifuged (3 min at 720 × g) to yield a pellet enriched in cortical granules, plasma membrane, yolk, and pigment granules, whereas most other subcellular constituents (including β-tubulin, which was detected by immunoblot using monoclonal antibody E7 from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) remain in the low speed supernatant (7Kohan S.A. Gundersen C.B. J. Exp. Zool. 2003; 300: 113-125Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 26Gundersen C.B. Aguado F. Sou S. Mastrogiacomo A. Coppola T. Kornblum H.I. Umbach J.A.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surface labeling of oocytes prior to this fractionation protocol used water-soluble, polyethylene oxide-maleimide biotin (0.1 mm in Barths solution; Pierce) for 15 min to alkylate thiol residues that had been reduced by dithiothreitol (2 mm). Detection used streptavidin-peroxidase (Sigma) and enhanced chemiluminescence. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy—Isolated cortical regions of oocytes were prepared (as in Ref. 26Gundersen C.B. Aguado F. Sou S. Mastrogiacomo A. Coppola T. Kornblum H.I. Umbach J.A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 303: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) from control oocytes or oocytes expressing either GFP-csp or GFP-syntaxin 1a (from rat; kindly provided by Dr. T. Coppola, University of Nice, France) and fixed for 10 min in 3% paraformaldehyde in Barths solution prior to mounting (using Fluoromount) on glass slides. Specimens were examined using a Zeiss 510 Meta laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with an argon laser and a 40× 1.3 na Plan-Neofluar objective (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc., Thornwood, N.Y.) with 488 nm excitation and a band pass filter setting of 505–530 nm. Image stacks (5 μm) were collected in 0.1–1.0-μm z-steps and projected onto a single plane or used to obtain a z-plane image. Images were collected at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels (GFP-csp) or 2048 × 2048 pixels (GFP-syntaxin 1a). Immunoprecipitation—Oocytes were disrupted in extraction buffer (1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline with 2 mm ADP) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 1 min. The supernatant was precleared for 15 min with 0.1 volume of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz). Cleared extract from 2–3 oocytes was incubated with or without affinity-purified csp antibody (1–2 μg), and as a separate control, csp antibody was added to extraction buffer alone. After 1 h at 4 °C, protein A/G-agarose (10 μl) was added, and samples were gently mixed by rotation. After 30–40 min, the agarose beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with extraction buffer before dispersion in sample buffer. Recovered protein was resolved electrophoretically for immunoblot analysis using Hsp/Hsc 70 antibody or csp antibody, as above. Blots were also probed for two abundant oocyte proteins, actin and β-tubulin. Assay of Constitutive Exocytosis—Plasma membrane proteins are efficiently delivered to the surface of the oocyte via a constitutive exocytotic pathway involving carrier vesicles that are ∼100 nm in diameter (30Zampighi G.A. Loo D.D.F. Kreman M. Eskandari S. Wright E.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 507-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We developed a biochemical assay of this process by expressing GFP-syntaxin 1a in oocytes and monitoring the appearance of GFP-syntaxin 1a immunoreactivity in the low speed pellet fraction of oocytes (generated as in Ref. 7Kohan S.A. Gundersen C.B. J. Exp. Zool. 2003; 300: 113-125Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar; results from confocal fluorescence microscopy confirm that GFP-syntaxin 1a reaches the plasma membrane of oocytes). To verify that the presence of GFP-syntaxin 1a in the low speed pellet requires intact protein trafficking via the Golgi apparatus, some oocytes were treated with the Golgi-dismantling reagent, brefeldin A (50 μm) subsequent to the injection of RNA for GFP-syntaxin 1a. To assess the impact of csp constructs on the trafficking of GFP-syntaxin, oocytes were injected with csp RNA 2 days prior to injection with GFP-syntaxin 1a RNA. Functional Consequence of csp Overexpression—Xenopus oocytes typically secrete 1–1.5 μg of cortical granule lectin in response to PMA (2Bement W.M. Capco D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 7Kohan S.A. Gundersen C.B. J. Exp. Zool. 2003; 300: 113-125Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 26Gundersen C.B. Aguado F. Sou S. Mastrogiacomo A. Coppola T. Kornblum H.I. Umbach J.A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 303: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This is illustrated in Fig. 1A, which shows the broad band of highly glycosylated lectin that is collected from three individual control oocytes exposed to 50 nm PMA. In contrast, secretion of this lectin is greatly diminished (or absent) for cells that overexpress full-length csp (Fig. 1A). Quantification of this inhibitory effect reveals that the mean amount of secreted cortical granule lectin drops to 20 ± 13% of control (for 29 control cells and 26 cells overexpressing csp) in oocytes challenged with PMA 3–4 days after injection of csp RNA (this difference is significant at p < 0.01). Immunoblot analysis revealed that oocytes injected 3–4 days earlier with 30–50 ng of Xcsp RNA expressed 20 ± 15 times more csp than control oocytes (Fig. 1B). The overexpressed csp was present as two distinct species in the RNA-injected oocytes. In addition to csp immunoreactivity at the same mobility of csp in control oocytes (32–33 kDa, see Fig. 1B), there was an additional band at ∼27 kDa (Fig. 1B). Because this latter species exhibited mobility that is consistent with the mass of csp prior to fatty acylation (or after deacylation; see Refs. 18Gundersen C.B. Mastrogiacomo A. Faull K. Umbach J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19197-19199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Gundersen C.B. Kohan S.A. Chen Q. Iagnemma J. Umbach J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and 32Mastrogiacomo A. Kornblum H.I. Umbach J.A. Gundersen C.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 239-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), it is very likely that this form of overexpressed csp lacks lipid modification (indeed, when extracts of csp overexpressing oocytes were treated with the deacylating reagent, hydroxylamine (1 m (pH 7.0), followed by reduction and alkylation) all of the 32–33 kDa csp was converted to the 27-kDa species, data not shown). Together with the data of Fig. 1A these results indicate that csp is overexpressed in oocytes, and this overexpression interferes with the normal pathway by which PMA elicits the secretion of cortical granule lectin. It is also important to note that with less robust overexpression (<10-fold) of csp there is proportionately less inhibition of cortical granule exocytosis (data not shown). The results of Fig. 1A could be explained by an effect of overexpressed csp that either impairs the exocytotic pathway or that alters the pool of cortical granule lectin available for secretion (for instance, by promoting degradation of cortical granules or by prematurely evoking secretion). We excluded an effect of overexpressed csp on the available pool of cortical granules via three separate avenues. First, individual oocytes were transferred to 12 μl of Barths solution 2 h after injection of csp RNA and after 2 days the fluid was collected and assayed for secreted cortical granule lectin. No lectin was detected (data not shown), indicating that csp overexpression does not, by itself, trigger secretion from cortical granules (in contrast, overexpression of protein kinase C η does trigger cortical granule exocytosis; see Ref. 31Gundersen C.B. Kohan S.A. Chen Q. Iagnemma J. Umbach J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, we exposed oocytes (control or csp overexpressing) to PMA (50 nm for 30 min) and verified that secretion was significantly diminished in oocytes overexpressing csp (Fig. 1C). Then, the same oocytes were incubated in a solution containing 10 μm ionomycin plus 20 mm added Ca2+ (this procedure promotes secretion via an apparently protein-independent effect on oocyte membranes; see “Materials and Methods”). This second incubation culminated in the discharge of very little cortical granule lectin from the control oocytes, because these cells had discharged most of the available lectin in response to PMA (Fig. 1C). However, the csp overexpressing oocytes released essentially as much cortical granule lectin during the high Ca-ionomycin incubation as control oocytes had released in response to PMA (Fig. 1C). These data indicate that csp overexpressing oocytes retain cortical granule lectin in a pool that is accessible to the nonspecific secretory effect of high Ca2+ plus ionomycin. For a final control, we evaluated oocyte extracts for cortical granule lectin immunoreactivity after 30 min in 50 nm PMA. Under these conditions, control oocytes typically secrete ∼80% of their cortical granule lectin (data not shown; see Ref. 31Gundersen C.B. Kohan S.A. Chen Q. Iagnemma J. Umbach J.A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1313-1320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, csp overexpressing oocytes retained a level of cortical granule lectin immunoreactivity that was indistinguishable from cells that had not been treated with PMA (data not shown; however, images in Fig. 3B reveal that cortical granules are present in oocytes expressing high levels of GFP-csp). Taken together, these experiments indicate that cortical granules persist in oocytes that overexpress csp, but there is a block of the pathway by which PMA elicits cortical granule exocytosis. Distribution of Overexpressed csp in Oocytes—To assess further the basis of the secretory inhibition in oocytes overexpressing csp, we evaluated the subcellular distribution of the newly produced csp using biochemical and cell biological approaches. As reported previously (26Gundersen C.B. Aguado F. Sou S. Mastrogiacomo A. Coppola T. Kornblum H.I. Umbach J.A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 303: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), when control oocytes are gently disrupted and subjected to low speed centrifugation, 80–90% of the endogenous csp immunoreactivity (and >90% of the cortical granule lectin immunoreactivity; Ref. 26Gundersen C.B.

(The utility of this fractionation procedure for discriminating oocyte compartments is further evidenced by the fact that β-tubulin immunoreactivity is detected only in the low speed supernatant of control and csp overexpressing oocytes (Fig. 2). Conversely, when oocytes that had been incubated with a membrane-impermeant alkylating agent are fractionated via this protocol, the labeled proteins, exemplified by the 35-kDa species in Fig. 2, are detected only in the pellet). However, fractionation of oocytes that overexpress csp yielded a pattern that was qualitatively and quantitatively different from control oocytes. In addition to there being abundant csp in the low speed supernatant (overall, csp in the low speed supernatant of csp overexpressing cells was >20-fold higher than csp in the supernatant of control oocytes), the 27-kDa form of csp (that lacks lipid modification) was distributed approximately equally between the low speed supernatant and pellet (Fig. 2). Although these data indicate that csp is differentially distributed in oocytes that overexpress this protein, the results do not distinguish where in the cell csp is localized. Because csp is predominantly associated with cortical granules in control oocytes (26Gundersen C.B. Aguado F. Sou S. Mastrogiacomo A. Coppola T. Kornblum H.I. Umbach J.A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 303: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), a functionally important issue is whether any of the overexpressed csp is targeted to these granules. To evaluate whether overexpressed csp associates with c"

PC12 cells were shown to express a single class of high affinity binding sites for Mig (670 receptors/cell, Kd = 2.9 nm). Mig induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Comparison of extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathways between Mig and nerve growth factor (NGF) revealed that these pathways are crucial for Mig action as well as NGF. K252a, an inhibitor of tyrosine autophosphorylation of tyrosine kinase receptors (Trks) did not inhibit the action of Mig, suggesting that Mig action occurs via a different receptor from that of NGF. Furthermore, Mig as well as NGF promoted PC12 survival under serum-free conditions and activated Akt/protein kinase B downstream from phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Because the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 prevented the Mig- and NGF-induced survival effect, this effect is probably mediated by the PI3K signaling pathway. Mig also promoted survival of rat primary sympathetic neurons that die when deprived of NGF. These results suggest that chemokines, including Mig (CXCL9) have neurotrophic effects on the nervous system.

These results suggest that chemokines, including Mig (CXCL9) have neurotrophic effects on the nervous system. Chemokines are small secreted proteins (8-10 kDa) that were initially recognized as playing roles in leukocyte communication and migration in both physiological and pathological contexts in the immune system (1Luster A.D.

Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). They are classified into four classes based on the positions of key N-terminal cysteine residues: C, CC, CXC, and CX3C (1Luster A.D. N. Engl. J.

The two major families are the CXC and CC chemokines, which interact with seven-transmembrane G-protein-linked CXCR and CCR receptors, respectively (1Luster A.D. N. Engl. J.

Besides their well established roles in the immune system, several recent reports have demonstrated that these proteins also have roles in the CNS. The best known major action is their ability to act as immunoinflammatory mediators. These proteins regulate leukocyte infiltration in the brain during neuroinflammatory conditions and diseases, which range from bacterial and viral meningoencephalitis (4Lahrtz F. J.

Aside from their function as immunoinflammatory mediators, recent studies have led to the realization that some members of the chemokine family and their cognate receptors have an important role in cellular communication in developing and normal adult CNS. As support for this concept, chemokines and their receptors have been observed in both developing and adult brains by in situ studies (13Horuk R. Marlin A.W. Wang Z. Schweitzer L. Gerassimides A.

In addition, studies with knock-out mice have shown that the stromal-cell-derived factor 1/SDF-1/CXCL12, which is synthesized constitutively in the developing brain, plays an essential role in neuron migration during formation of the granule-cell layer of the cerebellum (18Ma Q.

The chemokines are a large and ever-expanding family of proteins with more than 50 members. However, these known chemokine functions in the CNS represent only the tip of the iceberg.Nerve growth factor (NGF), 2The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; Trk, tyrosine kinase receptor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MTT, (3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl)tetrazolium bromide; PI, propidium iodide; RT, reverse transcription; IP-10, interferon-inducible protein 10; 1-TAC, interferon-inducible T cell-α chemoattractant; GAP-43, growth-associated protein 43; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; Trk, tyrosine kinase receptors.2The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; Trk, tyrosine kinase receptor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MTT, (3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl)tetrazolium bromide; PI, propidium iodide; RT, reverse transcription; IP-10, interferon-inducible protein 10; 1-TAC, interferon-inducible T cell-α chemoattractant; GAP-43, growth-associated protein 43; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; Trk, tyrosine kinase receptors. a prominent neurotrophic factor, plays a crucial role in promoting growth, differentiation, and survival of sympathetic nerve cells (20Oestreicher A.B.

The PC12 cell line was derived from a pheochromocytoma tumor of the rat adrenal medulla (21Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4825) Google Scholar), and it has been used as a model system for neuronal differentiation and death. PC12 cells respond to NGF by extension of neurites and the acquisition of sympathetic neuronal phenotype (21Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4825) Google Scholar). PC12 cells undergo apoptosis when cultured in serum-free medium without NGF. However, supplementation of serum-free medium with NGF promotes the survival of PC12 cells (22Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). To obtain novel neurotrophic factors like NGF, we investigated the effect of over 200 small secreted proteins, such as cytokines, chemokines, and bioactive peptides on PC12 cells. As a result, we found that one of the CXC chemokines, monokine induced by interferon-γ (Mig, CXCL9) promotes the neuronal differentiation and survival of PC12 cells. Mig also promoted the survival of rat primary sympathetic neurons that die when deprived of NGF.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—PC12 cell line was purchased from ATCC. Antibodies for phospho-ERK1/2, ERK1/2, phospho-Akt, and Akt were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Amersham Biosciences; all human chemokines (Mig, IP-10, and I-TAC), PD98059, LY294002, K252a, pertussis toxin, anti-GAP-43 antibody were from Sigma; anti-human Mig antibody was from Chemicon; and mouse NGF (2.5S) was from Promega.Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm vanadate, 1% Nonidet P-40, EDTA-free Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). Protein extracts transferred to nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies. Signals were detected by the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences) using Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) for exposure.Determination of Neurite Outgrowth—PC12 cells were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 5% heat-inactivated horse serum (Invitrogen). To measure neurite outgrowth, 2 × 104 cells were seeded in each well of a 24-well plate that had been coated with mouse collagen type IV (BD Biosciences) in DMEM containing 1% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 0.5% heat-inactivated horse serum with or without ligand (Mig, NGF) as indicated. After incubation for 24 h, for quantification of neurite outgrowth, random photographs were taken (three or four per well) and process-bearing neurites were counted, scoring as possible processes those of length greater than the cell's diameter. Three independent experiments were performed in duplicate for each data point presented. Neurites were identified and counted from ∼100 cells per photograph.To investigate the effect of a neutralizing Mig antibody on Mig-induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells, Mig-containing medium (100 ng/ml) was preincubated with the antibody (1 μg/ml) for 60 min at 4 °C, and the resulting medium was used for PC12 neurite extension assay as described above.Confocal Microscopy—PC12 cells were seeded on poly-d-lysine/mouse laminin-coated culture slides and were incubated with or without Mig or NGF. After 24 h, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, permeabilized with 100% methanol for 30 min, and blocked with 5% donkey serum/PBS for 30 min. After incubation with primary antibody (anti-GAP43 mAb, Sigma) for 1 h, the cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated with Alexa488-labeled secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) for 1 h. Propidium iodide (Molecular Probes) was used to visualize the nucleus. Fluorescent images were obtained by FV300 laser scanning confocal microscopy (Olympus).Ras and Rap1 Activation Assay—Ras and Rap1 GTP loading were measured using Ras and Rap1 activation assay kits (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after stimulation, cells were rinsed rapidly in ice-cold PBS and solubilized at 4 °C for 10 min in lysis buffer. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads coupled to C-RafRBD/GST to isolate RasGTP or RalGDSRBD/GST to isolate Rap1GTP. Protein complexes were allowed to form for 1 h at 4°C. Precipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer. Finally, precipitates were resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and denatured proteins were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis with an anti-Ras or anti-Rap1 antibody.Cell Survival Assay—Cells were seeded on mouse collagen type IV coated 96-well plates at 5 ×103 cells/well. At 24 h after plating, the cells were washed three times with PBS and grown in serum-free DMEM treated with or without NGF or Mig at the indicated concentration. In experiments including LY294002, the PI3K inhibitor was added at 20 μm to the serum-free media for 15 min, and 100 ng/ml NGF or 200 ng/ml Mig was added. Cell survival was determined using the (3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl)tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay-based Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo), and relative cell numbers were determined in triplicate by estimating the value of day 0 as 100.Detection of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry analysis of the cell cycle after DNA staining with propidium iodide (PI). Cells were grown in 6-well plates that had been coated with mouse collagen type IV until they reached ∼50% confluence. The medium was then replaced with complete or serum-free medium in the presence or absence of indicated ligand (Mig, NGF). After 48-h incubation, the cells attached to the plates and floating (detached) dead cells were harvested in PBS/EDTA (5 mm EDTA in PBS). The cells were then centrifuged, and the cell pellet was suspended in 0.5 ml of PBS. The cell suspension was transferred to 4.5 ml of 70% cold ethanol and kept at -20 °C for a minimum of 2 h. Ethanol-fixed cells were centrifuged and washed once with 10 ml of PBS. Finally, the cell pellet was suspended in 1 ml of staining solution (20 μg/ml PI, 0.2 mg/ml RNase in PBS) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were analyzed by flow cytometry (Epics XL, Beckman Coulter), including a first selection (gate 1) in which events of the appropriate size (forward scatter) and complexity (side scatter) were selected. The selected events were then analyzed to discard doublets using a PI intensity-width versus PI intensity-area dot plot (gate 2). Finally, events (cells) present in gates 1 and 2 were plotted as a histogram representing the number of events (cells) containing a specific PI intensity-area (specific amount of DNA). Apoptosis was measured as the percentage of cells with a sub-G0/G1 DNA content in the PI intensity-area histogram plot.Sympathetic Neuronal Cultures and Neuronal Death Survival Assay—Primary cultures of sympathetic neurons from superior cervical ganglion were prepared by dissecting tissue from embryonic day 21 or postnatal day 0 rats. The ganglia were placed in DMEM, digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase(Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by digestion with trypsin (Invitrogen) for another 30 min. Ganglia were then dissociated into a suspension of individual cells. The cell suspension was plated on poly-d-lysine/mouse laminin-coated culture slides (BD Biosciences). Cultures were then incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2 atmosphere in medium composed of minimal essential medium (Invitrogen), containing 2 nm NGF, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 20 μm fluorodeoxyuridine, and 10 μm aphidicolin. After 6 days, the neuronal cultures were deprived of NGF by switching to a medium lacking NGF and containing an anti-NGF antibody (Roche Applied Science). After 12 h, this medium was replaced with medium in the presence or absence of indicated ligand (Mig, NGF). Neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS overnight at 4 °C and rinsed in PBS and stained briefly with 0.1% crystal violet. The neurons were destained in H2O, dehydrated in increasing ethanol concentrations, and then transferred to xylene. Neurons staining darker than debris with a clearly defined cellular outline and a well defined nucleus were scored as viable. Random photographs were taken (three or four per well), and the average number of viable cells per field was determined. Three independent experiments were performed in duplicate for each data point presented.RNA Isolation and Northern Blot Analysis—Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from PC12 cells. Rat spleen, fetal brain (Sprague-Dawley, postnatal day 0), and adult brain (Sprague-Dawley, 8 weeks old) mRNAs were purchased from Clontech. Poly(A)+ RNA, 5 μg, was fractionated on 1% agarose gel containing 2.2 m formaldehyde and then transferred to a Hybond N+ filter membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C in ExpressHyb solution (Clontech). The probe for rat CXCR3 was prepared by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using rat spleen mRNA and a primer set of 5′-GAGCAGCACAGACACCTTCCTGCTCCACCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGATATGGGCATAGCAGTAGGCCATGACTA-3′ (antisense). The probe for human Mig was prepared by RT-PCR using human spleen mRNA and a primer set of 5′-CCACATCCCACTCACAACAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCTGAGCAAACATCCTGTC-3′ (antisense). The probe for rat Mig was prepared by RT-PCR using rat spleen mRNA and a primer set of 5′-TTTCCTAAATAAATATGACC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGAGTTGTGTATTAAAGGGA-3′ (antisense). The β-actin probe was purchased from Clontech. The DNA fragments were labeled with 32P using the Multi-prime DNA labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). After washing at 60 °C with 0.2 × standard saline citrate (SSC) and 0.1% SDS, the filter was exposed to an x-ray film (Kodak) at -80 °C with an intensifying screen.Binding Assay—The purified recombinant Mig was radiolabeled using 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For displacement experiments, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 125I-labeled Mig in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled chemokines in 200 μl of binding buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2). For saturation experiments, cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of radiolabeled Mig in the presence or absence of 1 μm unlabeled Mig. At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed five times with binding buffer and then lysed in 0.5 ml of 1 n NaOH. Radioactivity was determined using a gamma counter. Each data point was determined in duplicate, and binding data were analyzed according to the method of Scatchard.RESULTSMig Increases Neurite Extension in PC12 Cells—We examined the effect of over 200 small secreted proteins such as cytokines, chemokines, and bioactive peptides on neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Our results indicated that one of the CXC chemokines, monokine induced by interferon-γ (Mig, CXCL9) stimulates neurite extension in PC12 cells. Mig treatment of PC12 cells induced their differentiation, as shown clearly by the appearance of neurite outgrowth within 24 h (Fig. 1A). In contrast, interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10), interferon-inducible T cell-α chemoattractant (I-TAC) that belongs to the CXC chemokine (non-ELR motif) subfamily did not stimulate neurite extension in PC12 cells (Fig. 1A). We next attempted to block Mig-induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells using a neutralizing Mig antibody. When the medium containing Mig was preincubated with a neutralizing Mig antibody, the neurite outgrowth activity of Mig was dramatically reduced (Fig. 1A). In contrast, preincubation of NGF with this antibody had no effect on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (data not shown).Mig promoted the extension in PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner according to quantitative analysis of neurite extension (Fig. 1B). Substantial neurite outgrowth was observed at 50 ng/ml Mig or higher concentrations. With 100 ng/ml Mig, neurite outgrowth was the maximum and about the same level as that by 100 ng/ml NGF. After 2 days of treatment, the cultures treated with Mig and NGF still appeared comparable. The rate of neurite extension was the same for NGF for the first 48 h but after that, neurite length in the presence of Mig remained relatively constant while that caused by NGF increased. The amino acid sequence of rat Mig shares 65% sequence identity (or 77% similarity) to its human ortholog. Like human Mig, rat Mig also strongly stimulated neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. S1).The growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43) is frequently used as a marker for sprouting, because it is located in growth cones, maximally expressed during nervous system development, and re-induced in injured and regenerating neural tissues (23Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4222) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry showed that GAP-43 immunoreactivity was much stronger in Mig-differentiated PC12 cells and NGF-differentiated PC12 cells than in untreated PC12 cells (Fig. 2A) in accordance with the result of Western blotting analysis of GAP-43 (Fig. 2B). GAP-43 protein in Mig-differentiated PC12 cells was intensely distributed in the neuritic processes as in NGF-differentiated PC12 cells (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Mig augments the amount of GAP-43 protein in PC12 cells. A, distribution of GAP-43 in PC12 cells. PC12 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml Mig or 100 ng/ml NGF for 24 h. After 24 h, Mig, NGF-treated and untreated cells were fixed, and then immunostained with a monoclonal antibody for the GAP-43 (green). Nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (red). GAP-43 was detected by confocal microscopy. The experiment shown was repeated three more times, with similar results. B, immunoblot analysis of GAP-43. PC12 cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well in DMEM and treated with DMEM containing various ligand (100 ng/ml, respectively). After 24 h, lysates were prepared and subjected directly to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-GAP-43 antibody. The experiment shown was repeated three more times, with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Neurite Outgrowth Action of Mig Is Mediated by ERK Signal Transduction—NGF-induced sustained activation of ERK pathway has been suggested to be crucial to the neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (24Kao S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Kolch W. Landreth G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18169-18177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). This led us to investigate whether Mig induces neurite outgrowth via sustained activation of the ERK pathway. ERK kinase inhibitor PD98059 markedly inhibited neurite outgrowth activity of NGF in a dose-dependent manner, supporting previous findings (Fig. 3A). Mig-induced neurite outgrowth was also inhibited by PD98059 in a similar dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A), suggesting that activation of the ERK pathway is critical to the neurite outgrowth activity of Mig. We then used immunoblot analysis with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody to detect activated ERK in PC12 cells stimulated by NGF or Mig. NGF stimulated activation of ERK in PC12 cells, and Mig also stimulated it (Fig. 3B). This induction of ERK activation in PC12 cells appeared within 5 min by Mig as well as NGF. ERK activation by Mig, however, lasted for 2 h at least, which was much longer than that by NGF (Fig. 3B). These findings suggest that sustained activation of ERK is critical for Mig-induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells as well as NGF. IP-10 and I-TAC did not activate ERK1/2 (supplemental Fig. S2). We confirmed that PD98059 was able to inhibit ERK activation by Mig (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Activation of Ras, Rap1, and ERK by Mig. A, effect of PD98059 on neurite outgrowth induced by Mig. PC12 cells were plated and preincubated in DMEM containing the indicated concentration of PD98059 for 15 min, and then 100 ng/ml Mig or 100 ng/ml NGF was added. After further incubation for 24 h, the percentage of cells with neurites was determined. Each value is the mean ± S.E. for about 100 cells sampled from three independent experiments. B, time course of ERK phosphorylation in PC12 cells stimulated by Mig or NGF. PC12 cells (2 × 104 cells) were treated with DMEM containing 100 ng/ml Mig or 100 ng/ml NGF. At the indicated times, the cells were lysed and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis with an anti-phospho-ERK antibody (p-ERK). The blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-ERK antibody (ERK) to verify that the protein levels were uniform. The experiments were repeated three times with similar results. C, effect of PD98059 on ERK phosphorylation in PC12 stimulated by Mig. PC12 cells were plated and preincubated in DMEM containing the indicated concentration of PD98059 for 15 min, and 100 ng/ml Mig was added, followed by further incubation for 5 min. ERK phosphorylation was analyzed by immunoblotting. Data shown are representative of three experiments. D, kinetic analysis of Ras and Rap1 activation. Equal numbers of serum-starved PC12 cells were treated with either Mig (100 ng/ml) or NGF (100 ng/ml). At different time points, cells were lysed and analyzed with in vitro Ras and Rap1 activation assays employing C-RafRBD/GST and RalGDSRBD/GST. Data shown are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It has been suggested that activation of ERK by NGF involves two distinct pathways: the initial activation of ERK requires the small G protein Ras, but its activation is sustained by the small G protein Rap1 (24Kao S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Kolch W. Landreth G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18169-18177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Thus we investigated whether Mig activates Ras and Rap1 in PC12 cells. First, we examined Ras activation via an established method that takes advantage of specific binding of a C-RafRBD/GST fusion protein to the activated, GTP-bound, form of Ras. When serum-starved PC12 cells were treated with Mig, Ras activation was induced transiently in a pattern similar to that for NGF (Fig. 3D). Ras was activated maximally at 2-5 min and was down-regulated rapidly thereafter (Fig. 3D). We next investigated the effect of Mig on Rap1 activation. Similar to the assay used for activated Ras, a RalGDSRBD/GST fusion protein was used to analyze Rap1 activation. Like other small GTP-binding proteins, Rap1 is active in the GTP-bound state. Mig treatment elicited a marked increase in Rap1GTP (Fig. 3D). Like NGF, Mig-induced Rap1 activation was detected as early as 2 min and sustained for 60 min at least, an effect that matched the sustained activation of ERK pathway. These results suggest that Ras and Rap1 are involved in ERK activation by Mig.Induction of Cell Survival by Mig through PI3K Pathway—PC12 cells are not viable in medium lacking serum. However, supplementation of serum-free medium with NGF promotes the survival of PC12 cells (25Yao R. Cooper G.M.

To test the possibility of Mig also promoting the survival of PC12 cells, the cells were cultured in serum-free medium with or without Mig for up to 3 days. The relative number of surviving cells was determined at different time points after serum deprivation. In contrast to the exponential decrease in the number of PC12 cells in serum-free medium, the number of Mig-treated PC12 cells was maintained or even increased in serum-free medium for up to 3 days (Fig."
