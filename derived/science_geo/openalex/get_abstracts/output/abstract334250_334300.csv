No change in membrane disgestibility occurs at fertilization. In tests thus far of two-cell eggs and later stages, development continues. Blastocysts exhibit ""hatching"" behavior despite absence of the zona. Functions of the zona include maintenance of the normal cleavage pattern and prevention of egg fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2031297136,"The optical and electronic properties of thin films of the solution-processible polymer poly-(CH(3))(3)Si-cyclooctatetraene are presented. This conjugated polymer is based on a polyacetylene backbone with (CH(3))(3)Si side groups. Thin transparent films have been cast onto n-doped silicon (n-Si) substrates and doped with iodine to form surfacebarrier solar cells. The devices produce photovoltages that are at the theoretical limit and that are much greater than can be obtained from n-Si contacts with conventional metals. Two methods for forming layered polymeric materials, one involving the spincoating of preformed polymers and the other comprising the sequential polymerization of different monomers, are also described. An organic polymer analog of a metal/insulator/metal capacitor has been constructed with the latter method."
https://openalex.org/W2037275759,"A bond valence sum (BVS) analysis was performed for the p-type cuprate superconductors. The superconducting critical temperature T(c) versus in-plane Cu-O BVS correlation for copper is grouped into classes and subclasses. Only within a class or subclass for which the nonelectronic effect is constant does the variation of the in-plane Cu-O BVS reflect the corresponding change in the hole density n(H) of the CuO(2) layers. This study strongly suggests that the T(c) for every class or subclass of the superconductors is an inverted parabolic function of n(H), and so is the coupling constant lambda for Cooper pair formation."
https://openalex.org/W2014674172,"Emulsification makes it possible to supercool water to the homogeneous nucleation temperature. Accordingly, the heat capacities of water and deuterium oxide have been determined from the respective equilibrium melting points to -38 degrees and to -34 degrees C, respectively. Two methods, drift calorimetry and differential scanning calorimetry, have been used. Both methods reveal a striking rise in the constant-pressure heat capacity below -20 degrees C. This indication of an apparently cooperative behavior should serve to test current theories of water, most notably perhaps, the pair potential model of Ben-Naim and Stillinger. Some implications of possible meteorological significance are mentioned."
https://openalex.org/W2055698174,"The mechanisms that appear to account for the effects of ionizing radiation on the growth of plants are reviewed. Preliminary results are reported from a systematic study of the effects of gamma radiation on a terrestrial ecosystem and its components. The ecosystem chosen for this experiment supports a stana of the Long Island pine-oak forest. A 9500 c Cs/sup 137/ source, designed so it can be shielded when desired. was centrally located. Rates of exposure vary from several thousand r/day within a few Meters to about 2 r/day at 130 meters. The source has been exposed 20 hr/day since Nov. 22, 1961 Prior to installation of the source, a detailed survey was made on the species composition of the vegetation and on the size and vigor of individual plants. The early effects of radiation exposure are described. (C.H.)"
https://openalex.org/W2011799546,"Enhanced abundances of neutral potassium (K) in the atmosphere of Mercury have been found above the longitude range containing Caloris Basin. Results of a large data set including six elongations of the planet between June 1986 and January 1988 show typical K column abundances of approximately 5.4 x 10(8) K atoms/cm(2). During the observing period in October 1987, when Caloris Basin was in view, the typical K column was approximately 2.7 x 10(9) K atoms/cm(2). Another large value (2.1 x 10(9) K atoms/cm(2)) was seen over the Caloris antipode in January 1988. This enhancement is consistent with an increased source of K from the well-fractured crust and regolith associated with this large impact basin. The phenomenon is localized because at most solar angles, thermal alkali atoms cannot move more than a few hundred kilometers from their source before being lost to ionization by solar ultraviolet radiation."

https://openalex.org/W2093824024,"The fusion of lipid membranes at the air-water interface has been detected with the use of x-ray reflection as a high-resolution, surface-sensitive technique. The rate of this fusion for dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) bilayers is the highest at 29 degrees C, which coincides with the chain-melting phase-transition temperature for the top membrane layers. After 6 hours of incubation a stack of at least ten surface-ordered membrane bilayers in equilibrium with the bulk vesicle suspension is formed. Such fusion is thus surface-catalyzed but not restricted to the first surface layer. The process involves partial membrane dehydration near the solution surface which decreases toward the bulk."
https://openalex.org/W2010358681,"In 139 families having a child born with anencephalus or spina bifida, 10 of 308 siblings of the affected children had malformations similar to those of the affected children. The incidence of these malformations in siblings of affected children is significantly greater than the incidence in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W2014789916,"The maximum depth at which large (>1000 km3) terrestrial mafic magma chambers can form has generally been thought to be the Moho, which occurs at a mean depth of about 35 kilometers beneath the continents and 8 kilometers beneath ocean basins. However, the presence of layers of cumulus magnesium-rich spinel and olivine and intercumulus garnet in an unusual mantle xenolith from Oahu, Hawaii, suggests that this rock is a fragment of a large magma chamber that formed at a depth of about 90 kilometers; Hawaiian shield-building magmas may pond and fractionate in such magma chambers before continuing their ascent. This depth is at or near the base of the 90-million-year-old lithosphere beneath Oahu; thus, rejuvenated stage alkalic magmas containing mantle xenoliths evidently also originate below the lithosphere."

https://openalex.org/W1987966751,"A chemically distinct group of lunar rocks with the trace element characteristics of basaltic lunar rocks is apparently ubiquitous on the lunar surface. Such rocks have been found at the Apollo 15, Apollo 16, and Luna 20 landing sites. They may be derived from the plains-forming material that has been designated Cayley Formation."
https://openalex.org/W2093242166,"A specimen of Lesleya, previously known only as isolated sterile foliage, has been found with two rows of ovule-bearing receptacles on opposite sides of the petiole. This specimen is from the Lower Pennsylvanian (Namurian B or C) of western Illinois. The fertile portion of this specimen is similar to Phasmatocycas kansana Mamay from the Lower Permian of Kansas and Texas, which Mamay interpreted as an ancestral form to cycads. Phasmatocycas was found attached to the base of Taeniopteris by Gillespie and Pfefferkorn. The foliar portions, Lesleya and Taeniopteris, have many features in common; the major morphologic difference is curvature of the veins. Lesleya and its attached fertile petiole are proposed as ancestors of Taeniopteris and Phasmatocycas, and ultimately, the ancestors of modern cycads. This extends the age of known precursors of cycads back from the Early Permian to Early Pennsylvanian (about 320 million years ago), approximately 35 million years earlier."
https://openalex.org/W1977836875,"Contract negotiations over wages are sometimes accompanied by strikes; similarly in legal contexts, settlements of damage claims may require lengthy negotiations. These and other costly delays in resolving disputes are the subject of the studies described in this article. Formulations in terms of game theory indicate that procedural features can allow delays, but the main cause may be informational disparities between the parties. Several models are described and related to data about strikes."
https://openalex.org/W2043259001,"Two color-separation positive transparencies of a scene, one projected with ""red"" light and the other with tungsten lamp light, were superimposed on a screen. The light was polarized so that an observer wearing an appropriate viewer could either see both images in each eye or the ""red"" image in one eye and the ""white"" image in the other. These two situations gave different results, not the same results, as some previous investigators have claimed. Land's major results cannot be ""obtained stereoscopically."" We conclude that the process by which color is formed could possibly be a process of the retina or the lateral geniculate body, and does not necessarily have to be a process of the cerebral cortex as implied by the binocular experiments which purported to give the fuller gamut of color."

This method is useful for checking a compound's molecular formula against its structural formula or systematic name. While it applies to all chemical compounds, it is of most value for compounds with complex ring structures."

https://openalex.org/W4234489583,"The modern revolt against science has been spurred by a misunderstanding of the nature of science, argues J. A. Passmore, professor of philosophy at the Australian National University, Canberra. Passmore believes that some of the misunderstanding rests with critics of science such as Theodore Roszak (see Science, 1 December 1972) and somne with the way that scientists have presented their affairs to the public. In the excerpts below (taken from the December issue of Search, the journal of the Australian Association for the Advancement of Science), Passmore analyzes the revolt against science as one that ""condemns science for making itself the instrument of power, looks with dismay on the devastation to which science-based technology has given rise, rejects a world made gray by standardization . . . [and] seeks to reinstate the imagination and direct sensual enjoyment."""
