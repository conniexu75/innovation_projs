https://openalex.org/W1965643550,"Diadromous migration, in which some fish species migrate from freshwater and feed in the ocean (anadromous species) and others migrate from the ocean and feed in freshwater (catadromous), has long been perplexing. However, when the distribution of diadromous species is examined with respect to global patterns in aquatic productivity, this apparent paradox is resolved. The contrasting directions of migration can largely be explained by the relative availability of food resources in ocean and freshwater habitats. Oceans are more productive than freshwaters in temperate latitudes, and anadromous species predominate. In contrast, catadromous species generally occur in tropical latitudes where freshwater productivity exceeds that of the ocean."

This newly discovered cesium ion sieve is useful in the decontamination as well as immobilization of cesium at room temperature through chemical bonding and may find applications in nuclear waste disposal and in decontamination of the environment after accidental releases of nuclear materials."

 late 1920s. In this note, McClintock and Beadle related their finding that the non-viable pollen trait was inherited as a
 single gene."
https://openalex.org/W1970704742,"Rotating waves of activity are seen in various biological phenomena and in chemical mixtures. In thin layers of these media, the waves often appear as spirals spinning around a pivot point, but actually they are scroll-shaped waves rotating around a curved filament in three-space. The filament about which the scroll rotates is not stationary, but rather moves through space until it achieves a stable configuration or disappears altogether. Some features of the temporal evolution of a planar scroll wave filament can be understood in terms of the simple equation N = Dκ, where N is the velocity of the filament in the direction of its principal normal, κ is the curvature of the filament, and D is the diffusion coefficient of the active chemical species. This equation of motion implies that a scroll ring shrinks in size and collapses in finite time, that an elongated spiral evolves into a symmetric spiral, and that an elongated target pattern becomes more symmetrical and vanishes in finite time. Characteristic times for these processes are estimated. In each case, good quantitative agreement is found between implications of the model and observations of scroll-wave evolution in shallow layers of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reagent."
