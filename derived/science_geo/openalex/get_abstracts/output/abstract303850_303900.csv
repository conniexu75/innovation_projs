https://openalex.org/W2056023782,"The magnetic compass of European robins does not use the polarity of the magnetic field for detecting the north direction. The birds derive their north direction from interpreting the inclination of the axial direction of the magnetic field lines in space, and they take the direction on the magnetic north-south axis for ""north"" where field lines and gravity vector form the smaller angle."
https://openalex.org/W2080591118,"Audiograms are sharply tuned to a frequency close to the second harmonic of the pulse. The tuning, which is much sharper than previously reported for any vertebrate receptor, provides a mechanism whereby the bat can effectively perceive echoes even during periods of pulse-echo overlap."
https://openalex.org/W1963766388,"Labeling experiments have established that cholesterol is converted into alpha-and beta-ecdysones in isolated abdomens of silkworm larvae. Since the isolated abdomens do not contain the prothoracic glands, a doubt is cast on the long-standing principle in insect endocrinology that the prothoracic glands are the source of ecdysone secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2075192043,"Maximum values for the single-domain threshold d(0) and superpara-magnetic threshold d(8) in pure magnetite are found to be 570+/-50 and 350+/-50 angstroms, respectively. Particles larger than do but smaller than about 0.25 micron have size-dependent saturation remanences and coercive forces like those of multidomain particles, but intense and stable thermoremanent magnetization like that of single-domain particles. The presence of magnetite grains in this size range could account for the essentially single-domain character of stable natural remanence in many volcanic and intrusive rocks."
https://openalex.org/W2070534147,"Struthious and aepyornithoid eggshells from Tertiary calcareous sediments on Lanzarote prove the presence, until about 12 million years ago, of large flightless birds. The calcarenite horizon is recognized as an old land surface. Mesozoic sedimentary rocks in the basement of the volcanic islands of Lanzarote and neighboring Fuerteventura indicate that at least part of the Canary Archipelago is underlain by continental crust. Separation of the eastern Canaries from Africa might have been by rifting, and a land connection might still have existed in the lower Pliocene."

https://openalex.org/W2011635740,"A benthic marine protist (Stephanopogon) with a homokaryotic nucleus has long been considered to be a gymnostome ciliate. It has been important in hypotheses concerning the origin of ciliates, the evolution and origin of the dual nuclear apparatus of contemporary species of the Ciliophora, and the origin of the multicellular Eumetazoa. Ultrastructural observations reveal that the organism should be reclassified as a flagellate, despite its superficial resemblance to ciliates."
https://openalex.org/W2001840138,"An amber-bearing formation observed in the Dominican Republic in 1959 is described, and several insect orders, spiders, and plants found in amber are noted. An amber trace is recorded for Haiti, and the known fossil-bearing amber deposits or sites in the New World are summarized."
https://openalex.org/W2030797715,"Scanning electron microscopy of the hollow, harpoon-like radula tooth of the toxoglossan gastropod Conus has elucidated the structure and relationships of its component parts: apex, cutting edge, barbs, serration, adapical and basal openings of the lumen, external and internal folds of the shaft, and base. The functional roles of these components in prey capture are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2076675781,"The receptive fields of certain ganglion cells in the goldfish retina have been mapped. These fields are ""off"" center. ""on-off"" intermediate, and ""on"" periphery types. The excitatory process controlling the ""on"" response is stimulated maximally by green light; the ""off"" response process, inhibitory in nature, is stimulated maximally by red light. The two processes can be light adapted independently."

https://openalex.org/W2029938460,"The mating activity of the sweet-bay silk moth (Callosamia carolina) was confined to the midday period between 10 a. m. and 3 p. m. The closely related tulip-tree silk moth (Callosamia angulifera), with which Callosamia carolina is often confused, is entirely nocturnal. Reproductive isolation between these sibling species is most probably geared to these differences in circadian activity. Larvae of Callosamia carolina thrived only on the leaves of Magnolia virginiana, upon which the species was double-brooded annually."

https://openalex.org/W2052919117,"Atomic models useful for small molecules become clumsy, expensive, and even inaccurate when used to represent the large molecules important in biology. More convenient models, authoritatively designed and semi-mass-produced, would be of the greatest value both for teaching and biological research."
https://openalex.org/W1969651031,The main function of sperm banks (storage of sperm at minus 196 degrees C.) is to provide fertility insurance. In addition banks purchase sperm from donors for the impregnation of women whose husbands are sterile. Initial processing cost is $80 with an annual storage fee of $18. The average number of semen injections required to make a woman pregnant is 14 with 50% chance of pregnancy (compared to 70% with fresh sperm). With the rapid expansion of the sperm bank business a number of disturbing questions are being raised. The American Public Health Associations population council warned that sufficient data did not exist to indicate that frozen sperm would retain potency after 16 months. More serious is the fact that there are no regulations in any state governing the operation of sperm banks. The ethics of sperm banks are also in doubt. Questions are raised as to whether or not the insemination of women by anonymous donors is fostering eugenic aims and if the promise of possible fatherhood in the future is a play on the basic anxieties of the male.

https://openalex.org/W1993490276,"But when last summer the spirit of this new world which has been created by modern science, the spirit of reason, of cooperation, or internationalism, was submerged in the wave of blind nationalism which swept the world back a thousand years towards barbarism, when the crowning glory of science, the objective, impartial search for truth was forgotten, and prejudice and hate alone dictated the words and acts of men, then it was felt necessary to abandon the plans for the RIntgen celebration. But here in America where, let us hope, the spirit and the method of science still find some advocates, it is fitting that on the twentyseventh of March we bring honor and appreciation to the seventy-year-old author of one of the world's greatest discoveries-Conrad Rontgen.
