https://openalex.org/W2252568502,"CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic screens are a powerful new tool in biology. By simply altering the sequence of the single-guide RNA (sgRNA), one can reprogram Cas9 to target different sites in the genome with relative ease, but the on-target activity and off-target effects of individual sgRNAs can vary widely. Here, we use recently devised sgRNA design rules to create human and mouse genome-wide libraries, perform positive and negative selection screens and observe that the use of these rules produced improved results. Additionally, we profile the off-target activity of thousands of sgRNAs and develop a metric to predict off-target sites. We incorporate these findings from large-scale, empirical data to improve our computational design rules and create optimized sgRNA libraries that maximize on-target activity and minimize off-target effects to enable more effective and efficient genetic screens and genome engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2236156346,"Stress granules are mRNA-protein granules that form when translation initiation is limited, and they are related to pathological granules in various neurodegenerative diseases. Super-resolution microscopy reveals stable substructures, referred to as cores, within stress granules that can be purified. Proteomic analysis of stress granule cores reveals a dense network of protein-protein interactions and links between stress granules and human diseases and identifies ATP-dependent helicases and protein remodelers as conserved stress granule components. ATP is required for stress granule assembly and dynamics. Moreover, multiple ATP-driven machines affect stress granules differently, with the CCT complex inhibiting stress granule assembly, while the MCM and RVB complexes promote stress granule persistence. Our observations suggest that stress granules contain a stable core structure surrounded by a dynamic shell with assembly, disassembly, and transitions between the core and shell modulated by numerous protein and RNA remodeling complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2261479737,"Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are implicated in autoimmunity, but how they are generated and their roles in sterile inflammation remain unclear. Ribonucleoprotein immune complexes (RNP ICs), inducers of NETosis, require mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) for maximal NET stimulation. After RNP IC stimulation of neutrophils, mitochondria become hypopolarized and translocate to the cell surface. Extracellular release of oxidized mitochondrial DNA is proinflammatory in vitro, and when this DNA is injected into mice, it stimulates type I interferon (IFN) signaling through a pathway dependent on the DNA sensor STING. Mitochondrial ROS are also necessary for spontaneous NETosis of low-density granulocytes from individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus. This was also observed in individuals with chronic granulomatous disease, who lack NADPH oxidase activity but still develop autoimmunity and type I IFN signatures. Mitochondrial ROS inhibition in vivo reduces disease severity and type I IFN responses in a mouse model of lupus. Together, these findings highlight a role for mitochondria in the generation not only of NETs but also of pro-inflammatory oxidized mitochondrial DNA in autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2231009150,"We present a modular approach for analyzing calcium imaging recordings of large neuronal ensembles. Our goal is to simultaneously identify the locations of the neurons, demix spatially overlapping components, and denoise and deconvolve the spiking activity from the slow dynamics of the calcium indicator. Our approach relies on a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization that expresses the spatiotemporal fluorescence activity as the product of a spatial matrix that encodes the spatial footprint of each neuron in the optical field and a temporal matrix that characterizes the calcium concentration of each neuron over time. This framework is combined with a novel constrained deconvolution approach that extracts estimates of neural activity from fluorescence traces, to create a spatiotemporal processing algorithm that requires minimal parameter tuning. We demonstrate the general applicability of our method by applying it to in vitro and in vivo multi-neuronal imaging data, whole-brain light-sheet imaging data, and dendritic imaging data."
https://openalex.org/W2261364877,"Microglia have critical roles in neural development, homeostasis and neuroinflammation and are increasingly implicated in age-related neurological dysfunction. Neurodegeneration often occurs in disease-specific, spatially restricted patterns, the origins of which are unknown. We performed to our knowledge the first genome-wide analysis of microglia from discrete brain regions across the adult lifespan of the mouse, and found that microglia have distinct region-dependent transcriptional identities and age in a regionally variable manner. In the young adult brain, differences in bioenergetic and immunoregulatory pathways were the major sources of heterogeneity and suggested that cerebellar and hippocampal microglia exist in a more immune-vigilant state. Immune function correlated with regional transcriptional patterns. Augmentation of the distinct cerebellar immunophenotype and a contrasting loss in distinction of the hippocampal phenotype among forebrain regions were key features during aging. Microglial diversity may enable regionally localized homeostatic functions but could also underlie region-specific sensitivities to microglial dysregulation and involvement in age-related neurodegeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2236276190,"Primate visual cortex is hierarchically organized. Bottom-up and top-down influences are exerted through distinct frequency channels, as was recently revealed in macaques by correlating inter-areal influences with laminar anatomical projection patterns. Because this anatomical data cannot be obtained in human subjects, we selected seven homologous macaque and human visual areas, and we correlated the macaque laminar projection patterns to human inter-areal directed influences as measured with magnetoencephalography. We show that influences along feedforward projections predominate in the gamma band, whereas influences along feedback projections predominate in the alpha-beta band. Rhythmic inter-areal influences constrain a functional hierarchy of the seven homologous human visual areas that is in close agreement with the respective macaque anatomical hierarchy. Rhythmic influences allow an extension of the hierarchy to 26 human visual areas including uniquely human brain areas. Hierarchical levels of ventral- and dorsal-stream visual areas are differentially affected by inter-areal influences in the alpha-beta band."
https://openalex.org/W2260951263,"Despite extraordinary efforts to profile cancer genomes, interpreting the vast amount of genomic data in the light of cancer evolution remains challenging. Here we demonstrate that neutral tumor evolution results in a power-law distribution of the mutant allele frequencies reported by next-generation sequencing of tumor bulk samples. We find that the neutral power law fits with high precision 323 of 904 cancers from 14 types and from different cohorts. In malignancies identified as evolving neutrally, all clonal selection seemingly occurred before the onset of cancer growth and not in later-arising subclones, resulting in numerous passenger mutations that are responsible for intratumoral heterogeneity. Reanalyzing cancer sequencing data within the neutral framework allowed the measurement, in each patient, of both the in vivo mutation rate and the order and timing of mutations. This result provides a new way to interpret existing cancer genomic data and to discriminate between functional and non-functional intratumoral heterogeneity."
https://openalex.org/W2232938630,"Proper adaptation to environmental perturbations is essential for tissue homeostasis. In the intestine, diverse environmental cues can be sensed by immune cells, which must balance resistance to microorganisms with tolerance, avoiding excess tissue damage. By applying imaging and transcriptional profiling tools, we interrogated how distinct microenvironments in the gut regulate resident macrophages. We discovered that macrophages exhibit a high degree of gene-expression specialization dependent on their proximity to the gut lumen. Lamina propria macrophages (LpMs) preferentially expressed a pro-inflammatory phenotype when compared to muscularis macrophages (MMs), which displayed a tissue-protective phenotype. Upon luminal bacterial infection, MMs further enhanced tissue-protective programs, and this was attributed to swift activation of extrinsic sympathetic neurons innervating the gut muscularis and norepinephrine signaling to Î²2 adrenergic receptors on MMs. Our results reveal unique intra-tissue macrophage specialization and identify neuro-immune communication between enteric neurons and macrophages that induces rapid tissue-protective responses to distal perturbations."
https://openalex.org/W2237293320,"Plant roots forage the soil for minerals whose concentrations can be orders of magnitude away from those required for plant cell function. Selective uptake in multicellular organisms critically requires epithelia with extracellular diffusion barriers. In plants, such a barrier is provided by the endodermis and its Casparian strips--cell wall impregnations analogous to animal tight and adherens junctions. Interestingly, the endodermis undergoes secondary differentiation, becoming coated with hydrophobic suberin, presumably switching from an actively absorbing to a protective epithelium. Here, we show that suberization responds to a wide range of nutrient stresses, mediated by the stress hormones abscisic acid and ethylene. We reveal a striking ability of the root to not only regulate synthesis of suberin, but also selectively degrade it in response to ethylene. Finally, we demonstrate that changes in suberization constitute physiologically relevant, adaptive responses, pointing to a pivotal role of the endodermal membrane in nutrient homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2262757352,"Interfacing a single photon with another quantum system is a key capability in modern quantum information science. It allows quantum states of matter, such as spin states of atoms, atomic ensembles or solids, to be prepared and manipulated by photon counting and, in particular, to be distributed over long distances. Such light-matter interfaces have become crucial to fundamental tests of quantum physics and realizations of quantum networks. Here we report non-classical correlations between single photons and phonons--the quanta of mechanical motion--from a nanomechanical resonator. We implement a full quantum protocol involving initialization of the resonator in its quantum ground state of motion and subsequent generation and read-out of correlated photon-phonon pairs. The observed violation of a Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is clear evidence for the non-classical nature of the mechanical state generated. Our results demonstrate the availability of on-chip solid-state mechanical resonators as light-matter quantum interfaces. The performance we achieved will enable studies of macroscopic quantum phenomena as well as applications in quantum communication, as quantum memories and as quantum transducers."

https://openalex.org/W2239186975,"Tissue and organ function has been conventionally understood in terms of the interactions among discrete and homogeneous cell types. This approach has proven difficult in neuroscience due to the marked diversity across different neuron classes, but it may be further hampered by prominent within-class variability. Here, we considered a well-defined canonical neuronal populationâhippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells (CA1 PCs)âand systematically examined the extent and spatial rules of transcriptional heterogeneity. Using next-generation RNA sequencing, we identified striking variability in CA1 PCs, such that the differences within CA1 along the dorsal-ventral axis rivaled differences across distinct pyramidal neuron classes. This variability emerged from a spectrum of continuous gene-expression gradients, producing a transcriptional profile consistent with a multifarious continuum of cells. This work reveals an unexpected amount of variability within a canonical and narrowly defined neuronal population and suggests that continuous, within-class heterogeneity may be an important feature of neural circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2287379375,"Owen Rackham, Jose Polo, Julian Gough and colleagues present a method, Mogrify, for predicting sets of transcription factors that can induce transdifferentiation between cell types. They show that Mogrify is able to predict known factors for published cell conversions and experimentally validate factors for two new conversions. Transdifferentiation, the process of converting from one cell type to another without going through a pluripotent state, has great promise for regenerative medicine. The identification of key transcription factors for reprogramming is currently limited by the cost of exhaustive experimental testing of plausible sets of factors, an approach that is inefficient and unscalable. Here we present a predictive system (Mogrify) that combines gene expression data with regulatory network information to predict the reprogramming factors necessary to induce cell conversion. We have applied Mogrify to 173 human cell types and 134 tissues, defining an atlas of cellular reprogramming. Mogrify correctly predicts the transcription factors used in known transdifferentiations. Furthermore, we validated two new transdifferentiations predicted by Mogrify. We provide a practical and efficient mechanism for systematically implementing novel cell conversions, facilitating the generalization of reprogramming of human cells. Predictions are made available to help rapidly further the field of cell conversion."
https://openalex.org/W2270484149,"Analysis of synergistic muscle activations during locomotion and anatomical tracing of muscle synergy representations in the rodent spinal cord guide the development of a new spinal implant for neuromodulation therapy. In multiple rodent models of spinal cord injury, spatiotemporal stimulation that mimics naturalistic muscle activation patterns promotes improved functional recovery over previously described continuous stimulation protocols. Electrical neuromodulation of lumbar segments improves motor control after spinal cord injury in animal models and humans. However, the physiological principles underlying the effect of this intervention remain poorly understood, which has limited the therapeutic approach to continuous stimulation applied to restricted spinal cord locations. Here we developed stimulation protocols that reproduce the natural dynamics of motoneuron activation during locomotion. For this, we computed the spatiotemporal activation pattern of muscle synergies during locomotion in healthy rats. Computer simulations identified optimal electrode locations to target each synergy through the recruitment of proprioceptive feedback circuits. This framework steered the design of spatially selective spinal implants and real-time control software that modulate extensor and flexor synergies with precise temporal resolution. Spatiotemporal neuromodulation therapies improved gait quality, weight-bearing capacity, endurance and skilled locomotion in several rodent models of spinal cord injury. These new concepts are directly translatable to strategies to improve motor control in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2275847773,"Christoph Plass, Christopher Oakes and colleagues study genome-wide DNA methylation dynamics during B cell maturation and the pathogenic role of transcription factor dysregulation in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). By comparing normal and malignant B cells, they find that tumors derive from a continuum of maturation states, which correlate with different clinical outcomes. Charting differences between tumors and normal tissue is a mainstay of cancer research. However, clonal tumor expansion from complex normal tissue architectures potentially obscures cancer-specific events, including divergent epigenetic patterns. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of normal B cell subsets, we observed broad epigenetic programming of selective transcription factor binding sites coincident with the degree of B cell maturation. By comparing normal B cells to malignant B cells from 268 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we showed that tumors derive largely from a continuum of maturation states reflected in normal developmental stages. Epigenetic maturation in CLL was associated with an indolent gene expression pattern and increasingly favorable clinical outcomes. We further uncovered that most previously reported tumor-specific methylation events are normally present in non-malignant B cells. Instead, we identified a potential pathogenic role for transcription factor dysregulation in CLL, where excess programming by EGR and NFAT with reduced EBF and AP-1 programming imbalances the normal B cell epigenetic program."
https://openalex.org/W2228707969,"Recording the activity of large populations of neurons is an important step toward understanding the emergent function of neural circuits. Here we present a simple holographic method to simultaneously perform two-photon calcium imaging of neuronal populations across multiple areas and layers of mouse cortex in vivo. We use prior knowledge of neuronal locations, activity sparsity, and a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm to extract signals from neurons imaged simultaneously and located in different focal planes or fields of view. Our laser multiplexing approach is simple and fast, and could be used as a general method to image the activity of neural circuits in three dimensions across multiple areas in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2264612298,"Although the lung can undergo self-repair after injury, fibrosis in chronically injured or diseased lungs can occur at the expense of regeneration. Here we study how a hematopoietic-vascular niche regulates alveolar repair and lung fibrosis. Using intratracheal injection of bleomycin or hydrochloric acid in mice, we show that repetitive lung injury activates pulmonary capillary endothelial cells (PCECs) and perivascular macrophages, impeding alveolar repair and promoting fibrosis. Whereas the chemokine receptor CXCR7, expressed on PCECs, acts to prevent epithelial damage and ameliorate fibrosis after a single round of treatment with bleomycin or hydrochloric acid, repeated injury leads to suppression of CXCR7 expression and recruitment of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1)-expressing perivascular macrophages. This recruitment stimulates Wnt/Î²-catenin-dependent persistent upregulation of the Notch ligand Jagged1 (encoded by Jag1) in PCECs, which in turn stimulates exuberant Notch signaling in perivascular fibroblasts and enhances fibrosis. Administration of a CXCR7 agonist or PCEC-targeted Jag1 shRNA after lung injury promotes alveolar repair and reduces fibrosis. Thus, targeting of a maladapted hematopoietic-vascular niche, in which macrophages, PCECs and perivascular fibroblasts interact, may help to develop therapy to spur lung regeneration and alleviate fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2236405376,"The suppression of inappropriate actions is critical for flexible behavior. Cortical-basal ganglia networks provide key gating mechanisms for action suppression, yet the specific roles of neuronal subpopulations are poorly understood. Here, we examine Arkypallidal (ââArkyââ) and Prototypical (ââProtoââ) globus pallidus neurons during a Stop task, which requires abrupt cancellation of an imminent action. We first establish that Arky neurons can be identified by their firing properties across the natural sleep/wake cycle. We then show that Stop responses are earlier and stronger in the Arky compared to the Proto subpopulation. In contrast to other basal ganglia neurons, pallidal Stop responses are selective to Stop, rather than Go, cues. Furthermore, the timing of these Stop responses matches the suppression of developing striatal Go-related activity. Our results support a two-step model of action suppression: actions-inpreparation are first paused via a subthalamic-nigral pathway, then cancelled via Arky GABAergic projections to striatum."
https://openalex.org/W2270704840,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have emerged as promising therapeutics for many diseases, including cancer, in clinical trials. One PARP inhibitor, olaparib (Lynparza, AstraZeneca), was recently approved by the FDA to treat ovarian cancer with mutations in BRCA genes. BRCA1 and BRCA2 have essential roles in repairing DNA double-strand breaks, and a deficiency of BRCA proteins sensitizes cancer cells to PARP inhibition. Here we show that the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met associates with and phosphorylates PARP1 at Tyr907 (PARP1 pTyr907 or pY907). PARP1 pY907 increases PARP1 enzymatic activity and reduces binding to a PARP inhibitor, thereby rendering cancer cells resistant to PARP inhibition. The combination of c-Met and PARP1 inhibitors synergized to suppress the growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and xenograft tumor models, and we observed similar synergistic effects in a lung cancer xenograft tumor model. These results suggest that the abundance of PARP1 pY907 may predict tumor resistance to PARP inhibitors, and that treatment with a combination of c-Met and PARP inhibitors may benefit patients whose tumors show high c-Met expression and who do not respond to PARP inhibition alone."
https://openalex.org/W2227278846,"Changes in bone size and shape are defining features of many vertebrates. Here we use genetic crosses and comparative genomics to identify specific regulatory DNA alterations controlling skeletal evolution. Armor bone-size differences in sticklebacks map to a major effect locus overlapping BMP family member GDF6. Freshwater fish express more GDF6 due in part to a transposon insertion, and transgenic overexpression of GDF6 phenocopies evolutionary changes in armor-plate size. The human GDF6 locus also has undergone distinctive regulatory evolution, including complete loss of an enhancer that is otherwise highly conserved between chimps and other mammals. Functional tests show that the ancestral enhancer drives expression in hindlimbs but not forelimbs, in locations that have been specifically modified during the human transition to bipedalism. Both gain and loss of regulatory elements can localize BMP changes to specific anatomical locations, providing a flexible regulatory basis for evolving species-specific changes in skeletal form."
https://openalex.org/W2226873547,"Spatiotemporal trajectories are coded by ""theta sequences,"" ordered series of hippocampal place cell spikes that reflect the order of behavioral experiences. Theta sequences are thought to be organized by co-occurring gamma rhythms (â¼25-100 Hz). However, how sequences of locations are represented during distinct slow (â¼25-55 Hz) and fast (â¼60-100 Hz) gamma subtypes remains poorly understood. We found that slow gamma-associated theta sequences activated on a compressed timescale and represented relatively long paths extending ahead of the current location. Fast gamma-associated theta sequences more closely followed an animal's actual location in real time. When slow gamma occurred, sequences of locations were represented across successive slow gamma phases. Conversely, fast gamma phase coding of spatial sequences was not observed. These findings suggest that slow gamma promotes activation of temporally compressed representations of upcoming trajectories, whereas fast gamma supports coding of ongoing trajectories in real time."

This study provides novel evidence for the role of the striatum in guiding attention, dissociable from hippocampus-dependent context memory. Attention can be profoundly influenced by memory. Even something as simple as having previously viewed a picture or an array of shapes can inform where visual attention will be directed, enhancing perceptual sensitivity (Chun and Jiang, 1998Chun M.M.

The hippocampal memory system rapidly encodes episodic memories, which are flexible and rich in contextual detail (Burgess et al., 2002Burgess N. Maguire E.A. OâKeefe J. The human hippocampus and spatial and episodic memory.Neuron. 2002; 35: 625-641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar). Long-term memory for complex scenes engages the hippocampus and facilitates attention and eye movements to targets, even in the absence of explicit recall (Hannula and Ranganath, 2009Hannula D.E.

The contextual cueing effect demonstrates that memory for a repeated spatial configuration guides attention and improves performance in visual search (Chun and Jiang, 1998Chun M.M. Jiang Y.

Although these studies have demonstrated the critical role of hippocampal memory in guiding attention, memory is not a unitary process (Squire, 1992Squire L.R. Declarative and nondeclarative memory: multiple brain systems supporting learning and memory.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Different neural systems support encoding and retrieval of specific kinds of information (Henke, 2010Henke K. A model for memory systems based on processing modes rather than consciousness.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of memory for diverse cues to guide attention may depend on distinct memory systems. Unlike hippocampal memory, the striatum slowly acquires rigid associations between stimuli and responses (Bayley et al., 2005Bayley P.J. Frascino J.C. Squire L.R.

The role of the basal ganglia in habit formation.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 464-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). In healthy individuals, hippocampal and striatal systems can concurrently acquire information (Foerde and Shohamy, 2011Foerde K. Shohamy D. Feedback timing modulates brain systems for learning in humans.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 13157-13167Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and lesion studies in rats (Packard and McGaugh, 1996Packard M.G. McGaugh J.L.

A neostriatal habit learning system in humans.Science. 1996; 273: 1399-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar) have dissociated these systems. However, the influence of striatal memory on attention has not been studied. We hypothesize that people can learn and use multiple informative cues to guide attention. Furthermore, we hypothesize that changing the type of cue can change the memory system that guides attention. We developed a way to directly compare how hippocampal and striatal memory influences attention. Contextual cueing demonstrates the impact of hippocampal memory on attention in visual search. During the search task, participants search for a target (a rotated âTâ) and press a button once they find it, indicating the direction of the âTâ (Figure 1). The influence of hippocampal memory is shown via repeated configurations of target and distractors; on these trials, memory for spatial context guides attention to the exact location of the target. This effect is implicit. Participants do not have explicit memory for the repeated context (Chun and Jiang, 1998Chun M.M. Jiang Y. Contextual cueing: implicit learning and memory of visual context guides spatial attention.Cognit. Psychol. 1998; 36: 28-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar, Chun and Jiang, 2003Chun M.M.

Memory deficits for implicit contextual information in amnesic subjects with hippocampal damage.Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). While contextual cueing has been frequently replicated and provides an index of hippocampal memory guiding attention, other forms of predictive associations, potentially reliant on other memory systems, have been less studied. To address this, we modified the search task to include probabilistic stimulus-response (SR) associations known to rely on the striatum as mnemonic cues for attention. Specifically, on some trials, the target and distractors appeared in a different color. The predictive color probabilistically (80% validity) cued the target location (quadrant of the screen) and the button-press response (the direction of the âTâ). Thus, the cue evoked a âchunkedâ response of orienting to the quadrant and preparing the button press. The striatum is critical to forming such SR associations, including the chunking of motor and cognitive actions following a cue (e.g., Graybiel, 1998Graybiel A.M. The basal ganglia and chunking of action repertoires.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 1998; 70: 119-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). We randomly interleaved these cued trials, hereafter contextually cued (CC) and SR, with trials that had no mnemonic cue. The influence of both cues on attention was quantified as faster reaction time (RT) on cued compared to uncued trials. Participants improved their search performance (showed faster RT) for all trial types (F(5,170) = 108.5, p < 0.001; Figure 1D). Importantly, they showed superior performance on both CC and SR relative to no-cue trials (main effect of trial type, F(2,68) = 11.03, p < 0.001). This was replicated in a separate sample (Figure S1). There was no significant difference in RT between SR and CC trials, suggesting that both mnemonic cues comparably enhanced attention, although the learning rate differed (Figure S1). Participants were highly accurate (97.5%). There were no speed-accuracy trade-offs for memory-guided attention: accuracy on SR (97.7%) was not significantly different from that on no-cue trials (97.1%; t(34) = 1.35, p = 0.2), while CC (98%) were more accurate than no-cue trials (t(34) = 2.29, p = 0.03). Critically, SR associations were specifically evoked by the SR cue: when the SR cue (color) was absent, participants were not faster at finding the âTâ in the SR-cued quadrant (t(34) = 0.7, p = 0.5), and they were not faster in making the SR-cued response (t(34) = 1.36, p = 0.2), indicating that the benefit on SR trials was specifically elicited by the SR cue. Furthermore, the cued response involved more than a simple button press after viewing the SR color (Figure S2). To test whether memory for CC and SR associations was explicit, we probed memory for âTâ location quadrant (CC and SR) and button-press response (SR). Participants did not differ from chance (25%) in recalling the âTâ location on CC (mean accuracy = 23.9% [SEM = 1.8%]; t(34) = 0.59, p = 0.6) or SR trials (mean accuracy = 29.2% [SEM = 2.8%]; t(34) = 1.5, p = 0.14) and did not differ from chance (50%) in recalling the motor response on SR trials (mean accuracy = 45.7% [SEM = 4.2%]; t(34) = 1.0, p = 0.3). These results demonstrate that memories for CC and SR associations implicitly guided attention. We hypothesized that changes in attention resulting from these memories depended on different neural systems. To test this, we examined blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses as participants performed the task, enabling us probe memory-guided attention as it unfolded (Karuza et al., 2014Karuza E.A. Emberson L.L. Aslin R.N. Combining fMRI and behavioral measures to examine the process of human learning.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 2014; 109: 193-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We investigated how neural systems supporting memory influence attention trial by trial. Earlier work on episodic memory has shown that activity at encoding predicts retrieval success (Wagner et al., 1998Wagner A.D. Schacter D.L. Rotte M. Koutstaal W. Maril A. Dale A.M. Rosen B.R. Buckner R.L. Building memories: remembering and forgetting of verbal experiences as predicted by brain activity.Science. 1998; 281: 1188-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Here, we examined whether trial-evoked BOLD responses (Figure S3) could predict memory-guided attention (RT) on the subsequent trial (Figure 2A). We anatomically defined a priori regions of interest (ROIs; hippocampus and striatum). In one set of linear regressions, signals from both hippocampus and striatum were predictors of subsequent RT. To understand the contributions of subregions, we also ran separate linear regressions in which one subregion at a time served as the predictor. Our subsequent attention effect (SAE) analysis revealed that BOLD signal in the hippocampus significantly predicted subsequent attention on CC trials (mean Î² = 0.03, p = 0.03) while striatal signal did not (Figure 2B). The hippocampus was a stronger predictor of CC-based SAE than the striatum (Î² = â0.02, t(34) = 2.18, p = 0.04). In separate regressions, almost all hippocampal subregions significantly predicted CC-based SAE (full hippocampus: Î² = 0.028, p = 0.049; left: Î² = 0.03, p = 0.007; right: Î² = 0.025, p = 0.09, anterior: Î² = 0.028, p = 0.047; posterior: Î² = 0.034, p = 0.01; Figure 2C), but activity in striatal regions did not. Positive hippocampal Î² values indicate that lower hippocampal signal predicts greater SAE (lower RT) on CC trials. We observed the opposite pattern on SR trials. BOLD signal in the striatum predicted SR-based SAE (Î² = â0.04, p = 0.02), while hippocampal signal did not (Figure 2B). When we ran separate regressions, signal in all striatal subregions predicted SR-based SAE (full striatum: Î² = â0.049, p = 0.003; caudate: Î² = â0.047, p = 0.003; putamen: Î² = â0.042, p = 0.01), but signal in hippocampal regions did not (Figure 2C). Negative Î² values indicate that a higher striatal signal predicts greater SAE on SR trials. These results dissociate hippocampal and striatal involvement in CC- and SR-guided attention. To probe neural networks of SAEs, we ran an analogous analysis using trial-evoked responses in the hippocampus and striatum to predict subsequent BOLD responses in other regions (Figure 2D). We used trial-evoked responses from the hippocampus and striatum as parametric modulators for CC and SR trials, testing where hippocampal response on CC trial t predicted BOLD signal on CC trial t + 1 and where striatal response predicted subsequent BOLD on SR trials. As decreased hippocampal BOLD predicted CC-based SAE, we probed negative correlations with the hippocampus and, as increased striatal BOLD predicted SR-based SAE, we probed positive correlations with the striatum (Table 1). These analyses revealed distinct networks for striatum- and hippocampus-guided subsequent attention (Figure 2E).Table 1Regions Tracking SAE: Activity on Trial t + 1 Predicted by Signal on Trial tCC-Based SAE: Hippocampal SignalXYZZ ScoreFrontalL precentral gyrusâ48â4343.4714â24464.24L central opercular cortex/insulaâ38â8143.79L central opercular cortexâ46â8183.59ParietalL central opercular cortex/postcentral gyrusâ54â18203.62L central opercular cortex/parietal operculum cortexâ54â22203.7R precuneus12â54503.65L precuneus0â80404.670â52483.68â2â64543.51TemporalL temporal poleâ4012â183.65OccipitalL occipital poleâ4â90383.86SubcorticalL putamenâ268â43.94L putamen/white matterâ202â123.5â248â123.48L caudateâ16â1443.73L thalamusâ4â824.11SR-Based SAE: Striatal SignalXYZZ ScoreFrontalR frontal pole3858203.63252184.35384863.27344683.043440224.55R frontal pole/middle frontal gyrus3640323.5L frontal orbital cortexâ3624â43.28R anterior cingulate2â4383.99L anterior cingulate012404.55R paracingulate228324.12420403.71R anterior insula38803.81â428â63.21L anterior insulaâ38423.58OccipitalL temporal-occipital-fusiform cortexâ28â54â144.04R lateral occipital cortex, superior28â80224.4916â86203.98R lateral occipital cortex, inferior42â66â64.1738â7444.35R occipital pole16â90184SubcorticalL amygdala/white matterâ202â144.08L putamenâ264â123.71Table includes peak and local maxima.

To better understand brain regions involved across memory- and visually guided search, we identified areas that were commonly active on accurate CC, SR, and no-cue trials (following Summerfield et al., 2006Summerfield J.J. Lepsien J. Gitelman D.R. Mesulam M.M. Nobre A.C. Orienting attention based on long-term memory experience.Neuron. 2006; 49: 905-916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Using a generalized linear model (GLM), we separately identified regions that were significantly active in three contrasts: (voxel-wise corrected p < 0.05): CC versus baseline, SR versus baseline, and no-cue versus baseline (accurate only). To test for significant activity in all contrasts, we performed a conjunction analysis, taking the maximum p value from these maps (Nichols et al., 2005Nichols T. Brett M. Andersson J. Wager T. Poline J.B. Valid conjunction inference with the minimum statistic.Neuroimage. 2005; 25: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). Peak and local maxima are shown in Table S1 and Figure 2E. These include the anterior insula, precentral sulcus, superior parietal lobule, and lateral occipital cortex. Next, we probed whether BOLD signal in our ROIs correlated with individual differences in memory-guided attention. We quantified memory-guided attention as the difference in RT between no-cue and memory-cued trials during the second half of the experiment (Chun and Jiang, 1998Chun M.M. Jiang Y. Contextual cueing: implicit learning and memory of visual context guides spatial attention.Cognit. Psychol. 1998; 36: 28-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1468) Google Scholar). This revealed considerable variability across participants (Figure 3A). To understand how the hippocampus and striatum contribute to this variability, we used a GLM to derive BOLD estimates per trial type per ROI. We then correlated these responses with attention benefits from each mnemonic cue and compared the dependent correlations (Steiger, 1980Steiger J.H. Tests for comparing elements of a correlation matrix.Psychol. Bull. 1980; 87: 245-251Crossref Scopus (3383) Google Scholar, Equations 3, 10, and 14). Our metric of memory-guided attention uses performance in the second half of the experiment, raising the question of whether early or late BOLD signal would predict individual differences. Early hippocampal signal predicts later contextual cueing effects (Giesbrecht et al., 2013Giesbrecht B. Sy J.L. Guerin S.A. Both memory and attention systems contribute to visual search for targets cued by implicitly learned context.Vision Res. 2013; 85: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but striatal learning tends to follow a slower time course (Henke, 2010Henke K. A model for memory systems based on processing modes rather than consciousness.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2010; 11: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). We examined whether BOLD responses during the first or second half of the experiment correlated with individual differences in later memory-guided attention. BOLD responses in the posterior hippocampus (CC > no cue) during the first half correlated with later CC-guided attention (r = â0.41, p = 0.01), such that participants with lower hippocampal responses on CC than on no-cue trials showed greater CC-guided attention. Striatal signal did not correlate with CC-guided attention. In contrast, for SR-guided attention, responses in the putamen (SR > no cue) during the second half trended toward correlating with SR-guided attention (r = 0.32, p = 0.06), such that those with higher putamen responses on SR than no-cue trials showed greater SR-guided attention. Hippocampal signal did not correlate with SR-guided attention. To facilitate comparison of CC- and SR-guided attention, we contrasted BOLD responses on CC versus SR trials, further demonstrating divergent temporal trajectories. Striatal signal during the second half was significantly more correlated with individual differences in SR-guided attention than striatal signal during the first half (SR > CCâfirst half: r = â0.17, second half: r = 0.27; Z = 2.4, p = 0.02). Hippocampal BOLD during the first half trended toward correlating more with variability in CC-guided than in SR-guided attention (CC > SRâCC: r = â0.22, SR: r = 0.07; Z = 1.8, p = 0.07). This difference was significant in the left hippocampus (CC: r = â0.28, SR: r = 0.05; Z = 2.07, p = 0.04). Given these different time courses, we examined whether change in signal from the first to the second half of the experiment correlated with individual differences in memory-guided attention (Figures 3B and 3C). Changes in striatal BOLD were significantly more correlated with variability in SR-guided attention (SR > CCâr = 0.42, p = 0.01) than in CC-guided attention (SR > CCâr = 0.04; Z = 2.5, p = 0.01; also caudate [SR: r = 0.38, p = 0.03; CC: r = â0.03; Z = 2.6, p = 0.008] and putamen [SR: r = 0.42, p = 0.01; CC: r = 0.08; Z = 2.2, p = 0.03]). Conversely, changes in hippocampal BOLD trended toward being more correlated with variability in CC-guided attention (CC > SRâr = 0.26) than in SR-guided attention (CC > SRâr = â0.03; Z = â1.88, p = 0.06). This dissociation was significant in the left hippocampus (CC: r = 0.26; SR: r = â0.07; Z = â2.08, p = 0.04) and posterior hippocampus (CC: r = 0.24; SR: r = â0.1; Z = â2.21, p = 0.03). This study demonstrates that multiple mnemonic cues facilitate attention via distinct neural systems. In our visual search task, participants showed subsequent attention benefits (faster RT) after learning CC and SR associations. By changing the cue, this task changed the memory system that guided attention: the hippocampus for CC-guided attention and the striatum for SR-guided attention. Trial by trial, trial-evoked BOLD responses in each region predicted RT on the subsequent exposure to the corresponding mnemonic cue. BOLD signal in these regions also correlated with individual differences in memory-guided attention. Our trial-by-trial subsequent attention analysis revealed a double dissociation of neural regions involved in CC and SR learning. Analogous to the subsequent memory effect (Wagner et al., 1998Wagner A.D. Schacter D.L. Rotte M. Koutstaal W. Maril A. Dale A.M. Rosen B.R. Buckner R.L. Building memories: remembering and forgetting of verbal experiences as predicted by brain activity.Science. 1998; 281: 1188-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar), imaging data were sorted based on later behavior, allowing us to probe BOLD activity that predicted memory-specific behavior changes. Trial-evoked responses in the hippocampus on a CC trial significantly predicted attention on the next CC trial, while striatal responses did not. The opposite pattern was observed on SR trials: striatal responses predicted subsequent attention, while hippocampal responses did not. This demonstrates the role of multiple memory systems in contributing to a dynamic, integrated priority map that guides attention (Awh et al., 2012Awh E. Belopolsky A.V. Theeuwes J. Top-down versus bottom-up attentional control: a failed theoretical dichotomy.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2012; 16: 437-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). To understand brain networks in memory-guided attention, we conducted an analogous analysis in which trial-evoked responses predicted BOLD activity in other regions. While both hippocampus and striatum predicted subsequent BOLD in the insula, occipital pole, and putamen, these networks also had distinct features, revealing differences in how these memory systems guide attention. Several regions have previously been related to memory-guided attention: for the hippocampus, the precuneus (Rosen et al., 2015Rosen M.L. Stern C.E. Michalka S.W. Devaney K.J. Somers D.C.

Attention to memory and the environment: functional specialization and dynamic competition in human posterior parietal cortex.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 8445-8456Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and left caudate (Summerfield et al., 2006Summerfield J.J. Lepsien J. Gitelman D.R. Mesulam M.M. Nobre A.C. Orienting attention based on long-term memory experience.Neuron. 2006; 49: 905-916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and, for the striatum, the anterior cingulate (Rosen et al., 2015Rosen M.L. Stern C.E. Michalka S.W. Devaney K.J. Somers D.C. Cognitive control network contributions to memory-guided visual attention.Cereb. Cortex. 2015; (Published online March 5, 2015)https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhv028Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar, Summerfield et al., 2006Summerfield J.J. Lepsien J. Gitelman D.R. Mesulam M.M. Nobre A.C. Orienting attention based on long-term memory experience.Neuron. 2006; 49: 905-916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The anterior cingulate functions as part of a circuit with the striatum (Alexander et al., 1986Alexander G.E. DeLong M.R. Strick P.L. Parallel organization of functionally segregated circuits linking basal ganglia and cortex.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1986; 9: 357-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (6737) Google Scholar). In general, regions identified by this analysis overlapped with areas identified by our conjunction analysis, which correspond to the dorsal frontoparietal network (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002Corbetta M. Shulman G.L. Control of goal-directed and stimulus-driven attention in the brain.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (8674) Google Scholar). Our individual difference analyses highlighted the ability of memory regions to explain variability in CC- and SR-guided attention. Hippocampal BOLD, particularly the left and posterior hippocampus (previously correlated with contextual cueing; Greene et al., 2007Greene A.J. Gross W.L. Elsinger C.L. Rao S.M. Hippocampal differentiation without recognition: an fMRI analysis of the contextual cueing task.Learn. Mem. 2007; 14: 548-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) correlated more with variability in CC-guided than in SR-guided attention. By contrast, striatal BOLD correlated more with variability in SR-guided than in CC-guided attention. We also observed distinct temporal trajectories: CC-guided attention correlated more with early hippocampal BOLD, while SR-guided attention correlated more with late striatal BOLD. Early hippocampal activity predicts later contextual cueing (Giesbrecht et al., 2013Giesbrecht B. Sy J.L. Guerin S.A. Both memory and attention systems contribute to visual search for targets cued by implicitly learned context.Vision Res. 2013; 85: 80-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of initial encoding. By contrast, striatal projection neurons change firing patterns gradually, showing increased coherence later in learning (Graybiel, 1998Graybiel A.M. The basal ganglia and chunking of action repertoires.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 1998; 70: 119-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). These trajectories have been shown previously, with the MTL active initially and the caudate active later in learning (Poldrack et al., 2001Poldrack R.A. Clark J. ParÃ©-Blagoev E.J. Shohamy D. Creso Moyano J. Myers C. Gluck M.A. Interactive memory systems in the human brain.Nature. 2001; 414: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). We observed distinct directionality in hippocampus- and striatum-guided attention, with lower hippocampal and higher striatal BOLD predicting facilitated attention. This striatal pattern is consistent with habit studies that show increased striatal activity over the course of training (Tricomi et al., 2009Tricomi E. Balleine B.W. OâDoherty J.P. A specific role for posterior dorsolateral striatum in human habit learning.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 2225-2232Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). However, the hippocampus does not show consistent directionality. Other studies have also found that lower hippocampal signal during repeated encoding (Vannini et al., 2013Vannini P. Hedden T. Sullivan C. Sperling R.A. Differential functional response in the posteromedial cortices and hippocampus to stimulus repetition during successful memory encoding.Hum. Brain Mapp. 2013; 34: 1568-1578Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, Ward et al., 2013Ward E.J. Chun M.M.

The role of the hippocampus in memory-guided attention is mixed, with decreased (Rosen et al., 2015Rosen M.L. Stern C.E. Michalka S.W. Devaney K.J. Somers D.C. Cognitive control network contributions to memory-guided visual attention.Cereb. Cortex. 2015; (Published online March 5, 2015)https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhv028Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and increased (Stokes et al., 2012Stokes M.G. Atherton K. Patai E.Z. Nobre A.C. Long-term memory prepares neural activity for perception.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: E360-E367Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, Summerfield et al., 2006Summerfield J.J.

Orienting attention based on long-term memory experience.Neuron. 2006; 49: 905-916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) activity related to facilitated attention. It is possible that the explicit nature of the memory plays a role. Repetition suppression in several MTL areas has been related to (implicit) repetition priming but not explicit memory (Ward et al., 2013Ward E.J. Chun M.M. Kuhl B.A. Repetition suppression and multi-voxel pattern similarity differentially track implicit and explicit visual memory.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 14749-14757Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), although increased hippocampal activity has been shown before retrieval of implicit memory (Hannula and Ranganath, 2009Hannula D.E. Ranganath C. The eyes have it: hippocampal activity predicts expression of memory in eye movements.Neuron. 2009; 63: 592-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Thus, while the hippocampus is commonly recruited in memory-guided attention, the directionality of hippocampal BOLD activity in relation to implicit and explicit memory deserves further study. Using a stimulus that probabilistically (80% validity) predicted a response, we demonstrated that striatal memory could guide attention. Previous research on top-down control of attention has shown that participants can successfully orient attention based on probabilistic cues. However, in prior studies, the association between cue and response was instructed and explicit, leading to specific preparatory control signals (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002Corbetta M. Shulman G.L. Control of goal-directed and stimulus-driven attention in the brain.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (8674) Google Scholar) and enhanced efficiency. Such explicit associations between stimuli and responses are unlikely to rely on the striatal memory system (Graybiel, 1998Graybiel A.M. The basal ganglia and chunking of action repertoires.Neurobiol. Learn. Mem. 1998; 70: 119-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, Yin and Knowlton, 2006Yin H.H. Knowlton B.J. The role of the basal ganglia in habit formation.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 464-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). By contrast, in our study, the relationship was implicit. Striatal memory is recruited in situations for which the appropriate response to the cue is unclear (Foerde and Shohamy, 2011Foerde K. Shohamy D. Feedback timing modulates brain systems for learning in humans.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 13157-13167Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, Knowlton et al., 1996Knowlton B.J. Mangels J.A. Squire L.R. A neostriatal habit learning system in humans.Science. 1996; 273: 1399-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar), requiring gradual trial-and-error learning. Although the goal of the current study was to dissociate the contributions of hippocampal and striatal memory to attention, these memory systems do not typically function in isolation. In real-world search, multiple types of information (which may be learned by distinct systems) can facilitate target detection (Chun and Turk-Browne, 2007Chun M.M. Turk-Browne N.B. Interactions between attention and memory.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In some situations, both systems are required for optimal performance (Shohamy et al., 2009Shohamy D. Myers C.E. Hopkins R.O. Sage J. Gluck M.A. Distinct hippocampal and basal ganglia contributions to probabilistic learning and reversal.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2009; 21: 1821-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), while in others, factors such as distraction (Foerde et al., 2006Foerde K. Knowlton B.J. Poldrack R.A. Modulation of competing memory systems by distraction.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 11778-11783Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar), duration of training (Poldrack et al., 2001Poldrack R.A. Clark J. ParÃ©-Blagoev E.J. Shohamy D. Creso Moyano J. Myers C. Gluck M.A. Interactive memory systems in the human brain.Nature. 2001; 414: 546-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), or stress (Schwabe and Wolf, 2012Schwabe L. Wolf O.T. Stress modulates the engagement of multiple memory systems in classification learning.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 11042-11049Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) influence which memory system will dominate performance. Future research is necessary to determine how hippocampal and striatal memory interact to influence attention in such scenarios. This research was approved by New York Universityâs University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects. For monetary compensation, 35 right-handed participants (51% female, mean age = 21.7 years) completed the study. Based on power analyses from prior behavioral data (Figure S1), 35 participants were needed for a power level of 0.08 (Î± = 0.05). After 24 practice trials, participants completed 576 trials of visual search for a target among distractors (Figure 1). Following fixation, participants had up to 4 s to locate the âTâ and make a response. As soon as the participant responded, this screen disappeared. Next, a feedback screen showed points earned (based on speed and accuracy). Participants completed 576 trials over six scanning runs. Across trials, we controlled for factors (such as âTâ location) that could bias visual search (details in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Search trials had no mnemonic cue, CC, or probabilistic SR cues. On CC trials, repeated spatial configurations cued the exact âTâ location but did not cue the response (50% probability). On SR trials, the color of the shapes cued (80% probability) the location of the âTâ and the response (see Figure S2 for design of SR trials). These mnemonic cues were never presented togetherâthat is, the CC trials were never presented in the SR-predictive color, and the spatial configuration of SR trials was randomly generated.

https://openalex.org/W2239966924,"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as important regulators in various biological processes. However, to date, no systematic characterization of lncRNAs has been reported in the silkworm Bombyx mori. In the present study, we generated eighteen RNA-seq datasets with relatively high depth. Using an in-house designed lncRNA identification pipeline, 11,810 lncRNAs were identified for 5,556 loci. Among these lncRNAs, 474 transcripts were intronic lncRNAs (ilncRNAs), 6,250 transcripts were intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs), and 5,086 were natural antisense lncRNAs (lncNATs). Compared with protein-coding mRNAs, silkworm lncRNAs are shorter in terms of full length but longer in terms of exon and intron length. In addition, lncRNAs exhibit a lower level of sequence conservation, more repeat sequences overlapped and higher tissue specificity than protein-coding mRNAs in the silkworm. We found that 69 lncRNA transcripts from 33 gene loci may function as miRNA precursors, and 104 lncRNA transcripts from 72 gene loci may act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). In total, 49.47% of all gene loci (2,749/5,556) for which lncRNAs were identified showed sex-biased expression. Co-expression network analysis resulted in 19 modules, 12 of which revealed relatively high tissue specificity. The highlighted darkgoldenrod module was specifically associated with middle and posterior silk glands, and the hub lncRNAs within this module were co-expressed with proteins involved in translation, translocation, and secretory processes, suggesting that these hub lncRNAs may function as regulators of the biosynthesis, translocation, and secretion of silk proteins. This study presents the first comprehensive genome-wide analysis of silkworm lncRNAs and provides an invaluable resource for genetic, evolutionary, and genomic studies of B. mori."
https://openalex.org/W2229355517,"Spontaneous bursts of activity in developing sensory pathways promote maturation of neurons, refinement of neuronal connections, and assembly of appropriate functional networks. In the developing auditory system, inner hair cells (IHCs) spontaneously fire Ca(2+) spikes, each of which is transformed into a mini-burst of action potentials in spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Here we show that NMDARs are expressed in SGN dendritic terminals and play a critical role during transmission of activity from IHCs to SGNs before hearing onset. NMDAR activation enhances glutamate-mediated Ca(2+) influx at dendritic terminals, promotes repetitive firing of individual SGNs in response to each synaptic event, and enhances coincident activity of neighboring SGNs that will eventually encode similar frequencies of sound. Loss of NMDAR signaling from SGNs reduced their survival both in vivo and in vitro, revealing that spontaneous activity in the prehearing cochlea promotes maturation of auditory circuitry through periodic activation of NMDARs in SGNs."
https://openalex.org/W2272711685,"Thymic T-cell development is initiated from bone marrow-derived multi-potent thymus seeding progenitors (TSPs). During the early stages of thymocyte differentiation progenitors become T-cell restricted. However, the cellular environments supporting these critical initial stages of T-cell development within the thymic cortex are not known. We here use the dependence of early, c-Kitâexpressing thymic progenitors on Kit ligand (KitL) to show that CD4âCD8âc-Kit+CD25â DN1-stage progenitors associate with, and depend on the membrane-bound form of KitL (mKitL) provided by, a cortex-specific KitL-expressing vascular endothelial cell (VEC) population. In contrast, the subsequent CD4âCD8âc-Kit+CD25+ DN2 stage progenitors associate selectively with cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs) and depend on cTEC-presented mKitL. These results show that the dynamic process of early thymic progenitor differentiation is paralleled by migration-dependent changes to the supporting niche, and identify VECs as a thymic niche cell, with mKitL as a critical ligand."
https://openalex.org/W2222003660,"The DENN domain is an evolutionary conserved protein module found in all eukaryotes and serves as an exchange factor for Rab-GTPases to regulate diverse cellular functions. Variants in DENND1B are associated with development of childhood asthma and other immune disorders. To understand how DENND1B may contribute to human disease, Dennd1b(-/-) mice were generated and exhibit hyper-allergic responses following antigen challenge. Dennd1b(-/-) TH2, but not other TH cells, exhibit delayed receptor-induced T cell receptor (TCR) downmodulation, enhanced TCR signaling, and increased production of effector cytokines. As DENND1B interacts with AP-2 and Rab35, TH2 cells deficient in AP-2 or Rab35 also exhibit enhanced TCR-mediated effector functions. Moreover, human TH2 cells carrying asthma-associated DENND1B variants express less DENND1B and phenocopy Dennd1b(-/-) TH2 cells. These results provide a molecular basis for how DENND1B, a previously unrecognized regulator of TCR downmodulation in TH2 cells, contributes to asthma pathogenesis and how DENN-domain-containing proteins may contribute to other human disorders."

Although 2HG has been detected in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, its metabolism in yeast has remained largely unexplored. Here, we show that S. cerevisiae actively forms the d enantiomer of 2HG. Accordingly, the S. cerevisiae genome encodes two homologs of the human d-2HG dehydrogenase: Dld2, which, as its human homolog, is a mitochondrial protein, and the cytosolic protein Dld3. Intriguingly, we found that a dld3Î knock-out strain accumulates millimolar levels of d-2HG, whereas a dld2Î knock-out strain displayed only very moderate increases in d-2HG. Recombinant Dld2 and Dld3, both currently annotated as d-lactate dehydrogenases, efficiently oxidized d-2HG to Î±-ketoglutarate. Depletion of d-lactate levels in the dld3Î, but not in the dld2Î mutant, led to the discovery of a new type of enzymatic activity, carried by Dld3, to convert d-2HG to Î±-ketoglutarate, namely an FAD-dependent transhydrogenase activity using pyruvate as a hydrogen acceptor. We also provide evidence that Ser3 and Ser33, which are primarily known for oxidizing 3-phosphoglycerate in the main serine biosynthesis pathway, in addition reduce Î±-ketoglutarate to d-2HG using NADH and represent major intracellular sources of d-2HG in yeast. Based on our observations, we propose that d-2HG is mainly formed and degraded in the cytosol of S. cerevisiae cells in a process that couples d-2HG metabolism to the shuttling of reducing equivalents from cytosolic NADH to the mitochondrial respiratory chain via the d-lactate dehydrogenase Dld1.

Ingerslev J. Rasmussen K. Low molecular weight organic acids in the urine of the newborn.Acta Paediatr. Scand. 1977; 66: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because of the hydroxyl group on the second carbon, 2HG exists under two enantiomeric configurations (l or d) that can be separated by gas or liquid chromatography after derivatization with another chiral compound and that can therefore be differentially assayed in biological samples using GC-MS or LC-MS methods (2Gibson K.M. ten Brink H.J. Schor D.S. Kok R.M. Bootsma A.H. Hoffmann G.F. Jakobs C. Stable-isotope dilution analysis of d- and l-2-hydroxyglutaric acid: application to the detection and prenatal diagnosis of d- and l-2-hydroxyglutaric acidemias.Pediatr.

Chem. 2004; 50: 1391-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The interest in 2HG increased when it was found to accumulate in urine of patients with suspected inborn errors of metabolism (4Chalmers R.A. Lawson A.M. Watts R.W. Tavill A.S. Kamerling J.P. Hey E. Ogilvie D. d-2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria: case report and biochemical studies.J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1980; 3: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 5Duran M. Kamerling J.P.

Most 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria patients present elevations of either l-2HG or d-2HG in their extracellular fluids, and the clinical phenotype depends on the configuration of the accumulated organic acid. More recently, cases of âcombined d,l-hydroxyglutaric aciduriaâ have been reported (6Muntau A.C. RÃ¶schinger W. Merkenschlager A. van der Knaap M.S. Jakobs C. Duran M. Hoffmann G.F. Roscher A.A.

It is now established that l-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the L2HGDH gene, encoding a specific l-2HG dehydrogenase, whereas in many cases d-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria results from loss-of-function mutations in the D2HGDH gene, which encodes a dehydrogenase acting on d-2HG (7Kranendijk M. Struys E.A. Salomons G.S. Van der Knaap M.S. Jakobs C. Progress in understanding 2-hydroxyglutaric acidurias.J. Inherit. Metab.

Dis. 2009; 32: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Other cases of d-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria are caused by gain-of-function mutations in the mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase gene IDH2 (9Kranendijk M. Struys E.A. van Schaftingen E. Gibson K.M. Kanhai W.A. van der Knaap M.S. Amiel J. Buist N.R. Das A.M. de Klerk J.B. Feigenbaum A.S. Grange D.K. Hofstede F.C. Holme E. Kirk E.P. et al.IDH2 mutations in patients with d-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria.Science. 2010; 330: 336Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Interestingly, somatic IDH1 (cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase) and IDH2 mutations leading to increased d-2HG production have also been identified in a number of cancers, including gliomas and acute myelogenous leukemia (10Losman J.A. Kaelin Jr., W.G. What a difference a hydroxyl makes: mutant IDH, (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, and cancer.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 836-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Increased 2HG levels have in addition been detected in human breast tumors with wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) (11Terunuma A. Putluri N. Mishra P. MathÃ© E.A. Dorsey T.H. Yi M. Wallace T.A. Issaq H.J. Zhou M. Killian J.K. Stevenson H.S. Karoly E.D. Chan K. Samanta S. Prieto D. et al.MYC-driven accumulation of 2-hydroxyglutarate is associated with breast cancer prognosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2014; 124: 398-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). d-2HG is therefore suspected to act as an oncometabolite (10Losman J.A. Kaelin Jr., W.G. What a difference a hydroxyl makes: mutant IDH, (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate, and cancer.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 836-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Combined d,l-hydroxyglutaric aciduria is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial citrate carrier SLC25A1 (12Nota B. Struys E.A. Pop A. Jansen E.E. Fernandez Ojeda M.R. Kanhai W.A.

The cancer-associated mutant IDH1 and IDH2 enzymes actively convert Î±-ketoglutarate to d-2HG leading to high (millimolar) intracellular concentrations of the latter. It is less clear which is the main source of d-2HG in normal mammalian tissues. Hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase (ADHFE1) catalyzes the conversion of Î³-hydroxybutyrate to succinic semialdehyde with concomitant reduction of Î±-ketoglutarate to d-2HG (13Kardon T. NoÃ«l G. Vertommen D. Schaftingen E.V. Identification of the gene encoding hydroxyacid-oxoacid transhydrogenase, an enzyme that metabolizes 4-hydroxybutyrate.FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2347-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Human phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase was also recently found to convert Î±-ketoglutarate to d-2HG, using NADH as a cofactor (14Fan J. Teng X. Liu L. Mattaini K.R. Looper R.E. Vander Heiden M.G. Rabinowitz J.D. Human phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase produces the oncometabolite d-2-hydroxyglutarate.ACS Chem. Biol. 2015; 10: 510-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Finally, there is evidence that wild-type IDH1 and IDH2 also slowly form d-2HG from Î±-ketoglutarate (15Matsunaga H. Futakuchi-Tsuchida A. Takahashi M. Ishikawa T. Tsuji M. Ando O. IDH1 and IDH2 have critical roles in 2-hydroxyglutarate production in d-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase depleted cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2012; 423: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A known source of l-2HG in mammalian cells is a low side activity of malate dehydrogenase, converting Î±-ketoglutarate to l-2HG at the expense of NADH (16Rzem R. Achouri Y. Marbaix E. Schakman O. Wiame E. Marie S. Gailly P. Vincent M.F. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E.

Such an l-2HG-producing side activity has also been demonstrated for the mitochondrial malate dehydrogenases of Arabidopsis thaliana (18HÃ¼dig M. Maier A. Scherrers I. Seidel L. Jansen E.E. Mettler-Altmann T. Engqvist M.K. Maurino V.G. Plants possess a cyclic mitochondrial metabolic pathway similar to the mammalian metabolic repair mechanism involving malate dehydrogenase and l-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase.Plant Cell Physiol. 2015; 56: 1820-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Lactate dehydrogenase A has recently been described as a major source of l-2HG in mammalian cells under hypoxia (19Intlekofer A.M. Dematteo R.G. Venneti S. Finley L.W. Lu C. Judkins A.R. Rustenburg A.S. Grinaway P.B. Chodera J.D. Cross J.R. Thompson C.B. Hypoxia induces production of l-2-hydroxyglutarate.Cell Metab. 2015; 22: 304-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Isotopic labeling studies using [13C]glucose and [2H]glutamate strongly indicate that, in the mammalian system, d-2HG and l-2HG are derived from the mitochondrial pool of Î±-ketoglutarate (20Struys E.A. Gibson K.M. Jakobs C. Novel insights into l-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria: mass isotopomer studies reveal 2-oxoglutaric acid as the metabolic precursor of l-2-hydroxyglutaric acid.J. Inherit. Metab.

In agreement with this, both the mammalian d- and l-2HG dehydrogenases were shown to be localized in the mitochondria (22Achouri Y. NoÃ«l G. Vertommen D. Rider M.H. Veiga-Da-Cunha M. Van Schaftingen E. Identification of a dehydrogenase acting on d-2-hydroxyglutarate.Biochem. J. 2004; 381: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Rzem R. Van Schaftingen E.

In contrast to the mammalian system, very little is known about the occurrence of 2-hydroxyglutarate and its metabolism in yeast. 2HG was detected in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cultures grown anaerobically in the presence of glucose and of glutamate as the sole nitrogen source (24Albers E. Gustafsson L. Niklasson C. LidÃ©n G. Distribution of 14C-labelled carbon from glucose and glutamate during anaerobic growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 14C labeling of either the supplemented glucose or glutamate revealed that 2HG was entirely derived from glutamate under these conditions. The purpose of the present work was to determine whether S. cerevisiae produces the l and/or the d enantiomer of 2HG and to identify the enzymes involved in the formation and degradation of this organic acid in yeast. We show that S. cerevisiae only forms detectable amounts of the d form of 2HG under standard yeast cultivation conditions (aerobic batch cultures in minimal defined medium supplemented with glucose) and that the main enzyme responsible for its degradation is encoded by the DLD3 gene, currently annotated as a d-lactate dehydrogenase. We found that this cytosolic protein actually converts d-2HG to Î±-ketoglutarate with concomitant reduction of pyruvate to d-lactate, qualifying this enzyme as a transhydrogenase rather than a dehydrogenase. Finally, we show that the Ser3 and Ser33 proteins, known to catalyze the oxidation of 3-phosphoglycerate in the first step of the main yeast serine biosynthesis pathway, in addition catalyze the NADH-dependent conversion of Î±-ketoglutarate to d-2HG. The physiological significance of these reactions is discussed in the light of our findings. Reagents, of analytical grade whenever possible, were acquired from Sigma, unless otherwise indicated. LC-MS grade solvents were from VWR Chemicals. Yeast Dld2 and Dld3 protein sequences were obtained from the NCBI protein database or from the Saccharomyces Genome Database. The protein sequences were then aligned using ClustalW2 (25Larkin M.A. Blackshields G. Brown N.P. Chenna R. McGettigan P.A. McWilliam H. Valentin F. Wallace I.M. Wilm A. Lopez R. Thompson J.D.

The phylogenetic relationships between those proteins were analyzed using the Neighbor-Joining (Poisson distance model) and the Maximum-Likelihood (LG substitution model) methods. These analyses were performed with the SeaView (26Gouy M. Guindon S. Gascuel O. SeaView version 4: a multiplatform graphical user interface for sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree building.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2010; 27: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (4155) Google Scholar) and PhyML (27Guindon S. Gascuel O. A simple, fast, and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood.Syst. Biol. 2003; 52: 696-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (14200) Google Scholar) programs, respectively. Bootstrap analyses were used to assess the confidence level of each node with 100 replications for the Maximum-Likelihood method and 1000 replications for the Neighbor-Joining method. Protein and nucleic acid sequences from 40 different S. cerevisiae strains were obtained from the Saccharomyces Genome Database. Nucleic acid sequences were aligned based on the protein sequence alignments using the TRANalign program (available in the EMBOSS package). The dN/dS ratios were calculated based on these nucleic acid sequence alignments using CODEML in PAMLX (28Xu B. Yang Z. PAMLX: a graphical user interface for PAML.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2013; 30: 2723-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) for the DLD1, DLD2, and DLD3 genes. Briefly, for each gene, Neighbor-Joining trees were constructed using ClustalX. Those trees were then used for dN and dS calculations based on a neutral model. The S. cerevisiae strains used in this study (supplemental Table S1), all isogenic to the reference BY4741 or BY4742 strains, were either taken from the collection of non-essential gene deletion mutants (dld2Î and dld3Î mutants) or generated via PCR-mediated gene replacement (dld1Î, ser3Î, and ser33Î mutants) (29Brachmann C.B.

Designer deletion strains derived from Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C: a useful set of strains and plasmids for PCR-mediated gene disruption and other applications.Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2612) Google Scholar). For gene replacement with the KanMX cassette, primer pairs binding 200â300 bp upstream and 150â350 bp downstream of the ORF of interest were designed (supplemental Table S2). Genomic DNA of the corresponding knock-out strain from the yeast deletion collection served as a template for PCR amplification. The PCR was performed using Phusion DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in the buffer provided by the manufacturer (Phusion HF Buffer) as follows: (i) denaturation for 10 min at 98 Â°C; (ii) 35 cycles of denaturation (30 s at 98 Â°C), annealing (30 s at 48 Â°C for dld1Î or 53 Â°C for ser3Î and ser33Î), and elongation for 2 min at 72 Â°C; and (iii) final elongation for 10 min at 72 Â°C. The PCR products were purified and transformed into wild-type strains of both mating types (BY4741 and BY4742). Transformants were selected after 2â3 days at 30 Â°C on YPD plates containing 200 Î¼g/ml of the aminoglycoside antibiotic G418. The double knock-out strain ser3Îser33Î was generated by mating haploid single mutant cells of opposing mating types, followed by sporulation on agar plates containing potassium acetate (10 g/liter) and tetrad dissection. All the gene deletions in the knock-out strains used in this study were confirmed by PCR analysis and Sanger sequencing (Eurofins Genomics). To generate overexpression and rescue strains, the Gateway Cloning technology was used. For each gene to overexpress (SER3, SER33) or to rescue (DLD3), Entry clones were generated in a BP reaction between the attB-flanked ORFs of interest (PCR-amplified from wild-type BY4741 genomic DNA) and the pDONR221 vector (Invitrogen) according to Ref. 30Alberti S. Gitler A.D. Lindquist S. A suite of Gateway cloning vectors for high-throughput genetic analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Yeast. 2007; 24: 913-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar. The sequences of the PCR primers used and the plasmids obtained are given in supplemental Tables S2 and S3. The inserts were then subcloned from the sequence-verified Entry clones into the pAG416-GPD-ccdB Destination vector (Addgene ID 14148; yeast centromere plasmid containing a constitutive glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter and the URA3 gene for nutrient selection) in LR reactions to create the desired Expression clones (supplemental Table S3). The purified expression plasmids were transformed into yeast strains with different genetic backgrounds using the EZ-YEASTTM transformation kit (MP Biomedicals) (supplemental Table S1). Yeast strains were grown in filter-sterilized minimal defined medium (6.7 g/liter Yeast Nitrogen Base from MP Biomedicals, 10 g/liter d-glucose, 80 mg/liter uracil, 80 mg/liter l-methionine, 80 mg/liter l-histidine, and 240 mg/liter l-leucine), if not otherwise indicated. The pH was adjusted to 5.5 by addition of sodium hydroxide. Batch cultures were shaken in flasks at 200 rpm and 30 Â°C, with a working volume corresponding to 10% of the volume of the Erlenmeyer flasks. Liquid batch cultures were started by inoculation with glycerol stocks (0.05â0.1% of the final cultivation volume) that were prepared as follows: liquid yeast cultures (100 ml) were inoculated from single colonies and grown for at least 18 h in minimal defined medium, concentrated 10-fold by centrifugation, enriched with glycerol to a final concentration of 20% (v/v), and stored at â80 Â°C until further use. To monitor the growth of yeast cultures, biovolume and cell concentration were determined in aliquots taken from the yeast cultivations using a Multisizer Z3 equipped with a 30-Î¼m measurement capillary (Beckman Coulter) after dilution in ISOTON II solution (Beckman Coulter). 10-ml aliquots of yeast cultivations were quenched by adding 30 ml of 60% (v/v) methanol at â60 Â°C. This mixture was shaken by tube inversion, and cells were pelleted by a 10-min centrifugation at 10,000 Ã g and â10 Â°C. Pellets were stored at â80 Â°C until further processing. Intracellular metabolites were extracted from the frozen cell pellets (of known biovolume) by addition of a 55.5-fold volume of extraction fluid (50% methanol, 50% TE buffer at pH 7.0 containing 10 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm EDTA) at â20 Â°C and an equal volume of chloroform at â20 Â°C. The mixture was incubated at â20 Â°C in a shaking device (Vortexer or Eppendorf shaker) for 2 h and then centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 Ã g and â10 Â°C. The upper aqueous phase was taken up, filtered (0.22 Î¼m, cellulose acetate membrane) into an HPLC glass vial, and stored at â20 Â°C until LC-MS analysis. For the analysis of extracellular metabolites, 0.5â2-ml aliquots of the yeast cultivations were filtered on 0.22-Î¼m cellulose acetate membranes and stored at â20 Â°C until further processing. Two different types of LC-MS analyses were performed. To differentially quantify d- and l-2-hydroxyglutarate in our samples, a first method was adapted from a previously published MRM-based LC-MS/MS method that allows separation of both 2HG enantiomers by reverse-phase HPLC (3Struys E.A. Jansen E.E. Verhoeven N.M. Jakobs C. Measurement of urinary d- and l-2-hydroxyglutarate enantiomers by stable-isotope-dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry after derivatization with diacetyl-l-tartaric anhydride.Clin. Chem. 2004; 50: 1391-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Deuterated 2HG, prepared by reduction of [3,3,4,4-2H4]Î±-ketoglutaric acid as described previously (2Gibson K.M. ten Brink H.J.

Stable-isotope dilution analysis of d- and l-2-hydroxyglutaric acid: application to the detection and prenatal diagnosis of d- and l-2-hydroxyglutaric acidemias.Pediatr. Res. 1993; 34: 277-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), was added as an internal standard (10 nmol) to the cell extracts, prepared as described above. Samples were dried in a CentriVap Vacuum Concentrator (LabConco) at â4 Â°C and resuspended in 50 Î¼l of dichloromethane/acetic acid (4:1, v/v) containing 50 mg/ml of the derivatizing chiral compound diacetyl-l-tartaric anhydride. The samples were heated for 30 min at 75 Â°C, dried down again in the vacuum concentrator at ambient temperature, and resuspended in 500 Î¼l of water. HPLC separation was performed on an Agilent 1260SL instrument using an Agilent Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (150 Ã 2.1 mm, 2.7 Î¼m particle size) with an isocratic flow (0.25 ml/min) of a mobile phase composed of 90% aqueous ammonium acetate (5 mm) containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and 10% acetonitrile. The temperature was kept constant at 30 Â°C. The target compounds were detected on an ABSciex 4500 QTRAP mass spectrometer in negative MRM mode. Detection and quantification were based on the peak areas of specific MRM transitions (2HG, 363 > 147 m/z; [2H4]2HG, 367 > 151 m/z) and one transition was used for confirmation of the 2HG isomers (363 > 129 m/z). The l- and d-2HG derivatives eluted at a retention time of 1.84 and 2.03 min, respectively. A second targeted LC-MS method was used for the quantification of a range of physiological organic acids (including total 2HG) and all 20 amino acids (supplemental Table S4). For this analysis, samples were not derivatized, and hence the l and d enantiomers of 2HG were not separated during liquid chromatography. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Dionex UltiMate 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with a HESI electrospray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Nitrogen was supplied by a Genius 1022 high purity generator (Peak Scientific Instruments, Ltd.). A ZicHILIC SeQuant column (150 Ã 2.1 mm, 3.5 Î¼m particle size, 100 â« pore size) connected to a ZicHILIC guard column (20 Ã 2.1 mm, 5 Î¼m particle size) (Merck KgAA) was used for separation. LC was performed at 15 Â°C and a constant flow of 0.4 ml/min in gradient mode. Using buffers A (water/acetonitrile/formic acid, 99:1:0.1 by volume) and B (acetonitrile/water/formic acid, 99:1:0.1 by volume), a 25-min chromatographic gradient was applied. An isocratic step at 95% B for 2.7 min was followed by a progressive decrease to 93% B over 3.3 min, 90% B over 3 min, 80% B over 4 min, 50% B over 7 min, and a final decrease to 10% B over 1 additional min. The gradient was followed by an isocratic step at 10% B for 2 min, before the initial conditions were restored within 0.1 min and kept constant for additional 1.9 min. Mass spectral data were obtained in positive and negative electrospray ionization modes via scheduled selected ion monitoring. The sheath gas flow rate was set to 10, the spray voltage to 4 kV and the capillary temperature to 320 Â°C. Intra- and extracellular concentrations were determined using external calibration curves ranging from 0.01 to 50 Î¼m for each metabolite. Extracellular glucose levels were measured using a YSI 2950D (Yellow Springs Instruments) biochemistry analyzer. l- and d-lactate concentrations in culture media and in transhydrogenase activity assays (see below) were measured spectrophotometrically (TECAN M200 Pro) at 30 Â°C by determining the change of absorbance due to NADH formation at 340 nm after addition of either l-LDH (from rabbit muscle, Sigma) or d-LDH (from Lactobacillus leichmannii, Sigma). The assay mixture (200 Î¼l total volume) contained a glycine/hydrazine buffer at pH 9.5 (100 mm glycine, 40 mm hydrazine sulfate), 3 mm NAD+, and l-LDH (4 units) or d-LDH (6.6 units for the transhydrogenase assays and 10 units for extracellular d-lactate measurements). Sequence-verified Gateway Entry clones containing the ORFs of the DLD2, DLD3, SER3, and SER33 genes were generated as described above. For Dld2, the 44 N-terminal amino acids of the coding sequence (mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS)) were omitted for plasmid construction. All inserts were subcloned into the Destination Vector pDest-527 (Addgene ID 11518; isopropyl 1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside-inducible T7 promoter, N-terminal His6 tag). The resulting Expression clones were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells for protein overexpression (supplemental Tables S1 and S3). Precultures of transformed E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were inoculated (at a 1:50 ratio) into 500â1000 ml of LB medium containing 100 Î¼g/ml ampicillin and cultivated at 37 Â°C with shaking until the optical density measured at 600 nm (Biochrom WPA CO8000 Cell density meter) reached 0.5â1.0. Cultures were then put on ice for 30 min and induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm for Dld3 and 0.1 mm for Dld2, Ser3, and Ser33 production. The induced cultures were left with shaking for 16â21 h at 18 Â°C, and cells were harvested by a 15-min centrifugation at 4500 Ã g and 4 Â°C. The pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, 1Ã EDTA-free Complete Ultra protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science) in a volume corresponding to 5% of the original culture volume. Cell suspensions were sonicated for 2 min at an amplitude of 25â30% with 0.5-s pulses separated by 1â2.5-s breaks to minimize sample heat-up, and then centrifuged for 35 min at 17,000 Ã g and 4 Â°C to separate cell debris from the soluble protein fraction. Protein purifications and protein desalting were conducted at 4 Â°C on an ÃKTA protein purifier (GE Healthcare). Cleared cell lysates were filtered on cellulose acetate membranes (0.45- or 1.2-Î¼m pore size, Minisart), and buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole) was added to the filtrate to reach a final imidazole concentration of 10 mm. The latter preparation was loaded onto a 1-ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare), which was th"

https://openalex.org/W2247437174,"The determination of the molecular mechanism underlying retinal pathogenesis and visual dysfunction during innate inflammation, and the treatment effect of rapamycin thereon.The endotoxin-induced uveitis and retinitis mouse model was established by injecting lipopolysaccharide. The mice were subsequently treated with rapamycin, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor. The rhodopsin mRNA and protein expression level in the retina and the photoreceptor outer segment (OS) length in immunohistochemical stainings were measured, and visual function was recorded by electroretinography. Inflammatory cytokines, their related molecules, mTOR, and LC3 levels were measured by real-time PCR and/or immunoblotting. Leukocyte adhesion during inflammation was analyzed using concanavalin A lectin.The post-transcriptional reduction in the visual pigment of rod photoreceptor cells, rhodopsin, OS shortening, and rod photoreceptor cell dysfunction during inflammation were suppressed by rapamycin. Activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-ÎºB) and induction of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and the activation of the downstream signaling protein, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which reduces rhodopsin in the retina during inflammation, were attenuated by rapamycin. Increased leukocyte adhesion was also attenuated by rapamycin. Interestingly, although mTOR activation was observed after NF-ÎºB activation, mTOR inhibition suppressed NF-ÎºB activation at the early phase, indicating that the basal level of activated mTOR was sufficient to activate NF-ÎºB in the retina. In addition, the inhibition of NF-ÎºB suppressed mTOR activation, suggesting a positive feedback loop of mTOR and NF-ÎºB during inflammation. The ratio of LC3II to LC3I, which reflects autophagy induction, was not changed by inflammation but was increased by rapamycin.Our results propose the potential use of rapamycin as a neuroprotective therapy to suppress local activated mTOR levels, related inflammatory molecules, and the subsequent visual dysfunction during retinal inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2259660919,"Haifan Lin, Jamy Peng and colleagues report that the Drosophila Piwi protein is a negative regulator of PRC2 in the fly ovary, a function required for the maintenance of germline stem cells. Their results indicate that Piwi sequesters PRC2 in the nucleoplasm, thereby reducing genome-wide levels of H3K27me3. The Drosophila melanogaster Piwi protein regulates both niche and intrinsic mechanisms to maintain germline stem cells, but its underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here we report that Piwi interacts with Polycomb group complexes PRC1 and PRC2 in niche and germline cells to regulate ovarian germline stem cells and oogenesis. Piwi physically interacts with the PRC2 subunits Su(z)12 and Esc in the ovary and in vitro. Chromatin coimmunoprecipitation of Piwi, the PRC2 enzymatic subunit E(z), histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and RNA polymerase II in wild-type and piwi mutant ovaries demonstrates that Piwi binds a conserved DNA motif at â¼72 genomic sites and inhibits PRC2 binding to many non-Piwi-binding genomic targets and H3K27 trimethylation. Moreover, Piwi influences RNA polymerase II activities in Drosophila ovaries, likely via inhibiting PRC2. We hypothesize that Piwi negatively regulates PRC2 binding by sequestering PRC2 in the nucleoplasm, thus reducing PRC2 binding to many targets and influencing transcription during oogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2406958043,"Constitutive activation of the antiapoptotic nuclear factor-ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) signaling pathway is a hallmark of the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Recurrent oncogenic mutations are found in the scaffold protein CARMA1 (CARD11) that connects B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling to the canonical NF-ÎºB pathway. We asked how far additional downstream processes are activated and contribute to the oncogenic potential of DLBCL-derived CARMA1 mutants. To this end, we expressed oncogenic CARMA1 in the NF-ÎºB negative DLBCL lymphoma cell line BJAB. By a proteomic approach we identified recruitment of Î²-catenin and its destruction complex consisting of APC, AXIN1, CK1Î± and GSK3Î² to oncogenic CARMA1. Recruitment of the Î²-catenin destruction complex was independent of CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 complex formation or constitutive NF-ÎºB activation and promoted the stabilization of Î²-catenin. The Î²-catenin destruction complex was also recruited to CARMA1 in ABC DLBCL cell lines, which coincided with elevated Î²-catenin expression. In line, Î²-catenin was frequently detected in non-GCB DLBCL biopsies that rely on chronic BCR signaling. Increased Î²-catenin amounts alone were not sufficient to induce classical WNT target gene signatures, but could augment TCF/LEF-dependent transcriptional activation in response to WNT signaling. In conjunction with NF-ÎºB, Î²-catenin enhanced expression of immunosuppressive interleukin-10 and suppressed antitumoral CCL3, indicating that Î²-catenin can induce a favorable tumor microenvironment. Thus, parallel activation of NF-ÎºB and Î²-catenin signaling by gain-of-function mutations in CARMA1 augments WNT stimulation and is required for regulating the expression of distinct NF-ÎºB target genes to trigger cell-intrinsic and extrinsic processes that promote DLBCL lymphomagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2235924330,"Synaptic maintenance is essential for neural circuit function. In the C. elegans locomotor circuit, motor neurons are in direct contact with the epidermis. Here, we reveal a novel epidermal-neuronal interaction mediated by a two-immunoglobulin domain transmembrane protein, ZIG-10, that is necessary for maintaining cholinergic synapse density. ZIG-10 is localized at the cell surface of epidermis and cholinergic motor neurons, with high levels at areas adjacent to synapses. Loss of zig-10 increases the number of cholinergic excitatory synapses and exacerbates convulsion behavior in a seizure model. Mis-expression of zig-10 in GABAergic inhibitory neurons reduces GABAergic synapse number, dependent on the presence of ZIG-10 in the epidermis. Furthermore, ZIG-10 interacts with the tyrosine kinase SRC-2 to regulate the phagocytic activity of the epidermis to restrict cholinergic synapse number. Our studies demonstrate the highly specific roles of non-neuronal cells in modulating neural circuit function, through neuron-type-specific maintenance of synapse density."

However, the prognosis after registration and the circumstances of lung transplantation with sirolimus therapy have never been reported.In this national survey, we analyzed data from 98 LAM patients registered for lung transplantation in the Japan Organ Transplantation Network.Transplantation was performed in 57 patients as of March 2014. Survival rate was 86.7% at 1 year, 82.5% at 3 years, 73.7% at 5 years, and 73.7% at 10 years. Of the 98 patients, 21 had an inactive status and received sirolimus more frequently than those with an active history (67% vs. 5%, p<0.001). Nine of twelve patients who remained inactive as of March 2014 initiated sirolimus before or while on a waiting list, and remained on sirolimus thereafter. Although the statistical analysis showed no statistically significant difference, the survival rate after registration tended to be better for lung transplant recipients than for those who awaited transplantation (p = 0.053).Lung transplantation is a satisfactory therapeutic option for advanced LAM, but the circumstances for pre-transplantation LAM patients are likely to alter with the use of sirolimus."
https://openalex.org/W2238670492,"The majority of printing inks are based on mineral oils (MOs) which contain complex mixtures of saturated and aromatic hydrocarbons. Consumer exposure to these oils occurs either through direct skin contacts or, more frequently, as a result of MO migration into the contents of food packaging that was made from recycled newspaper. Despite this ubiquitous and frequent exposure little is known about the potential toxicological effects, particularly with regard to the aromatic MO fractions. From a toxicological point of view the huge amount of alkylated and unsubstituted compounds therein is reason for concern as they can harbor genotoxicants as well as potential endocrine disruptors. The aim of this study was to assess both the genotoxic and estrogenic potential of MOs used in printing inks. Mineral oils with various aromatic hydrocarbon contents were tested using a battery of in vitro assays selected to address various endpoints such as estrogen-dependent cell proliferation, activation of estrogen receptor Î± or transcriptional induction of estrogenic target genes. In addition, the comet assay has been applied to test for genotoxicity. Out of 15 MOs tested, 10 were found to potentially act as xenoestrogens. For most of the oils the effects were clearly triggered by constituents of the aromatic hydrocarbon fraction. From 5 oils tested in the comet assay, 2 showed slight genotoxicity. Altogether it appears that MOs used in printing inks are potential endocrine disruptors and should thus be assessed carefully to what extent they might contribute to the total estrogenic burden in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2274395004,"Non-small-cell lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and is comprised of several histological subtypes, the two most common being adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Targeted therapies have successfully improved response rates in patients with AC tumors. However, the majority of SCC tumors lack specific targetable mutations, making development of new treatment paradigms for this disease challenging. In the present study, we used iterative non-negative matrix factorization, an unbiased clustering method, on mRNA expression data from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) and a panel of 24 SCC cell lines to classify three disease segments within SCC. Analysis of gene set enrichment and drug sensitivity identified an immune-evasion subtype that showed increased sensitivity to nuclear factor-ÎºB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibition, a replication-stress associated subtype that showed increased sensitivity to ataxia telangiectasia inhibition, and a neuroendocrine-associated subtype that showed increased sensitivity to phosphoinositide 3-kinase and fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibition. Additionally, each of these subtypes exhibited a unique microRNA expression profile. Focusing on the immune-evasion subtype, bioinformatic analysis of microRNA promoters revealed enrichment for binding sites for the MAPK-driven ETS1 transcription factor. Indeed, we found that knockdown of ETS1 led to upregulation of eight microRNAs and downregulation of miR-29b in the immune-evasion subtype. Mechanistically, we found that miR-29b targets the DNA-demethylating enzyme, TET1, for downregulation resulting in decreased 5-hmC epigenetic modifications. Moreover, inhibition of MAPK signaling by gefitinib led to decreased ETS1 and miR-29b expression with a corresponding increase in TET1 expression and increase in 5-hmC. Collectively, our work identifies three subtypes of lung SCC that differ in drug sensitivity and shows a novel mechanism of miR-29b regulation by MAPK-driven ETS1 expression which leads to downstream changes in TET1-mediated epigenetic modifications."
https://openalex.org/W2260677893,"Multipass membrane proteins perform critical signal transduction and transport across membranes. How transmembrane helix (TMH) sequences encode the topology and conformational flexibility regulating these functions remains poorly understood. Here we describe a comprehensive analysis of the sequence-structure relationships at multiple interacting TMHs from all membrane proteins with structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). We found that membrane proteins can be deconstructed in interacting TMH trimer units, which mostly fold into six distinct structural classes of topologies and conformations. Each class is enriched in recurrent sequence motifs from functionally unrelated proteins, revealing unforeseen consensus and evolutionary conserved networks of stabilizing interhelical contacts. Interacting TMHs' topology and local protein conformational flexibility were remarkably well predicted in a blinded fashion from the identified binding-hotspot motifs. Our results reveal universal sequence-structure principles governing the complex anatomy and plasticity of multipass membrane proteins that may guide de novo structure prediction, design, and studies of folding and dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2406620287,"Retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARÎ±) has a critical role in the differentiation process of osteosarcoma cells induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). However, degradation of RARÎ± through ubiquitin proteasome pathway weakens the differentiation efficiency of osteosarcoma cells. In this study, we discover that murine double minute-2 (MDM2) acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to target RARÎ± for degradation. We observe that MDM2 is required for RARÎ± polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation because downregulation of MDM2 by short hairpin RNA results in the accumulation of RARÎ±, and MDM2 overexpression promotes the degradation of RARÎ±. We also demonstrate that the N-terminal domain of MDM2 (amino acids 1â109) is the major RARÎ±-binding site. Importantly, endogenous MDM2 levels are not only upregulated in human primary osteosarcoma blasts but are also inversely correlated with the level of osteopontin, which is a marker of bone differentiation. Moreover, MDM2 impairs the ATRA-induced osteoblastic differentiation of osteosarcoma cells, whereas an inhibitor of the MDM2 ubiquitin ligase synergizes with ATRA to enhance the differentiation of osteosarcoma cells and primary osteosarcoma blasts. Therefore, our study indicates that MDM2 serves as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to regulate the degradation of RARÎ± and suggests that MDM2 is a novel therapeutic target for ATRA-based differentiation therapeutic approaches in osteosarcoma."
https://openalex.org/W2253307524,"The establishment of cell polarity is an essential process for the development of multicellular organisms and the functioning of cells and tissues. Here, we combine large-scale protein interaction mapping with systematic phenotypic profiling to study the network of physical interactions that underlies polarity establishment and maintenance in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Using a fragment-based yeast two-hybrid strategy, we identified 439 interactions between 296 proteins, as well as the protein regions that mediate these interactions. Phenotypic profiling of the network resulted in the identification of 100 physically interacting protein pairs for which RNAi-mediated depletion caused a defect in the same polarity-related process. We demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the network by showing that the physical interaction between the RhoGAP PAC-1 and PAR-6 is required for radial polarization of the C. elegans embryo. Our network represents a valuable resource of candidate interactions that can be used to further our insight into cell polarization. Boxem and colleagues perform a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify interactions between C. elegans polarity genes, followed by an RNAi screen to identify the functions of interaction pairs in the establishment and maintenance of cell polarity in various tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2267140735,"Genome-wide chromatin studies identified the tumor suppressor p53 as both a promoter and an enhancer-binding transcription factor. As an enhancer factor, p53 can induce local production of enhancer RNAs, as well as transcriptional activation of distal neighboring genes. Beyond the regulation of protein-coding genes, p53 has the capacity to regulate long intergenic noncoding RNA molecules (lincRNAs); however, their importance to the p53 tumor suppressive function remains poorly characterized. Here, we identified and characterized a novel p53-bound intronic enhancer that controls the expression of its host, the lincRNA00475 (linc-475). We demonstrate the requirement of linc-475 for the proper induction of a p53-dependent cell cycle inhibitory response. We further confirm the functional importance of linc-475 in the maintenance of CDKN1A/p21 levels, a cell cycle inhibitor and a major p53 target gene, following p53 activation. Interestingly, loss of linc-475 reduced the binding of both p53 and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to the promoter of p21, attenuating its transcription rate following p53 activation. Altogether, our data suggest a direct role of p53-bound enhancer domains in the activation of lincRNAs required for an efficient p53 transcriptional response."
https://openalex.org/W2295700594,"Fatty acid kinase (Fak) is a ubiquitous Gram-positive bacterial enzyme consisting of an ATP-binding protein (FakA) that phosphorylates the fatty acid bound to FakB. In Staphylococcus aureus, Fak is a global regulator of virulence factor transcription and is essential for the activation of exogenous fatty acids for incorporation into phospholipids. The 1.2-A x-ray structure of S. aureus FakB2, activity assays, solution studies, site-directed mutagenesis, and in vivo complementation were used to define the functions of the five conserved residues that define the FakB protein family (Pfam02645). The fatty acid tail is buried within the protein, and the exposed carboxyl group is bound by a Ser-93-fatty acid carboxyl-Thr-61-His-266 hydrogen bond network. The guanidinium of the invariant Arg-170 is positioned to potentially interact with a bound acylphosphate. The reduced thermal denaturation temperatures of the T61A, S93A, and H266A FakB2 mutants illustrate the importance of the hydrogen bond network in protein stability. The FakB2 T61A, S93A, and H266A mutants are 1000-fold less active in the Fak assay, and the R170A mutant is completely inactive. All FakB2 mutants form FakA(FakB2)2 complexes except FakB2(R202A), which is deficient in FakA binding. Allelic replacement shows that strains expressing FakB2 mutants are defective in fatty acid incorporation into phospholipids and virulence gene transcription. These conserved residues are likely to perform the same critical functions in all bacterial fatty acid-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2233316906,"Pheromones are an important component of sexual communication in courting salamanders, but the number of species in which their use has been demonstrated with behavioral evidence remains limited. Here we developed a behavioral assay for demonstrating courtship pheromone use in the aquatically courting Iberian ribbed newt Pleurodeles waltl. By performing an in-depth study of the courtship behavior, we show that females invariably open their cloaca (cloacal gaping) before engaging in pinwheel behavior, the circling movement that is the prelude to spermatophore uptake. In contrast, cloacal gaping was not observed in failed courtships, where females escaped or displayed thanatosis. Since gaping mainly occurred during male amplexus and cloacal imposition, which is the obvious period of pheromone transfer, we next investigated whether male courtship water (i.e., water holding courtship pheromones) alone was able to induce this reaction in females. These tests showed that courtship water induced cloacal gaping significantly more than water, even in the absence of a male. Cloacal gaping thus provides a simple and robust test for demonstrating courtship pheromone use in the Iberian ribbed newt. Since opening the cloaca is an essential prerequisite for spermatophore pick-up in all internally fertilizing salamanders, we hypothesize that variations on this assay will also be useful in several other species."
https://openalex.org/W2237126255,"Cell cycle ends with cytokinesis that is the physical separation of a cell into two daughter cells. For faithful cytokinesis, cells integrate multiple processes, such as actomyosin ring formation, contraction and plasma membrane closure, into coherent responses. Linear actin assembly by formins is essential for formation and maintenance of actomyosin ring. Although budding yeast's two formins, Bni1 and Bnr1, are known to switch their subcellular localization at the division site prior to cytokinesis, the underlying mechanisms were not completely understood. Here, we provide evidence showing that Bnr1 is dephosphorylated concomitant with its release from the division site. Impaired PP1/Glc7 activity delayed Bnr1 release and dephosphorylation, Bni1 recruitment and actomyosin ring formation at the division site. These results suggest the involvement of Glc7 in this regulation. Further, we identified Ref2 as the PP1 regulatory subunit responsible for this regulation. Taken together, Glc7 and Ref2 may have a role in actomyosin ring formation by modulating the localization of formins during cytokinesis."
https://openalex.org/W2339508778,"Fungal electron transport systems (ETS) are branched, involving alternative NADH dehydrogenases and an alternative terminal oxidase. These alternative respiratory enzymes were reported to play a role in pathogenesis, production of antibiotics and excretion of organic acids. The activity of these alternative respiratory enzymes strongly depends on environmental conditions. Functional analysis of fungal ETS under highly standardised conditions for cultivation, sample processing and respirometric assay are still lacking. We developed a highly standardised protocol to explore in vivo the ETS-and in particular the alternative oxidase-in Penicillium ochrochloron. This included cultivation in glucose-limited chemostat (to achieve a defined and reproducible physiological state), direct transfer without any manipulation of a broth sample to the respirometer (to maintain the physiological state in the respirometer as close as possible to that in the chemostat), and high-resolution respirometry (small sample volume and high measuring accuracy). This protocol was aimed at avoiding any changes in the physiological phenotype due to the high phenotypic plasticity of filamentous fungi. A stable oxygen consumption (< 5% change in 20 minutes) was only possible with glucose limited chemostat mycelium and a direct transfer of a broth sample into the respirometer. Steady state respiration was 29% below its maximum respiratory capacity. Additionally to a rotenone-sensitive complex I and most probably a functioning complex III, the ETS of P. ochrochloron also contained a cyanide-sensitive terminal oxidase (complex IV). Activity of alternative oxidase was present constitutively. The degree of inhibition strongly depended on the sequence of inhibitor addition. This suggested, as postulated for plants, that the alternative terminal oxidase was in dynamic equilibrium with complex IV-independent of the rate of electron flux. This means that the onset of activity does not depend on a complete saturation or inhibition of the cytochrome pathway."
