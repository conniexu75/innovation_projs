Little is known about how plants sense changes in soil nutrient concentrations. Previous studies showed that T101-phosphorylated CHL1 is a high-affinity nitrate transporter, whereas T101-dephosphorylated CHL1 is a low-affinity transporter. In this study, analysis of an uptake- and sensing-decoupled mutant showed that the nitrate transporter CHL1 functions as a nitrate sensor. Primary nitrate responses in CHL1T101D and CHLT101A transgenic plants showed that phosphorylated and dephosphorylated CHL1 lead to a low- and high-level response, respectively. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that, in response to low nitrate concentrations, protein kinase CIPK23 can phosphorylate T101 of CHL1 to maintain a low-level primary response. Thus, CHL1 uses dual-affinity binding and a phosphorylation switch to sense a wide range of nitrate concentrations in the soil, thereby functioning as an ion sensor in higher plants.For a video summary of this article, see the PaperFlick file with the Supplemental Data available online."
https://openalex.org/W2010790480,"Polycomb group proteins have an essential role in the epigenetic maintenance of repressive chromatin states. The gene-silencing activity of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) depends on its ability to trimethylate lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) by the catalytic SET domain of the EZH2 subunit, and at least two other subunits of the complex: SUZ12 and EED. Here we show that the carboxy-terminal domain of EED specifically binds to histone tails carrying trimethyl-lysine residues associated with repressive chromatin marks, and that this leads to the allosteric activation of the methyltransferase activity of PRC2. Mutations in EED that prevent it from recognizing repressive trimethyl-lysine marks abolish the activation of PRC2 in vitro and, in Drosophila, reduce global methylation and disrupt development. These findings suggest a model for the propagation of the H3K27me3 mark that accounts for the maintenance of repressive chromatin domains and for the transmission of a histone modification from mother to daughter cells."
https://openalex.org/W2153051750,"Stem-like cells may be integral to the development and maintenance of human cancers. Direct proof is still lacking, mainly because of our poor understanding of the biological differences between normal and cancer stem cells (SCs). Using the ErbB2 transgenic model of breast cancer, we found that self-renewing divisions of cancer SCs are more frequent than their normal counterparts, unlimited and symmetric, thus contributing to increasing numbers of SCs in tumoral tissues. SCs with targeted mutation of the tumor suppressor p53 possess the same self-renewal properties as cancer SCs, and their number increases progressively in the p53 null premalignant mammary gland. Pharmacological reactivation of p53 correlates with restoration of asymmetric divisions in cancer SCs and tumor growth reduction, without significant effects on additional cancer cells. These data demonstrate that p53 regulates polarity of cell division in mammary SCs and suggest that loss of p53 favors symmetric divisions of cancer SCs, contributing to tumor growth."
https://openalex.org/W1987284219,"After complete spinal cord transections that removed all supraspinal inputs in adult rats, combinations of serotonergic agonists and epidural electrical stimulation were able to acutely transform spinal networks from nonfunctional to highly functional and adaptive states as early as 1 week after injury. Using kinematics, physiological and anatomical analyses, we found that these interventions could recruit specific populations of spinal circuits, refine their control via sensory input and functionally remodel these locomotor pathways when combined with training. The emergence of these new functional states enabled full weight-bearing treadmill locomotion in paralyzed rats that was almost indistinguishable from voluntary stepping. We propose that, in the absence of supraspinal input, spinal locomotion can emerge from a combination of central pattern-generating capability and the ability of these spinal circuits to use sensory afferent input to control stepping. These findings provide a strategy by which individuals with spinal cord injuries could regain substantial levels of motor control."
https://openalex.org/W2135456872,"Prostate cancer (PrCa) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in males in developed countries. To identify common PrCa susceptibility alleles, we previously conducted a genome-wide association study in which 541,129 SNPs were genotyped in 1,854 PrCa cases with clinically detected disease and in 1,894 controls. We have now extended the study to evaluate promising associations in a second stage in which we genotyped 43,671 SNPs in 3,650 PrCa cases and 3,940 controls and in a third stage involving an additional 16,229 cases and 14,821 controls from 21 studies. In addition to replicating previous associations, we identified seven new prostate cancer susceptibility loci on chromosomes 2, 4, 8, 11 and 22 (with P = 1.6 x 10(-8) to P = 2.7 x 10(-33))."
https://openalex.org/W2154333461,"Two decades of research identified more than a dozen clock genes and defined a biochemical feedback mechanism of circadian oscillator function. To identify additional clock genes and modifiers, we conducted a genome-wide small interfering RNA screen in a human cellular clock model. Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. Potent effects on period length or increased amplitude were less frequent; we found hundreds of these and confirmed them in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on oscillator function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of insulin and hedgehog signaling, the cell cycle, and the folate metabolism. Coupled with data showing many of these pathways are clock regulated, we conclude the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

Circadian rhythms in mammals are exemplified by the sleep/wake cycle and regulated by an internal timing system. A central clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus coordinates input and, through a complex signaling cascade, synchronizes local clocks in the brain and throughout the body (Reppert and Weaver, 2002Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Coordination of circadian timing in mammals.Nature. 2002; 418: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (3134) Google Scholar, Panda et al., 2002bPanda S. Hogenesch J.B. Kay S.A.

Mammalian circadian signaling networks and therapeutic targets.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 631-639Google Scholar). Over the past two decades, extensive genetic, genomic, molecular, and cell biological approaches identified more than a dozen clock genes that collectively comprise a biochemical feedback loop that drives circadian oscillations (Reppert and Weaver, 2002Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Coordination of circadian timing in mammals.Nature. 2002; 418: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (3134) Google Scholar, Panda et al., 2002bPanda S. Hogenesch J.B. Kay S.A. Circadian rhythms from flies to human.Nature. 2002; 417: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Recent models consider the clock a biochemical and cellular oscillator, and also a genetic network. A highly conserved negative feedback loop was discovered and elucidated at biochemical, cellular, and organismal levels in mammals and Drosophila; transcription factors play a prominent role in the clock mechanism. The bHLH-PAS transcriptional activators BMAL1 (official name: ARNTL, an ortholog of the Drosophila cyc gene) and its heterodimeric partner CLOCK (an ortholog of the Drosophila Clk gene) interact to bind to E-box cis elements present in the promoter regions of their target genes. These targets include two families of repressor proteins, the PERIODs (PER1, PER2, and PER3) and the CRYPTOCHROMEs (CRY1 and CRY2), which interact in a protein complex that translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. In the nucleus, this repressor complex physically associates with the BMAL1-CLOCK complex to inhibit E-box-mediated transcription. This process results in the cyclic transcription of these repressor genes, as well as thousands of transcriptional output genes elsewhere in the genome (Hughes et al., 2009Hughes M.E. DiTacchio L.

In addition to rhythmic transcription, PER and CRY protein levels and subcellular localization also oscillate. Protein level cycling is a consequence of the transcriptional regulation mentioned above, but also through posttranscriptional and posttranslational mechanisms that regulate the stability and degradation of messages and proteins. These processes are mediated by kinases (e.g., CSNK1D, CSNK1E, CSNK2, and GSK3B) (Vanselow et al., 2006Vanselow K. Vanselow J.T. Westermark P.O. Reischl S. Maier B. Korte T. Herrmann A. Herzel H.

Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY. Importantly, these additional regulatory steps introduce a delay, critical for rhythm generation and period regulation, in the clock mechanism (Gallego and Virshup, 2007Gallego M. Virshup D.M. Post-translational modifications relgulate the ticking of the circadian clock.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The circadian oscillator is also a highly interconnected genetic network that uses other transcription factors and response elements. In addition to the biochemical feedback loop that regulates cycling at the E-box (termed the “core loop”), circadian gene expression is mediated by transcription at the ROR/REV-ERB (RORE) and the DBP/E4BP4 (D-box) binding elements. Two subfamilies of nuclear hormone receptors, the NR1Ds (NR1D1 and NR1D2, or REV-ERBα and β) and RORs (α, β and γ, or RORa, RORb and RORc), either repress or activate gene transcription from the ROR elements in several clock genes (Ukai-Tadenuma et al., 2008Ukai-Tadenuma M. Kasukawa T. Ueda H.R. Proof-by-synthesis of the transcriptional logic of mammalian circadian clocks.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1154-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The bZIP transcription factors, DBP, TEF, and HLF, perform similar functions on the D-box element (Gachon et al., 2006Gachon F. Fleury-Olela F. Schaad O. Descombes P. Schibler U.

The role of these genes was examined in vivo and in vitro. Knockout mice for Rev-erbα, Rorα, or Rorβ, have lower amplitude rhythms, abnormal period lengths, and interindividual variability in both phenotypes (Andre et al., 1998Andre E. Conquet F. Steinmayr M. Stratton S.C. Porciatti V. Becker-Andre M.

A functional genomics strategy reveals Rora as a component of the mammalian circadian clock.Neuron. 2004; 43: 527-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). A coactivator shown to interact with the ROR proteins, PGC1α, modulates Bmal1 expression, and Pgc1α knockout mice display long-period locomotor activity behavior (Liu et al., 2007cLiu C. Li S. Liu T. Borjigin J. Lin J.D. Transcriptional coactivator PGC-1alpha integrates the mammalian clock and energy metabolism.Nature. 2007; 447: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Furthermore, dose-dependent knockdown of ROR and REV-ERB genes in vitro has a potent effect on the baseline and the amplitude of circadian gene expression (Baggs et al., 2009Baggs J.E. Price T.S. DiTacchio L. Panda S. FitzGerald G.A. Hogenesch J.B. Network features of the mammalian circadian clock.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e52Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Taken in sum, these data demonstrate the important role of the clock gene network in regulating circadian amplitude, resistance to perturbation, and, in several cases, modulation of period length. Although the clock can function in a cell-autonomous manner (for discussion purposes, we extend the definition of autonomy to include potential auto regulation in trans), in vivo rhythms in physiology and behavior result from more complex cellular and humoral interactions. Genetic dissection of the circadian system showed the important role of intercellular coupling in generating physiological and behavioral responses; these explain the apparent discordance among observations from cells, organotypic SCN cultures, and whole animals (Liu et al., 2007bLiu A.C. Welsh D.K. Ko C.H. Tran H.G. Zhang E.E. Priest A.A. Buhr E.D. Singer O. Meeker K. Verma I.M. et al.Intercellular coupling confers robustness against mutations in the SCN circadian clock network.Cell. 2007; 129: 605-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). For example, although Cry1 deletion in mice causes short period length of locomotor activity rhythms, dissociated SCN neurons and peripheral cells derived from these mice are arrhythmic (Liu et al., 2007bLiu A.C. Welsh D.K. Ko C.H. Tran H.G. Zhang E.E. Priest A.A. Buhr E.D. Singer O. Meeker K. Verma I.M. et al.Intercellular coupling confers robustness against mutations in the SCN circadian clock network.Cell. 2007; 129: 605-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that intercellular coupling in the SCN compensates for the loss of Cry1 function and, as a result, masks the more severe cellular clock deficits. Similarly, while Clock gene knockout mice are nearly wild-type in their behavioral rhythms, lung and liver preparations from these mice display arrhythmic gene expression (DeBruyne et al., 2006DeBruyne J.P. Noton E. Lambert C.M. Maywood E.S. Weaver D.R. Reppert S.M.

Weaver D.R. Reppert S.M. Peripheral circadian oscillators require CLOCK.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: R538-R539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In fact, cellular clock defects are often more severe than behavioral in clock gene knockout mice (Brown et al., 2005Brown S.A. Fleury-Olela F. Nagoshi E. Hauser C. Juge C. Meier C.A. Chicheportiche R. Dayer J.M. Albrecht U. Schibler U.

Verma I.M. et al.Intercellular coupling confers robustness against mutations in the SCN circadian clock network.Cell. 2007; 129: 605-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Thus, although transcriptional rhythms are cell autonomous and reflect the cellular nature of the circadian signaling, physiology and behavior result from more complex in vivo interactions. The circadian research community took nearly four decades to identify the above clock components. In metazoan models, successful approaches included forward mutagenesis in flies and mice and cellular and biochemical methods followed by confirmatory reverse genetics. Although these efforts were fruitful, they remain incomplete because evidence, including quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies, suggests that additional clock components and modulators exist (Takahashi, 2004Takahashi J.S. Finding new clock components: past and future.J. Biol. Rhythms. 2004; 19: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Remarkably, circadian clocks exist in cell lines (Balsalobre et al., 1998Balsalobre A. Damiola F. Schibler U. A serum shock induces circadian gene expression in mammalian tissue culture cells.Cell. 1998; 93: 929-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). Some of these lines are amenable to complementary DNA (cDNA) overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) techniques and have been used to identify new components of many signal transduction pathways (for example, see Conkright et al., 2003Conkright M.D. Guzman E. Flechner L. Su A.I. Hogenesch J.B. Montminy M. Genome-wide analysis of CREB target genes reveals a core promoter requirement for cAMP responsiveness.Mol.

To conduct a whole-genome screen for circadian clock modifiers, we used the U2OS (human osteosarcoma) cell line that was successfully employed in chemical screens (Hirota et al., 2008Hirota T. Lewis W.G. Liu A.C. Lee J.W. Schultz P.G. Kay S.A. A chemical biology approach reveals period shortening of the mammalian circadian clock by specific inhibition of GSK-3{beta}.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 20746-20751Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), in dissection of network properties of the oscillator (Baggs et al., 2009Baggs J.E. Price T.S. DiTacchio L. Panda S. FitzGerald G.A. Hogenesch J.B. Network features of the mammalian circadian clock.PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e52Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and in a limited-scale RNAi screen (Maier et al., 2009Maier B. Wendt S. Vanselow J.T. Wallach T. Reischl S. Oehmke S. Schlosser A. Kramer A. A large-scale functional RNAi screen reveals a role for CK2 in the mammalian circadian clock.Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 708-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We screened ∼90,000 individual small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and measured luciferase reporter gene expression every 2 hr for 4 days. We applied statistical algorithms to find modifiers of rhythm amplitude and period length. Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. On the other hand, knockdown of hundreds of genes by multiple independent siRNAs generated strong circadian phenotypes. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on clock function. Protein interaction network analysis indicated that some candidates directly or indirectly interact with known clock components. Gene expression studies showed that some affect the clock by regulating clock component expression levels. Finally, to disseminate this data and integrate with existing public resources, we constructed a database (http://biogps.gnf.org/circadian/). This resource will serve the research community in genetic and biochemical investigations of circadian regulation of physiology and behavior. Because circadian rhythms are dynamic, we employed kinetic, rather than steady-state, bioluminescence detection to assess the persistence and characteristics of rhythms after perturbation. To conduct such a screen, we required a cell line amenable to efficient reverse transfection, where siRNAs are deposited on plates, dried, mixed with transfection reagents and, finally, cells are added to complete the transfection process. We chose U2OS cells for assay development as this model was extensively characterized by functional studies examining knockdown effects of all known clock components with cellular and behavioral phenotypes in knockout mice (Baggs et al., 2009Baggs J.E.

In addition, this model was used in small molecule screening and limited-scale RNAi screening to find modifiers of amplitude and periodicity (Hirota et al., 2008Hirota T. Lewis W.G. Liu A.C. Lee J.W. Schultz P.G. Kay S.A. A chemical biology approach reveals period shortening of the mammalian circadian clock by specific inhibition of GSK-3{beta}.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We established cell lines harboring a rapidly degradable form of luciferase, dLuc, driven by the mouse Bmal1 or Per2 gene promoter (Liu et al., 2008Liu A.C. Tran H.G. Zhang E.E. Priest A.A.

For instance, CRY1 knockdown shortens period length and compromises rhythm persistence, CRY2 knockdown lengthens period length, and knockdown of both results in arrhythmicity. We next adapted these assays for high-throughput screening (HTS) in 96- and 384-well plates. By optimizing growth conditions and transfection efficiency, we obtained consistent bioluminescence rhythms in a HTS format (e.g., ± 0.5 hr of SD in control wells of 384-well plates, n = 7680 wells) with knockdown effects for period and amplitude (see below). Knockdown of known clock components such as CRY1, CRY2, and BMAL1 in this format produced similar cellular clock phenotypes to those in LumiCycle assays using 35 mm dishes (Figure S1). These conditions enabled large-scale siRNA screens. The screening protocol and logic are outlined in Figures 1A and S2 and describe the primary screen, data mining, hit selection, secondary screen, and validation studies. The Bmal1-dLuc line was more robust than our Per2-dLuc line and therefore was used for primary screens in a 384-well format. CRY2 siRNAs were used as positive controls in each plate. We screened an siRNA library (QIAGEN) targeting 17,631 known and 4837 predicted human genes. In these libraries, four siRNA constructs were designed for each gene with a pool of two siRNAs per well (two siRNAs/well, two wells/gene) for a total of 89,872 siRNAs. These siRNAs were prespotted on 384-well plates. After addition of transfection reagent, we seeded approximately 2000 cells into each well to complete the transfection. We measured bioluminescence every 2 hr for 4 days for a total of 48 time points for each well; this temporal resolution was chosen based on simulation studies using data collected from known clock gene perturbation. The primary screen produced a total of >4.3 × 106 data points, which are also deposited in the PubChem Bioassay database (accession number AID 1904; see the Experimental Procedures for details). We used the MultiCycle Analysis program (Actimetrics) to analyze period length and rhythm amplitude for each well. Plate-to-plate variation in period length and amplitude was modest in control wells (period length or τ = 25.20 hr ± 0.55 [mean ± SD], n = 1176; amplitude or A = 4380 ± 1010, n = 1176) (Figures 1B and S3). Knockdown of CRY2, a period length control, resulted in robust lengthening (29.43 hr ± 0.65; n = 1176), while knockdown of BMAL1, an amplitude control, potently reduced amplitude (692 ± 626 arbitrary luminescence units; n = 1176). Gratifyingly, many known clock components had phenotypes in this screen consistent with those seen in knockout animals (Liu et al., 2007bLiu A.C. Welsh D.K. Ko C.H. Tran H.G. Zhang E.E. Priest A.A.

For example, CRY2 knockdown lengthened period, and CRY1 knockdown led to rapid loss of rhythmicity. Knockdown of BMAL1 or CLOCK genes resulted in low amplitude/arrhythmicity, and knockdown of PER1 or PER2 also caused almost immediate arrhythmicity. Consistent with its role as a repressor for RORE-mediated transcription, knockdown of NR1D1 raised overall reporter expression levels and lengthened the period (see below), consistent with a previous report (Baggs et al., 2009Baggs J.E.

Here, we report the molecular mechanism through which H3S10ph triggers transcript elongation of the FOSL1 gene. Serum stimulation induces the PIM1 kinase to phosphorylate the preacetylated histone H3 at the FOSL1 enhancer. The adaptor protein 14-3-3 binds the phosphorylated nucleosome and recruits the histone acetyltransferase MOF, which triggers the acetylation of histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16ac). This histone crosstalk generates the nucleosomal recognition code composed of H3K9acS10ph/H4K16ac determining a nucleosome platform for the bromodomain protein BRD4 binding. The recruitment of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) via BRD4 induces the release of the promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase II and the increase of its processivity. Thus, the single phosphorylation H3S10ph at the FOSL1 enhancer triggers a cascade of events which activate transcriptional elongation."

However, the puzzlingly broad range in centromere complexity, from simple “point” centromeres to multi-megabase arrays of DNA satellites, has defied explanation.

We further propose that the larger centromere sizes in plants and animals and the rapid evolution of their centromeric proteins is the result of an intense battle for evolutionary dominance due to the asymmetric retention of only one product of female meiosis. Centromeres are chromosomal elements that are both necessary and sufficient for chromosome segregation. However, the puzzlingly broad range in centromere complexity, from simple “point” centromeres to multi-megabase arrays of DNA satellites, has defied explanation.

We further propose that the larger centromere sizes in plants and animals and the rapid evolution of their centromeric proteins is the result of an intense battle for evolutionary dominance due to the asymmetric retention of only one product of female meiosis. Some of the earliest cytological investigations of the eukaryotic cell had revealed that each chromosome in the nucleus had a single region called the centromere that is required for faithful segregation of chromosomes during cell division (Flemming, 1882Flemming W. Zellsubstanz, Kern und Zelltheilung. F. C. W. Vogel, Leipzig1882Crossref Google Scholar). The centromere is acted upon by the mitotic spindle, a fibrous network of microtubules that pulls sister chromosomes to opposite poles when cells divide. Thus, the role of centromeres in chromosome segregation has been recognized since close to the inception of cell biology. All eukaryotes require this centromeric function, yet they display remarkably different means of accomplishing this essential biological feat (Amor et al., 2004bAmor D.J. Kalitsis P. Sumer H. Choo K.H. Building the centromere: from foundation proteins to 3D organization.Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 359-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The simplest “point” centromeres are only ∼125 bp and are found in budding yeasts such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Point centromeres are capable of genetically conferring centromeric function on any DNA segment into which they are transferred. In contrast, centromeres in most other organisms appear to be determined in an epigenetic fashion, independent of DNA sequence. Even epigenetically defined centromeres display an enormous range in size and complexity, from just a few kilobases in fungi such as Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Candida albicans, to hundreds of kilobases in most plants and animals. Finally, several lineages of eukaryotes, including nematodes such as Caenorhabditis elegans, have independently arrived at holocentric configurations in which centromeric determinants are distributed throughout the length of the chromosomes. Why is there such a large diversity of centromere configurations? What has prevented the adoption and maintenance of an optimized centromere configuration? We view this problem from the perspective of evolutionary transitions, arguing that rather than representing a continuum of different states of complexity, most centromeres can be described as resulting from a series of discrete evolutionary transitions. Some of the evolutionary forces that have driven these transitions can still be detected in extant organisms. For others, patterns of evolutionary conservation allow us to speculate as to what the driving forces might have been to arrive at the centromere configurations that we observe today. Each of these evolutionary transitions provides unique advantages and disadvantages to the organism. They also belie the expectation of general features among different centromeres and provide a rationale for why some unique features are observed in certain systems. The temporal separation of the processes of DNA replication and cell division in eukaryotes has dictated the need for chromosome segregation to be well coordinated to ensure that genetic information is faithfully segregated to daughter cells during cell division. This coordination process is modulated by centromeres in eukaryotes, but it was not always appreciated that in bacteria, such coordinated segregation mechanisms existed or were even necessary. However, it seems likely that the evolutionary origins of chromosome segregation lie in bacterial partitioning systems that are responsible for the stable segregation of plasmids and bacterial chromosomes. Faithful segregation of plasmid DNA in bacteria results from a series of events that are driven by plasmid-specific components (Ebersbach and Gerdes, 2005Ebersbach G. Gerdes K. Plasmid segregation mechanisms.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2005; 39: 453-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Exemplified by the R1 plasmid from the bacterium Escherichia coli (Figure 1), these components include the parR protein, which binds a cis-acting parC sequence. In different bacterial plasmids, parC can range in complexity from <100 bp to >1 kb, often consisting of many permutations of parR-bound repeat elements (Hayes and Barilla, 2006Hayes F. Barilla D. The bacterial segrosome: a dynamic nucleoprotein machine for DNA trafficking and segregation.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2006; 4: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A third component encoded by the R1 plasmid and other autonomously segregating plasmids is the parM protein, which is homologous to actin in eukaryotes. The parM protein oligomerizes to form filamentous structures that drive the alignment and segregation of chromosomes (Figure 1). Indeed, it has been shown that by binding one end of parM filaments and modulating parM dynamic instability, the parR/parC components can establish a bipolar spindle and use parM polymerization to drive high-fidelity chromosome segregation (Garner et al., 2007Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Weibel D.B. Mullins R.D. Reconstitution of DNA segregation driven by assembly of a prokaryotic actin homolog.Science. 2007; 315: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It is worth noting the simplicity of the bacterial plasmid segregation system in being entirely encoded by the plasmid and thus completely independent of any host proteins, thereby allowing plasmid segregation to occur even when no host chromosome segregation mechanisms exist. Bacterial chromosomes use an actin-based segregation mechanism as well. For example, in the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus, trans-acting proteins bind cis-acting DNA segments near origins of replication (oriC) and directly or indirectly recruit MreB (a bacterial actin homolog like parM), which in turn is captured at the poles of the cell (Bowman et al., 2008Bowman G.R. Comolli L.R. Zhu J. Eckart M. Koenig M. Downing K.H. Moerner W.E. Earnest T. Shapiro L.

A self-associating protein critical for chromosome attachment, division, and polar organization in caulobacter.Cell. 2008; 134: 956-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus, a basic strategy for chromosome segregation appears to have been in place before the origin of eukaryotes: a single cis-acting sequence coordinates the assembly of proteins that then serve to recruit cytoskeletal components to mediate chromosome segregation. Although these chromosome segregation systems are functionally analogous to centromere-based systems in eukaryotes, it seems unlikely that they are homologous. Any scenario that invokes a direct evolutionary ancestral relationship between bacterial DNA-partitioning systems and eukaryotic centromeres (Villasante et al., 2007Villasante A. Abad J.P. Mendez-Lago M. Centromeres were derived from telomeres during the evolution of the eukaryotic chromosome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 10542-10547Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) will have to accommodate fundamental biochemical differences between bacteria and eukaryotes, including the use of microtubules in eukaryotes instead of actin-like filaments as in bacteria despite their shared property of dynamic instability (Garner et al., 2007Garner E.C. Campbell C.S. Weibel D.B. Mullins R.D. Reconstitution of DNA segregation driven by assembly of a prokaryotic actin homolog.Science. 2007; 315: 1270-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The details of chromosome segregation in Archaea (Lundgren and Bernander, 2005Lundgren M. Bernander R. Archaeal cell cycle progress.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) are less clear than in Bacteria. However, the cell cycles of some Archaea (for example, Sulfolobus species) are orchestrated more along the lines of cell cycles in Eukarya, with distinct phases of DNA replication, condensation, and segregation. This similarity is surprising because Sulfolobus species are unusual among Archaea in that they lack histones (Malik and Henikoff, 2003bMalik H.S. Henikoff S. Phylogenomics of the nucleosome.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 882-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Other Archaea such as Methanococcus thermautotrophicus possess histones, yet their chromosome segregation is concomitant with DNA replication, similar to the bacterial partitioning system. It is tempting to suggest that the evolutionary origins of eukaryotic centromeres may lie in Archaea, given the presence of histones and similarities of the cell cycle. Yet, neither the Sulfolobus system nor the Methanococcus system appropriately fits the expectations of a eukaryotic centromere-like ancestor. Thus, it is premature to speculate whether an evolutionary transition occurred from a partitioning-like to a more centromere-like chromosome segregation system within Archaea, although greater insight into this issue is to be expected from the study of chromosome segregation in diverse archaeal lineages. A major evolutionary transition between simple partitioning systems and centromeres was not obvious until long after the first eukaryotic centromeres had already been described. The ability to select for the centromeric properties of circular plasmids first led to the delineation of centromeric (CEN) sequences in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Clarke and Carbon, 1980Clarke L. Carbon J. Isolation of a yeast centromere and construction of functional small circular chromosomes.Nature. 1980; 287: 504-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As it turned out, budding yeast centromeres are exceptional both in terms of their ability to be defined primarily by genetic means (similar to partitioning plasmids in bacteria) and in terms of their compact size. The discovery that centromeres in plants and animals, including human, comprise highly homogeneous repetitive arrays of DNA satellites (Willard, 1990Willard H.F. Centromeres of mammalian chromosomes.Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 410-416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) at first suggested that these centromeres contain a large array of binding sites for hypothetical centromeric proteins and were potentially a multimeric form of the simple S. cerevisiae centromere. These observations raised the promising prospect of identifying a genetic basis for chromosome segregation in all eukaryotes. However, this expectation was tempered by the dramatic lack of homology between centromeric DNA sequences from different organisms. Furthermore, whereas megabase-sized alphoid satellite arrays are found at centromeres in most multicellular eukaryotes, there are prominent exceptions. For example, centromeres in the fly Drosophila melanogaster consist of several different pentameric and other short repeat units (Sun et al., 2003Sun X. Le H.D. Wahlstrom J.M. Karpen G.H. Sequence analysis of a functional Drosophila centromere.Genome Res. 2003; 13: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), whereas otherwise ordinary centromeres of rice almost entirely lack DNA satellites (Nagaki et al., 2004Nagaki K. Cheng Z. Ouyang S. Talbert P.B. Kim M. Jones K.M. Henikoff S. Buell C.R. Jiang J. Sequencing of a rice centromere uncovers active genes.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 138-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). It is now generally accepted that for the bulk of eukaryotes, centromeres are maintained epigenetically and not genetically. For example, it has been reported for the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Steiner and Clarke, 1994Steiner N.C. Clarke L. A novel epigenetic effect can alter centromere function in fission yeast.Cell. 1994; 79: 865-874Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), flies (Agudo et al., 2000Agudo M. Abad J.P. Molina I. Losada A. Ripoll P. Villasante A. A dicentric chromosome of Drosophila melanogaster showing alternate centromere inactivation.Chromosoma. 2000; 109: 190-196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and humans (Higgins et al., 2005Higgins A.W. Gustashaw K.M. Willard H.F. Engineered human dicentric chromosomes show centromere plasticity.Chromosome Res. 2005; 13: 745-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) that the same DNA sequence could be either centromeric or not depending on whether it had functioned as a centromere in previous cell cycles. The most compelling evidence in favor of an epigenetic basis for centromere inheritance comes from studies of human neocentromeres, in which a previously noncentromeric chromosomal fragment is retained owing to the acquisition in the fragment of a functional centromere (Marshall et al., 2008Marshall O.J. Chueh A.C. Wong L.H. Choo K.H. Neocentromeres: new insights into centromere structure, disease development, and karyotype evolution.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2008; 82: 261-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Such neocentromeres typically arise in euchromatic regions that are otherwise unremarkable with respect to sequence composition and yet are faithfully transmitted in mitosis and even in meiosis (Amor et al., 2004aAmor D.J. Bentley K. Ryan J. Perry J. Wong L. Slater H. Choo K.H. Human centromere repositioning “in progress”.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 6542-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, Tyler-Smith et al., 1999Tyler-Smith C. Gimelli G. Giglio S. Floridia G. Pandya A. Terzoli G. Warburton P.E. Earnshaw W.C. Zuffardi O. Transmission of a fully functional human neocentromere through three generations.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 64: 1440-1444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although most human neocentromeres are pathological chromosome aberrations that are evolutionarily rare and transient, it has become apparent that on occasion, the shift of a centromere to a new position becomes fixed, resulting in a permanent karyotypic change (Cardone et al., 2007Cardone M.F. Lomiento M. Teti M.G. Misceo D. Roberto R. Capozzi O. D'Addabbo P. Ventura M. Rocchi M. Archidiacono N. Evolutionary history of chromosome 11 featuring four distinct centromere repositioning events in Catarrhini.Genomics. 2007; 90: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the primate lineage, newly evolved centromeres are notably deficient in genes, suggesting that centromere function is incompatible with gene activity (Lomiento et al., 2008Lomiento M. Jiang Z. D'Addabbo P. Eichler E.E. Rocchi M. Evolutionary-new centromeres preferentially emerge within gene deserts.Genome Biol. 2008; 9: R173Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We can speculate as to what selective forces might have caused the transition from genetic to epigenetic centromeres. One clue comes from what we have already described regarding the chromosome segregation system in bacteria. Bacterial plasmids such as R1 harbor their own segregation machinery. Hijacking the cis-acting sequences that provide equal partitioning from bacterial chromosomes (and possibly from plasmids in budding yeasts, discussed later) would be a facile way for selfish plasmids to subvert the host segregation apparatus to facilitate their own segregation. However, in the case of epigenetically defined centromeres, there is no cis-acting sequence that would benefit a parasitic element (Dawe and Henikoff, 2006Dawe R.K. Henikoff S. Centromeres put epigenetics in the driver's seat.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 662-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Selfish elements might passively exploit epigenetic centromeres by, for example, inserting within pericentric regions where recombination is low or nonexistent. However, this hijacking would require more sophisticated mechanisms that are harder to maintain. In the absence of a cis-acting sequence that defines centromeres (like the parC sequence in the R1 plasmid), what marks epigenetic centromeres? One obvious difference between the bacterial partitioning system and eukaryotic chromosome segregation is the presence of histones (descended from archaeal histones) that wrap DNA into nucleosome particles to form chromatin (Malik and Henikoff, 2003bMalik H.S. Henikoff S. Phylogenomics of the nucleosome.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 882-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, Sandman and Reeve, 2006Sandman K. Reeve J.N. Archaeal histones and the origin of the histone fold.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 520-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Chromatin not only imposed challenges but also afforded opportunities for eukaryotic genomes to evolve a coordinated chromosome segregation strategy that could accommodate the uncoupling of DNA replication and chromosome segregation. One innovation that becomes apparent when comparing centromeric proteins from diverse eukaryotic lineages is the presence of a dedicated centromeric histone (CenH3; CENP-A in mammals) that is ubiquitously and constitutively found at nearly all eukaryotic centromeres, with the notable exception of the parasitic trypanosome protozoa (Talbert et al., 2008Talbert P.B. Bayes J.J. Henikoff S. Evolution of centromeres and kinetochores: A two-part fugue.in: De Wulf P. Earnshaw W.C. The Kinetochore. Springer, Berlin2008Google Scholar). The presence of a variant histone and a highly specialized chromatin structure at centromeres is a potential explanation for their unique characteristics and stable propagation. The misincorporation of CenH3 in noncentromeric regions is sufficient to cause chromosome mis-segregation in Drosophila (Heun et al., 2006Heun P. Erhardt S. Blower M.D. Weiss S. Skora A.D. Karpen G.H. Mislocalization of the Drosophila centromere-specific histone CID promotes formation of functional ectopic kinetochores.Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 303-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, Moreno-Moreno et al., 2006Moreno-Moreno O. Torras-Llort M. Azorin F. Proteolysis restricts localization of CID, the centromere-specific histone H3 variant of Drosophila, to centromeres.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 6247-6255Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and in budding yeast (Collins et al., 2007Collins K.A. Camahort R. Seidel C. Gerton J.L. Biggins S. The overexpression of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae centromeric histone H3 variant mutant protein leads to a defect in kinetochore biorientation.Genetics. 2007; 175: 513-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that CenH3 is both necessary and sufficient for the formation of the kinetochore, the protein-based structure essential for microtubule attachment during chromosome segregation that assembles on centromeres. Thus, this protein can be regarded as the epigenetic “mark” of the centromere (Allshire and Karpen, 2008Allshire R.C. Karpen G.H. Epigenetic regulation of centromeric chromatin: old dogs, new tricks?.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 923-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the sufficiency of CenH3 for centromere formation might not be completely general—similar “misincorporation” experiments using human CENP-A failed to induce neocentromere formation (Van Hooser et al., 2001Van Hooser A.A. Ouspenski I.I. Gregson H.C. Starr D.A. Yen T.J. Goldberg M.L. Yokomori K. Earnshaw W.C. Sullivan K.F. Brinkley B.R. Specification of kinetochore-forming chromatin by the histone H3 variant CENP-A.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3529-3542PubMed Google Scholar). We suggest that this lack of sufficiency for human CENP-A arises from the colonization of primate centromeres by a single alpha satellite repeat unit, which might have led to the evolution of a supplementary mechanism of satellite targeting for centromere formation. In support of this possibility, we note that human artificial chromosomes require alpha satellite arrays with binding sites for the centromeric DNA-binding protein CENP-B (Harrington et al., 1997Harrington J.J. Van Bokkelen G. Mays R.W. Gustashaw K. Willard H.F. Formation of de novo centromeres and construction of first-generation human artificial microchromosomes.Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). In contrast, fly centromeres lack single satellite arrays (Sun et al., 2003Sun X. Le H.D. Wahlstrom J.M. Karpen G.H. Sequence analysis of a functional Drosophila centromere.Genome Res. 2003; 13: 182-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and thus may have evolved “purely” epigenetic centromeres. Understanding how CenH3 nucleosomes are assembled into centromeric nucleosomes at the same region in a chromosome every cell cycle becomes a key question in understanding the mechanistic basis for centromere inheritance. Since the discovery of CENP-A (Earnshaw and Rothfield, 1985Earnshaw W.C. Rothfield N. Identification of a family of human centromere proteins using autoimmune sera from patients with schleroderma.Chromosoma. 1985; 91: 313-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the demonstration that it is a variant of histone H3 (Palmer et al., 1991Palmer D.K. O'Day K. Trong H.L. Charbonneau H. Margolis R.L. Purification of the centromere-specific protein CENP-A and demonstration that it is a distinctive histone.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In contrast to histone H3, which is essentially invariant between different species, CenH3 proteins are remarkably diverse with many features that are distinct from canonical H3 proteins (Talbert et al., 2008Talbert P.B. Bayes J.J. Henikoff S. Evolution of centromeres and kinetochores: A two-part fugue.in: De Wulf P. Earnshaw W.C. The Kinetochore. Springer, Berlin2008Google Scholar). The differences between CenH3 and H3 have been exploited in domain-swap experiments (where regions of H3 are replaced by corresponding regions from CenH3 and vice versa) to identify sequences required for centromere localization (Black et al., 2004Black B.E.

These studies have revealed that the highly distinct N-terminal tail of CenH3 is mostly dispensable for its correct localization. Instead, regions that are within the histone-fold domain are consistently required for centromere localization. Swap experiments between CenH3 proteins from related Drosophila species identified the critical region for centromere localization to be around Loop 1 (Vermaak et al., 2002Vermaak D. Hayden H.S. Henikoff S. Centromere targeting element within the histone fold domain of Cid.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7553-7561Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), which in many lineages is the most divergent region of the histone-fold domain of the protein (Talbert et al., 2008Talbert P.B. Bayes J.J. Henikoff S. Evolution of centromeres and kinetochores: A two-part fugue.in: De Wulf P. Earnshaw W.C. The Kinetochore. Springer, Berlin2008Google Scholar). Although these swap and substitution studies imply that particular changes could abolish correct centromere localization, other studies have revealed a surprising promiscuity in CenH3 deposition. For example, CenH3 of budding yeast can correctly localize to human centromeres and is able to support normal human centromere function in the absence of CENP-A (Wieland et al., 2004Wieland G. Orthaus S. Ohndorf S. Diekmann S. Hemmerich P. Functional complementation of human centromere protein A (CENP-A) by Cse4p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6620-6630Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), despite a high degree of divergence in protein sequence. Insight into the basis for these varied observations comes from evidence that nucleosomes containing CenH3 are structurally very different from canonical nucleosomes (Black et al., 2004Black B.E.

In Drosophila, a variety of biochemical and biophysical measurements have revealed that the native CenH3 nucleosome is a heterotypic tetramer (hemisome) that consists of one molecule each of CenH3, H4, H2A, and H2B and that wraps less DNA than conventional H3-containing octamers (Dalal et al., 2007bDalal Y. Wang H. Lindsay S. Henikoff S.

Purified arrays of CenH3 hemisomes are separated by long linker regions and are resistant to folding into higher-order structures. This finding has led to the idea that arrays of hemisomes could be constitutively “open” in terms of the chromatin structure, so as to be forced to the outside surface of the chromosome when it condenses during mitosis (Dalal et al., 2007aDalal Y. Furuyama T. Vermaak D. Henikoff S. Structure, dynamics, and evolution of centromeric nucleosomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 15974-15981Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although it remains to be demonstrated that hemisomes are the general structural form of CenH3 nucleosomes, it is possible that the easy disassembly of CENP-A nucleosomes produced in vitro results from an inherently weak CenH3-CenH3 interface (Conde e Silva et al., 2007Conde e Silva N.

However, it is still unclear how similar human iPSCs are to human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESCs). Here, we describe the transcriptional profile of human iPSCs generated without viral vectors or genomic insertions, revealing that these cells are in general similar to hESCs but with significant differences. For the generation of human iPSCs without viral vectors or genomic insertions, pluripotent factors Oct4 and Nanog were cloned in episomal vectors and transfected into human fetal neural progenitor cells. The transient expression of these two factors, or from Oct4 alone, resulted in efficient generation of human iPSCs. The reprogramming strategy described here revealed a potential transcriptional signature for human iPSCs yet retaining the gene expression of donor cells in human reprogrammed cells free of viral and transgene interference. Moreover, the episomal reprogramming strategy represents a safe way to generate human iPSCs for clinical purposes and basic research."

We used single-molecule microscopy to understand the mechanism of length-dependent depolymerization by the budding yeast kinesin-8, Kip3p. We found that after binding at a random position on a microtubule and walking to the plus end, an individual Kip3p molecule pauses there until an incoming Kip3p molecule bumps it off. Kip3p dissociation is accompanied by removal of just one or two tubulin dimers (on average). Such a cooperative mechanism leads to a depolymerization rate that is proportional to the flux of motors to the microtubule end and accounts for the length dependence of depolymerization. This type of feedback between length and disassembly may serve as a model for understanding how an ensemble of molecules can measure and control polymer length.

The sizes of organelles are relatively constant in cells of a given type. This is remarkable for dynamic organelles—such as axonemes, microvilli, and mitotic spindles—whose molecules exchange with those in the cytoplasm on the timescale of minutes to days (Taylor and Wang, 1980Taylor D.L. Wang Y.L.

Sloboda R.D. Microinjection of fluorescent tubulin into dividing sea urchin cells.J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 1249-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In such organelles, exchange takes place by polymerization and depolymerization of the constituent cytoskeletal filaments, and the overall length depends on the balance of these processes (Marshall et al., 2005Marshall W.F.

Because polymerization and depolymerization take place exclusively at the filament ends, control of organelle size must involve feedback between the filament length and the growth/shrinkage dynamics; the feedback must have negative sign in the sense that a longer filament leads to a lower polymerization rate or a higher depolymerization rate. With such feedback, a balance between polymerization and depolymerization will be achieved at a unique filament length (Marshall, 2004Marshall W.F. Cellular length control systems.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 677-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, Howard and Hyman, 2007Howard J. Hyman A.A. Microtubule polymerases and depolymerases.Curr. Opin.

An example of tight size regulation is the mitotic spindle. In Drosophila S2 cells, the length of the spindle at metaphase varies little from cell to cell (11.5 ± 2.0 μm, mean ± standard deviation [SD], Goshima et al., 2005Goshima G. Wollman R. Stuurman N. Scholey J.M. Vale R.D. Length control of the metaphase spindle.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1979-1988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Many proteins are involved in modulating spindle length. For example, reducing the levels of the polymerase Msps (chTOG/XMAP215) and other plus-tip proteins by RNAi decreases spindle lengths, whereas reducing the levels of depolymerases such as Klp10A (kinesin-13) and Klp67A (kinesin-8) increases spindle lengths (Goshima et al., 2005Goshima G.

Interfering with depolymerizing kinesins also increases spindle size in yeast (Straight et al., 1998Straight A.F. Sedat J.W. Murray A.W. Time-lapse microscopy reveals unique roles for kinesins during anaphase in budding yeast.J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and human cells (Mayr et al., 2007Mayr M.I. Hümmer S. Bormann J. Grüner T. Adio S. Woehlke G. Mayer T.U. The human kinesin Kif18A is a motile microtubule depolymerase essential for chromosome congression.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 488-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Overexpressing these proteins has the opposite effect to reducing their levels (Goshima et al., 2005Goshima G. Wollman R. Stuurman N. Scholey J.M. Vale R.D. Length control of the metaphase spindle.Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1979-1988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, which of these microtubule-regulating proteins control length—meaning that they provide the feedback between length and filament dynamics—and which simply modulate length is not known. Recently, we discovered, using an assay with purified proteins, that the budding yeast kinesin-8, Kip3p, depolymerizes longer microtubules faster than shorter microtubules (Varga et al., 2006Varga V. Helenius J. Tanaka K. Hyman A.A. Tanaka T.U. Howard J. Yeast kinesin-8 depolymerizes microtubules in a length-dependent manner.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Similar activity was reported for a human homolog (Mayr et al., 2007Mayr M.I. Hümmer S. Bormann J. Grüner T. Adio S. Woehlke G. Mayer T.U. The human kinesin Kif18A is a motile microtubule depolymerase essential for chromosome congression.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 488-498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). These experiments were done on stabilized microtubules, a model for the GTP cap that regulates the catastrophic conversion of a growing microtubule to a shrinking one, suggesting that kinesin-8s induce length-dependent catastrophes of dynamic microtubules. For the fission yeast homologs, no depolymerization activity has been observed in vitro (Grissom et al., 2009Grissom P.M. Fiedler T. Grishchuk E.L. Nicastro D. West R.R. McIntosh J.R. Kinesin-8 from fission yeast: a heterodimeric, plus-end-directed motor that can couple microtubule depolymerization to cargo movement.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but in vivo they have been shown to promote catastrophes (Unsworth et al., 2008Unsworth A. Masuda H. Dhut S. Toda T. Fission yeast kinesin-8 Klp5 and Klp6 are interdependent for mitotic nuclear retention and required for proper microtubule dynamics.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2008; 19: 5104-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and do so in a length-dependent manner (Tischer et al., 2009Tischer C. Brunner D. Dogterom M. Force- and kinesin-8-dependent effects in the spatial regulation of fission yeast microtubule dynamics.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2009; 5: 250Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, kinesin-8s are not just modulators of filament dynamics, but may provide the negative feedback needed to control the lengths of microtubules and thereby microtubule-containing structures like the mitotic spindle. Testing this hypothesis in cells requires more refined experiments than simple alterations of protein levels: it requires replacement by proteins whose depolymerization properties have been altered such that the length dependence is changed in predictable ways. A prerequisite of such experiments is an understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying length control. This is the goal of the present paper. Moreover, length-dependent depolymerization is a fascinating problem in itself: how do molecules that are only a few tens of nanometers in diameter know to depolymerize a 10 μm-long microtubule faster than a 5 μm-long microtubule, when both microtubules are hundreds of times larger than the dimensions of Kip3p? One possible model for length-dependent depolymerization is the antenna model shown in Figure 1 (Varga et al., 2006Varga V. Helenius J. Tanaka K. Hyman A.A. Tanaka T.U. Howard J. Yeast kinesin-8 depolymerizes microtubules in a length-dependent manner.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). According to this model, motor molecules bind randomly along the length of the microtubule and their high processivity funnels them to the plus end, leading to depolymerization. The model predicts that the motors form a concentration gradient along a microtubule (increasing toward the plus end), as has been observed for kinesin-8 in vitro (Varga et al., 2006Varga V. Helenius J. Tanaka K. Hyman A.A. Tanaka T.U. Howard J. Yeast kinesin-8 depolymerizes microtubules in a length-dependent manner.Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and in vivo (Stumpff et al., 2008Stumpff J. von Dassow G. Wagenbach M. Asbury C. Wordeman L. The kinesin-8 motor Kif18A suppresses kinetochore movements to control mitotic chromosome alignment.Dev. Cell. 2008; 14: 252-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been proposed that kinesin-5 uses a similar mechanism to control the lengths of kinetochore microtubules in budding yeast (Gardner et al., 2008Gardner M.K. Bouck D.C. Paliulis L.V. Meehl J.B. O'Toole E.T. Haase J. Soubry A. Joglekar A.P. Winey M.

In this paper, we have used total-internal-reflection-fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to critically test the antenna model and understand the molecular mechanism of the actual depolymerization event mediated by Kip3p. By directly observing the behavior of individual Kip3p molecules on microtubules over a wide range of Kip3p concentrations, we found that an individual Kip3p molecule remains stationary at the plus end, and that its dissociation is greatly accelerated by incoming Kip3p molecules. Dissociation is accompanied by removal of just one or two tubulin dimers. Incorporation of this mechanism into a mathematical formulation of the antenna model allowed us to account quantitatively for the length dependence of depolymerization. To understand how Kip3p shortens microtubules, we needed to study the interactions of individual Kip3p molecules with the microtubule lattice and ends over a wide range of Kip3p concentrations. However, a limitation of single-molecule fluorescence experiments is that they can only be performed at low concentrations because otherwise there are too many fluorescent molecules to be able to resolve the individual ones. To overcome this limitation, we performed spiking experiments. In these experiments, the concentration of Kip3p-EGFP was kept low (<0.1 nM) so that individual fluorescent Kip3p molecules interacting with GMPCPP-stabilized, rhodamine-labeled microtubules could be detected by TIRF microscopy. To increase the total Kip3p concentration, we then added variable amounts of unlabeled Kip3p. Spiking experiments revealed an unusual interaction between Kip3p molecules at the microtubule end. At low total Kip3p concentrations (<0.1 nM), single Kip3p-EGFP molecules attached to the microtubules and moved processively with a velocity of 3.2 ± 0.3 μm/min (SD, N = 67) and with a run length of 11 ± 2 μm (standard error of the mean [SEM], N = 26 dissociations that occurred before the molecules reached the plus end) toward the microtubule plus ends. There, they remained for 36 ± 4 s (SEM, N = 46) before dissociating (Figure S1 available online). An example is shown in Figure 2A; end pausing is seen on all microtubules (Figure S2). At these low Kip3p concentrations, the depolymerization rate at the plus ends was ∼0.015 μm/min, similar to the spontaneous depolymerization measured in the absence of Kip3p. When the total Kip3p concentration was increased by adding unlabeled Kip3p to give a depolymerization rate of ∼0.1 μm/min, we measured a similar walking velocity of 2.7 ± 0.4 μm/min (SD, N = 36) and a similar processivity of 13 ± 5 μm (SEM, N = 8). However, remarkably, the end-residence time decreased ∼3-fold to ∼10 s (Figure 2B). When the total Kip3p concentration was increased further to give a depolymerization rate of ∼1 μm/min, the walking velocity (3.0 ± 0.4 μm/min, SD, N = 40) and run length (10 ± 3 μm, SEM, N = 14) again remained almost unchanged. But the end-residence time decreased even further to < 3.5 s (Figure 2C and Movie S1). Thus, the end-residence time decreases as the total concentration of Kip3p increases. This indicates that Kip3p molecules influence each other at the microtubule ends. As the total Kip3p concentration was increased, the depolymerization rate increased. Because all protofilaments must be depolymerizing at the same average rate, we can determine an average lifetime of the terminal tubulin dimers at the microtubule end from the depolymerization rate (using the fact that the tubulin dimer has a length of 8.4 nm; Hyman et al., 1995Hyman A.A. Chretien D. Arnal I. Wade R.H. Structural changes accompanying GTP hydrolysis in microtubules: information from a slowly hydrolyzable analogue guanylyl-(alpha,beta)- methylene-diphosphonate.J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). A plot of the Kip3p end-residence time against this average lifetime (200 molecules on 31 microtubules) was well fitted by a straight line (Figure 2D). The y-intercept was 2.1 ± 0.5 s (SEM), consistent with a small bias due to the minimum frame rate of 3.0 s for these experiments. The slope was 1.00 ± 0.08 (SEM), indicating that on average one tubulin dimer dissociated for each Kip3p that dissociated. This value of the stoichiometry of the Kip3p depolymerase activity (i.e., the number of tubulin dimers removed per Kip3p) is a slight underestimate due to photobleaching of Kip3p-EGFP at the ends. The underestimate is by about 5%, calculated from the average bleaching time of 400 to 600 s at the frame rates used. A second, independent way to estimate the stoichiometry of Kip3p is to divide the number of tubulin dimers that dissociate from the end by the number of Kip3p that arrive at the end. We counted the numbers of Kip3p-EGFP molecules that reached the plus ends in a given time interval and calculated the flux of Kip3p-EGFP to the ends. This Kip3p-EGFP flux was then multiplied by the ratio of the total Kip3p concentration to the concentration of Kip3p-EGFP to estimate the total flux of Kip3p to the microtubule ends. We found that the total flux was strongly correlated with the microtubule depolymerization rate expressed as the number of tubulin dimers dissociating from the end of a microtubule per minute (Figure 2E). We fitted a line through these data with a y-intercept fixed at 26 tubulin dimers per minute (corresponding to the spontaneous depolymerization rate of 0.015 μm/min). The slope of the line was 1.47 ± 0.08 (SEM, N = 450 Kip3p-EGFP molecules on 45 microtubules), with an additional error of ∼10% arising from uncertainty in the ratio of labeled to unlabeled Kip3p. This value of the stoichiometry is overestimated by about 20% due to photobleaching of molecules moving on the lattice. We conclude that each Kip3p molecule arriving at the end causes the dissociation of (on average) one to two tubulin dimers. The observed linearity between the flux of Kip3p to the plus end and the depolymerization rate provided the crucial information needed to formulate the antenna model mathematically. Because the total rate of Kip3p landing on a microtubule is proportional to its length (Figure S3) and the processivity is very high (most motors that bind reach the end), we can predict both the time course of microtubule shortening and the density of Kip3p along the microtubule lattice (Supplemental Data). The depolymerization rate, ν−, of a microtubule of length L is the product of the flux of Kip3p molecules to the end and the distance the microtubule shortens per Kip3p arrival at the end. The flux is ρ(L)(ν+ν−), where ρ(L) is the density of Kip3p at the end of the microtubule and ν is the velocity of movement of Kip3p along the microtubule. Note that the flux is proportional to the sum of the rate at which the motors move to the plus ends and the rate at which the plus ends move to the motors. The shortening distance is equal to nd, where n is the number of tubulin dimers removed per Kip3p molecule (the stoichiometry), and d is the change of microtubule length corresponding to the removal of one tubulin dimer (d = 0.6 nm equals the tubulin dimer length, 8.4 nm, divided by the number of protofilaments in GMPCPP microtubules, 14, Hyman et al., 1995Hyman A.A. Chretien D. Arnal I. Wade R.H. Structural changes accompanying GTP hydrolysis in microtubules: information from a slowly hydrolyzable analogue guanylyl-(alpha,beta)- methylene-diphosphonate.J.

To compare the predictions of the model to the experimental data, we simultaneously measured the length of the rhodamine-labeled microtubules and the density of Kip3p-EGFP molecules (in experiments where no unlabeled motors were added), using epifluorescence and TIRF microscopy, respectively. For these experiments, it was crucial to keep the concentration of Kip3p-EGFP in solution constant over time, i.e., to minimize sequestering effects of Kip3p-EGFP by the microtubules. To alleviate this problem, we used large-volume chambers (depth 400 μm instead of the usual 100 μm) and a low density of microtubules (2–5 microtubules per 80 × 80 μm2). Figure 3A shows a kymograph of a microtubule depolymerizing under these conditions. Two phases of depolymerization were observed. Phase (i) corresponds to an acceleration phase during which a linear density profile of Kip3p-EGFP along the microtubule toward the plus end is being built up (Figure S4A). The density profile accords with the model: at early times (t) after addition of Kip3p, the density increases linearly with distance (x) from the minus end (ρ(x)=rx/ν, x≤νt), where r is the landing rate of Kip3p per unit length of the microtubule lattice, and then remains at a constant value (ρ(x)=rt) until the plus end. This phase finishes when the density profile is fully established and the depolymerization rate reaches its maximum. Phase (ii) corresponds to a slow-down phase during which the density profile of Kip3p-EGFP does not change over time, but the maximum Kip3p-EGFP density at the plus end decreases due to microtubule shortening (Figure S4B). This also accords with the model, which predicts that the density at the plus end is ρ(L)=rL/ν. The change in length of the microtubule over time during both phases is well accounted for by the model (solid red curve in Figure 3A). Importantly, during phase (ii) there is an approximately linear relation between the depolymerization rate and microtubule length (Figure 3B). The theoretical model allowed the stoichiometry to be estimated by a third method. The slope of the depolymerization rate versus microtubule length at microtubule length equal to zero (denoted “final slope,” red dashed line in Figures 3B and S5A) is ndr. By counting the landings of Kip3p-EGFP molecules on microtubules, we measured an association rate constant (r/[Kip3p]) of 24 ± 3 nM−1·min−1·μm−1 (SEM, 65 Kip3p-EGFP molecules landing on 6 microtubules). From the final slope measured at different Kip3p concentrations (Figure 3C), we obtained an estimate of the stoichiometry, 2.3 ± 0.4 (SEM). This estimate is not affected by photobleaching. At high concentrations of Kip3p (Kip3p-EGFP or unlabeled), we observed a third depolymerization phase (ii∗), between the acceleration phase (i) and the slow-down phase (ii), during which the depolymerization rate remained fixed at its maximum value (Figures 3D, S5A, and S5B). Several lines of evidence suggest that this saturation of the depolymerization rate was due to the limited number of Kip3p-binding sites on the microtubule lattice. First, when using Kip3p-EGFP, we observed that the motor density toward the plus end was saturated (Figure 3E between t = 40 s and 160 s). Second, we observed that the maximum depolymerization rate measured during the saturation phase was independent of the initial microtubule length (Figures S5B and S5C) and approximately independent of the Kip3p concentration (data not shown). And third, our model, which took into account the limited number of motor-binding sites on the microtubule lattice, provided a good fit to the whole depolymerization curve including the saturation phase (ii∗) (red line, Figure 3D) and also quantitatively predicted the measured density profiles of Kip3p (compare Figure 3E with Figure 3F) and the depolymerization rates (Figure S5A). The highest depolymerization rates measured during the saturation phases ranged from 2.5 to 4 μm/min in different experiments. This is similar to the velocity of movement of individual Kip3p-EGFP molecules measured under single-molecule conditions (3.2 ± 0.3 μm/min). This gives additional insight into the stoichiometry. The antenna model predicts that during the saturation phase, the depolymerization rate is ν−max=νndρmax/(1−ndρmax), where dρmax is the fraction of the microtubule lattice occupied by Kip3p at saturation (dρmax = 0.5 corresponds to one Kip3p dimer per two tubulin dimers). Thus, the depolymerization rate diverges as ndρmax approaches unity (this is because the faster the depolymerization rate the higher the flux to the end due to the end shortening). However, our observation that the highest depolymerization rates are approximately equal to the walking velocity implies that ndρmax≈0.5. Assuming a maximum microtubule lattice occupancy, dρmax, of 0.25 to 0.5 as estimated by Seitz and Surrey, 2006Seitz A. Surrey T. Processive movement of single kinesins on crowded microtubules visualized using quantum dots.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar for conventional kinesin in ATP, then n is between 1 and 2. A strength of this last estimate of the stoichiometry is that it applies at high Kip3p concentrations (the others are more accurate at low concentrations) and is insensitive to photobleaching. The antenna model predicts that the depolymerization rate increases with length of the microtubule only up to a length equal to the average run length of the motors; beyond this length the depolymerization rate of the microtubule is expected to approach a plateau. This is because the “capture length” of the antenna is limited to the processivity length. Thus, the antenna model predicts that decreasing the processivity will lead to lessening of length-dependent depolymerization. To test this prediction, we decreased the processivity of Kip3p by adding an additional 90 mM KCl to our usual buffer. The average run length in single-molecule experiments (Figure 4A) decreased about 10-fold to 1.6 ± 0.3 μm (SEM, N = 37 dissociations) and in spiking experiments to 1.2 ± 0.1 μm (SEM, N = 128 dissociations). The velocity was unchanged. In the experiment shown in Figure 4B, microtubules depolymerized at a constant rate of ∼0.8 μm/min until they were only a few microns long, when the rate slowed (compare Figure 4B to Figure 3A). While the depolymerization rate was constant, the intensity of Kip3p-EGFP close to the plus end was constant (Figure S6). A plot of the maximum depolymerization rate against microtubule length for several microtubules showed that the rate was independent of length (for microtubules longer than a few microns) (Figure 4C). This length independence was not due to saturation of the Kip3p density because if we used a higher Kip3p concentration, a higher depolymerization rate could be obtained (data not shown). We conclude that high processivity is necessary for length-dependent depolymerization. This tests one of the key assumptions behind the antenna model. To obtain a more detailed picture of the depolymerization event, we localized Kip3p with nanometer precision as it reached the plus end. Because EGFP is not sufficiently photostable for long-term observation at high spatial and temporal resolution, we attached quantum dots (QDs) to the Kip3p molecules. In one arrangement, we bound streptavidin-coated QDs to the motor domain of Kip3p-EGFP using biotinylated anti-His antibodies (Figure 5A). To assure that only one Kip3p-EGFP molecule was attached to a QD, a large excess of QDs was used and the QD-motor ratio was verified using TIRF microscopy. QD-motor complexes were localized with a spatial precision of about 2 nm at a time resolution of 100 ms per frame (Leduc et al., 2007Leduc C. Ruhnow F. Howard J. Diez S. Detection of fractional steps in cargo movement by the collective operation of kinesin-1 motors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 10847-10852Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Figure 5B shows a typical plot of distance versus time for a QD with an attached Kip3p-EGFP molecule. The QD moved processively along the microtubule with a velocity of 3 μm/min until it reached the plus end, where it paused for 7 s. The average end-residence time of 13 QDs was 27 ± 9 s (SEM, N = 10 dissociations). When additional Kip3p was added, leading to an increase in the depolymerization rate, the end-residence time of the QDs decreased: when the average lifetime of the terminal tubulin dimers was 6 s, the average end-residence time of the QDs was 8 ± 2 s (SEM, N = 14). During the end-residence time, the mean position of the QD remained fixed. There was no indication that Kip3p was moving with the shrinking end of a microtubule as would be expected if Kip3p sequentially removed many tubulin dimers from the end. The fluctuations of the QD around its mean position had a standard deviation of about 10 nm, much larger than the 2 nm precision of our apparatus. The fluctuations may be due to the compliance of the linkage between the QD and the attached motor domain. Another possibility is that Kip3p is rocking back and forth between tubulin dimers near the microtubule end. However, the pairwise distance histogram for 17 QDs (Figure 5C) showed no obvious peak at 16 nm, corresponding to the QD-labeled motor domain stepping back and forth between tubulin dimers on either side of the other motor domain. A peak at 8 nm, for example a labeled motor domain alternating between bound and free conformations, cannot be excluded due to the noise. The positional fluctuations imply that diffusion of Kip3p backward from the end is slow: the diffusion coefficient would be about 300 nm2/s (= SD2/2t where t is the time between forward, ATP-driven steps), about 1000 times smaller than the diffusion of other kinesins and other microtubule-associated proteins (Cooper and Wordeman, 2009Cooper J.R. Wordeman L. The diffusive interaction of microtubule binding proteins.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2009; 21: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To check that the pausing of the QDs was not an artifact of the particular geometry of attachment of the QD to the motor or of the EGFP labeling, we performed additional control experiments: QDs were attached to the C termini of Kip3p-EGFP using biotinylated anti-GFP antibodies and to the motor domains of nonlabeled Kip3p using biotinylated anti-His antibodies. Similar results were obtained (Figures S7A and S7B). We conclude that Kip3p pauses at the ends of microtubules for tens of seconds and does not undergo directed backward motion or random one-dimensional diffusion. These QD experiments therefore strongly support a picture in which Kip3p stays very close to the stationary microtubule end and removes only a small number of tubulin dimers. To gain information about the strength of the association of Kip3p with the microtubule end, we performed gliding assays. Kip3p-EGFP molecules were immobilized on a coverslip via anti-GFP antibodies and the gliding of rhodamine-labeled microtubules over the surface was visualized by epifluorescence microscopy. When performing the assays at low Kip3p-EGFP densities (<0.5 molecule/μm2 based on observations of individual motors imaged by TIRF microscopy), gliding microtubules swiveled around a single attachment point on the surface, indicative of processive movement by a single motor (Figure 6, phases 1 and 4). The mean gliding veloci"

Elevated serum levels of YKL-40, which is a secreted heparin-binding glycoprotein, have been associated with a worse prognosis from various advanced human cancers. Yet the role of YKL-40 activity in these cancers is still missing. In this study, we showed that ectopic expression of YKL-40 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and in HCT-116 colon cancer cells led to larger tumor formation with an extensive angiogenic phenotype than did control cancer cells in mice. Affinity-purified recombinant YKL-40 protein promoted vascular endothelial cell angiogenesis in vitro, the effects of which are similar to the activities observed using MDA-MB-231 and HCT-116 cell-conditioned medium after transfection with YKL-40. Furthermore, YKL-40 was found to induce coordination of membrane-bound receptor syndecan-1 and integrin αvβ3 and to activate an intracellular signaling cascade, including focal adhesion kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular signal-related kinase1/2 in endothelial cells. Moreover, blockade of YKL-40 using small-interfering RNA gene knockdown suppressed tumor angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis of human breast cancer showed a correlation between YKL-40 expression and blood vessel density. These findings provide novel insights into angiogenic activities and molecular mechanisms of YKL-40 in cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W2116140011,"Progenitor cell nuclei in the rapidly expanding epithelium of the embryonic vertebrate central nervous system undergo a process called interkinetic nuclear migration (IKNM). Movements of IKNM are generally believed to involve smooth migration of nuclei from apical to basal and back during the G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle, respectively. Yet, this has not been formally demonstrated, nor have the molecular mechanisms that drive IKNM been identified. Using time-lapse confocal microscopy to observe nuclear movements in zebrafish retinal neuroepithelial cells, we show that, except for brief apical nuclear translocations preceding mitosis, IKNM is stochastic rather than smooth and directed. We also show that IKNM is driven largely by actomyosin-dependent forces as it still occurs when the microtubule cytoskeleton is compromised but is blocked when MyosinII activity is inhibited."

Fuz regulates trafficking of membrane cargoes to cilia through its interaction with a GTPase of the Rab family. The planar cell polarity (PCP) signalling pathway is essential for embryonic development because it governs diverse cellular behaviours, and 'core PCP' proteins, such as Dishevelled and Frizzled, have been extensively characterized1,2,3,4. By contrast, the 'PCP effector' proteins, such as Intu and Fuz, remain largely unstudied5,6. These proteins are essential for PCP signalling, but they have never been investigated in mammals and their cell biological activities remain entirely unknown. We report here that Fuz mutant mice show neural tube defects, skeletal dysmorphologies and Hedgehog signalling defects stemming from disrupted ciliogenesis. Using bioinformatics and imaging of an in vivo mucociliary epithelium, we established a central role for Fuz in membrane trafficking, showing that Fuz is essential for trafficking of cargo to basal bodies and to the apical tips of cilia. Fuz is also essential for exocytosis in secretory cells. Finally, we identified a Rab-related small GTPase as a Fuz interaction partner that is also essential for ciliogenesis and secretion. These results are significant because they provide new insights into the mechanisms by which developmental regulatory systems such as PCP signalling interface with fundamental cellular systems such as the vesicle trafficking machinery."

Actin 'comet tails' propel Listeria through the cytoplasm, resulting in bacteria-containing membrane protrusions that are internalized by neighbouring cells. The mechanism by which Listeria overcomes cortical tension to generate protrusions is unknown. Here, we identify bacterial and host proteins that directly regulate protrusions. We show that efficient spreading between polarized epithelial cells requires the secreted Listeria virulence protein InlC (internalin C). We next identify the mammalian adaptor protein Tuba as a ligand of InlC. InlC binds to a carboxy-terminal SH3 domain in Tuba, which normally engages the human actin regulatory protein N-WASP. InlC promotes protrusion formation by inhibiting Tuba and N-WASP activity, probably by impairing binding of N-WASP to the Tuba SH3 domain. Tuba and N-WASP are known to control the structure of apical junctions in epithelial cells. We demonstrate that, by inhibiting Tuba and N-WASP, InlC makes taut apical junctions become slack. Experiments with myosin II inhibitors indicate that InlC-mediated perturbation of apical junctions accounts for the role of this bacterial protein in protrusion formation. Collectively, our results suggest that InlC promotes bacterial dissemination by relieving cortical tension, thereby enhancing the ability of motile bacteria to deform the plasma membrane into protrusions."

Insertion of quantum dots into the lamellipodia of fish keratinocytes now reveals a forward-directed fluid flow that is dependent on myosin II activity. Cytosolic fluid dynamics have been implicated in cell motility1,2,3,4,5 because of the hydrodynamic forces they induce and because of their influence on transport of components of the actin machinery to the leading edge. To investigate the existence and the direction of fluid flow in rapidly moving cells, we introduced inert quantum dots into the lamellipodia of fish epithelial keratocytes and analysed their distribution and motion. Our results indicate that fluid flow is directed from the cell body towards the leading edge in the cell frame of reference, at about 40% of cell speed. We propose that this forward-directed flow is driven by increased hydrostatic pressure generated at the rear of the cell by myosin contraction, and show that inhibition of myosin II activity by blebbistatin reverses the direction of fluid flow and leads to a decrease in keratocyte speed.

https://openalex.org/W2082382370,"Insulin action in the brain is known to inhibit food intake. Now Leona Plum and her colleagues show that in hypothalamic neurons insulin inhibits FoxO1-mediated transcriptional repression of Cpe, a gene that encodes a carboxypeptidase that is required for proper processing of key anorexigenic neuropeptides. The team also found that this pathway is disturbed in states of diet-induced obesity, suggesting that obesity-induced insulin resistance may affect obesity even further. Reduced food intake brings about an adaptive decrease in energy expenditure that contributes to the recidivism of obesity after weight loss. Insulin and leptin inhibit food intake through actions in the central nervous system that are partly mediated by the transcription factor FoxO1. We show that FoxO1 ablation in pro-opiomelanocortin (Pomc)-expressing neurons in mice (here called Pomc-Foxo1−/− mice) increases Carboxypeptidase E (Cpe) expression, resulting in selective increases of α-melanocyte–stimulating hormone (α-Msh) and carboxy-cleaved β-endorphin, the products of Cpe-dependent processing of Pomc. This neuropeptide profile is associated with decreased food intake and normal energy expenditure in Pomc-Foxo1−/− mice. We show that Cpe expression is downregulated by diet-induced obesity and that FoxO1 deletion offsets the decrease, protecting against weight gain. Moreover, moderate Cpe overexpression in the arcuate nucleus phenocopies features of the FoxO1 mutation. The dissociation of food intake from energy expenditure in Pomc-Foxo1−/− mice represents a model for therapeutic intervention in obesity and raises the possibility of targeting Cpe to develop weight loss medications."

Interestingly, unlike other members of the PAP2 superfamily, PRG-1 contains an additional C-terminal hydrophilic domain of around 400 amino acids (Bräuer et al., 2003Bräuer A.U. Savaskan N.E. Kuhn H.

We previously showed that the neuronal cell line N1E-115, when transfected with a prg-1-GFP fusion construct and exposed to LPA, generates increased extracellular LPA degradation products. Moreover, these cells were protected against LPA-induced neurite collapse in a dose-dependent fashion (Bräuer et al., 2003Bräuer A.U. Savaskan N.E. Kuhn H. Prehn S. Ninnemann O. Nitsch R.

Neurosci. 2004; 7: 789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar), which demonstrates that PRG-1 had interfered with lipid phosphate signaling. Our studies have so far revealed that expression of prg-1 is vertebrate- and brain-specific, and that the gene is highly conserved in vertebrate species, including humans. Expression of PRG-1 begins perinatally, is strongly expressed in hippocampal neurons and rapidly upregulated after lesion of the glutamatergic entorhinal fiber tract (Bräuer et al., 2003Bräuer A.U. Savaskan N.E. Kuhn H. Prehn S. Ninnemann O. Nitsch R. A new phospholipid phosphatase, PRG-1, is involved in axon growth and regenerative sprouting.Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Using an antibody against PRG-1, we found the protein exclusively in neurons, as shown by colocalization with the neuronal marker NeuN (Figure 1A). GFAP+ astrocytes or microglial cells and oligodendrocytes (data not shown) were not stained (Figure 1A). Double staining and in situ hybridization showed expression of the prg-1 gene exclusively in NeuN-containing neurons, but not in astrocytes (Figure 1B). PRG-1 did not colocalize with GABAergic markers including glutamic acid decarboxylase-67 (GAD67) or calcium-binding proteins, such as calbindin (CB), calretinin (CR) and parvalbumin (PV). Similarly, no colocalization was observed with prg-1 mRNA by in situ hybridization (Figure 1C). PRG-1 colocalized with ProSAP2 and Homer1, molecules specifically located at the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic synapses (Brakeman et al., 1997Brakeman P.R. Lanahan A.A. O'Brien R. Roche K.

Subfractionation of the synaptosomal preparation (Cotman and Taylor, 1972Cotman C.W. Taylor D. Isolation and structural studies on synaptic complexes from rat brain.J. Cell Biol. 1972; 55: 696-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) showed that PRG-1 was present in the postsynaptic density (PSD), but absent in presynaptic vesicles. Finally, localization at the ultrastructural level revealed DAB-reaction product, indicating PRG-1 immunolabeling exclusively at postsynaptic structures of asymmetric synapses of CA1 pyramidal cells and silver-enhanced immunogold signal of PRG-1 bordering the synaptic cleft (Figure 1D). These data indicate that PRG-1 plays a role at the postsynaptic site of glutamatergic neurons in the hippocampus. We disrupted the prg-1 gene by inserting an IRES-LacZ-MC1-Neo cassette, which deletes the extracellular domains coded on exons 5 and 6 and blocks translation of the intracellular tail coded by exon 7 (Figure S1 available with this article online). The PRG-1−/− mice were viable but showed a transiently reduced weight during development (Figure S2A), a reduction in brain weight (Figure S2B), and a mortality of approximately 50% at 3-4 weeks after birth (Figure S2C). Since we observed seizure-like movements of some PRG-1−/− mice around postnatal day (P) 20, we made in vivo electrographic recordings using intracranial, epidural electrodes above the somatosensory cortex in knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice at P19-P31. In all investigated KO mice (n = 10), but none of the WT mice (n = 7), hypersynchronized activity and preictal events were identified by field potential shifts (>150 μV) as early as around P20 (Figure 2A). Electrographic ictal events and tonic-clonic seizures were observed in 5 of 10 KO mice over the following two days (Figures 2A–2C and Movies S1 and S2). The frequency of field potential discharges was 3–5 Hz during ictal activity and 0.8–1.6 Hz during interictal activity (Figure 2B). All recorded KO mice exhibiting electrographic seizures died during status epilepticus (ictal activity > 30 min). The KO mice with implanted electrodes at both hemispheres showed preictal events at only one, but ictal activity at both, hemispheres (KO, n = 4; WT, n = 3; Figure 2C), suggesting a focal ictogenesis with secondary generalization. In a number of KO mice only hypersynchronized activity, but no ictal events, were registered (n = 3). These in vivo recordings indicate that lack of PRG-1 results in severe alteration of synaptic transmission leading to juvenile epileptic seizures. Surprisingly, histological and immunocytochemical studies revealed no morphological alterations in PRG-1−/− mice. In the hippocampus of PRG-1−/− mice at ∼P21, pyramidal neurons had developed normally as shown by the neuronal marker NeuN (Figure 3A). Specifically, the distribution of inhibitory GABAergic interneurons expressing parvalbumin was not altered in these mice (Figure 3A). Also, synaptic innervation of CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells was unchanged at P21 in PRG-1−/− mice (Figure S3). Whole-cell patch clamp experiments in current clamp mode on WT and KO mice at that age did not reveal any obvious difference in intrinsic properties of CA1 pyramidal cells that would indicate alteration of the cellular architecture of individual neurons (Figure 3B). In vitro studies of the robust network rhythms in the hippocampus (Maier et al., 2003Maier N. Nimmrich V. Draguhn A. Cellular and network mechanisms underlying spontaneous sharp wave-ripple complexes in mouse hippocampal slices.J. Physiol. 2003; 550: 873-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) by analyzing sharp waves (SPW) and accompanying ripples in the CA3 area in hippocampal slices from PRG-1 KO mice at P21 (Figure 3C) revealed that SPW incidence was not altered in either condition (WT: 2.2 ± 0.2 Hz versus KO: 2.4 ± 0.6 Hz; n = 8 for both groups, Mann-Whitney Test, p = 0.44; Figure 3D). Likewise, spectral frequency and ripple power were not significantly altered in slices from WT or PRG-1 KO animals (frequency: 222.5 ± 4.5 Hz and 218.2 ± 6.8 Hz, for WT and KO, respectively; n = 8, Mann-Whitney Test, p = 0.64; ripple power: controls: 150 ± 43 μV versus 209 ± 48 μV, n = 8, Mann-Whitney Test, p = 0.44; Figure 3D). However, bath application of carbachol induced gamma oscillation in WT slices (Figure 3E) (Fisahn et al., 1998Fisahn A. Pike F.G. Buhl E.H. Paulsen O. Cholinergic induction of network oscillations at 40 Hz in the hippocampus in vitro.Nature. 1998; 394: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). In slices from KO animals, we additionally detected interictal discharges (∼78% of tested slices; compare to data presented in Figure 3C with summary diagram in Figure 3D). These findings suggest that PRG-1 deficiency results in pathological network synchronization, probably due to a pathological increase of excitatory synaptic transmission. To elucidate the mechanistic role of PRG-1 in the cellular physiology of hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we first analyzed the so-called input-output behavior in area CA1 of acute hippocampal slices around P21. fEPSPs evoked by Schaffer collateral stimulation in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 hippocampal region showed that slices from PRG-1 KO mice (n = 10) were highly hyperexcitable compared with WT litters (n = 3, paired t test for every fiber volley, p < 0.05) (Figure 4A). PRG-1+/− mice (n = 6), which show a PRG-1 expression of approximately 50% of that of WT animals, exhibited intermediate values (Figure 4A). At single-cell level, PRG-1 KO mice showed a larger synaptic current (Figure 4B) and significantly higher mEPSC frequency (KO (n = 15, 3.22 ± 0.34 Hz) compared to WT mice (n = 14, 1.79 ± 0.26 Hz); student's t test: p < 0.01; Figure 4C, left panel) as recorded from CA1 pyramidal cells in voltage clamp mode. However, the mEPSC amplitude did not vary significantly between PRG-1 KO and WT (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p > 0.05, WT mean = 16.63 ± 0.13 pA, KO mean = 15.6 ± 0.14 pA, Figure 4C, right panel). This effect was specific for excitatory transmission on pyramidal neurons because (1) synaptically evoked IPSCs at different stimulation strengths did not differ between WT (n = 8) and PRG-1 KO (n = 7; paired t test for every stimulation strength, not significant for all points with p > 0.05; Figure 4D) mice; (2) the IV-curve of inhibitory currents showed no significant difference between WT (n = 6) and PRG-1 KO (n = 5, Figure 4E) mice, and (3) mIPSC frequency (WT n = 4, 2.13 ± 0.08 Hz, KO n = 4, 1.96 ± 0.07 Hz; student's t test: p = 0.13; Figure 4F) and amplitude (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p > 0.05, WT mean = 13.85 ± 0.07 pA, KO mean = 13.01 ± 0.1 pA, Figure 4F, right panel) did not vary between WT and PRG-1 KO mice. These findings demonstrate that excitatory transmission in PRG-1 KO mice was significantly increased in CA1 pyramidal neurons, whereas inhibitory events were not altered. To differentiate between network and single-cell phenotype, the prg-1 gene was deleted in a small subset of CA1 pyramidal cells that normally express PRG-1 protein (Figure 1A). This was achieved by Cre recombinase expression, which coexpressed GFP in a PRG-1-conditional KO mouse (for construct, see Figure S4) using in utero electroporation. These animals, aged about P21, did not show any signs of seizures. We performed simultaneous recordings from GFP+ (PRG-1 KO genotype) and GFP− (WT genotype) CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal slices. Stimulus-evoked EPSC amplitudes were significantly increased in KO pyramidal cells compared with WT pyramidal cells (KO (n = 7); WT (n = 7); student's t test: p < 0.01; Figure 5A, left). Recordings from GFP+ and GFP− CA1 pyramidal cells showed a significantly higher mEPSC frequency in the PRG-1-deficient pyramidal cells compared with PRG-1-expressing pyramidal cells (KO (n = 7, 4.02 ± 0.78 Hz); WT (n = 4, 1.96 ± 0.23 Hz); student's t test: p < 0.05; Figure 5B left). In this setting, the majority of cells expressed PRG-1, as did, consequently, the majority of afferents on a PRG-1−/− CA1 pyramidal cell derived from WT CA3 neurons. This indicates that the increase in neuronal excitability is due to the lack of PRG-1 at the postsynaptic side. Next, we electroporated prg-1 coexpressing GFP+ into PRG-1 KO mice to analyze whether expression of PRG-1 in single neurons can rescue the pathophysiological phenotype independently of the surrounding KO environment. Simultaneous recordings from GFP+ (PRG-1+) and GFP− (KO genotype) CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal slices showed significantly decreased EPSC amplitudes in PRG-1-expressing pyramidal cells compared with KO pyramidal cells (PRG-1+/GFP+ (n = 10); KO/GFP− (n = 10); student's t test: p < 0.01; Figure 5A right). mEPSC frequency was significantly reduced in the GFP+ cells expressing PRG-1, indicating a rescued function (KO/GFP−: n = 4, 4.01 ± 0.29 Hz; PRG-1+/GFP+: n = 5, 1.87 ± 0.08 Hz; student's t test: p < 0.01; Figure 5B right). These data show that lack of PRG-1 in an individual postsynaptic neuron increases its excitatory synaptic input. To test for changes in the molecular machinery of synaptic transmission, we analyzed presynaptic markers, such as the vesicular GABA or glutamate transporters and postsynaptic AMPA and NMDA receptors subunits. Immunofluorescent staining showed no alteration in the expression of these molecules between PRG-1 KO and their WT litters within the hippocampus at P21 (Figure 6A). Western blotting showed no changes in expression of the postsynaptic density marker PSD-95 or the glutamate receptor subunits NR-1, NR2A/B, GluR1, GluR2/3, and GluR4 at the postsynaptic density in PRG-1 KO mice compared with WT littermates (Figure 6B). We used an antibody against an extracellular epitope of GluR2 as a marker for AMPA receptors located in the dendritic membrane, which were in direct colocalization with VGlut1 as a marker for glutamatergic synapses. We could not detect any significant difference in the presence of AMPA receptors at glutamatergic synapses (Figure 6C). Finally, we studied the AMPA/NMDA ratio (Figure 6D) and changes in the holding current in postsynaptic neurons on AMPA application (Figure 6E), both of which showed no difference between WT and PRG-1 KO animals (AMPA/NMDA: n (WT) = 4, n (KO) = 8, p = 0.75; AMPA wash in: n (WT) = 4, n (KO) = 5, p = 0.53). Therefore, we concluded that lack of PRG-1 was not affecting the postsynaptic molecular machinery involved in excitatory transmission, which would have resulted in overexcitation and eventually seizure activity. Rather, we hypothesized a postpresynaptic signaling pathway that is modulated by PRG-1. Next, we assessed the potential interaction of PRG-1 with bioactive phospholipids such as LPA at the synapse. Using fluorescence-coupled phosphatidic acid, as established in expression systems by other groups (Renault et al., 2004Renault A.D. Sigal Y.J. Morris A.J. Lehmann R. Soma-germ line competition for lipid phosphate uptake regulates germ cell migration and survival.Science. 2004; 305: 1963-1966Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, Roberts and Morris, 2000Roberts R.Z. Morris A.J. Role of phosphatidic acid phosphatase 2a in uptake of extracellular lipid phosphate mediators.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1487: 33-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), uptake of fluorescence-labeled lipids was reduced by about 50% in PRG-1−/− neurons when compared to WT neurons in culture (n (WT) = 30, n (KO) = 38, student's t test, p < 0.001) (Figure 7A). We then determined whether PRG-1 modulation of excitability at glutamatergic synapses is dependent on its involvement in lipid phosphate signaling by expressing a mutated PRG-1 protein in PRG-1−/− animals using in utero electroporation. This protein was coexpressed with GFP+, and point-mutated at a critical extracellular motif (H253K) known to disrupt the interaction of LPPs with lipid phosphates in the extracellular space (Bräuer et al., 2003Bräuer A.U. Savaskan N.E. Kuhn H. Prehn S. Ninnemann O. Nitsch R. A new phospholipid phosphatase, PRG-1, is involved in axon growth and regenerative sprouting.Nat.

J. 2000; 345: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Although the protein was also detected at the plasma membrane of GFP+ pyramidal cells at glutamatergic synapses (Figure S6), mEPSC frequency was not reduced, indicating that a functional rescue, as obtained by expression of the WT protein, was not achieved (GFP+ (n = 8, 3.04 ± 0.29 Hz); GFP− (n = 4, 2.96 ± 0.23 Hz); student's t test: p = 0.855; Figure 7B). Taken together, these findings suggest that the modulatory role of PRG-1 in excitatory transmission depends on its interaction with and uptake of bioactive lipids mediated by the molecule's extracellular domains. Finally, we investigated the signaling mechanisms at the presynaptic terminal modulated by PRG-1 at the excitatory synapse. In an independent set of experiments, we directly tracked the time course of the LPA influence on mEPSCs on single CA1 pyramidal cells in slices of WT animals. Here, bath application of 10 μM LPA induced a two-fold increase in mEPSC frequency in each CA1 neuron of WT animals tested (WT: before LPA, 0.98 ± 0.20 Hz; after LPA, 1.86 ± 0.32 Hz; mean ratio LPA/baseline: 2.00 ± 0.11; n = 10; p < 0.01; paired student's t test; Figure 7C). In contrast, no change was detected in mIPSC frequency (Figure S7A). Moreover, in PRG-1−/− animals, LPA enhanced the mEPSC frequency to a mean ratio of 1.34 ± 0.08 (n = 7, p < 0.01). This increase, however, was significantly smaller in comparison to WT animals (p < 0.001, independent t test; Figure S7B). LPA did not induce these effects in slices obtained from LPA2 receptor (LPA2-R)-deficient animals (LPA2-R-KO: before LPA 0.67 ± 0.20 Hz, after LPA 0.64 ± 0.21 Hz; mean ratio LPA/baseline: 0.96 ± 0.09; n = 6; p = 0.43; Figure 7C). We also assessed the presence of the LPA2-R in the hippocampus using a specific antibody (Shida et al., 2004Shida D. Watanabe T. Aoki J. Hama K. Kitayama J. Sonoda H. Kishi Y. Yamaguchi H. Sasaki S. Sako A. et al.Aberrant expression of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptors in human colorectal cancer.Lab. Invest. 2004; 84: 1352-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar; Figure S8A). By means of confocal triple labeling (Figure 7D), we identified specific expression of LPA2 receptors in presynaptic terminals of the glutamatergic synapse due to its colocalization with Munc 13-1, a marker for the active zone at the presynaptic membrane (Varoqueaux et al., 2002Varoqueaux F. Sigler A. Rhee J.S. Brose N. Enk C. Reim K. Rosenmund C. Total arrest of spontaneous and evoked synaptic transmission but normal synaptogenesis in the absence of Munc13-mediated vesicle priming.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 9037-9042Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), and VGlut-1, a marker for vesicles of the glutamatergic bouton (Takamori et al., 2000Takamori S. Rhee J.S. Rosenmund C. Jahn R. Identification of a vesicular glutamate transporter that defines a glutamatergic phenotype in neurons.Nature. 2000; 407: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar; Figures 7D and S8B). Immunostaining for LPA2-R was found in presynaptic terminals of an asymmetric, glutamatergic junction, while symmetric, GABAergic synapses in the direct vicinity were not labeled (Figure 7E). As final proof of our hypothesis, we studied excitatory events in PRG-1/LPA2–R−/− mice. fEPSPs evoked by Schaffer collateral stimulation in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 hippocampal region from double-deficient mice (n = 7) were not hyperexcitable in comparison to slices from WT litters (n = 3, paired t test for every fiber volley, p > 0.05), which was in contrast to findings in single PRG-1−/− animals (Figures 7F and 4A). On single-cell level, mEPSCs from CA1 pyramidal cells showed a significantly reduced frequency in PRG-1/LPA2–R−/− mice (n = 7, 1.60 ± 0.13 Hz) compared to that of PRG-1−/− mice (n = 8, 3.48 ± 0.22 Hz; student's t test: p < 0.001; Figure 7F), which was in the range of WT animals (see Figure 4C). These double-deficient animals showed neither reduced body weight during the postnatal phase nor seizure-like behavior or increased mortality around P21 as seen in PRG-1−/− mice (Figure S2A, S9). Finally, in vivo EEG-recordings revealed that, unlike single PRG-1 KO mice, double-deficient animals showed no signs of epileptic discharge around P21 (Figure 7G and Movie S3; n = 4). These experiments demonstrated that changes to hippocampal network excitability, increase in glutamatergic transmission and seizure activity are fully reverted in the absence of the LPA2-R. Our results show that deletion of the LPP-related molecule PRG-1 results in severe hippocampal overexcitability and leads to epileptic discharge in juvenile animals. This is due to a specific role of PRG-1 at the excitatory synapse on glutamatergic neurons, which appears to be dependent on the interaction between PRG-1 and lipid phosphates such as LPA, able to signal to presynaptic LPA2–receptors. These data indicate a scenario for the regulation of glutamatergic transmission controlled by PRG-1, which involves mechanisms mediated by bioactive lipids such as LPA and supplements the classical molecular machinery at the synapse. PRG-1 expression on dendrites is limited to glutamatergic neurons and reaches maximum levels in the third week of life (data not shown), a time when synaptogenesis peaks and neuronal connections are shaped. In parallel, expression of LPA2–receptors is high ("
https://openalex.org/W2142852316,"Torsten Roepke et al. show that the potassium channel subunit KCNE2—which previously has been most recognized for its role in controlling electrical activity in the heart—is important for normal thyroid function. KCNE2, together with its partner KCNQ1, is expressed in both mouse and human thyroid epithelial cells, and Kcne2 deficiency in mice leads to a constellation of defects resulting from decreased thyroid hormone biosynthesis. These results suggest new genetic links between thyroid and heart function. Thyroid dysfunction is a global health concern, causing defects including neurodevelopmental disorders, dwarfism and cardiac arrhythmia. Here, we show that the potassium channel subunits KCNQ1 and KCNE2 form a thyroid-stimulating hormone–stimulated, constitutively active, thyrocyte K+ channel required for normal thyroid hormone biosynthesis. Targeted disruption of Kcne2 in mice impaired thyroid iodide accumulation up to eightfold, impaired maternal milk ejection, halved milk tetraiodothyronine (T4) content and halved litter size. Kcne2-deficient mice had hypothyroidism, dwarfism, alopecia, goiter and cardiac abnormalities including hypertrophy, fibrosis, and reduced fractional shortening. The alopecia, dwarfism and cardiac abnormalities were alleviated by triiodothyronine (T3) and T4 administration to pups, by supplementing dams with T4 before and after they gave birth or by feeding the pups exclusively from Kcne2+/+ dams; conversely, these symptoms were elicited in Kcne2+/+ pups by feeding exclusively from Kcne2−/− dams. These data provide a new potential therapeutic target for thyroid disorders and raise the possibility of an endocrine component to previously identified KCNE2- and KCNQ1-linked human cardiac arrhythmias."

However, little is known about how they fold during or after this process due to the difficulty in detecting folding intermediates. Here we identify cotranslational and posttranslational folding intermediates of a periplasmic protein in which the protein and DsbA, a periplasmic disulfide bond-forming enzyme, are covalently linked by a disulfide bond. The cotranslational mixed-disulfide intermediate is, upon further chain elongation, resolved, releasing the oxidized polypeptide, thus allowing us to follow the folding process. This analysis reveals that two cysteines that are joined to form a structural disulfide can play different roles during the folding reaction and that the mode of translocation (cotranslational verse posttranslational) can affect the folding process of a protein in the periplasm. The latter finding leads us to propose that the activity of the ribosome (translation) can modulate protein folding even in an extracytosolic compartment.

Protein translocation across biological membranes.Science. 2005; 310: 1452-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In order for it to go through the channel, a protein must be maintained in an unfolded state (Liu et al., 1988Liu G.P. Topping T.B. Cover W.H. Randall L.L.

Disulfide bonds are generally introduced into exported proteins by members of the thioredoxin superfamily in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Kadokura et al., 2003Kadokura H. Katzen F. Beckwith J. Protein disulfide bond formation in prokaryotes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 111-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, Sevier and Kaiser, 2006Sevier C.S. Kaiser C.A. Conservation and diversity of the cellular disulfide bond formation pathways.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2006; 8: 797-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the periplasm of Escherichia coli, the formation of disulfide bonds is catalyzed by the protein DsbA, a thioredoxin superfamily member, which oxidizes substrates by donating its disulfide bond to a pair of cysteines on a substrate (Bardwell et al., 1991Bardwell J.C. McGovern K. Beckwith J. Identification of a protein required for disulfide bond formation in vivo.Cell. 1991; 67: 581-589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, Kamitani et al., 1992Kamitani S. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Identification and characterization of an Escherichia coli gene required for the formation of correctly folded alkaline phosphatase, a periplasmic enzyme.EMBO J. 1992; 11: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The process likely begins with the attack by a deprotonated cysteine of the substrate protein on the disulfide bond of DsbA, leading to a short-lived complex of DsbA and substrate linked together by an intermolecular disulfide bond (Figure 1A) (Kadokura et al., 2004Kadokura H. Tian H. Zander T. Bardwell J.C. Beckwith J. Snapshots of DsbA in action: detection of proteins in the process of oxidative folding.Science. 2004; 303: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Next, a deprotonated second cysteine of the substrate attacks the mixed-disulfide to resolve the complex, releasing oxidized substrate and reduced DsbA. Results obtained in vitro are consistent with this model (Darby and Creighton, 1995Darby N.J. Creighton T.E. Catalytic mechanism of DsbA and its comparison with that of protein disulfide isomerase.Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3576-3587Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, Frech et al., 1996Frech C. Wunderlich M. Glockshuber R. Schmid F.X. Preferential binding of an unfolded protein to DsbA.EMBO J. 1996; 15: 392-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, due to the difficulty of detecting the disulfide-linked enzyme-substrate complex, the process leading to formation of a disulfide bond in a folding protein via this complex has not been followed in vivo. Additionally, many questions remain about the mechanism of disulfide bond formation in vivo. We do not know how formation of disulfide bonds is coordinated with protein translocation and other folding processes. We also do not know which cysteines in substrates are used to form the intermediate mixed-disulfide complex with DsbA. We previously reported a mutation that generated a Pro151 to Thr change in DsbA, which slows down the resolution of covalent mixed-disulfide complexes between DsbA and its substrates and, thus, allows the detection of these intermediates (Kadokura et al., 2004Kadokura H. Tian H. Zander T. Bardwell J.C. Beckwith J. Snapshots of DsbA in action: detection of proteins in the process of oxidative folding.Science. 2004; 303: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Here we use this mutant and wild-type cells to follow the oxidative folding of a periplasmic protein in vivo. This approach enables us to (1) delineate the two steps of electron transfer that lead to the formation of a disulfide bond in a folding protein by a thioredoxin superfamily member (Figure 1A) and (2) specify the substrate cysteine that is used to form a disulfide-linked enzyme-substrate intermediate. Our results show that the two cysteines that form a structural disulfide bond can play different roles in the oxidative protein-folding reaction catalyzed by a thioredoxin superfamily member in vivo. Moreover, we provide evidence that the mode of translocation can affect the protein-folding process in this compartment. Our detection and characterization of the intermediates reveal novel features of protein folding in an extracytosolic compartment. To better understand the folding process in vivo, we used pulse-chase experiments to follow the time course and nature of the intermediates in disulfide bond formation in alkaline phosphatase (PhoA). PhoA is a homodimeric periplasmic protein with two intra-chain disulfide bonds, one between Cys168 and Cys178 and the other between Cys286 and Cys336 (Bradshaw et al., 1981Bradshaw R.A. Cancedda F. Ericsson L.H. Neumann P.A. Piccoli S.P. Schlesinger M.J. Shriefer K. Walsh K.A. Amino acid sequence of Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1981; 78: 3473-3477Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). PhoA is translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane by a mixed co- and posttranslational mechanism in which a substantial portion of the polypeptide chain is synthesized before protein translocation begins (Josefsson and Randall, 1981Josefsson L.G. Randall L.L. Different exported proteins in E. coli show differences in the temporal mode of processing in vivo.Cell. 1981; 25: 151-157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar; see also Figure S1, available online, for cotranslational and posttranslational translocation). To determine the oxidation (disulfide-bonded) status of PhoA at each time point, cultures were directly treated with acid to prevent any post-harvest oxidation of cysteines, and the free cysteines were alkylated with 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (AMS, 0.5 kDa). This modification retards the mobility of the reduced form of proteins on gels. Since the presumed intermediates of oxidative folding that form between DsbA and its substrates have never been detected before in wild-type cells, we first utilized the DsbA P151T mutant, which allows detection of such covalent intermediates (Kadokura et al., 2004Kadokura H. Tian H. Zander T. Bardwell J.C. Beckwith J. Snapshots of DsbA in action: detection of proteins in the process of oxidative folding.Science. 2004; 303: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To follow the oxidation of PhoA, cellular proteins were pulse-labeled with [35S]-methionine for 30 s at 30°C, chased for up to 10 min, and immunoprecipitated with anti-PhoA antibody. Immediately after the pulse, a small fraction (∼8%) of PhoA is in the oxidized form (Figure 1B, lane 7, oxi; see also Figure S2, lane 7). The remainder runs at (1) the positions of the reduced forms (red), (2) five positions representing complexes of apparently higher molecular weights than PhoA (asterisks), and (3) positions of possible nascent chains (upward arrow). Note that the reduced forms are observed at the positions of the reduced PhoA precursor still containing its signal sequence (faint upper band) and the reduced mature PhoA (lower band). After a 10 min chase, PhoA is largely converted to the oxidized form (Figure S2, lanes 7 to 12). We suggest that the five higher-molecular-weight bands (Figure 1B, lane 7, asterisks) represent disulfide-linked intermediates containing both DsbA and PhoA since these bands disappear when the samples are treated with reductant before electrophoresis (not shown, see also Figures 2A and 2B and related discussion on it), and both anti-DsbA and anti-PhoA antibodies precipitate them (Figure 1C). Importantly, these complexes were also detected in wild-type cells, although not appearing as prominently on gels because they were present in reduced amounts (Figure 1B, lanes 1 to 6; see also Figure 2B). Detection in vivo of a disulfide-linked complex between a thioredoxin superfamily member and its folding substrate is difficult (Appenzeller-Herzog and Ellgaard, 2008Appenzeller-Herzog C. Ellgaard L. In vivo reduction-oxidation state of protein disulfide isomerase: the two active sites independently occur in the reduced and oxidized forms.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2008; 10: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Indeed, the amounts of the complexes in wild-type cells indicated by the single asterisks are so small that it was necessary to slightly overexpose the film in Figure 1B for their detection. Nevertheless, these results show that the bands seen with the P151T mutant are not artifacts generated by the alteration of DsbA, confirming the mutant's utility in allowing their detection. As described above, previously DsbA-substrate complexes were only observed in cells with a mutant DsbA. Our results indicate that these complexes also exist in wild-type cells. We noticed that the smallest DsbA-PhoA complex, a diffuse “65 kDa” band (Figure 1B, double asterisk), behaves differently from the other complexes (single asterisk). Note that this complex appears to have a molecular weight lower than that predicted for a complex containing both full-length DsbA and full-length PhoA. The latter should run at a position corresponding to a molecular weight of about 71 kDa. In the presence of chloramphenicol, a peptide elongation inhibitor that freezes the polysome (Ennis, 1972Ennis H.L. Polysome metabolism in Escherichia coli: effect of antibiotics on polysome stability.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1972; 1: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), the four high-molecular-weight complexes disappeared during chase accompanied by a concomitant increase in the amount of oxidized PhoA (Figure 1B, lanes 13 to 18; Figure S2, lanes 13 to 18). However, the “65 kDa” complex persisted after the chase in the presence of the inhibitor (Figure 1B, lanes 13 to 18), indicating that ongoing peptide elongation is needed to resolve this complex. Surprisingly, during the chase in the presence of chloramphenicol, we observed an increase in the amount of the “65 kDa” complex (see also Figure 1D, lanes 1 to 5). The implication of this finding will be discussed later. To further characterize what portion of PhoA was present in the intermediates, we inserted a FLAG tag either at the N terminus of PhoA after the signal sequence cleavage site (PhoAss-FLAG-PhoA) or after the C terminus of the protein (PhoA-FLAG) (Figure S3). Anti-FLAG antibody can pull down nascent polypeptides from the N-terminally tagged but not the C-terminally tagged construct because nascent polypeptides have not completed synthesis of the C terminus. We found that the “65 kDa” complex was precipitated by anti-FLAG antibody only when we used the PhoAss-FLAG-PhoA (Figure 1D). This result, together with the previous finding that ongoing peptide elongation is needed to resolve the “65 kDa” complex, indicates that it is a complex between DsbA and PhoA nascent chains. In contrast, the other four higher-molecular-weight complexes were pulled down from both FLAG-tagged constructs (Figure 1D), indicating that they consisted of DsbA and full-length PhoA. To assess the nature of the PhoA in the intermediates, immunoprecipitates were separated by two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis in which the first dimension was nonreducing and the second reducing (note that, in Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 5, Figure 6, S5, and S6, we used the strain with wild-type DsbA). Each of the four high-molecular-weight complexes yielded a spot that represents the full-length mature PhoA (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2D, arrowhead), supporting the conclusion that they contained DsbA and full-length PhoA. In contrast, the reduced “65 kDa” complex yielded a faint but reproducible short streak around 43 kDa (Figures 2A, 2B and 2D, marked as “65-kDa” complex; see also Figure 5B). The apparent molecular mass of the complex (∼“65 kDa”) agrees well with the sum of the molecular masses of DsbA (21 kDa) and ∼43 kDa. Thus, PhoA forms a disulfide-linked complex with DsbA when the polypeptide has elongated to an approximate molecular mass of 43 kDa. The long diagonal line on the same 2D gel, ending at the position of the PhoA precursor (marked as “Reduced precursor”), represents elongating chains of PhoA (Figure 2), since no corresponding line is present when anti-FLAG antibody is used to precipitate PhoA from PhoA-FLAG (compare lane 1 with lane 6 in Figure 1D). From about 44 to 48 kDa, a streak appears above the diagonal line (Figures 2A, 2B, and 2D, arrow) resulting in a doubling of the line at this position. Our evidence indicates that this streak consists of nascent chains that contain a disulfide bond in the first nonreducing dimension causing them to move at a faster rate in the first dimension than non-disulfide-bonded PhoA chains of the same molecular weight. These chains then moved more slowly in the second dimension after they had been reduced. The greater gel mobility in the first dimension could be due to the compactness of the protein generated by the disulfide bond. This conclusion is supported by the following analysis of the effect of each of its two disulfide bonds on gel mobility of PhoA species. To determine which cysteine pair of PhoA (Cys168-Cys178 or Cys286-Cys336) is involved in the formation of the nascent intra-chain disulfide bond that generates the more slowly moving streak, we asked which of the two disulfide bonds affects mobility on gels in this way. Each of the two cysteine pairs was mutated separately to convert both of the cysteines to alanine and the oxidation of the nascent chains in these two species of PhoA was studied. We found that the appearance of the off-diagonal streak depended on the presence of the Cys286-Cys336 pair but not the Cys168-Cys178 pair (Figures 2C and 2D). This finding indicates that the formation of the intra-chain disulfide bond in nascent PhoA polypeptides affecting mobility on gels is due to the oxidation of the Cys286-Cys336 pair. These results also indicate that the Cys286-Cys336 disulfide bond starts to form when the polypeptide is elongated to 44 kDa. We also found that the absence of the Cys286-Cys336 pair led to the disappearance of the spot derived from the reduction of the “65 kDa” complex, indicating that this complex is one between DsbA and one cysteine of this pair of cysteines (Figures 2C and 2D). These results also suggest that the “65 kDa” complex is an intermediate that precedes the formation of the Cys286-Cys336 disulfide bond. We note that, when the chase was done in the presence of chloramphenicol, the disulfide bond seen in the streak above the diagonal line formed at slightly earlier stages of translation and did so more efficiently (Figures 2A and 2B). The formation of the “65 kDa” complex, as mentioned above, was also enhanced during the chase (Figure 1B, lanes 13 to 18 and Figure 1D, lanes 1 to 5). These findings can be most readily explained by assuming that the nascent chains could still undergo further translocation even though protein synthesis was blocked during the chase. In this way, the appropriate cysteines were exposed in the periplasm allowing formation of DsbA-PhoA complexes and of the carboxy-terminal disulfide bond. In fact, the enhanced accumulation of the “65 kDa” complex observed during the chase was largely diminished by azide, a translocation inhibitor (Oliver et al., 1990Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Jarosik G.P. Azide-resistant mutants of Escherichia coli alter the SecA protein, an azide-sensitive component of the protein export machinery.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) (Figure S4). Thus, the nascent chains underwent translation-uncoupled translocation into the periplasm during the chase period. The reduction of the Cys168-Cys178 disulfide did not change the migration of PhoA on gels (Figure S5A, lanes 5–6), consistent with a previous report (Sone et al., 1997bSone M. Kishigami S. Yoshihisa T. Ito K. Roles of disulfide bonds in bacterial alkaline phosphatase.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6174-6178Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This observation can explain why oxidation of this cysteine pair did not lead to a streak comparable to that seen with the Cys286-Cys336 pair on the 2D gel (Figure 2C). To allow visualization of nascent chains containing the Cys168-Cys178 disulfide bond, we caused alteration of its mobility on gels by performing an in-gel AMS alkylation step after AMS-alkylated proteins had been run on the first gel and treated with reductant. This step adds ∼0.5 kDa to each cysteine that had been involved in a disulfide bond, causing the originally oxidized chains to migrate more slowly on the second gel. With this new approach we were able to detect the oxidation of the first cysteine pair (Figure 3A). This oxidation occurred when the polypeptides were elongated to approximately 39 kDa (Figure 3A), not surprisingly an earlier point than that seen for the formation of the C-terminal disulfide bond, but at a considerably longer time after the cysteines had been incorporated into the protein. This finding is consistent with previous studies that showed that a considerable length of the PhoA polypeptide is made before translocation across the membrane begins (Josefsson and Randall, 1981Josefsson L.G. Randall L.L. Different exported proteins in E. coli show differences in the temporal mode of processing in vivo.Cell. 1981; 25: 151-157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We were unable to detect a DsbA-PhoA mixed-disulfide intermediate that leads to the formation of the Cys168-Cys178 disulfide bond (Figures 2C and 3A). We suppose that this intermediate is quite short-lived as the close proximity of these two cysteines should result in the mixed-disulfide with DsbA being immediately attacked by the closely following cysteine to resolve this complex and form the disulfide bond. This situation contrasts with that of the “65 kDa” complex where the two cysteines (Cys286 and Cys336) are separated by 49 amino acids. To further study the mechanism of formation of the C286-Cys336 disulfide bond, we analyzed the structure of the “65 kDa” DsbA-PhoA complex, using cysteine-to-alanine mutants of PhoA. Introduction of a C286A mutation into PhoA (Figure 4A, lanes 9–12), but not of a C336A mutation (lanes 5–8), prevented the formation of this intermediate. Thus, Cys286 of PhoA is the cysteine that attacks DsbA to form the “65 kDa” complex (Figure 4B). However, the C286A mutant also formed a complex, but it moved to around a 69 kDa position 4 kDa higher than the “65 kDa” complex. The 69 kDa complex is not seen when both Cys286 and 336 are present in PhoA. This finding indicates that Cys336 can attack DsbA in the absence of Cys286, but only when the polypeptide is elongated further to around 47 kDa. However, the predominance of the “65 kDa” complex when both Cys286 and Cys336 are present indicates that, with the native PhoA, Cys286 is normally used to attack DsbA to form the intermediate during translocation (see, for contrasting conditions, the section following the next one). In our pulse-chase experiments, a portion of PhoA is found as full-length precursor at early time points (e.g., “Reduced precursor” in Figures 2A and 5A). Since this precursor chases into mature PhoA, this species must have crossed the membrane posttranslationally (Figure S1A). This finding is consistent with previous reports that the processing of many secretory proteins, including PhoA, occurs both cotranslationally and posttranslationally in vivo (Josefsson and Randall, 1981Josefsson L.G. Randall L.L. Different exported proteins in E. coli show differences in the temporal mode of processing in vivo.Cell. 1981; 25: 151-157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To determine further whether the folding of a protein might be influenced by the mechanism of its export, we also caused PhoA to be exported predominantly by the cotranslational pathway (Tian and Bernstein, 2009Tian P. Bernstein H.D. Identification of a post-targeting step required for efficient cotranslational translocation of proteins across the Escherichia coli inner membrane.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 11396-11404Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We did this by replacing the signal sequence of PhoA with the signal sequences of SfmC and TorT (Figure S3), which utilize the signal recognition particle (SRP) pathway to direct cotranslational targeting of the protein to the translocation channel in contrast to the native PhoA signal sequence (Huber et al., 2005Huber D. Boyd D. Xia Y. Olma M.H. Gerstein M. Beckwith J. Use of thioredoxin as a reporter to identify a subset of Escherichia coli signal sequences that promote signal recognition particle-dependent translocation.J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2983-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In these experiments, consistent with a cotranslational initiation of protein export, we found no accumulation of the signal sequence-containing precursor of PhoA in the pulses (compare Figure 5A, lanes 5 to 8 and Figure S6A, lanes 1 to 4 with Figure 5A, lanes 1 to 4). Separation by 2D gel of the PhoA products from these variants shows that disulfide bond formation in these constructs occurs cotranslationally (Figures 5B and S6B), indicating the coupling of protein export and oxidative folding. Interestingly, we found that the continuation of protein export and oxidative folding seen with the PhoA signal sequence during the chase in the presence of chloramphenicol were absent when the SRP signal sequences were used (e.g., compare the “65 kDa” complex formation in Figure 1D, lanes 1 to 5 and Figure 5A, lanes 1 to 4 with that of Figure 5A, lanes 5 to 8). This finding suggests that when the SRP pathway is used, protein export and folding are tightly coupled to peptide elongation at least at late stages of translation. This finding is unexpected because, unlike mammalian SRP, bacterial SRP failed to exhibit “elongation arrest,” a mechanism to couple peptide elongation to protein translocation (Powers and Walter, 1997Powers T. Walter P. Co-translational protein targeting catalyzed by the Escherichia coli signal recognition particle and its receptor.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4880-4886Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Finally, we point out that, when we use SRP-dependent signal sequences for PhoA export, we observe the efficient formation of the “65 kDa” complex, which is followed by chain oxidation (Figure 5B). Up to this point, the high-molecular-weight disulfide-linked complexes formed between DsbA and the completed chains of PhoA remained a mystery. To gather further insight into the nature of these complexes, we used the same cysteine-to-alanine mutations described above to determine their disulfide bond connectivity. In contrast to the nascent-chain mixed-disulfide intermediate that was exclusively formed between DsbA and Cys286, the high-molecular-weight mixed-disulfide complexes included ones that used either Cys286 or Cs336 for the linkage with DsbA (Figure 4A, asterisks). To analyze the structure of these high-molecular-weight complexes, we purified them using a hexa-histidine tag fused to DsbA (Kadokura et al., 2004Kadokura H. Tian H. Zander T. Bardwell J.C. Beckwith J. Snapshots of DsbA in action: detection of proteins in the process of oxidative folding.Science. 2004; 303: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and a FLAG tag fused to PhoA. Upon analysis of the purified complexes by mass spectrometry, we detected tryptic fragments from DsbA and PhoA but not of any other protein (not shown), showing that they consist only of these two proteins. Since Cys33, the C-terminal cysteine of the CXXC active site of DsbA, is inaccessible to the surface of the protein, Cys30 should be the only cysteine available from DsbA for the mixed-disulfide formation with PhoA. On the other hand, from the PhoA mutant variants, only one cysteine (either Cys286 or Cys336) is available. Accordingly, the high-molecular-weight complexes are likely to include heterodimers of DsbA and the completed chain of PhoA linked by Cys30 of DsbA and either Cys286 or Cys336 of PhoA. It should be noted that the high-molecular-weight complexes migrated in gels differently in two ways. First, the high-molecular-weight complexes formed between DsbA and Cys336 of PhoA migrated faster than those formed between DsbA and Cys286 of PhoA (Figure 4A). This behavior can be explained by the fact that the rate of migration of denatured covalent complexes in gels does not depend only on the sum of the molecular weights of the components but also depends on the branch structure (Cho et al., 2007Cho S.H. Porat A. Ye J. Beckwith J. Redox-active cysteines of a membrane electron transporter DsbD show dual compartment accessibility.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 3509-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Second, the electrophoretic mobilities of two of the high-molecular-weight complexes (corresponding to calculated molecular weights of 130 kDa and 150 kDa) are much slower than those expected from the sum of the masses of DsbA and the full-length PhoA (∼71 kDa). Since such slowly migrating molecules were not observed for the nascent-chain mixed-disulfide intermediate, their appearance likely requires a step that occurs only after the synthesis of the C-terminal portion of PhoA. However, without further analysis, we cannot speculate on the nature of these unusual complexes. For study of the folding of PhoA that takes place during translation (cotranslational folding), it is possible to use the chain length as a timescale for the progression of event. However, the folding that takes place after translation is completed (posttranslational folding) lacks such a clear scale. This fact, in conju"

Although this process is likely to be tightly regulated, the relevant mechanisms that modulate its activity are unknown. Here we show that the antioxidant scavenger peroxiredoxin1 (Prdx1) interacts with GDE2, and that loss of Prdx1 causes motor neuron deficits analogous to GDE2 ablation. Prdx1 cooperates with GDE2 to drive motor neuron differentiation, and this synergy requires Prdx1 thiol-dependent catalysis. Prdx1 activates GDE2 through reduction of an intramolecular disulfide bond that bridges its intracellular N- and C-terminal domains. GDE2 variants incapable of disulfide bond formation acquire independence from Prdx1 and are potent inducers of motor neuron differentiation. These findings define Prdx1 as a pivotal regulator of GDE2 activity and suggest roles for coupled thiol-redox-dependent cascades in controlling neuronal differentiation in the spinal cord."

Eukaryotic cells consist of complex membrane-bounded compartments that are endowed with specific proteins. Among them, mitochondria are essential organelles and perform multiple functions ranging from energy generation to regulation of cell death. Mitochondria are estimated to consist of 1000–1500 different proteins, which represent 10–20% of proteins synthesized in eukaryotic cells. Because of the mitochondrial connection to several human diseases including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer, biogenesis and functional maintenance of mitochondria have gained widening interest, and efforts have been made to compile an extensive catalogue of the mitochondrial proteome (1.Meisinger C. Sickmann A. Pfanner N. Cell. 2008; 134: 22-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The vast majority of mitochondrial proteins are encoded by the nuclear DNA, synthesized in the cytosol, and imported into the mitochondria, whereas only a handful of them are encoded by the mitochondrial DNA. Precise targeting of mitochondrial proteins requires recognition of mitochondrial targeting signals (2.Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 3.Pfanner N. Geissler A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 4.Endo T.

Most of the proteins that go across the outer and inner membranes to reach the matrix or inner membrane are synthesized as precursor proteins with an N-terminal cleavable presequence that contains a mitochondrial targeting signal. Many polytopic inner membrane proteins including those of the carrier protein family lack a presequence but instead have a mitochondrial targeting signal in the mature part as an internal signal. Protein import into mitochondria is mediated by the translocators of the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes (5.Koehler C.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Current understanding is that different types of targeting signals are recognized by different receptors. In general, targeting signals contained in the cleavable presequences are recognized by Tom20 and Tom22, and internal targeting signals of polytopic membrane proteins are recognized by Tom70 (9.Lithgow T.

The structural analyses showed that the hydrophobic groove of Tom20 binds to the hydrophobic side of the eight-residue segment of the rat aldehyde dehydrogenase presequence, which appears to contain a five-residue motif as an element for Tom20 recognition, in the amphiphilic helical conformation (11.Abe Y.

It has been reported that Tom70 recognizes, in addition to presequence-less polytopic membrane proteins, some presequence-containing precursor proteins including cytochrome c1, alcohol dehydrogenase III, and the α- and β-subunits of F1-ATPase (Atp1p and Atp2p); yet the presequences did not appear to be the sole determinant of those presequence-containing precursors to Tom70 (14.Hines V. Brandt A. Griffiths G. Horstmann H. Brütsch H. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3191-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 15.Hines V. Schatz G. J. Biol.

The purified presequence-containing adrenodoxin precursor loaded onto the cytosolic chaperone mitochondrial import-stimulating factor was shown to bind to Tom70 first and then to Tom20 during its import into mitochondria in vitro (17.Chan N.C.

However, in contrast to Tom20, little is known about the recognition of the mitochondrial targeting signal by Tom70, although a peptide scan analysis showed that Tom70 binds to multiple segments throughout the polypeptide chain of noncleavable phosphate carrier (18.Brix J. Rüdiger S. Bukau B. Schneider-Mergener J. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16522-16530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Tom70 was also shown to function as a docking site for cytosolic chaperones such as Hsp70 (in yeast and mammals) and Hsp90 (mammals) to receive mitochondrial proteins (19.Young J.C. Hoogenraad N.J. Hartl F.U. Cell. 2003; 112: 41-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In the present study, we took a proteome-wide approach of mitochondrial protein import in vitro to find a set of substrate proteins for recognition by Tom70. Translation products of total yeast RNA were imported into isolated wild type mitochondria and those without Tom70. Comparison of the imported proteins on two-dimensional electrophoresis gels between wild type and tom70Δ mitochondria allowed us to identify presequence-containing proteins affected by depletion of Tom70 systematically. Then we tried to elucidate the reason for the requirement of Tom70 for the import of the identified presequence-containing mitochondrial precursor proteins. The obtained results show that Tom70 is not required for targeting signal recognition but instead for maintenance of the solubility of the presequence-containing precursor proteins. The yeast haploid strain W303-1A was used as a parental strain in this study. To construct the tom70Δ strain (MNA-mas70), the chromosomal TOM70 gene was disrupted with the URA3 marker. MNA-mas70 was transformed with the TRP1 plasmid pRS314/Tom70(WT), pRS314/Tom70(38TEV), pRS314/Tom70(98TEV), and pRS314/Tom70(246) to construct yeast strains Tom70W, Tom70T, Tom70T(98), and Tom70T(246), respectively.

Mitochondria were isolated from W303-1A (WT) and MNA-mas70 (tom70Δ) strains grown in lactate medium at 30 °C. Radiolabeled precursor proteins were synthesized with rabbit reticulocyte lysate by coupled transcription/translation in the presence of [35S]methionine. WT or tom70Δ mitochondria (0.1 mg protein/ml) were incubated with radiolabeled precursor proteins in import buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2, 80 mm KCl, 2 mm potassium Pi, 2 mm methionine, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm NADH, 1% BSA) at 25 °C. The import reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μg/ml valinomycin. Protease treatment was performed by incubating the mitochondria with 100 μg/ml proteinase K for 20 min on ice, which was inactivated by subsequent addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation and washed once with SEM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2), and the proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and radioimaging with a Storm 860 image analyzer (Amersham Biosciences). Most import experiments were performed at least twice for different preparation of mitochondria to confirm reproducibility and independence of different mitochondrial preparation. Yeast wild type cells (W303-1A) were grown in lactate medium to logarithmic phase, washed with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water, and resuspended in TES buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS). An equal volume of water-saturated phenol solution was added to the suspension, and the mixture was incubated at 65 °C for 45 min with occasional vortexing. After centrifugation, the aqueous phase was recovered and extracted twice with chloroform, and then total RNAs were precipitated by ethanol precipitation. The cytosolic domain (residues 39–617) of Tom70 with the C-terminal His10 tag (Tom70d) was overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) using the vector pET-16b (Novagen), and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid and Mono-Q 5/50 columns. Radiolabeled proteins were synthesized with PURESYSTEM by coupled transcription/translation in the presence of [35S]methionine at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction mixture contained no additional protein, 5 μm Tom70d, or 5 μm BSA. The translation products were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. To perform a global search for substrate proteins for Tom70 recognition in mitochondrial protein import, we isolated total RNA from wild type yeast cells, which was used for in vitro translation in the presence of [35S]Met with reticulocyte lysate. The mixture of radiolabeled proteins was then subjected to in vitro import analyses with mitochondria from WT cells and those from tom70-deletion mutant cells (tom70Δ). To analyze the roles of receptors by mitochondrial import assays, experimental conditions should be optimized to make the receptor-mediated step rate-limiting in the import process (10.Yamano K. Yatsukawa Y. Esaki M. Hobbs A.E. Jensen R.E. Endo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3799-3807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 20.Lithgow T. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14267-14269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We thus lowered the concentrations of mitochondria to the range that rendered the import rate of ADP/ATP carrier (AAC), a presequence-less substrate for the Tom70 recognition, dependent on the concentrations of mitochondria. Under this condition, import of AAC into tom70Δ mitochondria was retarded as compared with that into WT mitochondria (data not shown). We adopted this condition of mitochondrial concentrations (≤0.25 mg of protein/ml) for the import of the translation products of total yeast RNA into WT and tom70Δ mitochondria at 25 °C for 5 min. After the import reaction, the mitochondria were treated with protease to remove proteins outside mitochondria, reisolated by centrifugation, and solubilized with 2% CHAPS, 7 m urea, and 2 m thiourea. The protease-protected, presumably imported proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with denaturing IEF in the first dimension and SDS-PAGE in the second dimension and were detected by radioimaging (Fig. 1A). When valinomycin, which dissipates the membrane potential (ΔΨ) across the inner membrane, was added before incubation of the translation products with mitochondria, most of the spots disappeared, suggesting that they represent proteins that require ΔΨ for import (data not shown). In total, as many as 114 spots of the imported proteins were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis under four different conditions (supplemental Fig. S1). When we compare the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis patterns of imported proteins between WT mitochondria and tom70Δ mitochondria, we find several spots exhibiting lower intensities with tom70Δ mitochondria than with WT mitochondria. Four typical examples, spots 3, 9, 13, and 22, are shown in Fig. 1A. The resolved 114 spots were thus quantified and compared between WT mitochondria and tom70Δ mitochondria (Fig. 1B). Intensities of spots 3, 6, 9, 13, 22, 30, 41, 67, 71, 72, 73, 82, 83, 90, 91, 102, and 109 for tom70Δ mitochondria were <75% of those for WT mitochondria. These spots represent proteins whose import into mitochondria was strongly affected by deletion of the TOM70 gene. Interestingly, some proteins corresponding to spots 21, 74, and 86 were more efficiently (> 2-fold) imported into tom70Δ mitochondria than into WT mitochondria. We confirmed that the levels of Tom20, Tom40, or Tom71, a minor isoform of Tom70, did not change in tom70Δ mitochondria (supplemental Fig. S2). Perhaps an unknown adaptation may have been caused by deletion of the TOM70 gene as previously observed for deletion of Tom20 (21.Lithgow T. Junne T. Wachter C. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15325-15330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This point will be discussed later. For identification of the spots in the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis radioimaging, we compared them with those in the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis maps for proteins associated with isolated yeast mitochondria, 6K. Terao, H. Yamamoto, M. Uchida, S. Kitamura, S. Nishikawa, and T. Endo, unpublished results. where ∼90 different protein spots were assigned to specific yeast proteins by in-gel trypsin digestion followed by mass spectrometry measurements. By referring to even this limited information on the two-dimensional gel electrophoresis maps, we could find possible candidates for the proteins whose import appeared to depend on Tom70. We thus tentatively assigned spots 3, 6, 9, 13, 67, 73, 82, and 102 to specific mitochondrial proteins, Atp2p (F1-ATPase β-subunit), Tom40, Ssc1p (mitochondrial Hsp70), Dld2p (d-lactase dehydrogenase), Cit1p (citrate synthase), Atp1p (F1-ATPase α-subunit), Aco1 (mitochondrial aconitase), and Idh1 (isocitrate dehydrogenase), respectively. Among these eight proteins, only Atp1p and Atp2p were previously reported to depend on Tom70 for their import (14.Hines V. Brandt A. Griffiths G. Horstmann H. Brütsch H. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3191-3200Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Except for Tom40, these proteins are synthesized as precursors with a cleavable N-terminal presequence. It is to be noted under the present conditions of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis that most of the known presequence-less substrates for Tom70 such as AAC and other inner membrane carrier proteins are too hydrophobic to be resolved in the two-dimensional gel (data not shown). To further confirm the above assignments, we performed in vitro import of the assigned mitochondrial proteins into WT mitochondria and tom70Δ mitochondria individually. The assigned proteins were synthesized in vitro with reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]Met, and radiolabeled proteins were imported into WT mitochondria and tom70Δ mitochondria. As a control, pSu9-DHFR, a fusion protein between the presequence of subunit 9 of Neurospora crassa Fo-ATPase (pSu9) and mouse DHFR, which does not require Tom70 for import, was imported with similar or slightly higher efficiency into tom70Δ mitochondria than WT mitochondria (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, precursors of Aco1p (pAco1p), Atp1p (pAtp1p), Cit1p (pCit1p), and Idh1p (pIdh1p) were imported into tom70Δ mitochondria with lower efficiency than into WT mitochondria, whereas import rates of precursors to Atp2p (pAtp2p) and Dld2p (pDld2p) into tom70Δ mitochondria were similar to those imported into WT mitochondria (Fig. 2B). The different Tom70 dependence between pAtp1p and pAtp2p may be due to the difference in the presequence lengths or properties (e.g. isoeletric points) of the mature domains. Therefore we judge that at least four proteins, pAco1p, pAtp1p, pCit1p, and pIdh1p, are presequence-containing mitochondrial precursor proteins that require Tom70 for their import into mitochondria. Does Tom70 recognize the presequence or mature part of the identified Tom70-dependent presequence-containing precursor proteins (pX, where pX is the full-length precursor to protein X)? To address this question, we tested the Tom70 dependence in the import of the fusion proteins (pX(5)-DHFR) between the presequence of pX (plus five residues in the mature domain carrying the presequence cleavage site) and a nonmitochondrial protein DHFR as a passenger domain. As controls, the pX-DHFR fusion proteins consisting of the full-length precursor proteins (pAco1p, pAtp1p, pCit1p, pDld2p, pIdh1p, and pAtp2p) and DHFR were imported efficiently into mitochondria (Fig. 3A). Import of pAco1p-DHFR, pAtp1p-DHFR, pCit1p-DHFR, and pIdh1p-DHFR (like pAco1p, pAtp1p, pCit1p, and pIdh1p) depended on Tom70, whereas that of pDld2p-DHFR or pAtp2p-DHFR (like pDld2p or pAtp2p) did not depend on Tom70. Now the DHFR fusion proteins with a presequence of the Tom70-dependent precursors, pAco1p, pAtp1p, pCit1p, and pIdh1p (pAco1(5)-DHFR, pAtp1(5)-DHFR, pCit1(5)-DHFR, and pIdh1(5)-DHFR, respectively) were hardly or inefficiently imported into mitochondria (note that the scales for y axes differ for different charts). On the other hand, pDld2(5)-DHFR and pAtp2(5)-DHFR were imported into mitochondria more efficiently than corresponding full-length fusion proteins, pDld2p-DHFR and pAtp2p-DHFR (Fig. 3B). The impaired import of pAco1(5)-DHFR, pAtp1(5)-DHFR, pCit1(5)-DHFR, and pIdh1(5)-DHFR was not due to aggregate formation or sequestering of the presequence in the DHFR part (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). The mature parts of pAco1p, pAtp1p, pCit1p, or pIdh1p lacking the presequence were not imported into WT or tom70Δ mitochondria at all (data not shown). Because tight folding of the DHFR domain may well hamper efficient import into mitochondria, we tested the import of fusion proteins containing the mature domains of authentic mitochondrial precursor proteins of Cox4p (pCox4p, cytochrome oxidase subunit IV) and Hsp60 (pHsp60), which are more susceptible to protease digestion than DHFR (supplemental Fig. S4). Although pX(5)-Cox4p fusion proteins with the presequence of pAco1p, pAtp1p, pCit1p, or pIdh1p were still hardly or not imported into mitochondria (supplemental Fig. S5), the fusion proteins pX(5)-Hsp60 with any of the six presequences (pAco1(5)-Hsp60, pAtp1(5)-Hsp60, pCit1(5)-Hsp60, pDld2(5)-Hsp60, pIdh1(5)-Hsp60, and pAtp2(5)-Hsp60) were imported into mitochondria (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the presequences of pAco1p, pAtp1p, pCit1p, pDld2p, pIdh1p, and pAtp2p have sufficient information to target passenger proteins to mitochondria. The low ability of those presequences to direct tightly folded DHFR domain to mitochondria is likely due to their short lengths (23, 42, 37, 44, 29, and 32 residues long for pAco1p, pAtp1p, pCit1p, pDld2p, pIdh1p, and pAtp2, respectively), because presequences shorter than ∼70 residues cannot engage with mitochondrial Hsp70 in the matrix without prior unfolding of the mature domains (22.Matouschek A.

On the other hand, because the N-terminal 69 residues of the mature part of pHsp60 appear protease-susceptible and -labile (supplemental Fig. S4), even the short presequences (23–44 residues) can reach the matrix without unfolding of the core part of the mature domain of pHsp60, so that import efficiency of pX(5)-Hsp60 became high. The different import efficiency between the pX(5)-Cox4p fusion proteins and pX(5)-Hsp60 fusion proteins may reflect a difference in the folding status between Cox4p and Hsp60p, as indicated by the moderate protease resistance of pCox4p as compared with highly protease-sensitive pHsp60 (supplemental Fig. S4). It is to be noted that the pX(5)-Hsp60 fusion proteins tend to be imported into tom70Δ mitochondria more efficiently than WT mitochondria (Fig. 4A). This unexpected observation could reflect secondary effects or adaptation caused by deletion of the TOM70 gene because some mitochondrial proteins were imported into tom70Δ mitochondria more efficiently than into WT mitochondria in our initial screening as well (Fig. 1B).

https://openalex.org/W2044904363,"Heterochromatin plays a key role in protection of chromosome integrity by suppressing homologous recombination. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Sir2p, Sir3p, and Sir4p are structural components of heterochromatin found at telomeres and the silent mating-type loci. Here we have investigated whether incorporation of Sir proteins into minichromosomes regulates early steps of recombinational repair in vitro. We find that addition of Sir3p to a nucleosomal substrate is sufficient to eliminate yRad51p-catalyzed formation of joints, and that this repression is enhanced by Sir2p/Sir4p. Importantly, Sir-mediated repression requires histone residues that are critical for silencing in vivo. Moreover, we demonstrate that the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling enzyme facilitates joint formation by evicting Sir3p, thereby promoting subsequent Rad54p-dependent formation of a strand invasion product. These results suggest that recombinational repair in the context of heterochromatin presents additional constraints that can be overcome by ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1988141599,"The tumour suppressor PTEN can inhibit cell proliferation and migration as well as control cell growth, in different cell types. PTEN functions predominately as a lipid phosphatase, converting PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) to PtdIns(4,5)P(2), thereby antagonizing PI(3)K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and its established downstream effector pathways. However, much is unclear concerning the mechanisms that regulate PTEN movement to the cell membrane, which is necessary for its activity towards PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) (Refs 3, 4, 5). Here we show a requirement for functional motor proteins in the control of PI3K signalling, involving a previously unknown association between PTEN and myosinV. FRET (Förster resonance energy transfer) measurements revealed that PTEN interacts directly with myosinV, which is dependent on PTEN phosphorylation mediated by CK2 and/or GSK3. Inactivation of myosinV-transport function in neurons increased cell size, which, in line with known attributes of PTEN-loss, required PI(3)K and mTor. Our data demonstrate a myosin-based transport mechanism that regulates PTEN function, providing new insights into the signalling networks regulating cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2003596021,"The L-type calcium channel (LTCC) has a variety of physiological roles that are critical for the proper function of many cell types and organs. Recently, a member of the zinc-regulating family of proteins, ZnT-1, was recognized as an endogenous inhibitor of the LTCC, but its mechanism of action has not been elucidated. In the present study, using two-electrode voltage clamp recordings in Xenopus oocytes, we demonstrate that ZnT-1-mediated inhibition of the LTCC critically depends on the presence of the LTCC regulatory β-subunit. Moreover, the ZnT-1-induced inhibition of the LTCC current is also abolished by excess levels of the β-subunit. An interaction between ZnT-1 and the β-subunit, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and by fluorescence resonance energy transfer, is consistent with this result. Using surface biotinylation and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy in HEK293 cells, we show a ZnT-1-dependent decrease in the surface expression of the pore-forming α1-subunit of the LTCC. Similarly, a decrease in the surface expression of the α1-subunit is observed following up-regulation of the expression of endogenous ZnT-1 in rapidly paced cultured cardiomyocytes. We conclude that ZnT-1-mediated inhibition of the LTCC is mediated through a functional interaction of ZnT-1 with the LTCC β-subunit and that it involves a decrease in the trafficking of the LTCC α1-subunit to the surface membrane.

https://openalex.org/W2168473498,"We report that N-linked oligosaccharide structures can be present on an asparagine residue not adhering to the consensus site motif NX(S/T), where X is not proline, described in the literature. We have observed oligosaccharides on a non-consensus asparaginyl residue in the C(H)1 constant domain of IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies. The initial findings were obtained from characterization of charge variant populations evident in a recombinant human antibody of the IgG2 subclass. HPLC-MS results indicated that cation-exchange chromatography acidic variant populations were enriched in antibody with a second glycosylation site, in addition to the well documented canonical glycosylation site located in the C(H)2 domain. Subsequent tryptic and chymotryptic peptide map data indicated that the second glycosylation site was associated with the amino acid sequence TVSWN(162)SGAL in the C(H)1 domain of the antibody. This highly atypical modification is present at levels of 0.5-2.0% on most of the recombinant antibodies that have been tested and has also been observed in IgG1 antibodies derived from human donors. Site-directed mutagenesis of the C(H)1 domain sequence in a recombinant-human IgG1 antibody resulted in an increase in non-consensus glycosylation to 3.15%, a greater than 4-fold increase over the level observed in the wild type, by changing the -1 and +1 amino acids relative to the asparagine residue at position 162. We believe that further understanding of the phenomenon of non-consensus glycosylation can be used to gain fundamental insights into the fidelity of the cellular glycosylation machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1979649494,"The role of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1/Flt1) in tumor metastasis remains incompletely characterized. Recent reports suggested that blocking VEGFR1 activity or the interaction with its ligands (VEGF and PlGF) has anti-tumor effects. Moreover, several studies showed that VEGFR1 mediates tumor progression to distant metastasis. All these effects may be exerted indirectly by recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs), such as myeloid cells. We investigated the role of VEGFR1 activity in BMDCs during the pre-metastatic phase, i.e., prior to metastatic nodule formation in mice after surgical removal of the primary tumor. Using pharmacologic blockade or genetic deletion of the tyrosine kinase domain of VEGFR1, we demonstrate that VEGFR1 activity is not required for the infiltration of de novo myeloid BMDCs in the pre-metastatic lungs in two tumor models and in two mouse models. Moreover, in line with emerging clinical observations, we show that blockade of VEGFR1 activity neither prevents nor changes the rate of spontaneous metastasis formation after primary tumor removal. Prevention of metastasis will require further identification and exploration of cellular and molecular pathways that mediate the priming of the metastatic soil."

Bacteria, except photosynthetic groups, usually lack intracellular membrane organelles. Strong overexpression in Escherichia coli of a foreign monotopic glycosyltransferase (named monoglycosyldiacylglycerol synthase), synthesizing a nonbilayer-prone glucolipid, induced massive formation of membrane vesicles in the cytoplasm.

IntroductionBacteria have well defined membrane and envelope ultrastructures, where changes during cell division, for example, are orchestrated by a range of proteins interacting sequentially in a coordinated manner. Gram-negative species, like Escherichia coli, have no internal membranes but only the inner and outer membranes on each side of the enclosing peptidoglycan layer. In contrast, photosynthetic species like Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (1.Liberton M. Howard Berg R. Heuser J. Roth R. Pakrasi H.B.

We report here that overexpression of a foreign lipid glycosyltransferase (GT) 4The abbreviations used are: GTglycosyltransferasealMGSmonoglucosyldiacylglycerol synthase from A. laidlawiialDGSdiglucosyldiacylglycerol synthase from A. laidlawiiGlcDAGmonoglucosyl-diacylglycerolTEMtransmission electron microscopyIMinner membraneOMouter membranePEphosphatidylethanolaminePGphosphatidylglycerolCLcardiolipin (diphosphatidylglycerol)DTTdithiothreitolBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidTEAtriethanolamine. can yield massive formation of membrane vesicles in the cytoplasm of E. coli, which seems coupled to the sequence and structural features of this GT enzyme.Induction of internal membrane systems in E. coli have occasionally been observed before for a handful of proteins in connection with routine overexpression, but not to the same extent as here, and in no instance were the molecular mechanisms for this analyzed or understood. First, overexpression of a few endogenous integral membrane proteins, i.e. the fumarate reductase (4.Weiner J.H. Lemire B.D. Elmes M.L. Bradley R.D. Scraba D.G. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 590-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), complete ATP synthase (5.von Meyenburg K. Jørgensen B.B. van Deurs B.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), the mannitol permease MtlA (7.van Weeghel R.P. Keck W. Robillard G.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), induce the formation of membrane stacks or tubules in the cytoplasm, close to and continuous with the inner (cytoplasmic) membrane. Some of these proteins may also rely on the integral YidC chaperon for membrane integration (10.Price C.E. Driessen A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 26921-26927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Second, overexpression of some “foreign” membrane proteins, such as certain viral ones (11.Armour G.A. Brewer G.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1488-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 12.Weber S. Granzow H. Weiland F. Marquardt O. Virus Genes. 1996; 12: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) or an alkane hydroxylase (13.Nieboer M. Vis A.J. Witholt B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), can yield analogous features. Third, deletion mutants for a number of proteins in cell division (14.Allison D.P. J.

Bacteriol. 1970; 102: 240-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) can induce formation of a few membrane vesicles, membrane stacks, or whorls. In addition, E. coli like many other Gram-negative bacteria can form and shed to the surroundings vesicles from their outer membranes (19.Kim J.Y. Doody A.M. Chen D.J. Cremona G.H. Shuler M.L.

Geobiology. 2008; 6: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).In eukaryotic cells, a number of dedicated endogenous proteins seem to be able to increase membrane curvature and curl up intracellular membranes to tubules and vesicles (21.Drin G. Morello V. Casella J.F. Gounon P. Antonny B. Science. 2008; 320: 670-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 22.Hu J. Shibata Y. Voss C. Shemesh T. Li Z. Coughlin M. Kozlov M.M. Rapoport T.A.

A foreign bacterial (Shiga) toxin can achieve similar features (24.Römer W. Berland L. Chambon V. Gaus K. Windschiegl B. Tenza D. Aly M.R. Fraisier V. Florent J.C. Perrais D. Lamaze C. Raposo G. Steinem C. Sens P. Bassereau P. Johannes L. Nature. 2007; 450: 670-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The mechanisms seem to involve a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions by certain segments in the responsible proteins, sometimes in combination with an arc shape of the protein like in Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs domain ones. Penetration of hydrophobic segments into the bilayer and lipid molecular packing shapes can also be involved (25.Campelo F. McMahon H.T. Kozlov M.M. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 2325-2339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Finally, a large number of “bioactive” peptides may yield analogous morphological membrane changes in both cells and liposome systems, e.g. temporins, penetratin, and polyarginines (26.Domanov Y.A. Kinnunen P.K. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 4427-4439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 27.Lamazière A. Burlina F. Wolf C. Chassaing G. Trugnan G. Ayala-Sanmartin J. PLoS One. 2007; 2: e201Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).The morphology and macroscopic curvature of a biological membrane should be determined by several intrinsic and complex factors, like the dynamic packing geometries and charge of the various lipids constituting the liquid-crystalline bilayer, the geometries of all the integral, much stiffer proteins, the extent of long range protein-protein binding, the weight fractions of lipids and proteins in the membrane, and the transmembrane asymmetries of the latter components. Extrinsic factors like a cytoskeleton can also be involved, but this seems not the case in bacteria. However, the high osmotic concentrations in many bacteria yield a turgor pressure keeping the inner membrane tight against the surrounding peptidoglycan mesh. The spontaneous curvature of the lipid bilayer in E. coli, given by the lipid packing shapes and dominated by the nonbilayer-prone phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), should be negative according to the established phase equilibria (28.Morein S. Andersson A. Rilfors L. Lindblom G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6801-6809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and may facilitate vesicle formation. Likewise, cardiolipin (CL), with a large intrinsic curvature, is enriched in the two curved cell pole cap regions (29.Huang K.C. Mukhopadhyay R. Wingreen N.S. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2006; 2: 1357-1364Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 30.Mukhopadhyay R. Huang K.C. Wingreen N.S. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 1034-1049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).In the small bacterium Acholeplasma laidlawii, the bilayer spontaneous curvature is extensively regulated by two closely related lipid GTs, consecutively synthesizing one nonbilayer-prone and one bilayer-forming glucolipid (31.Wieslander A. Christiansson A. Rilfors L. Lindblom G. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3650-3655Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These two enzymes are both monotopic, i.e. anchored in the membrane cytoplasmic interface by hydrophobic and charge interactions (32.Li L. Storm P. Karlsson O.P. Berg S. Wieslander A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9677-9686Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We recently discovered that the “first” GT enzyme monoglucosyldiacylglycerol synthase (alMGS), for the nonbilayer glucolipid α-glucosyl-diacylglycerol (GlcDAG) synthesis, can be overproduced in E. coli to an extent rarely seen for other membrane proteins (33.Eriksson H.M. Persson K. Zhang S. Wieslander K. Protein Expr. Purif. 2009; 66: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We report here that this is accompanied by a massive formation of small intracellular membrane vesicles in E. coli, yielding more cytoplasmic membranes than observed for any other protein or condition, cf. above. Similar features were recorded for the “second” lipid GT diglucosyldiacylglycerol synthase (alDGS) and an inactive alMGS mutant. Furthermore, on the basis of structural features for the alMGS and alDGS proteins, we suggest potential general mechanisms for this membrane reorganization phenomenon.DISCUSSIONFormation of Intracellular MembranesThe large amounts of the alMGS protein synthesized, in combination with its sequence and structural properties, must be the reason for the extensive membrane vesicle formation, reaching higher levels than observed for other proteins in E. coli causing occasional formation of extra membranes. A key factor for incorporation of overexpressed integral membrane proteins in the membrane is sufficient amounts of the SecYEG translocon and associated chaperons. However, the monotopic alMGS and alDGS proteins are anchored in the IM cytoplasmic interface, without passing the translocon. Another factor is spatial requirements; more lipid bilayer is needed to accommodate large amounts of new proteins. The type and properties of the lipids may also be important, especially for heterologous membrane proteins. Four partially overlapping mechanisms for how heterologous or endogenous proteins can expand and/or “bend” membranes in E. coli cells, eventually leading to formation of closed intracellular membrane compartments, e.g. membrane vesicles (“vesiculation”) on a large scale, can be suggested as follows.Packing Shapes of Transmembrane ProteinsCertain protein complexes have extending cytoplasmic domains that are substantially larger (space-demanding) laterally than their smaller transmembrane parts. This is very evident for a handful of E. coli proteins causing formation of extra cytoplasmic membranes upon overexpression, i.e. the FtsY-receptor-ribosome complex (9.Herskovits A.A. Shimoni E. Minsky A. Bibi E. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the complete ATP synthase (5.von Meyenburg K. Jørgensen B.B. van Deurs B. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 1791-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the fumarate-reductase complex (4.Weiner J.H. Lemire B.D. Elmes M.L. Bradley R.D. Scraba D.G. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 158: 590-596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the chemotaxis Tsr receptor, the MtlA permease (7.van Weeghel R.P. Keck W. Robillard G.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 2613-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and the ATP synthase b-subunit (6.Arechaga I. Miroux B. Karrasch S. Huijbregts R. de Kruijff B. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), listed here in order of decreasing size/volume for the extruding cytoplasmic domain(s). All of these do use the SecYEG translocon for integration, and some also use the chaperon YidC (50.Kol S. Nouwen N. Driessen A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 31269-31273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). For these proteins, the larger space demands of the extruding part, in relation to the transmembrane part (cf. Fig. 7, schematic), should be a major cause for the membrane to bend, invaginate, and potentially also to pinch off from the E. coli inner membrane.The eukaryotic proteins cytochrome b5 and PMA2/PMA1 ATPases also seem to conform to this principle of bulkiness and formation of extra membranes upon overexpression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (51.Vergères G. Yen T.S. Aggeler J. Lausier J. Waskell L. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 249-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52.Supply P. Wach A. Thinès-Sempoux D. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19744-19752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mitochondria, dimer formation of the many bulky ATP synthases (cf. above) may be involved in the bending of cristae membranes (53.Vonck J. Schäfer E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Likewise, controlled dimerization of artificial membrane proteins in mammalian tissue culture cells caused the generation of cubic, highly curved membranes in the endoplasmic reticulum (54.Lingwood D. Schuck S. Ferguson C. Gerl M.J. Simons K. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 12041-12048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).In an analogous manner, transmembrane proteins where the integral part (in the membrane) is much more bulky inside one of the monolayers, compared with the other monolayer, and with no or very small protruding parts, and hence effectively hydrophobic “wedges” (or “cones”), should also cause membrane bending and potential vesiculation. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed effects of such “'wedge” proteins have not been reported, but it may be valid for certain membrane channels and transporters having this shape.Interface-interacting ProteinsSeveral monotopic membrane proteins also induce membrane formation, like the E. coli glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase PlsB (8.Wilkison W.O. Walsh J.P. Corless J.M. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 9951-9958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the peptidoglycan precursor glycosyltransferase MurG with an established structure (39.Ha S. Walker D. Shi Y. Walker S.

For PlsB, fold recognition (at the Meta Server), as described before (34.Berg S. Edman M. Li L. Wikström M. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22056-22063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), yielded a partial similarity to a squash glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase structure (data not shown). These are all localized on the cytoplasmic monolayer of the inner membrane in E. coli, and they do not use the Sec translocon. Furthermore, they are all devoid of transmembrane segments but have several segments intercalating into the bilayer interface according to MPEx analyses (data not shown), where hydrophobicity is predicted based upon experimental thermodynamic principles.Furthermore, the anchor segments of all these monotopic proteins, and in the archetypal monotopic membrane protein prostaglandin H2 synthase-1 (56.Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar), span a similar range of ΔG values for interface association (data not shown). These monotopic proteins will expand the inner monolayer upon incorporation at sufficient amounts, prevent transmembrane protein localization in the corresponding (juxta-positioned) outer monolayer area, and eventually cause convex bending and vesicle pinching.A natural system with highly curved membranes of small dimensions is the prolamellar body in dark-grown plants and normal seed shoots, eventually transformed to the chloroplast thylakoids upon metabolic greening by light. Here, large amounts of a monotopic dimer for the enzyme protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (with a Rossmann fold, according to our Meta Server prediction) seem to be involved in formation/maintenance of the cubic three-dimensional organization in these strongly lipid-enriched membranes (57.Selstam E. Lipids in Photosynthesis: Structure, Function and Genetics.in: Siegenthaler P.A. Murata N. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 209-224Google Scholar, 58.Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Hence, Rossmann fold proteins only penetrating the membrane interfaces, like alMGS, alDGS, and MurG, may achieve an analogous curvature modification of membranes when present in large amounts.Positive Charges at the InterfaceSome of the proteins are also characterized by having a substantial number of positively charged amino acids (Lys and Arg) close to the membrane interface (e.g. PlsB, ATP-b, MurG, and especially alMGS). It is well established that in peripheral and integral proteins, these residues can bind to anionic phospholipids like PG and CL, especially when occurring as pairs in the sequence (59.Epand R.F. Tokarska-Schlattner M. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Epand R.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 968-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 60.Marius P. Zagnoni M. Sandison M.E. East J.M. Morgan H. Lee A.G. Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 1689-1698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Lys and Arg are also common in the interface regions of typical monotopic membrane proteins, e.g. prostaglandin H2 synthase-1 (56.Picot D. Loll P.J. Garavito R.M. Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar), signal peptide peptidase (61.Kim A.C. Oliver D.C. Paetzel M. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 376: 352-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (62.Yeh J.I. Chinte U. Du S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 3280-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Of the three monotopic proteins here with very similar three-dimensional structures (i.e. alMGS, alDGS, and MurG), alMGS is by far the most efficient vesiculation protein. alMGS has a substantially larger number of Lys and Arg residues than the others (61 residues), and only one Trp, whereas MurG has 36 Lys/Arg and 8 Trp. The bulkier Arg is also more frequent in MurG compared with alMGS (see Fig. 8 schematic for a comparison of surface charges). Intriguingly, it was recently reported from a molecular dynamics comparison of a dozen monotopic membrane proteins that the more Lys and Arg residues and to some extent His, in addition to hydrophobic ones in the binding surfaces, the deeper into the bilayer the proteins seem able to penetrate, potentially even reaching anionic phospholipids in the opposite monolayer (63.Balali-Mood K. Bond P.J. Sansom M.S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 2135-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). His is frequently found interacting with phospholipid headgroups in membrane protein three-dimensional structures, especially in sites for cardiolipin (64.Palsdottir H. Hunte C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1666: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In addition, His often contributes a pH dependence for binding (65.He J. Vora M. Haney R.M. Filonov G.S. Musselman C.A. Burd C.G. Kutateladze A.G. Verkhusha V.V. Stahelin R.V. Kutateladze T.G. Proteins Struct. Funct. Bioinformat. 2009; 76: 852-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 66.Kawai C. Pessoto F.S. Rodrigues T. Mugnol K.C. Tórtora V. Castro L. Milícchio V.A. Tersariol I.L. Di Mascio P. Radi R. Carmona-Ribeiro A.M. Nantes I.L. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 8335-8342Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), becoming cationic at a slightly reduced pH. The more deeply penetrating monotopic proteins also caused a local convex change in bilayer curvature, which was absent for less penetrating species (63.Balali-Mood K. Bond P.J. Sansom M.S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 2135-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Likewise, positively supercharged (soluble) green fluorescent protein can penetrate through mammalian membranes but where correspondingly charged peptides failed (67.McNaughton B.R. Cronican J.J. Thompson D.B. Liu D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6111-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Hence, numbers of cationic amino acids and protein penetration profiles of full-sized proteins seem connected. The penetration of alMGS into the bilayer is supported by a recorded decrease in acyl chain order (32.Li L. Storm P. Karlsson O.P. Berg S. Wieslander A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9677-9686Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).FIGURE 8Positive charges on alMGS, alDGS, and MurG binding surfaces. The amounts of cationic charge on interface-penetrating surfaces in monotopic proteins seem to correlate with extent (depth) of intercalation according to a recent analysis (63.Balali-Mood K. Bond P.J. Sansom M.S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 2135-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Validated three-dimensional models of alMGS and alDGS (from fold recognition and modeling (35.Edman M. Berg S. Storm P. Wikström M. Vikström S. Ohman A. Wieslander A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8420-8428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)) and x-ray structure of MurG (Protein Data Bank code 1F0K) show the distribution of the positively charged residues arginine, lysine, and histidine.

The lysines are in dark blue, arginines in light blue, and histidines in green.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Membrane Expansion by Lipid SynthesisMembrane lipid biosynthesis is frequently taking place in one monolayer in a membrane, and lipids are then distributed to the other monolayer by special transporters or by spontaneous but slower “flip-flop.” A strong stimulation of lipid synthesis may either bend the bilayer due to monolayer expansion (cf. “Interface-interacting Proteins” above) or, if transmembrane equilibrium is fast, bend the entire membrane inward into the cytoplasm if the lateral expansion is prevented by a surrounding barrier, like the peptidoglycan cell wall in bacteria. For erythrocytes, recorded shape changes by introduction of certain drugs and polar lipids with various packing geometries in one of the monolayers is explained by the “bilayer-couple hypothesis” (68.Christiansson A. Kuypers F.A. Roelofsen B. Op den Kamp J.A. van Deenen L.L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1455-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 69.Sheetz M.P. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1974; 71: 4457-4461Crossref PubMed Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). Analogous features have been analyzed in liposomes and can be interpreted in terms of differences in lateral areas of the two monolayers, the enclosed volume and bilayer bending energies (70.Svetina S. Zeks B. Cell. Mol. Biol. Lett. 2001; 6: 305-311PubMed Google Scholar).In E. coli the membrane lipid PG (anionic) seems to be a pace-keeper for polar lipid synthesis, the pathway branch of which can dramatically increase in rate to keep up with demands (71.Jackson B.J. Gennity J.M. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13464-13468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of the other major lipid PE (zwitterionic) is governed by the interface surface charge given by PG and CL (72.Linde K. Gröbner G. Rilfors L. FEBS Lett. 2004; 575: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 73.Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar); hence, more PG yields synthesis of more PE. Withdrawal laterally of PG from the membrane pool by binding to plus-charged clusters in overexpressed membrane proteins may be a signal for increased membrane lipid biosynthesis, where a shortage of PG is sensed and counteracted by increased synthesis. Interestingly, PlsB (cf. above) is considered to function as a sensor for coordination of membrane protein synthesis and phospholipid formation in E. coli (74.Zhang Y.M. Rock C.O. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 1867-1874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). It has been established recently that plus-charged proteins and peptides can bind and thereby withdraw the minus-charged phospholipids PG and CL from the free pool in a bilayer (59.Epand R.F. Tokarska-Schlattner M. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Epand R.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 365: 968-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 75.Epand R.M. Rotem S. Mor A. Berno B. Epand R.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008; 130: 14346-14352Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). By binding to PG (and CL), the many alMGS molecules may withdraw these lipids laterally from the bilayer; alMGS and its binding h"

We have previously quantified SV40 large T antigen expressed over a several fold range in different cell lines and correlated the average number of molecules to average fluorescence obtained by cytometry and determined cell cycle phase related expression by calculation from multi-parametric cytometry data. Using a modified approach, we report quantification of endogenous cyclin B1 and generation of the cell cycle time related expression profile. Methodology Recombinant cyclin B1 was purified from a baculovirus lysate using an antibody affinity column and concentrated. We created fixed cell preparations from nocodazole-treated (high cyclin B1) and serum starved (low cyclin B1) PC3 cells that were either lyophilized (for preservation) or solubilized. The lysates and purified cyclin B1 were subjected to Western blotting; the cell preparations were subjected to cytometry, and fluorescence was correlated to molecules. Three untreated cell lines (K562, HeLa, and RKO) were prepared for cytometry without lyophilization and also prepared for Western blotting. These were quantified by Western blotting and by cytometry using the standard cell preparations. Results The standard cell preparations had 1.5×105 to 2.5×106 molecules of cyclin B1 per cell on average (i.e., 16-fold range). The average coefficient of variation was 24%. Fluorescence varied 12-fold. The relationship between molecules/cell (Western blot) and immunofluorescence (cytometry) was linear (r2 = 0.87). Average cyclin B1 levels for the three untreated cell lines determined by Western blotting and cytometry agreed within a factor of 2. The non-linear rise in cyclin B1 in S phase was quantified from correlated plots of cyclin B1 and DNA content. The peak levels achieved in G2 were similar despite differences in lineage, growth conditions, and rates of increase through the cell cycle (range: 1.6–2.2×106 molecules per cell). Conclusions Net cyclin B1 expression begins in G1 in human somatic cells lines; increases non-linearly with variation in rates of accumulation, but peaks at similar peak values in different cell lines growing under different conditions. This suggests tight quantitative end point control."

This led to a search in human brain cDNA libraries, and the discovery of two novel isoforms, beta(2S1) and beta(2S2), bearing variations in the neighborhood of Exon-10. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of postmortem brain samples showed increased beta(2S1) expression and decreased beta(2S2) expression in both SCZ and bipolar disorder (BPD) compared to controls. Disease-control differences were significantly correlated with SNP rs187269 in BPD males for both beta(2S1) and beta(2S2) expressions, and significantly correlated with SNPs rs2546620 and rs187269 in SCZ males for beta(2S2) expression. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis indicated that Thr(365), a potential phosphorylation site in Exon-10, played a key role in determining the time profile of the ATP-dependent electrophysiological current run-down.This study therefore provided experimental evidence for the importance of non-coding sequences in the Exon-10 region in GABRB2 with respect to beta(2)-subunit splicing diversity and the etiologies of SCZ and BPD."
https://openalex.org/W2070342675,"Regulated proteolysis by ATP-dependent proteases is universal in all living cells. In Bacillus subtilis, the degradation of the competence transcription factor ComK is mediated by a ternary complex involving the adaptor protein MecA and the ATP-dependent protease ClpCP. Here we demonstrate that a C-terminal, 98-amino acid domain of MecA (residues 121-218) serves as a non-recycling, degradation tag and targets a variety of fusion proteins to the ClpCP protease for degradation. MecA-(121-218) facilitates productive oligomerization of ClpC, stimulates the ATPase activity of ClpC, and allows the activated ClpC complex to stably associate with ClpP. Importantly, the ClpCP protease undergoes dynamic cycles of assembly and disassembly, which are triggered by association with MecA and the degradation of MecA, respectively."

IntroductionMitochondria from many higher plants possess, in addition to the conventional cytochrome c oxidase, a second terminal oxidase that oxidizes ubiquinol (1.Finnegan P.M. Soole K.L. Umbach A.L. Plant Mitochondria: From Genome To Function. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2004: 163Google Scholar, 2.Berthold D.A. Stenmark P. Annu. Rev. Plant.

In thermogenic plants this alternative oxidase (AOX) 6The abbreviations used are: AOXalternative oxidaseATRattenuated total reflectionδIPin plane bendingFTIRFourier transform infraredTAOtrypanosomal alternative oxidaserTAOrecombinant TAO expressed in a heme-deficient strain of E. coliνs and νassymmetric and asymmetric stretching, respectively. plays a key role in the release of heat for pollination purposes or for maintaining a warm environment within the flower at low ambient temperatures. In nonthermogenic plants its function is still under debate; proposed roles include maintaining tricarboxylic acid cycle turnover under high cytosolic phosphorylation potentials, defense against oxidative stress, and growth rate and energy charge homeostasis (4.Moore A.L. Albury M.S. Crichton P.G. Affourtit C. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 478-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). AOX is also found in species of fungi, green algae, bacteria, and protozoa (5.McDonald A.E. Vanlerberghe G.C. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. D. 2006; 1: 357-364Google Scholar) and, more recently, in mollusks, nematodes, and chordates (6.McDonald A. Vanlerberghe G. IUBMB Life. 2004; 56: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Of particular importance, however, is its presence in pathogenic protozoa such as the blood parasite Trypanosoma brucei (7.Chaudhuri M. Ott R.D. Hill G.C. Trends Parasitol. 2006; 22: 484-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and the intestinal parasite Cryptosporidium parvum (8.Roberts C.W. Roberts F. Henriquez F.L.

Trends Parasitol. 2006; 22: 484-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The bloodstream forms of T. brucei appear to depend solely on its alternative oxidase (TAO) for respiration. Because the protein is absent from the mammalian host, TAO is an attractive and important chemotherapeutic target for African trypanosomiasis (7.Chaudhuri M. Ott R.D. Hill G.C.

In this respect it is interesting to note that ascofuranone, isolated from the pathogenic fungus Ascochyta visiae, specifically and potently inhibits the quinol oxidase activity of TAO (11.Minagawa N.

In addition, the chemotherapeutic efficacy of ascofuranone in vivo has been confirmed (12.Yabu Y. Yoshida A. Suzuki T. Nihei C. Kawai K. Minagawa N. Hosokawa T. Nagai K. Kita K. Ohta N. Parasitol. Int. 2003; 52: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Compared with other respiratory chain complexes, the structure and mechanism of AOX are poorly characterized because of difficulties encountered in purification and a dearth of spectroscopic signatures. It has been proposed from sequence comparisons that AOX is a nonheme diiron carboxylate protein in which the metal atoms are ligated by glutamic acid and histidine residues within a four-helix bundle (1.Finnegan P.M. Soole K.L. Umbach A.L. Plant Mitochondria: From Genome To Function. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2004: 163Google Scholar, 2.Berthold D.A. Stenmark P. Annu. Rev. Plant.

The requirement for such a tertiary structural motif, as well as the necessary spacing between the iron-ligating amino acids, imposes considerable constraints upon overall possible three-dimensional structure and, consequently, its attachment to the membrane. The current model of the AOX, supported by mutagenesis studies, predicts a monotopic integral membrane protein (2.Berthold D.A. Stenmark P. Annu. Rev. Plant.

A signal around g = 15, observed with parallel mode EPR in reduced samples, was attributed to the diferrous state. A second signal, observed only after reaction of this state with oxygen, was assigned to a mixed valence (FeIIFeIII) form. More recently, Affourtit and Moore (21.Affourtit C. Moore A.L. Biochim.

Further spectroscopic tools are clearly desirable to resolve these inconsistencies, and, with this aim in mind, we report here the first electrochemical/FTIR study of a highly purified and stable preparation of recombinant AOX (rTAO) from T. brucei.

In thermogenic plants this alternative oxidase (AOX) 6The abbreviations used are: AOXalternative oxidaseATRattenuated total reflectionδIPin plane bendingFTIRFourier transform infraredTAOtrypanosomal alternative oxidaserTAOrecombinant TAO expressed in a heme-deficient strain of E. coliνs and νassymmetric and asymmetric stretching, respectively. plays a key role in the release of heat for pollination purposes or for maintaining a warm environment within the flower at low ambient temperatures. In nonthermogenic plants its function is still under debate; proposed roles include maintaining tricarboxylic acid cycle turnover under high cytosolic phosphorylation potentials, defense against oxidative stress, and growth rate and energy charge homeostasis (4.Moore A.L. Albury M.S. Crichton P.G. Affourtit C. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 478-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). AOX is also found in species of fungi, green algae, bacteria, and protozoa (5.McDonald A.E. Vanlerberghe G.C. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. D. 2006; 1: 357-364Google Scholar) and, more recently, in mollusks, nematodes, and chordates (6.McDonald A. Vanlerberghe G. IUBMB Life. 2004; 56: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Of particular importance, however, is its presence in pathogenic protozoa such as the blood parasite Trypanosoma brucei (7.Chaudhuri M. Ott R.D. Hill G.C. Trends Parasitol. 2006; 22: 484-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and the intestinal parasite Cryptosporidium parvum (8.Roberts C.W. Roberts F. Henriquez F.L.

T. brucei is a parasite that causes African sleeping sickness in humans and Nagana in livestock and is transmitted by the tsetse fly (7.Chaudhuri M. Ott R.D. Hill G.C. Trends Parasitol. 2006; 22: 484-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The bloodstream forms of T. brucei appear to depend solely on its alternative oxidase (TAO) for respiration. Because the protein is absent from the mammalian host, TAO is an attractive and important chemotherapeutic target for African trypanosomiasis (7.Chaudhuri M. Ott R.D. Hill G.C.

Fukai Y. Kita K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1587: 234-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this respect it is interesting to note that ascofuranone, isolated from the pathogenic fungus Ascochyta visiae, specifically and potently inhibits the quinol oxidase activity of TAO (11.Minagawa N. Yabu Y. Kita K. Nagai K. Ohta N. Meguro K. Sakajo S. Yoshimoto A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and rapidly kills the parasites. In addition, the chemotherapeutic efficacy of ascofuranone in vivo has been confirmed (12.Yabu Y. Yoshida A. Suzuki T. Nihei C. Kawai K. Minagawa N. Hosokawa T. Nagai K. Kita K. Ohta N. Parasitol. Int. 2003; 52: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Compared with other respiratory chain complexes, the structure and mechanism of AOX are poorly characterized because of difficulties encountered in purification and a dearth of spectroscopic signatures. It has been proposed from sequence comparisons that AOX is a nonheme diiron carboxylate protein in which the metal atoms are ligated by glutamic acid and histidine residues within a four-helix bundle (1.Finnegan P.M. Soole K.L. Umbach A.L. Plant Mitochondria: From Genome To Function. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2004: 163Google Scholar, 2.Berthold D.A. Stenmark P. Annu. Rev. Plant.

The requirement for such a tertiary structural motif, as well as the necessary spacing between the iron-ligating amino acids, imposes considerable constraints upon overall possible three-dimensional structure and, consequently, its attachment to the membrane. The current model of the AOX, supported by mutagenesis studies, predicts a monotopic integral membrane protein (2.Berthold D.A. Stenmark P. Annu. Rev. Plant. Biol. 2003; 54: 497-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 13.Andersson M.E. Nordlund P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14.Berthold D.A.

The first spectroscopic evidence for iron involvement was provided by Berthold et al. (20.Berthold D.A. Voevodskaya N. Stenmark P. Gräslund A. Nordlund P. J. Biol.

A signal around g = 15, observed with parallel mode EPR in reduced samples, was attributed to the diferrous state. A second signal, observed only after reaction of this state with oxygen, was assigned to a mixed valence (FeIIFeIII) form. More recently, Affourtit and Moore (21.Affourtit C. Moore A.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1608: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) prepared an active AOX protein from Arum maculatum. Parallel mode EPR studies (22.Moore A.L. Carré J.E. Affourtit C.

Further spectroscopic tools are clearly desirable to resolve these inconsistencies, and, with this aim in mind, we report here the first electrochemical/FTIR study of a highly purified and stable preparation of recombinant AOX (rTAO) from T. brucei."

In this paper, an Agilent customized microarray representing 4,106 genes was used to study temporal transcript profiles of Bacillus subtilis in response to valine, glutamate and glutamine pulses over 24 h. A total of 673, 835, and 1135 amino-acid-regulated genes were identified having significantly changed expression at one or more time points in response to valine, glutamate, and glutamine, respectively, including genes involved in cell wall, cellular import, metabolism of amino-acids and nucleotides, transcriptional regulation, flagellar motility, chemotaxis, phage proteins, sporulation, and many genes of unknown function. Different amino acid treatments were compared in terms of both the global temporal profiles and the 5-minute quick regulations, and between-experiment differential genes were identified. The highlighted genes were analyzed based on diverse sources of gene functions using a variety of computational tools, including T-profiler analysis, and hierarchical clustering. The results revealed the common and distinct modes of action of these three amino acids, and should help to elucidate the specific signaling mechanism of each amino acid as an effector."

Using Fourier transform infrared and optical absorption spectroscopy, we have investigated the interplay between ferrous hIDO, the ligand analog CO, and the physiological substrate L-Trp. These data provide the long sought evidence for two distinct L-Trp binding sites. Upon photodissociation from the heme iron at T > 200 K, CO escapes into the solvent. Concomitantly, L-Trp exits the active site and, depending on the l-Trp concentration, migrates to a secondary binding site or into the solvent. Although L-Trp is spectroscopically silent at this site, it is still noticeable due to its pronounced effect on the CO association kinetics, which are significantly slower than those of L-Trp-free hIDO. L-Trp returns to its initial site only after CO has rebound to the heme iron."

https://openalex.org/W2018456198,"Protoporphyrin IX ferrochelatase (EC 4.99.1.1) catalyzes the terminal step in the heme biosynthetic pathway, the insertion of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin IX. Ferrochelatase shows specificity, in vitro, for multiple metal ion substrates and exhibits substrate inhibition in the case of zinc, copper, cobalt, and nickel. Zinc is the most biologically significant of these; when iron is depleted, zinc porphyrins are formed physiologically. Examining the k(cat)/K(m)(app) ratios for zinc and iron reveals that, in vitro, zinc is the preferred substrate at all concentrations of porphyrin. This is not the observed biological specificity, where zinc porphyrins are abnormal; these data argue for the existence of a specific iron delivery mechanism in vivo. We demonstrate that zinc acts as an uncompetitive substrate inhibitor, suggesting that ferrochelatase acts via an ordered pathway. Steady-state characterization demonstrates that the apparent k(cat) depends on zinc and shows substrate inhibition. Although porphyrin substrate is not inhibitory, zinc inhibition is enhanced by increasing porphyrin concentration. This indicates that zinc inhibits by binding to an enzyme-product complex (EZnD(IX)) and is likely to be the second substrate in an ordered mechanism. Our analysis shows that substrate inhibition by zinc is not a mechanism that can promote specificity for iron over zinc, but is instead one that will reduce the production of all metalloporphyrins in the presence of high concentrations of zinc."

In vascular myocytes, it is thought that activation of ClCa causes membrane depolarization due to the fact that Cl− is actively transported into the cell (1.Chipperfield A.R. Harper A.A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 175-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), thus yielding an equilibrium potential (∼−20 mV) that is more positive than the resting potential of the cell (∼−50 mV). The ensuing depolarization caused by net Cl− efflux from the cell through ClCa in turn increases the open probability of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, favoring Ca2+ entry and increased muscle tone (2.Large W.A. Wang Q. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C435-C454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Leblanc N. Ledoux J. Saleh S. Sanguinetti A. Angermann J. O'Driscoll K. Britton F. Perrino B.A. Greenwood I.A. Can J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2005; 83: 541-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Studies of the past decade have shown that ClCa channels of airway and arterial smooth muscle cells are down-regulated by at least one phosphorylation step involving calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) (4.Greenwood I.A. Ledoux J. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. 2001; 534: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 5.Wang Y.X. Kotlikoff M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 14918-14923Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The target of CaMKII mediating this effect is presently unknown because the molecular identity of the channel underlying ClCa in smooth muscle and many other cell types is still unresolved. It is thought that CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation may serve as a braking system to counteract or minimize the impact of the positive feedback loop established by the ClCa-induced depolarization, its effect on Ca2+ entry through L-type Ca2+ channels, and finally activation of ClCa (3.Leblanc N. Ledoux J. Saleh S. Sanguinetti A. Angermann J. O'Driscoll K. Britton F. Perrino B.A. Greenwood I.A. Can J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2005; 83: 541-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 6.Angermann J.E. Sanguinetti A.R. Kenyon J.L. Leblanc N. Greenwood I.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).In rabbit pulmonary arterial myocytes from large conduit arteries, ClCa channel activity runs down quickly over 5–10 min of cell dialysis with 3 mm ATP to support phosphorylation (6.Angermann J.E. Sanguinetti A.R. Kenyon J.L. Leblanc N. Greenwood I.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, when ATP is either absent or replaced by an equivalent concentration of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, AMP-PNP, rundown is attenuated and is followed by a progressive recovery of the current (6.Angermann J.E. Sanguinetti A.R. Kenyon J.L. Leblanc N. Greenwood I.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the idea that phosphorylation by CaMKII and perhaps other kinases overwhelms the activity of phosphatases whose activity can be unmasked by lack of substrate or a substrate that cannot be hydrolyzed. This hypothesis is also supported by recent studies from our group showing that in rabbit pulmonary artery myocytes dialyzed with ATP, ClCa rundown could be similarly attenuated and subsequently reversed by cellular introduction of a constitutively active form of calcineurin (CaN) (7.Greenwood I.A. Ledoux J. Sanguinetti A. Perrino B.A. Leblanc N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38830-38837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a serine-threonine Ca2+-dependent phosphatase also referred to as PP2B. Endogenous CaN activity also antagonizes CaMKII-induced suppression of ClCa activity in rabbit pulmonary (7.Greenwood I.A. Ledoux J. Sanguinetti A. Perrino B.A. Leblanc N. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2003; 552: 701-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) artery myocytes.The major goal of the present study was to determine whether the two ubiquitously expressed serine-threonine phosphatases PP1 (protein phosphatases type 1) and PP2A (protein phosphatases type 2A) might also regulate ClCa in pulmonary arterial myocytes. Such a premise was partially based on the observation that in coronary myocytes, CaN-mediated up-regulation of the Ca2+-activated Cl− current (ICl(Ca)) was Ca2+-dependent, displaying a significant contribution of this phosphatase at intermediate [Ca2+]i (350 and 500 nm) but not at high [Ca2+]i (1 μm) (9.Ledoux J. Greenwood I. Villeneuve L.R. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. 2003; 552: 701-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). At such high levels of [Ca2+]i, inhibition of CaMKII with KN-93 after suppressing CaN with cyclosporine A (CsA) still led to enhancement of ICl(Ca) (9.Ledoux J. Greenwood I. Villeneuve L.R. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. 2003; 552: 701-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of another phosphatase. Our study shows that as for CaN (7.Greenwood I.A. Ledoux J.

Physiol. 2003; 552: 701-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), several isoforms of PP1 and PP2A are expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in rabbit pulmonary artery, and these Ca2+-independent phosphatases play a major role in regulating these channels.DISCUSSIONCa2+-activated Cl− channels in smooth muscle cells are tightly regulated by one or several phosphorylation mechanisms whose molecular target(s) remain unknown (3.Leblanc N. Ledoux J. Saleh S. Sanguinetti A. Angermann J. O'Driscoll K. Britton F. Perrino B.A. Greenwood I.A. Can J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2005; 83: 541-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 4.Greenwood I.A. Ledoux J. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. 2001; 534: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 5.Wang Y.X. Kotlikoff M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 14918-14923Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The present study further extends this concept by demonstrating for the first time that in addition to Ca2+-calmodulin-regulated calcineurin (7.Greenwood I.A. Ledoux J. Sanguinetti A. Perrino B.A. Leblanc N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38830-38837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), at least one Ca2+-independent serine/threonine phosphatase (PP1/PP2A) is also involved in regulating native ClCa channels. Our study also provides evidence supporting an interaction between CaN Aα and PP1. Our data show that transcripts for several isoforms of these enzymes as well as calcineurin are expressed in the rabbit pulmonary artery. Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence experiments confirmed the presence of several PP1 isoforms and PP2A. In cells dialyzed with no ATP, intracellular application of selective inhibitors of calcineurin or the non-selective PP1/PP2A inhibitors okadaic acid and cantharidin reduced the initial phosphorylation-mediated rundown of ICl(Ca) and inhibited its delayed recovery. Based on these results, highly selective inhibitors of PP1 and PP2A were used. The PP1 inhibitor NIPP-1 potently inhibited the recovery of ICl(Ca) in cells dialyzed with no ATP, whereas the PP2A-selective antagonist fostriecin was without effect. In contrast, an exogenous application of PP1 and PP2A yielded different results, with excess PP1 failing to enhance ICl(Ca) in the presence of 3 mm ATP to support phosphorylation and PP2A causing a delayed stimulation of the current, which could be blocked by fostriecin. Potential mechanisms explaining these results and the functional significance of ICl(Ca) regulation by Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent phosphatases are discussed below.Expression of Several Isoforms of Serine/Threonine Phosphatases in Rabbit Pulmonary ArteryWe previously reported the unique translocation of CaN Aα from the cytosol to the membrane following elevation of intracellular Ca2+ levels. This was paralleled by functional experiments showing that CaN Aα but not CaN Aβ up-regulated ICl(Ca) in myocytes supplied with 3 mm ATP (7.Greenwood I.A. Ledoux J. Sanguinetti A. Perrino B.A. Leblanc N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38830-38837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The present study provided evidence for the expression of mRNA transcripts for both these CaN isoforms, whereas CaN Aγ was undetectable.Three catalytic isoforms of PP1 (PP1c-α, -β/δ, and -γ) were identified at the mRNA and protein levels. The expressed proteins displayed a molecular mass that is well within the range expected for these isoforms (35–37 kDa) (13.Ceulemans H. Bollen M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). To our knowledge, our study is the first to report the existence of the PP1c-α in smooth muscle cells. In smooth muscle, PP1c-β/δ, commonly referred to as myosin light chain phosphatase, is the major phosphatase controlling the state of phosphorylation of regulatory light chain (LC20) of myosin and muscle relaxation (22.Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdödi F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37211-37214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising to have detected this isoform in our preparation. PP1c-γ was by far the easiest isoform to detect by reverse transcription-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence. Two splice variants of PP1c-γ, γ1 and γ2, are expressed in mammalian cells (13.Ceulemans H. Bollen M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 22.Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The measured molecular mass of 35 kDa is consistent with PP1c-γ1 because PP1c-γ2 exhibits a slightly higher molecular mass (39 kDa) (24.Shima H. Haneji T. Hatano Y. Kasugai I. Sugimura T. Nagao M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 930-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). PP1c-γ1 was recently shown to be expressed in a mouse aortic smooth muscle cell line (25.Tchivilev I.

Finally, two transcripts encoding for the α and β catalytic isoforms of PP2A were detected by reverse transcription-PCR; a PP2A antibody also identified a 36 kDa band consistent with PP2A in many cell types (14.Janssens V. Longin S. Goris J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 113-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), including tracheal smooth muscle (26.Zhou X.B. Ruth P. Schlossmann J. Hofmann F. Korth M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19760-19767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our data thus confirm that the functional significance of ClCa channel regulation by both Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-insensitive serine/threonine phosphatases reported in our study is corroborated by the molecular detection of the key enzymes of interest.Regulation of ICl(Ca) by Endogenous Serine Threonine PhosphatasesA wide range of non-selective and highly selective inhibitors of protein phosphatases were used in this study and established unequivocally that ICl(Ca) is regulated by CaN and PP1/PP2A, but for reasons explained below, we speculate that PP1 may be the enzyme regulating these channels. A previous study from our group showed that in cells dialyzed with ATP, the response of ICl(Ca) to the CaN inhibitor CsA was found to be variable, with one group of cells displaying sensitivity and the other failing to respond to this agent (7.Greenwood I.A. Ledoux J. Sanguinetti A. Perrino B.A. Leblanc N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38830-38837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We attributed this observation to a dominance of kinase activity, primarily CaMKII (4.Greenwood I.A. Ledoux J. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. 2001; 534: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), over phosphatase activity, in the control of ICl(Ca) under a sustained elevation of intracellular [Ca2+]. Indeed, ICl(Ca) entrained by cyclical elevations of [Ca2+]i due to the opening of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels was consistently inhibited by CsA, a situation that would be expected to yield a lower state of CaMKII autophosphorylation and thus a higher contribution from phosphatases (7.Greenwood I.A. Ledoux J. Sanguinetti A. Perrino B.A. Leblanc N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38830-38837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In this particular study, we showed that when the influence of kinases was blunted by lack of substrate, blocking CaN with the specific autoinhibitory peptide (CaN-AIP) led to enhancement of the initial rundown of ICl(Ca) and suppression of its delayed recovery. Our interpretation of these results is that at the time of rupturing the seal, endogenous ATP levels are utilized by kinases to phosphorylate the channel or a regulatory subunit in the channel complex, which leads to ICl(Ca) inactivation (6.Angermann J.E. Sanguinetti A.R. Kenyon J.L. Leblanc N. Greenwood I.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). As cellular ATP levels get depleted over time, phosphatases take over and promote ClCa channel recovery, a process that can be blocked by inhibiting CaN with CaN-AIP (this study) or CsA (8.Wiwchar M. Ayon R. Greenwood I.A. Leblanc N. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar).The widely used PP1/PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid dose-dependently enhanced the rundown of ICl(Ca) and inhibited its delayed recovery in PA myocytes dialyzed with no ATP to promote dephosphorylation by endogenous phosphatases. After 20 min, the IC50 of OA for blocking recovery of late current elicited at +90 mV was ∼2 nm, and a maximal effect requiring more than 30 nm was comparable with that achieved by CaN inhibitors. At any of the concentrations tested, OA has no effect on protein kinase A, protein kinase C, and CaMKII activities (16.Haystead T.A. Sim A.T. Carling D. Honnor R.C. Tsukitani Y. Cohen P. Hardie D.G. Nature. 1989; 337: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 27.Bialojan C. Takai A. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar). Possible complicating effects of kinases were minimized by removing ATP from the pipette solution, which probably severely depleted endogenous stores of the nucleotide, leaving little substrate for phosphorylation. Although it is not possible to conclude in favor of either enzyme, the measured IC50 of 2 nm OA and estimated concentration required (>30–50 nm) to yield a maximal response (IC50 for blocking PP2A, 0.01–1 nm; IC50 for blocking PP1, 3–100 nm) (15.Cohen P. Holmes C.F. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar, 16.Haystead T.A. Sim A.T. Carling D. Honnor R.C. Tsukitani Y. Cohen P.

Neurochem. 1995; 64: 340-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) would be more consistent with PP1. Another non-selective but less potent PP1/PP2A inhibitor than OA, cantharidin, also blocked the recovery of ICl(Ca). As for OA, cantharidin offers some selectivity for preferentially blocking PP2A over PP1, although the range is quite narrow with a ∼10-fold difference in IC50 values. The reported IC50 ranges for blocking PP2A and PP1 are 40–200 and 473–2000 nm, respectively (17.Honkanen R.E. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 19.Sheppeck 2nd, J.E. Gauss C.M. Chamberlin A.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1739-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In contrast to OA, at the concentration used in our study (100 nm), cantharidin would be expected to preferentially block PP2A. However, we have to be careful before making conclusions about the identity of the phosphatase involved based on the above results because the extracted values were obtained from enzyme assays carried out under very specific conditions (different substrates, cell lysates, or homogenate extracts, etc.). As an example, Obara and Yabu (29.Obara K. Yabu H. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C296-C301Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that L-type Ca2+ current (ICaL) in guinea pig intestinal smooth muscle cells is dually regulated by protein phosphatases. At low concentrations, OA dose-dependently inhibited ICaL, with maximal inhibition occurring at 10 nm. At concentrations of >100 nm, OA increased ICaL, with a maximal effect seen at ∼1 μm. These inhibitory and stimulatory responses were ascribed to reflect dephosphorylation of two distinct targets by PP2A and PP1, respectively. In another study, OA was shown to stimulate unitary Ca2+ channel activity in human vascular smooth muscle cells, and 1 μm OA was necessary to achieve maximal effect (30.Groschner K. Schuhmann K. Mieskes G. Baumgartner W. Romanin C. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The involvement of PP2A but not PP1 was directly assessed by testing the effects of OA on single Ca2+ channels exposed to PP2Ac or PP1c from the internal side of inside-out patches. The functional effects of OA in intact cells were thus observed at concentrations that are significantly higher than those required for blocking either enzyme in biochemical assays.Experiments were subsequently undertaken to consolidate the view that PP1 drives Cl− channel recovery. Fostriecin is an antitumor antibiotic agent isolated from the fermentation beer of Saccharomyces pulveraceus (20.Walsh A.H. Cheng A. Honkanen R.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This compound is ∼40,000-fold more effective at inhibiting PP2A (IC50 = 3.2 nm) over PP1 (IC50 = 131 μm), and has no influence on CaN. Inclusion of fostriecin at a concentration either ∼9- or 47-fold above its IC50 for blocking PP2A failed to alter the time course of ICl(Ca) rundown and delayed recovery. We were careful in preparing a fresh stock daily, and significant inhibitory activity was never encountered when testing a new sample prepared from a sealed vial. Moreover, 150 nm fostriecin effectively inhibited the stimulatory response on ICl(Ca) mediated by exogenous PP2A (see below), strongly suggesting that its lack of effect in cells dialyzed with no ATP was not due to its inefficacy.In contrast to fostriecin, dialysis with only a 100 pm concentration of the highly specific and endogenous inhibitor of PP1, NIPP-1 (IC50 < 1 pm) (19.Sheppeck 2nd, J.E. Gauss C.M. Chamberlin A.R. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1997; 5: 1739-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), obliterated the recovery of ICl(Ca). This polypeptide is a natural targeting regulator of PP1 that associates with RNA and plays an important role in processing pre-mRNA and splicing (22.Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The association of NIPP-1 with PP1 is highly regulated by at least one phosphorylation step (31.Beullens M. Vulsteke V. Van Eynde A. Jagiello I. Stalmans W. Bollen M. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32.Comerford K.M. Leonard M.O. Cummins E.P. Fitzgerald K.T. Beullens M. Bollen M. Taylor C.T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2006; 209: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The above results with phosphatase-selective inhibitors would suggest that endogenous PP1 rather than PP2A regulates ClCa channels in our conditions. The molecular identity of ClCa channels in vascular smooth muscle cells is still unknown. Two families of Cl− channel genes, the bestrophins (BEST1 to -4 in humans) and TMEM16A/B (anoctamin; 2 of 10 paralogs), have recently emerged as candidate gene families for ClCa channels (3.Leblanc N.

Caci E. Ferrera L. Pedemonte N. Barsanti C. Sondo E. Pfeffer U. Ravazzolo R. Zegarra-Moran O. Galietta L.J. Science. 2008; 322: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 35.Schroeder B.C.

Both classes of ClCa channel genes exhibit several consensus sequences for phosphorylation by serine/threonine protein kinases, including CaMKII. Future site-directed mutagenesis experiments are planned to determine the potential role of these sites in regulating ClCa channels. Interestingly, BEST1 (bestrophin isoform 1 or vitelliform macular dystrophy type 2 gene), one of four human genes, is expressed in the rabbit pulmonary artery (3.Leblanc N. Ledoux J. Saleh S. Sanguinetti A. Angermann J. O'Driscoll K. Britton F. Perrino B.A. Greenwood I.A. Can J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2005; 83: 541-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and was demonstrated to be dephosphorylated by PP2A via a direct physical interaction (37.Marmorstein L.Y. McLaughlin P.J. Stanton J.B. Yan L. Crabb J.W. Marmorstein A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30591-30597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). If BEST1 turns out to be a contributor to the pore-forming subunit of the ClCa channel, it will be important to determine if PP2A is physically associated and functionally interacts with BEST1 in a manner consistent with our data on regulation of the native ClCa channel.Response of ICl(Ca) to Exogenous Catalytic Subunits of PP1 and PP2ACell dialysis with purified catalytic subunits of PP1 and PP2A resulted in opposite and unsuspected effects on ICl(Ca). In these experiments, the cells were dialyzed with 3 mm ATP to support phosphorylation, and excess amounts of PP1c or PP2Ac were added to the pipette solution. This strategy was used previously to successfully demonstrate that CaN Aα but not CaN Aβ can up-regulate ICl(Ca) in rabbit PA myocytes (7.Greenwood I.A. Ledoux J. Sanguinetti A. Perrino B.A. Leblanc N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38830-38837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). At a concentration (5 units/ml) proven to modulate cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator Cl− channels in 3T3 fibroblasts and CHO cells (38.Berger H.A. Travis S.M. Welsh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2037-2047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Luo J.X. Pato M.D. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1998; 43: C1397-C1410Crossref Google Scholar) PP1c was without effect. Increasing the concentration of the phosphatase up to 8-fold failed to revert the rundown of ICl(Ca). On the contrary, inclusion of PP2Ac in the pipette solution led to progressive recovery of ICl(Ca). Without results from many more experiments, we can only speculate on possible mechanisms. Both types of enzyme are holoenzymes composed of scaffolding, interacting, and catalytic subunits, and recent studies have provided convincing evidence that the exact composition of the many possible holoenzymes is responsible for their subcellular distribution and regulation in specific organelles and that it confers substrate preferences (13.Ceulemans H. Bollen M. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 14.Janssens V. Longin S. Goris J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2008; 33: 113-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 22.Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that exogenously added PP1c cannot reach its final target due to steric hindrance or is unable to assemble with the holoenzyme counterparts that are necessary to induce the dephosphorylation step regulating ClCa channels. Another possibility is that the endogenous phosphatase may be so tightly associated with the channel via chaperone and anchoring proteins that it cannot be displaced by excess exogenous protein. In contrast, PP2A may be able to reach the target site and in excess amounts able to compete and overwhelm CaMKII. Perhaps a more attractive hypothesis to explain the effects of PP2Ac is that exogenously added enzyme inactivates constitutively active CaMKII, an excellent substrate for PP2A (28.Barnes G.N. Slevin J.T. Vanaman T.C. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 340-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 40.Strack S. Barban M.A. Wadzinski B.E. Colbran R.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 2119-2128Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), which would in turn shift the phosphorylation potential balance toward the endogenous phosphatases. This possibility is supported by the observation that the fostriecin-sensitive response of ICl(Ca) to PP2A was also potently inhibited by NIPP-1. The physiological significance of supplying excess amounts of enzyme must be interpreted with caution because almost any phosphorylated protein may be ultimately dephosphorylated by a physiologically irrelevant phosphatase if a sufficient amount is supplied.Physiological Significance of ClCa Channel by CaN and PP1/PP2AOne very intriguing observation from our data is that either CaN or PP1/PP2A is capable of regulating ClCa channels fully, indicating that the effects of both classes of phosphatases are not superimposed. In other words, when blocking either type of enzyme, the other class is unable to compensate. This suggests that CaN and PP1/PP2A are somehow linked directly or indirectly in regulating the ClCa channel. One possibility is that there are two distinct phosphorylation sites regulating the channel, each targeted by one class of phosphatases, and both phosphate groups have to be removed for the channel to recover from phosphorylation-induced block. An alternative and more attractive hypothesis is the possibility that the two phosphatases act in concert, with one regulated by the other in a downstream pathway involving phosphorylation. Such a cascade involving CaN and PP1 has been reported to play a role in long term depression and memory in the hippocampus (41.Mulkey R.M. Endo S. Shenolikar S. Malenka R.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 486-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). In this tissue, Ca2+ entry through N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors binds to calmodulin and stimulates CaN, which then dephosphorylates a high affinity PP1 inhibitor called I-1 (inhibitor of protein phosphatase type 1). When phosphorylated, I-1 is tightly bound to PP1 and inhibits it. CaN-mediated dephosphorylation of I-1 thus activates PP1. I-1 (as well as an isoform of I-1 called DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein with molecular mass of 32 kDa)) is phosphorylated by protein kinase A when the neurotransmitter dopamine activates D1-type receptors in the brain (22.Cohen P.T. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 241-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Perrino B.A. Soderling S.R. Van Eldik L. Watterson D.M. Biochemistry and Pharmacology of Calmodulin-regulated Phosphatase Calcineurin. Academic Press, Inc., Toronto1998: 169-236Google Scholar). This mechanism operates in many cell types where Ca2+ and cAMP have antagonistic effects, which is the case in vascular smooth muscle cells (43.McDaniel N.L. Rembold C.M. Murphy R.A. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1994; 72: 1380-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). When [Ca2+]i rises, relief of the inhibitory effect of I-1 on PP1 by CaN also causes dephosphorylation of CaMKII, at least in vitro, which would also promote dephosphorylation of the ClCa channel. The possibility that this pathway also exists in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells is supported by the observation that the enhancement of ICl(Ca) by CaN Aα (this study) (7.Greenwood I.A. Ledoux J. Sanguinetti A. Perrino B.A. Leblanc N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38830-38837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was potently inhibited by NIPP-1. There is little evidence for regulation of CaN by phosphorylation (42.Perrino B.A. Soderling S.R. Van Eldik L. Watterson D.M. Biochemistry and Pharmacology of Calmodulin-regulated Phosphatase Calcineurin. Academic Press, Inc., Toronto1998: 169-236Google Scholar, 44.Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13367-13370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 45.Rusnak F. Mertz P. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar), which supports the idea that CaN would be acting upstream of PP1. Fig. 10 shows a schematic diagram illustrating our working model and the hypothetical steps believed to regulate ClCa channels. In this model, PP1 is the ultimate phosphatase dephosphorylating the channel or a regulatory subunit. When intracellular Ca2+ levels rise, this activates ClCa channels directly, and both CaMKII and CaN Aα via binding of Ca2+-calmodulin. In the presence of ATP, for reasons that are still unclear, the impact of CaMKII phosphorylation is greater than that produced by phosphatases (7.Greenwood I.A. Ledoux J. Sanguinetti A. Perrino B.A. Leblanc N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38830-38837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the absence of ATP, this balance is shifted toward phosphatases, yielding up-regulation of ICl(Ca) following a transient state of phosphorylation due to consumption of endogenous ATP. Under these conditions, dephosphorylation of I-1 by CaN Aα would relieve its inhibitory effect on PP1, which would then dephosphorylate the pore-forming subunit or accessory subunit. The goal of future experiments will be to assess the potential role of I-1 in this signaling pathway and identify the kinase (protein kinase A, CaMKII, or others?) phosphorylating this regulator.ConclusionThe results presented herein demonstrate that the regulation of excitatory ClCa channels by kinases and phosphatases in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell is significantly more complicated than previously anticipated. ClCa channels are regulated by at least one kinase, CaMKII, which serves as a braking mechanism to offset the depolarizing influence of ClCa channels during signaling (3.Leblanc N. Ledoux J. Saleh S. Sanguinetti A. Angermann J. O'Driscoll K. Britton F. Perrino B.A. Greenwood I.A. Can J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2005; 83: 541-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 4.Greenwood I.A. Ledoux J.

Physiol. 2006; 128: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This CaMKII-induced phosphorylation is antagonized by a Ca2+-dependent mechanism, involving CaN Aα, and for the first time a Ca2+-independent step mediated probably by PP1 but also maybe PP2A. Our data convincingly show that both classes of enzymes are absolutely necessary to oppose kinase activity and stimulate ClCa channels. Future experiments will be conducted to define the molecular steps involved in the interplay between CaMKII, CaN, and PP1/PP2A in the regulation of Ca2+-activated Cl− conductance of the pulmonary arterial vasculature.

In vascular myocytes, it is thought that activation of ClCa causes membrane depolarization due to the fact that Cl− is actively transported into the cell (1.Chipperfield A.R. Harper A.A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 175-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), thus yielding an equilibrium potential (∼−20 mV) that is more positive than the resting potential of the cell (∼−50 mV). The ensuing depolarization caused by net Cl− efflux from the cell through ClCa in turn increases the open probability of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, favoring Ca2+ entry and increased muscle tone (2.Large W.A. Wang Q. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C435-C454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Leblanc N. Ledoux J. Saleh S. Sanguinetti A. Angermann J. O'Driscoll K. Britton F. Perrino B.A. Greenwood I.A. Can J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2005; 83: 541-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Studies of the past decade have shown that ClCa channels of airway and arterial smooth muscle cells are down-regulated by at least one phosphorylation step involving calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) (4.Greenwood I.A. Ledoux J. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. 2001; 534: 395-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 5.Wang Y.X. Kotlikoff M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 14918-14923Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The target of CaMKII mediating this effect is presently unknown because the molecular identity of the channel underlying ClCa in smooth muscle and many other cell types is still unresolved. It is thought that CaMKII-mediated phosphorylation may serve as a braking system to counteract or minimize the impact of the positive feedback loop established by the ClCa-induced depolarization, its effect on Ca2+ entry through L-type Ca2+ channels, and finally activation of ClCa (3.Leblanc N. Ledoux J. Saleh S. Sanguinetti A. Angermann J. O'Driscoll K. Britton F. Perrino B.A. Greenwood I.A. Can J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 2005; 83: 541-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 6.Angermann J.E. Sanguinetti A.R. Kenyon J.L. Leblanc N. Greenwood I.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).In rabbit pulmonary arterial myocytes from large conduit arteries, ClCa channel activity runs down quickly over 5–10 min of cell dialysis with 3 mm ATP to support phosphorylation (6.Angermann J.E. Sanguinetti A.R. Kenyon J.L. Leblanc N. Greenwood I.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, when ATP is either absent or replaced by an equivalent concentration of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue, AMP-PNP, rundown is attenuated and is followed by a progressive recovery of the current (6.Angermann J.E. Sanguinetti A.R. Kenyon J.L. Leblanc N. Greenwood I.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2006; 128: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the idea that phosphorylation by CaMKII and perhaps other kinases overwhelms the activity of phosphatases whose activity can be unmasked by lack of substrate or a substrate that cannot be hydrolyzed. This hypothesis is also supported by recent studies from our group showing that in rabbit pulmonary artery myocytes dialyzed with ATP, ClCa rundown could be similarly attenuated and subsequently reversed by cellular introduction of a constitutively active form of calcineurin (CaN) (7.Greenwood I.A. Ledoux J. Sanguinetti A. Perrino B.A. Leblanc N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38830-38837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a serine-threonine Ca2+-dependent phosphatase also referred to as PP2B. Endogenous CaN activity also antagonizes CaMKII-induced suppression of ClCa activity in rabbit pulmonary (7.Greenwood I.A. Ledoux J. Sanguinetti A. Perrino B.A. Leblanc N. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2003; 552: 701-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) artery myocytes.The major goal of the present study was to determine whether the two ubiquitously expressed serine-threonine phosphatases PP1 (protein phosphatases type 1) and PP2A (protein phosphatases type 2A) might also regulate ClCa in pulmonary arterial myocytes. Such a premise was partially based on the observation that in coronary myocytes, CaN-mediated up-regulation of the Ca2+-activated Cl− current (ICl(Ca)) was Ca2+-dependent, displaying a significant contribution of this phosphatase at intermediate [Ca2+]i (350 and 500 nm) but not at high [Ca2+]i (1 μm) (9.Ledoux J. Greenwood I. Villeneuve L.R. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. 2003; 552: 701-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). At such high levels of [Ca2+]i, inhibition of CaMKII with KN-93 after suppressing CaN with cyclosporine A (CsA) still led to enhancement of ICl(Ca) (9.Ledoux J. Greenwood I. Villeneuve L.R. Leblanc N. J. Physiol. 2003; 552: 701-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of another phosphatase. Our study shows that as for CaN (7.Greenwood I.A. Ledoux J.

Physiol. 2003; 552: 701-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), several isoforms of PP1 and PP2A are expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in rabbit pulmonary artery, and these Ca2+-independent phosphatases play a major role in regulating these channels."

These androgen-independent cells acquire the remarkable ability to adapt to the surrounding microenvironment whose factors, such as neurotransmitters, influence their survival. Although findings are becoming evident about the expression of alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors in prostate cancer epithelial cells, their exact functional role in androgen-independent cells has yet to be established. Previous work has demonstrated that membrane lipid rafts associated with key signalling proteins mediate growth and survival signalling pathways in prostate cancer cells.In order to analyze the membrane topology of the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor we explored its presence by a biochemical approach in purified detergent resistant membrane fractions of the androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line DU145. Electron microscopy observations demonstrated the colocalization of the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor with caveolin-1, the major protein component of caveolae. In addition, we showed that agonist stimulation of the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor induced resistance to thapsigargin-induced apoptosis and that caveolin-1 was necessary for this process. Further, immunohistofluorescence revealed the relation between high levels of alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor and caveolin-1 expression with advanced stage prostate cancer. We also show by immunoblotting that the TG-induced apoptosis resistance described in DU145 cells is mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK).In conclusion, we propose that alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor stimulation in androgen-independent prostate cancer cells via caveolae constitutes one of the mechanisms contributing to their protection from TG-induced apoptosis."
