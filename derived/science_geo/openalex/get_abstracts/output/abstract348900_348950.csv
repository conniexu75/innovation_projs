https://openalex.org/W1975649405,"Acid Degradation of Sperm Deoxyribonucleic Acid WE have been seeking methods for preparing de-oxyribonucleotides and nucleosides by chemical degradation of sperm deoxyribonucleic acid under acid conditions, and thought it of interest to test for liberated aldehydo groups on the various products. The results have proved of some interest in regard to the views of various workers on the interpretation of results of the Feulgen reaction1 and more particularly in the light of views described by one of us with another colleague in the following communication."

https://openalex.org/W2059631409,"Yakushiji and Okuniki1 claimed to have demonstrated the existence of a new component (cytochrome c1 of the succinic oxidase system, acting between cytochromes b and c, that is, with the same function as the respiratory catalyst which I have proposed. Since there is evidence that this catalyst2,3 is a haematin compound, Keilin and Hartree4 have recently suggested that it might be related to cytochrome c1. The claim of the Japanese workers has now been re-investigated."

https://openalex.org/W1548098961,"IT is the object of this communication to give a preliminary account of certain investigations of the Rosenblum-type spark counter for α-particles. In the course of this work it has been shown that the original wire-plate arrangement1 is a particular case of a more general type of counter in which the anode is a fine wire and the cathode may be convex, planar or concave with respect to the anode, all these counters operating in air at atmospheric pressure, with electrode separations of the order of 1 mm."
https://openalex.org/W1976117977,"IT was shown that laccase, which had been inactivated by cyanide under certain conditions, could be almost completely re-activated by cupric ions, whereas other metals were ineffective1. Further evidence will be presented here to show that copper is an essential constituent of this enzyme. Laccase was purified by the method of D. Bertrand2,3. At each successive stage of purification the enzyme activity was measured in the manner previously described1, and copper and manganese were estimated by microchemical methods4,5. Manganese disappears after the first steps of purification; the copper content increases with the and remains proportional to activity in all fractions up to the purest preparation having 30,000 in presence of paraphenylene diamine (Fig. 1)."

https://openalex.org/W2072082911,"THE mean stopping power of liquid water averaged over the whole range has been determined for natural α-particles by Michl1 and by Philipp2. These authors find values for the molecular stopping power which are higher by about 20 and 14 per cent respectively than those predicted by the Bragg law and the accepted atomic stopping powers of hydrogen and oxygen. Philipp (loc. cit.) has also shown that the stopping power of water vapour accords with the Bragg law. The tendency among physicists has, however, been to treat the Bragg law as a more reliable guide to the stopping power of liquid water than the experiments."
https://openalex.org/W1967522317,"OCCASIONS frequently arise in microscopy where a working distance much greater than that given by conventional objectives for a given numerical aperture is required. This occurs in the microscopy of hot metallurgical specimens inside a vacuum furnace, the examination of electrode conditions inside a vacuum tube, various biological applications, and the examination of nuclear plates which may involve working through considerable thicknesses of glass and emulsion."

This enzyme hydrolyses the amorphous mucoids of the connective tissue and increases its permeability1. But it has not yet been possible to establish why the activity of hyaluronidase increases."

https://openalex.org/W2024420147,"THE position of hydroxylamine as an intermediate in the nitrogen fixation process has become increasingly doubtful as a result of recent studies1,2. No direct attempts have been made, however, to find the effect of hydroxylamine on nitrogen fixation. An application of the isotope tracer method to this problem is being made in these laboratories, using nitrogen containing 30 per cent nitrogen-15. A large 18-hour-old culture of Azotobacter vinelandii in a nitrogen-free mannitol medium was aseptically subdivided into equal 100-ml. portions, and 1 ml. of suitable dilutions of buffered hydroxylamine added to give the concentrations required for inhibition measurements. The cultures were then aerated in parallel with an atmosphere containing nitrogen (partial pressure, 0·25 atm.), and oxygen (partial pressure, 0·2 atm.)—the nitrogen being 'heavy'—in a thermostat at 29° C. After a four-hour period of aeration, the cells were collected, and nitrogen samples prepared for isotope analysis. The following analyses were obtained :"

The investigations have not been completed owing to the difficulty in obtaining healthy living material, which is essential for a study of this kind; but certain important features have been established and are worth recording in view of the apparently contradictory accounts in the literature."

https://openalex.org/W2066745306,"IN the course of an investigation on the formation of amylase by Bacillus subtilis, it was observed that the organism, when grown on wheat bran medium, showed a pronounced antibiotic activity. The maximum activity was found in the aqueous extract from a 24-hour-old culture. The amylase formation during this period was found to be low, but steadily increased with further incubation. This phenomenon led to a study of the relationship between the antibiotic production and amylase formation by B. subtilis1 (N.C.T.C. : 2027 N) when grown on wheat bran."
https://openalex.org/W2403718950,"THE catalysis of oxalacetate decarboxylation by metallic ions constitutes a simple 'model' system, the properties of which may throw some light on the biological decarboxylation mechanisms. Kornberg, Ochoa and Mehler1 have described the formation of an unstable complex between oxalacetate and aluminium ions, which possesses a characteristic ultra-violet absorption spectrum. Recent studies from this laboratory2 have shown that iron and copper differ in many respects as regards their ability to accelerate the decomposition of oxalacetate."
https://openalex.org/W4213340974,"THE drastic roguing which is performed on crops of potatoes for seed has resulted in a reduction of the amount of therefore obvious viruses leaf-roll and rugose-mosauc. otfto virus X, however, causes a slight mottle of the foliage which is noticeable only under cartain conditions of weather, and may often be missed by the roguers. F. C. Bawden, B. Kassanis and R. M. Roberts conclude, in a recent paper (Ann. App. Biol, 25, No. 2, 250-265 ; June 1948), that the control of virus X must involve methods additional to those of field inspection. Presence of the virus in a stock of potatoes can be tested by inoculation to indicator plants and by serological methods. Spread of the virus is slow under natural conditions, and the authors conclude that the maintenance of stocks from which virus X has been eliminated by testing is feasible under commercial conditions. The virus reduces yield by 5-24 per cent; but it is refreshing to find the idea of clonal selection also considered along with questions of yield and loss due to virus."

https://openalex.org/W1997620139,"Hurd and Mold1 have recently described the dehydration of 2-fluorenylcyclohexanol to a saturated hydrocarbon to which they attribute the structure (I) of 1 : 9-cyclohexylenenuorene. If this structure were correct, the result would be of considerable importance, for it would represent the first successful attempt to prepare a compound having the highly strained ring-system (II) which von Braun had completely failed to obtain2."
https://openalex.org/W2016109489,"A REACTION is known to take place when organic compounds containing hydrogen are heated above the melting point with elementary sulphur. Among other decomposition products hydrogen sulphide is evolved, and its evolution is especially marked when a polyhydric phenol, for example, hydroquinone or pyrogallol, is the reducing agent. The generation of hydrogen sulphide for laboratory use from a melted mixture of sulphur and paraffin wax is perhaps a more familiar example of the reaction. So far as can be ascertained from the literature, the analytical possibilities of the reaction have not been explored previously, yet it affords a means of detecting sulphur quickly and conveniently in complex or coloured materials, provided they are not too readily combustible."

https://openalex.org/W2071087619,"IT seems in certain cases reasonable to suggest an influence of ultrasonic treatment on radioactive emanating power1. Ultrasound may bring about changes in a solid substance which involve changes of the emanating power, either by affecting the specific surface or the diffusion coefficient of the emanation in the solid phase. A change of the former property should be permanent or show remanence, whereas a change of the latter should be restored after ceasing ultrasonic treatment. It should thus be possible to conclude which of the two changes has occurred."
https://openalex.org/W2073388784,"THE success of D.D.T. and benzene hexachloride insecticides has already shown the important part that synthetic chemicals can play in agriculture, Interest is therefore being shown in the organophosphorus group of insectcides, especially as certain of these compounds show high contact-activity and others are capable of rendering the plant systemically insectreidal. As these compounds have not yet been available in sufficient amounts for wide-scale investigations, and as little has been published on the subject, there is a considerable demand for accurate information. A meeting of the Association of Applied Biologists on November 5 sought to adjust this state of affairs by bringing together workers qualified to speak on various aspects of the subject."
https://openalex.org/W4238797123,"ONE factor which is hindered constructive discussion in wplat Britain of the United Nations Educational scientific and Cultural Organisation is the comparative inaccessibility of many of the official documents. Although reports of the Beirut Conference last year do not yet appear to be available, the publication of Dr. Julian Huxley's second report as director-general (see p. 457), covering the activities of the Organisation during 1948, has made possible a fresh appreciation of the value and prospects of the Organisation. Together with a debate in the House of Lords on January 26, it serves to correct some ill-informed criticisms, and indicates both some of the achievements to the credit of Unesco and some weaknesses that require attention."
https://openalex.org/W4243189970,"A DISCUSSION of the evolution of colour vision took place at the general meeting of the Linnsæn Society on February 24. Dr. R. J. Pumphrey, while disclaiming expert knowledge, said that it seemed fitting that a zoologist should have been invited to open the discussion rather than a specialist in human colour vision, however knowledgeable, since a zoological training enforces a historical outlook, which is essential for the ultimate understanding of the evolution of function. The evidence available from animals other than mammals, though extremely relevant, is still scanty ; inferences from structure and physiology cannot be relied on. Colour vision can only be ascribed to an animal when the intact animal, either in the field or in a controlled experimental situation, has been shown to exercise a choice depending on colour discrimination. Such a test is always a matter of extreme technical difficulty, and is not applicable to any animal without restriction but only to those whose habits and motivation make them suitable subjects. In spite of these limitations, colour vision has been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt in a number of insects, notably aculeate Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera, and a number of vertebrates, notably teleost fish, reptiles, birds and primates."
