https://openalex.org/W2164034599,"Using in vitro gene amplification by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and mutation detection by the RNAase A mismatch cleavage method, we have examined c-K-ras genes in human pancreatic carcinomas. We used frozen tumor specimens and single 5 micron sections from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue surgically removed or obtained at autopsy. Twenty-one out of 22 carcinomas of the exocrine pancreas contained c-K-ras genes with mutations at codon 12. In seven cases tested, the mutation was present in both primary tumors and their corresponding metastases. No mutations were detected in normal tissue from the same cancer patients or in five gall bladder carcinomas. We conclude from these results that c-K-ras somatic mutational activation is a critical event in the oncogenesis of most, if not all, human cancers of the exocrine pancreas."
https://openalex.org/W1969583827,"Ion channel proteins are important for the conduction of ions across biological membranes. Recent analyses of their sequences have suggested that they are composed of bundles of alpha-helices that associate to form ion-conducting channels. To gain insight into the mechanisms by which alpha-helices can aggregate and conduct ions, three model peptides containing only leucine and serine residues were synthesized and characterized. A 21-residue peptide, H2N-(Leu-Ser-Ser-Leu-Leu-Ser-Leu)3-CONH2, which was designed to be a membrane-spanning amphiphilic alpha-helix, formed well-defined ion channels with ion permeability and lifetime characteristics resembling the acetylcholine receptor. In contrast, a 14-residue version of this peptide, which was too short to span the phospolipid bilayer as an alpha-helix, failed to form discrete, stable channels. A third peptide, H2N-(Leu-Ser-Leu-Leu-Leu-Ser-Leu)3-CONH2, in which one serine per heptad repeat was replaced by leucine, produced proton-selective channels. Computer graphics and energy minimization were used to create molecular models that were consistent with the observed properties of the channels."
https://openalex.org/W2087401860,"We have used formaldehyde-mediated protein-DNA crosslinking within intact cells to examine the in vivo chromatin structure of the D. melanogaster heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) genes. In agreement with previous in vitro studies, we find that the heat shock-mediated transcriptional induction of the hsp70 genes perturbs their chromatin structure, resulting in fewer protein-DNA contacts crosslinkable in vivo by formaldehyde. However, contrary to earlier in vitro evidence that histones may be absent from actively transcribed genes, we show directly, by immunoprecipitation of in vivo-crosslinked chromatin fragments, that at least histone H4 remains bound to hsp70 DNA in vivo, irrespective of its rate of transcription. The formaldehyde-based in vivo mapping techniques described in this work are generally applicable, and can be used both to probe protein-DNA interactions within specific genes and to determine the genomic location of specific chromosomal proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2012626852,"The mouse genome contains at least three copies of sequences homologous to the “paired box”, a conserved domain in several Drosophila segmentation genes of the pair-rule and segment polarity classes. Overlapping phages were isolated from two different genomic libraries using the Drosophila gooseberry distal paired box as a probe. The hybridizing sequences are highly homologous to the conserved Drosophila paired box sequences. A single 3.1 kb Pax 1 (paired box gene) transcript was detected during embryonic development, whereas no transcripts were detected in adult tissues. Detailed in situ hybridization analyses with frozen embryonic sections demonstrated Pax 1 transcripts in the perichordal zone of the developing vertebral column. The expression pattern suggests a role for this gene in the formation of segmented structures of the mouse embryo."
https://openalex.org/W2068802770,"Saturation mutagenesis and a complement fixation selection have yielded CD4 point mutants with impaired antibody and human immunodeficiency virus binding. The patterns of amino acid substitution, in conjunction with previous antibody cross-blocking data, affirm the similar tertiary structures of the CD4 amino-terminal domain and immunoglobulin variable regions. Single residue substitutions affecting virus binding and syncytium formation are observed over an eight residue segment located in a portion of the molecule homologous to the second hypervariable region of an antibody combining site."
https://openalex.org/W1544964229,"Both avian and mammalian heart cells have high affinity receptors for antidiabetic sulfonylureas. The biochemical identification of these receptors has been carried out with [3H]glibenclamide. The Kd values for the most potent sulfonylureas, such as glibenclamide itself, are in the nanomolar range. Comparative studies of structure-function relationships indicate high similarities of binding properties between the sulfonylurea receptors in cardiac cells and insulinoma cells, respectively. The duration of the action potential of guinea pig cardiac cells was drastically reduced by decreasing intracellular ATP concentrations by perfusion or by blockade of oxidative phosphorylation. Glibenclamide was found to restore normal or nearly normal action potential properties in [ATP]in-depleted cardiac cells. Single channel recording using the patch-clamp technique has shown that this effect is associated with high affinity blockade of ATP-sensitive K+ channels by sulfonylureas."
https://openalex.org/W1982332387,"Behavioral sensitization leads to both short- and long-term enhancement of synaptic transmission between the sensory and motor neurons of the gill-withdrawal reflex in Aplysia. Serotonin (5-HT), a transmitter important for short-term sensitization, can evoke long-term enhancement of synaptic strength detected 1 day later. Because 5-HT mediates short-term facilitation through adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein phosphorylation, the role of cAMP in the long-term modulation of this identified synapse was examined. Like 5-HT, cAMP can also evoke long-term facilitation lasting 24 hours. Unlike the short-term change, the long-lasting change is blocked by anisomycin, a reversible inhibitor of protein synthesis, and therefore must involve the synthesis of gene products not required for the short-term change."
https://openalex.org/W2069253625,"Forskolin is commonly used to stimulate adenylate cyclase in the study of modulation of ion channels and other proteins by adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent second messenger systems. In addition to its action on adenylate cyclase, forskolin directly alters the gating of a single class of voltage-dependent potassium channels from a clonal pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell line. This alteration occurred in isolated cell-free patches independent of soluble cytoplasmic enzymes. The effect of forskolin was distinct from those of other agents that raise intracellular cAMP levels. The 1,9-dideoxy derivative of forskolin, which is unable to activate the cyclase, was also effective in altering the potassium channel activity. This direct action of forskolin can lead to misinterpretation of results in experiments in which forskolin is assumed to selectively activate adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1983910746,"The difference in reactivity between phosphate and phosphorothioate diesters is the basis of a chemical degradation scheme for the sequencing of DNA and RNA. The phosphorothioate groups are incorporated into the nucleic acid in four separate enzymatic reactions, with three of the natural nucleoside triphosphates and one alpha-thiotriphosphate in each reaction. Selective strand cleavage is achieved through alkylation to form the hydrolytically labile phosphorothioate triester. As an example, the sequence analysis is presented of M13 phage DNA and of RNA prepared by transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase."

https://openalex.org/W2088641817,"Hemopoietic lineage commitment can be breached by concomitant expression of the c-myc and v-raf oncogenes. Switching to the myeloid lineage occurred frequently when B lineage cells, from either lymphomas or preleukemia bone marrow cells of Emu-myc transgenic mice, were infected with a retrovirus bearing v-raf. Cloned pre-B and B cell lines changed into either mature or immature macrophages as assessed by morphology, adherence, phagocytic activity, surface markers, and lysozyme production, but retained clonotypic immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. Although expression of the Emu-myc transgene was reduced or abolished in the more differentiated lines, the lines remained tumorigenic. The converted lines produced the myeloid growth factor GM-CSF, and most had karyotypic alterations. These results suggest that constitutive myc plus raf expression can provoke genetic reprogramming in lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2043287597,"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) uses the CD4 protein as a receptor for infection of susceptible cells. A candidate structure for the HIV-1 binding site on the CD4 protein was identified by epitope mapping with a family of eight functionally distinct CD4-specific monoclonal antibodies in conjunction with a panel of large CD4-derived synthetic peptides. All of the seven epitopes that were located reside within two immunoglobulin-like disulfide loops situated between residues 1 and 168 of the CD4 protein. The CD4-specific monoclonal antibody OKT4A, a potent inhibitor of HIV-1 binding, recognized a site between residues 32 and 47 on the CD4 protein. By analogy to other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins, this particular region has been predicted to exist as a protruding loop. A synthetic analog of this loop (residues 25 to 58) showed a concentration-dependent inhibition of HIV-1-induced cell fusion. It is proposed that a loop extending from residues 37 to 53 of the CD4 protein is a binding site for the AIDS virus."
https://openalex.org/W1560746966,"Agents that act via oxygen-derived free radicals form DNA strand breaks with fragmented sugar residues that block DNA repair synthesis. Using a synthetic DNA substrate with a single type of sugar fragment, 3'-phosphoglycolaldehyde esters, we show that in Escherichia coli extracts the only EDTA-resistant diesterase for these damages depends on the bacterial nfo (endonuclease IV) gene. Endonuclease IV was purified to physical homogeneity (Mr = 31,000) from an E. coli strain carrying the cloned nfo gene and in which the enzyme had been induced with paraquat. Although heat-stable and routinely assayed in the presence of EDTA, endonuclease IV was inactivated in the absence of substrate at 23-50 degrees C by either EDTA or 1,10-phenanthroline, suggesting the presence of an essential metal tightly bound to the protein. Purified endonuclease IV released phosphoglycolaldehyde, phosphate, and intact deoxyribose 5-phosphate from the 3'-end of DNA, all with apparent Km of 5-10 nM. The optimal KCl or NaCl concentration for 3'-phosphoglycolaldehyde release was 50-100 mM. The purified enzyme had endonuclease activity against partially depurinated DNA but lacked significant nonspecific nuclease activities. Endonuclease IV also activated H2O2-damaged DNA for repair synthesis by DNA polymerase I. Thus, endonuclease IV can act on a variety of oxidative damages in DNA, consistent with a role for the enzyme in combating free-radical toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W2100540626,"The transformer (tra) gene of Drosophila is necessary for all aspects of female somatic sexual differentiation. tra uses a single set of precursor RNAs to produce female- and non-sex-specific RNAs by alternative splicing. Ectopic expression of the female-specific RNA causes chromosomal males to develop as females, indicative of a linear pathway of regulated genes controlling sex. Genetic and molecular tests with this ectopically expressed gene are consistent with the following order of gene action: X chromosome to autosome ratio → Sex lethal → transformer → transformer-2 → doublesex → intersex → terminal differentiation. Expression of the female-specific tra RNA in tra mutants is sufficient to lead to female differentiation. Expression of the non-sex-specific tra RNA in tra mutants is not sufficient to lead to female differentiation. The tra female-specific activity is not required for female-specific splicing of the tra precursor RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1490400205,"A novel combination of two single cell assays allowed the simultaneous measurement of intracellular calcium concentration and hormone secretion in normal pituitary cells. [Ca2+]i was recorded using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2 and digital imaging microscopy. This technique was combined with a reverse hemolytic plaque assay for growth hormone in order to identify somatotropes and quantitate the amount of hormone released. A dynamic profile of rhythmic calcium oscillations was found in spontaneously secreting somatotropes. Each somatotrope displayed a distinct frequency (one pulse every 5-30 s) and amplitude (range 50-450 nM) generated asynchronously from cell to cell. The amount of growth hormone (GH) released correlated directly with both the frequency and amplitude of calcium oscillations at the level of single GH cells. Furthermore, calcium excursions in somatotropes were rapidly suppressed by either (i) removal of extracellular calcium, (ii) somatostatin (1 mM), or (iii) the calcium channel blockers cobalt (2 mM) and verapamil (100 microM). These observations demonstrate that spontaneous calcium oscillations are characteristic for normal somatotropes. These oscillations are related to spontaneous hormone secretion and due to influx through calcium channels in the membrane. Somatostatin, the physiologic inhibitor of GH secretion, suppresses calcium transients. These findings suggest that the intracellular signaling information may be encoded both in the frequency and amplitude of calcium oscillations."
https://openalex.org/W1512958538,"Recent biochemical studies have shown that the fibroblasts from a patient with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Type VIIB produce nearly equal amounts of normal and shortened pro-alpha 2(I) collagen chains (Wirtz, M.K., Glanville, R. W., Steinmann, B., Rao, V. H., and Hollister, D. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16376-16385). Compositional and sequencing studies of the abnormal pro-alpha 2(I) chain identified an interstitial deletion of 18 residues corresponding to the N-telopeptide of the collagen molecule. Since this region is encoded by a 54-base pair exon, number 6, the protein defect could have been caused by gene deletion, abnormal pre-mRNA splicing, or both. Here, in order to elucidate the molecular nature of this mutation we have analyzed the sequences of pro-alpha 2(I) collagen cDNA and genomic clones obtained from RNA and DNA of the patient's fibroblasts. Using oligomer-specific cloning we identified a cDNA that contains a 54-base pair deletion corresponding precisely to the sequence of exon 6. Identification of the normal gene was based on the finding of an identical sequence polymorphism in a normal cDNA and in the genomic clone derived from one of the two collagen alleles. The other gene, instead, displayed a base substitution (T to C) in the obligatory GT dinucleotide of the 5' splice-site sequence of intron 6. Analysis of nearly 100 base pairs immediately 5' to exons 5, 6, and 7, and 3' to exons 5 and 7 did not reveal any additional change. Therefore, the data strongly suggest that the observed GT-to-GC transition at the splice donor site of intron 6 generates an abnormally spliced mRNA in which the sequence of exon 5 is joined to the sequence of exon 7. Since skipping of exon 6 does not interfere with the coding frame of the mRNA, the resulting shortened polypeptide, albeit utilized in the assembly of a procollagen trimer, ultimately causes the Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Type VII phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1576101128,"DNA sequences that modulate basal and cAMP-stimulated transcription are located within the initial 169 base pairs of the alpha-gene 5'-flanking sequence. Using DNase I protection analyses and gel-mobility shift assays, we examined in vitro the domains in the human alpha-gene 5'-flanking sequence that bind nuclear proteins extracted from JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells. DNase I protection studies of the sequences between -236 and -100 demonstrate two major protected regions: -178 to -156 corresponding to an upstream regulatory element (URE) and -146 to -112 corresponding to 18-base pair repeated sequences that contain cAMP-responsive enhancers (CREs). Nuclear proteins extracted from JEG-3 choriocarcinoma cells bind specifically to oligonucleotides corresponding to both the URE and CRE domains as well as to a downstream domain (-99 to -72) that contains consensus CCAAT motifs on both the sense and antisense strands. Binding to a DNA fragment (-236 to -100) that contains both the URE and CRE domains was 10-fold more effective than that using either fragment alone. Binding to this multisite DNA fragment is readily disrupted using the URE sequence, but not the CRE sequence as a competitor, suggesting that the URE binding factor may stabilize DNA-protein interactions in these adjacent complexes. The amount of protein binding to each of the alpha-gene 5'-flanking domains was unaffected by treatment with 8-bromo-cAMP. These studies indicate that there are multiple adjacent protein binding domains in human alpha-gene 5'-flanking sequence that correspond to cis-acting regulatory elements including an upstream element that activates basal expression, repeated cAMP-response elements, and a downstream sequence containing consensus CCAAT box elements. Interactions between regulatory domains facilitate protein binding and synergistically stimulate alpha-gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1998757683,"A technique, in situ transcription, is described, in which reverse transcription of mRNAs is achieved within fixed tissue sections. An oligonucleotide complementary to proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA was used as a primer for the specific synthesis of radiolabeled POMC cDNA in fixed sections of rat pituitary, thus permitting the rapid anatomical localization of POMC mRNA by autoradiography. Intermediate lobe signal intensities were sensitive to dopaminergic drugs, demonstrating that the method can be used for studies of mRNA regulation. The transcripts may also be eluted from tissue sections for a variety of uses, including the identification and cloning of autoradiographically localized cDNAs from small amounts of tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1547039692,"Electrophysiological recordings from freshly dissociated smooth muscle cells from the stomach of the toad Bufo marinus revealed two types of Ca2+ currents. One has a low threshold of activation and inactivates rapidly; the other has a high threshold of activation and inactivates more slowly. Acetylcholine (ACh) increased the high-threshold current but not the low-threshold current. The synthetic diacylglycerol analog sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, an activator of protein kinase C (PKC), mimicked these effects of ACh on Ca2+ currents. However, another diacylglycerol analog, 1,2-dioctanoyl-3-thioglycerol, which has a closely related structure but does not activate PKC, failed to increase the Ca2+ current. The same was true of l,2-dioctanoyl-3-chloropropanediol, an analog that even at high concentrations only minimally activates PKC. These results suggest that diacylglycerol may be the second messenger mediating the effects of ACh on one type of voltage-activated Ca2+ channel, possibly by activating PKC.— Vivaudou, M. B.; Clapp, L. H.; Walsh, J. V., Jr.; Singer, J. J. Regulation of one type of Ca2+ current in smooth muscle cells by diacylglycerol and acetylcholine. FASEB J. 2: 2497-2504; 1988."
https://openalex.org/W1574082674,"The hypothesis of a channel-mediated transport of phage DNA into Escherichia coli cytoplasmic membrane has been formulated for a long time. In this paper, we present experimental evidence in favor of this proposal. We have analyzed the kinetics of the K+ efflux induced by T4 phage and ghosts (phage depleted of DNA) using a potassium selective electrode. We show that the K+ efflux is not catalyzed by the K+ transport systems. The Km of K+ efflux is the same for phage and ghosts. The rate of K+ efflux is linearly related to the multiplicity of infection. This suggests that phage and ghosts induce the formation of similar channels and that one channel is induced by one virion. The K+ efflux is associated with an influx of H+ and Na+ or Li+ which compete for entry through the channel. These ion fluxes may be responsible for the cell depolarization. The phage-induced channels allow the passage of DNA. They are only transiently opened, and their closing leads to cellular repolarization. The ghost-induced channels remain open. The insertion and conformation of the channels in the membrane depend on the temperature and their confirmation is voltage-dependent. We give an estimate of their size."
https://openalex.org/W1983774722,"A 20-base pair region in the first intron of the human c-myc gene was identified as the binding site of a nuclear protein. This binding site is mutated in five out of seven Burkitt lymphomas sequenced to date. To investigate the protein-recognition region in greater detail, the abnormal c-myc allele from a Burkitt lymphoma line (PA682) that carries a t(8;22) chromosomal translocation was used. A point mutation in the binding region of the PA682 c-myc DNA abolished binding of this nuclear protein. This protein may be an important factor for control of c-myc expression, and mutations in its recognition sequence may be associated with c-myc activation in many cases of Burkitt lymphoma."
https://openalex.org/W1862785279,"The nuclear cyt-2-1 mutant of Neurospora crassa is characterized by a gross deficiency of cytochrome c (Bertrand, H., and Collins, R. A. (1978) Mol. Gen. Genet. 166, 1-13). The mutant produces mRNA that can be translated into apocytochrome c in vitro. Apocytochrome c is also synthesized in vivo in cyt-2-1, but it is rapidly degraded and thus does not accumulate in the cytosol. Mitochondria from wild-type cells bind apocytochrome c made in vitro from either wild-type or cyt-2-1 mRNA and convert it to holocytochrome c. This conversion depends on the addition of heme by cytochrome c heme lyase and is coupled to translocation of cytochrome c into the intermembrane space. Mitochondria from the cyt-2-1 strain are deficient in the ability to bind apocytochrome c. They are also completely devoid of cytochrome c heme lyase activity. These defects explain the inability of the cyt-2-1 mutant to convert apocytochrome c to the holo form and to import it into mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2254998058,"The gene encoding the alpha-subunit of the Na+ pump oxalacetate decarboxylase of Klebsiella pneumoniae was cloned and sequenced. The deduced primary structure of the protein was confirmed by protein sequencing of about 30% of the polypeptide chain. The gene has a GC content of 67% and codes for 596 amino acids. The N-terminal methionine is removed in the mature protein which has a calculated molecular mass of 63,600 daltons. The protein consists of two different domains that are connected by a stretch of amino acid residues susceptible to proteolytic cleavage. Limited proteolysis of the native enzyme with trypsin produced fragments of about 51 kDa and 10.2 kDa, the latter of which started with valine 491 and contained the biotin prosthetic group. Peptide sequencing indicated binding of the biotin prosthetic group to lysine 561, 35 residues from the C terminus. The decarboxylase contains an extended alanine- and proline-rich region (positions 502-532) on the N-terminal side of the 10.2-kDa biotin domain. This sequence includes a total of 16 alanine and 9 proline residues."
https://openalex.org/W1551978087,"The structure of an epitopic carbohydrate recognized by a monoclonal antibody, MLS 102, was determined. A disaccharide, NeuAc alpha (2----6)GalNAc, the major prosthetic group of ovine submaxillary mucin (OSM) and related synthetic glycosides, NeuAc alpha(2----6)GalNAc alpha----Ser, NeuAc alpha(2----6)GalNAc beta----Ser, and NeuAc alpha (2----6)GalNAc beta----propyl, reacted with MLS 102 to similar extents, but the reaction was considerably weaker compared to that of OSM. This difference in reactivity could be ascribed to the occurrence of a cluster of the disaccharide on OSM. Purification of MLS 102-reactive antigens from a Triton X-100 extract of LS 180 cells by means of immunoaffinity chromatography gave mucin fractions (cMLS 102 antigen) with an OSM-like domain. Correlation between the content of the disaccharide, NeuAc alpha(2----6)GalNAc, in mucins and their reactivity with MLS 102 was observed."
https://openalex.org/W1538138384,"We have generated antibodies against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence of human von Willebrand factor (vWF) between residues Glu1737-Ser1750 which includes the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence common to several adhesive molecules. Two anti-peptide antibodies, one polyclonal, and one monoclonal reacted with native vWF and inhibited its binding to platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa, but showed negligible cross-reactivity with fibrinogen, fibronectin, and vitronectin, three other molecules that contain the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp and bind to platelets. The structural bases for the specificity of the two antibodies were evaluated by testing the ability of peptides homologous to the parent sequence, but with single amino acid substitutions, to neutralize the binding of the two antibodies to vWF. The substitution of Pro1743, the residue immediately adjacent to the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence on the amino-terminal side, with Phe resulted in a peptide that failed to interact with either antibody. Thus, Pro1743 is important for maintaining a peptide conformation recognized by two antibodies specific for the GP IIb-IIIa-binding domain of vWF. Other residues important for optimal peptide reactivity with the polyclonal antibody were Ser1742, Arg1744, and Gly1745, whereas Gly1741, Gly1745, and Asp1746, but not Arg1744, were important for reactivity with the monoclonal antibody. The epitopes of both antibodies, therefore, included at least 2 of the residues in the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp considered the common cell-binding site of adhesive molecules that interact with GP IIb-IIIa. Nevertheless, both antibodies reacted only with vWF. These studies demonstrate that peptide-specific antibodies, unlike the promiscuous GP IIb-IIIa receptor, can recognize distinctive structural characteristics of the cell-binding domain of adhesive molecules imposed by residues adjacent to the sequence Arg-Gly-Asp."
https://openalex.org/W1639466988,"Muscarinic cholinergic receptor stimulation evokes catecholamine secretion from some cell types, but the mechanism has not been well characterized. Using pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, we show that the muscarinic agonist methacholine stimulates 45Ca2+ influx and [3H]norepinephrine release in a dose-dependent manner. Experiments performed in Na+-free medium or with inhibitors of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels suggest the involvement of a receptor-activated Ca2+ channel which differs significantly from the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel involved in nicotinic receptor-stimulated release. Furthermore, both influx and release were inhibited by pertussis toxin (0.5-2.0 ng/ml, 21 h) with a dose dependency which paralleled the dose dependency of pertussis toxin-dependent in vivo ADP-ribosylation of a 41-kDa protein. These experiments provide the first evidence that muscarinic stimulation evokes neurotransmitter secretion by opening a receptor-activated Ca2+ channel which is controlled by a pertussis toxin-sensitive protein."

https://openalex.org/W2026642273,"Plasmids expressing partial-length sense or antisense protein 4.1 RNA were microinjected into fertilized Xenopus eggs. Nuclease protection assays reveal that antisense protein 4.1 RNA lead to the specific loss of endogenous protein 4.1 transcripts after midblastula transition, with no effect on the levels of three unrelated transcripts. As a control, we show that this dramatic loss of endogenous protein 4.1 transcripts is blocked when fertilized eggs receive a second injection of plasmids that express partial-length sense protein 4.1 RNA. Immunocytochemistry of tadpole embryos with antibodies monospecific for protein 4.1 demonstrates that the antisense protein 4.1 RNA blocks the normal expression of protein 4.1 in embryos and interferes with the normal interdigitation of the photoreceptor outer segments with the pigment epithelium layer in the retina. These data suggest that reduced expression of a single membrane skeleton protein is sufficient to perturb normal cellular interactions of the retina."

Multiple isoforms of the B1 molecule are expressed with Mr of 33,000, B1(33) and Mr of 34,500-36,000, B1(35). In this study it was found that nonproliferating B cells did not incorporate 32PO4 into B1 although phosphorylated class I histocompatibility molecules were easily detected. In contrast B1 isolated from proliferating or malignant B cells or B cell lines was heavily phosphorylated. Cross-linking B1 on the cell surface by antibody resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of B1 as did exposure to phorbol esters, and the membrane permeable diacylglycerol analog 1,2,-dioctanoylglyceron. B1(33) and B1(35) produced identical peptide maps following limited proteinase digestion. However, B1(35) contained both phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, while B1(33) only contained phosphoserine. In addition alkaline phosphatase was able to remove the phosphate residue(s) that resulted in generation of the B1(35) form of B1 but was unable to remove the phosphorylation of B1(33). These results suggest that phosphorylation of B1 molecules is associated with proliferation and that the different Mr forms of B1 result from the phosphorylation of B1 at different sites. Also, the finding that antibody binding to B1 generated a transmembrane signal may explain why antibody binding to B1 alters B cell function."
https://openalex.org/W1519118083,"Human fibroblasts were induced to secrete interferon (IFN) by treatment with the double-stranded RNA poly(inosinic).poly(cytidylic) acid or by infection with Newcastle disease virus. Treatment with 0.1-1 microM dexamethasone reduced the amount of IFN secreted by approximately 40-70%, respectively. A similar decrease in secretion of human IFN-beta was detected in dexamethasone-treated murine C127 cells that carry an IFN expression vector. These cells transcribe constitutively human IFN-beta under the control of a viral thymidine kinase promotor. Secretion of murine IFN induced by double-stranded RNA was also reduced in dexamethasone-treated C127 cells. The amount of IFN-beta mRNA present in fibroblasts and C127 cells was measured by hybridization to complementary RNA. Treatment with dexamethasone markedly reduced the level of IFN-beta mRNA present in both cells. The time course of this decrease was measured in C127 cells; 50 and 80% loss of IFN mRNA was observed after approximately 7.5 and 12 h, respectively. Murine IFN mRNA was also decreased in dexamethasone-treated C127 cells induced with double-stranded RNA. However, the rate of transcription of human IFN mRNA measured by run-on assays in isolated nuclei of dexamethasone-treated C127 cells was found to be comparable to that of control untreated cells. The finding that dexamethasone reduces the level of IFN mRNA transcribed under the control of both its own promotor and an unrelated promotor, together with the observation that dexamethasone does not apparently alter the rate of transcription of this mRNA, suggest that glucocorticoids may regulate IFN production by decreasing the level of its mRNA."

Therefore, the channel-activating effectiveness of these subunits on isolated guinea pig atrial cells was tested. The activated αK subunit from human erythrocytes activated the channel in subpicomolar concentrations. The βγ dimer from bovine brain activated the channel in nanomolar concentrations. These results support the view that, physiologically, the α subunit activates the channel."

https://openalex.org/W1547480096,"Determination of the nature of the antigen-antibody complex has always been the ultimate goal of three-dimensional epitope mapping studies. Various strategies for epitope mapping have been employed which include comparative binding studies with peptide fragments of antigens, binding studies with evolutionarily related proteins, chemical modifications of epitopes, and protection of epitopes from chemical modification or proteolysis by antibody shielding. In this study we report the use of protein engineering to modify residues in horse cytochrome c that are in or near the epitopes of four monoclonal antibodies specific for this protein. The results demonstrate not only that site-specific changes in the antigen binding site dramatically affect antibody binding, but, more importantly, that some of the site-specific changes cause local and long-range perturbations in structure that are detected by monoclonal antibody binding at other surfaces of the antigen. These findings emphasize the role of native conformation in the stabilization of the interaction between protein antigens and high affinity monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that monoclonal antibodies are more sensitive probes of changes in conformation brought about by protein engineering than low resolution spectroscopic methods such as circular dichroism, where similar spectra are observed for all the analogues. These findings suggest a role for monoclonal antibodies in detecting conformational changes invoked by nonconservative amino acid substitutions or substitutions of evolutionarily conserved residues in protein-engineered or recombinant proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1569191667,"Myelin P2 is a 14,800-Da cytosolic protein found in rabbit sciatic nerves. It belongs to a family of fatty acid binding proteins and shows a 72% amino acid sequence similarity to aP2/422, the adipocyte lipid binding protein, a 58% sequence similarity to rat heart fatty acid binding protein, and a 40% sequence similarity to cellular retinoic acid binding protein. In order to isolate cDNA clones representing P2, a cDNA library was constructed from poly(A+) RNA isolated from sciatic nerves of 10-day-old rabbit pups. By use of a mixed synthetic oligonucleotide probe based on the rabbit P2 amino sequence, 12 cDNA clones were selected from about 25,000 recombinants. Four of these were further characterized. They contained an open reading frame, which when translated, agreed at 128 out of 131 residues with the known rabbit P2 amino acid sequence. These cDNAs recognize a 1.9-kilobase mRNA present in sciatic nerve, spinal cord, and brain, but not present in liver or heart. The levels of P2 mRNA parallel myelin formation in sciatic nerve and spinal cord with maximal amounts being detected at about 15 postnatal days. This initial study will allow characterization of the P2 gene and its regulation, as well as further studies into the role of P2, the first metabolically active myelin-specific protein to be characterized at the genetic level."
https://openalex.org/W1840940138,"Fetuin derivatives with enzymatically altered oligosaccharide units were tested for their ability to inhibit pertussis toxin-mediated agglutination of goose erythrocytes and the binding of 125I-labeled fetuin to pertussis toxin-coated polystyrene tubes. Fetuin oligosaccharides were sequentially degraded by treatment with: neuraminidase (asialofetuin) followed by beta-galactosidase (asialoagalactofetuin) and, lastly, with beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase (asialoagalacto-a[N-acetylglucosamino]fetuin). Asialofetuin retained only 19 and 53% of the inhibitory activity of native fetuin in the hemagglutination and 125I-fetuin binding assays, respectively. Asialoagalactofetuin showed no further reduction of inhibition in the hemagglutination system and, instead, resulted in partial recovery of inhibition in the 125I-fetuin-pertussis toxin binding assay. Asialoagalacto-a[N-acetylhexosamino]fetuin showed a further decrease in ability to inhibit pertussis toxin binding in both assays. The inhibitory activity of asialoagalactofetuin could be restored to that of native fetuin by adding back D-galactose with UDP-Gal:D-glucosyl-1,4-beta-galactosyltransferase, followed by the addition of terminal sialic acid residues with CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid:beta-D-galactosyl-1,4-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosamine-alpha-2,6-N- acetylneuraminyltransferase. The data suggested that a requirement for pertussis toxin binding to fetuin may be the presence of acetamido-containing sugar groups in the nonreducing terminal position of fetuin's oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1585993787,"delta-Aminolevulinic acid is the first committed precursor in the biosynthesis of hemes, phycobilins, and chlorophylls. Plants and algae synthesize delta-aminolevulinic acid from glutamate via an RNA-dependent 5-carbon pathway. Previous reports demonstrated that cyanobacteria form delta-aminolevulinic acid from glutamate in vivo. We now report the direct measurement of this activity in vitro. Three oxygenic prokaryotes were examined, the unicellular cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 (Agmenellum quadruplicatum PR-6) and the chlorophyll a- and b-containing filamentous prochlorophyte Prochlorothrix hollandica. delta-Aminolevulinic acid-forming activity was detected in soluble extracts of all three species. delta-Aminolevulinic acid formation by Synechocystis extracts was further characterized. Activity depended upon addition of reduced pyridine nucleotide, ATP, and Mg2+ to the incubation mixture. NADPH was a more effective pyridine nucleotide than NADH at low concentrations, but NADPH inhibited delta-amino-levulinic acid formation above 1 mM, whereas NADH did not. The pH optimum was about 7.6, and the ATP concentration optimum was 0.1 mM. Activity was stimulated by addition of RNA derived from Synechocystis or Chlorella, and abolished by preincubation with RNase A. After RNase inactivation, activity was restored by addition of RNasin to block further RNase action, followed by supplementation with Synechocystis RNA. Activity was inhibited by micromolar concentrations of hemin, as was previously found with plant and algal extracts. Complete dependence on added glutamate could not be achieved. Radioactivity was incorporated into delta-aminolevulinic acid when the incubation mixture contained 1-[14C]glutamate. Activity in the Synechocystis enzyme extract was stimulated by the addition of a partially purified enzyme fraction from Chlorella. It thus appears that prokaryotic oxygenic organisms share with chloroplasts the capacity for biosynthesis of photosynthetic pigments from glutamate via the RNA-dependent 5-carbon pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1527138924,"To identify export and sorting information in outer membrane protein PhoE of Escherichia coli K-12, a set of deletions was created, resulting in the removal of N-terminal amino acids of the mature protein. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that some mutant proteins were slowly or not at all processed, but there was not correlation between processing rate and the extent of the deletions. The unprocessed precursors were accessible to trypsin in the periplasm showing that processing by leader peptidase rather than translocation is affected by these deletions. The results show that no specific sequences in the N-terminal part of the mature PhoE protein are required for translocation through the inner membrane. The capability of the processed mutant proteins to assemble into the outer membrane was correlated to the exten of the deletions. Thus, mutants which lack up to amino acid residue 14 are normally incorporated into the outer membrane. Larger deletions which removed the first postulated membrane-spanning fragment of the protein affected the efficiency of assembly: in addition to trimers of the protein in the outer membrane, also monomers were detected in the periplasm. If the deletions extended C-terminally to residue 48, only monomeric forms of the proteins were found in the periplasm."
https://openalex.org/W1527403986,"We describe here the pathways by which the alpha and beta heavy chains of the outer arm dynein from Chlamydomonas flagella are degraded by endoproteases. By probing the digestion products with monoclonal antibodies, we have located a number of protease-sensitive sites within both polypeptides and identified the regions of each molecule from which specific fragments are derived. These data also define the regions within each chain which contain the epitopes recognized by our monoclonal antibodies. The locations of the cleavage sites reveal both differences and similarities between the two molecules. The sites at which the beta chain is initially cleaved by elastase differ depending upon whether the particle is digested in situ or in solution, indicating that the beta chain undergoes a significant conformational change following extraction from the axoneme. Evidence was also obtained that heterogeneity exists among the purified alpha chain molecules. The possible arrangement of the different regions of the heavy chains within the alpha-beta dimer is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1505176270,"Abstract Myxobacteria have been shown to contain a large number of branched RNA-linked single-stranded DNA (multicopy single-stranded DNA (msDNA] molecules. In addition, we found that Myxococcus xanthus contains another smaller msDNA-like molecule, designated mrDNA, consisting of a 65-base single-stranded DNA covalently linked by a 2',5'-phosphodiester linkage to a 49-base branched RNA. In spite of their different primary sequences, the RNA-linked mrDNA is remarkably similar in secondary structure to msDNA, sharing similar stem-loop folding as well as the unique 2',5'-phosphodiester linkage. These results indicate that these novel molecules are synthesized by common molecular mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1527672331,"Polyclonal antibodies against pig liver thioltransferase were raised in a New Zealand rabbit. These antibodies completely neutralized the thioltransferase activity of the homogeneous enzyme and that in the crude cytosolic homogenate at an equivalent titer. The antibodies also cross-reacted equally with calf thymus glutaredoxin and calf liver thioltransferase, but not with Escherichia coli thioredoxin, suggesting that thioltransferase and glutaredoxin from the same species are identical. Immunoblotting analysis of the cytosolic proteins from 14 different pig tissues revealed that most pig tissues contain a 12-kDa protein which reacts with these antibodies. This protein is found in greater abundance in stomach, small intestine, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, heart, lung, and cerebral cortex, whereas retina, cerebellum, spleen, pancreas, and thymus have low levels of the protein. No reactive protein was detected in the lens. The tissue distribution of the protein was also determined by assay of the enzyme activity and was generally in good agreement with that obtained from the immunoblotting survey. Pig liver thioltransferase was cleaved by trypsin, chymotrypsin, Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, and cyanogen bromide. The selected peptides purified by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography or ion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography were subjected to reaction with the polyclonal antibodies against pig liver thioltransferase. Four antigenically reactive fragments were detected by dot-blotting analysis. These peptides are located in the first 30-amino acid residues from the NH2 terminus and the sequence from amino acid residues 39-67, indicating that the active site of the enzyme, Cys22 and Cys25, is located on one of the antigenic determinant domains."
https://openalex.org/W1530279333,"Abstract Electrophoretic uniport of anions through the inner mitochondrial membrane can be activated by alkaline pH or by depleting the matrix of divalent cations. It has also been suggested that, in the presence of valinomycin and potassium, respiration can also activate anion uniport. We have proposed that a single pathway is responsible for all three of these transport processes (Garlid, K. D., and Beavis, A. D. (1986) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 853, 187-204). We now present evidence that like the pH-dependent pore the divalent cation-regulated pore and the respiration-induced pore are blocked by N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD). Moreover, the kinetics of inhibition of the latter two pathways are identical and exhibit a second order rate constant of 2.6 X 10(-3) (nmol DCCD/mg)-1.min-1. DCCD inhibits the uniport of Cl-, phosphate, malate, and other lipophobic anions completely, but it has no effect on the classical electroneutral phosphate and dicarboxylate carriers. In Mg2+-depleted mitochondria DCCD partially inhibits the transport of SCN-; however, in Mg2+-containing mitochondria and at low pH, no inhibition is observed. Furthermore, in DCCD-treated mitochondria, even following depletion of Mg2+, the transport of SCN- is independent of pH. These results lead us to conclude that two pathways for anion uniport exist: a specific, regulated pathway which can conduct a wide variety of anions and a nonregulated pathway through the lipid bilayer which only conducts lipid-soluble ions."
https://openalex.org/W1841968233,"This experiment was conducted to develop an understanding of mechanisms responsible for effects of a compensatory (stair-step) growth pattern on the expression of milk protein genes and mammary differentiation. One hundred thirty weanling female rats were randomly assigned to either a control or a test group (compensatory growth). Early lactating mammary tissues from the compensatory growth group showed an increase in the RNA:DNA ratio, protein:DNA ratio, DNA, RNA, and protein while exhibiting a decrease in the lipid content as compared with those of the control group (2.2, 1.6, 1.7, 3.8, 2.8, and 0.5 times, respectively). Mammary tissues from the compensatory growth group contained about 1.1- to 1.4-fold more total cytoplasmic mRNA for caseins and whey acidic protein than those of the control group. The compensatory growth pattern increased beta-casein mRNA accumulation, milk protein secretion, and amino acid uptake in mammary acinar culture (1.3, 1.3, and 1.1 times, respectively) compared with those of the control group. These results indicate that the compensatory growth pattern increases milk protein mRNA transcripts and may contribute to an increase in the functional activity of the mammary gland."
https://openalex.org/W1537016369,"The omega-conotoxin receptor in brain membranes contains components of Mr approximately equal to 310,000, approximately equal to 230,000, and 37,000 as identified by photoaffinity labeling. The toxin specifically bound to two sites with apparent dissociation constants (Kd) of approximately 3 pM and 3.5 nM under the conditions employed. There was about 8 times more of the low affinity site than the high affinity site. Binding was not affected by dihydropyridines or verapamil. However, diltiazem stereospecifically inhibited the binding to the high affinity site. Dissociation of the toxin from the membranes was very slow and only partial. Among the detergents tested, digitonin solubilized the highest toxin-binding activity. The digitonin extract contained only a single class of binding sites with an apparent Kd of about 0.46 nM. Probably only the high affinity binding site was recovered in active form in digitonin extract. The properties of the toxin binding to digitonin extract were in good agreement with those of the binding to the high affinity site in the original membranes. Photoaffinity labeling of the digitonin extract indicated that the solubilized toxin receptor contained the two large components (Mr congruent 310,000 and approximately equal to 230,000) observed in the membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1528034723,"Microvitellogenin is a female-specific yolk protein from the tobacco hornworm moth Manduca sexta. A cDNA library was constructed from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from adult female fat body. cDNA clones of mRNA for microvitellogenin were isolated by using antiserum against microvitellogenin. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from different life stages and sexes reveals that mRNA coding for microvitellogenin is only present in adult female fat body. Immunoprecipitation of the protein product translated from hybrid selected mRNA indicates that the cDNA clone is specific for microvitellogenin. The complete nucleotide sequence of the 834-base pair cDNA insert has been determined by the dideoxy chain termination method. The cDNA sequence predicts that microvitellogenin is a protein of 232 residues with a calculated molecular weight of 26,201. The cDNA also predicts an amino-terminal extension of 17 residues which are not present in the mature form. This sequence appears to be a signal peptide. A comparison of the translated amino acid sequence with the sequences in the National Biomedical Foundation protein library did not establish any sequence homology with other known proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1588490842,"In pulse-chase experiments we compared the kinetics of early carbohydrate processing and subsequent secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free alpha subunit under control conditions and after treatment with 1-deoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of glucosidases I and II. Under control conditions TSH achieved resistance to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) more rapidly than free alpha (t1/2 0.3 h versus 0.9 h); however, free alpha was secreted more rapidly than TSH (t1/2 2.2 h versus 3.4 h). With 1-deoxynojirimycin, oligosaccharides co-migrating with G3Man9GlcNAc and G2Man9GlcNAc were demonstrated on TSH for the first time, suggesting that previous pulse-chase studies did not disclose these intermediates due to rapid removal of glucose residues from the common G3Man9GlcNAc2 precursor. 1-Deoxynojirimycin delayed the rate of attainment of endo H resistance for both TSH and free alpha, but there was no effect on subunit combination. With 5 mM 1-deoxynojirimycin the amount of secreted free alpha was reduced to 65% of control; secreted TSH was reduced markedly to 17% of control without intracellular accumulation, suggesting increased intracellular degradation. There was no significant toxicity from these doses of 1-deoxynojirimycin on the production or secretion of the two major nonglycosylated pituitary proteins, growth hormone and prolactin, or on at least 10 other secretory proteins. Basal differences in the relative rates of TSH and free alpha processing and secretion as well as differential sensitivity to 1-deoxynojirimycin suggest separate secretory pathways for these two closely related proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1574183181,"Poly(A)+-selected RNA prepared from cells or tissues that express a homogeneous population of either beta 1- or beta 2-adrenergic receptors was isolated and then microinjected into Xenopus laevis oocytes. Following microinjection, the expression of beta-adrenergic receptors was assessed by equilibrium radioligand binding analysis using the antagonist ligand [3H]dihydroalprenolol. The pharmacology of the newly- expressed beta-adrenergic receptors in oocyte membranes was the same as that of the original tissue used as a source of RNA. Hybridization of nick-translated cDNA of hamster beta 2-adrenergic receptor to poly(A)+-selected RNA from tissues containing beta 2-adrenergic receptors was to a mRNA species of 2.2 kilobases. In contrast, hybridization of the cDNA probe to poly(A)+-selected RNA from tissues containing beta 1-adrenergic receptors was to a mRNA species of 2.0 kilobases. A single-stranded fragment of hamster beta 2-adrenergic receptor cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 730-886 was isolated and uniformly radiolabeled. This region of the gene is predicted to encode for the entire second exofacial loop (L4-5), the entire fifth transmembrane-spanning region, and the first 5 amino acid residues of the third cytoplasmic loop (L5-6) of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor. Hybridization at 48 and 56 degrees C of poly(A)+-selected RNA prepared from sources that express either beta 1 or beta 2-adrenergic receptors to the antisense orientation strand of this region of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor cDNA was followed by S1 endonuclease digestion of nonhybridized sequences. At 48 degrees C, S1-resistant hybrids from both sources of RNA protected the probe from S1 endonuclease digestion. At 56 degrees C, however, only the RNA prepared from the source of beta 2-adrenergic receptors protected the probe from S1 endonuclease digestion. These results demonstrate that the mRNAs encoding for the structurally homologous beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors are distinct in the pharmacological specificity of their translation products and in their size and structure."
https://openalex.org/W1599803012,"The 5'-end of the bovine adrenodoxin gene contains unique structural characteristics. Exons 1 and 2 appear to encode different presequences for this mitochondrial precursor protein. However, exon 1 contains a stop codon (TAA) in place of amino acid 15. Thus, while two species of bovine adrenodoxin mRNA arise from a single gene, only the abundant mRNA species (90%) is translated into the adrenodoxin precursor which contains the presequence encoded by exon 2. The minor mRNA species (10%) contains the sequence encoded by exon 1 and cannot be translated into an adrenodoxin precursor. Presumably the sequence within exon 2 is removed from this minor mRNA species by alternative splicing. Furthermore, the initiation of transcription of the major adrenodoxin mRNA (exon 2) lies within intron 1 of this unusual gene, while that for the other mRNA (exon 1) lies in the 5'-flanking region. Thus, the adrenodoxin gene is the first example of a gene encoding a mitochondrial protein which falls into the category of genes having alternate promoters utilizing a pattern of alternative splicing."
