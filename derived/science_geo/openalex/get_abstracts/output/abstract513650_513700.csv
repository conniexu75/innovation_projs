https://openalex.org/W2081375228,"Just as reference genome sequences revolutionized human genetics, reference maps of interactome networks will be critical to fully understand genotype-phenotype relationships. Here, we describe a systematic map of ∼14,000 high-quality human binary protein-protein interactions. At equal quality, this map is ∼30% larger than what is available from small-scale studies published in the literature in the last few decades. While currently available information is highly biased and only covers a relatively small portion of the proteome, our systematic map appears strikingly more homogeneous, revealing a “broader” human interactome network than currently appreciated. The map also uncovers significant interconnectivity between known and candidate cancer gene products, providing unbiased evidence for an expanded functional cancer landscape, while demonstrating how high-quality interactome models will help “connect the dots” of the genomic revolution."

However, no mechanisms are known to cross-regulate prokaryotic and eukaryotic circadian rhythms in multikingdom ecosystems. Here, we show that the intestinal microbiota, in both mice and humans, exhibits diurnal oscillations that are influenced by feeding rhythms, leading to time-specific compositional and functional profiles over the course of a day. Ablation of host molecular clock components or induction of jet lag leads to aberrant microbiota diurnal fluctuations and dysbiosis, driven by impaired feeding rhythmicity. Consequently, jet-lag-induced dysbiosis in both mice and humans promotes glucose intolerance and obesity that are transferrable to germ-free mice upon fecal transplantation. Together, these findings provide evidence of coordinated metaorganism diurnal rhythmicity and offer a microbiome-dependent mechanism for common metabolic disturbances in humans with aberrant circadian rhythms, such as those documented in shift workers and frequent flyers.

Life on Earth is dictated by circadian fluctuations of light caused by the planet’s rotation around its own axis. Biological clocks are oscillators that enable the anticipation of diurnal variations in environmental conditions and thereby couple physiological processes to geophysical time (Mohawk et al., 2012Mohawk J.A. Green C.B. Takahashi J.S. Central and peripheral circadian clocks in mammals.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 35: 445-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). All three domains of life —archaea, bacteria, and eukarya—have evolved different methods of developing molecular machineries to coordinate this task (Edgar et al., 2012Edgar R.S. Green E.W. Zhao Y. van Ooijen G. Olmedo M. Qin X. Xu Y. Pan M. Valekunja U.K. Feeney K.A. et al.Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms.Nature. 2012; 485: 459-464PubMed Google Scholar). The mammalian circadian clock consists of several core transcriptional regulators, including CLOCK and BMAL1, which are most abundant during the light phase, as well as cryptochromes (CRYs) and period proteins (PERs), which are most highly expressed during the dark phase (Bass, 2012Bass J. Circadian topology of metabolism.Nature. 2012; 491: 348-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The circadian clock is characterized by a hierarchical principle. The central clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus is entrained by environmental light conditions. In turn, the central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through various hormonal and neuronal signals, which dictate the rhythmic gene expression of oscillating genes in most other organ systems (Dibner et al., 2010Dibner C.

In the periphery, the circadian clock controls many biological processes, ranging from metabolism and behavior to immunity, and helps to synchronize these processes to diurnal fluctuations in environmental conditions (Asher et al., 2010Asher G.

In humans, disruption of the circadian clock is a common hallmark of the modern alteration in lifestyle and is especially evident in individuals engaged in chronic shift work or frequently flying across time zones and experiencing the “jet lag” phenomenon. This new set of disruptive conditions to human physiology is associated with a propensity for a wide range of diseases, including obesity, diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and susceptibility to infection (Archer et al., 2014Archer S.N.

The mechanisms by which disruption of circadian rhythmicity contributes to these pathophysiological outcomes remain largely unknown. The bacterial circadian clock has primarily been studied in light-responsive cyanobacterial communities (Johnson et al., 2011Johnson C.H. Stewart P.L. Egli M. The cyanobacterial circadian system: from biophysics to bioevolution.Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2011; 40: 143-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition to transcriptional regulation, the bacterial clock is regulated at the posttranscriptional level. Rhythmic phosphorylation of proteins in a 24 hr rhythm functions as an oscillatory system, anticipating day-night variations in environmental conditions (Johnson et al., 2008Johnson C.H. Egli M. Stewart P.L. Structural insights into a circadian oscillator.Science. 2008; 322: 697-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, Rust et al., 2007Rust M.J. Markson J.S. Lane W.S. Fisher D.S. O’Shea E.K. Ordered phosphorylation governs oscillation of a three-protein circadian clock.Science. 2007; 318: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). It remains unknown, however, whether rhythmic activity exists in complex microbial ecosystems, some of which are not directly exposed to light-dark cycles. The mammalian intestinal microbiota constitutes such an ecosystem, whose microbial members outnumber the amount of eukaryotic cells of the host by a factor of 10. The resultant human “metaorganism” comprises both a eukaryotic and a prokaryotic component (Gordon, 2012Gordon J.I. Honor thy gut symbionts redux.Science. 2012; 336: 1251-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012Human Microbiome Project ConsortiumStructure, function and diversity of the healthy human microbiome.Nature. 2012; 486: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (6942) Google Scholar). The microbiota plays a pivotal role in the regulation of many physiological processes, including digestion of food components, host metabolism, the maturation and function of the immune system, and even host behavior and cognitive function (Clemente et al., 2012Clemente J.C.

Bäckhed F. The gut microbiota—masters of host development and physiology.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2013; 11: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar), all of which show features of circadian control. Recently, rhythmic microbial sensing by intestinal epithelial cells was found to be essential for epithelial homeostasis (Mukherji et al., 2013Mukherji A. Kobiita A. Ye T. Chambon P. Homeostasis in intestinal epithelium is orchestrated by the circadian clock and microbiota cues transduced by TLRs.Cell. 2013; 153: 812-827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that the gut microbiota itself follows diurnal oscillations in composition and function whose regulation is governed by host feeding rhythms. Furthermore, we find evidence in both mice and humans that host circadian misalignment results in microbial dysbiosis, which drives metabolic imbalances, suggesting an involvement of transkingdom interactions between mammalian and prokaryotic diurnal rhythms in modern human disease. To determine the longitudinal changes of microbiota composition over the course of a day, we performed taxonomic analysis of fecal microbiota from mice every 6 hr for two light-dark cycles (Figure 1A). All mice were fed ad libitum and housed under strict 24 hr dark-light conditions, with lights being kept on for 12 hr. Samples were taken at the time points of changing light conditions (Zeitgeber times [ZT] 12 and 0, i.e., “dusk” and “dawn,” respectively) and at the midpoint of the dark and light phases (ZT 18 and 6, respectively). We employed the commonly used nonparametric algorithm JTK_cycle to detect rhythmic elements in the taxonomic data set (Hughes et al., 2010Hughes M.E. Hogenesch J.B. Kornacker K. JTK_CYCLE: an efficient nonparametric algorithm for detecting rhythmic components in genome-scale data sets.J. Biol. Rhythms. 2010; 25: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). We detected significant (p < 0.05) diurnal fluctuations in the abundance of more than 15% of all bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (Figure 1B and Table S1 available online). Groups of fluctuating bacteria featured distinctive acrophase and bathyphase times with a 24 hr period. Bacterial genera rhythmically oscillating in a 24 hr cycle belonged to abundant taxonomical orders, namely Clostridiales, Lactobacillales, and Bacteroidales, such that rhythmically oscillating OTUs accounted for about 60% of the microbiota composition and resulted in time-of-day-specific taxonomic configurations (Figures 1C and 1D). Highly robust circadian fluctuations were found, for instance, in Lactobacillus reuteri and Dehalobacterium spp. (Figures 1E and 1F). The rhythmicity was reproducible regardless of housing conditions or cage effects (data not shown). We confirmed these results with a finer sampling resolution over a longer sampling period, with fecal samples being collected every 4 hr for 4 consecutive days (Figures S1A–S1D).Figure S1Diurnal Microbiota Oscillations in Composition and Function, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Schematic showing sampling times of microbiota every four hours over the course of four light-dark cycles.(B) OTUs showing diurnal oscillations.

Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. We next analyzed whether these diurnal oscillations in microbiota composition have consequences for the functional capacities of the intestinal microbial community over the course of a day. We therefore performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of fecal samples collected every 6 hr over the course of two light-dark cycles and mapped the metagenomic reads to a gut microbial gene catalog (Qin et al., 2010Qin J. Li R. Raes J. Arumugam M. Burgdorf K.S. Manichanh C. Nielsen T. Pons N. Levenez F. Yamada T. et al.MetaHIT ConsortiumA human gut microbial gene catalogue established by metagenomic sequencing.Nature. 2010; 464: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (7273) Google Scholar). Although the majority of genes showed a stable level over the course of a day, certain groups of genes (such as genes involved in flagellar assembly and glycosaminoglycan degradation; Figures 1G and 1H) featured a stronger variation in abundance. To test whether such fluctuations in genes belonging to functional entities follow diurnal rhythms, we grouped genes into KEGG pathways (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000Kanehisa M. Goto S. KEGG: kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (17971) Google Scholar, Kanehisa et al., 2014Kanehisa M. Goto S. Sato Y. Kawashima M. Furumichi M. Tanabe M. Data, information, knowledge and principle: back to metabolism in KEGG.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: D199-D205Crossref PubMed Scopus (2298) Google Scholar) and employed the JTK_cycle algorithm to detect oscillations that occur with a 24 hr rhythm. Interestingly, 23% of all pathways with gene coverage above 0.2 featured diurnal rhythmicity (Figure 1I and Table S1). Among these were pathways involved in nucleotide metabolism (Figure S1E), amino acid metabolism (Figure S1F), and mucus degradation (Figure S1G). These results suggest the existence of time-of-day-specific profiles of microbiota functionality. Interestingly, it appeared that distinct functional groups exhibited coordinated antiphasic fluctuations (Figure 1J). For instance, functions involved in energy metabolism, DNA repair, and cell growth were favorably performed during the dark phase (Figure 1K), whereas the light phase featured higher abundance of “maintenance” pathways involved in detoxification, motility, and environmental sensing. For instance, genes performing functions in flagellar assembly, bacterial chemotaxis, and type III secretion were most abundant during the light phase (Figure S1H). Together, these results uncover fluctuations in microbiota composition and function on the scale of hours, which follow 24 hr rhythmicity and which result in robust oscillations and time-of-day-specific configurations. The observed gut microbiota diurnal rhythmicity was present despite the lack of direct microbial exposure to environmental light-dark alterations. We thus sought to determine how these rhythmic fluctuations in microbiota composition are generated in a 24 hr period. The biological clock of the host is synchronized to environmental day-night variations by the molecular components of the circadian clock. To test whether the circadian clock of the host is required for diurnal rhythmicity in microbiota composition, we used Per1/2−/− mice, which are deficient in a functional host clock (Adamovich et al., 2014Adamovich Y. Rousso-Noori L. Zwighaft Z. Neufeld-Cohen A. Golik M. Kraut-Cohen J. Wang M. Han X. Asher G. Circadian clocks and feeding time regulate the oscillations and levels of hepatic triglycerides.Cell Metab. 2014; 19: 319-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We performed a taxonomic comparison between the microbiota of wild-type and Per1/2−/− mice at each phase of the dark-light cycle over 48 hr and then used the JTK_cycle algorithm to identify rhythmic elements. Notably, Per1/2−/− mice demonstrated a near-complete loss of rhythmic fluctuations in commensal bacterial abundance (Figure 2A and Table S2), as exemplified by Bacteroidales (Figure 2B). The rhythmic pattern observed in wild-type mice was replaced by a random abundance fluctuation in clock-deficient mice with a reduction in the number of diurnally oscillating bacterial taxonomic units (Figure 2C). To determine whether the loss of compositional oscillations has any consequences for the diurnal metagenomic profile, we performed shotgun sequencing of microbiota from Per1/2−/− mice and compared the results to wild-type mice at each phase of the day. The diurnal patterns in metagenomic pathways observed in wild-type mice were nonexistent in Per1/2-deficient mice (Figures 2D and 2E) and were instead replaced by mostly invariant levels of pathway activity throughout the light-dark cycle (Table S2). The preferential activity of certain functionalities during the light or dark phase was therefore lost in Per1/2−/− mice. For instance, pathways involved in vitamin metabolism (Figure 2F), nucleotide metabolism (Figure 2G), two-component and secretion systems (Figure 2H), DNA repair (Figure S2A), cell wall synthesis (Figure S2B), and motility (Figure S2C) lost their diurnal rhythmicity in Per1/2−/− mice. Together, these data indicate that a functional circadian clock of the host is required for the generation of diurnal fluctuations in the composition and function of the intestinal microbiota. Importantly, we also noted dysbiosis in Per1/2-deficient mice, as evident from lower alpha diversity (Figure S2D) and distinct intestinal community composition when compared to controls (Figure S2E). Some of the biggest differences in microbiota composition between wild-type and Per1/2-deficient mice were found in bacterial genera, which undergo diurnal fluctuations in wild-type mice (Figure S2F). To rule out the possibility that dysbiosis and loss of diurnal microbiota oscillations are inherently connected, we analyzed other genetically modified, dysbiotic mice and tested for the existence of diurnal microbiota oscillations. We chose mice deficient in the inflammasome adaptor ASC, a model that has recently been described to feature a functionally important and well-defined dysbiosis (Elinav et al., 2011Elinav E. Strowig T. Kau A.L. Henao-Mejia J. Thaiss C.A. Booth C.J. Peaper D.R. Bertin J. Eisenbarth S.C. Gordon J.I. Flavell R.A.

Jurczak M.J. et al.Inflammasome-mediated dysbiosis regulates progression of NAFLD and obesity.Nature. 2012; 482: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Indeed, fecal communities of wild-type and ASC−/− mice differed by alpha and beta diversity (Figures S2G and S2H). Nonetheless, bacterial OTUs from ASC−/− mice displayed significant compositional oscillations, as identified by JTK_cycle (Figures S2I and S2J). We conclude that microbiota diurnal oscillations are present at different microbiota configurations and that compositional dysbiosis and loss of diurnal rhythmicity may occur independently of each other. We next set out to determine the mechanism by which the circadian clock of the host is involved in generating microbial compositional oscillations in the intestine. The host circadian clock controls the rhythmicity of many physiological functions, including food consumption (Turek et al., 2005Turek F.W. Joshu C. Kohsaka A. Lin E. Ivanova G. McDearmon E. Laposky A. Losee-Olson S. Easton A. Jensen D.R. et al.Obesity and metabolic syndrome in circadian Clock mutant mice.Science. 2005; 308: 1043-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). Conversely, feeding times are central in entraining and synchronizing peripheral clocks (Asher et al., 2010Asher G. Reinke H. Altmeyer M. Gutierrez-Arcelus M. Hottiger M.O. Schibler U.

Yamazaki S. Tei H. Sakaki Y. Menaker M. Entrainment of the circadian clock in the liver by feeding.Science. 2001; 291: 490-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). Rodents are nocturnal animals that eat preferentially during the dark phase (Figure S2K). In contrast, Per1/2−/− mice feature a greatly attenuated diurnal feeding rhythm and consume food continuously throughout the day (Figure S2L). It was therefore plausible that microbiota rhythmicity in a normal wild-type host was driven by its diurnal eating habits, whereas the diminished microbiota rhythmicity in Per1/2−/− mice was secondary to its profoundly altered food consumption timing. To this end, we performed a timed feeding experiment in which wild-type mice were given access to food only during the light phase or only during the dark phase (Figures 3A, S3A, and S3B). In line with the ability of scheduled feeding to entrain peripheral clocks, this reversal of feeding habits inverted the expression pattern of intestinal clock genes (Figure S3C). After 2 weeks of continuous scheduled feeding, we collected fecal microbiota samples every 6 hr for two consecutive light-dark cycles. Using the JTK_cycle algorithm, we found that microbiota oscillations in the dark-phase-fed group were similar to ad-libitum-fed mice, reflecting the normal mainly nocturnal feeding habits of rodents (Figures 3C–3F and S3D and Table S3). In contrast, cycling OTUs often featured distinct phases between dark-phase-fed and light-phase-fed groups (Figures 3C–3F and S3D). Most cycling OTUs appeared to exhibit a phase shift of about 12 hr upon modification of feeding times, suggesting direct control of microbiota rhythms by feeding times. Such a phase shift was, for instance, observed in the case of Bacteroides acidifaciens (Figure 3C), Lactobacillus reuteri (Figure 3D), and Peptococcaceae (Figure 3E). We also observed cases of de novo or enhanced rhythmicity in the light-phase-fed groups, as exemplified by Candidatus Arthromitus (Figure 3F). These results suggest that feeding times influence daily fluctuations in microbiota composition and that the oscillations in abundance of commensal bacteria can be controlled by scheduled feeding.Figure S3The Impact of Feeding Rhythms on Diurnal Microbiota Oscillations, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A and B) Feeding times in dark-phase-fed (A), and light-phase-fed (B) mice.

Consequently, if feeding times are directly controlling diurnal fluctuations in microbiota composition, then timed feeding should rescue the loss of such fluctuations in mice deficient in the circadian clock. We therefore performed a similar food restriction experiment on Per1/2−/− mice and analyzed microbiota samples every 6 hr over two light-dark cycles after 2 weeks of scheduled feeding. Indeed, both light-phase-fed and dark-phase-fed, but not ad-libitum-fed, Per1/2−/− mice featured significantly oscillating bacterial OTUs, demonstrating de novo rhythmicity generation in a formerly arrhythmic community composition (Figures 3G and S3E and Table S3). Similar to wild-type mice undergoing timed feeding, the phase of microbiota oscillations followed the feeding time in Per1/2−/− mice, and oscillating OTUs showed phase shifts between dark-phase-fed and light-phase-fed mice (Figure S3E). For instance, the oscillations in Lactobacillus reuteri (Figure 3H"

We show that stromal and breast cancer (BrCa) cells utilize paracrine and juxtacrine signaling to drive chemotherapy and radiation resistance. Upon heterotypic interaction, exosomes are transferred from stromal to BrCa cells. RNA within exosomes, which are largely noncoding transcripts and transposable elements, stimulates the pattern recognition receptor RIG-I to activate STAT1-dependent antiviral signaling. In parallel, stromal cells also activate NOTCH3 on BrCa cells. The paracrine antiviral and juxtacrine NOTCH3 pathways converge as STAT1 facilitates transcriptional responses to NOTCH3 and expands therapy-resistant tumor-initiating cells. Primary human and/or mouse BrCa analysis support the role of antiviral/NOTCH3 pathways in NOTCH signaling and stroma-mediated resistance, which is abrogated by combination therapy with gamma secretase inhibitors. Thus, stromal cells orchestrate an intricate crosstalk with BrCa cells by utilizing exosomes to instigate antiviral signaling. This expands BrCa subpopulations adept at resisting therapy and reinitiating tumor growth. Stromal communication with cancer cells can influence treatment response. We show that stromal and breast cancer (BrCa) cells utilize paracrine and juxtacrine signaling to drive chemotherapy and radiation resistance. Upon heterotypic interaction, exosomes are transferred from stromal to BrCa cells. RNA within exosomes, which are largely noncoding transcripts and transposable elements, stimulates the pattern recognition receptor RIG-I to activate STAT1-dependent antiviral signaling. In parallel, stromal cells also activate NOTCH3 on BrCa cells. The paracrine antiviral and juxtacrine NOTCH3 pathways converge as STAT1 facilitates transcriptional responses to NOTCH3 and expands therapy-resistant tumor-initiating cells. Primary human and/or mouse BrCa analysis support the role of antiviral/NOTCH3 pathways in NOTCH signaling and stroma-mediated resistance, which is abrogated by combination therapy with gamma secretase inhibitors. Thus, stromal cells orchestrate an intricate crosstalk with BrCa cells by utilizing exosomes to instigate antiviral signaling. This expands BrCa subpopulations adept at resisting therapy and reinitiating tumor growth. The elucidation of resistance mechanisms to chemotherapy and radiation is an important goal in improving cancer survival. Previously, we characterized a gene signature for radiation (RT) and chemotherapy (chemo) resistance that was discovered through in vivo selection for RT-resistant tumors (Khodarev et al., 2004Khodarev N.N. Beckett M. Labay E. Darga T. Roizman B. Weichselbaum R.R. STAT1 is overexpressed in tumors selected for radioresistance and confers protection from radiation in transduced sensitive cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 1714-1719Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, Weichselbaum et al., 2008Weichselbaum R.R. Ishwaran H. Yoon T. Nuyten D.S.A. Baker S.W. Khodarev N. Su A.W. Shaikh A.Y. Roach P. Kreike B. et al.An interferon-related gene signature for DNA damage resistance is a predictive marker for chemotherapy and radiation for breast cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 18490-18495Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Because the majority of the genes identified were interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which normally are activated as part of an antiviral response, we termed this signature the interferon-related DNA damage resistance signature (IRDS). Several IRDS genes, including the transcription factor STAT1, influence RT/chemo resistance in cell lines and mouse tumor models. Interrogation across the most common human cancers revealed that a large proportion of untreated primary tumors express the IRDS. In breast cancer, IRDS expression measured by a clinical classifier comprised of seven IRDS genes (STAT1, MX1, ISG15, OAS1, IFIT1, IFIT3, and IFI44) identifies patients whose cancers are resistant to chemo and RT. Thus, the IRDS may represent a common and inherent mechanism of resistance across various human cancers. How the IRDS is regulated and how ISGs can protect against RT/chemo is unclear. A common way that ISGs are activated is through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that are triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as viral nucleic acids (Loo and Gale, 2011Loo Y.-M. Gale Jr., M. Immune signaling by RIG-I-like receptors.Immunity. 2011; 34: 680-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). PRRs include toll-like receptors (TLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors. Typically, RIG-I is activated by 5′-triphosphate viral RNA after viruses gain entry into immune and nonimmune cells. However, PRRs can also be activated through alternative routes by exosomes, which are small membrane vesicles capable of transferring contents between cells to function in cell-cell communication (Théry et al., 2009Théry C. Ostrowski M. Segura E. Membrane vesicles as conveyors of immune responses.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 581-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar). Exosomes can transfer viral RNA from infected cells to trigger an interferon response in immune cells, presumably through TLRs, to enhance viral suppression (Dreux et al., 2012Dreux M. Garaigorta U. Boyd B. Décembre E. Chung J. Whitten-Bauer C. Wieland S. Chisari F.V.

Immunol. 2013; 14: 793-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In cancer, exosomes secreted by tumor cells can increase metastasis through interaction with cells of the microenvironment (Fabbri et al., 2012Fabbri M. Paone A. Calore F. Galli R. Gaudio E. Santhanam R. Lovat F. Fadda P. Mao C. Nuovo G.J. et al.MicroRNAs bind to Toll-like receptors to induce prometastatic inflammatory response.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Med. 2012; 18: 883-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (2624) Google Scholar). Alternatively, exosomes from mesenchymal cells can be transferred to cancer to promote metastasis (Luga et al., 2012Luga V. Zhang L. Viloria-Petit A.M. Ogunjimi A.A. Inanlou M.R. Chiu E. Buchanan M. Hosein A.N. Basik M. Wrana J.L. Exosomes mediate stromal mobilization of autocrine Wnt-PCP signaling in breast cancer cell migration.Cell. 2012; 151: 1542-1556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). Thus, these recent data suggest that PRRs and exosomes orchestrate heterotypic cell-cell communication to regulate antiviral responses or to aid cancer progression. Whether crosstalk between cancer and the tumor microenvironment can use exosomes and PRRs to similarly control ISG/IRDS expression or influence treatment resistance is unknown. The importance of the tumor microenvironment in dictating treatment response is increasingly evident. Stromal cells, which are primarily fibroblasts but can also be other cell types, can promote survival after genotoxic and targeted therapy through the secretion of paracrine factors (McMillin et al., 2013McMillin D.W. Negri J.M. Mitsiades C.S. The role of tumour-stromal interactions in modifying drug response: challenges and opportunities.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2013; 12: 217-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Many of these interactions between stromal cells and tumor cells may support the maintenance of cancer stem-like cells (i.e., tumor-initiating cells) analogously to how normal stem cells depend on a niche (Korkaya et al., 2011Korkaya H. Liu S. Wicha M.S. Breast cancer stem cells, cytokine networks, and the tumor microenvironment.J. Clin. Invest. 2011; 121: 3804-3809Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Because tumor-initiating cells are resistant to RT/chemo and their survival would allow efficient tumor regrowth, understanding how the stromal microenvironment can influence these therapy resistant cells may provide promising new drug targets. The NOTCH family of receptors activates developmental signaling pathways that have multiple roles in cancer, including drug resistance (McAuliffe et al., 2012McAuliffe S.M. Morgan S.L. Wyant G.A. Tran L.T. Muto K.W. Chen Y.S. Chin K.T. Partridge J.C. Poole B.B. Cheng K.-H. et al.Targeting Notch, a key pathway for ovarian cancer stem cells, sensitizes tumors to platinum therapy.Proc. Natl.

Notch signalling in solid tumours: a little bit of everything but not all the time.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 338-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) and the regulation of tumor-initiating cells (Azzam et al., 2013Azzam D.J. Zhao D. Sun J. Minn A.J. Ranganathan P. Drews-Elger K. Han X. Picon-Ruiz M. Gilbert C.A. Wander S.A. et al.Triple negative breast cancer initiating cell subsets differ in functional and molecular characteristics and in γ-secretase inhibitor drug responses.EMBO Mol. Med. 2013; 5: 1502-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Activation requires cell-cell contact and engagement of NOTCH ligands, such as JAGGED proteins. Given the properties of the NOTCH pathway in cancer, there is a significant interest in targeting the pathway as a cancer therapeutic. Activation of NOTCH occurs through the cleavage of its intracellular domain and can be blocked by a gamma secretase inhibitor (GSI). Currently, there are multiple clinical trials testing GSIs combined with other targeted agents and conventional chemotherapy (Aster and Blacklow, 2012Aster J.C. Blacklow S.C. Targeting the Notch pathway: twists and turns on the road to rational therapeutics.J. Clin. Oncol. 2012; 30: 2418-2420Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, challenges exist that include lack of a companion biomarker to identify patients who will benefit from NOTCH inhibition. Understanding how NOTCH can be activated in subsets of cancers may facilitate their utilization as drug targets. In this study, we integrate experimental and computational models to investigate how stromal cells communicate with breast cancer to regulate expression of ISGs. In so doing, we define an antiviral pathway that is activated by exosomes and RIG-I and cooperates with NOTCH3 to regulate stroma-mediated expansion of therapy-resistant cells. Previous reports indicate that ISGs can be modulated by the microenvironment (Buess et al., 2007Buess M. Nuyten D.S.A. Hastie T. Nielsen T. Pesich R. Brown P.O. Characterization of heterotypic interaction effects in vitro to deconvolute global gene expression profiles in cancer.Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R191Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To examine whether the microenvironment can influence IRDS expression and contribute to RT/chemo resistance, we utilized metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (1833) (Kang et al., 2003Kang Y. Siegel P.M. Shu W. Drobnjak M. Kakonen S.M. Cordón-Cardo C. Guise T.A. Massagué J. A multigenic program mediating breast cancer metastasis to bone.Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 537-549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2036) Google Scholar) expressing a GFP-luciferase reporter and xenografted them with or without nontransformed MRC5 human diploid fibroblasts used as stromal cells. Tumors containing admixed fibroblasts exhibited high expression of several IRDS genes, including STAT1 (Figure 1A), particularly from breast cancer cells (Figure 1B). In contrast, tumors arising from breast cancer cells alone had lower STAT1/ISG expression and remained primarily comprised of human breast cancer cells, suggesting poor stromalization by mouse cells. The presence of admixed fibroblasts enhanced the growth rate of breast cancer cells (Figure 1C), which is a defining property of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), as measured by the rate of change in bioluminescence signal at each time point. After RT, breast cancer cells from tumors without admixed fibroblasts promptly stopped growing and showed regression by day 24. In contrast, breast cancer admixed with fibroblasts showed dramatically reduced cell death (Figure 1D) and maintained significant growth even after RT (Figure 1C). In total, these observations suggest a relationship between tumor and stromal cell interaction, antiviral signaling, and survival of cells adept at resisting DNA damage and sustaining tumor growth. To better examine the relationship between IRDS expression and stroma-mediated protection across different breast cancer and stromal cell combinations, we cocultured both cell types in vitro to model stroma-mediated resistance (referred to as coculture) and discovered that breast cancer cells can be divided into two groups. The first group, called “IRDS responders” (IRDS-Rs), is enriched in the basal-like subtype (Table S1 available online) and upregulated IRDS genes after interaction with MRC5 fibroblasts (Figure 1E). The second group, called “IRDS nonresponders” (IRDS-NRs), is composed of non-basal-like and some basal-like subtypes and failed to induce IRDS genes. Importantly, only IRDS-Rs were protected by fibroblasts after RT (Figure 1F) or after chemotherapy (Figure 1G). Multiple other stromal cell lines (CAFs, bone marrow, and fibroblasts) able to induce the IRDS were also able to promote resistance against RT (Figure S1A); however, not all stromal cells were protective, as illustrated by a macrophage cell line that neither induced the IRDS nor protected (Figure S1B). Genome-wide transcriptomic analysis from coculture of IRDS-R compared to monoculture (Table S1) demonstrated upregulation of nearly all IRDS genes in breast cancer (Figures 1H and S1C and Table S2). Stroma-mediated induction of IRDS was specific to IRDS-R breast cancer (Table S3). Knockdown of STAT1 in 1833 IRDS-R prior to coculture with MRC5 fibroblasts depressed nearly all IRDS genes compared to control (Figure 1H) and also inhibited stroma-mediated resistance (Figure 1I), a result observed with multiple different siRNAs targeting STAT1 (Figures S1D and S1E). Stable STAT1 knockdown (Figures S1D and S1E) also selectively inhibited the protective effects of MRC5 fibroblasts as measured by an in vitro luciferase-based assay (Figure 1J). In the absence of RT, disruption of STAT1 had negligible effects on growth with or without fibroblasts (Figure S1F). Thus, a subset of basal subtype breast cancers can interact with multiple stromal cell types to increase IRDS genes and RT/chemo resistance in a STAT1-dependent manner. Stroma-mediated IRDS induction and resistance requires live stromal cells and does not associate with expression and/or function of interferons or interferon receptors (Figures S2A–S2E). To explore alternative pathways to IRDS induction, we examined the transcriptome of IRDS-R breast cancer cells in MRC5 coculture compared to monoculture. Among the upregulated genes (Table S2) were several PRRs known to activate ISGs. Random forest (RF) multivariable regression analysis (Chen and Ishwaran, 2012Chen X. Ishwaran H. Random forests for genomic data analysis.Genomics. 2012; 99: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) of these and other similar PRRs demonstrated that increasing expression of RIG-I best explains the upregulation of IRDS genes by fibroblasts (Figure 2A). Accordingly, knockdown of RIG-I in 1833 IRDS-R inhibited IRDS gene induction after coculture, whereas disruption of MYD88, which is required for signaling by multiple TLRs not predicted to regulate the IRDS, had no effect (Figures 2B and S2F). Disruption of RIG-I by shRNA (Figure S2F) also partially reversed stroma-mediated resistance, as measured by short- and long-term survival (Figure 2C), without influencing general cell proliferation (Figure S2G). Concomitant disruption of the type one interferon receptor with RIG-I had no additive effect. Thus, STAT1/IRDS induction and stromal protection are primarily initiated through RIG-I rather than interferon receptors.Figure 2Stromal Cell Interaction Increases Exosomes that Upregulate ISGs through a RIG-I Antiviral PathwayShow full caption(A) Importance scores (higher is more predictive) of PRRs from a multivariable RF regression model to predict induction of IRDS after MRC5 coculture with IRDS-Rs.

Unless noted, all bar plots in figure are mean ± SD of n biological replicates. See also Figure S2. Conditioned media (CM) from coculture of IRDS-Rs with stromal fibroblasts, but not from stromal coculture of IRDS-NRs or from monoculture, upregulate IRDS genes when applied to monocultured IRDS-Rs (Figure 2D). Interestingly, CM from coculture of IRDS-Rs also upregulates IRDS when applied to IRDS-NRs. These results suggest that stromal cell interaction with IRDS-Rs produces a secreted factor capable of activating RIG-I. Recent evidence suggests that some PRRs can be activated by exosomes. Consistent with a role for exosomes in IRDS activation, the exosome-depleted soluble fraction of CM poorly induced the IRDS (Figure 2E). Conversely, addition of purified exosomes, which were confirmed by electron microscopy and by analyses of size properties and markers (Figure S2H), was sufficient to induce IRDS genes (Figure 2F). To examine how coculture with IRDS-Rs influences exosome secretion and possible transfer to breast cancer cells, exosomes were quantified by particle counting and by the exosome marker TSG101. Both methods indicated that more exosomes were present after coculture of IRDS-Rs compared to either IRDS-NRs or monoculture (Figure 2G). To examine exosome transfer, stromal cells and/or breast cancer cells were differentially labeled with either red or green fluorescent lipophilic dye to mark exosomes. For both cell types, dye transfer in monoculture appeared minimal (Figure 2H). In coculture, microscopy and flow cytometry revealed an apparent unidirectional transfer of exosomes from fibroblasts preferentially to IRDS-Rs, but not to IRDS-NRs (Figures 2H, 2I, S2I, and S2J). Multiple stromal cell types capable of inducing the IRDS were also able to transfer exosomes to IRDS-Rs (Figure S2K). Transfer was also observed upon addition of coculture CM cleared of debris and apoptotic bodies (Figure 2J). With both assays, transfer was mitigated by knockdown of TSG101 (Figures 2J and S3C), which is a regulator of exosome biogenesis. Accordingly, TSG101 disruption in fibroblasts, but not in breast cancer cells, also inhibited IRDS induction without affecting elevation in non-IRDS genes such as MMP1 and CXCL1 (Figures 2K and S3D). Thus, IRDS-Rs, but not IRDS-NRs, coerce an increase in secretion of exosomes by stromal cells that results in transfer to breast cancer cells and subsequent IRDS induction. To determine whether the increased production of exosomes in coculture primarily originated from stromal or breast cancer cells, we used a protein array of well-known exosome markers. This revealed that coculture exosomes were much more similar to exosomes from fibroblasts compared to those from breast cancer cells (Figure 3A), arguing that enhanced exosome production in coculture is primarily from stromal cells. Interrogation of stromal RAB GTPases commonly implicated in exosome secretion (Raposo and Stoorvogel, 2013Raposo G. Stoorvogel W. Extracellular vesicles: exosomes, microvesicles, and friends.J. Cell Biol. 2013; 200: 373-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar) revealed that stromal RAB27B transcript and protein were consistently induced after fibroblasts were cocultured with IRDS-Rs, but not with IRDS-NRs (Figures 3B and S3A). Indeed, of all RAB GTPases on the microarray, RAB27B was elevated the most in fibroblasts after interaction specifically with IRDS-Rs (Figure S3B). Knockdown of RAB27B in fibroblasts (Figure S3C) inhibited the ability of CM from coculture to stimulate IRDS genes (Figure 3C) but had no effect on non-IRDS genes such as MMP1 and CXCL1 (Figure S3D). Accordingly, knockdown of RAB27B also interfered with exosome transfer from fibroblasts to IRDS-Rs (Figure 3D), a result observed with multiple siRNAs to RAB27B (Figure S3E). In contrast, inhibition of RAB27A, which was not differentially expressed in fibroblasts, had no effect (Figure S3F). In total, these data argue that exosome transfer from stromal to breast cancer cells and subsequent IRDS induction is regulated by stromal RAB27B. Because exosomes and RIG-I both influence the effects of stromal cells, we focused on a potential relationship between the two. When RIG-I was disrupted in 1833 IRDS-R, IRDS gene induction by coculture CM and by purified exosomes was similarly inhibited (Figures 3E and 3F). RIG-I activation typically results from binding to viral RNA through recognition of specific motifs such as 5′-triphosphates rather than through sequence specificity (Loo and Gale, 2011Loo Y.-M. Gale Jr., M. Immune signaling by RIG-I-like receptors.Immunity. 2011; 34: 680-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). To investigate whether exosome RNA (exoRNA) can induce IRDS through RIG-I, exoRNA from coculture exosomes was re-encapsulated into synthetic lipid vesicles and transfected into monoculture 1833 IRDS-R. Whereas total cellular RNA from coculture failed to induce IRDS genes, exoRNA upregulated IRDS genes in a RIG-I-dependent manner to levels that were comparable to a viral HCV RNA used as a positive control (Figure 3G). In contrast, HCV RNA or exoRNA did not significantly increase non-IRDS genes such as IFI16, which normally responds to cytosolic DNA. Treatment with RNase, but not DNase, eliminated the ability of exoRNA, as well as an in-vitro-transcribed 5′-triphosphate control RNA (IVT5′ppp), to elevate IRDS genes (Figure 3H). Removal of 5′-phosphates revealed that the active RNA contains exposed 5′-phosphate ends and is not a typical protein-coding mRNA with a 5′-cap (Figure 3I). Consistent with the known specificity of RIG-I for 5′-triphosphate, IRDS induction was inhibited after specific removal of 5′-triphosphate from exoRNA or from the IVT5′ppp, whereas digestion of RNA containing 5′-monophosphate had no effect. Thus, exoRNA containing 5′-triphosphate activates RIG-I to induce IRDS genes. Sequencing of exoRNA isolated from coculture of 1833 IRDS-R revealed no apparent match to viral genomes from 19 different viruses known to activate RIG-I. Instead, enrichment for human intergenic and noncoding transcripts was observed in exoRNA compared to total cellular RNA from coculture (Figure 3J). In both cellular RNA and exoRNA, repetitive sequences accounted for a significant fraction of these intergenic transcripts; however, although snRNA-like repeats were the predominant class of repetitive elements in cellular RNA, transposable elements represented the largest class within exoRNA. Specifically, SINEs, LINEs, and long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons were markedly enriched among exoRNA repetitive elements, with the most prevalent subclasses augmented by 10-fold or more (Figure 3K). Other repetitive sequences such as telomeric and centromeric satellite sequences were present at lower frequencies but demonstrated 100- to 1,000-fold enrichment in exoRNA. Because transposable elements are one category of RNA polymerase III transcripts, which can have 5′-triphosphate ends (Belancio et al., 2010Belancio V.P. Roy-Engel A.M. Deininger P.L. All y’all need to know ’bout retroelements in cancer.Semin. Cancer Biol. 2010; 20: 200-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, Dieci et al., 2013Dieci G. Conti A. Pagano A. Carnevali D. Identification of RNA polymerase III-transcribed genes in eukaryotic genomes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2013; 1829: 296-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), their enrichment suggests that they may contribute to exoRNAs capable of stimulating RIG-I. Although RIG-I and STAT1 are necessary for stroma-mediated resistance, separation of breast cancer cells from stromal fibroblasts using a transwell filter large enough for exosome passage resulted in retained IRDS induction but loss of RT resistance (Figure 4A). This suggests that the antiviral pathway may work with an additional juxtacrine pathway to control stroma-mediated protection. To explore this, we computationally constructed a juxtacrine interactome between IRDS-Rs and fibroblasts using differentially expressed genes from each cell type combined with protein-protein interaction data (Figure S4A). This revealed that NOTCH3 expression was increased in IRDS-R breast cancer cells after coculture, and its membrane-b"

Using a covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) to disrupt the transcription of amplified MYCN in neuroblastoma cells, we demonstrate downregulation of the oncoprotein with consequent massive suppression of MYCN-driven global transcriptional amplification. This response translated to significant tumor regression in a mouse model of high-risk neuroblastoma, without the introduction of systemic toxicity. The striking treatment selectivity of MYCN-overexpressing cells correlated with preferential downregulation of super-enhancer-associated genes, including MYCN and other known oncogenic drivers in neuroblastoma. These results indicate that CDK7 inhibition, by selectively targeting the mechanisms that promote global transcriptional amplification in tumor cells, may be useful therapy for cancers that are driven by MYC family oncoproteins.

Using a covalent inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) to disrupt the transcription of amplified MYCN in neuroblastoma cells, we demonstrate downregulation of the oncoprotein with consequent massive suppression of MYCN-driven global transcriptional amplification. This response translated to significant tumor regression in a mouse model of high-risk neuroblastoma, without the introduction of systemic toxicity. The striking treatment selectivity of MYCN-overexpressing cells correlated with preferential downregulation of super-enhancer-associated genes, including MYCN and other known oncogenic drivers in neuroblastoma. These results indicate that CDK7 inhibition, by selectively targeting the mechanisms that promote global transcriptional amplification in tumor cells, may be useful therapy for cancers that are driven by MYC family oncoproteins. Many human cancers depend on the deregulated expression of MYC family members for their aberrant growth and proliferation, with elevated expression of these oncogenes predicting aggressive disease and a poor clinical outcome (Eilers and Eisenman, 2008Eilers M.

Deactivation of MYC in cell lines and MYC-induced transgenic tumors causes proliferative arrest and tumor regression (Arvanitis and Felsher, 2006Arvanitis C. Felsher D.W.

Recently, several groups reported that oncogenic MYC elicits its plethora of downstream effects in tumor cells through global transcriptional amplification, leading to massively upregulated expression of genes involved in multiple processes (Lin et al., 2012Lin C.Y.

Eick D. Dose-dependent regulation of target gene expression and cell proliferation by c-Myc levels.Transcription. 2013; 4: 192-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When present at physiological levels, MYC binds to the core promoters of actively transcribed genes; however, in tumor cells with MYC overexpression, increased MYC levels are observed at both the core promoters and enhancers of the same set of genes, resulting in increased levels of transcripts per cell. This mechanism provides an explanation for the lack of a common MYC transcriptional signature and for the diverse effects of deregulated MYC in cancer cells. Another general feature of deregulated MYC is its transcriptional regulation by super-enhancers (SEs), clusters of enhancers that are densely occupied by transcription factors, cofactors, and chromatin regulators (Hnisz et al., 2013Hnisz D. Abraham B.J. Lee T.I. Lau A. Saint-André V. Sigova A.A. Hoke H.A. Young R.A. Super-enhancers in the control of cell identity and disease.Cell. 2013; 155: 934-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). SEs are acquired by cancer cells through gene amplification, translocation or transcription factor overexpression. They facilitate high-level expression of genes, including MYC, whose protein products are critical for the control of cell identity, growth, and proliferation, and which are especially sensitive to perturbation (Chapuy et al., 2013Chapuy B.

These emerging insights into the role of oncogenic MYC as an SE-associated transcriptional amplifier suggest that strategies aimed at disrupting the molecular mechanisms that drive this function might provide useful therapy for different MYC-dependent tumors. The transcription cycle of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is regulated by a set of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) that have critical roles in transcription initiation and elongation (Larochelle et al., 2012Larochelle S. Amat R. Glover-Cutter K. Sansó M. Zhang C. Allen J.J. Shokat K.M. Bentley D.L. Fisher R.P. Cyclin-dependent kinase control of the initiation-to-elongation switch of RNA polymerase II.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 1108-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). In contrast to the cell-cycle CDKs which are largely responsible for cell-cycle transition, these transcriptional CDKs (especially CDK7, a subunit of TFIIH, and CDK9, a subunit of pTEFb) phosphorylate the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of Pol II, facilitating efficient transcriptional initiation, pause release and elongation. Moreover, most CDKs are activated through T-loop phosphorylation by a CDK-activating kinase (CAK), which in metazoans appears to be uniquely controlled by CDK7 (Fisher and Morgan, 1994Fisher R.P.

Inhibition of transcriptional CDKs primarily affects the accumulation of transcripts with short half-lives, including antiapoptosis family members and cell-cycle regulators (Garriga and Graña, 2004Garriga J.

Here, we investigate whether inhibition of transcriptional CDKs can be exploited to disrupt aberrant MYC-driven transcription, using the deregulated expression of MYCN as a model. The MYCN protein shares most of the physical properties of MYC (Kohl et al., 1986Kohl N.E. Legouy E. DePinho R.A. Nisen P.D. Smith R.K. Gee C.E. Alt F.W. Human N-myc is closely related in organization and nucleotide sequence to c-myc.Nature. 1986; 319: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and is considered functionally interchangeable, based on the similarity of their transcriptional programs, the cellular phenotypes they induce, and the ability of MYCN to replace MYC during murine development (Boon et al., 2001Boon K.

Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 9545-9550Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In neuroblastoma (NB), a pediatric solid tumor arising in the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, MYCN amplification is typically associated with a dismal prognosis, regardless of the treatment used (Brodeur et al., 1984Brodeur G.M. Seeger R.C. Schwab M. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M.

Med. 1985; 313: 1111-1116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We demonstrate that THZ1, a newly developed covalent inhibitor of CDK7 (Kwiatkowski et al., 2014Kwiatkowski N. Zhang T. Rahl P.B. Abraham B.J. Reddy J. Ficarro S.B. Dastur A. Amzallag A. Ramaswamy S. Tesar B. et al.Targeting transcription regulation in cancer with a covalent CDK7 inhibitor.Nature. 2014; 511: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar), selectively targets MYCN-amplified NB cells, leading to global repression of MYCN-dependent transcriptional amplification. This response induces sustained growth inhibition of tumors in a mouse model of NB. The remarkable sensitivity of MYCN-amplified cells to CDK7 inhibition is associated with preferentially reduced expression of SE-associated oncogenic drivers, especially MYCN. To identify CDKs whose depletion might lead to decreased MYCN expression and subsequent apoptosis, we performed a short hairpin (shRNA) knockdown screen of CDKs with known transcriptional activities (CDK7, CDK8, CDK9, CDK12, CDK13, and CDK19) in Kelly cells, a human NB line that expresses very high levels of MYCN RNA and protein due to genomically amplified MYCN (100–120 copies per cell) (Schwab et al., 1983Schwab M. Alitalo K. Klempnauer K.H. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Gilbert F. Brodeur G. Goldstein M. Trent J. Amplified DNA with limited homology to myc cellular oncogene is shared by human neuroblastoma cell lines and a neuroblastoma tumour.Nature. 1983; 305: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Genetic depletion of CDK7, CDK8, CDK9, or CDK19 led to marked decreases of MYCN RNA and protein with a concomitant increase in cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) expression (Figures S1A and S1B available online). To reproduce these results pharmacologically, we tested a panel of 11 inhibitors with activity against transcriptional CDKs in three MYCN-amplified cell lines, observing a range of sensitivities, with the highest potency (IC50, 6–9 nM) shown by a newly developed covalent phenylaminopyrimidine inhibitor of CDK7, THZ1 (Kwiatkowski et al., 2014Kwiatkowski N. Zhang T. Rahl P.B. Abraham B.J. Reddy J. Ficarro S.B. Dastur A. Amzallag A. Ramaswamy S. Tesar B. et al.Targeting transcription regulation in cancer with a covalent CDK7 inhibitor.Nature. 2014; 511: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar) (Figure S1C; Table S1). Similar results were obtained when THZ1 was tested against a larger panel of MYCN-amplified NB cell lines with varying levels of MYCN expression (Figures 1A and S1D). Importantly, NB cells without MYCN amplification were far less sensitive to THZ1, with IC50 values averaging ten times higher than those of MYCN-amplified cells (Figure 1A; Table S1). Notably, the NBL-S cell line, which expresses high levels of MYCN without genomic amplification (Cohn et al., 1990Cohn S.L. Salwen H. Quasney M.W. Ikegaki N. Cowan J.M. Herst C.V. Kennett R.H. Rosen S.T. DiGiuseppe J.A. Brodeur G.M. Prolonged N-myc protein half-life in a neuroblastoma cell line lacking N-myc amplification.Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1821-1827PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure S1D), was quite sensitive to THZ1, while two nontransformed lines (B6-MEFs and NIH 3T3) were relatively insensitive (Figure 1A). MYCN-amplified cells also showed enhanced sensitivity to THZ1R, a reversible analog of THZ1 that lacks the acrylamide moiety required for covalent bond formation, although it was not as potent as the covalent inhibitor (Figure 1B). The strong selectivity of THZ1 for MYCN-amplified cells was not restricted to NB, but extended to H262-BT111, a human primitive neuroectodermal tumor cell line expressing amplified MYCN (K. Ligon, personal communication) and Raji and Daudi lymphoma cells, both characterized by MYC overexpression due to chromosomal translocation (Nishikura et al., 1985Nishikura K. Erikson J. ar-Rushdi A. Huebner K. Croce C.M. The translocated c-myc oncogene of Raji Burkitt lymphoma cells is not expressed in human lymphoblastoid cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Detection of myc translocations in lymphoma cells by fluorescence in situ hybridization with yeast artificial chromosomes.Blood. 1995; 85: 2132-2138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figure S1E). To probe this preferential effect further, we tested the extent of target engagement in NB cells, using a biotinylated derivative of THZ1 (bio-THZ1) with or without THZ1 pretreatment. Bio-THZ1 consistently bound to CDK7 in both MYCN-amplified and nonamplified untreated cells (Figure S1F), but became less efficient after THZ1 treatment, suggesting that target recognition was not a major factor in the enhanced inhibitory effects of THZ1 in MYCN-amplified cells.Figure 1THZ1 Exhibits High Potency and Selectivity against MYCN-Amplified Tumor CellsShow full caption(A) Dose-response curves of MYCN-amplified and nonamplified human NB and murine fibroblast cells after treatment with increasing concentrations of THZ1 for 72 hr.

Scale bar represents 25 μM. See also Figure S1 and Table S1. Next, we studied the growth inhibitory effects of THZ1. MYCN-amplified cells treated with THZ1 underwent cell-cycle arrest in G2/M at 24 hr, an effect that was not observed in MYCN-nonamplified NB cells, even after 48 hr (Figure 1C). Moreover, THZ1 led to a profound induction of apoptosis in high MYCN-expressing cells, but not in cells expressing nonamplified MYCN (Figures 1D and S1G). Together, these data indicate that THZ1 induces selective cytotoxicity not only in NB cells with MYCN amplification, but also in other cancers overexpressing either the MYCN or MYC oncogene. Given the relative lack of target specificity of past CDK inhibitors, leading to adverse effects in normal cells (Lapenna and Giordano, 2009Lapenna S. Giordano A. Cell cycle kinases as therapeutic targets for cancer.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 547-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), we assessed the tolerability of THZ1 in non-tumor-bearing mice (n = 6) treated with 10 mg/kg intravenously twice daily. No systemic toxicity was observed even after 4 weeks of continuous administration (data not shown). We next tested the therapeutic effects of THZ1 in xenograft models of MYCN-amplified human NB derived from subcutaneous flank injection of Kelly cells. When tumors reached an optimal size (mean volume, ∼150 mm3; range, 75–235 mm3), the animals were divided into two groups and treated with vehicle (n = 9) or THZ1 as above (n = 14). Treatment was continued for a mean of 20 days (range, 15–24 days) in the control group and 24 days (range, 20–28 days) in the THZ1 group. Mice receiving THZ1 had a statistically significant reduction in tumor growth, again without toxicity (Figure 1E). Two animals remained free of tumor recurrence at 35 and 128 days posttreatment. Tumors from vehicle-treated mice displayed histological features of human NB with poorly differentiated, small round blue cells displaying high mitotic activity (Figure 1F). By contrast, the vast majority of tumor cells in the THZ1-treated animals demonstrated necrosis, reduced proliferative activity and increased apoptosis. To ensure target engagement in the tumor cells, we used bio-THZ1 to pull down CDK7 in cell lysates from both vehicle- and THZ1-treated animals, noting decreased binding with bio-THZ1 in the latter (Figure S1H). We also confirmed that the lack of toxicity in the animal models did not reflect THZ1 selectivity for human CDK7, as bio-THZ1 formed a complex with murine CDK7 in cell lysates from NIH 3T3 cells treated with THZ1 (Figure S1H). These results demonstrate the feasibility of specifically targeting CDK7 in tumor cells driven by deregulated MYC or MYCN. As a transcriptional kinase, CDK7 exerts its effects through regulation of RNA Pol II-mediated transcriptional initiation and pause establishment, while also affecting elongation through its CAK activity on other transcriptional CDKs (Glover-Cutter et al., 2009Glover-Cutter K.

We observed a dose-dependent decrease in the initiation-associated serine 5 (S5) and serine 7 (S7) and the elongation-associated serine 2 (S2) Pol II phosphorylation in MYCN-amplified but not nonamplified cells treated with THZ1 (Figures 2A and S2A). Pol II CTD phosphorylation was also downregulated in tumor cells from animals treated with THZ1 (Figure 2B). Downregulation of CDK7 phosphorylation was seen in MYCN-amplified cells (Figure S2B), consistent with the finding that CDK7 is regulated by phosphorylation within its own activation (T) loop (Larochelle et al., 2012Larochelle S. Amat R. Glover-Cutter K. Sansó M. Zhang C. Allen J.J. Shokat K.M. Bentley D.L. Fisher R.P. Cyclin-dependent kinase control of the initiation-to-elongation switch of RNA polymerase II.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 1108-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of CDK9 was also decreased in MYCN-amplified cells (Figure S2C), reinforcing the effect of THZ1 on transcription elongation. Total protein levels of CDK9 were also decreased in these cells but not nonamplified cells, suggesting that THZ1-induced CDK7 inhibition might also target the transcription of CDK9 (Figure S2C).Figure S2THZ1 Affects General Transcription and Cell-Cycle Regulation in Cells Expressing Deregulated MYC, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Western blot analysis of RNA Pol II CTD phosphorylation in MYCN-amplified (IMR-32) and nonamplified (SK-N-FI) cells treated with DMSO or THZ1 (50 or 100 nM) for the indicated times. β-tubulin was used as a loading control.(B) Western blot analysis of pCDK7 and CDK7 expression in MYCN-amplified (Kelly) and nonamplified (SH-SY5Y) NB cells treated with DMSO or THZ1 at the indicated concentrations and times.(C) Western blot analysis of total and phosphorylated CDK9 expression in MYCN-amplified (Kelly, IMR-32) and nonamplified (SH-SY5Y, SK-N-F1) cells treated with THZ1 at the indicated concentrations and times.(D) Western blot analysis of RNA Pol II CTD phosphorylation and MCL1 expression in Raji, Daudi and H262 BT111 cells following treatment with DMSO or THZ1 at the indicated doses for 6 hr.(E) Western blot analysis of the indicated proteins in MYCN-amplified NB cells overexpressing either wild-type CDK7 (CDK7WT) or the CDK7C312S mutation and treated with DMSO or 100 nM THZ1 for 6 hr.(F) Western blot analysis of phosphorylated and total CDK1 and CDK2 in Kelly and SH-SY5Y cells treated with THZ1 at the indicated doses for 6 hr.(G) Dose-response curves of MYCN-amplified (Kelly, IMR-32) and nonamplified (SH-SY5Y, SK-N-SH) human NB cells after treatment with increasing concentrations of triptolide (left) for 48 hr. and purvanolol (right) for 72 hr.

https://openalex.org/W2000564844,"lncRNAs are known to regulate a number of different developmental and tumorigenic processes. Here, we report a role for lncRNA BCAR4 in breast cancer metastasis that is mediated by chemokine-induced binding of BCAR4 to two transcription factors with extended regulatory consequences. BCAR4 binding of SNIP1 and PNUTS in response to CCL21 releases the SNIP1’s inhibition of p300-dependent histone acetylation, which in turn enables the BCAR4-recruited PNUTS to bind H3K18ac and relieve inhibition of RNA Pol II via activation of the PP1 phosphatase. This mechanism activates a noncanonical Hedgehog/GLI2 transcriptional program that promotes cell migration. BCAR4 expression correlates with advanced breast cancers, and therapeutic delivery of locked nucleic acids (LNAs) targeting BCAR4 strongly suppresses breast cancer metastasis in mouse models. The findings reveal a disease-relevant lncRNA mechanism consisting of both direct coordinated protein recruitment and indirect regulation of transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2115987666,"Endocytic cargo and Rab GTPases are segregated to distinct domains of an endosome. These domains maintain their identity until they undergo fission to traffic cargo. It is not fully understood how segregation of cargo or Rab proteins is maintained along the continuous endosomal membrane or what machinery is required for fission. Endosomes form contact sites with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that are maintained during trafficking. Here, we show that stable contacts form between the ER and endosome at constricted sorting domains, and free diffusion of cargo is limited at these positions. We demonstrate that the site of constriction and fission for early and late endosomes is spatially and temporally linked to contact sites with the ER. Lastly, we show that altering ER structure and dynamics reduces the efficiency of endosome fission. Together, these data reveal a surprising role for ER contact in defining the timing and position of endosome fission."

In all vertebrate animals studied, the homeostasis of adult blood and immune cells is ultimately maintained by rare subsets of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (Kondo et al., 2003Kondo M. Wagers A.J.

During a brief window during embryonic development, these HSCs arise de novo from hemogenic endothelium comprising the floor of the dorsal aorta (DA) (Bertrand et al., 2010aBertrand J.Y. Chi N.C.

Immunol. 2002; 2: 593-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A more complete understanding of the signaling pathways that instruct HSC emergence could in principle inform in vitro approaches utilizing pluripotent precursors to create patient-specific HSCs (Kyba and Daley, 2003Kyba M. Daley G.Q. Hematopoiesis from embryonic stem cells: lessons from and for ontogeny.Exp. Hematol. 2003; 31: 994-1006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Despite decades of efforts, this goal has not yet been achieved, in part due to an incomplete understanding of the native molecular cues needed to establish HSC fate. One known requirement for HSC emergence is signaling through the Notch pathway (Bigas et al., 2013Bigas A. Guiu J. Gama-Norton L. Notch and Wnt signaling in the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells.Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2013; 51: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Notch regulates many forms of intercellular communication, underlying many cell-fate decisions, including key roles in embryonic pattering (Kopan and Ilagan, 2009Kopan R. Ilagan M.X. The canonical Notch signaling pathway: unfolding the activation mechanism.Cell. 2009; 137: 216-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2553) Google Scholar). Although the role of Notch in the maintenance and function of adult HSCs appears to be dispensable (Bigas and Espinosa, 2012Bigas A. Espinosa L. Hematopoietic stem cells: to be or Notch to be.Blood. 2012; 119: 3226-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), Notch signaling is absolutely required in the embryonic specification of HSCs in both the mouse (Bigas and Espinosa, 2012Bigas A. Espinosa L. Hematopoietic stem cells: to be or Notch to be.Blood. 2012; 119: 3226-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and zebrafish (Bertrand et al., 2010bBertrand J.Y. Cisson J.L. Stachura D.L. Traver D. Notch signaling distinguishes 2 waves of definitive hematopoiesis in the zebrafish embryo.Blood. 2010; 115: 2777-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In mice, the Notch receptor Notch1 (Kumano et al., 2003Kumano K. Chiba S. Kunisato A. Sata M. Saito T. Nakagami-Yamaguchi E. Yamaguchi T. Masuda S. Shimizu K. Takahashi T. et al.Notch1 but not Notch2 is essential for generating hematopoietic stem cells from endothelial cells.Immunity. 2003; 18: 699-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and the Notch ligand Jagged1 (Jag1) are required for HSC specification (Bigas et al., 2010Bigas A. Robert-Moreno A. Espinosa L. The Notch pathway in the developing hematopoietic system.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2010; 54: 1175-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is important to note that, because Notch signaling is also indispensable for arterial specification (Quillien et al., 2014Quillien A. Moore J.C. Shin M. Siekmann A.F. Smith T. Pan L. Moens C.B. Parsons M.J. Lawson N.D. Distinct Notch signaling outputs pattern the developing arterial system.Development. 2014; 141: 1544-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and because HSCs derive directly from the aortic floor, it has been difficult to distinguish whether Notch signaling regulates HSC emergence independently from its role in upstream arterial specification. Recent studies in Jag1-deficient mice have demonstrated HSC defects in the presence of normal arterial development, suggesting that these Notch requirements may be distinct and separable. Recent studies have also demonstrated that Notch signaling is required intrinsically within HSCs or their precursors (Robert-Moreno et al., 2008Robert-Moreno A. Guiu J. Ruiz-Herguido C. López M.E. Inglés-Esteve J. Riera L. Tipping A. Enver T. Dzierzak E. Gridley T. et al.Impaired embryonic haematopoiesis yet normal arterial development in the absence of the Notch ligand Jagged1.EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1886-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) via function of the Notch1 receptor (Hadland et al., 2004Hadland B.K. Huppert S.S. Kanungo J. Xue Y. Jiang R. Gridley T. Conlon R.A. Cheng A.M. Kopan R. Longmore G.D. A requirement for Notch1 distinguishes 2 phases of definitive hematopoiesis during development.Blood. 2004; 104: 3097-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), suggesting that Jag1 may be a specific ligand of Notch1 in the specification of HSCs. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is a powerful proinflammatory cytokine that plays a pivotal role in the regulation of inflammation and immunity. TNFα exerts its functions via engagement of one of two specific cell surface receptors (TNFRs), namely the 55 kDa TNFR1 (also known as TNFRSF1A) and the 75 kDa TNFR2 (also known as TNFRSF1B) (Shalaby et al., 1990Shalaby M.R. Sundan A. Loetscher H. Brockhaus M. Lesslauer W. Espevik T. Binding and regulation of cellular functions by monoclonal antibodies against human tumor necrosis factor receptors.J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1517-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TNFR1 is expressed in most cell types, whereas TNFR2 is restricted to immune and endothelial cells (Aggarwal, 2003Aggarwal B.B. Signalling pathways of the TNF superfamily: a double-edged sword.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 745-756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas TNFα signaling regulates aspects of adult hematopoiesis (Mizrahi and Askenasy, 2014Mizrahi K. Askenasy N. Physiological functions of TNF family receptor/ligand interactions in hematopoiesis and transplantation.Blood. 2014; 124: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), a potential role in the developmental specification of HSCs has not been addressed. However, it has been reported that TNFα and its receptors are highly expressed in the murine yolk sac and fetal liver, suggesting a possible role for this inflammatory cytokine in embryonic hematopoiesis (Kohchi et al., 1994Kohchi C. Noguchi K. Tanabe Y. Mizuno D. Soma G. Constitutive expression of TNF-alpha and -beta genes in mouse embryo: roles of cytokines as regulator and effector on development.Int. J. Biochem. 1994; 26: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) is a ubiquitous, inducible transcription factor that is activated by a diverse number of stimuli, including TNFα (Ahn and Aggarwal, 2005Ahn K.S. Aggarwal B.B. Transcription factor NF-kappaB: a sensor for smoke and stress signals.Ann. N Y Acad. Sci. 2005; 1056: 218-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, Brown et al., 2008Brown K.D. Claudio E. Siebenlist U. The roles of the classical and alternative nuclear factor-kappaB pathways: potential implications for autoimmunity and rheumatoid arthritis.Arthritis Res. Ther. 2008; 10: 212Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A multitude of downstream targets, as well as upstream inducers, position NF-κB as a general sensor of cell stress. TNFα signaling through TNFR2 is a well-known activator of NF-κB (Aggarwal et al., 2012Aggarwal B.B. Gupta S.C. Kim J.H. Historical perspectives on tumor necrosis factor and its superfamily: 25 years later, a golden journey.Blood. 2012; 119: 651-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, Faustman and Davis, 2010Faustman D. Davis M. TNF receptor 2 pathway: drug target for autoimmune diseases.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 482-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). TNFα activates NF-κB through its canonical pathway, in which IκBs (NF-κB inhibitors) are phosphorylated, ubiquitinated, and degraded, releasing NF-κB dimers that then translocate to the nucleus to bind specific NF-κB DNA binding sites to activate gene expression (Brown et al., 2008Brown K.D. Claudio E. Siebenlist U. The roles of the classical and alternative nuclear factor-kappaB pathways: potential implications for autoimmunity and rheumatoid arthritis.Arthritis Res. Ther. 2008; 10: 212Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A direct role of NF-κB in HSCs has not been extensively studied, although recent reports indicate that NF-κB positively regulates the transcription of genes involved in the maintenance and homeostasis of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) (Stein and Baldwin, 2013Stein S.J. Baldwin A.S. Deletion of the NF-κB subunit p65/RelA in the hematopoietic compartment leads to defects in hematopoietic stem cell function.Blood. 2013; 121: 5015-5024Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), as well as their microenvironmental interactions (Zhao et al., 2012Zhao C. Xiu Y. Ashton J. Xing L. Morita Y. Jordan C.T. Boyce B.F. Noncanonical NF-κB signaling regulates hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and microenvironment interactions.Stem Cells. 2012; 30: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Whether or not NF-κB is important in HSC emergence has not been investigated. TNFα and TNFRs (Tnfa and Tnfrs utilizing zebrafish nomenclature) are well conserved in all vertebrate organisms (Wiens and Glenney, 2011Wiens G.D. Glenney G.W. Origin and evolution of TNF and TNF receptor superfamilies.Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2011; 35: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and we previously demonstrated that zebrafish Tnfa interacts with Tnfr1 and Tnfr2 (Espín et al., 2013Espín R. Roca F.J. Candel S. Sepulcre M.P. González-Rosa J.M. Alcaraz-Pérez F. Meseguer J. Cayuela M.L. Mercader N. Mulero V. TNF receptors regulate vascular homeostasis in zebrafish through a caspase-8, caspase-2 and P53 apoptotic program that bypasses caspase-3.Dis. Model. Mech. 2013; 6: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recent studies in the zebrafish indicate that zebrafish Tnfa functions as a proinflammatory cytokine by activating endothelial cells (Roca et al., 2008Roca F.J. Mulero I. López-Muñoz A. Sepulcre M.P. Renshaw S.A. Meseguer J. Mulero V. Evolution of the inflammatory response in vertebrates: fish TNF-alpha is a powerful activator of endothelial cells but hardly activates phagocytes.J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 5071-5081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the genetic inhibition of Tnfrs identified an essential role for Tnfa signaling in the development and maintenance of endothelial cells (Espín et al., 2013Espín R. Roca F.J. Candel S. Sepulcre M.P. González-Rosa J.M. Alcaraz-Pérez F. Meseguer J. Cayuela M.L. Mercader N. Mulero V. TNF receptors regulate vascular homeostasis in zebrafish through a caspase-8, caspase-2 and P53 apoptotic program that bypasses caspase-3.Dis. Model. Mech. 2013; 6: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because HSCs arise from hemogenic endothelial cells, we queried whether TNF signaling plays a role in HSC emergence. In the present study, we demonstrate a previously unappreciated requirement for TNF signaling in the generation of HSCs. We also show that NF-κB is active in nascent HSCs and that this activation is essential for HSC emergence. Finally, we identify primitive neutrophils as a key source of Tnfa, assigning these cells a previously unidentified role in HSC development. In summary, we report an important role for inflammatory signaling in the birth of the adult hematopoietic system that is mediated by the proinflammatory cytokine Tnfa, the inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB, and the Notch signaling pathway under nonpathogenic conditions. We previously demonstrated that Tnfa is required for embryonic blood vessel development (Espín et al., 2013Espín R. Roca F.J. Candel S. Sepulcre M.P. González-Rosa J.M. Alcaraz-Pérez F. Meseguer J. Cayuela M.L. Mercader N. Mulero V. TNF receptors regulate vascular homeostasis in zebrafish through a caspase-8, caspase-2 and P53 apoptotic program that bypasses caspase-3.Dis. Model. Mech. 2013; 6: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because HSCs are generated from arterial vessels in the embryo (Bigas et al., 2013Bigas A. Guiu J. Gama-Norton L. Notch and Wnt signaling in the emergence of hematopoietic stem cells.Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2013; 51: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we investigated whether this proinflammatory cytokine also played a role in HSC development. To address this question, we isolated kdrl+ endothelial cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from 26 hr postfertilization (hpf) transgenic kdrl:mCherry embryos and performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) for tnfr1 and tnfr2. Both transcripts were enriched in these cells compared to the whole embryo (Figure S1A available online). Sorted cells expressed high levels of endogenous kdrl and were negative for the muscle-specific myod gene, demonstrating the purity of the sorted cells (Figure S1B). To investigate whether Tnfa signaling was required for HSC specification, we performed loss-of-function experiments for Tnfa and its two receptors, Tnfr1 and Tnfr2, utilizing specific antisense morpholinos (MOs) (Espín et al., 2013Espín R. Roca F.J. Candel S. Sepulcre M.P. González-Rosa J.M. Alcaraz-Pérez F. Meseguer J. Cayuela M.L. Mercader N. Mulero V. TNF receptors regulate vascular homeostasis in zebrafish through a caspase-8, caspase-2 and P53 apoptotic program that bypasses caspase-3.Dis. Model. Mech. 2013; 6: 383-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the zebrafish embryo, HSCs can be visualized along the axial vessels by expression of cmyb using whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) (Burns et al., 2005Burns C.E. Traver D. Mayhall E. Shepard J.L. Zon L.I. Hematopoietic stem cell fate is established by the Notch-Runx pathway.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2331-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The number of cmyb+ cells in or near the floor of the DA was significantly reduced in Tnfa- and Tnfr2-deficient embryos compared with their wild-type (WT) siblings (Figures 1A and 1B ). However, loss of Tnfr1 showed no effect on HSC number, and its simultaneous depletion with Tnfr2 was not significantly different than loss of Tnfr2 alone (Figures 1A and 1B), indicating that the action of Tnfa through Tnfr2, but not Tnfr1, is important in HSC development. This result was supported by quantitation of cd41:eGFP+ HSPCs (Bertrand et al., 2008Bertrand J.Y. Kim A.D. Teng S. Traver D.

To further confirm the reduction of HSCs in Tnfr2- and Tnfa-deficient embryos, we directly visualized emerging HSCs from the floor of the DA in kdrl:mCherry; cmyb:GFP double transgenic embryos (Bertrand et al., 2010aBertrand J.Y. Chi N.C. Santoso B. Teng S. Stainier D.Y. Traver D. Haematopoietic stem cells derive directly from aortic endothelium during development.Nature. 2010; 464: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) at 48 hpf by confocal microscopy (Figure 1D). Consistent with the results above, the number of double-positive kdrl+; cmyb+ HSCs in the floor of the DA was reduced ∼50% when compared to control embryos (Figures 1D and 1E), unaffected in Tnfr1 deficient embryos, and showed a similar 50% decrease in Tnfr1+Tnfr2 double-depleted embryos (Figure S1C). These reductions could be due to a defect in the initial specification of HSCs or in their subsequent maintenance. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed WISH for the nascent HSC marker runx1 at earlier time points. Both Tnfr2- and Tnfa- deficient embryos showed significant reduction in the number of runx1+ cells in the aortic floor at 24, 28, and 36 hpf (Figures S1D and S1E), indicating that the functions of Tnfa and Tnfr2 are important during the earliest steps of HSC specification. We next examined subsequent developmental stages for possible roles of Tnfa in the maintenance of nascent HSCs. To determine whether Tnf receptor expression is modulated following HSC specification, we purified kdrl+; cmyb− endothelial cells and kdrl+; cmyb+ HSCs from 48 hpf kdrl:mCherry; cmyb:GFP embryos by FACS. qPCR analysis showed that, whereas tnfr1 mRNA levels were similar in HSCs and endothelial cells, tnfr2 transcripts markedly increased in HSCs (Figure 1F). As this result suggested that Tnfr2 may play a role in HSC maintenance, we analyzed changes in HSC number in individual embryos over time. The number of cmyb+; kdrl+ cells in WT animals expanded between 36 and 48 hpf, whereas Tnfr2- or Tnfa-deficient siblings showed similar numbers of HSCs at either time point (Figures 1G and 1H). Together, these results suggest that Tnfa signaling through Tnfr2 is important both in the first steps of HSC specification and in their subsequent maintenance following emergence from the aortic endothelium. Finally, we examined later larval stages by monitoring the expression of rag1 and lck, two genes expressed in developing thymocytes (Langenau et al., 2004Langenau D.M. Ferrando A.A. Traver D.

Patient R. Hedgehog signaling is required for adult blood stem cell formation in zebrafish embryos.Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 389-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Expression of rag1 was completely or nearly absent, respectively, in Tnfr2- and Tnfa-deficient animals at 4 dpf (Figure 1I). However, the thymic anlage developed normally in all morphants, assessed by the expression of the thymic epithelial marker foxn1 (Figure 1J). These results were further verified utilizing lck:eGFP transgenic animals to track T cell development (Langenau et al., 2004Langenau D.M. Ferrando A.A. Traver D. Kutok J.L. Hezel J.P. Kanki J.P. Zon L.I. Look A.T. Trede N.S. In vivo tracking of T cell development, ablation, and engraftment in transgenic zebrafish.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 7369-7374Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). T cells were absent in Tnfr2- and Tnfa- deficient larvae at 4 dpf, whereas Tnfr1-deficient siblings showed normal T cell development (Figure S1F). Together, these results indicate that Tnfa signals via Tnfr2 and that this signaling pathway is important both for early specification and subsequent maintenance of HSC fate, such that the lineage is apparently lost by 4 dpf. To further dissect the role of Tnfa signaling in hematopoiesis, we assessed whether Tnfa and its receptors were required for the first waves of hematopoiesis, commonly referred to as “primitive” due to the transience of these cells and lack of upstream multipotent progenitors. In zebrafish, primitive hematopoiesis generates macrophages, neutrophils, and erythrocytes. The expression of csf1ra, a specific marker of macrophages (Herbomel et al., 2001Herbomel P. Thisse B. Thisse C. Zebrafish early macrophages colonize cephalic mesenchyme and developing brain, retina, and epidermis through a M-CSF receptor-dependent invasive process.Dev. Biol. 2001; 238: 274-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), was unaffected in Tnfa-, Tnfr1-, and Tnfr2-deficient embryos at 24 hpf (Figure S1G). Additionally, primitive neutrophils were unaffected at 30 hpf, as assayed using transgenic mpx:eGFP animals (data not shown). Similarly, primitive erythropoiesis, assessed by expression of the erythroid-specific transcription factor gata1a at 24 hpf, was unaffected in morphant embryos (Figure S1G). Overall, these results indicate that Tnfa signaling is dispensable for primitive hematopoiesis and indispensable for definitive hematopoiesis in the zebrafish embryo. Because HSCs originate in arterial vessels, many mutants with vascular or arterial specification defects also have hematopoietic defects (Bigas and Espinosa, 2012Bigas A. Espinosa L. Hematopoietic stem cells: to be or Notch to be.Blood. 2012; 119: 3226-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). No vascular abnormalities were observed in Tnfr2- or Tnfa-deficient embryos at 24 hpf when assayed by WISH for the endothelial marker kdrl at the MO doses used in this study (Figure 2A), and circulation was normal (gata1:DsRed+, red blood cells) but reduced numbers of HSPCs and thrombocytes (cd41:eGFP+) at 3 dpf (Figure 2B). These results suggest that the functions of Tnfr2 and Tnfa are required specifically during HSC development independently of their role in developing vasculature. Thus, we could uncouple the vascular defects previously described for Tnfr2 (Espín et al., 2013Espín R. Roca F.J. Candel S. Sepulcre M.P. González-Rosa J.M. Alcaraz-Pérez F. Meseguer J. Cayuela M.L.

To address whether HSC defects in Tnfr2- and Tnfa-deficient animals were a consequence of impaired arterial specification, we performed WISH for the arterial markers efnb2a, dlc, notch1b, and notch3 (Lawson et al., 2001Lawson N.D.

Using crosslinking-immunoprecipitation (CLIP) sequencing, we uncover several dramatic changes in the RNA-binding properties of Gag that occur during virion genesis, coincident with membrane binding, multimerization, and proteolytic maturation. Prior to assembly, and after virion assembly and maturation, the nucleocapsid domain of Gag preferentially binds to psi and Rev Response elements in the viral genome, and GU-rich mRNA sequences. However, during virion genesis, this specificity transiently changes in a manner that facilitates genome packaging; nucleocapsid binds to many sites on the HIV-1 genome and to mRNA sequences with a HIV-1-like, A-rich nucleotide composition. Additionally, we find that the matrix domain of Gag binds almost exclusively to specific tRNAs in the cytosol, and this association regulates Gag binding to cellular membranes."

Here, we show that in asymmetrically dividing yeast cells, aggregation of cytosolic misfolded proteins does not occur spontaneously but requires new polypeptide synthesis and is restricted to the surface of ER, which harbors the majority of active translation sites. Protein aggregates formed on ER are frequently also associated with or are later captured by mitochondria, greatly constraining aggregate mobility. During mitosis, aggregates are tethered to well-anchored maternal mitochondria, whereas mitochondria acquired by the bud are largely free of aggregates. Disruption of aggregate-mitochondria association resulted in increased mobility and leakage of mother-accumulated aggregates into the bud. Cells with advanced replicative age exhibit gradual decline of aggregates-mitochondria association, likely contributing to their diminished ability to rejuvenate through asymmetric cell division."

Furthermore, several clock output TFs have been suggested to generate transcriptional rhythms with delayed phase relative to BMAL1/CLOCK, but these mechanisms have not been explored genome-wide (Asher and Schibler, 2011Asher G. Schibler U. Crosstalk between components of circadian and metabolic cycles in mammals.Cell Metab. 2011; 13: 125-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Thus, a fundamental question remains as to how the interaction of multiple regulators at the genome, particularly at distal enhancer elements, produces distinct phases of circadian transcriptional activity. Here, we applied Global Run-On sequencing (GRO-seq) (Core et al., 2008Core L.J. Waterfall J.J. Lis J.T.

Kuersten S. et al.Widespread transcription at neuronal activity-regulated enhancers.Nature. 2010; 465: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1698) Google Scholar). We identified thousands of oscillating enhancers with varying peak activity times, and in particular, we found that specific phases of oscillation are associated with distinct regulatory motifs and TF binding patterns. Our data suggest that specific phases of enhancer activity in vivo are achieved by a dominant regulator at each site, determined in part by sequence content, in contrast to combinatorial regulation models based primarily on synthetic in vitro models (Ukai-Tadenuma et al., 2008Ukai-Tadenuma M. Kasukawa T. Ueda H.R. Proof-by-synthesis of the transcriptional logic of mammalian circadian clocks.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1154-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we show that eRNA oscillations are highly predictive of the rhythmicity and phase of transcription at nearby genes, demonstrating a large-scale and previously unexplored role for distal regulatory elements in the generation of transcriptional rhythms. By combining circadian enhancer maps, transcription factor cistromes, and genetic ablation of Rev-erbα and Clock, we demonstrate that circadian eRNAs can be used to both identify the TFs coordinating specific phases of gene transcription and, importantly, uniquely distinguish the functional binding sites within a circadian TF cistrome. Thus, an integrative approach using multiple genomic techniques provides the most detailed and robust model to explain the generation and coordination of multiple phases of rhythm within a single tissue. GRO-seq was performed on mouse liver nuclei collected every three hours throughout a 24 hr light-dark cycle. Transcription of known circadian genes showed robust oscillation patterns, exemplified by Bmal1 (Arntl) and Rev-erbα (Nr1d1) (Figure 1A). A total of 11,288 active gene transcripts were identified, of which 1,261 (11%) were transcribed with oscillating patterns (JTK_CYCLE [Hughes et al., 2010Hughes M.E. Hogenesch J.B. Kornacker K.

Rhythmic mRNA expression of known circadian genes determined by RT-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was associated with their nascent transcription (Figure 1C), and biological replicates of GRO-seq samples at Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 10 and ZT22 showed a high degree of correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.95) (Figure S1A).

Analysis of the liver GRO-seq data revealed eRNA transcription in both inter- and intragenic regions, exemplified by highlighted regions in the vicinity of Pparα and Cry2, respectively (Figure 2A). To globally identify eRNA loci, we developed a pipeline to search for genomic locations producing bi- and unidirectional short RNA transcripts (Extended Experimental Procedures), which identified 19,086 high confidence de novo eRNA loci (>300 bp from TSS) (Table S2A). The average GRO-seq signal of de novo eRNAs showed a bimodal profile in both inter- and intragenic regions (Figure 2B). Analysis of public chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) data (Table S2B) from mouse liver suggested that de novo eRNA loci were enriched for other epigenomic features including H3K27ac, H3K4me1, DNase I hypersensitivity, and RNA polymerase II (Pol2) recruitment, consistent with the function of these sites as enhancers (Figure 2C). eRNA signals correlated with Pol2 occupancy and histone acetylation but not histone methylation (Figure S2A), consistent with earlier reports (Hah et al., 2013Hah N.

To examine dynamics of eRNA transcription across the 24 hr cycle, eRNA transcripts were quantified using GRO-seq tag counts within ±500 bp from the centers of eRNA loci. Remarkably, 5,724 (30%) of eRNAs were found to be transcribed in a circadian manner (JTK_CYCLE, p < 0.05, 21 ≤ period (τ) ≤ 24 hr, peak to trough ratio > 1.5) (Table S2C), and their relative expression peaked at different times of the day (Figure 2D). Based on their peak expression time (hereafter referred to as “phase”), circadian eRNAs were divided into eight groups (phase ZT0–ZT24, at 3 hr intervals), represented by eight colors in Figure 2D. Interestingly, circadian eRNAs were not evenly distributed across the eight phase groups. A total of 71% of circadian eRNAs oscillated with a phase between ZT18 and ZT3, whereas 29% of circadian eRNAs oscillated in other phases (Figure 2E; Table S2C). Examples of circadian eRNAs with phase ZT22 at the Cry1 locus are shown in Figure 2F. eRNA transcripts oscillating in different phases were confirmed by RT-qPCR (Figure 2G) at selected intergenic and intragenic eRNA loci (Figure S2B). The unbalanced phase distribution of eRNAs agrees with the previous finding that histone acetylation, a reflection of enhancer activity, was globally high around ZT22 and low around ZT10 in the mouse liver (Feng et al., 2011Feng D. Liu T. Sun Z. Bugge A. Mullican S.E. Alenghat T. Liu X.S. Lazar M.A. A circadian rhythm orchestrated by histone deacetylase 3 controls hepatic lipid metabolism.Science. 2011; 331: 1315-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Moreover, the average H3K27ac level at eight groups of eRNA loci showed the same oscillatory pattern as the circadian eRNAs within each group (Figure S2C). Therefore, circadian eRNAs oscillate in diverse phases, suggesting that circadian enhancer activities are orchestrated by distinct mechanisms in liver. We have shown that gene body and eRNA transcription occur in multiple phases. As previous studies suggested correlated transcription of eRNA and nearby target genes (Core et al., 2008Core L.J.

The expression of genes mapped closest to oscillating eRNAs (within 200 kb from TSS) showed rhythmic patterns in phase with eRNA expression (Figure 3A). Among all genes mapped to circadian eRNAs, 423 (34%) circadian gene transcripts were mapped to 1,124 (20%) circadian enhancers and oscillation phases between each enhancer-gene pair were highly correlated (r = 0.9) (Figure S3A). This is likely an underestimate based on the stringent eRNA-gene mapping criteria and, indeed, if the analysis is not limited to the nearest gene, up to 76% of circadian genes in different phases have in-phase eRNAs (phase difference <3 hr between gene and eRNA) located within 200 kb of their TSSs. By contrast, for random genes this number is ∼10% on average (hypergeometric test, p < 0.001) (Figure S3B). Together, these results suggest that circadian eRNAs predict rhythmic transcription of nearby genes and are likely to be functionally associated with circadian genes of the same phase.Figure S3Phase-Specific Transcription Factors at Circadian Enhancers, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Phase correlation between oscillating eRNAs and closest oscillating genes.

Although gene body and eRNA transcription occur in multiple phases, the core clock oscillator in liver has only one peak and one trough in a 24 hr period (Koike et al., 2012Koike N. Yoo S.H.

Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals.Science. 2012; 338: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that specific circadian TFs were responsible for the different phases of gene expression by driving the transcription of diversely phased eRNAs. To this end, we performed motif analysis on the eight groups of circadian enhancers using 500 bp windows centered on each eRNA locus (Figure S3C). First, candidate phase-specific TFs with the most enriched motifs in each enhancer group were selected by de novo motif mining (Table S3). Then, annotated motifs of candidate TFs were used to quantify the motif enrichment in each enhancer group, revealing four major types of motifs specifically enriched in six enhancer groups (Figure 3B). Specifically, an E-box motif was the most enriched at circadian eRNA loci in phase ZT6–ZT9, coincident with the peak of BMAL1 binding to the genome (Koike et al., 2012Koike N. Yoo S.H. Huang H.C.

However, although BMAL1/CLOCK has been previously linked to circadian gene regulation in liver, the ZT6–ZT9 eRNAs comprised only ∼6% of circadian enhancers, consistent with an earlier study in which only ∼5% of total circadian genes were transcribed in phase with nearby BMAL1 binding (Menet et al., 2012Menet J.S.

By contrast, motifs characteristic of ETS binding sites were highly enriched in the phase ZT0–ZT3 enhancers, implying a potential role of ETS proteins in the circadian regulation of transcripts with this phase (Figure 3B). In addition to these phase-specific motifs, constitutively enriched motifs in all enhancer groups were identified, most prominently the Forkhead and HNF4 motifs (Figure 3B). We tested whether the motif enrichment in a given eRNA group was predictive of TF binding by overlapping each group of circadian eRNAs with TF cistromes determined by ChIP-seq. Specifically, we analyzed previously published cistrome data for core clock TFs (Feng et al., 2011Feng D. Liu T. Sun Z. Bugge A. Mullican S.E. Alenghat T. Liu X.S.

To minimize the effects of variable ChIP-seq quality in different studies, only the 3,000 strongest ChIP-seq peaks for each TF were used in the analysis. Notably, the genomic binding sites of E-box-binding factors BMAL1, CLOCK, and NPAS2 were enriched at eRNAs with phase ZT6–ZT9 (Figure 3C), where de novo analysis implicated the E-box motif.

Here, we identify a plethora of putative OR enhancers and study their in vivo activity in olfactory neurons. Distinguished by an unusual epigenetic signature, candidate OR enhancers are characterized by extensive interchromosomal interactions associated with OR transcription and share a similar pattern of transcription factor footprints. In particular, we establish the role of the transcription factor Bptf as a facilitator of both enhancer interactions and OR transcription. Our observations agree with the model whereby OR transcription occurs in the context of multiple interacting enhancers. Disruption of these interchromosomal interactions results in weak and multigenic OR expression, suggesting that the rare coincidence of numerous enhancers over a stochastically chosen OR may account for the singularity and robustness in OR transcription."

Our findings demonstrate a specific function for RACK1 in selective mRNA translation and uncover a target for the development of broad antiviral intervention. Viral infections are a significant threat for all living organisms. In humans, acute and chronic viral infections cause a wide spectrum of diseases, including life-threatening inflammation and cancer. A major challenge for the control of viral infections is that viruses, due to the small size of their genomes, offer few intrinsic targets either for recognition by the immune system or for inhibition by antiviral effector molecules. Furthermore, the error-prone viral polymerases allow RNA viruses to rapidly escape detection by the immune system and to resist the adverse effects of directly acting antiviral molecules. Significantly, viruses rely on numerous host factors for essential functions during their life cycle. These are not subject to rapid sequence changes and hence provide good alternative targets for antiviral therapy. Therefore, a central challenge is to identify cellular factors required for viral replication but dispensable for normal cell function. RNA replication, transcription, and translation are critical steps in the life cycle of RNA viruses that involve interactions with host-cell molecules. In the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, the small interfering RNA (siRNA) pathway targets viral RNAs (reviewed in Ding, 2010Ding S.W. RNA-based antiviral immunity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2010; 10: 632-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar]). In order to better characterize the contribution of the three core components of this pathway, Dicer-2, R2D2, and AGO2, we performed a proteomic analysis of the complexes assembling around these molecules in infected Drosophila cells (K.M., J.-L.I., Y.V., and J.V., unpublished data). One protein copurifying with R2D2 and AGO2 in cells infected with the picorna-like Drosophila C virus (DCV) was the evolutionarily conserved ribosomal protein RACK1. The RACK1 protein has been extensively studied during the last two decades and has been shown to be involved in different aspects of cell regulation. RACK1 is an adaptor protein, interacting with a variety of signaling molecules (e.g., PKC, Src, and MAPK) (Belozerov et al., 2014Belozerov V.E. Ratkovic S. McNeill H. Hilliker A.J. McDermott J.C.

Identification of the versatile scaffold protein RACK1 on the eukaryotic ribosome by cryo-EM.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). RACK1 is thus ideally suited to connect signal transduction pathways to the regulation of translation (Nilsson et al., 2004Nilsson J. Sengupta J. Frank J. Nissen P. Regulation of eukaryotic translation by the RACK1 protein: a platform for signalling molecules on the ribosome.EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 1137-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Indeed, RACK1 was found to interact with the initiation factor eIF6, which associates with the 60S subunit of the ribosome and prevents its association with the 40S subunit. eIF6 phosphorylation by RACK1-assisted PKC triggers its release from the 60S subunit, thus promoting the formation of 80S active ribosomes (Ceci et al., 2003Ceci M. Gaviraghi C. Gorrini C. Sala L.A. Offenhäuser N. Marchisio P.C. Biffo S. Release of eIF6 (p27BBP) from the 60S subunit allows 80S ribosome assembly.Nature. 2003; 426: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Here, we show that RACK1 is mandatory for DCV replication but is largely dispensable for cell viability and proliferation. We further demonstrate that RACK1 is required for internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation in Drosophila and in human hepatocytes, where this factor is an essential determinant of hepatitis C virus infection. By contrast, RACK1 is not required for 5′ cap-dependent translation. Collectively, our data unravel a specific function for ribosomal protein RACK1 in selective mRNA translation of fly and human viruses and uncover a target for the development of broad antiviral intervention. In a proteomic analysis of the interactome of Dicer-2, R2D2, and AGO2 in virus-infected cells (K.M., J.-L.I., Y.V., and J.V., unpublished data), we identified 16 ribosomal proteins. To address the functional relevance of this finding, we systematically depleted these ribosomal proteins from S2 cells by RNAi and tested DCV replication. Knockdown of most ribosomal genes affected cell viability or proliferation and did not yield interpretable results regarding DCV infection (Figures 1A and 1B ). Indeed, silencing of these genes may result in decreased ability of the cells either to support viral replication or to control the infection. By contrast, depletion of RACK1 (Figure S1A available online) did not affect cell viability or proliferation in S2 cells (Figures 1B and 1C) or in two other cell lines (Figure S1B). However, it resulted in a significant decrease of DCV titer in infected cells (Figure 1A). Furthermore, RACK1 silencing did not affect replication of either flock house virus (FHV) or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Figures 2A and 2B ), indicating that the RACK1-depleted cells are not only viable and able to proliferate but can also support replication of other viruses. To test whether the effect of RACK1 was specific to DCV or to the family to which it belongs, we infected S2 cells with Cricket Paralysis Virus (CrPV), another member of the Dicistroviridae family. Replication of CrPV was also strongly impaired when RACK1 was depleted (Figure 2B).Figure S1Silencing RACK1 Expression in Tissue Culture Cells and In Vivo, Related to Figures 1, 2, and 3Show full caption(A) Western blot analysis of RACK1 protein expression using specific anti-RACK1 antibodies after treatment of S2 cells with the indicated dsRNAs.

We next confirmed these findings in vivo. RACK1 null mutant flies are not viable, indicating that RACK1 exerts developmental functions (Kadrmas et al., 2007Kadrmas J.L. Smith M.A. Pronovost S.M. Beckerle M.C. Characterization of RACK1 function in Drosophila development.Dev. Dyn. 2007; 236: 2207-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In agreement with this finding, silencing RACK1 expression with a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) driven by the broadly active actin5C promoter was embryonic lethal. When the thermosensitive Gal80 system was used to express the shRNA only in adult flies, development occurred normally and the adult flies expressed significantly reduced levels of RACK1 at the permissive temperature of 29°C (Figure 2C). The reduced levels of RACK1 did not affect the viability of the flies, although it reduced longevity by 20% at this temperature. In addition, the eggs laid by RACK1-silenced females showed a phenotype similar to that of RACK1 mutants (Figure S1C) (Kadrmas et al., 2007Kadrmas J.L. Smith M.A. Pronovost S.M. Beckerle M.C. Characterization of RACK1 function in Drosophila development.Dev. Dyn. 2007; 236: 2207-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, even though RACK1 is required during development, it appears to be largely dispensable in adult flies. As expected, when these flies were challenged with DCV, both viral RNA and capsid protein levels were markedly reduced at 1 and 2 days postinfection compared to controls (Figure 2D). Overall, our data indicate that replication of the Dicistroviridae DCV and CrPV requires the ribosomal factor RACK1, which is otherwise dispensable for the viability of S2 cells and adult flies. Our data indicate that RACK1 is required for a step of viral replication specific to Dicistroviridae. Whereas FHV and VSV use a canonical strategy of cap-dependent initiation of translation, DCV and CrPV RNA recruits the 40S ribosomal subunit through IRES sequences to initiate translation (Figure S2A). Furthermore, although initially identified as a scaffolding protein involved in protein kinase C signaling, RACK1 is now recognized as a component of the 40S subunit of the ribosome. This suggested to us that RACK1 was required for viral translation. We first verified that RACK1 is indeed required at the ribosome level for CrPV replication. We silenced RACK1 expression in a stable cell line using an shRNA targeting the 5′ UTR (Figure S1D) and observed a marked decrease in CrPV replication (Figure S1E). Transfection of a vector expressing wild-type RACK1 restored CrPV replication in these cells (Figure 3A). By contrast, expression of mutant proteins unable to interact with either RpS17 (D108Y) (Kuroha et al., 2010Kuroha K. Akamatsu M. Dimitrova L. Ito T. Kato Y. Shirahige K. Inada T. Receptor for activated C kinase 1 stimulates nascent polypeptide-dependent translation arrest.EMBO Rep. 2010; 11: 956-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) or 18S rRNA (R38D/K40E) (Coyle et al., 2009Coyle S.M.

Biol. 2009; 29: 1626-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) did not rescue CrPV replication (Figure 3A). We conclude that RACK1 is required in the 40S ribosomal subunit for CrPV replication.Figure 3The Ribosomal Protein RACK1 Is Required for IRES-Mediated TranslationShow full caption(A) Stable S2 transformants expressing a shRNA targeting the 5′ UTR of RACK1 were transfected with vectors expressing three versions of RACK1 (WT, D108Y, or R38D/K40E).

(B) RACK1 is required for translation regulated by the 5′ IRES, but not the IGR IRES, of CrPV. S2 cells were treated with dsRNAs corresponding to GFP (control), AGO2, eIF4E, or RACK1 for 3 days before transfection of the indicated Luciferase reporters (5′CAP, IRESCrPV-IGR, or IRESCrPV-5′; see Figure S2). Luciferase activity was monitored 48 hr later. The ratio of the activity of the IRES-dependent luciferase and the 5′ cap-dependent luciferase is plotted and normalized to the control for the three reporters. Data represent the mean and SD from six independent experiments. (C) Polysome profiles from S2 cells expressing or not expressing a shRNA targeting the 5′ UTR of RACK1.

Data represent the mean and SD from three independent experiments. ns, nonsignificant; ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗p < 0.01. See also Figures S2 and S3. To confirm that RACK1 is involved in translation from Dicistroviridae RNAs, we tested whether its depletion affected translation of luciferase reporters placed under the control of the two IRES elements from CrPV (Figures 3B and S2C). Translation of a 5′ cap-dependent RNA was not affected in the absence of RACK1, although it was affected when expression of eIF4E was knocked down. Translation from the CrPV 5′ IRES reporter was not reduced, and was even slightly increased, when eIF4E was silenced, suggesting that the 5′ IRES drives noncanonical translation. Interestingly, a significant reduction of luciferase production was observed for the 5′ IRES reporter in RACK1-silenced cells (Figure 3B). Silencing of RACK1 did not affect the amount of the 5′ IRES reporter luciferase mRNA in the cells, indicating that RACK1 affects translation, rather than RNA stability (Figure S3). By contrast, translation driven by the intergenic (IGR) IRES (Jan and Sarnow, 2002Jan E. Sarnow P. Factorless ribosome assembly on the internal ribosome entry site of cricket paralysis virus.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 889-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, Spahn et al., 2004Spahn C.M. Jan E. Mulder A. Grassucci R.A. Sarnow P. Frank J.

Polysome profiles from S2 cells and RACK1-silenced stable derivatives of these cells (Figure S1D) were similar, confirming that RACK1 does not affect significantly general translation (Figure 3C). Finally, we prepared cell-free translation extracts from control and RACK1-depleted S2 cells and used them to monitor translation of in-vitro-transcribed, capped, and IRES-dependent RNAs. Translation of the 5′ IRES reporter RNA was strongly reduced in the RACK1 depleted extract. By contrast, translation of the 5′ CAP and IGR IRES-dependent reporters was not inhibited and was even slightly stimulated (Figure 3D). Overall, our data indicate that ribosomal RACK1 is required for IRES-dependent translation of Dicistroviridae both ex vivo and in vitro. RACK1 is an evolutionarily strongly conserved factor, and we asked whether it plays a role in the translation driven by the IRES of a mammalian virus. Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major cause of liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, is a positive strand RNA virus member of the Flaviviridae family depending on a highly structured IRES for its translation (Figure S2) (Spahn et al., 2001Spahn C.M.

Hepatitis C virus IRES RNA-induced changes in the conformation of the 40s ribosomal subunit.Science. 2001; 291: 1959-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Transfection of an siRNA targeting RACK1 markedly reduced expression of the protein in Huh7.5.1 cells (Figure 4A), a human hepatocyte-derived cell line highly permissive for HCV infection (Lindenbach et al., 2005Lindenbach B.D. Evans M.J. Syder A.J. Wölk B. Tellinghuisen T.L. Liu C.C. Maruyama T. Hynes R.O. Burton D.R. McKeating J.A. Rice C.M.

Med. 2005; 11: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (2415) Google Scholar). Infection of RACK1-depleted Huh7.5.1 cells by cell-culture-derived HCV (Jc1 strain) was strongly and significantly reduced, as revealed both by immunodetection of the viral core protein (Figure 4A) and the focus-forming assay performed by infection of naive Huh7.5.1 cells with supernatants from infected and treated cells (Figure 4B). A similar inhibition of infection was observed for HCV Luc-Jc1 (Figure 4C), a well-characterized recombinant virus expressing a luciferase reporter (Figure S2B). Inhibition of RACK1 expression was as efficient as the silencing of the key HCV host factors CD81 (Koutsoudakis et al., 2007Koutsoudakis G. Herrmann E. Kallis S. Bartenschlager R. Pietschmann T. The level of CD81 cell surface expression is a key determinant for productive entry of hepatitis C virus into host cells.J.

We next transiently depleted RACK1 in Huh7.5.1 cells replicating the reporter virus HCV Luc-Jc1 and observed a marked impairment of HCV replication (Figure 4D), demonstrating that RACK1 is required for HCV translation/replication rather than entry. HCV replication rebound observed after day 4 was due to progressive loss of RACK1 silencing, leading to neosynthesis of RACK1 (Figure S4A).Figure S4Silencing of RACK1 Does Not Affect Proliferation of Huh7.5.1 Cells, Related to Figure 4Show full caption(A) Western blot analysis showing RACK1 recovery after silencing.

Huh7.5.1 cells cultured in a serum-depleted medium (2% FBS) were used as a control, and were the only population exhibiting decreased loss of fluorescence, indicative of reduced cell division. To confirm that the inhibition of HCV replication is indeed mediated by the effect of RACK1 on IRES-mediated translation, we established stable cell lines expressing an IRESHCV-luciferase reporter construct or a classical capped reporter gene (Figure S2C) and transfected these cells with RACK1-specific siRNAs. Silencing of RACK1 markedly and specifically decreased IRESHCV-dependent translation to a similar extent as an antiviral siRNA directed against the IRESHCV (Figure 4E). By contrast, silencing of ribosomal protein RPS3 inhibited translation from both IRES- and 5′ cap-dependent reporter constructs (Figure 4E). Similar results were obtained when in-vitro-transcribed reporter mRNAs were transfected into Huh7.5.1 cells, ruling out an effect of RACK1 on transcription of the IRESHCV-luciferase reporter gene (Figure 4F). Importantly, RACK1-specific siRNAs did not affect cell proliferation (Figure S4B) or viability, in contrast to silencing of the ribosomal protein RPS3 (Figure 4G). A genome-wide microarray analysis of polysomes prepared from control or RACK1-silenced human Huh7.5.1 cells revealed that the amount in polysomes of mRNAs for most genes, including house-keeping genes and important hepatocyte-specific genes such as albumin or lipoproteins, was not affected by RACK1 depletion (Figure 4H). Of note, silencing of RACK1 also did not affect the presence of 5′ terminal oligopyrimidine tract (TOP) mRNAs in polysomes (for details, see Supplemental Information). This result suggests that translation of the large majority of mRNAs is not affected by the absence of RACK1 in human hepatocytes under normal culture conditions and confirms the results obtained in the model organism Drosophila. While this work was in progress, a role for RACK1 in miRNA function was reported in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Speth et al., 2013Speth C. Willing E.-M. Rausch S. Schneeberger K. Laubinger S.

Replication of eukaryotic genomes follows a strict temporal program with each chromosome containing segments of characteristic early and late replication. This program is mediated by the locations and activation timing of replication origins along each chromosome (Rhind and Gilbert, 2013Rhind N. Gilbert D.M. DNA replication timing.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a010132Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Expressed genes tend to reside in early-replicating region of the genome (Rhind and Gilbert, 2013Rhind N. Gilbert D.M. DNA replication timing.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a010132Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Compared to early phases of replication, late phases of replication are faster, less structured (Koren and McCarroll, 2014Koren A. McCarroll S.A. Random replication of the inactive X chromosome.Genome Res. 2014; 24: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and more mutation-prone; late-replicating loci have elevated mutation rates in the human germline (Stamatoyannopoulos et al., 2009Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Adzhubei I. Thurman R.E. Kryukov G.V. Mirkin S.M. Sunyaev S.R. Human mutation rate associated with DNA replication timing.Nat.

Roberts S.A. et al.Mutational heterogeneity in cancer and the search for new cancer-associated genes.Nature. 2013; 499: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3708) Google Scholar). Structural mutations and chromosome fragility are also more common in late-replicating genomic regions (Koren et al., 2012Koren A. Polak P. Nemesh J. Michaelson J.J. Sebat J. Sunyaev S.R.

At the other extreme, chromosome fragility (and consequent mutations) are also increased at specific “early replicating fragile sites” (ERFSs), a subset of early replication origins at which interference between replication and transcription leads to double strand breaks (Barlow et al., 2013Barlow J.H.

These aspects of genome replication are conserved all the way to prokaryotes, in which genes close to the replication origin have increased expression relative to genes close to the terminus (Slager et al., 2014Slager J.

The organization of the bacterial genome.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2008; 42: 211-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and the rate of mutation gradually increases with distance from the origin (Sharp et al., 1989Sharp P.M. Shields D.C. Wolfe K.H. Li W.H. Chromosomal location and evolutionary rate variation in enterobacterial genes.Science. 1989; 246: 808-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), although close proximity to the origin can lead to structural alterations under conditions of replication stress (Slager et al., 2014Slager J.

A genome’s elaborate program of DNA replication is therefore strongly connected to genome function and evolution and could, in principle, be an object of variation and selection itself. However, it is not known whether DNA replication timing varies among members of the same species, nor whether such variation is under genetic control. Previous studies have concluded that replication timing is globally similar among individuals of the same species (Ryba et al., 2010Ryba T. Hiratani I. Lu J. Itoh M. Kulik M. Zhang J. Schulz T.C.

We hypothesized that this global similarity could still in principle coexist with interindividual variation at many individual loci and that such variation might be used to find genetic influences on replication timing. DNA replication results in dynamic changes in the copy number of each genomic locus; the earlier a locus replicates, the greater its average copy number in replicating (S phase) cells. To profile these differences across the genome, we have previously isolated G1 and S phase cells using FACS (Figure 1A), sequenced the DNA from both cell-cycle phases, and inferred replication timing from the long-range fluctuations in relative sequence abundance (the ratio of sequencing read depths from S- and G1-phase cells) along each chromosome (Figure 1B) (Koren et al., 2012Koren A. Polak P. Nemesh J. Michaelson J.J. Sebat J. Sunyaev S.R. McCarroll S.A. Differential relationship of DNA replication timing to different forms of human mutation and variation.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2012; 91: 1033-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To facilitate interpretation and comparison of replication profiles, we normalize replication timing to units of SDs (Z score units, with a genome-wide average of zero and SD of one). Replication profiles provide information regarding the time of replication of each locus in the genome. They also provide the estimated locations of replication origins, which are inferred from peaks along the replication profiles, where replication is earlier than the replication of flanking sequences (Raghuraman et al., 2001Raghuraman M.K. Winzeler E.A. Collingwood D. Hunt S. Wodicka L. Conway A. Lockhart D.J. Davis R.W. Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L.

In previous analyses of replication timing in lymphoblastoid cell lines from six individuals, we compared the individual-averaged profiles to patterns of mutations and variation in the human genome (Koren et al., 2012Koren A. Polak P. Nemesh J. Michaelson J.J. Sebat J. Sunyaev S.R. McCarroll S.A. Differential relationship of DNA replication timing to different forms of human mutation and variation.Am. J. Hum.

McCarroll S.A. Random replication of the inactive X chromosome.Genome Res. 2014; 24: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We sought in the current work to better ascertain and understand interindividual variation in DNA replication. The replication profiles of the six individuals closely matched one another across most of the genome (correlation coefficients r = 0.91–0.97 among all comparisons; Figures 1B and 1C), consistent with earlier findings that profiles from different individuals are broadly similar at genomic scales (Ryba et al., 2010Ryba T.

However, at scales of several hundred kilobases, we found that specific genomic loci exhibited clear differences in replication timing among the six individuals (Figure 1C). A systematic search for replication variation identified 221 replication-variant loci (Figures 1D–1I; Extended Experimental Procedures available online), each of which spanned 0.2–1.4 Mb (mean = 0.43 Mb). At most variant loci, individuals differed qualitatively in the usage of an origin (or origin cluster) (Figures 1C, 1D, 1F, and 1G), as inferred from the presence of a peak in the replication profile; or quantitatively in the average utilization or activation time of a replication origin (Figures 1H and 1I), as inferred from variations in the height of a peak. This analysis indicated substantial replication timing variation among humans but did not establish whether any aspect of this variation is under genetic control. Importantly, other factors could in principle influence the observed inter-individual variations in replication timing, including epigenetic influences or even the growth states of the cells at the time of DNA harvesting and the transformation of the cells with EBV. To identify those replication phenotypes that consistently associate with specific alleles, genetic mapping requires analysis of DNA replication timing in far more individuals. However, studies of replication timing to date have involved small numbers of samples. Whole genome sequencing is increasingly used to study DNA sequence variation in large numbers of humans; some studies, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, use DNA samples extracted from cultured, proliferating cells (1000 Genome Project Consortium, 20121000 Genome Project ConsortiumAn integrated map of genetic variation from 1,092 human genomes.Nature. 2012; 491: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (5686) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that active DNA replication might be visible in such data: the presence of S phase cells in such cultures could in principle cause long-range fluctuations in DNA copy number (measured by read depth) along each chromosome, with early replicating loci contributing more DNA than late-replicating loci. Array- and sequencing-based profiles of DNA copy number have long been known to contain megabase-scale “wave” patterns of copy number fluctuations that correlate with large-scale patterns of GC content along mammalian chromosomes (Marioni et al., 2007Marioni J.C.

However, although GC content influences the efficiency of PCR amplification, GC-wave effects are present at megabase rather than subkilobase (amplicon) scales. Notably, GC content and DNA replication timing are highly correlated at megabase scales (Rhind and Gilbert, 2013Rhind N. Gilbert D.M. DNA replication timing.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5: a010132Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and DNA copy number is typically measured in cell populations that are derived from asynchronous, proliferating cell cultures that contain many cells in S phase. In fact, a recent study (contemporaneous with this work) noted a visual resemblance and statistical correlation between a copy number profile (derived by array CGH) and DNA replication timing profiles (Manukjan et al., 2013Manukjan G. Tauscher M. Steinemann D. Replication timing influences DNA copy number determination by array-CGH.Biotechniques. 2013; 55: 231-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We designed a series of tests of the hypothesis that variation in sequencing coverage along chromosomes arises from true heterogeneity in DNA copy number due to ongoing DNA replication. We first tested this hypothesis using whole-genome sequence data from Phase I of the 1000 Genomes Project (1000 Genome Project Consortium, 20121000 Genome Project ConsortiumAn integrated map of genetic variation from 1,092 human genomes.Nature. 2012; 491: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (5686) Google Scholar), which sequenced DNA from nonsynchronized, proliferating LCL cultures. For each genome analyzed, we calculated read depth along each chromosome in sliding windows of 10 kb of uniquely alignable sequence, normalized for local GC content at amplicon (400 bp) scale (Handsaker et al., 2011Handsaker R.E. Korn J.M. Nemesh J. McCarroll S.A. Discovery and genotyping of genome structural polymorphism by sequencing on a population scale.Nat. Genet. 2011; 43: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) (Extended Experimental Procedures). Strikingly, in most LCL-derived genome sequences, fluctuations in read depth along each chromosome matched the LCL replication timing profiles that we had obtained by directly comparing G1 to S phase cells (Figures 2A and 2B ), suggesting that they reflect true differences in underlying DNA copy number arising from replicating cells. The presence of 5%–20% of S phase cells within a cell culture was sufficient in order to yield significant signals of DNA replication timing (Figure S1E; Extended Experimental Procedures).Figure S11000 Genomes Sample-Level Properties of Read Depth, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Correlations between properties of lymphoblastoid cell lines (Choy et al., 2008Choy E.

Blue shade represents the projected fraction of S phase cells in the 1000 Genomes samples used for studying replication timing variation. To further test the hypothesis that active DNA replication causes long-range fluctuations in read depth, we utilized the fact that a subset of the 1000 Genomes Project samples were derived from blood instead of LCLs. Because circulating blood cells have generally exited the cell cycle, these samples do not contain cells in S phase and should not exhibit signatures of DNA replication timing. Consistent with this hypothesis, read depth in blood-derived DNA samples lacked the strong autocorrelative patterns along chromosomes that we observed in LCL-derived DNA and was uncorrelated with profiles of replication timing (Figures 2A, 2B, and S1; Extended Experimental Procedures). In fact, we could distinguish blood-derived from LCL-derived DNA samples with 100% sensitivity and specificity, based solely on the relationship of their read depth profiles to our independent analyses of LCL replication timing (Figures 2A and S1; Table S1). Importantly, correlations between read depth and replication timing remained strong after controlling for GC content, whereas correlations between read depth and GC content (at scales >10 kb) were negligible after controlling for replication timing (Figures 2B and S1), suggesting that previously observed correlations of read depth with GC content (at 100 kb scales) are due to DNA replication timing. Furthermore, in a principal component analysis (Patterson et al., 2006Patterson N. Price A.L. Reich D. Population structure and eigenanalysis.PLoS Genet. 2006; 2: e190Crossref PubMed Scopus (3070) Google Scholar) of read depth along each of the LCL genomes, the strongest principal component, explaining 40% of the variance, corresponded to our estimate of the S phase replication content of each sample, and the chromosomal loadings of this component followed the replication timing profile (Figures 2C and 2D; Extended Experimental Procedures). The X chromosome provided an additional strong prediction of the hypothesis that read depth at a locus reflects the replication timing of that locus.

https://openalex.org/W1981473906,"Ribosomes elongate at a nonuniform rate during translation. Theoretical models and experiments disagree on the in vivo determinants of elongation rate and the mechanism by which elongation rate affects protein levels. To resolve this conflict, we measured transcriptome-wide ribosome occupancy under multiple conditions and used it to formulate a whole-cell model of translation in E. coli. Our model predicts that elongation rates at most codons during nutrient-rich growth are not limited by the intracellular concentrations of aminoacyl-tRNAs. However, elongation pausing during starvation for single amino acids is highly sensitive to the kinetics of tRNA aminoacylation. We further show that translation abortion upon pausing accounts for the observed ribosome occupancy along mRNAs during starvation. Abortion reduces global protein synthesis, but it enhances the translation of a subset of mRNAs. These results suggest a regulatory role for aminoacylation and abortion during stress, and our study provides an experimentally constrained framework for modeling translation."

Among these, the eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC (for TCP-1 ring complex, also called CCT for chaperonin containing TCP1) is distinguished by its complex architecture and mechanism, which allow it to fold a subset of essential and topologically complex proteins, including cell-cycle regulators, signaling proteins, and cytoskeletal components (Bigotti and Clarke, 2008Bigotti M.G.

TRiC/CCT is a large hetero-oligomeric ATP-dependent complex consisting of two eight-membered rings stacked back to back (Bigotti and Clarke, 2008Bigotti M.G. Clarke A.R.

Each ring creates a central chamber where substrate polypeptides bind and fold. Unlike simpler archaeal chaperonins, TRiC contains eight different paralogous subunits, named CCT1–CCT8, at fixed positions within each ring (Kalisman et al., 2012Kalisman N. Adams C.M. Levitt M.

All subunits are structural homologs that consist of an ATP-binding equatorial domain and a substrate-binding apical domain linked by an intermediate domain (Bigotti and Clarke, 2008Bigotti M.G.

Each subunit also contains an apical segment that forms a lid over the cavity. An ATP-driven conformational cycle links TRiC-mediated folding to opening and closure of the lid, encapsulating the substrate in the cavity (Cong et al., 2012Cong Y. Schröder G.F. Meyer A.S.

Adapting proteostasis for disease intervention.Science. 2008; 319: 916-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). TRiC interacts with approximately 10% of the proteome and is essential for viability (Yam et al., 2008Yam A.Y. Xia Y. Lin H.T. Burlingame A. Gerstein M. Frydman J.

In HIV, TRiC interacts with proteins Gag, Vif, and p6 (Hong et al., 2001Hong S. Choi G. Park S. Chung A.S. Hunter E. Rhee S.S.

The unique architecture and mechanistic features of TRiC set it apart from other chaperones. The diversification of subunits in TRiC is likely central to understand why many essential proteins, such as actin, Cdc20, and Cdh1, can only be folded with assistance from TRiC (Hartl et al., 2011Hartl F.U. Bracher A. Hayer-Hartl M. Molecular chaperones in protein folding and proteostasis.Nature. 2011; 475: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2190) Google Scholar, Spiess et al., 2004Spiess C. Meyer A.S.

Mechanism of the eukaryotic chaperonin: protein folding in the chamber of secrets.Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 598-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Despite their extensive conservation in the ATP-binding domains, TRiC subunits have widely divergent functions within the ATP-driven cycle (Reissmann et al., 2012Reissmann S. Joachimiak L.A. Chen B. Meyer A.S. Nguyen A. Frydman J. A gradient of ATP affinities generates an asymmetric power stroke driving the chaperonin TRIC/CCT folding cycle.Cell Rep. 2012; 2: 866-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Additionally, the surface properties of the different subunits result in an asymmetric distribution of electrostatic charges within the folding chamber (Leitner et al., 2012Leitner A. Joachimiak L.A. Bracher A. Mönkemeyer L. Walzthoeni T. Chen B. Pechmann S. Holmes S. Cong Y. Ma B. et al.The molecular architecture of the eukaryotic chaperonin TRiC/CCT.Structure. 2012; 20: 814-825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The principles driving TRiC substrate recognition are poorly understood. In vivo, TRiC folds a subset of cellular proteins, suggesting a degree of specificity; however, its substrates are functionally and structurally diverse, indicating the potential to bind a broad array of proteins. The apical domains of each TRiC subunit are thought to recognize different motifs in substrates (Spiess et al., 2004Spiess C. Meyer A.S. Reissmann S. Frydman J. Mechanism of the eukaryotic chaperonin: protein folding in the chamber of secrets.Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 598-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, Spiess et al., 2006Spiess C.

Cell. 2006; 24: 25-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) (Figures 1A and 1B). However, to date, no precise structural or sequence rules for TRiC-substrate binding have been identified. We here integrate biophysical and computational structural biology approaches with chemical crosslinking and mass spectrometry (XL-MS) to define the basis of TRiC-substrate recognition. We find that unique subunit-specific patterns of polar and hydrophobic residues underlie the distinct substrate binding properties of each subunit in the complex. The diversification of TRiC subunits thus provides a modular menu of binding specificities that allows for combinatorial recognition of substrate polypeptides. This likely contributes to TRiC’s unique ability to fold structurally diverse and topologically complex substrates. Evolutionary analyses further suggest that diversification of TRiC subunits from its simpler archaeal ancestors enabled the expansion of eukaryotic genomes to acquire proteins with novel folds and functions. To understand the molecular basis of this recognition specificity, we exploited substrates where the cognate CCT subunit and the relevant substrate motif have been identified (Figure 1C). The 54 amino acid-long HIV protein p6, and the related protein p4 from MPMV, associate directly with subunit CCT3 of TRiC (Hong et al., 2001Hong S. Choi G. Park S. Chung A.S. Hunter E. Rhee S.S. Type D retrovirus Gag polyprotein interacts with the cytosolic chaperonin TRiC.J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2526-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A short 6–9 amino acid-long hydrophobic motif in VHL, called Box1, contacts subunit CCT1 (Spiess et al., 2006Spiess C. Miller E.J. McClellan A.J. Frydman J.

Importantly, the isolated recombinant apical domains of each TRiC subunit retain the ability to bind substrates and substrate-derived motifs with the specificity of the same subunits within the intact complex (Spiess et al., 2006Spiess C.

We used purified HIV-p6 (herein p6) and VHL-Box1 (herein Box1) to examine the association of TRiC apical domains of CCT1 (herein ApiCCT1) and CCT3 (ApiCCT3) (Spiess et al., 2006Spiess C. Miller E.J.

A surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based assay measured association and dissociation kinetics for ApiCCT-substrate pairs (Figures 1E and 1F and Figure S1 available online). Binding kinetics of immobilized VHL-Box1 and HIV-p6 to their cognate and noncognate ApiCCT binding partners were monitored by SPR over a range of concentrations (Figures 1D–1F and S1A–S1D). Apparent association and dissociation rates (Figure 1E) and binding constants (Figure 1F) were calculated from the sensograms (Figure S1). These indicated that the ratio of association over dissociation rates, i.e., the overall affinity, was higher for the cognate ApiCCT-substrate pairs (Figure 1E), consistent with the specificity of these motifs for these subunits within the TRiC complex. The measured on-rates, determined at approximately 103 M−1 s−1, were markedly slower than diffusion-controlled binding (Figure 1E, blue bars) but consistent with the relatively slow substrate-binding kinetics of TRiC (Melki et al., 1997Melki R. Batelier G. Soulié S. Williams Jr., R.C. Cytoplasmic chaperonin containing TCP-1: structural and functional characterization.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5817-5826Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cognate interactions exhibited slower dissociation kinetics than noncognate interactions (Figures 1E and S1A–S1D). Both association and dissociation rates contribute to substrate specificity for different subunits. For p6, the difference between cognate and noncognate interaction was largely driven by dissociation rates, whereas for Box1, cognate and noncognate discrimination was a result of differential on- and off-rates (Figure 1E). Of note, even the cognate interactions are relatively weak, with an overall affinity of approximately 0.25–0.5 μM (Figure 1F). Accordingly, stable TRiC binding to most substrates will depend on multivalent recognition of several elements in the polypeptide by several subunits in the chaperonin. We focused on the ApiCCT3 and p6 interaction pair to gain a deeper structural understanding of TRiC-substrate recognition. NMR-based chemical shift (CS) mapping was used to identify the substrate-recognition interface in ApiCCT3 (Figures 2 and S2). The 15N-1H Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) spectrum of ApiCCT3 yielded well-resolved and dispersed spectra, accounting for 142 of 167 peaks, covering 85% of the protein sequence (Figures 2A and S2A and not shown). Standard triple-resonance backbone experiments, guided by specific amino acid labeling to anchor the sequence connectivities allowed us to successfully assign >85% of the peaks in the 2D HSQC spectrum, including all the ApiCCT3 residues perturbed upon substrate addition (Figures S2A–S2D). Titration of increasing amounts of unlabeled p6 into 15N-labeled ApiCCT3 produced concentration-dependent shifts in a specific subset of peaks (Figures 2A and 2B); five peaks were strongly perturbed (>0.2 ppm), and another four peaks were perturbed weakly (>0.1 ppm; Figure 2B). Similar experiments were performed with p6-related protein p4 from M-PMV, which binds CCT3 with lower affinity (Hong et al., 2001Hong S. Choi G. Park S. Chung A.S. Hunter E. Rhee S.S. Type D retrovirus Gag polyprotein interacts with the cytosolic chaperonin TRiC.J. Virol. 2001; 75: 2526-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar; data not shown). p4 addition affected the same residues in ApiCCT3 as p6 did (data not shown), albeit to a lower extent. In contrast, no perturbations were observed upon addition of Box1 (data not shown).Figure S2Specific Amino Acid Labeling and 19F Strategies Guide NMR Spectral Assignment of ApiCCT3, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Overlay of specific amino acid-labeled ApiCCT3 spectra onto a uniformly 15N labeled ApiCCT3 spectra (gray). 15N His, 15N Met, 15N Arg, 15N Lys, and 15N Gly are colored green, purple, cyan, blue, and red, respectively.(B) Schematic summarizing the assigned amino acid positions for the panel of 15N-specific amino acid-labeling schemes colored as in Figure S2A.(C and D) 15N specific amino acid labeled together with mutagenesis of individual residues were used to identify unambiguously histidine (C) and methionine (D) peaks, these positions were used as anchors in the backbone assignment process.

ApiCCT3 spectra shown from top to bottom: Y359F, Y303F, Y274F, Y247F, Y232F, and WT. Given that Y247 in ApiCCT3 (Figures 2A and 2B) was strongly perturbed upon substrate binding, we used 19F-NMR on 3F-tyrosine-labeled ApiCCT3 for an orthogonal assessment of the binding interface (Figures 2C and S2E). 1D 19F-NMR spectra of 3F-tyrosine-labeled ApiCCT3 revealed five discrete peaks, consistent with the five tyrosine residues in ApiCCT3 (Figure 2C). Systematic tyrosine-to-phenylalanine point mutations assigned each peak to unique tyrosine residues (Figure S2E). Upon addition of p6, one of the peaks exhibited a well-defined 0.2 ppm shift. In good agreement with our chemical-shift mapping, the perturbed peak corresponded to the 19F-tyrosine peak of Y247 (Figure 2C). Guided by NMR-CS information (Figure 2Di), we used CS-Rosetta and modeling to gain a structural understanding of ApiCCT3 in the substrate-bound conformation (Shen et al., 2009Shen Y. Vernon R. Baker D. Bax A. De novo protein structure generation from incomplete chemical shift assignments.J. Biomol. NMR. 2009; 43: 63-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) (see Experimental Procedures and Figures S4D and S4E).

https://openalex.org/W2086295808,"Glutamine is the primary metabolite of nitrogen assimilation from inorganic nitrogen sources in microorganisms and plants. The ability to monitor cellular nitrogen status is pivotal for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and sustaining growth. The present study identifies a glutamine-sensing mechanism common in the entire plant kingdom except Brassicaceae. The plastid-localized PII signaling protein controls, in a glutamine-dependent manner, the key enzyme of the ornithine synthesis pathway, N-acetyl-l-glutamate kinase (NAGK), that leads to arginine and polyamine formation. Crystal structures reveal that the plant-specific C-terminal extension of PII, which we term the Q loop, forms a low-affinity glutamine-binding site. Glutamine binding alters PII conformation, promoting interaction and activation of NAGK. The binding motif is highly conserved in plants except Brassicaceae. A functional Q loop restores glutamine sensing in a recombinant Arabidopsis thaliana PII protein, demonstrating the modular concept of the glutamine-sensing mechanism adopted by PII proteins during the evolution of plant chloroplasts."

Together, we provide the first transcriptome-wide map of Dicer targets and suggest conserved binding modes and functions outside of the miRNA pathway. Genes are subject to posttranscriptional regulation by small RNAs (sRNA) and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Over the past years, many regulatory sRNAs have been discovered (Bartel, 2009Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15858) Google Scholar, Kim et al., 2009Kim V.N. Han J. Siomi M.C. Biogenesis of small RNAs in animals.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 126-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2581) Google Scholar). Most miRNAs are generated from primary transcripts that undergo two distinct steps of processing. First, DROSHA and its partner DGCR8 release ∼70 nt stem-loop precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) inside of the nucleus (Lee et al., 2003Lee Y. Ahn C. Han J. Choi H. Kim J. Yim J. Lee J. Provost P. Rådmark O. Kim S. Kim V.N. The nuclear RNase III Drosha initiates microRNA processing.Nature. 2003; 425: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3970) Google Scholar). Alternatively, “mirtrons” are derived from introns in a splicing-machinery-dependent and Drosha-independent fashion (Okamura et al., 2007Okamura K. Hagen J.W. Duan H. Tyler D.M. Lai E.C. The mirtron pathway generates microRNA-class regulatory RNAs in Drosophila.Cell. 2007; 130: 89-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, Ruby et al., 2007Ruby J.G. Jan C.H. Bartel D.P. Intronic microRNA precursors that bypass Drosha processing.Nature. 2007; 448: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). The pre-miRNA hairpins are further cut by Dicer (Hutvágner et al., 2001Hutvágner G. McLachlan J. Pasquinelli A.E. Bálint E. Tuschl T. Zamore P.D. A cellular function for the RNA-interference enzyme Dicer in the maturation of the let-7 small temporal RNA.Science. 2001; 293: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar). The physical distance between the Dicer PAZ and 5′ pocket and the RNase III domains functions as a molecular “ruler” to control the product size (Lau et al., 2012Lau P.W. Guiley K.Z. De N. Potter C.S. Carragher B. MacRae I.J. The molecular architecture of human Dicer.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2012; 19: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, Park et al., 2011Park J.E. Heo I. Tian Y. Simanshu D.K. Chang H. Jee D. Patel D.J. Kim V.N. Dicer recognizes the 5′ end of RNA for efficient and accurate processing.Nature. 2011; 475: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The resulting ∼22 nt miRNA/miRNA∗ duplexes have a 2 nt overhang at the 3′ ends, which is a characteristic signature of Dicer processing (Bartel, 2009Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15858) Google Scholar). The duplexes are subsequently handed over to Argonaute (AGO) proteins, and one of the two strands is selected as the mature miRNA to form active RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which represses the expression of target genes (Bartel, 2009Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15858) Google Scholar). Dicer binding sites are typically indirectly inferred by mapping sRNA sequencing data to transcripts. Two adjacent read stacks suggest a pre-miRNA that was cleaved by Dicer. A more variable 3′ than 5′ end is also typical for miRNAs (Chiang et al., 2010Chiang H.R. Schoenfeld L.W. Ruby J.G. Auyeung V.C. Spies N. Baek D. Johnston W.K. Russ C. Luo S. Babiarz J.E. et al.Mammalian microRNAs: experimental evaluation of novel and previously annotated genes.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 992-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). By computationally scoring these and other hallmarks of Dicer processing, Dicer targets are inferred (Friedländer et al., 2012Friedländer M.R. Mackowiak S.D. Li N. Chen W. Rajewsky N. miRDeep2 accurately identifies known and hundreds of novel microRNA genes in seven animal clades.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 37-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). These methods invariably make assumptions about how Dicer binds and processes substrates. sRNA sequencing revealed diverse sRNA classes, including miRNAs that are processed from tRNAs and snoRNAs (Castellano and Stebbing, 2013Castellano L.

Currently, more than 1,800 pre-miRNAs in human and 200 in C. elegans are listed in miRBase (Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2014Kozomara A. Griffiths-Jones S. miRBase: annotating high confidence microRNAs using deep sequencing data.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: D68-D73Crossref PubMed Scopus (3811) Google Scholar). However, it remains challenging to distinguish miRNAs from fragments of other transcripts based on sRNA-sequencing data alone (Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2014Kozomara A. Griffiths-Jones S. miRBase: annotating high confidence microRNAs using deep sequencing data.Nucleic Acids Res. 2014; 42: D68-D73Crossref PubMed Scopus (3811) Google Scholar). There are also other types of sRNAs such as endogenous short interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) originating from long double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) generated by transposable elements or convergent transcription units (Kim et al., 2009Kim V.N. Han J. Siomi M.C. Biogenesis of small RNAs in animals.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 126-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2581) Google Scholar).

Ma E. Shigematsu H. Cianfrocco M.A. Noland C.L. Nagayama K. Nogales E. Doudna J.A. Wang H.W. Substrate-specific structural rearrangements of human Dicer.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 662-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) show that affinity and cleavage efficiency can be uncoupled properties of the bound substrate. In C. elegans, Dicer binds the lncRNA rncs-1 in vitro but does not process it to sRNA, leading to sequestration of Dicer and inhibition of its function (Hellwig and Bass, 2008Hellwig S. Bass B.L. A starvation-induced noncoding RNA modulates expression of Dicer-regulated genes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 12897-12902Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Other reports likewise point to functions of Dicer that are not connected to sRNA production. In human cells, Dicer is present in the nucleus (Doyle et al., 2013Doyle M. Badertscher L. Jaskiewicz L. Güttinger S. Jurado S. Hugenschmidt T. Kutay U. Filipowicz W.

Hugenschmidt T. Filipowicz W. Svoboda P. Dicer is associated with ribosomal DNA chromatin in mammalian cells.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e12175Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and interacts with nuclear pore complexes (Ando et al., 2011Ando Y. Tomaru Y. Morinaga A. Burroughs A.M. Kawaji H. Kubosaki A. Kimura R. Tagata M. Ino Y. Hirano H. et al.Nuclear pore complex protein mediated nuclear localization of dicer protein in human cells.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e23385Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In C. elegans, Dicer localizes to germline P granules and is required for their formation (Beshore et al., 2011Beshore E.L. McEwen T.J. Jud M.C. Marshall J.K. Schisa J.A. Bennett K.L. C. elegans Dicer interacts with the P-granule component GLH-1 and both regulate germline RNPs.Dev. Biol. 2011; 350: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Dicer is also present in chromatoid bodies of mammalian germ cells (Kotaja et al., 2006Kotaja N. Bhattacharyya S.N. Jaskiewicz L. Kimmins S. Parvinen M. Filipowicz W. Sassone-Corsi P. The chromatoid body of male germ cells: similarity with processing bodies and presence of Dicer and microRNA pathway components.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2006; 103: 2647-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). If Dicer binding and RNA cleavage are largely uncoupled, many interactions may be undetectable with current methods. Here, we present an in-depth identification and analysis of direct Dicer-binding sites in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and C. elegans by applying PAR-CLIP/iPAR-CLIP (Hafner et al., 2010Hafner M. Landthaler M. Burger L. Khorshid M. Hausser J. Berninger P. Rothballer A. Ascano Jr., M. Jungkamp A.C.

Cell. 2011; 44: 828-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) (Figure 1). Because mammals and nematodes both have a single full-length Dicer gene, assumed to process long dsRNAs and miRNAs, we were able to compare human and worm modes of Dicer targeting, highlighting core functions conserved during 550 million years of evolution. To measure the enzymatic activity of Dicer on its binding sites, we performed sRNA sequencing. In human cells, we deeply sequenced AGO-loaded sRNAs, enabling us to identify hundreds of additional miRNAs. We also identified in both human and worm thousands of stably bound Dicer target sites that were not processed into sRNAs (“passive” sites). In C. elegans, the top passively bound transcript was the lncRNA rncs-1, confirming previous in vitro data (Hellwig and Bass, 2008Hellwig S. Bass B.L. A starvation-induced noncoding RNA modulates expression of Dicer-regulated genes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 12897-12902Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and indicating that passive sites can function by sequestering Dicer. Dicer knockdown experiments in both human cells and worms suggest that passive sites, in contrast to sites that emit sRNAs, are generally stabilized by Dicer. Furthermore, we systematically compared passive Dicer targets across human and worm and discovered that messages encoding P body/granule components are statistically significantly enriched in both species. In summary, our data reveal hundreds of additional miRNAs, non-canonical substrates for dicing, and a novel, passive mode of Dicer binding. Moreover, we identify a large number of stably bound “passive” sites inside of many mRNAs in both human and worm. We present multiple lines of evidence that these sites are bound by Dicer nearby the loop of small hairpin structures within the intact host RNA, generally stabilizing its expression. We discuss several scenarios for the function of passive sites. To identify direct in vivo Dicer targets transcriptome wide, we performed PAR-CLIP (Hafner et al., 2010Hafner M. Landthaler M. Burger L. Khorshid M. Hausser J. Berninger P. Rothballer A. Ascano Jr., M. Jungkamp A.C. Munschauer M. et al.Transcriptome-wide identification of RNA-binding protein and microRNA target sites by PAR-CLIP.Cell. 2010; 141: 129-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar) in human HEK293 cells and iPAR-CLIP (Jungkamp et al., 2011Jungkamp A.C. Stoeckius M. Mecenas D. Grün D. Mastrobuoni G. Kempa S. Rajewsky N. In vivo and transcriptome-wide identification of RNA binding protein target sites.Mol. Cell. 2011; 44: 828-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) in young adult C. elegans worms (Figures 1B and 1C). We used HEK293 cells expressing FLAG/HA-tagged DICER1 protein (Figure S1A available online), whereas in C. elegans, we used a 3×FLAG/10×His-tagged DCR-1 rescue strain (Figure S1B). For HEK293 cells and worm, we combined three independent replicates each (see Figures S1C–S1F for reproducibility). After computational quality filtering, we identified ∼8,500 and ∼2,500 reproduced Dicer-binding sites in HEK293 cells and C. elegans, respectively. The crosslinking introduced specific nucleotide mutations and was not biased toward highly expressed genes (Figures S1G and S1H). We first investigated canonical miRNAs, exemplified by the human “oncomir” cluster miR-17–92 (Figure 2A) and the miR-35–41 cluster in C. elegans (Figure 2B). All PAR-CLIP experiments reproducibly mapped Dicer binding (Figure 2A and 2B). PAR-CLIP reads and crosslink-induced T-to-C mutations cover the entire pre-miRNA stem-loop structure. AGO-bound sRNA reads align to both sides of the stem and form precise double stacks, representing the “mature” and “star” miRNA. Additional ∼11 nt of base-paired RNA beyond the pre-miRNA reflect the requirements for Drosha processing (Han et al., 2006Han J. Lee Y. Yeom K.H. Nam J.W. Heo I. Rhee J.K. Sohn S.Y. Cho Y. Zhang B.T. Kim V.N. Molecular basis for the recognition of primary microRNAs by the Drosha-DGCR8 complex.Cell. 2006; 125: 887-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar) of miR-17 and miR-40 (Figures 2A and 2B, inserts). In contrast to sRNA sequencing, Dicer PAR-CLIP abundantly yielded reads spanning the loop region of miRNAs. This was further enhanced when the RNase T1 treatment was omitted (Figure S2A and S2B). Thus, our PAR-CLIP assay faithfully recovers Dicer binding to intact miRNA precursors. To our surprise, Dicer binds not only pre-miRNAs. We mapped Dicer-binding sites to GENCODE, WormBase in C. elegans, and miRBase annotations. Only 321 binding sites map to 316 individual miRNAs in HEK293 cells and 100 binding sites to 92 miRNAs in C. elegans. The majority of Dicer-binding sites map to a wide range of RNA transcripts, including not only other structural RNAs, such as tRNAs and snoRNAs, but also exonic and intronic mRNA regions (Figures 2C and 2D and Table S1). This is also reflected in the distribution of PAR-CLIP reads (Figures S2C and S2D). We asked how many of the expressed sRNAs map to Dicer-binding sites. We sequenced AGO-loaded sRNAs in HEK293 cells by immunoprecipitation of stably expressed FLAG/HA-tagged AGO2 and AGO3. The two data sets were highly correlated (Figure S2E) and subsequently merged (referred to as AGOIP). AGOIP read counts were also highly correlated to normal 5′-monophosphate-specific (5′-P) sRNA sequencing, indicating that the majority of expressed sRNAs are indeed loaded into AGO (Figure S2F). Of the aggregate number of AGOIP reads from 18–26 nt length, 95% originate from human Dicer-binding sites, comparable to the 93% explained by miRBase (Figure 2E). C. elegans expresses at least 27 Argonautes (Gu et al., 2009Gu W. Shirayama M. Conte Jr., D. Vasale J. Batista P.J. Claycomb J.M. Moresco J.J. Youngman E.M. Keys J.

Cell. 2009; 36: 231-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). We therefore relied on conventional sRNA sequencing. Here, 61% of 18–26 nt reads originate from nematode Dicer-binding sites, comparable to 60% explained by miRBase (Figure 2F). The previously published PAR-CLIP data sets of single-stranded RNA-binding proteins, human ELAVL1 (Lebedeva et al., 2011Lebedeva S. Jens M. Theil K. Schwanhäusser B. Selbach M. Landthaler M. Rajewsky N. Transcriptome-wide analysis of regulatory interactions of the RNA-binding protein HuR.Mol. Cell. 2011; 43: 340-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) and C.elegans GLD-1 (Jungkamp et al., 2011Jungkamp A.C. Stoeckius M. Mecenas D. Grün D. Mastrobuoni G.

Cell. 2011; 44: 828-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), were analyzed in the same manner as negative controls and explained less than 1% of the expressed sRNA. Worm-specific, triphosphorylated endo-siRNAs were sequenced independently and were found to be largely unassociated with Dicer-binding sites, consistent with previous results on their Dicer-independent production (Gu et al., 2009Gu W. Shirayama M. Conte Jr., D. Vasale J. Batista P.J. Claycomb J.M. Moresco J.J. Youngman E.M. Keys J. Stoltz M.J. et al.Distinct argonaute-mediated 22G-RNA pathways direct genome surveillance in the C. elegans germline.Mol. Cell. 2009; 36: 231-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) (Figure S2G). Because the pool of expressed sRNAs can be dominated by a few highly expressed miRNAs, we investigated the sensitivity of the Dicer PAR-CLIP as a function of sRNA expression. We considered all clusters of AGOIP reads that uniquely align to the genome as potential sites of sRNA production and selected those with a given minimal sRNA output. We then asked what fraction of these stacks overlap Dicer-binding sites, known miRNAs, or control sites (Figures 2G and 2H). Although Dicer-binding sites more often overlap with regions of low and intermediate sRNA expression than the miRBase annotation, the gap disappears for highly expressed sRNAs. Thus, although comparable fractions of total sRNA can be explained by either miRBase or Dicer binding, Dicer PAR-CLIP offers enhanced sensitivity for lowly expressed sRNAs. We conclude that Dicer PAR-CLIP identifies loci of sRNA production with high sensitivity and that the majority of AGO-loaded or 5′-P sRNAs (at least 95% in HEK cells and at least 61% in C. elegans) are probably Dicer products. Furthermore, the control data sets for ELAVL1 and GLD-1 demonstrate that our analysis of HEK293 and worm PAR-CLIP data has a very low rate (<1%) of falsely reporting sites that generate sRNAs. Next, we searched for previously unidentified miRNAs in the Dicer PAR-CLIP data. We identified 1,978 human DICER1-binding sites with AGOIP read counts above background level (Figure S3A). Of these, 1,678 are not listed in miRBase (Figure S3A). We ran miRDeep2 (Friedländer et al., 2012Friedländer M.R. Mackowiak S.D. Li N. Chen W. Rajewsky N. miRDeep2 accurately identifies known and hundreds of novel microRNA genes in seven animal clades.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 37-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar) to predict additional miRNAs from the AGOIP data independently and subsequently intersected these with DICER1-binding sites. This analysis resulted in 212 (not present in miRBase) miRNA candidates supported by Dicer PAR-CLIP (Table S2). However, we also found many Dicer-bound loci with a clean “double-stack” profile of AGOIP reads, the signature of processed pre-miRNAs, which were only called by miRDeep2 after deactivating the hairpin scoring (Table S2). This scoring is meant to assess how likely the hairpin fold of a sequence occurred by chance, which reduces false positives but also sensitivity. We successfully validated Dicer-dependent processing for three out of three such miRNAs by an in vitro processing assay (Figure S3B), demonstrating that the PAR-CLIP evidence for in vivo interactions allows us to relax the miRDeep2 filtering. In total, we report 367 new miRNA candidates predominantly originating from introns (like known miRNAs), but also from a variety of other sources including 5′ UTRs (Figures 3A and 3B ).Figure 3Identification and Validation of miRNA TargetsShow full caption(A) Annotation breakdown of identified (top) and known miRBase (bottom) miRNAs.(B) Examples of identified miRNAs of different human genomic origin.

In C. elegans, only two sites were identified as putative additional miRNAs (Figures S3C and S3D), which is not surprising considering the very deep sRNA profiling and smaller genome (Shi et al., 2013Shi Z.

High-throughput sequencing reveals extraordinary fluidity of miRNA, piRNA, and siRNA pathways in nematodes.Genome Res. 2013; 23: 497-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To validate the miRNA candidates, not present in miRBase, we compared sRNA read counts from control cells to Dicer- or Drosha-depleted cells (Figures S3E–S3G). Our 5′-P sequencing data allowed us to quantify expression changes of 52 miRNA candidates, which were specifically and highly significantly downregulated upon Dicer knockdown (Figures 3C, S3H, and S3I). Next, we screened publicly available AGO CLIP data for chimeric reads (Grosswendt et al., 2014Grosswendt S. Filipchyk A. Manzano M. Klironomos F. Schilling M. Herzog M. Gottwein E. Rajewsky N.

For 20 of our miRNA candidates, chimeric reads with target 3′ UTRs were found (Table S2). Although some indicate binding through seed complementarity, others show noncanonical miRNA:target interactions. For example, the miRNA derived from the 5′ UTR of glutamate-ammonia ligase (GLUL) appears to bind to the 3′ UTR of methyltransferase-like 8 (METTL8) by base-pairing within the central region of the miRNA (Figure 3E). We further validated four out of four candidates by northern analysis. Dicer dependence is reflected either by reduction of mature miRNA or by accumulation of pre-miRNA in Dicer-depleted"
https://openalex.org/W1986005605,"Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in glutamate-evoked neuronal excitotoxicity, and mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics are essential for mitochondrial morphology and function. Here, we establish a novel mechanistic linker among glutamate excitotoxicity, mitochondrial dynamics, and mitochondrial dysfunction in spinal cord motor neurons. Ca(2+)-dependent activation of the cysteine protease calpain in response to glutamate results in the degradation of a key mitochondrial outer membrane fusion regulator, mitofusin 2 (MFN2), and leads to MFN2-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation preceding glutamate-induced neuronal death. MFN2 deficiency impairs mitochondrial function, induces motor neuronal death, and renders motor neurons vulnerable to glutamate excitotoxicity. Conversely, MFN2 overexpression blocks glutamate-induced mitochondrial fragmentation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and/or neuronal death in spinal cord motor neurons both in vitro and in mice. The inhibition of calpain activation also alleviates glutamate-induced excitotoxicity of mitochondria and neurons. Overall, these results suggest that glutamate excitotoxicity causes mitochondrial dysfunction by impairing mitochondrial dynamics via calpain-mediated MFN2 degradation in motor neurons and thus present a molecular mechanism coupling glutamate excitotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction."

Shaping the Health of Adolescents in Zimbabwe (SHAZ!) was a randomized controlled trial of a combined intervention package including life-skills and health education, vocational training, micro-grants and social supports compared to life-skills and health education alone. SHAZ! was originally envisioned as a larger effectiveness trial, however, the intervention was scaled back due to contextual and economic conditions in the country at the time. SHAZ! enrolled 315 participants randomly assigned to study arm within blocks of 50 participants (158 intervention and 157 control). The intervention arm participants showed statistically significant differences from the control arm participants for several outcomes during the two years of follow up including; reduced food insecurity [IOR = 0.83 vs. COR = 0.68, p-0.02], and having their own income [IOR = 2.05 vs. COR = 1.67, p = 0.02]. Additionally, within the Intervention arm there was a lower risk of transactional sex [IOR = 0.64, 95% CI (0.50, 0.83)], and a higher likelihood of using a condom with their current partner [IOR = 1.79, 95% CI (1.23, 2.62)] over time compared to baseline. There was also evidence of fewer unintended pregnancies among intervention participants [HR = 0.61, 95% CI (0.37, 1.01)], although this relationship achieved only marginal statistical significance. Several important challenges in this study included the coordination with vocational training programs, the political and economic instability of the area at the time of the study, and the difficulty in creating a true standard of care control arm. Overall the results of the SHAZ! study suggest important potential for HIV prevention intervention packages that include vocational training and micro-grants, and lessons for further economic livelihoods interventions with adolescent females. Further work is needed to refine the intervention model, and test the impact of the intervention at scale on biological outcomes. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02034214"

The dynamics of phagocytes in left ventricular hypertrophy have not been systematically studied. Here, we characterized the temporal accumulation of leukocytes in the cardiac immune response by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy at day 3, 6 and 21 following transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Cardiac hypertrophy due to chronic pressure overload causes cardiac immune response and inflammation represented by an increase of immune cells at all three time points among which neutrophils reached their maximum at day 3 and macrophages at day 6. The cardiac macrophage population consisted of both Ly6Clow and Ly6Chigh macrophages. Ly6Clow macrophages were more abundant peaking at day 6 in response to pressure overload. During the development of cardiac hypertrophy the expression pattern of adhesion molecules was investigated by qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. CD11b, CX3CR1 and ICAM-1 determined by qRT-PCR in whole cardiac tissue were up-regulated in response to pressure overload at day 3 and 6. CD11b and CX3CR1 were significantly increased by TAC on the surface of Ly6Clow but not on Ly6Chigh macrophages. Furthermore, ICAM-1 was up-regulated on cardiac endothelial cells. In fluorescence microscopy Ly6Clow macrophages could be observed attached to the intra- and extra-vascular vessel-wall. Taken together, TAC induced the expression of adhesion molecules, which may explain the accumulation of Ly6Clow macrophages in the cardiac tissue, where these cells might contribute to cardiac inflammation and remodeling in response to pressure overload."

https://openalex.org/W2062159116,"ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) plays an essential role in mediating cholesterol efflux to apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), a major housekeeping mechanism for cellular cholesterol homeostasis. After initial engagement with ABCA1, apoA-I directly interacts with the plasma membrane to acquire cholesterol. This apoA-I lipidation process is also known to require cellular signaling processes, presumably to support cholesterol trafficking to the plasma membrane. We report here that one of major signaling pathways in mammalian cells, Akt, is also involved. In several cell models that express ABCA1 including macrophages, pancreatic beta cells and hepatocytes, inhibition of Akt increases cholesterol efflux to apoA-I. Importantly, Akt inhibition has little effect on cells expressing non-functional mutant of ABCA1, implicating a specific role of Akt in ABCA1 function. Furthermore, we provide evidence that mTORC1, a major downstream target of Akt, is also a negative regulator of cholesterol efflux. In cells where mTORC1 is constitutively activated due to tuberous sclerosis complex 2 deletion, cholesterol efflux to apoA-I is no longer sensitive to Akt activity. This suggests that Akt suppresses cholesterol efflux through mTORC1 activation. Indeed, inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin or Torin-1 promotes cholesterol efflux. On the other hand, autophagy, one of the major pathways of cholesterol trafficking, is increased upon Akt inhibition. Furthermore, Akt inhibition disrupts lipid rafts, which is known to promote cholesterol efflux to apoA-I. We therefore conclude that Akt, through its downstream targets, mTORC1 and hence autophagy, negatively regulates cholesterol efflux to apoA-I."
https://openalex.org/W2050802468,"Worldwide obesity rates are at epidemic levels, and new insight into the regulation of obesity and adipogenesis are required. Thy1 (CD90), a cell surface protein with an enigmatic function, is expressed on subsets of fibroblasts and stem cells. We used a diet-induced obesity model to show that Thy1-null mice gain weight at a faster rate and gain 30% more weight than control C57BL/6 mice. During adipogenesis, Thy1 expression is lost in mouse 3T3-L1 cells. Overexpression of Thy1 blocked adipocyte formation and reduced mRNA and protein expression of an adipocyte marker, fatty acid-binding protein 4, by 5-fold. Although preadipocyte fibroblasts expressed Thy1 mRNA and protein, adipocytes from mouse and human fat tissue had almost undetectable Thy1 levels. Thy1 decreases the activity of the adipogenic transcription factor PPARγ by more than 60% as shown by PPARγ-dependent reporter assays. Using both genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we show Thy1 expression dampens PPARγ by inhibiting the activity of the Src-family kinase, Fyn. Thus, these studies reveal Thy1 blocks adipogenesis and PPARγ by inhibiting Fyn and support the idea that Thy1 is a novel therapeutic target in obesity.—Woeller, C. F., O'Loughlin, C. W., Pollock, S.

https://openalex.org/W1978039503,"Proteins are frequently modified by post-translational methylation of lysine residues, catalyzed by S-adenosylmethionine-dependent lysine methyltransferases (KMTs). Lysine methylation of histone proteins has been extensively studied, but it has recently become evident that methylation of non-histone proteins is also abundant and important. The human methyltransferase METTL20 belongs to a group of 10 established and putative human KMTs. We here found METTL20 to be associated with mitochondria and determined that recombinant METTL20 methylated a single protein in extracts from human cells. Using an methyltransferase activity-based purification scheme, we identified the β-subunit of the mitochondrially localized electron transfer flavoprotein (ETFβ) as the substrate of METTL20. Furthermore, METTL20 was found to specifically methylate two adjacent lysine residues, Lys(200) and Lys(203), in ETFβ both in vitro and in cells. Interestingly, the residues methylated by METTL20 partially overlap with the so-called recognition loop in ETFβ, which has been shown to mediate its interaction with various dehydrogenases. Accordingly, we found that METTL20-mediated methylation of ETFβ in vitro reduced its ability to receive electrons from the medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and the glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase. In conclusion, the present study establishes METTL20 as the first human KMT localized to mitochondria and suggests that it may regulate cellular metabolism through modulating the interaction between its substrate ETFβ and dehydrogenases. Based on the previous naming of similar enzymes, we suggest the renaming of human METTL20 to ETFβ-KMT."
https://openalex.org/W2148279399,"Cdc42 is a highly conserved master regulator of cell polarity. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which yeast cells never re-establish polarity at cortical sites (cytokinesis remnants [CRMs]) that have previously supported Cdc42-mediated growth as a paradigm to mechanistically understand how Cdc42-inhibitory polarity cues are established. We revealed a two-step mechanism of loading the Cdc42 antagonist Nba1 into CRMs to mark these compartments as refractory for a second round of Cdc42 activation. Our data indicate that Nba1 together with a cortically tethered adaptor protein confers memory of previous polarization events to translate this spatial legacy into a biochemical signal that ensures the local singularity of Cdc42 activation. “Memory loss” mutants that repeatedly use the same polarity site over multiple generations display nuclear segregation defects and a shorter lifespan. Our work thus established CRMs as negative polarity cues that prevent Cdc42 reactivation to sustain the fitness of replicating cells."
https://openalex.org/W1964715823,"Glycogen is a branched polymer of glucose that acts as an energy reserve in many cell types. Glycogen contains trace amounts of covalent phosphate, in the range of 1 phosphate per 500–2000 glucose residues depending on the source. The function, if any, is unknown, but in at least one genetic disease, the progressive myoclonic epilepsy Lafora disease, excessive phosphorylation of glycogen has been implicated in the pathology by disturbing glycogen structure. Some 90% of Lafora cases are attributed to mutations of the EPM2A or EPM2B genes, and mice with either gene disrupted accumulate hyperphosphorylated glycogen. It is, therefore, of importance to understand the chemistry of glycogen phosphorylation. Rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen contained covalent phosphate as monoesters of C2, C3, and C6 carbons of glucose residues based on analyses of phospho-oligosaccharides by NMR. Furthermore, using a sensitive assay for glucose 6-P in hydrolysates of glycogen coupled with measurement of total phosphate, we determined the proportion of C6 phosphorylation in rabbit muscle glycogen to be ∼20%. C6 phosphorylation also accounted for ∼20% of the covalent phosphate in wild type mouse muscle glycogen. Glycogen phosphorylation in Epm2a−/− and Epm2b−/− mice was increased 8- and 4-fold compared with wild type mice, but the proportion of C6 phosphorylation remained unchanged at ∼20%. Therefore, our results suggest that C2, C3, and/or C6 phosphate could all contribute to abnormal glycogen structure or to Lafora disease.Lafora disease is characterized by abnormal, hyperphosphorylated glycogen.Results20% of the total phosphate is present as a C6 phosphomonoester of glucose residues; this proportion is unchanged in glycogen from mouse models of Lafora disease.ConclusionC6 phosphate is not the dominant phosphomonoester.SignificanceC2, C3, or C6 phosphate could all contribute to aberrant glycogen structure.

Glycogen contains trace amounts of covalent phosphate, in the range of 1 phosphate per 500–2000 glucose residues depending on the source. The function, if any, is unknown, but in at least one genetic disease, the progressive myoclonic epilepsy Lafora disease, excessive phosphorylation of glycogen has been implicated in the pathology by disturbing glycogen structure. Some 90% of Lafora cases are attributed to mutations of the EPM2A or EPM2B genes, and mice with either gene disrupted accumulate hyperphosphorylated glycogen. It is, therefore, of importance to understand the chemistry of glycogen phosphorylation. Rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen contained covalent phosphate as monoesters of C2, C3, and C6 carbons of glucose residues based on analyses of phospho-oligosaccharides by NMR. Furthermore, using a sensitive assay for glucose 6-P in hydrolysates of glycogen coupled with measurement of total phosphate, we determined the proportion of C6 phosphorylation in rabbit muscle glycogen to be ∼20%. C6 phosphorylation also accounted for ∼20% of the covalent phosphate in wild type mouse muscle glycogen. Glycogen phosphorylation in Epm2a−/− and Epm2b−/− mice was increased 8- and 4-fold compared with wild type mice, but the proportion of C6 phosphorylation remained unchanged at ∼20%. Therefore, our results suggest that C2, C3, and/or C6 phosphate could all contribute to abnormal glycogen structure or to Lafora disease.Lafora disease is characterized by abnormal, hyperphosphorylated glycogen. 20% of the total phosphate is present as a C6 phosphomonoester of glucose residues; this proportion is unchanged in glycogen from mouse models of Lafora disease.

Most pure recombinant prion protein (PrP) amyloids generated in vitro are not infectious and lack the extent of the protease-resistant core and solvent exclusion of infectious PrPSc, especially within residues ∼90–160. Polyanionic cofactors can enhance infectivity and PrPSc-like characteristics of such fibrils, but the mechanism of this enhancement is unknown. In considering structural models of PrPSc multimers, we identified an obstacle to tight packing that might be overcome with polyanionic cofactors, namely, electrostatic repulsion between four closely spaced cationic lysines within a central lysine cluster of residues 101–110. For example, in our parallel in-register intermolecular β-sheet model of PrPSc, not only would these lysines be clustered within the 101–110 region of the primary sequence, but they would have intermolecular spacings of only ∼4.8 Å between stacked β-strands.

https://openalex.org/W1996777945,"Staphylococcus aureus is a major component of the skin microbiota and causes a large number of serious infections. S. aureus first interacts with epidermal keratinocytes to breach the epidermal barrier through mechanisms not fully understood. By use of primary keratinocytes from mice with epidermis-restricted Ilk gene inactivation and control integrin-linked kinase (ILK)-expressing littermates, we investigated the role of ILK in epidermal S. aureus invasion. Heat-killed, but not live, bacteria were internalized to Rab5- and Rab7-positive phagosomes, and incubation with keratinocyte growth factor increased their uptake 2.5-fold. ILK-deficient mouse keratinocytes internalized bacteria 2- to 4-fold less efficiently than normal cells. The reduced invasion by live S. aureus of ILK-deficient cells was restored in the presence of exogenous, constitutively active Rac1. Thus, Rac1 functions downstream from ILK during invasion. Further, invasion by S. aureus of Rac1-deficient cells was 2.5-fold lower than in normal cells. Paradoxically, staphylococcal cutaneous penetration of mouse skin explants with ILK-deficient epidermis was 35-fold higher than that of normal skin, indicating defects in epidermal barrier function in the absence of ILK. Thus, we identified an ILK-Rac1 pathway essential for bacterial invasion of keratinocytes, and established ILK as a key contributor to prevent invasive staphylococcal cutaneous infection."
https://openalex.org/W2133059767,"Background Glucoamylase is an exo-type enzyme that converts starch completely into glucose from the non-reducing ends. To meet the industrial requirements for starch processing, a glucoamylase with excellent thermostability, raw-starch degradation ability and high glucose yield is much needed. In the present study we selected the excellent Carbohydrate-Activity Enzyme (CAZyme) producer, Bispora sp. MEY-1, as the microbial source for glucoamylase gene exploitation. Methodology/Principal Findings A glucoamylase gene (gla15) was cloned from Bispora sp. MEY-1 and successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris with a high yield of 34.1 U/ml. Deduced GLA15 exhibits the highest identity of 64.2% to the glucoamylase from Talaromyces (Rasamsonia) emersonii. Purified recombinant GLA15 was thermophilic and showed the maximum activity at 70°C. The enzyme was stable over a broad pH range (2.2–11.0) and at high temperature up to 70°C. It hydrolyzed the breakages of both α-1,4- and α-1,6-glycosidic linkages in amylopectin, soluble starch, amylose, and maltooligosaccharides, and had capacity to degrade raw starch. TLC and H1-NMR analysis showed that GLA15 is a typical glucoamylase of GH family 15 that releases glucose units from the non-reducing ends of α-glucans. The combination of Bacillus licheniformis amylase and GLA15 hydrolyzed 96.14% of gelatinized maize starch after 6 h incubation, which was about 9% higher than that of the combination with a commercial glucoamylase from Aspergillus niger. Conclusion/Significance GLA15 has a broad pH stability range, high-temperature thermostability, high starch hydrolysis capacity and high expression yield. In comparison with the commercial glucoamylase from A. niger, GLA15 represents a better candidate for application in the food industry including production of glucose, glucose syrups, and high-fructose corn syrups."

However, the role of the three isoforms of the main Ca2+-extruding system, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), in NGF-induced differentiation remains unexplored. We investigated whether NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3 isoforms could play a relevant role in neuronal differentiation through the modulation of [Ca2+]i and the Akt pathway. NGF caused progressive neurite elongation; a significant increase of the well known marker of growth cones, GAP-43; and an enhancement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ content and of Akt phosphorylation through an early activation of ERK1/2. Interestingly, during NGF-induced differentiation, the NCX1 protein level increased, NCX3 decreased, and NCX2 remained unaffected. At the same time, NCX total activity increased. Moreover, NCX1 colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with GAP-43, and NCX1 silencing prevented NGF-induced effects on GAP-43 expression, Akt phosphorylation, and neurite outgrowth.

https://openalex.org/W2000799339,"Paraquat concentration-time data have been used to predict the clinical outcome following ingestion. However, these studies have included only small populations, although paraquat poisoning has a very high mortality rate. The purpose of this study was to develop a simple and reliable model to predict survival according to the time interval post-ingestion in patients with acute paraquat poisoning. Data were retrospectively collected for patients who were admitted with paraquat poisoning to Soonchunhyang University Choenan Hospital between January 2005 and December 2012. Plasma paraquat levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. To validate the model we developed, we used external data from 788 subjects admitted to the Presbyterian Medical Center, Jeonju, Korea, between January 2007 and December 2012. Two thousand one hundred thirty six patients were included in this study. The overall survival rate was 44% (939/2136). The probability of survival for any specified time and concentration could be predicted as (exp(logit))/(1+exp(logit)), where logit = 1.3544+[−3.4688×log10(plasma paraquat μg/M)]+[−2.3169×log10(hours since ingestion)]. The external validation study showed that our model was highly accurate for the prediction of survival (C statics 0.964; 95% CI [0.952–0.975]). We have developed a model that is effective for predicting survival after paraquat intoxication."

However, the effectiveness and efficacy of PSM in clinical practice and whether outcomes are different for females and males has been sparsely investigated.The objective is to evaluate the sex-dependent effectiveness of PSM of oral anticoagulant therapy in everyday clinical practice. Methods All patients performing PSM affiliated to Aarhus University Hospital and Aalborg University Hospital, Denmark in the period 1996–2012 were included in a case-series study. The effectiveness was estimated using the following parameters: stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeding, intracranial bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, death and time spent in the therapeutic international normalized ratio (INR) target range. Prospectively registered patient data were obtained from two databases in the two hospitals. Cross-linkage between the databases and national registries provided detailed information on the incidence of death, bleeding and thromboembolism on an individual level. Results A total of 2068 patients were included, representing 6,900 patient-years in total. Males achieved a significantly better therapeutic INR control than females; females spent 71.1% of the time within therapeutic INR target range, whereas males spent 76.4% (p<0.0001). Importantly, death, bleeding and thromboembolism were not significantly different between females and males. Conclusions Among patients treated with self-managed oral anticoagulant therapy, males achieve a higher effectiveness than females in terms of time spent in therapeutic INR range, but the incidence of major complications is low and similar in both sexes."
https://openalex.org/W1972351383,"Chromatin dependent activation and repression of transcription is regulated by the histone modifying enzymatic activities of the trithorax (trxG) and Polycomb (PcG) proteins. To investigate the mechanisms underlying their mutual antagonistic activities we analyzed the function of Drosophila dRYBP, a conserved PcG- and trxG-associated protein. We show that dRYBP is itself ubiquitylated and binds ubiquitylated proteins. Additionally we show that dRYBP maintains H2A monoubiquitylation, H3K4 monomethylation and H3K36 dimethylation levels and does not affect H3K27 trimethylation levels. Further we show that dRYBP interacts with the repressive SCE and dKDM2 proteins as well as the activating dBRE1 protein. Analysis of homeotic phenotypes and post-translationally modified histones levels show that dRYBP antagonizes dKDM2 and dBRE1 functions by respectively preventing H3K36me2 demethylation and H2B monoubiquitylation. Interestingly, our results show that inactivation of dBRE1 produces trithorax-like related homeotic transformations, suggesting that dBRE1 functions in the regulation of homeotic genes expression. Our findings indicate that dRYBP regulates morphogenesis by counteracting transcriptional repression and activation. Thus, they suggest that dRYBP may participate in the epigenetic plasticity important during normal and pathological development."

The mechanisms underlying these improvements have so far not been elucidated fully. To further investigate the mechanisms of a VLCD with or without exercise and to uncover possible biomarkers associated with these interventions, blood samples were collected from 27 obese type 2 diabetes patients before and after a 16-week VLCD (Modifast ∼450 kcal/day). Thirteen of these patients followed an exercise program in addition to the VCLD. Plasma was obtained from 27 lean and 27 obese controls as well. Proteomic analysis was performed using mass spectrometry (MS) and targeted multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) and a large scale isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) approach. After the 16-week VLCD, there was a significant decrease in body weight and HbA1c in all patients, without differences between the two intervention groups. Targeted MRM analysis revealed differences in several proteins, which could be divided in diabetes-associated (fibrinogen, transthyretin), obesity-associated (complement C3), and diet-associated markers (apolipoproteins, especially apolipoprotein A-IV). To further investigate the effects of exercise, large scale iTRAQ analysis was performed. However, no proteins were found showing an exercise effect. Thus, in this study, specific proteins were found to be differentially expressed in type 2 diabetes patients versus controls and before and after a VLCD. These proteins are potential disease state and intervention specific biomarkers. Trial Registration Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN76920690"

Methods We performed qualitative interviews (n = 5) and a survey (n = 104) with MS patients regarding MRI patient information, and basic MRI knowledge. Based on these findings an interactive training program of 2 hours was developed and piloted in n = 26 patients. Results Interview analyses showed that patients often feel lost in the MRI scanner and left alone with MRI results and images while 90% of patients in the survey expressed a high interest in MRI education. Knowledge on MRI issues was fair with some important knowledge gaps. Major information interests were relevance of lesions as well as the prognostic and diagnostic value of MRI results. The education program was highly appreciated and resulted in a substantial knowledge increase. Patients reported that, based on the program, they felt more competent to engage in encounters with their physicians.

https://openalex.org/W2140354457,"Objectives One of the most referenced theoretical frameworks to measure Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) is the Wilson and Cleary framework. With some adaptions this framework has been validated in the adult population, but has not been tested in pediatric populations. Our goal was to empirically investigate it in children. Methods The contributory factors to Health Related Quality of Life that we included were symptom status (presence of chronic disease or hospitalizations), functional status (developmental status), developmental aspects of the individual (social-emotional) behavior, and characteristics of the social environment (socioeconomic status and area of education). Structural equation modeling was used to assess the measurement structure of the model in 214 German children (3–5 years old) participating in a follow-up study that investigates pediatric health outcomes. Results Model fit was χ2 = 5.5; df = 6; p = 0.48; SRMR = 0.01. The variance explained of Health Related Quality of Life was 15%. Health Related Quality of Life was affected by the area education (i.e. where kindergartens were located) and development status. Developmental status was affected by the area of education, socioeconomic status and individual behavior. Symptoms did not affect the model. Conclusions The goodness of fit and the overall variance explained were good. However, the results between children' and adults' tests differed and denote a conceptual gap between adult and children measures. Indeed, there is a lot of variety in pediatric Health Related Quality of Life measures, which represents a lack of a common definition of pediatric Health Related Quality of Life. We recommend that researchers invest time in the development of pediatric Health Related Quality of Life theory and theory based evaluations."

Open table in a new tab MSM, men who have sex with men; Ad5, adenovirus serotype 5. A rAd5 vector-based vaccine expressing the HIV-1 internal proteins gag/pol/nef was then tested in the Step (HVTN 502) and Phambili (HVTN 503) phase IIb trials. The Step trial, which was conducted in MSM and high-risk women in the Americas, Caribbean, and Australia, was stopped for futility to block HIV-1 acquisition (Buchbinder et al., 2008Buchbinder S.P. Mehrotra D.V. Duerr A. Fitzgerald D.W. Mogg R. Li D. Gilbert P.B. Lama J.R. Marmor M. Del Rio C. et al.Step Study Protocol TeamLancet. 2008; 372: 1881-1893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). Subsequent analyses suggested an increase in HIV-1 acquisition in vaccinees, particularly in the subgroup of uncircumcised men who were seropositive at baseline for Ad5. This finding cast a pall over the HIV-1 vaccine development field and led to increased research emphasis on the potential importance of vector-specific immune responses. The Phambili study tested the same vaccine in high-risk heterosexuals in South Africa and was stopped during its enrollment phase shortly after the Step results were announced (Gray et al., 2011Gray G.E. Allen M. Moodie Z. Churchyard G. Bekker L.G. Nchabeleng M. Mlisana K. Metch B. de Bruyn G. Latka M.H. et al.HVTN 503/Phambili study teamLancet Infect. Dis. 2011; 11: 507-515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Unblinded follow-up of Phambili participants suggested a very late effect of excess HIV-1 infections in heterosexual male vaccinees without a clear mechanism of action (Gray et al., 2014Gray G.E.

Dis. 2014; 14: 388-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Concordant with the lack of efficacy observed in these clinical trials, preclinical studies similarly demonstrated that analogous rAd5 vectors expressing gag/pol/nef from the related simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) afforded no protection against acquisition of infection following mucosal SIV challenges in rhesus monkeys (Reynolds et al., 2012Reynolds M.R. Weiler A.M. Piaskowski S.M. Piatak Jr., M. Robertson H.T. Allison D.B. Bett A.J. Casimiro D.R. Shiver J.W. Wilson N.A. et al.Vaccine. 2012; 30: 4465-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The third vaccine concept involved priming with a canarypox vector (ALVAC) expressing the HIV-1 antigens gag/pol/env and boosting with the same gp120 protein subunits that were used in the Vax003 study. The RV144 study was conducted in a low-incidence, mostly heterosexual population in Thailand and demonstrated vaccine efficacy of 31% at 42 months (Rerks-Ngarm et al., 2009Rerks-Ngarm S. Pitisuttithum P. Nitayaphan S. Kaewkungwal J. Chiu J. Paris R. Premsri N. Namwat C. de Souza M. Adams E. et al.MOPH-TAVEG InvestigatorsN. Engl. J. Med. 2009; 361: 2209-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2448) Google Scholar). Efficacy was 60% at 12 months, indicative of an early protective effect that waned over time. Subsequent analyses demonstrated that the risk of HIV-1 infection correlated inversely with antibodies directed against the first and second HIV-1 Env variable regions (V1V2) and correlated directly with Env-specific IgA antibodies (Haynes et al., 2012Haynes B.F. Gilbert P.B. McElrath M.J. Zolla-Pazner S. Tomaras G.D. Alam S.M. Evans D.T. Montefiori D.C. Karnasuta C. Sutthent R. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2012; 366: 1275-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Additional analyses suggested that HIV-1 infection risk also inversely correlated most clearly with V2-specific antibodies of the IgG3 isotype and non-neutralizing functional activity. Furthermore, a molecular sieve analysis showed immune selection pressure on specific V2 amino acids in vaccinees (Rolland et al., 2012Rolland M. Edlefsen P.T. Larsen B.B. Tovanabutra S. Sanders-Buell E. Hertz T. deCamp A.C. Carrico C. Menis S. Magaret C.A. et al.Nature. 2012; 490: 417-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Consistent with the clinical results, modest protective efficacy was also observed with analogous ALVAC/gp120 vaccines against mucosal SIV challenges in rhesus monkeys. The fourth vaccine concept that was tested involved priming with DNA vaccines expressing gag/pol/nef/env and boosting with rAd5 vectors expressing gag/pol/env in the HVTN 505 study, which was a phase IIb study conducted in MSM in the Americas. Importantly, preclinical data showed that this vaccine afforded partial protection against low-stringency SIV challenges (strain SIVsmE660) in rhesus monkeys but failed to protect against high-stringency SIV challenges (strain SIVmac251) (Letvin et al., 2011Letvin N.L. Rao S.S. Montefiori D.C. Seaman M.S. Sun Y. Lim S.Y. Yeh W.W. Asmal M. Gelman R.S. Shen L. et al.Sci. Transl. Med. 2011; 3: 81ra36Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). HVTN 505 was halted at its first interim efficacy analysis for futility to protect against HIV-1 acquisition or lower HIV-1 viral RNA in breakthrough infections (Hammer et al., 2013Hammer S.M. Sobieszczyk M.E. Janes H. Karuna S.T. Mulligan M.J. Grove D. Koblin B.A. Buchbinder S.P. Keefer M.C. Tomaras G.D. et al.HVTN 505 Study TeamN. Engl. J. Med. 2013; 369: 2083-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest that preclinical studies of HIV-1 vaccines should be evaluated exclusively in stringent preclinical challenge models. Several HIV-1 vaccine candidates are expected to be evaluated in clinical efficacy studies in the next few years. The Poxvirus-Protein Public Private Partnership (“P5”) is a collaborative group that has been formed to build on the results of the RV144 trial and to test the identified V2 correlate of risk in a new series of HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trials in sub-Saharan Africa and Thailand. For studies in Africa, new ALVAC and gp120 vaccine products with HIV-1 clade C antigens are currently being manufactured. ALVAC vectors expressing clade C antigens and MF59-adjuvanted gp120 subunits are planned for a phase III licensure study in sub-Saharan Africa. Other strategies, including NYVAC and DNA-NYVAC priming prior to gp120 boosting, are planned for evaluation in non-licensure track phase IIb efficacy studies. High-risk MSM cohorts are also being explored in Thailand for further efficacy testing. Additional HIV-1 vaccine candidates are also being developed for efficacy testing. A recombinant adenovirus serotype 26 (rAd26) prime expressing gag/pol/env with a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) boost expressing the same antigens has shown substantial protection against both SIVmac251 and SHIV-SF162P3 challenges in rhesus monkeys (Barouch et al., 2012Barouch D.H. Liu J. Li H. Maxfield L.F. Abbink P. Lynch D.M. Iampietro M.J. SanMiguel A. Seaman M.S. Ferrari G. et al.Nature. 2012; 482: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, Barouch et al., 2013Barouch D.H. Stephenson K.E. Borducchi E.N. Smith K. Stanley K. McNally A.G. Liu J. Abbink P. Maxfield L.F. Seaman M.S. et al.Cell. 2013; 155: 531-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Boosting with an Env gp140 trimer appears to improve this observed protective efficacy in monkeys (D.H.B., unpublished data). A prototype rAd26 vector expressing env was also recently shown to be safe and immunogenic in humans with no evidence for activation of total or vector-specific CD4+ T cells in colorectal mucosa (Baden et al., 2014Baden L.R. Liu J. Li H. Johnson J.A. Walsh S.R. Kleinjan J.A. Engelson B.A. Peter L. Abbink P. Milner Jr., D.A. et al.J. Infect. Dis. 2014; (Published online August 26, 2014)https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiu485Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A multivalent Ad26/MVA vaccine expressing HIV-1 “mosaic” gag/pol/env immunogens designed for optimal coverage of global virus diversity, together with a stable Env gp140 trimer, are expected to enter clinical trials later this year. These Ad26/MVA and Ad26/gp140 vaccines are currently under consideration for advancement into efficacy testing. Other promising vaccine candidates that have entered early phase clinical trials include priming with DNA vaccines and boosting with MVA vectors. In addition, early phase clinical trials are planned with cytomegalovirus (CMV) vectors, which showed substantial virologic control and possible clearance of SIVmac251 in approximately half of vaccinated monkeys following challenge (Hansen et al., 2013Hansen S.G. Piatak Jr., M. Ventura A.B. Hughes C.M. Gilbride R.M. Ford J.C. Oswald K. Shoemaker R. Li Y. Lewis M.S. et al.Nature. 2013; 502: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Why have so few HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trials been conducted to date for a problem of such global importance? Factors include the enormous scientific challenges in designing a vaccine for a highly variable virus that integrates in the host genome, rapidly establishes latency, and effectively evades both humoral and cellular immune responses. Although certain correlates of risk were identified in the RV144 study, it is currently not clear whether these are true mechanistic correlates of protection or whether they will prove generalizable beyond the RV144 study. In addition, although nonhuman primate challenge models have proven informative, they do not yet represent validated animal models that are necessarily predictive of clinical efficacy trials. As a result, large, complex, iterative clinical efficacy studies are required to show the efficacy of candidate HIV-1 vaccines in humans. Moreover, the primary endpoint of such studies has to be incident new HIV-1 infections in large populations of high risk individuals. Such studies are expensive and logistically challenging, and thus they pose substantial risk to the pharmaceutical industry that traditionally drives advanced clinical development of vaccines. Accelerating efficacy testing of novel and promising HIV-1 vaccine candidates will be vital for the field. In the absence of a validated and generalizable immune correlate of protection, only carefully designed clinical efficacy trials can determine whether a HIV-1 vaccine works in humans. The results of such trials, regardless of their outcomes, will have major impacts on the HIV-1 vaccine field, and they will lead to immediate prioritization and deprioritization of vaccine candidates and strategies. Studies that show partial protective efficacy will also refine our understanding of immune correlates of protection. The efficacy trials conducted to date have had surprising outcomes that have been discordant with the expectations of experts in the field, and thus the current state of knowledge is inadequate to predict the results of any such efficacy trials with certainty. To accelerate efficacy testing of next-generation HIV-1 vaccine candidates, increased industry involvement, mobilization of resources, expansion of the current vaccine pipeline, and robust preclinical challenge studies will likely prove critical. Increased industry involvement would be highly desirable for the HIV-1 vaccine field, particularly for advanced clinical development. Industry provides unique expertise in terms of manufacturing, regulatory affairs, and product development, as well as downstream licensure capacity to produce and to deliver a vaccine in the event that efficacy trials are successful. Currently, industry involvement has been relatively modest for the reasons described previously. Both the NIH and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have programs that actively support academic-industry partnerships, and these programs should be continued and expanded. Engaging and encouraging industry involvement at the earliest stages in vaccine development may interest a potential industry partner in a particular vaccine platform and may lead to increased involvement for advanced clinical development should the scientific rationale prove compelling. Early involvement of industry may also be critical, as companies may need the use of particular raw materials, cell lines, vectors, or manufacturing technologies to be consistent with their internal platforms or processes. The size, cost, and logistic complexity of HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trials are substantial. Thus, in addition to the major current investments from the NIH, Gates Foundation, and multiple other organizations, mobilization of new resources would greatly accelerate HIV-1 vaccine efficacy studies. Three potential sources for new funding include industry, governments, and additional philanthropy. Pharmaceutical companies may provide direct support for development activities, including clinical efficacy trials, if they are sufficiently interested in a particular vaccine product. Additional investment of governments worldwide would be highly enabling for the field. Finally, new philanthropic funding will also accelerate the development of an HIV-1 vaccine, as exemplified by the Ragon Institute of MGH, MIT, and Harvard. Accelerating clinical efficacy trials of HIV-1 vaccine candidates also requires multiple distinct and scientifically promising vaccine candidates in preclinical and early phase clinical studies to be ready for efficacy testing. It is therefore essential to maintain and expand a diverse portfolio of vaccine concepts. For example, novel Env immunogens are being developed by multiple groups to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies as well as to optimize functional non-neutralizing antibodies; a series of new vectors have been explored that expand the breadth and efficacy of virus-specific T cell responses; and potential global antigens have been developed that begin to address the challenge of global virus diversity. A robust pipeline of new concepts and fresh perspectives will also require the engagement and encouragement of young and early career investigators, particularly those from the developing world. Expanding preclinical efficacy studies will also help to support the rationale for clinical efficacy trials. Although the ability of nonhuman primate challenge studies to predict the outcomes of clinical efficacy trials still remains uncertain, stringent SIV and SHIV challenges in rhesus monkeys represent the most robust model for assessing vaccine candidates prior to clinical efficacy trials. Such preclinical challenge studies should therefore be expanded, particularly for vaccine candidates under consideration for efficacy trials. When clinical efficacy data with these vaccines become available, the clinical results can then be used to refine and to improve the preclinical models. HIV-1 vaccine development will likely be an iterative process. Robust basic research must continue but needs to be matched with clinical efficacy testing of promising new vaccine candidates. Information learned from each rigorous efficacy trial will be pivotal and will provide clear directions for the field. A more detailed understanding of immune correlates of protection will also be obtained from these clinical efficacy trials and may, ultimately, reduce the need to conduct large studies for each new vaccine concept. However, at the present time, there is no way to determine whether a vaccine will prevent HIV-1 infection in humans other than clinical efficacy studies in which incident new HIV-1 infections are the primary endpoint. There are numerous reasons for optimism in the HIV-1 vaccine field. The RV144 study showed that an HIV-1 vaccine is possible, and several novel vaccine candidates have demonstrated unprecedented efficacy in stringent nonhuman primate challenge studies. Our basic understanding of HIV-1-specific humoral and cellular immunity has expanded considerably, and preclinical and clinical immune correlates of protection have been identified in certain contexts. Increasing the momentum to accelerate the conduct of efficacy trials will substantially accelerate the development of a safe and effective HIV-1 vaccine, which will presumably be required to control the global HIV-1 pandemic.

Methods This study included 36 resected samples in 18 patients. To evaluate the PA manifestation of microcalcifications in PAI, gray level histogram and co-occurrence matrix (COM) texture parameters were extracted from the 3 fixed ROI US and PA images, respectively, per sample. We compared the textural parameters obtained from specimen PAIs between samples with punctate microcalcifications on specimen radiography and those without microcalcifications. Results On specimen US, the mean value (2748.4±862.5) of samples with microcalcifications on specimen radiography was higher than that (1961.9±780.2) of those without microcalcifications (P = 0.007). However, there were no significant differences in textural parameters obtained from specimen PAIs between samples with punctate microcalcifications on specimen radiography and those without when applying both the mean value of the three slices of thyroid specimens and the value of the thyroid specimen slice which had the highest value of the mean values in specimen US. Conclusion PAI did not show significant PA contrast on thyroid microcalcifications indicating that the experimental setup and protocols should be enhanced, e.g., method of complete blood rejection from ex vivo specimens, the multi-wavelength spectroscopic PA imaging method which can solely extract the PA signal from microcalcifications even with high spectral interferences, or PA imaging with narrower slice thickness using 2-dimensional array transducer, etc."

TB-IRIS could be associated with an exaggerated immune response to TB-antigens. We compared the recovery of IFNγ responses to recall and TB-antigens and explored in vitro innate cytokine production in TB-IRIS patients.In a prospective cohort study of HIV-TB co-infected patients treated for TB before ART initiation, we compared 18 patients who developed TB-IRIS with 18 non-IRIS controls matched for age, sex and CD4 count. We analyzed IFNγ ELISpot responses to CMV, influenza, TB and LPS before ART and during TB-IRIS. CMV and LPS stimulated ELISpot supernatants were subsequently evaluated for production of IL-12p70, IL-6, TNFα and IL-10 by Luminex.Before ART, all responses were similar between TB-IRIS patients and non-IRIS controls. During TB-IRIS, IFNγ responses to TB and influenza antigens were comparable between TB-IRIS patients and non-IRIS controls, but responses to CMV and LPS remained significantly lower in TB-IRIS patients. Production of innate cytokines was similar between TB-IRIS patients and non-IRIS controls. However, upon LPS stimulation, IL-6/IL-10 and TNFα/IL-10 ratios were increased in TB-IRIS patients compared to non-IRIS controls.TB-IRIS patients did not display excessive IFNγ responses to TB-antigens. In contrast, the reconstitution of CMV and LPS responses was delayed in the TB-IRIS group. For LPS, this was linked with a pro-inflammatory shift in the innate cytokine balance. These data are in support of a prominent role of the innate immune system in TB-IRIS."

https://openalex.org/W2005329033,"The number of eggs ovulated varies within and between species and is influenced by many variables. However, the regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. We previously demonstrated a key role for the oocyte because mice generating oocytes deficient in core 1-derived O-glycans ovulate ~40-50% more eggs than Controls. Here we analyze the basis of this phenotype using Mutant [core 1 β1, 3-galactosyltransferase 1 (C1galt1)FF: zona pellucida glycoprotein 3 Cre (ZP3Cre)] and Control (C1galt1FF) female mice. In culture, Mutant follicles exhibited delayed antrum formation [indicative of follicle stimulant hormone (FSH) dependence] and increased sensitivity to FSH. Although the Mutant estrous cycle was extended, comprehensive endocrine changes were not observed; rather FSH, LH, inhibin B, and anti-Mullerian hormone were temporally altered, revealing estrous cycle stage-specific modifications to the hypothalamic-pituitarygonadal axis. At proestrus, when FSH levels were decreased in Mutants, ovaries contained more, smaller, preantral follicles. Mutant follicles exhibited reduced levels of apoptosis, and both B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and BCL-2-associated X protein (Bax) were altered compared with Controls. Mutant ovaries also had an increase in the expression ratio of growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF9): bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP15) at diestrus. On the basis of these data, we propose that modified oocyte glycoproteins alter GDF9:BMP15 expression modifying follicle development resulting in the generation of more follicles. Thus, the oocyte is a key regulator of follicle development and has a crucial role in determining ovulation rate.—Grasa, P., Ploutarchou, P., Williams, S. A.

https://openalex.org/W2001291871,"Regucalcin (RGN) is a mammalian Ca2+-binding protein that plays an important role in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Recently, RGN has been identified as a target gene for sex steroid hormones in the prostate glands and testis of rats and humans, but no studies have focused on RGN expression in bovine tissues. Thus, in the present study, we examined RGN mRNA and protein expression in the different tissues and organs of veal calves and beef cattle. Moreover, we investigated whether RGN expression is controlled through sex steroid hormones in bovine target tissues, namely the bulbo-urethral and prostate glands and the testis. Sex steroid hormones are still illegally used in bovine husbandry to increase muscle mass. The screening of the regulation and function of anabolic sex steroids via modified gene expression levels in various tissues represents a new approach for the detection of illicit drug treatments. Herein, we used quantitative PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses to demonstrate RGN mRNA and protein expression in bovine tissues. In addition, estrogen administration down-regulated RGN gene expression in the accessory sex glands of veal calves and beef cattle, while androgen treatment reduced RGN gene expression only in the testis. The confirmation of the regulation of RGN gene expression through sex steroid hormones might facilitate the potential detection of hormone abuse in bovine husbandry. Particularly, the specific response in the testis suggests that this tissue is ideal for the detection of illicit androgen administration in veal calves and beef cattle."
https://openalex.org/W2001200520,"The activity of cytochrome P450 enzymes depends on the enzyme NADPH P450 oxidoreductase (POR). The aim of this study was to investigate the activity of the equine CYP3A94 using a system that allows to regulate the POR protein levels in mammalian cells. CYP3A94 and the equine POR were heterologously expressed in V79 cells. In the system used, the POR protein regulation is based on a destabilizing domain (DD) that transfers its instability to a fused protein. The resulting fusion protein is therefore degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Addition of “Shield-1” prevents the DD fusion protein from degradation. The change of POR levels at different Shield-1 concentrations was demonstrated by cytochrome c reduction, Western immunoblot analysis, and immunocytochemistry. The alteration of CYP3A94 activity was investigated using a substrate (BFC) known to detect CYP3A4 activity. Equine CYP3A94 was demonstrated to be metabolically active and its activity could be significantly elevated by co-expression of POR. Cytochrome c reduction was significantly increased in V79-CYP3A94/DD-POR cells compared to V79-CYP3A94 cells. Surprisingly, incubation with different Shield-1 concentrations resulted in a decrease in POR protein shown by Western immunoblot analysis. Cytochrome c reduction did not change significantly, but the CYP3A94 activity decreased more than 4-fold after incubation with 500 nM and 1 µM Shield-1 for 24 hours. No differences were obtained when V79-CYP3A94 POR cells with and without Shield-1 were compared. The basal activity levels of V79-CYP3A94/DD-POR cells were unexpectedly high, indicating that DD/POR is not degraded without Shield-1. Shield-1 decreased POR protein levels and CYP3A94 activity suggesting that Shield-1 might impair POR activity by an unknown mechanism. Although regulation of POR with the pPTuner system could not be obtained, the cell line V79-CYP3A94/DD-POR system can be used for further experiments to characterize the equine CYP3A94 since the CYP activity was significantly enhanced with co-expressed POR."

Men with CD4 counts <350 had higher baseline mean log10 plasma viral load than those with CD4 counts ≧350 cells/mm3 (4.715 vs 4.217 cps/mL, respectively, p = 0.0005). Compared to baseline, there was no statistically significant increase in post-MC HIV plasma viral loads irrespective of CD4. Multivariate analysis showed that higher baseline log10 plasma viral load was significantly associated with reduction in mean log10 plasma viral load following MC (coef. = −0.134, p<0.001). Conclusion We observed no increase in plasma HIV viral load following MC in HIV-infected, HAART naïve men."
