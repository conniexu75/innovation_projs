https://openalex.org/W1621991227,"Bone marrow stem cells give rise to a variety of hematopoietic lineages and repopulate the blood throughout adult life. We show that, in a strain of mice incapable of developing cells of the myeloid and lymphoid lineages, transplanted adult bone marrow cells migrated into the brain and differentiated into cells that expressed neuron-specific antigens. These findings raise the possibility that bone marrow-derived cells may provide an alternative source of neurons in patients with neurodegenerative diseases or central nervous system injury."
https://openalex.org/W1970895440,"After intravascular delivery of genetically marked adult mouse bone marrow into lethally irradiated normal adult hosts, donor-derived cells expressing neuronal proteins (neuronal phenotypes) developed in the central nervous system. Flow cytometry revealed a population of donor-derived cells in the brain with characteristics distinct from bone marrow. Confocal microscopy of individual cells showed that hundreds of marrow-derived cells in brain sections expressed gene products typical of neurons (NeuN, 200-kilodalton neurofilament, and class III beta-tubulin) and were able to activate the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). The generation of neuronal phenotypes in the adult brain 1 to 6 months after an adult bone marrow transplant demonstrates a remarkable plasticity of adult tissues with potential clinical applications."

A striking exception occurs in sitosterolemia, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by increased intestinal absorption and decreased biliary excretion of dietary sterols, hypercholesterolemia, and premature coronary atherosclerosis. We identified seven different mutations in two adjacent, oppositely oriented genes that encode new members of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family (six mutations in ABCG8 and one in ABCG5) in nine patients with sitosterolemia. The two genes are expressed at highest levels in liver and intestine and, in mice, cholesterol feeding up-regulates expressions of both genes. These data suggest that ABCG5 and ABCG8 normally cooperate to limit intestinal absorption and to promote biliary excretion of sterols, and that mutated forms of these transporters predispose to sterol accumulation and atherosclerosis."

https://openalex.org/W2159744102,"OX2 (CD200) is a broadly expressed membrane glycoprotein, shown here to be important for regulation of the macrophage lineage. In mice lacking CD200, macrophage lineage cells, including brain microglia, exhibited an activated phenotype and were more numerous. Upon facial nerve transection, damaged CD200-deficient neurons elicited an accelerated microglial response. Lack of CD200 resulted in a more rapid onset of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Outside the brain, disruption of CD200-CD200 receptor interaction precipitated susceptibility to collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice normally resistant to this disease. Thus, in diverse tissues OX2 delivers an inhibitory signal for the macrophage lineage."
https://openalex.org/W1629173918,"Experimental implementations of quantum computer architectures are now being investigated in many different physical settings. The full set of requirements that must be met to make quantum computing a reality in the laboratory [1] is daunting, involving capabilities well beyond the present state of the art. In this report we develop a significant simplification of these requirements that can be applied in many recent solid-state approaches, using quantum dots [2], and using donor-atom nuclear spins [3] or electron spins [4]. In these approaches, the basic two-qubit quantum gate is generated by a tunable Heisenberg interaction (the Hamiltonian is $H_{ij}=J(t){\vec S}_i\cdot{\vec S}_j$ between spins $i$ and $j$), while the one-qubit gates require the control of a local Zeeman field. Compared to the Heisenberg operation, the one-qubit operations are significantly slower and require substantially greater materials and device complexity, which may also contribute to increasing the decoherence rate. Here we introduce an explicit scheme in which the Heisenberg interaction alone suffices to exactly implement any quantum computer circuit, at a price of a factor of three in additional qubits and about a factor of ten in additional two-qubit operations. Even at this cost, the ability to eliminate the complexity of one-qubit operations should accelerate progress towards these solid-state implementations of quantum computation."

https://openalex.org/W1918265548,"The connection of electrical leads to wire-like molecules is a logical step in the development of molecular electronics, but also allows studies of fundamental physics. For example, metallic carbon nanotubes are quantum wires that have been found to act as one-dimensional quantum dots, Luttinger liquids, proximity-induced superconductors and ballistic and diffusive one-dimensional metals. Here we report that electrically contacted single-walled carbon nanotubes can serve as powerful probes of Kondo physics, demonstrating the universality of the Kondo effect. Arising in the prototypical case from the interaction between a localized impurity magnetic moment and delocalized electrons in a metallic host, the Kondo effect has been used to explain enhanced low-temperature scattering from magnetic impurities in metals, and also occurs in transport through semiconductor quantum dots. The far greater tunability of dots (in our case, nanotubes) compared with atomic impurities renders new classes of Kondo-like effects accessible. Our nanotube devices differ from previous systems in which Kondo effects have been observed, in that they are one-dimensional quantum dots with three-dimensional metal (gold) reservoirs. This allows us to observe Kondo resonances for very large electron numbers (N) in the dot, and approaching the unitary limit (where the transmission reaches its maximum possible value). Moreover, we detect a previously unobserved Kondo effect, occurring for even values of N in a magnetic field."
https://openalex.org/W2130561005,"Abundant, micrometer-scale, spherical aggregates of 2- to 5-nanometer-diameter sphalerite (ZnS) particles formed within natural biofilms dominated by relatively aerotolerant sulfate-reducing bacteria of the family Desulfobacteriaceae. The biofilm zinc concentration is about 10(6) times that of associated groundwater (0.09 to 1.1 parts per million zinc). Sphalerite also concentrates arsenic (0.01 weight %) and selenium (0.004 weight %). The almost monomineralic product results from buffering of sulfide concentrations at low values by sphalerite precipitation. These results show how microbes control metal concentrations in groundwater- and wetland-based remediation systems and suggest biological routes for formation of some low-temperature ZnS deposits."

The pro-apoptotic protein BID underwent posttranslational (rather than classic cotranslational) N-myristoylation when cleavage by caspase 8 caused exposure of a glycine residue. N-myristoylation enabled the targeting of a complex of p7 and myristoylated p15 fragments of BID to artificial membranes bearing the lipid composition of mitochondria, as well as to intact mitochondria. This post-proteolytic N-myristoylation serves as an activating switch, enhancing BID-induced release of cytochrome c and cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2110945178,"Area 5 in the parietal lobe of the primate brain is thought to be involved in monitoring the posture and movement of the body. In this study, neurons in monkey area 5 were found to encode the position of the monkey's arm while it was covered from view. The same neurons also responded to the position of a visible, realistic false arm. The neurons were not sensitive to the sight of unrealistic substitutes for the arm and were able to distinguish a right from a left arm. These neurons appear to combine visual and somatosensory signals in order to monitor the configuration of the limbs. They could form the basis of the complex body schema that we constantly use to adjust posture and guide movement."

Analysis of staged chimeric mouse embryos with a high contribution from embryonic stem cells with a functional null allele for ADAR1 revealed a heterozygous embryonic-lethal phenotype. Most ADAR1 +/− chimeric embryos died before embryonic day 14 with defects in the hematopoietic system. Our results suggest the importance of regulated levels of ADAR1 expression, which is critical for embryonic erythropoiesis in the liver."
https://openalex.org/W2007716988,"It has been postulated that an inflammatory response after cutaneous wounding is a prerequisite for healing, and inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), might be intimately involved in this process. IL-6-deficient transgenic mice (IL-6 KO) displayed significantly delayed cutaneous wound healing compared with wild-type control animals, requiring up to threefold longer to heal. This was characterized by minimal epithelial bridge formation, decreased inflammation, and granulation tissue formation. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays of wound tissue from IL-6 KO mice, decreased AP-1 transcription factor activation was shown compared with wild-type mice 16 h after wounding. In situ hybridization of wound tissue from wild-type mice revealed IL-6 mRNA expression primarily in the epidermis at the leading edge of the wound. Delayed wound healing in IL-6 KO mice was reversed with a single dose of recombinant murine IL-6 or intradermal injection of an expression plasmid containing the full-length murine IL-6 cDNA. Treatment with rmIL-6 also reconstituted wound healing in dexamethasone-treated immunosuppressed mice. The results of this study may indicate a potential use for IL-6 therapeutically where cutaneous wound healing is impaired."

Within the lunar meteorite breccias MAC 88105, QUE 93069, DaG 262, and DaG 400, seven to nine different impact events are represented with 40Ar-39Ar ages between 2.76 and 3.92 billion years ago (Ga). The lack of impact melt older than 3.92 Ga supports the concept of a short, intense period of bombardment in the Earth-moon system at approximately 3.9 Ga. This was an anomalous spike of impact activity on the otherwise declining impact- frequency curve."
https://openalex.org/W2129118672,"Ischemic disorders of the heart can cause an irreversible loss of cardiomyocytes resulting in a substantial decrease of cardiac output. The therapy of choice is heart transplantation, a technique that is hampered by the low number of donor organs. In the present study, we describe the specific labeling, rapid but gentle purification and characterization of cardiomyocytes derived from mouse pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells. To isolate the subpopulation of ventricular-like cardiomyocytes, ES cells were stable transfected with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under transcriptional control of the ventricular-specific 2.1 kb myosin light chain-2v (MLC-2v) promoter and the 0.5 kb enhancer element of the cytomegalovirus (CMV(enh).). First fluorescent cells were detected at day 6 + 8 of differentiation within EBs. Four weeks after initiation of differentiation 25% of the cardiomyocyte population displayed fluorescence. Immunohistochemistry revealed the exclusive cardiomyogenic nature of EGFP-positive cells. This was further corroborated by electrophysiological studies where preferentially ventricular phenotypes, but no pacemaker-like cardiomyocytes, were detected among the EGFP-positive population. The enzymatic digestion of EBs, followed by Percoll gradient centrifugation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting, resulted in a 97% pure population of cardiomyocytes. Based on this study, ventricular-like cardiomyocytes can be generated in vitro from EBs and labeled using CMV(enh)./MLC-2v-driven marker genes facilitating an efficient purification. This method may become an important tool for future cell replacement therapy of ischemic cardiomyopathy especially after the proof of somatic differentiation of human ES cells in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2084228496,"Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) is a VEGF(165) and semaphorin receptor expressed by vascular endothelial cells (EC) and tumor cells. The function of NRP1 in tumor cells is unknown. NRP1 was overexpressed in Dunning rat prostate carcinoma AT2.1 cells using a tetracycline-inducible promoter. Concomitant with increased NRP1 expression in response to a tetracycline homologue, doxycycline (Dox), basal cell motility, and VEGF(165) binding were increased three- to fourfold in vitro. However, induction of NRP1 did not affect tumor cell proliferation. When rats injected with AT2.1/NRP1 tumor cells were fed Dox, NRP1 synthesis was induced in vivo and AT2.1 cell tumor size was increased 2.5- to 7-fold in a 3-4 wk period compared to controls. The larger tumors with induced NRP1 expression were characterized by markedly increased microvessel density, increased proliferating EC, dilated blood vessels, and notably less tumor cell apoptosis compared to noninduced controls. It was concluded that NRP1 expression results in enlarged tumors associated with substantially enhanced tumor angiogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2035004399,"Oxidized and cross-linked proteins tend to accumulate in aging cells. Declining activity of proteolytic enzymes, particularly the proteasome, has been proposed as a possible explanation for this phenomenon, and direct inhibition of the proteasome by oxidized and cross-linked proteins has been demonstrated in vitro. We have further examined this hypothesis during both proliferative senescence (this paper) and postmitotic senescence (see the accompanying paper, ref 1 ) of human BJ fibroblasts. During proliferative senescence, we found a marked decline in all proteasome activities (trypsin-like activity, chymotrypsin-like activity, and peptidyl-glutamyl-hydrolyzing activity) and in lysosomal cathepsin activity. Despite the loss of proteasome activity, there was no concomitant change in cellular levels of actual proteasome protein (immunoassays) or in the steady-state levels of mRNAs for essential proteasome subunits. The decline in proteasome activities and lysosomal cathepsin activities was accompanied by dramatic increases in the accumulation of oxidized and cross-linked proteins. Furthermore, as proliferation stage increased, cells exhibited a decreasing ability to degrade the oxidatively damaged proteins generated by an acute, experimentally applied oxidative stress. Thus, oxidized and cross-linked proteins accumulated rapidly in cells of higher proliferation stages. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that proteasome is progressively inhibited by small accumulations of oxidized and cross-linked proteins during proliferative senescence until late proliferation stages, when so much proteasome activity has been lost that oxidized proteins accumulate at ever-increasing rates. Lysosomes attempt to deal with the accumulating oxidized and cross-linked proteins, but declining lysosomal cathepsin activity apparently limits their effectiveness. This hypothesis, which may explain the progressive intracellular accumulation of oxidized and cross-linked proteins in aging, is further explored during postmitotic senescence in the accompanying paper (1)."
https://openalex.org/W2172238670,"A comprehensive investigation of polar stratospheric clouds was performed on 25 January 2000 with instruments onboard a balloon gondola flown from Kiruna, Sweden. Cloud layers were repeatedly encountered at altitudes between 20 and 24 kilometers over a wide range of atmospheric temperatures (185 to 197 kelvin). Particle composition analysis showed that a large fraction of the cloud layers was composed of nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) particles, containing water and nitric acid at a molar ratio of 3:1; this confirmed that these long-sought solid crystals exist well above ice formation temperatures. The presence of NAT particles enhances the potential for chlorine activation with subsequent ozone destruction in polar regions, particularly in early and late winter."
https://openalex.org/W1998869127,"High-precision magnesium isotope measurements of whole chondrules from the Allende carbonaceous chondrite meteorite show that some aluminum-rich Allende chondrules formed at or near the time of formation of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions and that some others formed later and incorporated precursors previously enriched in magnesium-26. Chondrule magnesium-25/magnesium-24 correlates with [magnesium]/[aluminum] and size, the aluminum-rich, smaller chondrules being the most enriched in the heavy isotopes of magnesium. These relations imply that high gas pressures prevailed during chondrule formation in the solar nebula."
https://openalex.org/W2094133105,"We investigated the expression of purinoceptors in human dendritic cells, providing functional, pharmacological, and biochemical evidence that immature and mature cells express P2Y and P2X subtypes, coupled to increase in the intracellular Ca(2+), membrane depolarization, and secretion of inflammatory cytokines. The ATP-activated Ca(2+) change was biphasic, with a fast release from intracellular stores and a delayed influx across the plasma membrane. A prolonged exposure to ATP was toxic to dendritic cells that swelled, lost typical dendrites, became phase lucent, detached from the substrate, and eventually died. These changes were highly suggestive of expression of the cytotoxic receptor P2X(7), as confirmed by ability of dendritic cells to become permeant to membrane impermeant dyes such as Lucifer yellow or ethidium bromide. The P2X(7) receptor ligand 2',3'-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP was a better agonist then ATP for Ca(2+) increase and plasma membrane depolarization. Oxidized ATP, a covalent blocker of P2X receptors, and the selective P2X(7) antagonist KN-62 inhibited both permeabilization and Ca(2+) changes induced by ATP. The following purinoceptors were expressed by immature and mature dendritic cells: P2Y(1), P2Y(2), P2Y(5), P2Y(11) and P2X(1), P2X(4), P2X(7). Finally, stimulation of LPS-matured cells with ATP triggered release of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha. Purinoceptors may provide a new avenue to modulation of dendritic cells function."
https://openalex.org/W2159604489,"We report on the generation of picosecond self–mode-locked pulses from midinfrared quantum cascade lasers, at wavelengths within the important molecular fingerprint region. These devices are based on intersubband electron transitions in semiconductor nanostructures, which are characterized by some of the largest optical nonlinearities observed in nature and by picosecond relaxation lifetimes. Our results are interpreted with a model in which one of these nonlinearities, the intensity-dependent refractive index of the lasing transition, creates a nonlinear waveguide where the optical losses decrease with increasing intensity. This favors the generation of ultrashort pulses, because of their larger instantaneous intensity relative to continuous-wave emission."

https://openalex.org/W2017658570,"Oxidized/cross-linked intracellular protein materials, known as ceroid pigment, age pigment, or lipofuscin, accumulate in postmitotic tissues. It is unclear, however, whether diminishing proteolytic capacities play a role in the accumulation of such oxidized intracellular proteins. Previous studies revealed that the proteasome is responsible for the degradation of most oxidized soluble cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins and, we propose, for the prevention of such damage accumulations. The present investigation was undertaken to test the changes in protein turnover, proteasome activity, lysosome activity, and protein oxidation status during the aging of nondividing cells. Since the companion paper shows that both proteasome activity and the overall protein turnover decline during proliferative senescence whereas the accumulation of oxidized proteins increases significantly, we decided to use the same human BJ fibroblasts, this time at confluency, at different PD levels (including those that are essentially postmitotic) to investigate the same parameters under conditions where cells do not divide. We find that the activity of the cytosolic proteasome declines dramatically during senescence of nondividing BJ fibroblasts. The peptidyl-glutamyl-hydrolyzing activity was particularly affected. This decline in proteasome activity was accompanied by a decrease in the overall turnover of short-lived (radiolabeled) proteins in the nondividing BJ fibroblasts. On the other hand, no decrease in the actual cellular proteasome content, as judged by immunoblots, was found. The decline in the activity of the proteasome was also accompanied by an increased accumulation of oxidized proteins, especially of oxidized and cross-linked material. Unlike the loss of lysosomal function seen in our accompanying studies of proliferative senescence (1), however, the present study of hyperoxic senescence in nondividing cells actually revealed marked increases in lysosomal cathepsin activity in all but the very 'oldest' postmitotic cells. Our comparative studies of proliferating (1) and nonproliferating (this paper) human BJ fibroblasts reveal a good correlation between the accumulation of oxidized/cross-linked proteins and the decline in proteasome activity and overall cellular protein turnover during in vitro senescence, which may predict a causal relationship during actual cellular aging."
https://openalex.org/W1986915396,"The human ether-a-go-go-related genes (herg) are expressed in tissues other than heart and brain where the HERG K(+) channels are known to regulate the repolarization of the heart action potential and the neuronal spike-frequency accommodation. We provide evidence that herg1 transcripts are present in human pancreatic islets that were used to study both insulin secretion and electrical activity with radioimmunoassay and single cell perforated patch-clamp techniques, respectively. Glucose- and arginine-induced islets insulin secretion data suggested a net increase of release under perfusion with antiarrhythmic drugs known to selectively block HERG channels. Indeed we could routinely isolate a K(+) current that was recognized as biophysically and pharmacologically similar to the HERG current. An analysis of the glucose- and arginine-induced electrical activity (several applications during 30 min) in terms of firing frequency and putative insulin release was done in control and in the presence of selective blockers of HERG channels: the firing frequency and the release increased by 32% and 77%, respectively. It is concluded that HERG channels have a crucial role in regulating insulin secretion and firing of human beta-cells. This raises the possibility that some genetically characterized hyperinsulinemic diseases of unknown origin might involve mutations in the HERG channels."
https://openalex.org/W2126207219,"G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are involved in the regulation of many G-protein-coupled receptors. As opposed to the other GRKs, such as rhodopsin kinase (GRK1) or beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK, GRK2), no receptor substrate for GRK4 has been so far identified. Here we show that GRK4 is expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells, where it regulates mGlu(1) metabotropic glutamate receptors, as indicated by the following: 1) When coexpressed in heterologous cells (HEK293), mGlu(1) receptor signaling was desensitized by GRK4 in an agonist-dependent manner (homologous desensitization). 2) In transfected HEK293 and in cultured Purkinje cells, the exposure to glutamate agonists induced internalization of the receptor and redistribution of GRK4. There was a substantial colocalization of the receptor and kinase both under basal condition and after internalization. 3) Kinase activity was necessary for desensitizing mGlu(1a) receptor and agonist-dependent phosphorylation of this receptor was also documented. 4) Antisense treatment of cultured Purkinje cells, which significantly reduced the levels of GRK4 expression, induced a marked modification of the mGlu(1)-mediated functional response, consistent with an impaired receptor desensitization. The critical role for GRK4 in regulating mGlu(1) receptors implicates a major involvement of this kinase in the physiology of Purkinje cell and in motor learning."

https://openalex.org/W1977093166,"We previously reported that the binding of two-chain high molecular weight kininogen (HKa) to endothelial cells may occur through interactions with endothelial urokinase receptors. Since the binding of urokinase to urokinase receptors activates signaling responses and may stimulate mitogenesis, we assessed the effect of HKa binding on endothelial cell proliferation. Unexpectedly, HKa inhibited proliferation in response to several growth factors, with 50% inhibition caused by approximately 10 nM HKa. This activity was Zn(2+) dependent and not shared by either single-chain high molecular weight kininogen (HK) or low molecular weight kininogen. HKa selectively inhibited the proliferation of human umbilical vein and dermal microvascular endothelial cells, but did not affect that of umbilical vein or human aortic smooth muscle cells, trophoblasts, fibroblasts, or carcinoma cells. Inhibition of endothelial proliferation by HKa was associated with endothelial cell apoptosis and unaffected by antibodies that block the binding of HK or HKa to any of their known endothelial receptors. Recombinant HK domain 5 displayed activity similar to that of HKa. In vivo, HKa inhibited neovascularization of subcutaneously implanted Matrigel plugs, as well as rat corneal angiogenesis. These results demonstrate that HKa is a novel inhibitor of angiogenesis, whose activity is dependent on the unique conformation of the two-chain molecule."

To identify molecules relevant for angiogenesis, we performed mRNA fingerprinting and subsequent Northern blot analysis using bovine cord-forming vs. monolayer-forming endothelial cells (EC) in vitro and staged bovine corpora lutea in vivo. We detected the receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1), the specific receptor for activated protein kinase C β (PKCβ), to be up-regulated in bovine cord-forming EC in vitro and in angiogenically active stages of bovine corpora lutea in vivo. Thereafter we established and determined the complete bovine RACK1 cDNA sequence. RACK1 was massively induced in subconfluent vs. contact-inhibited bovine EC, during angiogenesis in vitro, active phases of the murine ovarian cycle, human tumor angiogenesis, and in cancer cells in vivo as assessed by quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization. RACK1 transcripts were localized to proliferating EC in vitro and the endothelium of tumor neovascularizations in vivo by in situ hybridization. PKCβ plays an important role in angiogenesis and cancer growth.

https://openalex.org/W2062879793,"We have previously demonstrated that halofuginone, a low molecular weight quinazolinone alkaloid, is a potent inhibitor of collagen alpha1(I) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) gene expression. Halofuginone also effectively suppresses tumor progression and metastasis in mice. These results together with the well-documented role of extracellular matrix (ECM) components and matrix degrading enzymes in formation of new blood vessels led us to investigate the effect of halofuginone on the angiogenic process. In a variety of experimental system, representing sequential events in the angiogenic cascade, halofuginone treatment resulted in profound inhibitory effect. Among these are the abrogation of endothelial cell MMP-2 expression and basement membrane invasion, capillary tube formation, and vascular sprouting, as well as deposition of subendothelial ECM. The most conclusive anti-angiogenic activity of halofuginone was demonstrated in vivo (mouse corneal micropocket assay) by showing a marked inhibition of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) -induced neovascularization in response to systemic administration of halofuginone, either i.p. or in the diet. The ability of halofuginone to interfere with key events in neovascularization, together with its oral bioavailability and safe use as an anti-parasitic agent, make it a promising drug for further evaluation in the treatment of a wide range of diseases associated with pathological angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1994145586,"Natural enemy-victim interactions are of major applied importance and of fundamental interest to ecologists. A key question is what stabilizes these interactions, allowing the long-term coexistence of the two species. Three main theoretical explanations have been proposed: behavioral responses, time-dependent factors such as delayed density dependence, and spatial heterogeneity. Here, using the powerful moment-closure technique, we show a fundamental equivalence between these three elements. Limited movement by organisms is a ubiquitous feature of ecological systems, allowing spatial structure to develop; we show that the effects of this can be naturally described in terms of time lags or within-generation functional responses."
https://openalex.org/W2132971990,"Whereas retinoic acids control nuclear events, a second class of retinol metabolites, that is, the hydroxylated forms exemplified by 14-hydroxy-retro-retinol (HRR), operate primarily in the cytoplasm. They function as regulatory cofactors for cell survival/cell death decisions. In accordance with these biological aspects, we demonstrate that these retinoids bound protein kinase C (PKC) alpha with nanomolar affinity and markedly enhance the activation of PKC alpha and the entire downstream MAP kinase pathway by reactive oxygen species. HRR was 10 times more efficient than retinol, and the optimum doses are 10-7 and 10-6 M, respectively. PKC alpha activation was reversed rapidly by imposition of reducing conditions. The retinoid binding site was mapped to the first cysteine-rich region in the regulatory domain, C1A, yet was distinct from the binding sites of diacylglycerol and phorbol esters. The C1B domain bound retinoids poorly. The emerging theme is that retinoids serve as redox regulators of protein kinase C."

https://openalex.org/W2014187604,"Although frontal cortex is thought to be important in controlling behavior across long periods of time, most studies of this area concentrate on neuronal responses instantaneously relevant to the current task. In order to investigate the relationship of frontal activity to behavior over longer time periods, we trained rhesus monkeys on a difficult oculomotor task. Their performance fluctuated during the day, and the activity of prefrontal neurons, even measured while the monkeys waited for the targets to appear at the beginning of each set of trials, correlated with performance in a probabilistic rather than a determinist manner: neurons reflected past or predicted future performance, much more than they reflected current performance. We suggest that this activity is related to processes such as arousal or motivation that set the tone for behavior rather than controlling it on a millisecond basis, and could result from ascending pathways that utilize slow, second-messenger synaptic processes."
https://openalex.org/W2059292064,"We tested the hypothesis that the mechanism of action of the antifolate drug trimethoprim is through accumulation of bacterial dihydrofolate resulting in depletion of tetrahydrofolate coenzymes required for purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis. The folate pool of a strain of Escherichia coli (NCIMB 8879) was prelabeled with the folate biosynthetic precursor [(3)H]-p-aminobenzoic acid before treatment with trimethoprim. Folates in untreated E. coli were present as tetrahydrofolate coenzymes. In trimethoprim-treated cells, however, a rapid transient accumulation of dihydrofolate occurred, followed by complete conversion of all forms of folate to cleaved catabolites (pteridines and para-aminobenzoylglutamate) and the stable nonreduced form of the vitamin, folic acid. Both para-aminobenzoylglutamate and folic acid were present in the cell in the form of polyglutamates. Removal of trimethoprim resulted in the reconversion of the accumulated folic acid to tetrahydrofolate cofactors for subsequent participation in the one-carbon cycle. Whereas irreversible catabolism is probably bactericidal, conversion to folic acid may constitute a bacteriostatic mechanism since, as we show, folic acid can be used by the bacteria and proliferation is resumed once trimethoprim is removed. Thus, the clinical effectiveness of this important drug may depend on the extent to which the processes of either catabolism or folic acid production occur in different bacteria or during different therapeutic regimes."

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effect of exogenously transfected MT3-MMP in a tissue remodeling system: growth and tubulogenesis of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in collagen gels. Although the parental cells require MMP activities for both growth and tubulogenesis, over-expression of wild-type MT3-MMP, but not its catalytically inactive mutant, leads to further enhancement of both processes, independent of its downstream substrate, progelatinase A. Mechanistically, MT3-MMP accomplishes such an effect by displaying on cell surfaces as active species, ready to activate progelatinase A or degrade ECM molecules. These data strongly suggest that MT3-MMP possesses the potential to directly enhance the growth and invasiveness of cells in vivo, two critical processes for development and carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1983888037,"We investigated the mechanisms implicated in beta-cell mass reduction observed during late fetal and early postnatal malnutrition in the rat. Beta-cell regeneration, including proliferation and neogenesis, was studied after neonatal beta-cell destruction by streptozotocin (STZ). STZ was injected at birth and maternal food restriction was continued until weaning. Beta-cell mass, proliferation, and islet number were quantified by morphometrical measurements on pancreatic sections in STZ-injected normal (C-STZ) and malnourished (R-STZ) rats, with noninjected C and R rats as controls. At day 4, only 20% of the beta cell-mass remained in C-STZ rats. It regenerated to 50% that of noninjected controls, mainly through active neogenesis, as shown by the entire recovery of islet number/cm(2), and also through moderately increased beta-cell proliferation. In contrast, beta-cell mass from R-STZ animals poorly regenerated, despite a dramatic increase of beta-cell proliferation, because islet number/cm(2) recovered insufficiently. In conclusion, perinatal malnutrition impairs neogenesis and the capacity of beta-cell regeneration by neogenesis but preserves beta-cell proliferation, which remains the elective choice to increase beta-cell mass. These results provide an explanation for the impaired capacity of malnourished animals to adapt their beta-cell mass during aging or pregnancy, which aggravate glucose tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2168844822,"The definition of signaling pathways in endothelial cells has been hampered by the difficulty of transiently transfecting these cells with high efficiency. This investigation was undertaken to develop an efficient technique for the transfection of endothelial cells for functional analyses. Cells cotransfected with plasmid expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the plasmid of interest were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) based on GFP expression. In the sorted cell population, a 2.5-fold enhancement in the number of cells expressing the gene of interest was observed, as confirmed by FACS analysis and Western blotting. Sorted cells retained functional properties, as demonstrated by chemotaxis to the agonist sphingosine 1-phosphate (SPP). To demonstrate the usefulness of this method for defining cellular signaling pathways, cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding GFP and the carboxyl-terminal domain of the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARKct), which inhibits signaling through the beta gamma dimer of heterotrimeric G-proteins. SPP-induced chemotaxis in sorted cells coexpressing beta ARKct was inhibited by 80%, demonstrating that chemotaxis was driven by a beta gamma-dependent pathway. However, no significant inhibition was observed in cells transfected with betaARKct but not enriched by sorting. Thus, we have developed a method for enriching transfected cells that allows the elucidation of crucial mechanisms of endothelial cell activation and function. This method should find wide applicability in studies designed to define pathways responsible for regulation of motility and other functions in these dynamic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2006579698,"Signaling pathways involving the inositol polyphosphates and the polyphosphoinositides have become intricately linked with a number of disease states. More recently, this has principally involved the 3-phosphorylated products of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, an enzyme that itself shows oncogenic activity and has hence become of interest in the design of antitumorigenic drugs. The downstream effectors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase are involved in different aspects of cellular signaling and cytoskeleton and trafficking events that are linked to specific polyphosphoinositide binding properties of specific protein domains, which themselves have emerging roles in specific disease states. Our recent findings have demonstrated that there is a selectivity of the intracellular effects of extracellularly applied inositol polyphosphates in their abilities to inhibit a range of growth-related in vivo assay conditions, and that these can themselves be linked to the inhibition of the membrane localization of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged PH domain. We propose that GFP fusions of the polyphosphoinositides binding domains of specific proteins of interest can be used in high-throughput investigations of the therapeutic value of specific inositol polyphosphates analogs. Inhibition of in vivo membrane targeting of these domains from proteins involved in cell growth and tumorigenesis can thus be used in the search for new anticancer drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2077247423,"Conventional qualitative approaches to signal transduction provide powerful ways to explore the architecture and function of signaling pathways. However, at the level of the complete system, they do not fully depict the interactions between signaling and metabolic pathways and fail to give a manageable overview of the complexity that is often a feature of cellular signal transduction. Here, we introduce a quantitative experimental approach to signal transduction that helps to overcome these difficulties. We present a quantitative analysis of signal transduction during early mitogen stimulation of lymphocytes, with steady-state respiration rate as a convenient marker of metabolic stimulation. First, by inhibiting various key signaling pathways, we measure their relative importance in regulating respiration. About 80% of the input signal is conveyed via identifiable routes: 50% through pathways sensitive to inhibitors of protein kinase C and MAP kinase and 30% through pathways sensitive to an inhibitor of calcineurin. Second, we quantify how each of these pathways differentially stimulates functional units of reactions that produce and consume a key intermediate in respiration: the mitochondrial membrane potential. Both the PKC and calcineurin routes stimulate consumption more strongly than production, whereas the unidentified signaling routes stimulate production more than consumption, leading to no change in membrane potential despite increased respiration rate. The approach allows a quantitative description of the relative importance of signal transduction pathways and the routes by which they activate a specific cellular process. It should be widely applicable."
https://openalex.org/W4237045660,"R-flurbiprofen is considered the 'inactive' isomer of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), flurbiprofen, because it does not inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) activity. However, previous studies have revealed that it has antinociceptive and antitum or effects not due to epimerization to the cyclooxygenase-inhibiting S-isomer. Here, we show that R-flurbiprofen has additional anti-inflammatory activity comparable with that of dexamethasone in the zymosan-induced paw inflammation model in rats. Different criteria suggest that the observed effects are mediated at least in part through inhibition of NF-kB activation: R-flurbiprofen inhibited i) LPS-induced NF-kB DNA binding activity in RAW 264.7 macrophages, ii) translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-kB into the nucleus of these cells, and iii) zymosan-induced NF-kB-dependent gene transcription in the inflamed paw and spinal cord of rats. S-flurbiprofen produced similar effects but was less potent. In addition, R-flurbiprofen inhibited DNA binding activity of AP-1, another key regulatory transcription factor in inflammatory processes. Because R-flurbiprofen does not cause gastrointestinal mucosal damage or other side effects associated with long-term NSAID or glucocorticoid use, it might be a useful drug in inflammatory or other diseases in which increased or constitutive NF-kB and AP-1 activation are involved in the pathophysiological processes."
