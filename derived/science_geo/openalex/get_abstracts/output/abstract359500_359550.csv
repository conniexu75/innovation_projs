https://openalex.org/W2236082650,"The discovery of relatively simple peptide derivatives as substrates for proteolytic enzymes has introduced a new approach to the problem of the specifity of this group of hydrolytic enzymes. Although crystalline trypsin is known to catalyze the hydrolysis of internal peptide bonds of proteins, its action toward internal peptide bonds of synthetic substrates has been demonstrated for only one case. Since all other synthetic substrates for trypsin, described in the extensive work of Bergmann and coworkers, are amides of lysine and arginine derivatives and are split enzymatically into ammonia and the corresponding amino acid derivatives, the action of trypsin toward these substrates may be more adequately described as an amidase activity. In the course of an investigation of the inhibition of crystalline pancreatic proteolytic enzymes by specific low molecular weight compounds the discovery was made that crystalline trypsin is likewise a powerful catalyst for the hydrolysis of certain amino acid esters. The most specific substrates of this type are alpha-benzoyl-L-arginine methyl ester (BAME) and alpha-toluene-sulfonyl-L-arginine methyl ester (TSAME). It was also found that, contrary to previous reports, trypsin catalyzes the amide hydrolysis of alpha-toluenesulfonyl-L-arginamide and does so even more rapidly than it catalyzes the hydrolysis of the classical substrate, alpha-benzoyl-L-argininamide. The structural specificity of these esters for trypsin is approximately analogous to that of the corresponding amides, although a certain measure of cross-reactivity of one of these (BAME) with chymotrypsin exists. Both the esterase and amidase activities are apparently mediated by the same active surface configurations of the enzyme, as is evidenced by studies of various modes of partial and complete enzyme inactivatiopn. The results of these kinetic studies are presented in this article."

The yeast DNA damage checkpoint clamp Ddc1-Mec3-Rad17 (human Rad9-Hus1-Rad1: 9-1-1) is loaded around effector DNA and thereby activates Mec1 kinase. Dpb11 (Schizosaccharomyces pombe Cut5/Rad4 or human TopBP1) is an essential protein required for the initiation of DNA replication and has a role in checkpoint activation. In this study, we demonstrate that Dpb11 directly activates the Mec1 kinase in phosphorylating the downstream effector kinase Rad53 (human Chk1/2) and DNA bound RPA. However, DNA was not required for Dpb11 to function as an activator. Dpb11 and yeast 9-1-1 independently activate Mec1, but substantial synergism in activation was observed when both activators were present. Our studies suggest that Dpb11 and 9-1-1 may partially compensate for each other during yeast checkpoint function.

The Ddc2 (human ATRIP) subunit of the heterodimeric Mec1-Ddc2 complex protein is required for association of Mec1 with single-stranded DNA coated with the single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA (4Rouse J.

Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar).DNA damage is also recognized by another group of sensor proteins called the checkpoint clamp-clamp loader complex (reviewed in Refs. 6Parrilla-Castellar E.R.

Biol. 2004; 78: 227-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The yeast 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp is a heterotrimer of the Ddc1, Rad17, and Mec3 proteins and is structurally similar to the replication clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen. The yeast clamp loader for 9-1-1 is Rad24-RFC, and it consists of the four small subunits of replication factor C (Rfc2-5) together with the Rad24 subunit, the ortholog of Rad17 in S. pombe and human. The checkpoint clamp and clamp loader are required for the DNA damage checkpoint. During the G1 phase of the cell cycle, RPA-coated ssDNA gaps that are generated during repair of DNA damage, e.g. by the nucleotide excision repair machinery, serve as a loading site for both the 9-1-1 clamp and Mec1 (8Giannattasio M. Lazzaro F. Longhese M.P. Plevani P. MuziFalconi M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We have recently reconstituted this checkpoint machinery in vitro with purified proteins (9Majka J. Niedziela-Majka A. Burgers P.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A partial duplex DNA with a 5′-primer-template junction and with the ssDNA region coated with RPA forms an efficient substrate for the loading of 9-1-1 by Rad24-RFC in an ATP-dependent reaction (10Majka J. Binz S.K. Wold M.S. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27855-27861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This complex specifically activates Mec1 to phosphorylate its downstream targets. Among these targets are the Rpa1 and Rpa2 subunits of RPA, the Rad24 subunit of the clamp loader, and the Ddc1 and Mec3 subunits of the clamp. The effector kinase Rad53 is also efficiently phosphorylated by the activated form of Mec1.Our in vitro studies are supported by cellular studies of the phosphorylation cascades put into effect by DNA damage and 9-1-1-promoted activation of Mec1 (9Majka J. Niedziela-Majka A. Burgers P.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 11Majka J. Burgers P.M. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 1157-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The Rad53 and Mec1 kinases also function to stabilize stalled replication forks in response to hydroxyurea-mediated nucleotide depletion (12Tercero J.A. Longhese M.P. Diffley J.F. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1323-1336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). However, based upon the analysis of yeast cells arrested with hydroxyurea, the participation of 9-1-1 in the DNA replication checkpoint appears to be of minor importance (13Longhese M.P. Clerici M. Lucchini G. Mutat. Res. 2003; 532: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).S. cerevisiae Dpb11 is an essential protein with a critical role in replisome assembly. The BRCT repeats in Dpb11 interact with the Sld2 and Sld3 initiator proteins that have been phosphorylated by the S phase CDK-cyclin complex, and this interaction is a crucial step in the initiation of DNA replication (14Zegerman P. Diffley J.F. Nature. 2007; 445: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 15Tanaka S. Umemori T. Hirai K. Muramatsu S. Kamimura Y. Araki H. Nature. 2007; 445: 328-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Dpb11 was first identified as a multicopy suppressor of conditional lethal mutations in DNA polymerase ϵ (16Araki H. Leem S.H. Phongdara A. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11791-11795Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The association of Dpb11 and DNA polymerase ϵ with the pre-replicative complex shows a mutual dependence (17Masumoto H. Sugino A. Araki H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2809-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Proteins involved in DNA replication can also function in the DNA replication checkpoint (13Longhese M.P. Clerici M. Lucchini G. Mutat. Res. 2003; 532: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Among those are Dpb11, DNA polymerase ϵ, the Sgs1 helicase, Tof1, and Mrc1 (16Araki H. Leem S.H. Phongdara A. Sugino A. Proc.

The Dpb11 homolog in S. pombe is Cut5/Rad4, and in human and Xenopus it is TopBP1, and these essential proteins also function in DNA replication and the replication checkpoint (22Saka Y. Fantes P.

Phosphorylation of a Ser/Thr residue in the C-terminal tail of Ddc1 is critical for this interaction (26Wang H. Elledge S.J. Genetics. 2002; 160: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Furuya K.

In S. pombe and higher eukaryotes, one function of 9-1-1 appears to be the recruitment of Cut5/TopBP1 to stalled replication forks, with subsequent activation of ATR by TopBP1. In vitro studies with purified Xenopus TopBP1 and immunoprecipitated ATR show that TopBP1 can directly activate ATR without the necessity of DNA or RPA (31Kumagai A. Lee J. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2006; 124: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). However, another report notes that the presence of DNA further stimulates the activation of human ATR by TopBP1 (32Choi J.H. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 13301-13306Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Activation ATR by human TopBP1 is mediated by interactions with both ATR and ATRIP, the regulatory subunit of ATR (33Mordes D.A. Glick G.G. Zhao R. Cortez D. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1478-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar).In S. cerevisiae, the 9-1-1 clamp loaded onto DNA directly activates the Mec1 kinase, without a requirement for Dpb11, an activity not yet observed in other model systems (9Majka J. Niedziela-Majka A. Burgers P.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). To understand whether checkpoint initiation in S. cerevisiae is fundamentally different from that in other organisms, we asked whether yeast Dpb11 is capable of activating the Mec1 kinase in vitro, and if so, whether it functions together with the 9-1-1 clamp. Here we show that Dpb11 is able to activate Mec1 independent of 9-1-1, and full activation of Mec1 by Dpb11 is comparable with that by the 9-1-1 clamp. However, at subsaturating concentrations of Dpb11 and 9-1-1, we observe a significant synergism between Dpb11 and 9-1-1 indicating that these factors may act together to accomplish a more robust activation of Mec1. Activation is abolished by mutations in the C-terminal tail of Dpb11.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and DNA Substrates—The DPB11 gene was cloned in a multicopy yeast shuttle vector pRS426-GALGST (2 μm origin, URA3, GAL1-10) and named pBL512. The glutathione S-transferase gene (GST) is separated from the N terminus of Dpb11 by a rhinoviral 3C protease cleavage site. A stop codon was generated by site-directed mutagenesis in pBL512 at position 572 to generate pBL512-571 (1-571 amino acids). Plasmids and their sequences are available upon request. Deca-primed ssDNA was made by annealing single-stranded bluescript SKII+ DNA with 10 28-mer primers spaced approximately equally around the ssDNA.Proteins—Mec1-Ddc2, Rad53-kd, RPA, Rad24-RFC, and Rad17-Mec3-Ddc1 (yeast 9-1-1) were purified as described earlier (9Majka J. Niedziela-Majka A. Burgers P.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 34Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). To make GST-Dpb11, pBL512 was transformed in yeast strain BJ2168 (MATa: ura3-52, trp1-298, leu2-3, 112, prb1-1122, prc1-407, pep4-3). Cells were grown and induced as described (35Bylund G.O. Majka J. Burgers P.M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Yeast cells (50 g) were blended in dry ice, followed by nucleic acid precipitation and ammonium sulfate fractionation, and purified over 1 ml of glutathione-Sepharose as described (35Bylund G.O. Majka J. Burgers P.M. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 409: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The GST-Dpb11 preparation was treated with 20 units of 3C protease overnight at 4 °C. Dpb11 was further purified over a 1-ml heparin-agarose column (GE Healthcare) in buffer A100 (buffer A0 = 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 10! glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01! Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μm pepstatin A, 2 μm leupeptin, 10 mm NaHSO3, 1 mm benzamidine; the subscript refers to mm KCl in the buffer). GST and 3C protease do not bind to heparin-agarose. The column was washed with 10 ml of buffer A100, 10 ml of buffer A180, and Dpb11 was eluted with buffer A500. The truncated protein was purified in a similar way.Protein Phosphorylation Assays—Standard 20-μl phosphorylation assays contained 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.8, 8 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 125 mm NaCl, 100 μm unlabeled ATP, and 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Other components when added were 1 nm Deca-primed ssDNA, 150 nm RPA, 100 nm Rad53-kd. Concentrations of Dpb11 and Rad17/3/1, clamp loader when added are indicated in legends. Reactions were preheated for 1 min at 30 °C and initiated by the addition of 5 nm Mec1/Ddc2 kinase. After 10 min at 30 °C, or the indicated times, the assays were stopped with 5 μl of 5 × SDS-polyacrylamide gel loading dye. The samples were run on 10 or 12! SDS-PAGE, dried, and exposed to a phosphor screen (GE Healthcare). Protein phosphorylation was quantified using ImageQuant software.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDpb11 Directly Activates the Mec1/Ddc2 Kinase—Dpb11 was overproduced in yeast from a multicopy plasmid with the DPB11 gene placed under control of the galactose-inducible GAL1-10 promoter. A cleavable GST tag was added to aid in purification (see under “Experimental Procedures”). Following the glutathione-affinity column, the GST tag was proteolytically cleaved, and Dpb11 was further purified by heparin-agarose chromatography to more than 98! purity (Fig. 1A). Dpb11 was free of (contaminating) nuclease or protein kinase activity.We studied the effect of Dpb11 on Mec1 kinase activity. The phosphorylation of Rad53 by Mec1 is critical in initiating the checkpoint response. Rad53 is also a downstream effector kinase that can undergo autophosphorylation to activate its functions (36Gilbert C.S. Green C.M. Lowndes N.F. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 129-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 37Sweeney F.D. Yang F. Chi A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Durocher D. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1364-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To eliminate the Rad53 autophosphorylation activity that might complicate the analysis, we used its kinase-defective form Rad53-kd (Rad53K227A) as a phosphorylation substrate (9Majka J. Niedziela-Majka A. Burgers P.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The presence of Dpb11 caused a dramatic enhancement of the Mec1 kinase activity, and phosphorylated Rad53-kd was visible from as early as 1 min from the start of the reaction (Fig. 1B, upper panel). We also studied Mec1-catalyzed phosphorylation of human PHAS-I, a commonly used substrate for PIK-like kinases (38Lawrence J.C. Lin T.A. McMahon L.P. Choi K.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 279: 199-213PubMed Google Scholar), in the absence and presence of Dpb11. Dpb11 caused an approximate 20-fold activation of Mec1 in phosphorylating PHAS-I (Fig. 1B, lower panel). Thus, Dpb11 appears to function as a general activator of Mec1, analogous to our previous analysis of Mec1 activation by the S. cerevisiae 9-1-1 clamp, and to ATR activation by vertebrate TopBP1 (9Majka J. Niedziela-Majka A. Burgers P.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 31Kumagai A. Lee J. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2006; 124: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar).We also studied the phosphorylation of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA. In yeast, both the Rpa1 and Rpa2 subunits of RPA are phosphorylated by Mec1 in response to DNA damage (39Brush G.S. Kelly T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3725-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In vitro, these two RPA subunits are phosphorylated by Mec1; however, phosphorylation is greatly stimulated when the RPA is bound to ssDNA (40Kim H.S. Brill S.J. DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 1321-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 41Bartrand A.J. Iyasu D. Brush G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26762-26767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Addition of the 9-1-1 clamp loaded onto DNA stimulates the Mec1-mediated phosphorylation of DNA-bound RPA even further (9Majka J. Niedziela-Majka A. Burgers P.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In this study, a rather complex interaction between RPA and Mec1 or its Dpb11-activated form was delineated.First, we determined the rate of Rad53-kd phosphorylation by Mec1. In the absence of DNA, addition of increasing RPA caused a substantial inhibition of basal or Dpb11-activated Mec1 activity on Rad53-kd (Fig. 1C, lanes 1-6). This inhibition by RPA disappeared when DNA was also added to the assay. In fact, a small stimulation by RPA-coated ssDNA in comparison with the absence of both factors was consistently detected (Fig. 1C, compare lane 4 with 11 and 12). A similar phosphorylation pattern was observed with PHAS-I as target for Mec1 kinase (data not shown). A more detailed analysis of the role of DNA in Mec1 activation is presented below. Next, we determined the role of Dpb11 and DNA in RPA phosphorylation. In agreement with previous studies (9Majka J. Niedziela-Majka A. Burgers P.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 41Bartrand A.J. Iyasu D. Brush G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26762-26767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), only DNA-bound RPA is an efficient target for phosphorylation by Mec1 (Fig. 1C). In the absence of DNA and the presence of Dpb11, a weak phosphorylation of RPA was observed (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 6). Both the basal and Dpb11-activated phosphorylation of Rpa1 and Rpa2 were greatly enhanced when ssDNA was added to the assay (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 8 and 9 with 2 and 3 and lanes 11 and 12 with 5 and 6).Affinity of Mec1 for Dpb11 and for Phosphorylation Targets—Two additional parameters of the Dpb11-mediated stimulation of Mec1 were investigated. First, we used the activation assay to determine the strength of interaction between Dpb11 and Mec1. RPA-coated DNA and Rad53-kd were incubated with Mec1 and with increasing levels of Dpb11, from 0 to 20 nm, and phosphoproteins were quantified as a function of time (Fig. 2A). The rate curves allowed us to determine a Km value of ∼5 nm for Dpb11 (Fig. 2A, inset). Within error, the same Km value was determined regardless whether phosphorylation rates of Rpa1 or Rpa2 or of Rad53-kd were used for the Km calculation. Second, we titrated target proteins PHAS-I and Rad53-kd into the Dpb11-stimulated Mec1 phosphorylation assay to obtain an estimate of the affinity of these target proteins for Mec1. However, even at 4 μm PHAS-I or at 400 nm Rad53-kd, the highest levels of these proteins that were practically attainable, phosphate incorporation still increased linearly with target concentration making an estimate of the relative affinity of these proteins for activated Mec1 impossible (Fig. 2B). Thus, although the activator Dpb11 has a high affinity for Mec1, target proteins such as Rad53-kd and PHAS-I have a relatively low affinity. The same low affinity of activated Mec1 for its phosphorylation targets was previously obtained with the checkpoint clamp 9-1-1 as activator of Mec1 (9Majka J. Niedziela-Majka A. Burgers P.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In this study, Rad53-kd was routinely used at 100 nm.FIGURE 2Affinity of Mec1 for Dpb11 and targets. A, standard phosphorylation assays contained 1 nm deca-primed ssSK2 DNA, 150 nm RPA, and 5 nm Mec1 with the indicated concentrations of Dpb11. Aliquots were taken after the indicated times and analyzed by 10! SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation of Rpa2 was quantified and plotted. The inset shows the phosphorylation rate as a function of Dpb11 concentration. B, standard phosphorylation assays contained 5 nm Mec1 with or without 20 nm Dpb11 and increasing Rad53-kDa or PHAS-I. Assays were analyzed by 10! SDS-PAGE for Rad53-kd (top panel) and 12! SDS-PAGE for PHAS-I (bottom panel), quantified, and plotted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Role of DNA in Dpb11 Activation of Mec1—Under physiological salt conditions, i.e. ∼125 mm NaCl, the yeast 9-1-1 clamp only stimulates Mec1 when the clamp is loaded onto DNA by its clamp loader Rad24-RFC (9Majka J. Niedziela-Majka A. Burgers P.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, at low salt (∼40 mm NaCl), this specificity for a loaded clamp is relaxed, and some stimulation by the clamp alone can be observed. Although this type of stimulation without DNA at low salt has been useful for mechanistic studies, we think it has no physiological relevance (9Majka J. Niedziela-Majka A. Burgers P.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent studies of human TopBP1 indicate a similar type of stimulation pattern (32Choi J.H. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 13301-13306Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). At low salt, TopBP1 stimulated ATR without DNA present, whereas at higher salt, the presence of DNA aided in the TopBP1 stimulation of ATR. An even greater stimulation was observed when the DNA contained damage (32Choi J.H. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 13301-13306Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).We studied if the presence of DNA affected Dpb11 in its ability to activate Mec1, and the effect of salt on the potential for DNA stimulation. Initially, we used a 3-kb deca-primed single-stranded phagemid circle as effector DNA. Rad53-kd phosphorylation by Mec1 was monitored at increasing NaCl levels in the absence of Dpb11, in the presence of Dpb11, or Dpb11 with deca-primed single-stranded circular DNA. In the absence of Dpb11, weak Rad53-kd phosphorylation was observed at low salt conditions, and this diminished with increasing NaCl levels. Without DNA present, Dpb11 was able to efficiently activate Mec1 phosphorylation of Rad53kd at all salt levels (Fig. 3, A and B). In fact, at 150 mm NaCl, Mec1 kinase activity was completely dependent on Dpb11. The addition of DNA showed only a slight increase in Mec1 activation by Dpb11 at low NaCl concentrations, but this effect disappeared with increasing salt (Fig. 3B). We then tested if the presence of damaged DNA had an effect on Dpb11 activation of Mec1. We used two levels (1 and 5 μm nucleotide) of double-stranded supercoiled DNA or deca-primed ssDNA with or without prior irradiation with 1500 J/m2 of UV254. Both basal and Dpb11-stimulated Mec1 activity on Rad53 was largely unaffected by the presence of either single-stranded or double-stranded DNA with or without UV damage. The fold stimulation (±Dpb11) varied from 7- to 13-fold. The additional presence of RPA caused an approximate 2-fold inhibition in the absence of DNA, as shown before (Fig. 3C). However, in the presence of ssDNA, a low but significant ∼1.5-fold stimulation of Rad53-kd phosphorylation was observed. We conclude from these studies that RPA-coated ssDNA but not double-stranded DNA causes a minor stimulation of Dpb11-activated Mec1 activity regardless of damage. Whether this low stimulation occurs through binding of Mec1 to RPA-coated ssDNA (5Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2024) Google Scholar) or through the binding of other factors remains to be established.FIGURE 3Dpb11 activation of Mec1 is largely independent of DNA. A, Rad53-kd phosphorylation by Mec1 (5 nm) was determined at the indicated NaCl levels in the absence of Dpb11 (1st panel), with 5 nm Dpb11 (2nd panel), or with 5 nm Dpb11 and 15 μm (nucleotide) deca-primed single-stranded Bluescript DNA (3rd panel). B, Rad53-kd phosphorylation from A was quantified and plotted as a function of mm NaCl. C, Rad53-kd phosphorylation by Mec1 (5 nm) was determined at 80 mm NaCl in the absence of Dpb11 (1st panel), or with 5 nm Dpb11 (2nd panel), or with 5 nm Dpb11 and 150 nm RPA (3rd panel). Double-stranded or deca-primed single-stranded Bluescript DNA, with or without prior UV (1500 J/m2) treatment, was added as indicated. The phosphorylation signal ratios (2nd panel/1st panel) and (3rd panel/2nd panel) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Dpb11 C-terminal Tail Is Required for the Activation of Mec1 Kinase—The ATR activating domain lies between the sixth and seventh BRCT repeat in the C-terminal domain of vertebrate TopBP1 (31Kumagai A. Lee J. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2006; 124: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). There is no obvious similarity to this domain in S. cerevisiae Dpb11 or S. pombe Cut5. Dpb11 is a protein of 764 amino acids and has four BRCT repeats. A dpb11-1 mutant strain with a premature stop codon at amino acid 583 is temperature-sensitive for growth and checkpoint defective at the permissive temperature (16Araki H. Leem S.H. Phongdara A. Sugino A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11791-11795Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Therefore, in a preliminary analysis, we retained all the BRCT repeats and deleted the C-terminal end of the protein to generate Dpb11-(1-571). This truncated form of Dpb11 had lost its Mec1 activation ability. Either 20 nm wild-type or 20 nm Dpb11-(1-571) was added to the standard Mec1 stimulation assay that included Rad53-kd and RPA-coated deca-primed ssDNA (Fig. 4). Phosphorylation by Mec1 of the three target proteins in this assay, Rpa1, Rpa2, and Rad53-kd, was not stimulated by Dpb11-(1-571) compared with the control without Dpb11, indicating that this region of Dpb11 is essential for Mec1 activation.FIGURE 4The C-terminal tail of Dpb11 is required for stimulation.

In this study, we formed four dopamine modification adducts derived from docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6/ω-3) and arachidonic acid (C18:4/ω-6), which are known as the major polyunsaturated fatty acids in the brain. Upon incubation of dopamine with fatty acid hydroperoxides and an in vivo experiment using rat brain tissue, all four dopamine adducts were detected. Furthermore, hexanoyl dopamine (HED), an arachidonic acid-derived adduct, caused severe cytotoxicity in human dopaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, whereas the other adducts were only slightly affected. The HED-induced cell death was found to include apoptosis, which also seems to be mediated by reactive oxygen species generation and mitochondrial abnormality. Additionally, the experiments using monoamine transporter inhibitor and mouse embryonic fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells that lack the monoamine transporter indicate that the HED-induced cytotoxicity might specially occur in the neuronal cells. These data suggest that the formation of the docosahexaenoic acid- and arachidonic acid-derived dopamine adducts in vitro and in vivo, and HED, the arachidonic acid-derived dopamine modification adduct, which caused selective cytotoxicity of neuronal cells, may indicate a novel mechanism responsible for the pathogenesis in Parkinson disease.

Wichmann T. Clin. Neurophysiol. 2008; 119: 1459-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Until now, very little is known about why and how the PD neurodegenerative process begins and progresses; however, an increasing body of evidence suggests that oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and impairment of the ubiquitin-proteasome system may be involved in the pathogenesis of PD (2.Fahn S. Cohen G. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 32: 804-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar, 3.Leroy E. Boyer R. Auburger G. Leube B. Ulm G. Mezey E. Harta G. Brownstein M.J. Jonnalagada S. Chernova T.

Recent studies indicate that there are high levels of basal oxidative stress in the substantia nigra pars compacta in the normal brain, and this is increased in PD (6.Jenner P. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53: S26-S38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). Oxidative stress in the brain easily leads to the lipid peroxidation reaction because of a high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6/ω-3) and arachidonic acid (AA, C18:4/ω-6), which are present in the brain (7.Porter N.A. Caldwell S.E. Mills K.A. Lipids. 1995; 30: 277-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). The polyunsaturated fatty acids are located almost exclusively in the SN2 position of the phosphoglycerides found in the neural cell membranes. The beneficial physiological effects of DHA and AA have been frequently reported (8.Simopoulos A.P. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1999; 70: 560-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 9.Hadders-Algra M. J. Perinat. Med. 2008; 36: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar); however, the fatty acids are highly unsaturated, thus making them particularly susceptible to peroxidation. During the lipid peroxidation reaction, lipid hydroperoxides are generated as primary products. Subsequent decomposition leads to the formation of reactive mediates including aldehydes, which can covalently modify biomolecules. We have recently found that lipid hydroperoxides, the primary peroxidative products, can universally react with primary amino groups to form N-acyl-type (amide linkage) adducts (10.Kato Y. Makino Y. Osawa T. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1334-1346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Kato Y. Osawa T. Arch. Biochem.

Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1386-1398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, the formation of linoleic acid-derived lysine modification adducts, Nϵ-(hexanoyl) lysine and Nϵ-(azelayl) lysine, and DHA-derived adducts, Nϵ-(succinyl) lysine and Nϵ-(propanoyl) lysine, have been identified in vitro or in vivo by liquid chromatography-MS/MS or immunochemical analysis. In addition, the formation of Nϵ-(hexanoyl) lysine also was detected, as well as Nϵ-(glutaryl) lysine, during the reaction of oxidized AA with the lysine residue. The N-acyl-type adducts are specific to the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids; therefore, their formations are useful markers for the lipid peroxidation, protein modification, and related dysfunction that occur in these fatty acid-enriched tissues. Dopamine is the endogenous neurotransmitter produced by nigral neurons. Dopamine loss can trigger not only prominent secondary morphological changes, such as density reduction of the dendritic spines, but also changes in the density and sensitivity of dopamine receptors (1.Galvan A. Wichmann T. Clin. Neurophysiol. 2008; 119: 1459-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar); therefore, it is a sign of PD development. The reasons for dopamine loss are attributed to the molecular instability of dopamine. Some possible causes of dopamine loss are abnormalities of dopaminergic neurons (16.Bove J. Prou D. Perier C. Przedborski S. NeuroRx. 2005; 2: 484-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), dopamine degradation by monoamine oxidase A (17.Gotz M.E. Kunig G. Riederer P. Youdim M.B. Pharmacol. Ther. 1994; 63: 37-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) or auto-oxidation (18.Hald A. Lotharius J. Exp. Neurol. 2005; 193: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and the reaction with amino acid cysteine (19.LaVoie M.J. Hastings T.G. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2546-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Dopamine is a member of catecholamine family. The catechol structure contributes to high oxidative activation of dopamine. Additionally, the N termini in the structure of dopamine may represent another reactive spot; however, little experimental evidence proves this. Based on our previously described reaction between lipid hydroperoxides and N-terminal residues, we focused on the possibility that reactive hydroperoxide species derived from lipid peroxidation may modify dopamine to form amide linkage dopamine adducts. In the present study, we chemically synthesized four dopamine-modified adducts derived from DHA and AA. We were particularly interested in the formation of the dopamine adducts by chemical reactions and in vivo experiments, as well as the cytotoxicity evaluation using neuronal cells. All four dopamine adducts were detected upon incubation of dopamine with fatty acid hydroperoxides and an in vivo experiment using rat brain tissue. Furthermore, we focused on an AA-derived adduct HED, which induced severe cytotoxicity in human dopaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells compared with other adducts. The HED-induced cell death was found to include apoptosis that might be mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial abnormality in SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, we found that the presence of monoamine transporters in the cells was essential for the HED-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting the specificity of the cytotoxicity to the cells. Taken together, the DHA- and AA-derived dopamine adducts may be useful biomarkers of the dopamine deficiency, and the formation of these adducts may indicate a novel mechanism responsible for the pathogenesis in Parkinson disease. Materials—DHA, arachidonic acid, lipoxidase, GBR 12909 dihydrochloride, imipramine hydrochloride, N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Aal-Asp-al, and RNase were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Tokyo, Japan). Dopamine·HCl was purchased from Nacalai Tesque, Inc. (Kyoto, Japan). Linoleic acid, hexanoic anhydride, glutaric anhydride, propanoic anhydride, succinic anhydride, lauric anhydride, and nonanoic anhydride were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). The antibodies against cytochrome c oxidase IV and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Boston, MA). Active caspase-3 rabbit monoclonal antibody was purchased from Epitomics, Inc. (Burlingane, CA). Synthesis of N-Acyl Dopamine Adducts—The N-acyl dopamine adducts were chemically synthesized by incubating dopamine (0.5 mm) with carboxylic or methylic anhydride (0.5 mm) in 5 ml of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4)-saturated sodium acetate (1:1, v/v) for 60 min at room temperature. Succinic anhydride and propanoic anhydride were utilized for preparing the succinyl dopamine (SUD) and propanoyl dopamine (PRD), respectively; Hexanoic anhydride and glutaric anhydride were used for synthesizing the HED and glutaroyl dopamine (GLD), respectively. The synthesized adducts were purified by reverse phase HPLC using a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (20 × 250 mm) in an isocratic system of 15 or 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at the flow rate of 6 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. The amino residues in the dopamine adducts were identified by the ninhydrin reaction. The mass, structure, and formula of the synthesized molecule were identified by HPLC-MS, NMR, and electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analyses, respectively. HPLC-Tandem Mass Spectrometry—The HPLC-MS/MS analysis was carried out using an API 2000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) through a TurboIonSpray source. Chromatography was carried out on a Develosil ODS-HG-3 column (2.0 × 250 mm) using an Agilent 1100 HPLC system. The chromatographic separation was performed by a gradient elution as follows: 0–10 min, linear gradient from 0.1% formic acid to 50% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid; 10–15 min, hold; 15–20 min, linear gradient to 0.1% formic acid; flow rate = 0.2 ml/min. The instrument response was optimized by infusion experiments with the standard compounds using a syringe pump at the flow rate of 5 μl/min. The dopamine adducts were detected using electrospray ionization MS/MS in the multiple reaction monitoring mode. In Vitro Modification of Dopamine—DHA hydroperoxides were prepared from the DHA auto-oxidative reaction, and AA hydroperoxides were prepared using 15-lipoxygenase. The levels of lipid hydroperoxide were determined using a lipid hydroperoxide assay kit (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, Michigan). Dopamine (2 mm) was incubated with 10 mm of DHA or AA hydroperoxides in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C for different times. The reaction was terminated by immediate freezing at -80 °C. AA hydroperoxide was prepared as described previously (11.Kato Y. Osawa T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351: 106-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In Vivo Detection of Dopamine Adducts—Brain homogenates of 7- and 27-week-old male F344/NSIc rats were used to detect the dopamine adducts. Briefly, the rat brain was removed and homogenized with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% dibutylhydroxytoluene (5 mm) and EDTA (250 mm). After the addition of the deuterated dopamine adducts (20 μm) as the internal standard, the homogenates were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was then dissolved in 100 μl of methanol. The detection was carried out by HPLC-MS/MS. Cell Cultures and Drug Treatment Procedures—SH-SY5Y human dopaminergic neuroblastoma cells and NIH-3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cells were kindly donated by Dr. Maruyama (National Institute for Longevity Science). SH-SY5Y cells and NIH-3T3 cells were grown in Cosmedium-001 (Cosmo-Bio, Tokyo, Japan) containing 5% FBS and DMEM containing 10% FBS, respectively, and maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. The 80% confluent cells were allowed to medium change with FBS-free DMEM overnight. The dissolved drugs were diluted by 1/500 or 1/1000 and added to fresh FBS-free DMEM to achieve the required concentration. Assessment of Cell Viability—Cell viability was evaluated by an MTT assay. SH-SY5Y cells in 96-well plates were incubated with drugs for different times, followed by further incubation with 500 μg/ml MTT at 37 °C for 2 h. Cell viability in some experiments was also measured using PI and Hoechst 33258 staining. ROS Measurement—Endogenous ROS level was detected by flow cytometry using H2DCF-DA (2′,7′,-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate) (Molecular Probes). Briefly, the drug-treated cells were incubated with H2DCF-DA for 30 min, and the fluorescence of dichlorofluorescein (DCF) was measured using an EPICS Elite Flow Cytometer. DNA Fragmentation Assay—The drug-treated SH-SY5Y cells were collected, suspended in 0.2 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100), and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The samples were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant containing the DNA cleavage products was incubated with 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 1 h followed by 0.1 mg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 50 °C. The DNA fragments were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and then separated on an ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/ml)-containing 2% agarose gel. Subcellular Fraction of SH-SY5Y Cell—The cells are harvested by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended with 5 volumes of Solution A (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cellular suspension was homogenized with a glass-glass homogenizer with 20 up and down passes of the pestle. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 750 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was collected and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The pellet was used as the mitochondrial fraction. Western Blot Analysis—The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, and lysed with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After protein quantification, equal amounts of the protein (total protein, 20–50 μg) were boiled with Laemmli sample buffer for 5 min at 100 °C. The samples were run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, incubated with 5% skim milk in TTBS (Tris-buffered saline containing 10% Tween 20) for blocking, washed, and treated with the primary antibodies. After washing with TTBS, the blots were further incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the IgG antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase in TTBS. The blots were then washed three times in TTBS before visualization. An ECL kit was used for detection. Statistical Analysis—All of the data were analyzed using Bonferroni/Dunn's multiple comparison procedure. Chemical Formation of DHA- and AA-derived Dopamine Adducts—Based on the observations that lipid hydroperoxides, the primary products of lipid peroxidation, could universally react with primary amino groups to form N-acyl-type (amide linkage) adducts, and also within the chemical structure of dopamine, an amino residue is present, we chemically synthesized the four amide linkage dopamine adducts, SUD, PRD, HED, and GLD, that were derived from DHA and AA, respectively (Fig. 1A). The chemical structures of the authentic adducts were identified by NMR (supplemental Figs. S1–S4). The formation of these dopamine adducts was further confirmed by HPLC-MS/MS analysis. Collision-induced dissociation of the authentic adducts SUD (m/z 254), PRD (m/z 210), HED (m/z 252), and GLD (m/z 268) produced the same daughter ions at m/z 91 and 137. SUD, PRD, and HED also produced daughter ions at m/z 154, whereas GLD did not. These ions were assigned the structures shown in Fig. 1B. The ion at m/z 137 was detected with the highest peak intensity in the fragments, and this ion was also identified to be derived from the dopamine spectra. In Vitro Detection of Dopamine Adducts—To determinate the in vitro formation of the dopamine adducts, the reaction of dopamine with DHA or AA hydroperoxides were carried out. The reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS based on the information in the collision-induced dissociation spectra. As shown in Fig. 2, the peaks indicating SUD, PRD, HED, and GLD were successfully detected at m/z 254 → 137, m/z 210 → 137, m/z 252 → 137, and m/z 268 → 137, respectively. The retention times were consistent with those of the authentic adducts. In Vivo Detection of Dopamine Adducts—It has been reported that polyunsaturated fatty acids such as DHA and AA are significantly enriched in the brain (20.Tapiero H. Ba G.N. Couvreur P. Tew K.D. Biomed. Pharmacother. 2002; 56: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) and that there are high levels of basal oxidative stress in the normal brain, which increases with aging (21.Lin M.T. Flint B.M. Nature. 2006; 433: 787-795Crossref Scopus (4642) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the DHA- and AA-derived dopamine adducts can be formed in vivo, the brains of 7- and 27-week-old male F344/NSIc rats were removed, and the homogenates were used. The detection of the dopamine adducts in the homogenates was carried out by HPLC-MS/MS. The whole adducts were detected in the 7- and 27-week rat brains in both the positive ion mode and negative ion mode of liquid chromatography-MS/MS (data not shown). The level of adduct formation was shown in Fig. 3. The HED and PRD, which are derived from the C terminus of AA and DHA, were more significantly formed than SUD and PRD; however, no significant difference of adduct level was found between the 7- and 27-week-old rats. Identification of HED as a Potent Inducer of Neuronal Apoptosis—In recent years, several dopamine oxidants and dopamine-modified adducts have been reported, such as neuromelanin (22.Wakamatsu K. Fujikawa K. Zucca F.A. Zecca L. Ito S. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1015-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), aminochrome (23.Graumann R. Paris I. Martinez-Alvarado P. Rumanque P.

Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2546-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), in which 6-OHDA has been generally known as a potent neurotoxin (25.Pezzella A. d'Ischia M. Napolitano A. Misuraca G.

We hypothesized that some of these DHA- and AA-derived dopamine adducts could cause neuronal cell death. To test this hypothesis, the effect of these dopamine adducts on the cell viability in SH-SY5Y cells was studied. After treatment with 100 μm of the sample for 24 h, among the tested dopamine adducts, HED and PRD induced about 80 and 30% of the cell death, respectively. On the other hand, SUD and GLD had almost no influence on the cell viability (Fig. 4A), suggesting that the death of SH-SY5Y cells was induced only by the C terminus-derived adducts and not by the C terminus-derived adducts. Of interest, two HED analogs, nonanoyl dopamine (NOD) and lauroyl dopamine (LAD), which were synthesized in this study and characterized by more carbons than HED in the methyl terminus, also showed a significant toxicity to SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the number of carbons in the C terminus-derived dopamine adducts might be associated with the adduct-induced cell death. Remarkably, HED was a potent inducer of SH-SY5Y cell death compared with SUD, PRD, and GLD. Because the main cause of neuronal cell death has been postulated to be apoptosis, we then characterized whether HED-induced cell death in SH-SY5Y cells includes apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 5A, the exposure to HED led to a dose-dependent decrease in the viable cells. When the SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to 10 μm HED for 4 h, the fragmented nuclei were found in cells exhibiting the typical morphological features of apoptosis (Fig. 5B). In addition, the gel electrophoresis of DNA from the SH-SY5Y cells exposed to HED also displayed nucleosomal DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5C). HED treatment also led to the time- and dose-dependent cleavage of PARP, resulting in the accumulation of the 85-kDa fragment and decreasing in the 116-kDa protein, as well as in the accumulation of the active caspase-3 (Fig. 5D), both of which are hallmarks of apoptosis. Moreover, the pretreatment with the caspase-3 inhibitor significantly prevented SH-SY5Y cells from HED-induced DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5E), providing further evidence that HED induced a caspase-3-mediated apoptotic cell death. Regulation of HED-induced Apoptosis in SH-SY5Y Cells—We next investigated the signaling mechanism underlying the HED-induced apoptosis. It is well accepted that ROS generation is a key contributor to neuronal apoptosis induced by neurotoxin compounds (28.Chinopoulos C. Adam-Vizi V. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 433-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Hence, experiments were first carried out to assess ROS generation induced by the HED treatment and the possibility that the HED-induced apoptosis is mediated via ROS generation in SH-SY5Y cells. As shown in Fig. 6A, HED led to about a 3.5-fold increased ROS generation in the cells compared with the Me2SO-treated cells, whereas the other three dopamine adducts, SUD, PRD, and GLD, had much less of an effect on the cells. Furthermore, after the HED treatment for 30 min, a dose-dependent increase in ROS generation was found by DCF fluorescence staining (Fig. 6B). The pretreatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine, a potent antioxidant, clearly inhibited the PARP cleavage (Fig. 6C), indicating that ROS generation might be critically involved in the HED-induced apoptosis. It is widely accepted that mitochondrial dysfunction may play very important roles in neuronal cell death (29.Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Science. 1997; 275: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (4277) Google Scholar). Here, we examined cytochrome c release from mitochondria in the cells, which are an important feature of mitochondrial change and a potent inducer of caspase-3 activation. As shown in Fig. 6D, dose- and time-dependent decreases of cytochrome c expression in the mitochondrial fraction were obviously observed in HED-treated cells. Effect of Monoamine Transporter Inhibition on HED-induced Apoptosis and ROS Generation—Monoamine transporters including the dopamine transporter (DAT), norepinephrine transporter (NET), and 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), which are of fundamental importance for proper signaling between neurons, have been reported to associate with experimental neurotoxins-induced toxicity (30.Kita T. Wagner G.C. Nakashima T. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 92: 178-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). HED possesses a dopamine-based chemical structure; therefore, in this study we hypothesized that the above-described HED cytotoxicity that occurred in the SH-SY5Y cells might be mediated by some monoamine transporters. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used the monoamine transporter inhibitor to investigate the effect of DAT, NET, and 5-HTT on HED-induced apoptosis and ROS generation. As shown in Fig. 7A, the pretreatment with both GBR12909 and imipramine, the inhibitors of DAT and NET/5-HHT, respectively, clearly inhibited the occurrence of the HED-induced PARP cleavage and active caspase-3 expression in the SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, ROS generation by HED was also found to be suppressed in these two inhibitor-pretreated cells. The result that both monoamine transporter inhibitors showed markedly inhibitive effect on the HED-induced apoptosis and ROS generation suggested that HED might be primarily transported into the SH-SY5Y cells by the monoamine transporters and inflicted damage on the cells. Influence of HED to NIH-3T3 Cell Lines—To characterize whether the HED-induced cytotoxicity is specific to neuronal cells, we investigated the effect of HED on apoptotic cell death and ROS generation in mouse embryonic fibroblast NIH-3T3 cells in comparison with that of the SH-SY5Y cells. A dose-dependent analysis revealed that HED led to no apoptotic cell death in the NIH-3T3 cells based on Hoechst 33258 and PI nuclear staining (Fig. 8A). A further quantitative analysis of the apoptotic cells by flow cytometry also indicated a significant apoptosis in SH-SY5Y cells, whereas not in the NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 8B). Moreover, no ROS generation was found in the HED-treated NIH-3T3 cells; on the other hand, the HED analogs, NOD and LAD, also induced only a slight ROS generation in the NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 8C). These data and the fact that monoamine transporter is absent in NIH-3T3 cells suggest that the HED-induced cytotoxicity might be specific to neuronal cells. The nervous system is particularly vulnerable to the deleterious effect of ROS, and one of the main reasons is that the brain contains high concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acid that are highly susceptible to lipid peroxidation (31.Mariani E. Polidori M.C. Cherubini A. Mecocci P. J. Chromatogr. B. 2005; 827: 65-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar, 32.Liu X.B. Shibata T. Hisaka S. Osawa T. J. Clin. Biochem. Nutr. 2008; 43: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In recent years, an increasing body of evidence suggests that oxidative stress is pathologically involved in neurodegenerative disorders (33.Zecca L. Youdim M.B.H. Riederer P. Connor J.R. Crichton R.R. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 863-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar) including PD and Alzheimer disease. It is also generally accepted that lipid peroxidation, a central feature of oxidative stress, is an important reaction leading to oxidative damage in biomolecules, such as DNA and proteins (34.Shibata T.

https://openalex.org/W1983316896,"Dermatomyositis (DM) is an autoimmune disease, which is often accompanied by the development of disease-specific autoantibodies directed against the SNF2-superfamily helicase, Mi-2. Recent evidence suggests that ultraviolet radiation exposure may be an important risk factor for the development of not only the disease but also specific autoimmunity against Mi-2. Consequently, we investigated the effects of ultraviolet radiation on Mi-2 protein expression. We observed an increase in protein levels upon ultraviolet radiation exposure in cell culture systems. These changes in expression occur quite rapidly, are maximized just 1 h following exposure, and are unique to Mi-2 when compared with other members of the NuRD complex. Changes in protein levels are not mediated through transcriptional mechanisms. Treatment results in a more efficiently translated message through regulatory elements in the 5′-UTR region of the transcript. Investigation into protein half-life further demonstrated increased stability of Mi-2 following UV exposure. Taken together, we describe a system by which Mi-2 protein expression can be quickly increased following UV exposure and then maintained up to 16 h later. These data provide a novel regulation of an important transcriptional regulator and provide insight into the possible mechanisms of the development of DM and associated autoantibodies.

The β (CHD4) isoform is typically expressed at higher levels in vivo (6.Kim J. Sif S. Jones B. Jackson A. Koipally J. Heller E. Winandy S. Viel A. Sawyer A. Ikeda T. Kingston R. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In addition to the core Mi-2 ATPase, the NuRD complex contains histone deacetylases (HDAC) 1 and 2, retinoblastoma-binding proteins 46 and 48, metastasis-associated proteins (MTA1–3), and methyl CpG binding domain (MBD) proteins (7.Denslow S.A. Wade P.A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5433-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Together, the complex is often linked with transcriptional repression associated with the histone deacetylase activity and the intrinsic nucleosome remodeling activity of Mi-2 (7.Denslow S.A. Wade P.A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5433-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). However, other functions of NuRD including transcriptional activation, transcriptional termination, and centrosome maintenance have been suggested (8.Saether T. Berge T. Ledsaak M. Matre V.

Most notably, breast cancer expression patterns of the MTA subunits are prognostic indicators of metastasis and outcome (12.Kumar R. Wang R.A. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Semin Oncol. 2003; 30: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). DM is a form of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM), strongly associated with the development of Mi-2 autoantibodies. Like other IIMs, DM patients demonstrate signs of systemic inflammation and muscle weakness (13.Callen J.P. Wortmann R.L. Clin. Dermatol. 2006; 24: 363-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 14.Suber T.L. Casciola-Rosen L. Rosen A. Nat. Clin. Pract. Rheumatol. 2008; 4: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). IIM patients also are at increased risk for the development of cancer, arthritis, and interstitial lung disease (15.Schnabel A. Hellmich B. Gross W.L. Curr. Rheumatol. Rep. 2005; 7: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16.Levine S.M. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 2006; 18: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). DM is distinguishable from polymyositis (PM) and other IIMs by the occurrence of photosensitive skin rashes (13.Callen J.P. Wortmann R.L. Clin. Dermatol. 2006; 24: 363-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These rashes are hypothesized to occur in response to localized autoimmune reactions. Interestingly, 97% of IIM patients that present with antibodies to Mi-2 are eventually diagnosed with DM, suggesting an underlying mechanism unique to this form of the disease (17.Roux S. Seelig H.P. Meyer O. J. Rheumatol. 1998; 25: 395-396PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation may be an important risk factor for the disease as well as development of Mi-2 autoimmunity (18.Okada S. Weatherhead E. Targoff I.N. Wesley R. Miller F.W. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 2285-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A study investigating global surface UV intensity and the development of DM showed a statistically significant association of UV intensity with the frequency of disease (18.Okada S. Weatherhead E. Targoff I.N. Wesley R. Miller F.W. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 2285-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Even more interesting was a similar relationship between UV intensity and DM patients expressing Mi-2 autoantibodies. Because UV exposure induces a number of immunomodulatory effects and has been shown to contribute to autoimmunity, we investigated a possible role of UV regulation in Mi-2 protein in the skin that may contribute to the development of specific autoimmunity in DM patients. We demonstrate that in a keratinocyte cell culture system, UV exposure increases the expression of Mi-2 protein. These changes occur rapidly and seem to be unique to Mi-2 when compared with other NuRD complex members. We further identify the mechanisms by which Mi-2 protein is regulated following UV exposure. We demonstrate that Mi-2 message is translated at an increased rate following exposure to UV initiating rapid changes in protein levels detectable within 1 h of treatment. Furthermore, Mi-2 protein is stabilized allowing for the increased Mi-2 expression to be maintained up to 16 h. These findings highlight an important regulatory element of Mi-2 and possibly the NuRD complex that may also have implications for the development of immune responses to Mi-2 and ultimately DM. Cell Culture and Plasmids—The human keratinocyte cell lines 1106 and 1102 were obtained from ATCC. Cells were grown in Keratinocyte-SFM (Invitrogen) media containing 50 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract (Invitrogen), 35 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen), and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen). The MCF7, C33a, HEK-293, and Hela were obtained from ATCC and cultured in DMEM cell lines containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cell lines UL3 and NHF have been previously described (19.Fryer C.J.

The untranslated region (UTR) of Mi-2β (Refseq: NM_001273) was amplified using PCR with primers containing the restriction sites for BamHI (5′-UTR) or NheI (3′-UTR). The resulting PCR product was digested with the corresponding restriction endonuclease and inserted into the BamHI or SpeI sites of pMir-Report (Ambion). Sequences were verified by sequencing at the NIEHS sequencing core using Big Dye terminator kit (Applied Biosystems). pRL-CMV was acquired from Promega Corporation. Immunodetection—Keratinocytes plated on 10-cm2 dishes overnight were treated with UV radiation with a Tyler Research UV irradiator emitting a narrow 313-nm output at roughly 15 J/m2·s or ionizing radiation with the NIEHS 137Cs irradiator. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCL, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 400 mm NaCl) and total protein quantified using the Bio-Rad Protein assay. Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies. The antibodies directed against Mi-2, MTA2, and MTA3 were generous gifts of Dr. Paul Wade (NIEHS). The Mi-2 antibody is directed against a ∼700-amino acid region of Mi-2α, but recognizes both isoforms. We also utilized the following commercial antibodies: Mi-2β (Abcam, 54603), Mi-2α (Transduction Laboratories, C25020), MBD2 (Abcam, 38646), HDAC1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7872), HDAC2 (Abcam, 16032), Cox-2 (Cayman Chemical, 160112), cyclin A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-239), and β-actin (Abcam, 20272). Cells were treated with 2.5 μg/ml of actinomycin D or 1 μm MG132 as indicated. FACS Analysis—Keratinocytes were treated with UV irradiation as described above, and cells harvested at the indicated time points by trypsinization and centrifugation. Cells were then resuspended in PBS and fixed by slow addition of cold ethanol. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in PBS containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 40 μg/ml RNase A. Cells were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACSort flow cytometer. Immunocytochemistry—Keratinocytes were seeded onto coverslips overnight and then irradiated with 90 J/m2 UV radiation. At the indicated timepoints, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde. Following extensive PBS washes, cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min. DNA was then denatured by incubating cells in 2 m HCL for 30 min. Cells were extensively washed in PBS and blocked in PBS containing 20% goat serum at 37 °C. Samples were then incubated in 5% goat serum with antibodies directed against cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) (Medical and Biological Laboratories, D194) and Mi-2 (Wade Lab, NIEHS). Specific staining was detected by secondary labeling using Alexa-fluor 555 anti-rabbit antibody and Alexa-fluor 488 anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes). RT-PCR—Keratinocytes were plated and treated with 90 J/m2 UV radiation as described above. At the indicated time points, total RNA was harvested from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's protocol. RNA from luciferase experiments was further purified by DNase I treatment followed by purification with Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen) to ensure no plasmid contamination. cDNA was generated using the Superscript III qRT-PCR reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). Quantitative PCR was performed utilizing Sybr green detection of specific PCR products for the indicated targets. Primer sequences are identified in supplemental Table S1. Reporter Assays—Keratinocytes were plated in 6-well dishes and transfected with 0.1 μg of pRL-CMV and 0.3 μg of the indicated reporter vector using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) per manufacturer's protocol. Cells were treated with 90 J/m2 UV radiation and harvested 2 h post-treatment. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using Dual Luciferase kit (Promega). Metabolic Labeling—MCF7 cells were incubated with methionine-free DMEM for 2 h followed by treatment with 90 J/m2 UV radiation. Immediately following UV treatment, cells were incubated in DMEM containing 100 uCi/ml [35S]methionine for 2 h. Thereafter, cell lysates were harvested in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) and immunoprecipitated using Mi-2 specific antibodies or nonspecific antibodies purified from rabbit serum. Immunoprecipitated complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Storm Phosphorimager (GE Healthcare). UV Radiation Regulates Mi-2 Expression in Human Keratinocytes—Mi-2 was first identified as an autoantigen in patients suffering from DM, a disease characterized by photosensitive skin rashes. Global epidemiological studies suggest that UV exposure increases the risk for development of DM as well as Mi-2-specific autoantibodies (18.Okada S. Weatherhead E. Targoff I.N. Wesley R. Miller F.W. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 2285-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We hypothesized a relationship between UV radiation and the regulation of the Mi-2 protein in the cellular context of these photosensitive rashes. We utilized a human keratinocyte cell line (1106) derived from neonatal keratinocytes immortalized with the human papilloma virus. Interestingly, cells treated with an increasing dose (0–195 J/m2) of UV radiation demonstrate a subsequent increase in total Mi-2 protein expression 8 h after treatment (Fig. 1A, top panel). This regulation appears to be maximized at 45 J/m2 with higher doses having no additional effects. The effects are seen on both isoforms of Mi-2, although the strongest effect is seen in Mi-2α. As Mi-2 is the core subunit of NuRD chromatin remodeling complex, we investigated whether UV radiation also affected the other members of the complex. However, other NuRD complex proteins did not show similar up-regulation in protein expression with the exception of MBD2, which showed a modest increase in protein levels at the higher UV doses. The NuRD complex member, MTA1, had no detectable expression in the 1106 keratinocyte cell line. Cox-2 protein expression, which is known to be increased following UV exposure, was also analyzed as a positive control. Interestingly, the Cox-2 response occurs at higher doses than the 45 J/m2 required to induce Mi-2, suggesting that the Mi-2 pathway harbors a greater UV sensitivity. Because of a higher incidence of DM in females (21.Beeson P.B. Am. J. Med. 1994; 96: 457-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), we investigated a possible gender predisposition to these UV effects. We acquired another keratinocyte cell line (1102) and determined that it was derived from a female background by PCR of Y-chromosome-specific DNA (data not shown). The 1106 cell line was determined to be derived from a male (data not shown). However, treatment of the 1102 keratinocytes with UV radiation showed similar effects to that seen in the 1106 cell line (Fig. 1B) demonstrating that Mi-2 induction by UV is gender-independent. The other NuRD complex members behaved similarly in both cell lines. We further demonstrated this effect is not keratinocyte specific by treating the human breast cancer cell line, MCF7, with UV radiation and also observing increases in Mi-2 expression (Fig. 1C). As the NuRD complex regulation has been linked to the estrogen response in breast cancer (22.Fujita N. Kajita M. Taysavang P. Wade P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2004; 18: 2937-2949Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23.Dhasarathy A. Kajita M. Wade P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 2907-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), we also performed the experiment in MCF7 cells deprived of estrogen and saw identical results (supplemental Fig. S1A). To determine if this response is conserved, we investigated several other cells lines for changes in Mi-2 expression following UV exposure. The osteosarcoma cell line UL3, cervical cancer lines C33a and Hela, breast cancer cell line BT549, and normal human fibroblasts all demonstrated strong up-regulation of Mi-2 following UV exposure (supplemental Fig. S1B). The transformed fetal kidney line HEK-293 showed no change in Mi-2 expression (supplemental Fig. S1B). These data support a conserved, though not ubiquitous, model that Mi-2 protein levels increase following UV exposure. To address if these effects are specific for UV irradiation or a general response to DNA damage, cells were treated with increasing levels of ionizing radiation (0–5 grays). As seen with the UV treatments, Mi-2 protein expression increased following ionizing radiation implicating a mechanism initiated by general DNA damage (Fig. 1D). As DNA damage elicits a number of cellular processes from DNA repair to cell cycle arrest, each occurring over varying time courses, we performed a time course of Mi-2 induction in the keratinocyte cell line (1106). Keratinocytes were treated with 90 J/m2 UV radiation and cell lysates harvested at the indicated time points (Fig. 1E). Analysis of Mi-2 expression indicates a fairly rapid increase in protein levels seen within 30 min and maximized at 1 h after UV treatment. These changes are maintained up to 16 h following UV treatment. As DNA damage induces cell cycle checkpoints, we investigated if treatment with UV radiation had any affect on the cell cycle profile of keratinocytes. Cells were treated with 90 J/m2 of UV radiation, harvested at time points between 1 and 16 h, and subjected to propidium iodide flow cytometry analysis. In fact, UV radiation did initiate S-phase accumulation (Fig. 2A). However, these effects are not seen until 8 h after treatment, while the Mi-2 protein changes occur as early as ½ hour post-treatment (see Fig. 1E). At 1 h, when Mi-2 expression is maximized, there is no change in the cell cycle profile thus demonstrating that changes in Mi-2 expression are not a result of changes in the cell cycle. Additionally, we observed no accumulation of a sub-G0 population that is usually indicative of apoptosis. Mock treatment of samples also induced an increase in S phase at 8 and 16 h (supplemental Fig. S2). However, this increase is quite modest compared with the checkpoint created by UV exposure and is most likely caused by the addition of fresh media during mock treatment. To assess the severity of DNA damage accumulated over the time course of our experiments, we performed immunocytochemistry on keratinocytes treated with UV radiation. Damage induced by UV radiation was monitored with antibodies specific for CPDs. Intense staining of CPDs is observed 1 h following treatment and is maintained up to 16 h later (Fig. 2B), while little background staining is seen in the untreated cells. At the 16-h time point, the intensity of staining for CPDs is decreased indicating repair of many of the lesions, which, interestingly, may explain a slight increase in G2/M population by FACS (Fig. 2A). Co-staining for Mi-2 and CPDs in these samples shows no co-localization and implies that increased Mi-2 expression following DNA damage is not directly involved in repair of the lesions (Fig. 2B). Induction of Mi-2 following UV Is Not Regulated Transcriptionally—We have shown that Mi-2 protein expression is highly induced in less than 1 h following exposure to UV radiation. We addressed the mechanism of regulation by investigating the changes to Mi-2 mRNA levels following UV treatment by quantitative real time RT-PCR. Keratinocytes were irradiated with 90 J/m2 UV, and mRNA harvested at the indicated time points. Real-time RT-PCR analysis of the message corrected against GAPDH showed no significant changes in either Mi-2α or Mi-2β (Fig. 3A). Cox-2 (positive control) message was significantly increased over the time course, whereas CYPB1 (negative control) was unchanged following UV exposure. Interestingly, some members of the NuRD complex were significantly changed following UV exposure. Both MTA2 and MTA3 showed decreased mRNA expression 8 h after treatment, whereas MBD2, HDAC1, and HDAC2 showed modest but significant increases in message 16-h post UV. However, HDAC protein levels did not increase at either 8 h (Fig. 1, A and B) or 16 h (data not shown). The MBD2 protein did exhibit the aforementioned increase in protein expression. To further verify that the changes in Mi-2 protein following UV treatment are not regulated at the transcriptional level, keratinocytes were treated with the RNA polymerase II inhibitor actinomycin D following UV exposure. Cells treated with actinomycin D still showed induction of Mi-2 following UV treatment (data not shown). These data verify that changes in Mi-2 protein levels are not regulated at the transcriptional level. Mi-2 Is Regulated through Translational and Post-translation Mechanisms—Because the level of Mi-2 mRNA does not change following UV radiation, we investigated post-transcriptional mechanisms of Mi-2 induction. A number of proteins are stabilized following DNA damage as a mechanism to increase expression, most notably p53 and CHK2. Therefore, we investigated the ability of UV radiation to regulate Mi-2 expression by analyzing protein stability using the translational inhibitor cycloheximide. Keratinocytes were treated with 1 μm cycloheximide following exposure to 90 J/m2 UV radiation and lysates analyzed over a time course of 8 h. Interestingly, Mi-2 protein had a remarkably longer half-life following UV treatment (Fig. 4A) as compared with untreated cells. The increased stability becomes evident at 4-h post-treatment (compare lanes 3 and 8) and is still apparent at the 8-h time point. Interestingly, at 2-h post-treatment, no change in protein levels is noticeable. This is in contrast to the previously observed increased Mi-2 expression 30 min after UV exposure (Fig. 1D). Consequently the early rise in Mi-2 levels would not be accounted for by the stabilization of the protein. Taken together, these data suggest an alternate mechanism in the rapid accumulation of Mi-2 protein following UV exposure. To test if an alternate regulatory mechanism existed, Mi-2 protein was pharmacologically stabilized using the proteosome inhibitor MG132. Keratinocytes treated with MG132 following UV exposure still show increased Mi-2 expression (Fig. 4B, lanes 4–6) beyond the stabilization of the protein in the untreated sample. Cyclin A, a protein whose expression is regulated tightly by degradation, was utilized as a control for MG132 effectiveness and showed an increase in protein following MG132 treatment (Fig. 4B, compare lanes 1–3 to 4–6). Because stabilized protein does not account for the total increase in Mi-2 protein accumulation, we investigated changes in translational efficiency of the Mi-2 mRNA. There exist several well characterized mechanisms by which protein expression is regulated at the translational level, including systems that respond to DNA damage. Because previous work has linked DNA damage to regulation of translation through elements within the UTR of target proteins, we investigated a possible mechanism of Mi-2 regulation (24.Mazan-Mamczarz K. Galban S. Lopez de Silanes I. Martindale J.L. Atasoy U. Keene J.D. Gorospe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 25.Takagi M. Absalon M.J. McLure K.G. Kastan M.B. Cell. 2005; 123: 49-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Using the pMir-Report vector system we linked the UTRs of Mi-2β to the 5′- and 3′-ends of luciferase (Fig. 5A). Keratinocytes were then transfected with these constructs or the parental vector to determine if either UTR contains regulatory elements that respond to UV radiation. The reporter vector containing the 5′-UTR of Mi-2β showed a significant increase in luciferase activity (29.3%, p < 0.0001) just 2 h following UV treatment (Fig. 5B). In contrast, the parental vector and the reporter containing the 3′-UTR of Mi-2β showed no significant increase in luciferase activity, demonstrating that mRNA regulation is specific to the 5′-UTR. To verify that this increase in luciferase activity is not a result of transcriptional changes initiated after UV exposure, mRNA from cells transfected as in Fig. 5B was subjected to quantitative real-time RT-PCR. No significant increase in mRNA levels was observed in the UV treated cells for the 5′-UTR reporter (Fig. 5C). Finally, to verify that this regulatory mechanism in fact manipulates Mi-2 protein levels following UV radiation, we performed an in vivo labeling assay of newly translated protein. Unfortunately, keratinocyte cells reacted unfavorably to methionine-free media, so these experiments were performed in MCF7 cells that we have shown induce Mi-2 protein expression following UV radiation in a manner similar to keratinocytes (Fig. 1C). Cells were incubated in [35S]methionine containing media following treatment with or without 90 J/m2 UV radiation. Mi-2 protein from lysates was immunoprecipitated 2 h after irradiation and newly translated protein visualized by autoradiography. As expected, cells treated with UV radiation had a higher expression of labeled Mi-2 as compared with the mock-treated (Fig. 5C, compare lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, a nonspecific protein immunoprecipitated by IgG shows no change. These combined data suggest that a regulatory element within the 5′-UTR of Mi-2 increases translation leading to protein accumulation following UV treatment. In combination with increased stability, these mechanisms allow for a rapid increase in Mi-2 protein levels that are sustained hours after UV exposure (Fig. 1E). DM patients who suffer from photosensitive skin rashes have a propensity to develop autoantibodies against the Mi-2 subunit of NuRD complex (13.Callen J.P. Wortmann R.L. Clin. Dermatol. 2006; 24: 363-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Moreover, UV radiation exposure has been linked to an increased risk of developing DM and Mi-2 autoantibodies (18.Okada S. Weatherhead E. Targoff I.N. Wesley R. Miller F.W. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 2285-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Herein, we investigated the role of UV radiation on the regulation of Mi-2 protein. We demonstrate that keratinocytes respond to UV radiation by rapidly increasing Mi-2 protein levels. These changes in protein expression are not universal among other NuRD complex members. We further depict a model system for this regulation where Mi-2 message is translated more efficiently following UV treatment through a regulatory element within the 5′-UTR region of the mRNA. This mechanism allows for the rapid increase in protein that occurs within 30 min of treatment and is maximized at only 1-h post-UV. The elevated protein levels are maintained through another regulatory mechanism of protein stability. Together, these data suggest a model by which cells respond to UV exposure by quickly inducing Mi-2 protein expression, which can be sustained 16 h following this exposure. Mi-2 Regulation Is Post-transcriptional—We have demonstrated that Mi-2 protein is increased following exposure to UV and that this response is most likely a general response of DNA damage. The increases in protein level occur rapidly through changes in translational efficiency regulated, at least in part, through the 5′-UTR region of the Mi-2β message. Similar mechanisms have been described for the regulation of p53 protein following DNA damage. Regulatory elements in the p53 3′-UTR are regulated by human antigen R to control expression (24.Mazan-Mamczarz K. Galban S. Lopez de Silanes I. Martindale J.L. Atasoy U. Keene J.D. Gorospe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8354-8359Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Human antigen R binds to the mRNA following DNA damage and stimulates translation. However, not all translational mechanisms act through the 3′-UTR. Ribosomal protein L26 (RPL26) and Nucleolin have been shown to interact with the 5′-UTR of p53 and regulate translation, however, in opposite ways (25.Takagi M. Absalon M.J. McLure K.G. Kastan M.B. Cell. 2005; 123: 49-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Nucleolin inhibits translation in the absence of DNA damage while RPL26 increases translation upon DNA damage signaling. Thus, protein control mechanisms within the cell are in place to rapidly regulate protein levels without transcription of the possibly damaged genome. Interestingly, Mi-2 is regulated in this manner, yet does not have a known role in DNA damage repair. Our immunostaining further demonstrate that Mi-2 does not co-localize with sites of damage. However, there exist a number of other physiological responses such as cell cycle checkpoints that are initiated following damage as well as transcriptional regulation of important DNA damage response genes that may rely on Mi-2/NuRD. Functional Consequence of Mi-2 Induction—We have demonstrated conserved mechanism by which Mi-2 protein is increased rapidly following exposure to both UV and IR (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1B). Mi-2 is involved in transcriptional regulation through its association with the NuRD complex. In addition to the intrinsic ATPase chromatin remodeling activity of Mi-2, the NuRD complex contains HDACs and MBD proteins known to associate with methylated DNA (7.Denslow S.A. Wade P.A. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5433-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The NuRD complex is also known to associate with retinoblastoma-interacting proteins, which are generally considered molecular chaperones (26.Loyola A. Almouzni G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The NuRD complex has also been associated with other biological functions involved in regulating centrosome integrity, maintenance of chromatid cohesion, and transcriptional termination (9.Alen C. Kent N.A. Jones H.S. O'Sullivan J. Aranda A. Proudfoot N.J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1441-1452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 10.Hakimi M.A. Bochar D.A. Schmiesing J.A. Dong Y. Barak O.G. Speicher D.W. Yokomori K. Shiekhattar R. Nature. 2002; 418: 994-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 11.Sillibourne J.E. Delaval B. Redick S. Sinha M. Doxsey S.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 3667-3680Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, we have demonstrated that Mi-2 does not localize to the sites of DNA damage (Fig. 2B) in contrast to other chromatin remodeling complexes, such as SWI/SNF (27.Park J.H. Park E.J. Lee H.S. Kim S.J. Hur S.K. Imbalzano A.N. Kwon J. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3986-3997Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). It is also interesting to note that not all NuRD complex members are similarly up-regulated following UV exposure (Fig. 1). It is possible that Mi-2 is the limiting protein in the complex and its up-regulation is sufficient to increase complex formation and activity. Mi-2 could also be acting independent of the NuRD complex. Mi-2 has been shown to act as a transcriptional activator. Mi-2α was recently determined to co-activate c-Myb independent of ATPase activity (8.Saether T. Berge T. Ledsaak M. Matre V. Alm-Kristiansen A.H. Dahle O. Aubry F. Gabrielsen O.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13994-14005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The role of other NuRD complex members in regulating c-Myb activity in this study was not addressed. However, another study demonstrated that Mi-2β is required for T cell development through its activation of the E box-binding protein HEB and concomitant expression of CD4 (28.Williams C.J. Naito T. Arco P.G. Seavitt J.R. Cashman S.M. De Souza B. Qi X. Keables P. Von Andrian U.H. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 2004; 20: 719-733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This function is dependent upon Mi-2β interaction with p300. Importantly, a HEB/Mi-2/p300 complex lacked HDAC2, strongly supporting a model of NuRD-independent activity. Taken together, the biological significance of Mi-2 regulation following UV exposure has broad implications and will be addressed in future investigations. Mi-2 Regulation and Dermatomyositis—Mi-2 protein was first identified as the target of autoantibodies in patients with DM. Whereas development of these autoantibodies against Mi-2 is not known to be causative and is not required for development of the disease, studies suggest that roughly 20% of patients present these autoantibodies (13.Callen J.P. Wortmann R.L. Clin. Dermatol. 2006; 24: 363-373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). However, the striking characteristic of Mi-2 autoantigenicity is its specific finding in DM as compared with other forms of autoimmune and nonautoimmune muscle disease. In fact, 97% of patients with Mi-2 specific antibodies suffer from DM (29.Sordet C. Goetz J. Sibilia J. Joint Bone Spine. 2006; 73: 646-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our results may provide an explanation for these findings. Increased expression of Mi-2 in the UV-induced dermatitis may provide the antigen presentation required for the development and maintenance of the autoantibodies. This hypothesis is supported by related studies from the literature suggesting that autoimmunity in many forms of myositis may be the result of altered autoantigen presentation rather than a defect in selectivity seen in other autoimmune diseases. Studies have shown overexpression of the myositis antigens Jo-1, Mi-2, DNA, PKCS, and U1-RNP in patients with the disease (30.Casciola-Rosen L. Nagaraju K. Plotz P. Wang K. Levine S. Gabrielson E. Corse A. Rosen A. J. Exp. Med. 2005; 201: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Moreover, a mouse model overexpressing HLA presentation molecules specifically in muscle induced myositis in all animals (31.Nagaraju K. Raben N. Loeffler L. Parker T. Rochon P.J. Lee E. Danning C. Wada R. Thompson C. Bahtiyar G. Craft J. Hooft Van Huijsduijnen R. Plotz P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9209-9214Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Another mouse model has demonstrated that muscle lesions can generate an immune response to muscle components and provides a model comparable to skin lesions in DM patients following UV exposure (32.Stevens A.M. Sullivan K.M. Nelson J.L. Rheumatology (Oxford). 2003; 42: 34-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been shown in humans that antigen expression within myositis tissue is higher than that seen in normal muscle (14.Suber T.L. Casciola-Rosen L. Rosen A. Nat. Clin. Pract. Rheumatol. 2008; 4: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These data, taken together with the prior association of UV exposure with the development of Mi-2 autoantibodies and exacerbations of distinctive skin rashes in DM (18.Okada S. Weatherhead E. Targoff I.N. Wesley R. Miller F.W. Arthritis Rheum. 2003; 48: 2285-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 33.Ghirardello A. Zampieri S. Iaccarino L. Tarricone E. Bendo R. Gambari P.F.

https://openalex.org/W2080115164,"In this study, we show that methylselenol, a selenometabolite implicated in cancer prevention, did not directly inactivate protein kinase C (PKC). Nonetheless, its oxidation product, methylseleninic acid (MSA), inactivated PKC at low micromolar concentrations through a redox modification of vicinal cysteine sulfhydryls in the catalytic domain of PKC. This modification of PKC that occurred in both isolated form and in intact cells was reversed by a reductase system involving thioredoxin reductase, a selenoprotein. PKC isoenzymes exhibited variable sensitivity to MSA with Ca2+-dependent PKC isoenzymes (α, β, and γ) being the most susceptible, followed by isoenzymes δ and ϵ. Other enzymes tested were inactivated only with severalfold higher concentrations of MSA than those required for PKC inactivation. This specificity for PKC was further enhanced when MSA was generated within close proximity to PKC through a reaction of methylselenol with PKC-bound lipid peroxides in the membrane. The MSA-methylselenol redox cycle resulted in the catalytic oxidation of sulfhydryls even with nanomolar concentrations of selenium. MSA inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in DU145 prostate cancer cells at a concentration that was higher than that needed to inhibit purified PKCα but in a range comparable with that required for the inhibition of PKCϵ. This MSA-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis decreased with a conditional overexpression of PKCϵ and increased with its knock-out by small interfering RNA. Conceivably, when MSA is generated within the vicinity of PKC, it specifically inactivates PKC isoenzymes, particularly the promitogenic and prosurvival ϵ isoenzyme, and this inactivation causes growth inhibition and apoptosis.

Epidemiological, experimental, and preliminary clinical data suggest that dietary supplementation with selenium can prevent cancer (1.Ip C. Ganther H.E.

Supplemental selenium may reduce the incidence and mortality of prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers, but it has not been shown to be effective against breast and skin cancers in humans (4.Clark L.C. Combs Jr., G.F. Turnbull B.W. Slate E.H. Chalker D.K. Chow J. Davis L.S. Glover R.A. Graham G.F. Gross E.G. Krongrad A. Lesher Jr., J.L. Park H.K. Sanders Jr., B.B. Smith C.L. Taylor J.R. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 1996; 276: 1957-1963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is imperative to know why selenium prevents cancers in certain tissues but not in others. Currently, large scale trials are underway to evaluate the efficacy of selenium in prostate cancer prevention (5.Klein E.A. Thompson I.M. Lippman S.M. Goodman P.J. Albanes D. Taylor P.R. Coltman C. J. Urol. 2001; 166: 1311-1315Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 6.Thompson I.M. Coltman Jr., C.A. Crowley J.

Nevertheless, the chemopreventive mechanism of selenium and the molecular targets upon which selenium acts are largely unknown. The cancer-preventive efficacy of selenium depends on its chemical form (8.El-Bayoumy K. Rao C.V. Reddy B.S. Nutr. Cancer. 2001; 40: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because naturally occurring organic forms of selenium such as selenomethionine (–2 Se) and and Se-methylselenocysteine (–2 Se) are safer than inorganic selenite (+4 Se), they are the forms of selenium considered to be ideal for dietary supplementation. These parent selenocompounds are ultimately metabolized to methylselenol, 2Methylselenol exists predominantly as its ionized form methylselenolate at pH 7.4.2Methylselenol exists predominantly as its ionized form methylselenolate at pH 7.4. a postulated intermediate that carries out the chemopreventive actions of selenium (1.Ip C.

When selenium is given to experimental animals at a nutritionally adequate dose (0.1 ppm), its physiological functions are believed to be mediated primarily by selenoproteins such as thioredoxin reductase (TR) 3The abbreviations used are: TR, thioredoxin reductase; PKC, protein kinase C; MSA, methylseleninic acid; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); DTT, dithiothreitol; MTT, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; PKA, protein kinase A; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; PK, phosphorylase kinase; NTSB, 2-nitro-5-thiosulfobenzoate.3The abbreviations used are: TR, thioredoxin reductase; PKC, protein kinase C; MSA, methylseleninic acid; DTNB, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid); DTT, dithiothreitol; MTT, 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; PDBu, phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; PKA, protein kinase A; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; PK, phosphorylase kinase; NTSB, 2-nitro-5-thiosulfobenzoate. and glutathione peroxidase (10.Combs Jr., G.F.

Nonetheless, when selenium is given at high doses (>5 ppm), its toxicity is thought to be mediated by selenometabolites (10.Combs Jr., G.F. Gray W.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). When selenium is given at cancer-preventive intermediate doses (1–3 ppm), it is unclear whether selenium carries out its preventive actions through selenometabolites, selenoproteins, or a combination of both. Selenometabolites are well known to inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis at micromolar concentrations (13.Sinha R. Unni E. Ganther H.E. Medina D. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 14.Jiang C. Wang Z. Ganther H. Lu J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3062-3070PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Nilsonne G. Sun X. Nystrom C. Rundlof A.-K. Potamitou Fernandes A. Bjornstedt M. Dobra K. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 41: 874-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). However, at cancer-preventive doses, the majority (9.Ip C. Thompson H.J. Zhu Z. Ganther H.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 2882-2886PubMed Google Scholar) of selenium in circulation is present as selenoproteins or is bound to proteins, and only a limited amount (<5%) is present as selenometabolites (10.Combs Jr., G.F. Gray W.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 79: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Cancer cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis are considered to be important for the chemopreventive actions of selenium, but it is challenging to demonstrate how these actions can occur in vivo when such low concentrations of selenium are available to tissues. In this context, it is noteworthy to mention that the concentration of selenium required for in vitro inhibition of tumor promotion is lower than that required for growth inhibition or apoptosis of established malignant cells (16.Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 17.Borek C. Ong A. Mason H. Donahue L. Biaglow J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1490-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 18.Sharma S. Stutzman J.D. Kelloff G.J. Steele V.E. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5848-5855PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is crucial to determine which mechanism(s) selenium, at cancer-preventive concentrations, utilizes to selectively kill precancer or cancer cells without causing global toxicity to the host. Moreover, it is also important to identify which specific molecular targets selenium uses to inhibit tumor promotion and progression. Protein kinase C (PKC) may be a potential target involved in both tumor promotion and progression (19.Gopalakrishna R. Jaken S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1349-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 20.Blumberg P.M. Mol. Carcinog. 1991; 4: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that chemopreventive agents such as selenium act on the same target as tumor promoters do but induce an opposing response (21.Gopalakrishna R. Gundimeda U. Nutr. Cancer. 2001; 40: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this scenario, the cancer-preventive agent efficiently counteracts tumor promoter-induced effects. Moreover, several of the tumor promotion or cancer prevention mechanisms may involve redox-sensitive targets (19.Gopalakrishna R. Jaken S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1349-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). PKC is a unique target for oxidants (19.Gopalakrishna R. Jaken S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1349-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Whether PKC is activated or inactivated by oxidation depends on the type of oxidant, the site of oxidation, and the extent of modification (22.Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The regulatory domain of PKC contains a C1 module with a cysteine-rich region that coordinates four atoms of zinc (23.Kazanietz M.G. Wang S. Milne G.W. Lewin N.E. Liu H.L. Blumberg P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21852-21859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Selective modification of this autoinhibitory domain is induced by treatment with low concentrations of oxidants, resulting in a cofactor-independent activation of PKC (19.Gopalakrishna R. Jaken S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 1349-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 22.Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Alternatively, some oxidants, alkylating agents, and certain cancer-preventive agents modify cysteine residues present within the catalytic domain, leading to the inactivation of PKC (24.Gopalakrishna R. Gundimeda U. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: S3819-S3823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Chu F. Chen L.H. O'Brian C.A. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26.Drake E.N. Med. Hypotheses. 2006; 67: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Because PKC is a family of more than 11 phospholipid-dependent serine/threonine protein kinases that vary in structure (27.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4219) Google Scholar, 28.Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 29.Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), these isoenzymes may have difference(s) in susceptibility to redox-modifying agents. Generally, PKC isoenzymes are divided into three categories based on the cofactors that are required for optimal catalytic activity (27.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4219) Google Scholar, 28.Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 29.Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). Conventional PKCs (α, β, and γ) are calcium-dependent and are stimulated by a second messenger diacylglycerol. Novel PKCs (δ, ϵ, η, and θ) are also activated by diacylglycerol but in a calcium-independent fashion. Atypical PKCs (ζ and λ/ι) require neither calcium nor diacylglycerol for optimal activity. Although most cells express more than one type of PKC, differences among the isoenzymes with respect to activation conditions and subcellular locations suggest that individual PKC isoenzymes mediate distinct cellular processes (27.Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4219) Google Scholar, 28.Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 29.Newton A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). For example, in most cell types, PKCϵ is a pro-mitogenic and pro-survival kinase, whereas PKCδ is an antiproliferative and proapoptotic kinase (28.Griner E.M. Kazanietz M.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 30.Gonzalez-Guerrico A.M. Meshki J. Xiao L. Benavides F. Conti C.J. Kanzanietz M.G. J. Biochem. Mol.

Opposing actions of PKCα and PKCδ were also reported (32.Deucher A. Efimova T. Eckert R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17032-17040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that methylseleninic acid 4Methylseleninic acid exists predominantly as its ionized form methylseleninate at pH 7.4.4Methylseleninic acid exists predominantly as its ionized form methylseleninate at pH 7.4. (MSA), which is locally generated by the reaction of methylselenol with lipid peroxides, specifically inactivates PKC isoenzymes. MSA does this by inducing a redox modification of the cysteine-rich region in the catalytic domain, and this modification can be reversed by the TR system. Additionally, we demonstrate that the overexpression of PKCϵ, a prosurvival isoenzyme that is moderately sensitive to MSA, results in a resistance to selenium-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Materials—5,5′-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), protein kinase A (500 Sigma units/mg protein), N-acetyl-l-cysteine, aprotinin, leupeptin, dithiothreitol (DTT), pepstatin A, ebselen, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, 1,2-diolein, (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (MTT), and hydrogen peroxide were from Sigma. Benzeneselenol and cumene hydroperoxide were from Aldrich. Auranofin and [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 20 Ci/mmol) were from MP Biochemicals. [20-3H]Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (specific activity 20 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The MSA used in these experiments was a kind gift from Dr. Howard Ganther, University of Wisconsin, Madison. The homogeneous phosphorylase kinase (PK) purified from rabbit skeletal muscle was a generous gift from Dr. Balawant Khatra, California State University, Long Beach. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was partially purified from rabbit skeletal muscle as described previously (33.Killilea S.D. Mellgren R.L. Aylward J.H. Metieh M.E. Lee E.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 193: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). TR and thioredoxin were purified to homogeneity from calf thymus (34.Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4600-4606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). TR has a specific activity of 22 units/mg protein, where 1 unit oxidizes 1 μmol of NADPH/min. PKC isoenzymes α, β, γ, δ, and ϵ were partially purified from rat brains with specific activities of ∼540, 460, 490, 220, and 360 units/mg protein, respectively (22.Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 36.Ogita K. Miyamoto S. Yamaguchi K. Koide H. Fujisawa N. Kikkawa U. Sahara S. Fukami Y. Nishizuka Y.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 482-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). PKCζ, with a specific activity of 520 units/mg protein, was partially purified from rabbit kidneys (38.Nakanishi H. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16347-16354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some cases, a mixture of Ca2+-dependent isoenzymes α, β, and γ (specific activity of 890 units/mg protein) was used, as Ca2+-dependent hydrophobic chromatography can purify these isoenzymes to homogeneity in high amounts (22.Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The catalytic and regulatory domains of PKC isoenzymes (α, β, and γ) were separated by trypsin treatment and then chromatographically isolated (39.Gopalakrishna R. Gundimeda U. Chen Z.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 25-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Using previously published procedures, we raised rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PKC isoenzymes by injecting hemocyanin coupled with sequence-specific peptides from the variable regions in PKC isoenzymes (40.Kosaka Y. Ogita K. Ase K. Nomura H. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 151: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). These peptides and a PKC-specific substrate peptide that corresponds to a neurogranin amino acid sequence (residues 25–43) were synthesized at the core facility of Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. Cell Culture and Treatments—Androgen-independent DU145 prostate carcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 0.05 mg/ml streptomycin. MSA was diluted in Hanks' balanced salt solution and added to the culture medium. In some experiments, when benzeneselenol was used as a surrogate to methylselenol, its sulfur analog benzenethiol was used as a control. When agents were dissolved in organic solvents, appropriate solvent controls were used. PKC Assay—The assays of PKC as well as of other protein kinases were carried out in 96-well plates with fitted filtration disks made of Durapore membrane (41.Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. Wilson J.C. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, PKC reaction samples containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.33 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (3 million cpm), histone H1 (0.1 mg/ml), 40 μm leupeptin, and 25 μl of PKC sample in a total volume of 125 μl were incubated for 5 min at 30 °C. After arresting the reaction with trichloroacetic acid and ultrafiltration, we determined the radioactivity associated with the protein retained on the membrane. In certain cases, histone H1 was replaced with 5 μm neurogranin substrate polypeptide (residues 25–43), and the above reactions were instead carried out in regular 96-well plates without filtration disks. The reaction was arrested with 10 μl of 1 m phosphoric acid; the samples were applied to Whatman P81 paper (2 × 2 cm), and the papers were washed four times with 75 mm phosphoric acid. Radioactivity retained in the washed paper was counted. The basal activity observed in the absence of cofactors was subtracted from the activity observed in the presence of cofactors. The difference was expressed as PKC activity in units, where 1 unit of enzyme transfers 1 nmol of phosphate to either histone H1 or neurogranin polypeptide per min at 30 °C. Because assaying PKC by using histone H1 as a substrate is relatively simple, it was utilized for determining the activity of conventional PKC isoenzymes (α, β, and γ). Histone H1, however, is not a good substrate for measuring the activity of novel and atypical isoenzymes. On the other hand, the neurogranin substrate peptide is appropriate for determining the phosphotransferase activity of all PKC isoenzymes (42.Chen S.J. Klann E. Gower M.C. Powell C.M. Sessoms J.S. Sweatt J.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1032-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used this substrate for determining the combined activity of all PKC isoenzymes in cell extracts. Phorbol Ester Binding—The phorbol ester binding of isolated PKC was carried out by a multiwell filtration approach using [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) as a ligand (41.Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. Wilson J.C. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Purified PKC was incubated with selenocompounds in multiwell plates for 5 min at 30 °C. Phosphatidylserine (2.5 μg) was added, followed by a PDBu-binding mixture. Samples were incubated for an additional 10 min at 30 °C, and the [3H]PDBu bound to PKC was determined as described previously (41.Gopalakrishna R. Chen Z.H. Gundimeda U. Wilson J.C. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 24-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Quantitation of Cysteine Sulfhydryls and Disulfides in MSA-modified PKC—A mixture of PKC isoenzymes (α, β, and γ) that can be purified in large amounts was used for this experiment. Sulfhydryl residues in PKC were quantitated by employing previously published methods using DTNB (43.Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21218) Google Scholar), except a 96-well plate was utilized to enhance the sensitivity of the assay in measuring low amounts of protein sulfhydryls. The disulfides were determined after sulfitolysis using sodium sulfite. The sulfhydryls liberated (one per each disulfide) by this reaction were quantitated with NTSB by utilizing a modified method (44.Thannhauser T.W. Konishi Y. Scheraga H.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The incubations were carried out in two sets, each one in a 96-well plate. Highly purified PKC (0.5 nmol) free from thiol agents was incubated with MSA in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA for 25 min at 30 °C, in a total volume of 180 μl. Then 20 μl of 4 mm DTNB solution was added to one set of samples. To another set of samples, 20 μl of 4 mm NTSB, 100 mm sulfite solution was added. After incubating the samples in the dark for 10 min, the absorbance of the thionitrobenzoic acid formed in the reactions was determined at 405 nm by using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Isolation of PKC from Cells Treated with MSA—DU145 cells were grown in 100-mm Petri dishes in minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were serum-starved at confluency by incubation with serum-free medium (0.1% serum) for 24 h. Cells were treated with MSA and then homogenized in buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 150 nm pepstatin A, 1% Igepal CA-630). Unless otherwise indicated, mercapto-compounds were omitted from all of the buffers used for cell homogenization and chromatographic isolation of PKC. The cell extracts were subjected to DEAE-cellulose chromatography as described previously (22.Gopalakrishna R. Anderson W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6758-6762Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Western Immunoblotting for PKC Isoenzymes—Cells were serum-starved overnight and treated with MSA. Cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Electrophoretically separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk and subsequently incubated with the indicated PKC isoenzyme-specific primary antibodies followed by goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The immuno-reactive bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot detection kit (Pierce). These bands were analyzed by densitometric scanning using the Omega 12 IC Molecular Imaging System and UltraQuant software. Stable Transfection of PKCϵ—The metallothionein expression vector (45.Olah Z. Lehel C. Jakab G. Anderson W.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) used in these experiments was a kind gift from Dr. Wayne Anderson, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda. The cells were transfected with either a metallothionein-driven PKCϵ expression vector (to overexpress PKCϵ) or an empty vector (as a control) using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's recommended procedure. One day after transfection, DU145 cells were plated at a lower density and grown in a selection medium containing 450 μg/ml G418. After 4 weeks in the selection medium, single colonies were picked, expanded, and screened for the presence of PKCϵ by using Western blot analysis. Zinc acetate (75 μm) was used for the optimal expression of PKCϵ in these transfectants. Transient Transfection of DU145 Cells with PKCϵ siRNA—DU145 cells (1 × 104/ml) were plated in a 6-well plate. After 24 h, 50 nm PKCϵ siRNA oligonucleotides (three predesigned Silencer oligonucleotides from Ambion) were transfected into DU145 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. As a negative control, we used scrambled siRNA that did not exhibit homology to any encoding region but had similar GC content. The efficiency of transfection and knock-out of PKCϵ was determined by Western immunoblotting. In the conditions used, immunoblot of other PKC isoenzymes such as α, β, γ, and δ were not affected by the transfection with PKCϵ siRNA oligonucleotides, demonstrating the specificity involved in the knock-out procedure. The experiments were continued with the PKCϵ siRNA oligonucleotide that produced the greatest knock-out (a decrease of ∼80% from the control). Cell Growth Assay—Cells grown in 96-well plates were treated with various concentrations of MSA for 48 h. The cells were then fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid. After washing them with water, the cells were stained with a 0.4% solution of sulforhodamine B for 30 min. The excess dye was removed by washing the cells with 1% acetic acid, and the dye bound to the cells was later dissolved in 10 mm Tris base. The absorbance was read at 550 nm as a growth index (46.Skehan P. Storeng R. Scudiero D. Monks A. McMahon J. Vistica D. Warren J.T. Bokesch H. Kenney S. Boyd M.R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1990; 82: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (8777) Google Scholar). Cell Viability Assay—We assessed the cytotoxicity of MSA using the MTT reduction assay. Initially, DU145 cells were grown in 96-well plates and treated with MSA for 24 h. Then an MTT solution (5 mg/ml) in Hanks' balanced salt solution was added, and the plates were incubated for 4 h. The formazan formed was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and the absorbance was read at 550 nm (47.Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45867) Google Scholar). Apoptosis Assay—To assess morphological changes in the chromatin structure of DU145 cells undergoing apoptosis, cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Cells were grown on culture slides, treated with MSA for 24 h, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature. After rinsing them with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were stained with DAPI (10 μg/ml) for 5 min. The morphology of the nuclei was observed using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE300) at an excitation wavelength of 345 nm. Apoptotic nuclei were identified by chromatin condensation and fragmentation. The incidence of apoptosis in each preparation was analyzed by counting 500 cells and determining the percentage of apoptotic nuclei (48.Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Bernabo J.L. Caamano J. Ohba M.

https://openalex.org/W2123060964,"Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1, also known as Flt-1) is involved in complex biological processes often associated to severe pathological conditions like cancer, inflammation, and metastasis formation. Consequently, the search for antagonists of Flt-1 has recently gained a growing interest. Here we report the identification of a tetrameric tripeptide from a combinatorial peptide library built using non-natural amino acids, which binds Flt-1 and inhibits in vitro its interaction with placental growth factor (PlGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A and B (IC50 ∼ 10 ;m). The peptide is stable in serum for 7 days and prevents both Flt-1 phosphorylation and the capillary-like tube formation of human primary endothelial cells stimulated by PlGF or VEGF-A. Conversely, the identified peptide does not interfere in VEGF-induced VEGFR-2 activation. In vivo, this peptide inhibits VEGF-A- and PlGF-induced neoangiogenesis in the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay. In contrast, in the cornea, where avascularity is maintained by high levels of expression of the soluble form of Flt-1 receptor (sFlt-1) that prevents the VEGF-A activity, the peptide is able to stimulate corneal mouse neovascularization in physiological condition, as reported previously for others neutralizing anti-Flt-1 molecules. This tetrameric tripeptide represents a new, promising compound for therapeutic approaches in pathologies where Flt-1 activation plays a crucial role.

Three members of the VEGF family involved in angiogenesis bind and activate VEGF receptors; VEGF-A binds both Flt-1 and KDR receptors, whereas two other VEGF family members, VEGF-B and placental growth factor (PlGF), specifically bind Flt-1. The activity of VEGF-A is crucial both in physiological and in pathological angiogenesis, whereas that of PlGF and VEGF-B appears to be restricted to pathological conditions (5De Falco S. Gigante B.

Recently it has been reported that neutralizing mAb anti-PlGF is able to inhibit tumor angiogenesis with an efficacy comparable with that observed blocking VEGF/Flk-1 pathway (15Fischer C. Jonckx B.

In contrast to KDR, which is predominantly expressed by endothelial cells (ECs), expression of Flt-1 has been detected and functionally demonstrated also in smooth muscle cells (16Wang H. Keiser J.A.

The activation of Flt-1 is not only crucial for ECs stimulation during the neoangiogenesis process (18Errico M. Riccioni T. Iyer S. Pisano C. Acharya K.R. Persico M.G. De Falco S. J. Biol.

Furthermore, Flt-1 activation is decisive in the recruitment of bone marrow-derived endothelial cells and hematopoietic precursors in tumor angiogenesis (12Lyden D. Hattori K. Dias S. Costa C. Blaikie P. Butros L. Chadburn A. Heissig B. Marks W. Witte L. Wu Y. Hicklin D. Zhu Z. Hackett N.R. Crystal R.G. Moore M.A. Hajjar K.A. Manova K. Benezra R. Rafii S. Nat.

Med. 2002; 8: 831-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been shown that Flt-1-positive hematopoietic bone marrow progenitors are involved in the establishment of premetastatic niche and that an anti-Flt-1 mAb completely prevents metastatic process (24Kaplan R.N. Riba R.D. Zacharoulis S. Bramley A.H. Vincent L. Costa C. MacDonald D.D. Jin D.K. Shido K. Kerns S.A. Zhu Z. Hicklin D. Wu Y. Port J.L. Altorki N. Port E.R. Ruggero D. Shmelkov S.V. Jensen K.K.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10705-10709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar) that represents one of the most potent physiological inhibitors of VEGFs activity. Indeed, it is expressed during embryonic development, where it regulates the availability of VEGF and, as recently reported, in the adults, it plays a pivotal role to maintain corneal avascularity (26Ambati B.K. Nozaki M. Singh N. Takeda A. Jani P.D. Suthar T. Albuquerque R.J. Richter E. Sakurai E. Newcomb M.T. Kleinman M.E. Caldwell R.B. Lin Q. Ogura Y. Orecchia A. Samuelson D.A. Agnew D.W. St Leger J.

Raisler B.J. Ambati J. Nature. 2006; 443: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data strongly indicate Flt-1 as an ideal target for fighting a number of major diseases (7Luttun A. Tjwa M. Carmeliet P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 979: 80-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In the effort to identify new molecules able to selectively bind Flt-1 and neutralize its activity, we screened a random combinatorial tetrameric tripeptide library built using non-natural amino acids, using a competitive ELISA-based assay (27De Falco S. Ruvoletto M.G. Verdoliva A. Ruvo M. Raucci A. Marino M. Senatore S. Cassani G. Alberti A. Pontisso P. Fassina G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36613-36623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The peptide mixtures composing the library were utilized as competitors of the PlGF/Flt-1 binding, and the most active component was isolated following an iterative process (28Marino M. Ruvo M. De Falco S. Fassina G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Verdoliva A. Marasco D. De Capua A. Saporito A. Bellofiore P. Manfredi V. Fattorusso R. Pedone C. Ruvo M. ChemBioChem. 2005; 6: 1242-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The biological activity of the selected peptide has then been assessed in several in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrating that it is a highly stable and selective Flt-1 binder able to suppress the receptor activation. Synthesis of Combinatorial Tetrameric Tripeptide Library and Analogues of 4-23-5 Peptide—The peptide library was prepared using all commercially available amino acids and resins purchased from Chem-Impex International (Wood Dale, IL) and from Novabiochem (Laufelfingen, CH). As 30 different blocks were utilized (supplemental Table S1), a theoretical number of 27,000 peptides was generated, split in 30 separate pools of 900 peptides each. All residues were 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-derivatized (>99%) and were utilized without any further purification. Amino acids in the d configuration and others bearing trifluoroacetic acid-stable side chain protections were chosen to increase the library chemical diversity and, at the same time, to introduce resistance to enzyme degradation (30Bracci L. Falciani C. Lelli B. Lozzi L. Runci Y. Pini A. De Montis M.G. Tagliamonte A. Neri P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46590-46595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) for in vitro and in vivo applications. The library was chemically synthesized following the Fmoc methodology (31Fields G.B. Noble R.L. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 35: 161-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2336) Google Scholar), and sequence randomization was achieved applying the portioning-mixing process as reported elsewhere (28Marino M. Ruvo M. De Falco S. Fassina G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) (see also the supplemental Experimental Procedures). Other molecules, such as the monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric tripeptide variants, as well as the Ala-scanning peptides (where the monomers were systematically changed to alanine), were similarly prepared using suitable protecting groups. The cyclic dimeric variant was prepared as described elsewhere (29Verdoliva A. Marasco D. De Capua A. Saporito A. Bellofiore P. Manfredi V. Fattorusso R. Pedone C. Ruvo M. ChemBioChem. 2005; 6: 1242-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Iterative Deconvolution of Tetrameric Tripeptide Library—Recombinant PlGF, VEGF-A, VEGF-B, VEGFR-1/Fc chimera, VEGFR-2/Fc chimera of human and mouse origin, and normal or biotinylated antibodies anti-PlGF, anti-VEGF-A, and anti-VEGF-B were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). At every step of the deconvolution process, peptide pools were tested with a molar excess of 1,000-fold (calculated on each single peptide) over PlGF (1.3 × 10-10 m). Following the identification of active pools, dose-dependent inhibition experiments using 500-, 1,000-, 1,500-, and 2,000-fold excess were performed to confirm the inhibitory capacity. The first active pool identified was the 4-X-X (X indicates randomized positions) where “4” identified the amino acid d-glutamic acid (d-Glu, supplemental Table S1). This pool was resynthesized in 30 subpools each composed of 30 peptides and submitted to the second screening round that allowed the identification of the subpool 23 (4-23-X). The number “23” identified the amino acid l-cysteine(S-benzyl) (supplemental Table S1). Finally, the 30 single peptides composing the 4-23-X pool were synthesized and submitted to the final screening. The peptide 4-23-5, where the number “5” identified the amino acid l-cyclohexylalanine (supplemental Table S1), was the unique molecule showing inhibitory activity. ELISA-based Assays—The competitive ELISA-based assay (27De Falco S. Ruvoletto M.G. Verdoliva A. Ruvo M. Raucci A. Marino M. Senatore S. Cassani G. Alberti A. Pontisso P. Fassina G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36613-36623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) for the screening of the peptide library and for dose-dependent experiments was performed by coating on 96-well plates a recombinant form of Fc/Flt-1 at 0.5 ;g/ml, 100 ;l/well (the same volume was used for all subsequent steps), 16 h at room temperature. The plate was then blocked for 3 h at room temperature with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and a recombinant form of PlGF at 5 ng/ml concentration in PBS containing 0.1% BSA, 5 mm EDTA, 0.004% Tween 20 (PBET) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C followed by 1 h at room temperature. A biotinylated anti-human PlGF polyclonal antibody diluted in PBET at 300 ng/ml was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C followed by 1 h at room temperature. A solution containing an avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase macromolecular complex was prepared as suggested by the manufacturer (Vectastain elite ABC kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at room temperature followed by the horseradish peroxidase substrate composed of 1 mg/ml ortho-phenylenediamine in 50 mm citrate phosphate buffer, pH 5, 0.006% of H2O2, incubated for 40 min in the dark at room temperature. The reaction was blocked by adding 30 ;l/well of 4 n H2SO4, and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm on a microplate reader (BenchMark, Bio-Rad). Peptide pools or single peptides dissolved in DMSO were properly diluted and added to the wells along with ligand. For dose-dependent experiments performed with VEGF-A and VEGF-B, 10 ng/ml recombinant proteins and 500 ng/ml polyclonal antibody, anti-human VEGF-A or anti-human VEGF-B, were used. 4-23-5 and control peptides were used at concentrations ranging between 1.56 and 50.0 ;m. Using the same ELISA-based assay, the inhibitory capacities of alanine-scan peptides and structurally related analogues (supplemental Table S3) were investigated in both PlGF and VEGF interaction with Flt-1 receptor. Analogues were used at 50 ;m, whereas the 4-23-5 peptide was used at 12.5 ;m. To evaluate the binding of the 4-23-5 peptide to Flt-1 receptor, the peptide or the negative controls were coated at 20 ;m. for 16 h at 4 °C. A recombinant form of extracellular domains of human and mouse Flt-1 receptors fused to human Fc in PBET was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C followed by 30 min at room temperature. Goat anti-human Fc antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) and the secondary donkey anti-goat hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), both at 1:1000 dilution, were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, plates were developed as described above. To evaluate the binding of 4-23-5 to VEGFR-2, recombinant human Fc/KDR and mouse Fc/Flk-1 were used. To evaluate the ability of PlGF and VEGF-A to compete the interaction of Flt-1 with the synthetic ligand, 4-23-5 was coated at 20 ;m, and the human Fc/Flt-1 receptor was used at a fixed concentration (125 pm). The dose-dependent competition was performed using PlGF and VEGF-A at concentrations ranging between 0.05 and 6.25 nm. Stability Assay—The selected 4-23-5 peptide was dissolved in neat DMSO at a 10 mg/ml concentration. The sample was then serially diluted in PBS, pH 7.3, containing 10% fetal calf serum to obtain 100 ;g/ml solutions and incubated at 37 °C for 168 h. 10-;l aliquots (1.0 ;g of total peptide) were removed after every hour within the first 12 h and subsequently at 24, 72, 120, and 168 h. Samples were immediately centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm and analyzed by reverse phase-HPLC after discarding the pellet. To closely check the peptide concentration within samples, a reference curve was obtained by analyzing, under the same conditions, different amounts of the pure compound dissolved in DMSO (the peptide solubility in DMSO is >100 mg/ml). The reference curve was also used to exclude effects of sample subtraction by nonspecific binding to albumin or other serum proteins. The experiment was carried out in duplicate, and the data were reported as residual peptide in solution (in percentages) versus time. Inhibition of Flt-1 Phosphorylation and Capillary-like Tube Formation—These assays were performed as described elsewhere (18Errico M. Riccioni T. Iyer S. Pisano C. Acharya K.R. Persico M.G. De Falco S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43929-43939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In phosphorylation experiments, to induce Flt-1 and KDR receptor activation, 20 ng/ml PlGF and 50 ng/ml VEGF were used on starved 293-Flt-1 or HUVEC cells. To detect phosphorylated forms of receptors in Western blot experiments, anti-pFlt-1 (R&D Systems) at 1:500 dilution and anti-pKDR (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) at 1:1000 dilution antibodies were used. Capillary-like tube formation were performed in 24-well culture plates. At the end of the experiment, the culture medium was replaced with PBS, and the images were captured with the inverted microscope Leica DM IRB (Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a Leica DC 350 FX camera (original magnification ×10). Images were acquired with Leica FW 4000 software. Chicken Embryo Chorioallantoic Membrane (CAM) Assay—Alginate beads (5 ;l) containing vehicle, 150 ng/embryo of VEGF-A, or 250 ng/embryo of PlGF with or without peptides (0.25 and 0.025 nmol/embryo) were prepared as described previously (32Mitola S. Belleri M. Urbinati C. Coltrini D. Sparatore B. Pedrazzi M. Melloni E. Presta M. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and placed on top of the CAM of fertilized White Leghorn chicken eggs at day 11 of incubation (6-8 eggs per experimental group). After 72 h, new blood vessels converging toward the implant were counted by two observers in a double-blind fashion under a stereomicroscope and photographed in ovo at original magnification ×5, using a STEMI SR stereomicroscope, equipped with an objective f equal to 100 mm with adapter ring 475070 (Zeiss, Germany) and a Camedia C-4040 digital camera (Olympus, Melville, NY). Images were acquired and processed using the Image-Pro Plus software. Differences among groups were tested by one-way analysis of variance using the SPSS statistical package (version 12.1, Chicago, IL). Cornea Neovascularization (CNV)—Single injections (33-gauge needle) of 0.40, 4.0, or 20 nmol of peptide 4-23-5 and of only 20 nmol of control peptide in the same volume of DMSO were carried out in the corneas of BALB/c mice (n = 3 each group). Eyes were harvested 7 days after injection, corneas were gently isolated, and immunohistochemical staining for endothelial cells was performed. Corneas were fixed in 100% acetone for 20 min, washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 for 10 min four consecutive times, and blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 48 h. The corneas were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-coupled monoclonal anti-mouse CD31 antibody (Pharmingen) at 3:1000 and rabbit anti-mouse LYVE-1 antibody (Abcam, Cambrige, UK) at 3:1000 in 3% BSA PBS solution at 4 °C for 48 h. The corneas were washed as described previously and incubated in Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit at 3:1000 in 3% BSA PBS solution for 2 h, after which they were washed and mounted with an antifading agent (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories). The corneal flat mounts were visualized with a fluorescent microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E) equipped with Nikon DXM200F camera at original magnification ×4. Images acquisitions were performed with Nikon, ACT-1 software, version 2.63. Blood vessels were identified as CD31-positive and LYVE-1-negative. Synthesis, Characterization, and Screening of the Combinatorial Peptide Library—To increase the molecular surface, the library was assembled as described previously (28Marino M. Ruvo M. De Falco S. Fassina G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 735-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) on a peptide scaffold composed by a polylysine core (supplemental Fig. S1) (33Tam J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5409-5413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). To obtain mixtures, three levels of randomization were achieved applying the portioning-mixing method (34Furka A. Sebestyen F. Asgedom M. Dibo G. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1991; 37: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar, 35Lam K.S. Salmon S.E. Hersh E.M. Hruby V.J. Kazmierski W.M. Knapp R.J. Nature. 1991; 354: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar). The tetrameric library was synthesized using 29 non-natural amino acids plus glycine (supplemental Table S1) and was initially arranged in 30 pools, each identified with the N-terminal building block. Each pool contained 900 different molecules (302). The total complexity of the library was instead determined by the formula 303 = 27,000 different peptides. Peptide mixtures were obtained in high yield (about 70%) as calculated assuming an average molecular mass of 2130 atomic mass units for each library component and with an average purity of the crude products >85% (as determined on the single molecules assayed during the last screening round, not shown). The liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses of some selected 30-component mixtures showed that the expected molecules were almost all equally represented and that molecular weights were in very good agreement with those calculated (not shown). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses of single peptides also showed very good agreement between calculated and experimental molecular weights (supplemental Table S2). The screening was carried out by a competition assay, whereby the displacement of soluble recombinant PlGF from coated Flt-1 by the peptide pools was evaluated. PlGF was used in the assay as, among all the VEGF family members, it shows the highest affinity for Flt-1 (6Shibuya M. Angiogenesis. 2006; 9 (discussion 231): 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The iterative procedure consisted of three screening rounds that led to the selection of building blocks denoted as 4, 23, and 5 in positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively (supplemental Table S1). A schematic representation and the chemical structure of the selected tetrameric tripeptide, hereafter named 4-23-5, are reported in Fig. 1. Monomers 4, 23, and 5 refer to the amino acids d-glutamic acid (d-Glu), S-benzylated l-cysteine, and l-cyclohexylalanine. The selected peptide was readily resynthesized on a larger scale and purified by reverse phase HPLC. In the same ELISA assay, the purified 4-23-5 blocked the interaction of human PlGF with Flt-1 in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of about 10 ;m (Fig. 2A), whereas the control tetrameric peptides 21-1-5 and 4-23-A (supplemental Table S3) did not show any effect (Fig. 2A). Inhibitory Properties of the Peptide 4-23-5—Because the binding mechanism of VEGFs members able to recognize Flt-1 is similar (18Errico M. Riccioni T. Iyer S. Pisano C. Acharya K.R. Persico M.G.
