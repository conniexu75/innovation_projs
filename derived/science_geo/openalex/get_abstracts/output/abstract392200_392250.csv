https://openalex.org/W2110822964,"Background Greenhouse gas (GHG) production, as a cause of climate change, is considered as one of the biggest problems society is currently facing. The livestock sector is one of the large contributors of anthropogenic GHG emissions. Also, large amounts of ammonia (NH3), leading to soil nitrification and acidification, are produced by livestock. Therefore other sources of animal protein, like edible insects, are currently being considered. Methodology/Principal Findings An experiment was conducted to quantify production of carbon dioxide (CO2) and average daily gain (ADG) as a measure of feed conversion efficiency, and to quantify the production of the greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) as well as NH3 by five insect species of which the first three are considered edible: Tenebrio molitor, Acheta domesticus, Locusta migratoria, Pachnoda marginata, and Blaptica dubia. Large differences were found among the species regarding their production of CO2 and GHGs. The insects in this study had a higher relative growth rate and emitted comparable or lower amounts of GHG than described in literature for pigs and much lower amounts of GHG than cattle. The same was true for CO2 production per kg of metabolic weight and per kg of mass gain. Furthermore, also the production of NH3 by insects was lower than for conventional livestock. Conclusions/Significance This study therefore indicates that insects could serve as a more environmentally friendly alternative for the production of animal protein with respect to GHG and NH3 emissions. The results of this study can be used as basic information to compare the production of insects with conventional livestock by means of a life cycle analysis."

Nucleotide sequences for 24 representative human KIR haplotypes were determined. With three previously defined haplotypes, this gave a set of 12 group A and 15 group B haplotypes for assessment of KIR variation. The seven gene-content haplotypes are all combinations of four centromeric and two telomeric motifs. 2DL5, 2DS5 and 2DS3 can be present in centromeric and telomeric locations. With one exception, haplotypes having identical gene content differed in their combinations of KIR alleles. Sequence diversity varied between haplotype groups and between centromeric and telomeric halves of the KIR locus. The most variable A haplotype genes are in the telomeric half, whereas the most variable genes characterizing B haplotypes are in the centromeric half. Of the highly polymorphic genes, only the 3DL3 framework gene exhibits a similar diversity when carried by A and B haplotypes. Phylogenetic analysis and divergence time estimates, point to the centromeric gene-content motifs that distinguish A and B haplotypes having emerged ~6 million years ago, contemporaneously with the separation of human and chimpanzee ancestors. In contrast, the telomeric motifs that distinguish A and B haplotypes emerged more recently, ~1.7 million years ago, before the emergence of Homo sapiens. Thus the centromeric and telomeric motifs that typify A and B haplotypes have likely been present throughout human evolution. The results suggest the common ancestor of A and B haplotypes combined a B-like centromeric region with an A-like telomeric region."

Here, we identify novel potential epigenetic biomarkers of weight loss, comparing DNA methylation patterns of high and low responders to a hypocaloric diet. Twenty-five overweight or obese men participated in an 8-wk caloric restriction intervention. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and treated with bisulfite. The basal and endpoint epigenetic differences between high and low responders were analyzed by methylation microarray, which was also useful in comparing epigenetic changes due to the nutrition intervention. Subsequently, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to validate several relevant CpGs and the surrounding regions. DNA methylation levels in several CpGs located in the ATP10A and CD44 genes showed statistical baseline differences depending on the weight-loss outcome. At the treatment endpoint, DNA methylation levels of several CpGs on the WT1 promoter were statistically more methylated in the high than in the low responders. Finally, different CpG sites from WT1 and ATP10A were significantly modified as a result of the intervention. In summary, hypocaloricdiet-induced weight loss in humans could alter DNA methylation status of specific genes. Moreover, baseline DNA methylation patterns may be used as epigenetic markers that could help to predict weight loss.—Milagro, F. I., Campion, J., Cordero, P., Goyenechea, E., Gómez-Uriz, A.

https://openalex.org/W1982345208,"The Ca(2+)-binding protein of the EF-hand type, S100B, is abundantly expressed in and secreted by astrocytes, and release of S100B from damaged astrocytes occurs during the course of acute and chronic brain disorders. Thus, the concept has emerged that S100B might act an unconventional cytokine or a damage-associated molecular pattern protein playing a role in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders and inflammatory brain diseases. S100B proinflammatory effects require relatively high concentrations of the protein, whereas at physiological concentrations S100B exerts trophic effects on neurons. Most if not all of the extracellular (trophic and toxic) effects of S100B in the brain are mediated by the engagement of RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products). We show here that high S100B stimulates murine microglia migration in Boyden chambers via RAGE-dependent activation of Src kinase, Ras, PI3K, MEK/ERK1/2, RhoA/ROCK, Rac1/JNK/AP-1, Rac1/NF-κB, and, to a lesser extent, p38 MAPK. Recruitment of the adaptor protein, diaphanous-1, a member of the formin protein family, is also required for S100B/RAGE-induced migration of microglia. The S100B/RAGE-dependent activation of diaphanous-1/Rac1/JNK/AP-1, Ras/Rac1/NF-κB and Src/Ras/PI3K/RhoA/diaphanous-1 results in the up-regulation of expression of the chemokines, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL12, whose release and activity are required for S100B to stimulate microglia migration. Lastly, RAGE engagement by S100B in microglia results in up-regulation of the chemokine receptors, CCR1 and CCR5. These results suggests that S100B might participate in the pathophysiology of brain inflammatory disorders via RAGE-dependent regulation of several inflammation-related events including activation and migration of microglia."

The relationship between plasma levels of FGF-21 and coronary heart disease (CHD) in unknown.This study aimed to investigate the correlation of serum FGF-21 levels and lipid metabolism in the patients with coronary heart disease. We performed a logistic regression analysis of the relation between serum levels of FGF-21 and CHD patients with and without diabetes and hypertension. This study was conducted in the Departments of Endocrinology and Cardiovascular Diseases at two University Hospitals. Participants consisted of one hundred and thirty-five patients who have been diagnosed to have CHD and sixty-one control subjects. Serum FGF-21 level and levels of fasting blood glucose; triglyceride; apolipoprotein B100; HOMA-IR; insulin; total cholesterol; HDL-cholesterol; LDL-cholesterol; and C-reactive protein were measured. We found that median serum FGF-21 levels were significantly higher in CHD than that of control subjects (P<0.0001). Serum FGF-21 levels in CHD patients with diabetes, hypertension, or both were higher than that of patients without these comorbidities. Serum FGF-21 levels correlated positively with triglycerides, fasting blood glucose, apolipoprotein B100, insulin and HOMA-IR but negatively with HDL-C and apolipoprotein A1 after adjusting for BMI, diabetes and hypertension. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that FGF-21 showed an independent association with triglyceride and apolipoprotein A1.High levels of FGF-21 are associated with adverse lipid profiles in CHD patients. The paradoxical increase of serum FGF-21 in CHD patients may indicate a compensatory response or resistance to FGF-21."

Some of these cells continuously differentiate to myelin-forming oligodendrocytes; knowledge of the destiny of NG2+ precursors would benefit from the characterization of new key functional players. In this respect, the G protein-coupled membrane receptor GPR17 has recently emerged as a new timer of oligodendrogliogenesis. Here, we used purified oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) to fully define the immunophenotype of the GPR17-expressing cells during OPC differentiation, unveil its native signaling pathway, and assess the functional consequences of GPR17 activation by its putative endogenous ligands, uracil nucleotides and cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs). GPR17 presence was restricted to very early differentiation stages and completely segregated from that of mature myelin. Specifically, GPR17 decorated two subsets of slowly proliferating NG2+ OPCs: (i) morphologically immature cells expressing other early proteins like Olig2 and PDGF receptor-α, and (ii) ramified preoligodendrocytes already expressing more mature factors, like O4 and O1. Thus, GPR17 is a new marker of these transition stages. In OPCs, GPR17 activation by either uracil nucleotides or cysLTs resulted in potent inhibition of intracellular cAMP formation. This effect was counteracted by GPR17 antagonists and receptor silencing with siRNAs. Finally, uracil nucleotides promoted and GPR17 inhibition, by either antagonists or siRNAs, impaired the normal program of OPC differentiation. These data have implications for the in vivo behavior of NG2+ OPCs and point to uracil nucleotides and cysLTs as main extrinsic local regulators of these cells under physiological conditions and during myelin repair.

These cells (polydendrocytes), which are the majority of proliferating cells in the adult brain and spinal cord, actually represent a peculiar type of multifunctional cells because, under specific conditions, they can also give rise to neurons and astrocytes (1Nishiyama A. Komitova M. Suzuki R. Zhu X. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 10: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Moreover, lineage tracing studies indicate that some NG2+ cells in the mature brain cease proliferating and rarely, if ever, undergo differentiation (2Rivers L.E. Young K.M. Rizzi M. Jamen F. Psachoulia K. Wade A. Kessaris N. Richardson W.D. Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 1392-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Finally, some NG2+ cells might also generate action potentials (3De Biase L.M. Nishiyama A. Bergles D.E. J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 3600-3611Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and physically interact with axon terminals filled with synaptic vesicles, leading to the novel concept of neuron-polydendrocyte synapses. NG2+ cells thus represent a heterogeneous population of precursors whose complete characterization would benefit from the identification of new markers mapping specific functional/differentiation stages. In this respect, we recently identified the membrane G protein-coupled receptor GPR17 activated by uracil nucleotides (UDP-glucose and UDP) and cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs, like LTD4 and LTE4) (4Ciana P.

We have originally demonstrated that, in primary cortical neuron-glia cultures, GPR17 is expressed by OPCs together with typical preoligodendroglial markers like NG2 and O4 (8Lecca D.

Both in vivo and in vitro, co-localization of GPR17 with markers of mature myelinating oligodendrocytes (e.g. myelin basic protein (MBP)) was found to a very small extent (8Lecca D. Trincavelli M.L.

Important from a functional point of view, we also originally showed that the pharmacological manipulation of GPR17 with its ligands fosters the progression of preoligodendrocytes toward mature myelinating cells (8Lecca D.

Accordingly, GPR17-forced overexpression inhibits OPC differentiation and maturation, and, conversely, GPR17 knock-out mice show precocious onset of myelination (10Chen Y. Wu H. Wang S. Koito H.

The relatively low number of OPCs (∼5–10%) in the previously utilized neuronal-glia cultures (8Lecca D. Trincavelli M.L. Gelosa P. Sironi L. Ciana P. Fumagalli M. Villa G. Verderio C. Grumelli C.

PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3579Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) has hampered the functional characterization of GPR17 and of its signaling. On this basis, the present study was undertaken on purified OPCs from rat cortex to characterize GPR17 expression during spontaneous in vitro differentiation, to define fully the immunophenotype of GPR17-expressing cells and to unveil the signaling pathways of the native receptor. We show that GPR17 identifies two distinct stages of slowly proliferating NG2+ cells. We also provide strong evidence indicating inhibition of cAMP as the main signaling pathway of native GPR17 upon activation by its endogenous ligands. Finally, we provide pharmacological and gene silencing data to establish a mechanistic role of GPR17 in OPC differentiation. OPCs were isolated from mixed glial cultures from embryonic day 19 or postnatal day 2 Sprague-Dawley rat cortex, by the shaking method, as described (12Stevens B. Porta S. Haak L.L. Gallo V.

The quality of RNA samples was assessed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). One μg of total RNA was used for semiquantitative real-time RT-PCR (AMV first-strand cDNA Synthesis kit and Faststart DNA Master SYBR Green 1 PCR mix; Roche Diagnostics), with the following primers: GPR17 forward, CTGCTACCTGCTGATCATTCG and reverse, TAGACTGAACGGTGGATGTGG; MPB forward, CGATTGGGTGTCACTCCGAAA and reverse, CCCAGCAGAGAATGAACACAA; PLP1 forward, AAGTCGCAGAGGAATGAAAGC and reverse, AAGGACATTCCTGCTTTCTACC; GAPDH forward, AATGCATCCTGCACCACCAAC and reverse, TGGATGCAGGGATGTTCTG. Data analysis was performed using LightCycler software (Roche Diagnostics) with quantification and melting curve options. The acquired fluorescence signal was quantified by the second derivative maximum method using LightCycler data analysis software to obtain crossing point values (Cp) and PCR efficiency (E). Changes in concentration of the amplified target were detected as differences in threshold cycle (ΔCp) between samples; relative expression ratio (R) of target genes were calculated based on E and ΔCP and expressed as a ratio to the reference housekeeping gene GAPDH.

The following primers were also utilized: rat Olig2 forward, 5′-TCCTCCAGCACCTCCTCGTC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GTGACCCCCGTAAATCTCGC-3′ (Ta, 59.8 °C; PCR product, 306 bp); rat PDGF receptor-α (PDGFRα) forward, 5′-GGAAATCAGAACCGAGGAG-3′ and reverse, 5′-CAGTTTGATGGACGGGAGT-3′ (Ta, 55.9 °C; PCR product, 306 bp). Primers used for two splicing forms of PLP1, PLP and DM-20, were forward, 5′-GAAAAGTTAATTGAGACCTA-3′ and reverse, 5′-TACCAGGGAAACTAGTGTGG-3′ (Ta, 57 °C; PCR products, two bands of 532 and 637 bp representing DM-20 and PLP transcripts, respectively). Twenty-microliter aliquots of the PCR products were size separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel. To check GPR17 knock-down after silencing experiments, total RNA from control and silenced postnatal OPCs was extracted with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Retrotranscriptions to cDNA and PCR reactions were carried out as described (8Lecca D. Trincavelli M.L. Gelosa P. Sironi L. Ciana P. Fumagalli M. Villa G. Verderio C. Grumelli C. Guerrini U.

After 3–4 days in culture, cells in proliferating medium were transfected with a siRNA specifically designed for silencing rat GPR17 (Qiagen, Milan, Italy): CCGTATAGAGAAGCACCTCAA (target sequence). The sequence was designed to minimize homology to any known vertebrate transcript and did not induce the interferon-mediated stress response pathways, according to the manufacturer's specifications. This sequence has been already successfully utilized to knock-down GPR17 specifically (6Daniele S. Lecca D. Trincavelli M.L. Ciampi O. Abbracchio M.P. Martini C. Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In parallel, an ineffective randomly designed RNA sequence was used as negative control (Qiagen). In the present study, to prove a role for GPR17 in cAMP regulation, siRNAs were transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) as described (6Daniele S. Lecca D. Trincavelli M.L. Ciampi O. Abbracchio M.P. Martini C. Cell. Signal. 2010; 22: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) to a final concentration of 100 nm/well (24-well cell culture plate), following the manufacturer's protocol. Preliminary experiments with graded siRNA concentrations were performed to choose the optimal conditions for silencing. GPR17 knock-down was checked by RT-PCR analysis and immunocytochemistry. Measurement of cyclic AMP levels in OPCs was evaluated 48–72 h after siRNA transfection. To prove a role for GPR17 in OPC differentiation, cells were maintained in differentiating medium supplemented with T3 and after 3–4 days in culture transfected with siRNA as described above. Immunocytochemical analysis was performed 72 h after RNA interference. Intracellular cAMP levels were measured using a competitive protein binding method as reported (17Trincavelli M.L. Tonazzini I.

Briefly, purified OPCs were seeded on poly-d,l-ornithine 24-well plates (1.5 × 104 cells/well) in 0.5 ml of medium and maintained in culture for 6–7 days (peak of GPR17 expression). For the assay, the complete medium was removed, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with 0.4 ml of medium in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro20-1724 (20 μm). The concentration-response curve of tested ligands was evaluated by assessing their ability to inhibit cAMP accumulation stimulated by 10 μm forskolin. Agonists were added to cells for 15 min. When required, cells were preincubated for 10 min with antagonists. Reactions were terminated by medium removal and addition of 200 μl of 0.4 n HCl. After 30 min, lysates were neutralized with 50 μl of 4 n KOH, and the suspension was centrifuged at 800 × g for 5 min. For determination of cAMP, cAMP-binding protein isolated from bovine adrenal glands was incubated with [3H]cAMP (2 nm), 50 μl of cell lysate or cAMP standard (0–16 pmol) at 4 °C for 150 min, in a total volume of 300 μl. Bound radioactivity was separated by rapid filtration through GF/C glass fiber filters and washed twice with 4 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The following pharmacological agents were tested: UDP, UDP-glucose (Sigma-Aldrich), LTD4 and LTE4 (Cayman Europe). Montelukast was a gift from Merck, and cangrelor was a gift from The Medicines Company (Parsippany, NJ). At day 5, the GPR17 antagonist cangrelor (10 μm) or the agonist UDP-glucose (100 μm) were added to OPCs in differentiating medium containing T3. After 48 h, cells were fixed and immunostained with anti-GPR17, anti-MBP, and anti-CNPase antibodies as described above. In a set of experiments, at day 3, OPCs cultured in differentiating medium containing T3 were transfected with siRNA as described and after 48 h, exposed to UDP-glucose (100 μm) for an additional 48 h. Cells were then fixed to determine their differentiation stage by immunocytochemistry. For cAMP data, a nonlinear multipurpose curve-fitting program Graph-Pad Prism was used. Data are reported as mean ± S.E. of three/four different experiments (performed in duplicate). For all other experiments, Graph-Pad Prism was also used (see legends of FIGURE 8, FIGURE 9 for details). As a first step, we analyzed the induction of GPR17 mRNA compared with the mRNAs of some major myelin proteins, such as MBP and PLP1 during the process of spontaneous in vitro differentiation. Real-time PCR analysis showed that GPR17 mRNA was expressed at low levels at early differentiation stages (∼after 2–3 days in culture), whereas it was sharply increased immediately afterward, reaching a maximum peak around day 6, when the mRNA levels of MBP started to increase. As OPC differentiation proceeded, GPR17 mRNA progressively declined, reaching its lowest level at 14 days in culture, when, conversely, PLP1 expression reached its maximum (Fig. 1A). These expression changes were paralleled by gradual morphological changes in culture, from a very simple bipolar shape to an increasingly complex ramified morphology (see also below and Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Scheme showing GPR17 expression as a function of OPC differentiation. The drawing illustrates the typical differentiation steps of OPCs, from the immature precursor to mature oligodendrocyte. Tables summarize single-cells RT-PCR (mRNA) and immunocytochemical (protein) data for GPR17 and other already known markers identifying specific differentiation stages. GPR17 can be considered as a novel lineage marker that recognizes two subsets of NG2+ cells (polydendrocytes) and pre/immature oligodendrocytes. At early stage (stage 1), bipolar OPCs already express GPR17 mRNA, but receptor protein expression is detectable only when NG2+ cells acquire a more complex morphology (stage 2, polydendrocyte stage). After this stage, GPR17 gradually increases in pre/immature oligodendrocytes, reaching a maximum peak when O4 is expressed (stage 3). GPR17 expression is then turned down, and mature MBP+ cells no longer express the receptor (stage 4). The graded changes of the GPR17 protein during differentiation are highlighted in a yellow-orange-red triangle, where orange represents the maximum expression level. N.D., not done.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To obtain more information on the expression pattern of other OPC markers in the GPR17-expressing cells, we examined genes encoding for PDGFRα, a typical marker of early OPCs, and for the two splicing variant forms of PLP1: DM-20, the predominant immature isoform during early OPC development, and the myelin protein PLP, which is instead expressed by more mature OPCs. To this purpose, at different days in culture corresponding to distinct maturation stages (stages 1–4, see Fig. 1B and Fig. 3), single-cell PCR was applied to pools of bipolar, tripolar, or ramified oligodendrocytes (2–5 cells/pool) picked up from living cultures using cell morphology at the light microscope as a guide. We found that bipolar cells at day 2 in culture (stage 1) co-expressed the mRNAs for GPR17, the immature marker PDGFRα, and the more immature PLP splicing variant DM-20. Tripolar cells at day 4 in culture (stage 2) maintained the same gene expression pattern. At day 6 (stage 3), ramified preoligodendrocytes instead co-expressed GPR17 mRNA together with the mRNAs for both PLP and DM-20 myelin proteins, whereas they no longer expressed PDGFRα mRNA (Fig. 1B). At this stage, virtually all ramified ce"
https://openalex.org/W2012626012,"The widely studied and invasive earthworm, Lumbricus terrestris L., 1758 has been the subject of nomenclatural debate for many years. However these disputes were not based on suspicions of heterogeneity, but rather on the descriptions and nomenclatural acts associated with the species name. Large numbers of DNA barcode sequences of the cytochrome oxidase I obtained for nominal L. terrestris and six congeneric species reveal that there are two distinct lineages within nominal L. terrestris. One of those lineages contains the Swedish population from which the name-bearing specimen of L. terrestris was obtained. The other contains the population from which the syntype series of Enterion herculeum Savigny, 1826 was collected. In both cases modern and old representatives yielded barcode sequences allowing us to clearly establish that these are two distinct species, as different from one another as any other pair of congeners in our data set. The two are morphologically indistinguishable, except by overlapping size-related characters. We have designated a new neotype for L. terrestris. The newly designated neotype and a syntype of L. herculeus yielded DNA adequate for sequencing part of the cytochrome oxidase I gene (COI). The sequence data make possible the objective determination of the identities of earthworms morphologically identical to L. terrestris and L. herculeus, regardless of body size and segment number. Past work on nominal L. terrestris could have been on either or both species, although L. herculeus has yet to be found outside of Europe."
https://openalex.org/W2166606947,"Biodiverse coastal zones are often areas of intense fishing pressure due to the high relative density of fishing capacity in these nearshore regions. Although overcapacity is one of the central challenges to fisheries sustainability in coastal zones, accurate estimates of fishing pressure in coastal zones are limited, hampering the assessment of the direct and collateral impacts (e.g., habitat degradation, bycatch) of fishing. We compiled a comprehensive database of fishing effort metrics and the corresponding spatial limits of fisheries and used a spatial analysis program (FEET) to map fishing effort density (measured as boat-meters per km2) in the coastal zones of six ocean regions. We also considered the utility of a number of socioeconomic variables as indicators of fishing pressure at the national level; fishing density increased as a function of population size and decreased as a function of coastline length. Our mapping exercise points to intra and interregional ‘hotspots’ of coastal fishing pressure. The significant and intuitive relationships we found between fishing density and population size and coastline length may help with coarse regional characterizations of fishing pressure. However, spatially-delimited fishing effort data are needed to accurately map fishing hotspots, i.e., areas of intense fishing activity. We suggest that estimates of fishing effort, not just target catch or yield, serve as a necessary measure of fishing activity, which is a key link to evaluating sustainability and environmental impacts of coastal fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W1971849205,"Prion diseases are infectious neurodegenerative disorders that affect humans and animals and that result from the conversion of normal prion protein (PrPC) into the misfolded prion protein (PrPSc). Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disorder of increasing prevalence within the United States that affects a large population of wild and captive deer and elk. Determining the risk of transmission of CWD to humans is of utmost importance, considering that people can be infected by animal prions, resulting in new fatal diseases. To study the possibility that human PrPC can be converted into the misfolded form by CWD PrPSc, we performed experiments using the protein misfolding cyclic amplification technique, which mimics in vitro the process of prion replication. Our results show that cervid PrPSc can induce the conversion of human PrPC but only after the CWD prion strain has been stabilized by successive passages in vitro or in vivo. Interestingly, the newly generated human PrPSc exhibits a distinct biochemical pattern that differs from that of any of the currently known forms of human PrPSc. Our results also have profound implications for understanding the mechanisms of the prion species barrier and indicate that the transmission barrier is a dynamic process that depends on the strain and moreover the degree of adaptation of the strain.

Chronic wasting disease (CWD) 2The abbreviations used are: CWD, chronic wasting disease; CJD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; PMCA, protein misfolding cyclic amplification; BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy; PK, proteinase K. is a disorder associated with infectious prions that affects deer, elk, and moose (1Miller M.W.

CWD is so far the only prion disease of wild animals; it is highly contagious, and the exact prevalence is currently unknown. Its origin and mechanism of transmission are also unclear. CWD-affected animals show loss of body condition, changes in behavior, ataxia, head tremors, salivation, and somnolence (1Miller M.W. Williams E.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 284: 193-214PubMed Google Scholar). CWD can reduce the growth and size of wild deer and elk populations in areas where the prevalence is high and is of increasing concern in North America. The disease was thought to be limited in the wild to a relatively small endemic area in northeastern Colorado and southeastern Wyoming. However, in the last decade, it has spread east and west of those areas, even across natural borders, and has been reported in 14 states, two Canadian provinces, and South Korea (1Miller M.W. Williams E.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 284: 193-214PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sigurdson C.J. Aguzzi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1772: 610-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The risk of transmission of CWD to other animal species and especially to humans is unknown. Defining that risk is of utmost importance, considering that transmission of bovine prions to humans resulted in a new disease (variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)) and that the number of cervids affected by CWD in the United States is increasing (3Bosque P.J. Curr. Neurol. Neurosci. Rep. 2002; 2: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Transmission of prions between different species of mammals is often limited by the species barrier phenomenon (4Moore R.A. Vorberg I. Priola S.A. Arch. Virol. Suppl. 2005; 19: 187-202Google Scholar). Currently, the strength of the barrier between different species is unpredictable and requires bioassay studies to be assessed. These experiments are costly and time-consuming and, in the case of humans, cannot be measured directly but rely on the use of animal models, such as transgenic mice and primates. It is presumed that a large number of hunters in the United States have been in contact with or consumed CWD-infected meat (5Belay E.D. Gambetti P. Schonberger L.B. Parchi P. Lyon D.R. Capellari S.

To test the possibility that human PrPC can be converted into the infectious form by CWD PrPSc, we performed experiments using the protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) technique. PMCA mimics prion replication in vitro at an accelerated speed (12Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C.

These findings demonstrate that PMCA is a valuable tool to investigate the strength of the barrier between diverse species, its molecular determinants, and the expected features of the new infectious material produced. Brains from healthy transgenic mice overexpressing either human PrP (129M genotype) (18Telling G.C. Scott M. Mastrianni J. Gabizon R. Torchia M. Cohen F.E. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B.

As inoculum for the PMCA reaction, we used brains from different naturally affected CWD mule deer, cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), sheep with scrapie, humans affected with diverse forms of CJD, or Tg1536 mice infected with CWD prions. 10% (w/v) brain homogenates were prepared in conversion buffer (PBS containing 150 mm NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, and CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Aliquots (100 μl) of 10% healthy brain homogenate were loaded onto 0.2-ml PCR tubes. Tubes were positioned on an adaptor placed on the plate holder of a microsonicator (Misonix Model 4000), programmed to perform 144 cycles of 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, followed by a 20-s pulse of sonication set at an amplitude of 70. For serial PMCA, after each round of cycles, a 10-μl aliquot of the amplified material was diluted into 90 μl of normal brain homogenate, and a new round of PMCA cycles was performed. In some experiments, 0.05% digitonin and 4 mm EDTA were added to the conversion buffer. The detailed protocol for PMCA, including reagents, solutions and troubleshooting, has been published previously (20Castilla J. Saá P. Morales R. Abid K. Maundrell K. Soto C. Methods Enzymol. 2006; 412: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 21Saá P. Castilla J. Soto C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2005; 299: 53-65PubMed Google Scholar). The standard procedure to digest PrPSc consists of subjecting samples to incubation in the presence of proteinase K (PK; 50 μg/ml) for 60 min with shaking at 37 °C. The digestion was stopped by the addition of electrophoresis sample buffer, and protease-resistant PrP was revealed by Western blotting. Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with antibody 6D11 (1:5000 dilution) to recognize cervid, cattle, or sheep PrP proteins or with antibody 3F4 (1:10,000 dilution) to detect exclusively human PrP. The immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence assay (Amersham Biosciences) using a UVP image analysis system. Having validated the PMCA technology to assess the species barrier in vitro (16Green K.M. Castilla J. Seward T.S. Napier D.L. Jewell J.E. Soto C. Telling G.C. PLoS Pathog. 2008; 4: e1000139Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 17Castilla J. Gonzalez-Romero D. Saá P. Morales R. De Castro J. Soto C. Cell. 2008; 134: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), we investigated the possibility that CWD PrPSc can convert human PrPC to PrPSc. Standard PMCA using samples from three different CWD brains failed to produce a signal for human PrPSc (Fig. 1A). For these studies, we took advantage of the fact that human (but not deer) PrP is detectable with antibody 3F4 (22Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so any PK-resistant signal detectable with this antibody corresponds to human PrPSc material. To further attempt the generation of human PrPSc from deer, we performed several rounds of PMCA, a process that has been shown to dramatically increase the amplification efficiency (23Castilla J. Saá P. Soto C. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 982-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 24Saá P. Castilla J. Soto C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35245-35252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, no human PrPSc signal was detectable even after three rounds of PMCA. Importantly, the same CWD inoculum efficiently induced the conversion of deer PrPC into PrPSc (Fig. 1C). We used brains of transgenic mice expressing human PrPC as the substrate under conditions that were previously shown to efficiently propagate human PrPSc from various forms of sporadic and variant CJD (see also supplemental Fig. 1) (14Castilla J. Morales R. Saá P. Barria M. Gambetti P. Soto C. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 2557-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To further attempt conversion of human PrPC by deer PrPSc, we added 0.05% digitonin and 4 mm EDTA to the conversion buffer, which we have found to increase the efficiency of PMCA amplification in human samples (supplemental Fig. 1). However, these conditions were unsuccessful in generating PK-resistant human PrPSc (Fig. 1D). In our previous experiments to cross the mouse-hamster species barrier by PMCA, we found that adding a more concentrated solution of the PrPSc inoculum was successful in producing interspecies conversion (17Castilla J. Gonzalez-Romero D. Saá P. Morales R. De Castro J. Soto C. Cell. 2008; 134: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To evaluate this possibility, we used more concentrated CWD material (from 2- to 0.2-fold) as inoculum. Again, no human PrPSc product was observed under these conditions (Fig. 1E). The conclusion from these experiments is that either the deer-human barrier is absolute or the PMCA conditions were not optimal to cross it. In a previous study, Hoover and co-workers (25Kurt T.D. Telling G.C. Zabel M.D. Hoover E.A. Virology. 2009; 387: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were also unable to replicate CWD PrPSc at the expense of human PrPC in serial PMCA experiments. On the basis of our previous studies, we noted that PMCA not only enables interspecies conversion but also allows adaptation of the new strain generated (17Castilla J. Gonzalez-Romero D. Saá P. Morales R. De Castro J. Soto C. Cell. 2008; 134: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Indeed, a recent study showed that serial rounds of PMCA produce the same adaptation of a natural CWD prion strain as do serial passages in vivo (26Meyerett C. Michel B. Pulford B. Spraker T.R.

Because the CWD prions used in our experiments are derived from naturally affected mule deer, we hypothesized that the CWD strain most likely corresponds to an unstable prion strain. To assess whether strain adaptation by serial PMCA rounds might influence the ability of CWD prions to cross the human species barrier, we performed several passages of CWD PrPSc into deer PrPC by PMCA (Fig. 2A). For this experiment, six replicate experiments were performed in parallel. Interestingly, after one PMCA round, the deer PrPSc produced was able to convert human PrPC with low efficiency (Fig. 2B, upper panel). One of the six replicates showed a clear protease-resistant band with a molecular weight reminiscent of PrP27–30. Two or three other replicates showed faint immunoreactive bands (Fig. 2B, upper panel). Moreover, after a second and third passage of CWD PrPSc into deer PrPC, a much more clear and efficient conversion of human PrPC to PrPSc was observed (Fig. 2B, middle and lower panels). These results suggest that CWD prions might be able to affect human beings but only after the CWD strain has been stabilized by successive passaging. To further test this hypothesis and to determine that the ability to convert human PrP was not an artifact produced by in vitro PMCA amplification, we tested samples of CWD that were serially passaged in transgenic mice expressing cervid PrPC. Samples from the first and second passages in vivo in mice from two different inocula were used to trigger conversion of human PrPC. As shown in Fig. 3, cervid PrPSc obtained from these two inocula, after either one or two passages in transgenic mice, was able to convert human PrPC into PK-resistant human PrPSc.FIGURE 3Conversion of human PrPC induced by CWD PrPSc after in vivo strain adaptation. Transgenic (Tg) mice expressing the cervid PrP gene were used to serially passage CWD prions from two different natural inocula (Inoc). Brain homogenate from sick transgenic mice after one or two in vivo passages was used to convert human PrPC by subjecting the sample to 144 PMCA cycles. The generation of human PrPSc after PMCA was assessed by Western blotting employing antibody 3F4 (right panel). The PrPSc reactivity of the CWD inoculum from cervid transgenic mice was evaluated by Western blotting using antibody 6D11 (left panel). All samples were digested with PK (50 μg/ml), except for the normal brain homogenate (NBH No PK), which was used as a marker of full-length PrPC electrophoretic migration. The asterisk represents incomplete digestion of PrPC. As shown before, amplification of the original CWD inoculum at the expense of human PrPC failed to show any PK-resistant PrPSc band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interestingly, when the Western blot profile of this newly generated form of human PrPSc (termed CWD-huPrPSc) was compared with those of known strains of human prions, it was clear that CWD-huPrPSc exhibited a different pattern (Fig. 4A). The electrophoretic migration of this protein after PK digestion is similar to that of the type 1 strain of sporadic CJD, but its glycosylation profile is clearly different, showing a highly predominant diglycosylated form (Fig. 4, A and B). This result suggests that CWD-huPrPSc corresponds to a new human prion strain. Interestingly, a detailed previous study by Chen and co-workers (6Xie Z. O'Rourke K.I. Dong Z. Jenny A.L. Langenberg J.A. Belay E.D. Schonberger L.B. Petersen R.B. Zou W. Kong Q. Gambetti P. Chen S.G. J. Biol.

However, the misfolded protein associated with CWD is predominantly diglycosylated, whereas PrPSc from type 1 sporadic CJD is mostly monoglycosylated (6Xie Z. O'Rourke K.I. Dong Z. Jenny A.L. Langenberg J.A. Belay E.D. Schonberger L.B. Petersen R.B. Zou W. Kong Q. Gambetti P. Chen S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4199-4206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). On the basis of the fact that transmission of BSE prions to humans resulted in a new form of PrPSc very similar to the one in cattle (6Xie Z. O'Rourke K.I. Dong Z. Jenny A.L. Langenberg J.A.

Nature. 1996; 383: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar), these authors predicted that if humans were infected by CWD, it is likely that PrPSc would be type 1, with a predominance of the diglycosylated isoform (6Xie Z.

Our results agree with that prediction and suggest that the newly generated CWD-huPrPSc acquires the biochemical properties of the cervid infectious material (Fig. 4, A and B). We and others have shown that PMCA replication of PrPSc obtained from experimental rodents, sheep, cervid, and human samples faithfully maintains the prion strain characteristics (14Castilla J.

To further support the relevance of our results, we performed experiments in which we attempted to convert human PrPC by either cattle BSE PrPSc or sheep scrapie PrPSc. Whereas the typical variant CJD type of PrPSc was generated when human PrPC was converted by BSE PrPSc, no human PrPSc was generated under any condition when sheep scrapie PrPSc was used as inoculum (Fig. 4B). These results further validate our PMCA assay. CWD is possibly the most worrisome prion zoonosis because it affects free-ranging animals, making it very difficult to control its spread, and because it is highly efficiently transmitted (1Miller M.W. Williams E.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 284: 193-214PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sigurdson C.J. Aguzzi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1772: 610-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Indeed, in dense free-ranging cervid populations, CWD prevalence can reach as high as 30%, and among captive herds, the prevalence can climb to nearly 100%. The mechanisms and routes of transmission are currently unknown but likely involve horizontal spread through exposure to prion-infected secretions, excretions, or decomposed carcasses (1Miller M.W. Williams E.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2004; 284: 193-214PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sigurdson C.J. Aguzzi A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1772: 610-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is likely that CWD prions are progressively accumulating in the environment because PrPSc binds tightly to soil and can maintain infectivity for a long time (31Seidel B. Thomzig A. Buschmann A. Groschup M.H. Peters R. Beekes M. Terytze K. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e435Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 32Brown P. Gajdusek D.C.

PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: e93Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Currently, it is unknown what proportion of natural CWD cases arises sporadically or comes from horizontal transmission among animals. Based on the available knowledge of the emergence, adaptation, and stabilization of prion strains, it is likely that prions appear either spontaneously, through interspecies transmission, or by genetic mutations. These “first generation” prions are unstable strains that begin a progressive and gradual process of adaptation that may take several passages and years or decades to complete. In addition, natural strain stabilization may take considerably more time than the controlled adaptation done by intracerebral inoculation of brain homogenates in experimental animals. In natural cases, animals usually get infected by peripheral (most likely oral) exposure to small quantities of prions present in peripheral tissues or secretion fluids. Recent data indicate that, in some cases, the strain characteristics of natural prions in peripheral organs are different from those in the brain even in the same individuals. 3G. C. Telling, unpublished data. , 4M. A. Barria and C. Soto, unpublished data. In cervids, there are at least two different strains that can be differentiated by the incubation time and neuropathological characteristics produced when inoculated into transgenic mice expressing deer PrP (34Angers R.C. Kang H.E. Napier D. Browning S. Seward T. Mathiason C. Balachandran A. McKenzie D. Castilla J. Soto C. Jewell J. Graham C. Hoover E.A. Telling G.C. Science. 2010; 328: 1154-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The susceptibility of these two strains to human transmission is currently unknown. Our findings demonstrate that upon strain adaptation by serial passages in vitro or in cervid transgenic mice, cervid PrPSc is capable of converting human PrPC to produce PrPSc with unique biochemical properties, likely representing a new human prion strain. The newly generated CWD-huPrPSc material has been inoculated into transgenic mice expressing human PrP to study infectivity and disease phenotype, and these data will be published elsewhere. It is highly unlikely that the human PrPSc generated in these studies is coming from spontaneous “de novo generation” because, under the conditions used, no spontaneous PK-resistant band was detected in brain homogenates of humans or transgenic mice expressing human PrPC, even after >20 serial rounds of PMCA (35Barria M.A. Mukherjee A. Gonzalez-Romero D. Morales R. Soto C. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000421Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, none of the many controls included in our experiments in which no PrPSc was added to the reaction showed any PK-resistant PrP band. Analyses of the transmission of CWD to transgenic mice expressing human PrP have consistently given negative results (9Kong Q. Huang S. Zou W. Vanegas D. Wang M. Wu D. Yuan J. Zheng M. Bai H. Deng H.

This conclusion is consistent with our many failed attempts to convert human PrPC with natural CWD, even after pushing the PMCA conditions (see Fig. 1). We found successful conversion only after adaptation of the CWD prion strain by successive passages in vitro or in cervid transgenic mice. We are not aware that the inoculum used in any of the transgenic mice studies was a previously stabilized CWD strain. Although it has been shown that strain stabilization in vitro by PMCA (17Castilla J. Gonzalez-Romero D. Saá P. Morales R. De Castro J. Soto C. Cell. 2008; 134: 757-768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 26Meyerett C. Michel B. Pulford B. Spraker T.R. Nichols T.A. Johnson T. Kurt T. Hoover E.A. Telling G.C.

Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: S166-S170Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) has similarities to the strain adaptation process occurring in natural hosts, we cannot rule out that the type of CWD strain adaptation that is required to produce strains transmissible to humans may take much longer time in cervids or not occur at all. An important experiment will be to study transmissibility to humanized transgenic mice of CWD passaged experimentally in deer several times. Besides the importance of our results for public health in relation to the putative transmissibility of CWD to humans, our data also illustrate a very important and novel scientific concept related to the mechanism of prion transmission across species barriers. Today, the view is that the species barrier is controlled mostly by the degree of similarity of the sequence of the prion protein between the host and the infectious material (4Moore R.A. Vorberg I. Priola S.A. Arch. Virol. Suppl. 2005; 19: 187-202Google Scholar). In our study, we have shown that the strain and, moreover, the stabilization of the strain play a major role in the interspecies transmission. In our system, there is no change in the protein sequence, yet strain adaptation results in a complete change in prion transmissibility with potentially dramatic consequences. Therefore, our findings lead to a new view of the species barrier that should not be seen as a static process but rather a dynamic biological phenomenon that can change over time when prion strains mature and evolve. It remains to be investigated whether other species barriers also change upon progressive strain adaptation of other prion forms (e.g. the sheep-human barrier). Our results have far-reaching implications for human health because they indicate that cervid PrPSc can trigger the conversion of human PrPC into PrPSc, suggesting that CWD might be infectious to humans. Interestingly, our findings suggest that unstable strains from CWD-affected animals might not be a problem for humans, but upon strain stabilization by successive passages in the wild, this disease might become progressively more transmissible to man.

A common experimental procedure to determine nucleosome positions involves the use of micrococcal nuclease (MNase). Here, we show that the cutting preference of MNase in combination with size selection generates a sequence-dependent bias in the resulting fragments. This strongly affects nucleosome positioning data and especially sequence-dependent models for nucleosome positioning. As a consequence we see a need to re-evaluate whether the DNA sequence is a major determinant of nucleosome positioning in vivo. More generally, our results show that data generated after MNase digestion of chromatin requires a matched control experiment in order to determine nucleosome positions."
https://openalex.org/W1971876285,"To compensate for the energetic deficit elicited by reduced carbohydrate intake, mammals convert energy stored in ketone bodies to high energy phosphates. Ketone bodies provide fuel particularly to brain, heart, and skeletal muscle in states that include starvation, adherence to low carbohydrate diets, and the neonatal period. Here, we use novel Oxct1(-/-) mice, which lack the ketolytic enzyme succinyl-CoA:3-oxo-acid CoA-transferase (SCOT), to demonstrate that ketone body oxidation is required for postnatal survival in mice. Although Oxct1(-/-) mice exhibit normal prenatal development, all develop ketoacidosis, hypoglycemia, and reduced plasma lactate concentrations within the first 48 h of birth. In vivo oxidation of (13)C-labeled β-hydroxybutyrate in neonatal Oxct1(-/-) mice, measured using NMR, reveals intact oxidation to acetoacetate but no contribution of ketone bodies to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Accumulation of acetoacetate yields a markedly reduced β-hydroxybutyrate:acetoacetate ratio of 1:3, compared with 3:1 in Oxct1(+) littermates. Frequent exogenous glucose administration to actively suckling Oxct1(-/-) mice delayed, but could not prevent, lethality. Brains of newborn SCOT-deficient mice demonstrate evidence of adaptive energy acquisition, with increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase α, increased autophagy, and 2.4-fold increased in vivo oxidative metabolism of [(13)C]glucose. Furthermore, [(13)C]lactate oxidation is increased 1.7-fold in skeletal muscle of Oxct1(-/-) mice but not in brain. These results indicate the critical metabolic roles of ketone bodies in neonatal metabolism and suggest that distinct tissues exhibit specific metabolic responses to loss of ketone body oxidation."

This highlights the potentially important, but uncharacterized, role of miRNAs during early spermatogenesis. The goal of this study was to characterize on postnatal day 7, 10, and 14 the content and editing of murine testicular miRNAs, which predominantly arise from spermatogonia and spermatocytes, in contrast to prior descriptions of miRNAs in the adult mouse testis which largely reflects the content of spermatids. Previous studies have shown miRNAs to be abundant in the mouse testis by postnatal day 14; however, through Next Generation Sequencing of testes from a B6;129 background we found abundant earlier expression of miRNAs and describe shifts in the miRNA signature during this period. We detected robust expression of miRNAs encoded on the X chromosome in postnatal day 14 testes, consistent with prior studies showing their resistance to meiotic sex chromosome inactivation. Unexpectedly, we also found a similar positional enrichment for most miRNAs on chromosome 2 at postnatal day 14 and for those on chromosome 12 at postnatal day 7. We quantified in vivo developmental changes in three types of miRNA variation including 5′ heterogeneity, editing, and 3′ nucleotide addition. We identified eleven putative novel pubertal testis miRNAs whose developmental expression suggests a possible role in early male germ cell development. These studies provide a foundation for interpretation of miRNA changes associated with testicular pathology and identification of novel components of the miRNA editing machinery in the testis."

In correlative studies the impact of sorafenib on cyclin D1 and Ki67 was assessed. Methodology/Principal Findings Thirty-six patients treatment-naïve advanced melanoma patients received sorafenib 400 mg p.o. twice daily continuously. Tumor BRAFV600E mutational status was determined by routine DNA sequencing and mutation-specific PCR (MSPCR). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for cyclin D1 and Ki67 was performed on available pre- and post treatment tumor samples. The main toxicities included diarrhea, alopecia, rash, mucositis, nausea, hand-foot syndrome, and intestinal perforation. One patient had a RECIST partial response (PR) lasting 175 days. Three patients experienced stable disease (SD) with a mean duration of 37 weeks. Routine BRAFV600E sequencing yielded 27 wild-type (wt) and 6 mutant tumors, whereas MSPCR identified 12 wt and 18 mutant tumors. No correlation was seen between BRAFV600E mutational status and clinical activity. No significant changes in expression of cyclin D1 or Ki67 with sorafenib treatment were demonstrable in the 15 patients with pre-and post-treatment tumor samples. Conclusions/Significance Sorafenib monotherapy has limited activity in advanced melanoma patients. BRAFV600E mutational status of the tumor was not associated with clinical activity and no significant effect of sorafenib on cyclin D1 or Ki67 was seen, suggesting that sorafenib is not an effective BRAF inhibitor or that additional signaling pathways are equally important in the patients who benefit from sorafenib.

https://openalex.org/W2122123587,"Background Animal models of human behavioral endophenotypes, such as the Tail Suspension Test (TST) and the Open Field assay (OF), have proven to be essential tools in revealing the genetics and mechanisms of psychiatric diseases. As in the human disorders they model, the measurements generated in these behavioral assays are significantly impacted by the genetic background of the animals tested. In order to better understand the strain-dependent phenotypic variability endemic to this type of work, and better inform future studies that rely on the data generated by these models, we phenotyped 33 inbred mouse strains for immobility in the TST, a mouse model of behavioral despair, and for activity in the OF, a model of general anxiety and locomotor activity. Results We identified significant strain-dependent differences in TST immobility, and in thigmotaxis and distance traveled in the OF. These results were replicable over multiple testing sessions and exhibited high heritability. We exploited the heritability of these behavioral traits by using in silico haplotype-based association mapping to identify candidate genes for regulating TST behavior. Two significant loci (-logp >7.0, gFWER adjusted p value <0.05) of approximately 300 kb each on MMU9 and MMU10 were identified. The MMU10 locus is syntenic to a major human depressive disorder QTL on human chromosome 12 and contains several genes that are expressed in brain regions associated with behavioral despair. Conclusions We report the results of phenotyping a large panel of inbred mouse strains for depression and anxiety-associated behaviors. These results show significant, heritable strain-specific differences in behavior, and should prove to be a valuable resource for the behavioral and genetics communities. Additionally, we used haplotype mapping to identify several loci that may contain genes that regulate behavioral despair."
https://openalex.org/W2140330188,"Determining the degree to which climate niches are conserved across plant species' native and introduced ranges is valuable to developing successful strategies to limit the introduction and spread of invasive plants, and also has important ecological and evolutionary implications. Here, we test whether climate niches differ between native and introduced populations of Impatiens walleriana, globally one of the most popular horticultural species. We use approaches based on both raw climate data associated with occurrence points and ecological niche models (ENMs) developed with Maxent. We include comparisons of climate niche breadth in both geographic and environmental spaces, taking into account differences in available habitats between the distributional areas. We find significant differences in climate envelopes between native and introduced populations when comparing raw climate variables, with introduced populations appearing to expand into wetter and cooler climates. However, analyses controlling for differences in available habitat in each region do not indicate expansion of climate niches. We therefore cannot reject the hypothesis that observed differences in climate envelopes reflect only the limited environments available within the species' native range in East Africa. Our results suggest that models built from only native range occurrence data will not provide an accurate prediction of the potential for invasiveness if applied to areas containing a greater range of environmental combinations, and that tests of niche expansion may overestimate shifts in climate niches if they do not control carefully for environmental differences between distributional areas."
https://openalex.org/W2093285833,"In aerobic respiration, the tricarboxylic acid cycle is pivotal to the complete oxidation of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids to carbon dioxide and water. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, lacks a conventional tricarboxylic acid cycle and depends exclusively on glycolysis for ATP production. However, all of the constituent enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle are annotated in the genome of P. falciparum, which implies that the pathway might have important, yet unidentified biosynthetic functions. Here we show that fumarate, a side product of the purine salvage pathway and a metabolic intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, is not a metabolic waste but is converted to aspartate through malate and oxaloacetate. P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes and free parasites incorporated [2,3-14C]fumarate into the nucleic acid and protein fractions. 13C NMR of parasites incubated with [2,3-13C]fumarate showed the formation of malate, pyruvate, lactate, and aspartate but not citrate or succinate. Further, treatment of free parasites with atovaquone inhibited the conversion of fumarate to aspartate, thereby indicating this pathway as an electron transport chain-dependent process. This study, therefore, provides a biosynthetic function for fumarate hydratase, malate quinone oxidoreductase, and aspartate aminotransferase of P. falciparum. In aerobic respiration, the tricarboxylic acid cycle is pivotal to the complete oxidation of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids to carbon dioxide and water. Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria, lacks a conventional tricarboxylic acid cycle and depends exclusively on glycolysis for ATP production. However, all of the constituent enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle are annotated in the genome of P. falciparum, which implies that the pathway might have important, yet unidentified biosynthetic functions.

This study, therefore, provides a biosynthetic function for fumarate hydratase, malate quinone oxidoreductase, and aspartate aminotransferase of P. falciparum. Plasmodium falciparum is a parasitic protozoan, which causes the most severe form of malaria in humans. Because of the emergence in the parasite of widespread drug resistance to most of the first-line antimalarials, the development of new drugs that target the parasite metabolism is needed. Over several years, malarial parasites have been studied to understand various novel biochemical features, which not only gives opportunities for chemotherapeutic interventions but also stimulates broader scientific interests. During the intraerythrocytic stages of P. falciparum, the tricarboxylic acid cycle does not seem to function like a conventional tricarboxylic acid cycle for the following reasons. (a) The bulk of the glucose is metabolized to lactate by anaerobic glycolysis, which is then secreted by the parasite as a metabolic waste (1Bryant C. Voller A. Smith M.J. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1964; 13: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (2Kirk K. Horner H.A. Kirk J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 82: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As a result, unlike aerobic cells, in P. falciparum there is minimal carbon flow from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid cycle. (b) The multi-enzyme complex pyruvate dehydrogenase, which channels pyruvate into the tricarboxylic acid cycle through acetyl-CoA, has been found to localize on the apicoplast membrane in P. falciparum (3Foth B.J. Stimmler L.M. Handman E. Crabb B.S. Hodder A.N. McFadden G.I. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 39-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), unlike mammalian cells, where the enzyme is present on the inner mitochondrial membrane (4Chen J. Jones M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 176: 82-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). (c) The enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase generates NADPH rather than NADH (5Wrenger C. Muller S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1775-1783Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), thereby implying that its main role is probably to act as a redox sensor rather than donating reducing equivalents to the electron transport chain. In addition, P. falciparum synthesizes ATP mainly by substrate level phosphorylation through glycolysis and not through oxidative phosphorylation (6Vaidya A.B. Mather M.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 63: 249-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), suggesting that the primary function of the tricarboxylic acid cycle in generating reducing equivalents for the electron transport chain might be dispensable for the parasite. However, genes for all of the enzymes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle are present and are expressed in P. falciparum (7Gardner M.J. Hall N. Fung E. White O. Berriman M. Hyman R.W. Carlton J.M. Pain A. Nelson K.E. Bowman S. Paulsen I.T. James K. Eisen J.A. Rutherford K. Salzberg S.L. Craig A. Kyes S. Chan M.S. Nene V. Shallom S.J. Suh B. Peterson J. Angiuoli S. Pertea M. Allen J.

PLoS Biol. 2003; 1: E5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar) during the intraerythrocytic stages, thereby implying that the pathway probably has important, yet unidentified biosynthetic functions. Unlike its human host, P. falciparum lacks the de novo purine biosynthetic pathway and is hence completely dependent on the purine salvage pathway to meet its purine nucleotide requirements (9Downie M.J. Kirk K. Mamoun C.B. Eukaryot. Cell. 2008; 7: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the purine salvage pathway, hypoxanthine salvaged from the host is phosphoribosylated to IMP, which then branches out to form AMP and GMP (Fig. 1). IMP is converted to AMP in two steps, catalyzed by two distinct enzymes: (a) adenylosuccinate synthetase, which adds a molecule of aspartate to the 6-oxo position of IMP with a concomitant hydrolysis of GTP to GDP to produce succinyl-AMP (10Raman J. Mehrotra S. Anand R.P. Balaram H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 138: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar); and (b) cleavage of succinyl-AMP to AMP and fumarate by adenylosuccinate lyase (11Bulusu V. Srinivasan B. Bopanna M.P. Balaram H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1794: 642-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Excess AMP is deaminated back to IMP by AMP deaminase. This cyclic conversion of IMP to AMP constitutes the purine nucleotide cycle (Fig. 1), which has been shown to play an important role under conditions (such as in muscle tissue) requiring excess ATP (12Aragon J.J. Lowenstein J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 110: 371-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The P. falciparum genome contains a homolog of AMP deaminase, suggesting the presence of the purine nucleotide cycle in the parasite. Apart from AMP, the other end product of this pathway is fumarate, which in most aerobic cells feeds into the tricarboxylic acid cycle (13Aragón J.J. Tornheim K. Goodman M.N. Lowenstein J.M. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 1981; 18: 131-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, in view of a dysfunctional tricarboxylic acid cycle in P. falciparum, the metabolic fate of fumarate is not known. Our studies with metabolic tracers implicate fumarate generated from the purine salvage pathway as being incorporated into nucleic acids and proteins and not secreted out by the parasite. Fumarate gets converted to malate and then subsequently to aspartate through a metabolic pathway that involves fumarate hydratase, malate quinone oxidoreductase, and aspartate aminotransferase. This report shows functionality to a portion of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and also highlights possible metabolic cross-talk between purine salvage and the electron transport chain in P. falciparum. All reagents and chemicals, unless mentioned otherwise, were obtained from Sigma. [U-14C]Aspartate (200 mCi mmol−1) was obtained from the Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology (BRIT), India. [2,3-14C]Fumarate (10 mCi mmol−1) and 2,3-[13C]fumarate were obtained from Sigma. [8-3H]Hypoxanthine (19.2 Ci mmol−1) was obtained from GE Healthcare. Primers for gene cloning were custom synthesized at Sigma. Human O+ serum and erythrocytes for maintenance of the 3D7 strain of P. falciparum were obtained from healthy volunteers from a local hospital. The 3D7 strain of P. falciparum was cultured in vitro as described previously (14Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar). Briefly, the parasites were maintained in human O+ erythrocytes isolated from O+ human blood collected from healthy volunteers at 5% hematocrit in RPMI 1640 (Sigma) buffered with HEPES containing 10% human serum and supplemented with 5% NaHCO3. The culture was grown at 37 °C in a candle jar. The medium was changed every 24 h, and parasitemia was estimated every 48 h by microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained smears. Free parasites were isolated by treating parasitized erythrocytes with 0.15% saponin. The parasitized culture was enriched for mature stages (trophozoites and schizonts) by centrifugation in a 70% Percoll (GE Healthcare) solution (15Rivadeneira E.M. Wasserman M. Espinal C.T. J. Protozool. 1983; 30: 367-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). 1 μCi of [U-14C]aspartate (25 μm) or [2,3-14C]fumarate (500 μm) was added to erythrocytes, parasitized erythrocytes (2% hematocrit and 6–8% parasitemia, 200 μl), or saponin-released free parasites (total protein: 2–3 mg ml−1). Although erythrocytes and parasitized erythrocytes were incubated for 24 or 48 h, saponin-released free parasites were incubated for 8 h at 37 °C in a 96-well flat-bottom plate placed in a candle jar. Parasites were in the trophozoite stage before labeling. After incubation, the spent medium of each cell type was collected and treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid for 15 min on ice followed by boiling for 10 min. The protein precipitate was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, lyophilized, and reconstituted in 10–20 μl of distilled water. 2–3 μl of the concentrated medium was spotted on a 10 × 5 cm TLC silica gel 60 F254 plate (Merck) and air-dried. A mobile phase consisting of n-butanol, acetic acid, and water at a ratio of 4:1:1 was used to run the TLC, following which the TLC plate was dried and developed using a Fuji FLA-5000 phosphorimaging device. For nucleic acid incorporation, the contents of each well were harvested onto glass fiber filters using a Combi-12 automated cell harvester (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), washed extensively with distilled water, and dried. The incorporated radioactivity was measured as disintegrations per minute using a Wallac 1409 liquid scintillation counter (Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland). To check the incorporation of radioactivity in proteins, the parasite culture was treated with 0.15% saponin solution for 2–3 min, which released the parasites from the erythrocytes. The parasite pellet was washed five or six times in PBS, resuspended in 1× SDS-gel loading buffer, boiled for 10 min, and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and developed on a Fuji FLA-5000 phosphorimaging device. For 14C label distribution between spent medium and parasite lysate, saponin-released erythrocyte-free parasites were incubated with 1 μCi (0.5 mm) of [2,3-14C]fumarate for 8 h and processed as described under the supplemental “Methods.” Free parasites, after incubation with the radioactive tracers [U-14C]aspartate, [2,3-14C]fumarate, and [8-3H]hypoxanthine, were washed thrice with 1× PBS to remove excess radioactive label, resuspended in distilled water, and lysed by rapid freeze-thawing. Soluble metabolites were extracted from the lysate by treatment with 0.5 m HClO4 for 30 min on ice using published protocols (16Cassera M.B. Hazleton K.Z. Riegelhaupt P.M. Merino E.F. Luo M. Akabas M.H. Schramm V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32889-32899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Samples were then neutralized with 5 m KOH and centrifuged to remove the precipitate. The supernatant was concentrated by lyophilization and stored at −80 °C till further use. Purine and pyrimidine nucleotide monophosphates were separated using a reversed phase ion-pair HPLC (Genesis® C18, 4 μm, 150 × 4.6 mm, Grace Davison Discovery Sciences). The mobile phases were 8 mm tetrabutylammonium bisulfate (Spectrochem)/100 mm KH2PO4 (pH 6.0) (solution A) and 30% acetonitrile containing 8 mm tetrabutylammonium bisulfate and 100 mm KH2PO4 (pH 6.0) (solution B). The cell extracts were resuspended in a small volume of solution A and spiked with nucleotide monophosphate standards. After injection, the column was run isocratically with solution A for 2 column volumes followed by a gradient from 0 to 100% solution B for 60 min. The eluate was monitored at 254 nm with the flow rate set at 0.7 ml min−1. Peaks corresponding to the nucleotide fraction were collected, and the radioactive counts were measured as counts per minute using a Wallac 1409 (Wallac Oy) liquid scintillation counter. Free parasites obtained from saponin treatment of parasitized erythrocytes were washed three times in 1× PBS and incubated with 10 mm [2,3-13C]fumarate for 4 h at 37 °C. Erythrocytes incubated with similar quantities of 13C-labeled tracers for the same amount of time served as controls. To monitor the effect of atovaquone, free parasites were treated with the drug (1 μm concentration) for 2 h followed by 4 h of incubation with [2,3-13C]fumarate. Following incubation, cell suspensions were frozen directly in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C till further use. Before NMR spectra were acquired, the cell suspensions were disrupted by sonication and centrifuged, and the supernatants were collected for analysis. After centrifugation for 30 min, the volume of the supernatant was made up to 450 μl with H2O, and 50 μl of D2O was added to obtain a final volume of 500 μl. 13C NMR spectra were collected on a 500-MHz Bruker NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm broadband probe. Measurements were recorded at 25 °C under a bilevel broadband-gated proton decoupling with D2O lock. Details of cloning, expression, and purification of PfMDH 4The abbreviations used are: Pf, Plasmodium falciparum; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; AAT, aspartate aminotransferase; FH, fumarate hydratase; CoQ, coenzyme Q; CoQH2, reduced coenzyme Q; Sc, Saccharomyces cerevisiae; DHODH, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase; MQO, malate quinone oxidoreductase; MDH, malate dehydrogenase; RBC, red blood cell; PRBC, parasitized red blood cell. and PfAAT are given under the supplemental “Methods.” PfAAT activity measurements were carried out as described by Winter and Dekker (17Winter H.C. Dekker E.E. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Total RNA from parasites was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Sigma), treated with DNase I (New England Biolabs), and extracted with phenol and chloroform. cDNA synthesis was carried out using MMLV reverse transcriptase (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacturer's instructions. DNase-treated total RNA was used as a control in PCR reactions to rule out DNA contamination. Specific primers were used in separate PCR reactions for checking the expression of the genes. Primer sequences for RT-PCR are provided under the supplemental “Methods.” The purified PfMDH (100 μg) was injected subcutaneously into a healthy New Zealand White rabbit after emulsification in complete Freund's adjuvant followed by two boosters in incomplete Freund's adjuvant, each separated by 14 days. Purified PfAAT (100 μg) was injected into mice (BALB/c), and subsequent injections were the same as in the case of PfMDH. Antiserum collected from the animals at the end of 14 days after the second booster was stored at 4 °C to allow complete coagulation of blood. The serum was separated by centrifugation. The supernatant was stored in aliquots in sterile tubes at −20 °C till further use. Free parasites were treated with increasing concentrations of digitonin as described previously (18Hodges M. Yikilmaz E. Patterson G. Kasvosve I. Rouault T.A. Gordeuk V.R. Loyevsky M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2005; 143: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Total protein lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE (12%) and blotted onto a PVDF membrane using a Hoefer wet transfer apparatus (Hoefer®). Immunodetections were performed using the primary antibodies, mouse anti-PfAAT (1:2000), rabbit anti-PfMDH (1:2000), and rabbit anti-PfHSP60 (1:1000). As secondary antibody, anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) was used. Western blots were developed using the Pierce SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent kit as described by the manufacturer. Indirect immunofluorescence was done as described previously (19Tonkin C.J. van Dooren G.G. Spurck T.P. Struck N.S. Good R.T. Handman E. Cowman A.F. McFadden G.I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 137: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) with minor modifications as described under the supplemental “Methods.” In the purine salvage pathway, the overall reaction of adenylosuccinate synthetase and adenylosuccinate lyase involves the transfer of an α-amino group from aspartate to the 6-oxo group of IMP to generate AMP, with the rest of the carbon skeleton of aspartate released as fumarate. To check whether P. falciparum secretes fumarate as a metabolic waste, PRBCs were incubated with 1 μCi of [U-14C]aspartate for 24 h, and spent medium was analyzed. RBCs were also incubated with the label as a control. [U-14C]Aspartate is expected to produce [U-14C]fumarate as a consequence of the purine salvage pathway (Fig. 2A), and if the latter is a metabolic waste, it should be secreted by PRBCs out into the medium. Upon examination by TLC of the spent medium of RBCs and PRBCs, no radioactive spot corresponding to the mobility of [14C]fumarate could be observed (Fig. 2B). To increase the sensitivity of the assay, the spent medium was concentrated before spotting, and the TLC plate was exposed for a longer time. Still, a spot corresponding to the mobility of fumarate could not be observed (data not shown). The failure to detect fumarate in the spent medium could also be because of limited uptake and metabolism of aspartate by PRBCs. However, PRBCs incubated with [U-14C]aspartate showed a significant amount of radioactivity in the nucleic acid and protein fractions (supplemental Fig. S1) indicating that [U-14C]aspartate was taken up and metabolized by the PRBCs. Saponin-released erythrocyte-free parasites also showed a dose-dependant incorporation of [U-14C]aspartate in to the nucleic acids (supplemental Fig. S1). Aspartate incorporation in the nucleic acids could be explained by the fact that P. falciparum synthesizes pyrimidines by the de novo pathway, in which the carbon skeleton of aspartate forms the backbone of the pyrimidine ring. These results imply that fumarate generated by the purine salvage pathway in P. falciparum is not secreted out in the medium and hence is not a metabolic waste. Therefore, to examine the metabolic fate of fumarate, RBCs and PRBCs were incubated with 1 μCi of [2,3-14C]fumarate for 24 and 48 h, and radioactivity was checked in nucleic acid fractions. The radiochemical purity of [2,3-14C]fumarate was established by TLC (Fig. 3A). PRBCs showed significant incorporation of radioactivity with counts in control erythrocytes being very low (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, radioactivity was also seen associated with the protein fraction of PRBCs, with all of the protein bands obtained from the cell lysate being radiolabeled (Fig. 3C). During the intraerythrocytic stages of P. falciparum life cycle, there exists an extensive metabolic cross-talk between the RBC and the parasite. Hence, metabolic labeling studies with [2,3-14C]fumarate were also done on saponin-released erythrocyte-free parasites. Here, the time of incubation of the parasites with [2,3-14C]fumarate was reduced to 8 h, and radioactivity in the nucleic acids was counted. A dose-dependent increase in radioactive incorporation in the nucleic acid fractions was obtained with [2,3-14C]fumarate, implicating the exclusive role of parasite metabolism through parasite-encoded enzymes (Fig. 3D). [2,3-14C]Fumarate incorporation in proteins indicates that fumarate is probably metabolized to an amino acid. Examination of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (20Kanehisa M. Goto S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (18879) Google Scholar) indicated that fumarate can be converted to three amino acids: aspartate, alanine, and glutamate. If fumarate is indeed converted to aspartate, then the nucleic acid incorporation could also be explained, as aspartate forms the backbone of pyrimidines. To explore this possibility, saponin-released free parasites were labeled with [2,3-14C]fumarate for 4 h. Following metabolite extraction, the samples were spiked with nucleotide monophosphate standards, which were then separated by ion-pair reversed phase HPLC (Fig. 4A). As a control, the nucleotide labeling pattern was assessed in parasites incubated with 1 μCi of [8-3H]hypoxanthine and [U-14C]aspartate. Free parasites incubated with [8-3H]hypoxanthine showed radioactive labeling of purines, GMP and AMP (Fig. 4B), whereas parasites treated with [U-14C]aspartate showed maximum radioactivity under UMP (Fig. 4C). Parasites incubated with [2,3-14C]fumarate showed maximum radioactive incorporation in UMP followed by CMP, with counts in GMP and AMP fractions being insignificant (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that fumarate incorporation into nucleic acids is not through the ribose moiety (as in that case, both purines and pyrimidines should be labeled) but specifically through the pyrimidine backbone. We therefore predict that fumarate is converted to aspartate and then incorporated into proteins and nucleic acids of P. falciparum. Examination of the KEGG metabolic pathway database (20Kanehisa M. Goto S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (18879) Google Scholar) highlights two possible routes for the formation of aspartate from fumarate. The first includes the metabolic intermediates malate and oxaloacetate, whereas the second is a direct conversion of fumarate to aspartate catalyzed by the enzyme aspartase (Fig. 5A). To distinguish between these two pathways, 0.5 mm fumarate, malate, and aspartate were added separately along with [2,3-14C]fumarate. If malate is not an intermediate in the metabolism of fumarate, and only a direct conversion operates in P. falciparum, then the presence of malate should not dilute the radioactive counts arising from [2,3-14C]fumarate incorporation. However, the radioactive counts in cultures incubated with both 1 μCi of [2,3-14C]fumarate and cold 0.5 mm fumarate, malate, or aspartate dropped to nearly 30–40% of the counts obtained from cultures in which only [2,3-14C]fumarate was added (supplemental Fig. S2). The drop in radioactive counts could be because of the existence of a common pathway that metabolizes both the radioactive tracer ([2,3-14C]fumarate) and its corresponding unlabeled metabolite as well as further downstream metabolic intermediates, or alternately, the drop in counts could be because of toxicity of these metabolic intermediates to the growth of P. falciparum. To check this, [8-3H]hypoxanthine labeling of nucleic acids was done in the presence or absence of these intermediates (supplemental Fig. S2). No difference in the percent incorporation was observed across untreated and treated parasite cultures, ruling out the toxicity of these intermediates to P. falciparum growth and thus supporting the existence of a common pathway for the metabolism of fumarate, malate, and oxaloacetate. To further confirm the nature of the intermediary metabolites, free parasites were incubated with 10 mm [2,3-13C]fumarate for 4 h in 1× PBS and then processed for 13C NMR analysis. 13C proton-decoupled NMR of the parasites showed 13C enrichment in fumarate (chemical shift of C-2 and C-3 carbons in fumarate is at 136 ppm). The other dominant peaks were found at 70 and 42 ppm, which correspond, respectively, to the C-2 and C-3 of malate. In addition to these findings, 13C enrichment was also found in aspartate (C-2 δ, 52 ppm; C-3 δ, 36 ppm) and pyruvate (C-2 δ, 205 ppm; C-3 δ, 26 ppm) (Fig. 5C). Integration of the peak areas of fumarate, malate, aspartate pyruvate, and lactate in the 13C NMR spectrum shows the following relative enrichments: fumarate, 55.9 ± 16%; malate, 39.5 ± 17%; aspartate, 2.89 ± 0.62%; pyruvate, 2 ± 1.2%; and lactate, 1.2 ± 0.5%. On the other hand, RBCs incubated with [2,3-13C]fumarate showed enrichment in fumarate, malate, and lactate (Fig. 5B). Free parasite culture incubated with [14C]fumarate was used to compare the radioactive counts metabolized and retained within the parasite with that secreted. The spent medium had 48 ± 7% of the input counts, whereas 28 ± 5% of the counts were associated with the cellular fraction. Upon separation of the spent medium on TLC, all the counts were found to be mainly in the lower spot corresponding to malate. It should be noted here that the spot corresponding to the mobility of malate might well include other polar metabolites such as aspartate, pyruvate, and lactate. Taken together with the NMR data, it would appear that this spot should largely contain malate. Enzymes catalyzing the conversion of fumarate to aspartate are fumarate hydratase (FH), MDH, or malate quinone oxidoreductase (MQO) and aspartate aminotransferase (AAT). The P. falciparum genome contains homologs of all of these enzymes. Previously, it was shown that malate dehydrogenase is cytosolic (21Lang-Unnasch N. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 17-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 22Pradhan A. Mukherjee P. Tripathi A.K. Avery M.A. Walker L.A. Tekwani B.L. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2009; 325: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), but the subcellular localization of other enzymes is unknown. RT-PCR analysis showed the expression of FH, MQO, and AAT (Fig. 6A). Fumarate hydratase is an enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of fumarate to malate. Free parasites were treated with increasing concentrations of digitonin to prepare distinct cytosolic and organellar protein fractions. Digitonin is a non-ionic detergent used to solubilize cellular and organellar membranes. At lower concentrations of digitonin, cell membrane is permeabilized and cytosolic proteins are released, whereas at subsequent higher concentrations, the organellar and nuclear membranes are solubilized and organellar extracts are obtained. As PfMDH is cytosolic, it was used as a cytosolic marker in the experiments reported here. The digitonin concentration required to fully release cytoplasmic proteins from free parasites was obtained by using antisera against the cytoplasmic marker protein, malate dehydrogenase. On the other hand, antisera against P. falciparum heat shock protein 60 (PfHSP60) (a kind gift from Prof. G. Padmanabhan, Indian Institute of Science) were used as mitochondrial marker. From the Western blot analysis, these values were obtained as 0.17 and 3.5 mm, respectively (Fig. 6, B and C). The digitonin extracts were probed for P. falciparum fumarate hydratase through its enzymatic activity for the formation of [14C]malate from [14C]fumarate. Porcine heart fumarase (Sigma) was used as a positive control. P. falciparum fumarate hydratase (PfFH) activity was found more in the cell extracts obtained by permeabilization with higher digitonin concentrations of 3.5 and 7.0 mm (Fig. 6D). This indicates that PfFH is not cytosolic but probably mitochondrial. In support of this, PfFH shows a very high probability (0.89) of being targeted to mitochondria as predicted by the MitoProt II 1.0a4 program (23Claros M.G. Vincens P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). Antisera raised against recombinant P. falciparum aspartate aminotransferase (PfAAT) specifically recognized a protein of 50 kDa, the expected molecular mass of the enzyme. Earlier studies on the cloning, expression, and substrate specificity of recombinant PfAAT revealed that the enzyme catalyzes the transamination of α-ketomethylthiobutyrate to generate methionine (24Berger L.C. Wilson J. Wood P. Berger B.J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4421-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These authors speculated that this enzyme has an important role in methionine recycling (24Berger L.C. Wilson J. Wood P. Berger B.J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 4421-4434Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar); however, the subcellular localization of this enzyme was not known. Our Western blotting analysis on digitonin extracts showed that PfAAT was present in the cytosol"

The 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) plays an integral part in this mitochondrial cholesterol transport. Consistent with its role in intracellular cholesterol movement, TSPO possesses a cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC) motif that has been demonstrated to bind cholesterol. To further investigate the TSPO CRAC motif, we performed molecular modeling studies and identified a novel ligand, 3,17,19-androsten-5-triol (19-Atriol) that inhibits cholesterol binding at the CRAC motif. 19-Atriol could bind a synthetic CRAC peptide and rapidly inhibited hormonally induced steroidogenesis in MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells and constitutive steroidogenesis in R2C rat Leydig tumor cells at low micromolar concentrations. Inhibition at these concentrations was not due to toxicity or inhibition of the CYP11A1 enzyme and was reversed upon removal of the compound. In addition, 19-Atriol was an even more potent inhibitor of PK 11195-stimulated steroidogenesis, with activity in the high nanomolar range. This was accomplished without affecting PK 11195 binding or basal steroidogenesis. Finally, 19-Atriol inhibited mitochondrial import and processing of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein without any effect on TSPO protein levels. In conclusion, we have identified a novel androstenetriol that can interact with the CRAC domain of TSPO, can control hormonal and constitutive steroidogenesis, and may prove to be a useful tool in the therapeutic control of diseases of excessive steroid formation.

https://openalex.org/W2054040386,"Presenilin 1 (PS1) and Presenilin 2 (PS2) are the enzymatic component of the γ-secretase complex that cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP) to release amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide. PS deficiency in mice results in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the absence of accumulated Aβ. We hypothesize that PS influences neuroinflammation through its γ-secretase action in CNS innate immune cells. We exposed primary murine microglia to a pharmacological γ-secretase inhibitor which resulted in exaggerated release of TNFα and IL-6 in response to lipopolysaccharide. To determine if this response was mediated by PS1, PS2 or both we used shRNA to knockdown each PS in a murine microglia cell line. Knockdown of PS1 did not lead to decreased γ-secretase activity while PS2 knockdown caused markedly decreased γ-secretase activity. Augmented proinflammatory cytokine release was observed after knockdown of PS2 but not PS1. Proinflammatory stimuli increased microglial PS2 gene transcription and protein in vitro. This is the first demonstration that PS2 regulates CNS innate immunity. Taken together, our findings suggest that PS2 is the predominant γ-secretase in microglia and modulates release of proinflammatory cytokines. We propose PS2 may participate in a negative feedback loop regulating inflammatory behavior in microglia."
https://openalex.org/W1988166395,"The brain and other organs locally synthesize steroids. Local synthesis is suggested when steroid levels are higher in tissue than in the circulation. However, measurement of both circulating and tissue steroid levels are subject to methodological considerations. For example, plasma samples are commonly used to estimate circulating steroid levels in whole blood, but steroid levels in plasma and whole blood could differ. In addition, tissue steroid measurements might be affected by blood contamination, which can be addressed experimentally by using saline perfusion to remove blood. In Study 1, we measured corticosterone and testosterone (T) levels in zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) plasma, whole blood, and red blood cells (RBC). We also compared corticosterone in plasma, whole blood, and RBC at baseline and after 60 min restraint stress. In Study 2, we quantified corticosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), T, and 17β-estradiol (E₂) levels in the brains of sham-perfused or saline-perfused subjects. In Study 1, corticosterone and T concentrations were highest in plasma, significantly lower in whole blood, and lowest in RBC. In Study 2, saline perfusion unexpectedly increased corticosterone levels in the rostral telencephalon but not other regions. In contrast, saline perfusion decreased DHEA levels in caudal telencephalon and diencephalon. Saline perfusion also increased E₂ levels in caudal telencephalon. In summary, when comparing local and systemic steroid levels, the inclusion of whole blood samples should prove useful. Moreover, blood contamination has little or no effect on measurement of brain steroid levels, suggesting that saline perfusion is not necessary prior to brain collection. Indeed, saline perfusion itself may elevate and lower steroid concentrations in a rapid, region-specific manner."

In Drosophila, Gαi is required for Hedgehog (Hh) activity, but the involvement of heterotrimeric G proteins in vertebrate Shh signaling has not yet been established. Here, we show that Shh-induced proliferation of rat CGNPs is enhanced strongly by the expression of the active forms of Gαi/o proteins (Gαi1, Gαi2, Gαi3, and Gαo) but not by members of another class (Gα12) of heterotrimeric G proteins. Additionally, the mRNAs of these different Gαi members display specific expression patterns in the developing cerebellum; only Gαi2 and Gαi3 are substantially expressed in the outer external granular layer, where CGNPs proliferate. Consistent with this, Shh-induced proliferation of CGNPs is reduced significantly by knockdowns of Gαi2 and Gαi3 but not by silencing of other members of the Gαi/o class. Finally, our results demonstrate that Gαi2 and Gαi3 locate to the primary cilium when expressed in CGNP cultures.

Surprisingly, we observed no dengue hemorrhagic fever cases among 353 hospitalized dengue-infected patients including 212 with primary, and 141 with secondary dengue 1 infection in China. To explore virological and immunological mechanisms which may account for this unexpected clinical observation, we assessed dengue viremia, type I interferon and inflammatory cytokine levels in these patients. While the levels of viremia and inflammatory cytokines are indistinguishable between primary and secondary infections, IFNα levels are significantly higher in primary than that in secondary infection. However, IFNα levels are positively correlated with dengue viremia levels (p<0.0001), but negatively correlated with the platelet counts (p<0.0001) and serum ALT levels (p = 0.0003). These results provide direct in vivo evidence that clinical dengue disease severity is affected by both viral and human immune factors."
https://openalex.org/W2106293467,"Amyloid formation is initiated by protein misfolding, followed by self-association to ultimately form amyloid fibrils. The discovery of toxic prefibrillar oligomers in many amyloidosis underscores the importance of understanding the folding mechanism prior to such aggregation. Here, we investigated the folding properties of the natively unfolded amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide and the familial variants (A21G, E22Q, E22G, E22K, and D23N) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In combinations of native electrophoresis, analytical ultracentrifugation, fluorescence emission, and far-UV circular dichroism, we showed that all Aβ40 variants are predominantly monomeric with similar residual secondary structures, but distinct hydrophobic-exposed protein surfaces. Guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) denaturation in the absence and presence of trifluoroethanol (TFE) showed that Aβ variants adopt an apparent 2-state equilibrium model with different stabilities, in which wild type is less stable than A21G but more stable than D23N and E22 mutants. By correlating the folding stability with the nucleation phase in fibrillization, we found the more stable the variant, the slower the nucleation, except for D23N. Besides, the unfolding of Aβ conformation leads to reduced formation of mature fibrils, but an increase in nonfibrillar, amorphous type of aggregates. Overall, we demonstrated that folding stability of Aβ is an important determinant of the nucleation kinetics.—Ni, C.-L., Shi, H.-P., Yu, H.-M., Chang, Y.-C., and Chen, Y.-R.

https://openalex.org/W2141792783,"The mannosyltransferase Och1 is the key enzyme for synthesis of elaborated protein N-glycans in yeast. In filamentous fungi genes implicated in outer chain formation are present, but their function is unclear. In this study we have analyzed the Och1 protein of Aspergillus fumigatus. We provide first evidence that poly-mannosylated N-glycans exist in A. fumigatus and that their synthesis requires AfOch1 activity. This implies that AfOch1 plays a similar role as S. cerevisiae ScOch1 in the initiation of an N-glycan outer chain. A Δafoch1 mutant showed normal growth under standard and various stress conditions including elevated temperature, cell wall and oxidative stress. However, sporulation of this mutant was dramatically reduced in the presence of high calcium concentrations, suggesting that certain proteins engaged in sporulation require N-glycan outer chains to be fully functional. A characteristic feature of AfOch1 and Och1 homologues from other filamentous fungi is a signal peptide that clearly distinguishes them from their yeast counterparts. However, this difference does not appear to have consequences for its localization in the Golgi. Replacing the signal peptide of AfOch1 by a membrane anchor had no impact on its ability to complement the sporulation defect of the Δafoch1 strain. The mutant triggered a normal cytokine response in infected murine macrophages, arguing against a role of outer chains as relevant Aspergillus pathogen associated molecular patterns. Infection experiments provided no evidence for attenuation in virulence; in fact, according to our data the Δafoch1 mutant may even be slightly more virulent than the control strains."
https://openalex.org/W2016143687,"Background Seamounts have been identified as aggregating locations for pelagic biodiversity including tuna; however the topography and prevailing oceanography differ between seamounts and not all are important for tuna. Although a relatively common feature in oceanic ecosystems, little information is available that identifies those that are biologically important. Improved knowledge offers opportunities for unique management of these areas, which may advance the sustainable management of oceanic resources. In this study, we evaluate the existence of an association between seamounts and tuna longline fisheries at the ocean basin scale, identify significant seamounts for tuna in the western and central Pacific Ocean, and quantify the seamount contribution to the tuna longline catch. Methodology/Principal Findings We use data collected for the Western and Central Pacific Ocean for bigeye, yellowfin, and albacore tuna at the ocean basin scale. GLMs were applied to a coupled dataset of longline fisheries catch and effort, and seamount location information. The analyses show that seamounts may be associated with an annual longline combined catch of 35 thousand tonnes, with higher catch apparent for yellowfin, bigeye, and albacore tuna on 17%, 14%, and 14% of seamounts respectively. In contrast 14%, 18%, and 20% of seamounts had significantly lower catches for yellowfin, bigeye and albacore tuna respectively. Studying catch data in relation to seamount positions presents several challenges such as bias in location of seamounts, or lack of spatial resolution of fisheries data. Whilst we recognize these limitations the criteria used for detecting significant seamounts were conservative and the error in identification is likely to be low albeit unknown. Conclusions/Significance Seamounts throughout the study area were found to either enhance or reduce tuna catch. This indicates that management of seamounts is important Pacific-wide, but management approaches must take account of local conditions. Management of tuna and biodiversity resources in the region would benefit from considering such effects."

Although Vav family guanine nucleotide exchange factors impact processes highly relevant to atherogenesis and are involved in pathways common to scavenger receptor CD36 signaling, their role in CD36-dependent macrophage foam cell formation remains unknown. The goal of the present study was to determine the contribution of Vav proteins to CD36-dependent foam cell formation and to identify the mechanisms by which Vavs participate in the process. We found that CD36 contributes to activation of Vav-1, -2, and -3 in aortae from hyperlipidemic mice and that oxidatively modified LDL (oxLDL) induces activation of macrophage Vav in vitro in a CD36 and Src family kinase-dependent manner. CD36-dependent uptake of oxLDL in vitro and foam cell formation in vitro and in vivo was significantly reduced in Vav null macrophages. These studies for the first time link CD36 and Vavs in a signaling pathway required for macrophage foam cell formation."
https://openalex.org/W2126927132,"Aeromonas hydrophila is the most common Aeromonas species causing infections in human and other animals such as amphibians, reptiles, fish and crustaceans. Pathogenesis of Aeromonas species have been reported to be associated with virulence factors such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), bacterial toxins, bacterial secretion systems, flagella, and other surface molecules. Several mutant strains of A. hydrophila AH-3 were initially used to study their virulence in two animal species, Pacifastacus leniusculus (crayfish) and Tenebrio molitor larvae (mealworm). The AH-3 strains used in this study have mutations in genes involving the synthesis of flagella, LPS structures, secretion systems, and some other factors, which have been reported to be involved in A. hydrophila pathogenicity. Our study shows that the LPS (O-antigen and external core) is the most determinant A. hydrophila AH-3 virulence factor in both animals. Furthermore, we studied the immune responses of these hosts to infection of virulent or non-virulent strains of A. hydrophila AH-3. The AH-3 wild type (WT) containing the complete LPS core is highly virulent and this bacterium strongly stimulated the prophenoloxidase activating system resulting in melanization in both crayfish and mealworm. In contrast, the ΔwaaE mutant which has LPS without O-antigen and external core was non-virulent and lost ability to stimulate this system and melanization in these two animals. The high phenoloxidase activity found in WT infected crayfish appears to result from a low expression of pacifastin, a prophenoloxidase activating enzyme inhibitor, and this gene expression was not changed in the ΔwaaE mutant infected animal and consequently phenoloxidase activity was not altered as compared to non-infected animals. Therefore we show that the virulence factors of A. hydrophila are the same regardless whether an insect or a crustacean is infected and the O-antigen and external core is essential for activation of the proPO system and as virulence factors for this bacterium."

Leptospiral immunoglobulin-like (Lig) proteins, LigA and LigB, are surface exposed proteins containing Bacterial immunoglobulin like (Big) domains. The function of proteins which contain Big fold is not known. Based on the possible similarities of immunoglobulin and βγ-crystallin folds, we here explore the important question whether Ca²+ binds to a Big domains, which would provide a novel functional role of the proteins containing Big fold.We selected six individual Big domains for this study (three from the conserved part of LigA and LigB, denoted as Lig A3, Lig A4, and LigBCon5; two from the variable region of LigA, i.e., 9(th) (Lig A9) and 10(th) repeats (Lig A10); and one from the variable region of LigB, i.e., LigBCen2. We have also studied the conserved region covering the three and six repeats (LigBCon1-3 and LigCon). All these proteins bind the calcium-mimic dye Stains-all. All the selected four domains bind Ca²+ with dissociation constants of 2-4 µM. Lig A9 and Lig A10 domains fold well with moderate thermal stability, have β-sheet conformation and form homodimers. Fluorescence spectra of Big domains show a specific doublet (at 317 and 330 nm), probably due to Trp interaction with a Phe residue. Equilibrium unfolding of selected Big domains is similar and follows a two-state model, suggesting the similarity in their fold.We demonstrate that the Lig are Ca²+-binding proteins, with Big domains harbouring the binding motif. We conclude that despite differences in sequence, a Big motif binds Ca²+. This work thus sets up a strong possibility for classifying the proteins containing Big domains as a novel family of Ca²+-binding proteins. Since Big domain is a part of many proteins in bacterial kingdom, we suggest a possible function these proteins via Ca²+ binding."

Using the Y14/Magoh heterodimer as bait in a screening for its interacting partners, we identified the protein-arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 as a candidate. We show that Y14 and Magoh, but not other factors of the exon junction complex, interact with the cytoplasmic PRMT5-containing methylosome. We further provide evidence that Y14 promoted the activity of PRMT5 in methylation of Sm proteins of the small nuclear ribonucleoprotein core, whereas knockdown of Y14 reduced their methylation level. Moreover, Y14 overexpression induced the formation of a large, active, and small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP)-associated methylosome complex. However, Y14 may only transiently associate with the snRNP assembly complex in the cytoplasm. Together, our results suggest that Y14 facilitates Sm protein methylation probably by its activity in promoting the formation or stability of the methylosome-containing complex. We hypothesize that Y14 provides a regulatory link between pre-mRNA splicing and snRNP biogenesis."

Mutations that inactivate G5 or G8 cause hypercholesterolemia and premature atherosclerosis. We showed previously that the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) in the heterodimer are not functionally equivalent; sterol transport is abolished by mutations in the consensus residues of NBD2 but not of NBD1. Here, we examined the structural requirements of NBD1 for sterol transport. Substitutions of the D-loop aspartate and Q-loop glutamine in either NBD did not impair sterol transport. The H-loop histidine of NBD2 (but not NBD1) was required for sterol transport. Exchange of the signature motifs between the NBDs did not interfere with sterol transport, whereas swapping the Walker A, Walker B, and signature motifs together resulted in failure to transport sterols. Selected substitutions within NBD1 altered substrate specificity: transport of plant sterols by the heterodimer was preserved, whereas transport of cholesterol was abolished. In summary, these data indicate that NBD1, although not required for ATP hydrolysis, is essential for normal function of G5G8 in sterol transport. Both the position and structural integrity of NBD2 are essential for sterol transport activity."

In turn, exposure to MOR agonists leads to changes in RGS4 at the mRNA and/or protein level. Here we have used human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells that endogenously express MOR, DOR, and RGS4 to study opioid-mediated down-regulation of RGS4. Overnight treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with the MOR agonist DAMGO or the DOR agonist DPDPE decreased RGS4 protein by ∼60% accompanied by a profound loss of opioid receptors but with no change in RGS4 mRNA. The decrease in RGS4 protein was prevented by the pretreatment with pertussis toxin or the opioid antagonist naloxone. The agonist-induced down-regulation of RGS4 proteins was completely blocked by treatment with the proteasome inhibitors MG132 or lactacystin or high concentrations of leupeptin, indicating involvement of ubiquitin-proteasome and lysosomal degradation. Polyubiquitinated RGS4 protein was observed in the presence of MG132 or the specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin and promoted by opioid agonist. The loss of opioid receptors was not prevented by MG132, demonstrating a different degradation pathway. RGS4 is a GTPase accelerating protein for both Gα(i/o) and Gα(q) proteins. After overnight treatment with DAMGO to reduce RGS4 protein, signaling at the Gα(i/o)-coupled DOR and the Gα(q)-coupled M(3) muscarinic receptor (M(3)R) was increased but not signaling of the α(2) adrenergic receptor or bradykinin BK(2) receptor, suggesting the development of cross-talk between the DOR and M(3)R involving RGS4."

Here we show that short, linear protein motifs can be efficiently recovered from proteome-scale datasets such as sub-cellular localization, molecular function, half-life, and protein abundance data using an information theoretic approach. Using this approach, we have identified many known protein motifs, such as phosphorylation sites and localization signals, and discovered a large number of candidate elements. We estimate that ~80% of these are novel predictions in that they do not match a known motif in both sequence and biological context, suggesting that post-translational regulation of protein behavior is still largely unexplored. These predicted motifs, many of which display preferential association with specific biological pathways and non-random positioning in the linear protein sequence, provide focused hypotheses for experimental validation."

LacZ staining of E11 embryos obtained by first using the vectors in pools and then testing individual candidates led to the identification of 3 enhancers, only one of which shows significant evolutionary conservation. In situ hybridization and 3C/4C experiments suggest that this enhancer, which is active in the neural tube and posterior diencephalon, influences the expression of the Olig1 and/or Olig2 genes. This work provides a new approach for the large-scale in vivo screening of transcriptional regulatory sequences, and further demonstrates that evolutionary conservation alone seems too limiting a criterion for the identification of enhancers."

Both HDL and apoA-I were found to exert multiple antiatherogenic properties, for example on the function and viability of the endothelium, the cholesterol homoeostasis and inflammatory state of macrophages, lipoprotein oxidation, coagulation, and thrombosis (2von Eckardstein A. Expert Rev. Cardiovasc. Ther. 2010; 8: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 11Natarajan P. Ray K.K. Cannon C.P. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2010; 55: 1283-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). One major antiatherogenic effect is the removal of excess cholesterol from macrophage foam cells of atherosclerotic lesions and its delivery to the liver for biliary excretion (12Curtiss L.K. Valenta D.T. Hime N.J. Rye K.A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2006; 26: 12-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To fulfill their atheroprotective actions in the subendothelial space of arteries, HDL or its precursor, lipid-poor apoA-I, have to leave the circulation and pass the endothelium. This cellular monolayer of the interior surface of blood vessels forms a semipermeable barrier and regulates liquid and solute transport between intra- and extravascular compartments (13Minshall R.D. Malik A.B. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2006; 176: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Little is known on how plasma proteins including HDL and apoA-I cross this endothelial barrier and enter the vascular wall (14von Eckardstein A. Rohrer L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2009; 20: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Morphological, biochemical, and physiological studies have suggested both paracellular and transcellular transport of proteins through the intact endothelium. We previously demonstrated that the transendothelial transport of both HDL and apoA-I involves saturable and specific processes. Transport of HDL is modulated by ABCG1 and the scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) (15Rohrer L. Ohnsorg P.M. Lehner M. Landolt F. Rinninger F. von Eckardstein A. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 1142-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) whereas the transendothelial transport of lipid-free apoA-I is modulated by ABCA1. After apical-to-basolateral transport though aortic endothelial cells (ECs) the initially lipid-free apoA-I was recovered as a lipidated particle (16Rohrer L. Cavelier C. Fuchs S. Schlüter M.A. Völker W. von Eckardstein A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Cavelier C. Rohrer L. von Eckardstein A. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 1060-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). From this observation and in analogy to similar observations on apoA-I- and ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux from macrophages (18Lorenzi I. von Eckardstein A. Radosavljevic S. Rohrer L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1781: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J.

Lipidol. 2006; 17: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that the transendothelial transport of apoA-I is a two-step process. First, a functional interaction between apoA-I and ABCA1 is required to generate a lipidated particle that is subsequently transported by ABCA1-independent processes. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the endothelial binding and transport properties of initially lipid-free as well as prelipidated apoA-I mutants that have been previously well characterized for their capacity to induce ABCA1-dependent phospholipid and cholesterol efflux from macrophage cell lines and to form HDL both in vitro and in vivo (21Zannis V. High Density Lipoproteins: From Basic Biology to Clinical Aspects. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim2007: 237-265Google Scholar). Specifically, we compared recombinant wild-type (WT) apoA-I, two mutants with either a deletion (apoA-I(Δ185–243)) or multiple amino acid substitutions in the carboxyl-terminal domain, which are both defective in eliciting ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux from macrophages as well as three apoA-I mutants with deletions of either the amino terminus (apoA-I(Δ1–59)) or midregional domains (apoA-I(Δ144–165)) or both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains (apoA-I(Δ1–59/Δ185–243)), which have no or only slightly impaired lipid efflux capacity (22Chroni A.

Our data show that the carboxyl-terminal ABCA1 interaction domain of apoA-I is mandatory for the transendothelial transport of lipid-free apoA-I but not of prelipidated apoA-I particles and thus support the model of a two-step process for transendothelial apoA-I transport. ECs were isolated from bovine aortas as described previously (23Gajdusek C.M. Schwartz S.M. In Vitro. 1983; 19: 394-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air incubator. ECs were transfected with 100 nm Stealth siRNA against ABCA1, ABCG1, ABCA1/ABCG1, or SR-BI and 34 nm BLOCK-iT fluorescent oligonucleotide (Invitrogen) as described previously (15Rohrer L. Ohnsorg P.M. Lehner M. Landolt F. Rinninger F. von Eckardstein A. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 1142-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Binding and transport assays were conducted between 65 and 72 h after transfection. The efficiency of the silencing was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting, as shown previously (15Rohrer L. Ohnsorg P.M. Lehner M. Landolt F. Rinninger F. von Eckardstein A. Circ.

Human HDL (1.063<d<1.21 kg/liter) was isolated from fresh normolipidemic plasmas of blood donors by sequential ultracentrifugation (24Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6497) Google Scholar). The purity of the lipoprotein preparation was verified by SDS-PAGE to ensure no contamination with LDL or albumin. Lipid-free human plasma WT apoA-I was further purified from delipidated HDL as described previously (25Brown W.V. Levy R.I. Fredrickson D.S. J. Biol.

Production of the recombinant WT apoA-I and of the apoA-I mutants Δ(185–243), Δ(144–165), Δ(1–59), and Δ(1–59)/Δ(185–243) was described previously (22Chroni A. Liu T. Gorshkova I. Kan H.Y. Uehara Y.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10529-10539Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The apoA-I gene lacking the BglII restriction site (that is present at nucleotide positions 181 of the genomic sequence relative to the ATG codon of the gene) was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector to generate the pcDNA3.1-apoA-I(ΔBglII) plasmid as described (30Koukos G. Chroni A. Duka A. Kardassis D. Zannis V.I. Biochem. J. 2007; 406: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This plasmid was used as a template to introduce the apoA-I(L218A/L219A/V221A/L222A) mutations in apoA-I using the mutagenesis kit QuikChange® XL (Stratagene) and the mutagenic primers. The forward and reverse primers used are: forward, 5′-GGACCTCCGCCAAGGCGCGGCGCCCGCGGCGGAGAGCTTCAAGGTC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GACCTTGAAGCTCTCCGCCGCGGGCGCCGCGCCTTGGCGGAGGTCC-3′ (sites of the mutagenesis are underlined). Following 18 cycles of PCR amplification of the template DNA, the PCR product was treated with DpnI to digest plasmids containing methylated DNA in one or both of their strands. The reaction product consisting of plasmids containing newly synthesized DNA carrying the mutations of interest were used to transform competent XL-10 blue bacteria cells (Stratagene). Ampicillin-resistant clones were selected, and plasmid DNA was isolated from these clones and subjected to sequencing to confirm the presence of the point mutations. The 2.2-kb apoA-I inserts containing the apoA-I mutant were cloned into the pAdTrack CMV vector that was used to generate the adenoviral constructs by recombination with the Ad-Easy-1 helper virus in the bacteria cells BJ-5183-pAD1(Stratagene), which contain the Ad-Easy-1 helper virus. Correct clones were propagated in DH5a bacteria cells. The recombinant adenoviral constructs were linearized after incubation with PacI and used to transfect 911 cells. Following large scale infection of human embryonic kidney 293 cell cultures, the recombinant adenoviruses were purified by two consecutive CsCl ultracentrifugation steps, dialyzed, and titrated. The mutant protein was isolate from the culture medium of HTB-13 cells infected with the apoA-I(L218A/L219A/V221A/L222A)-expressing adenovirus as described (22Chroni A. Liu T. Gorshkova I. Kan H.Y.

Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5697-5708Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Lyophilized apoA-I mutants were dissolved in 5 m guanidinium hydrochloride and dialyzed against 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.15 m NaCl. The iodination was carried out by the same procedure as described before for WT apoA-I adjusted to pH 8, and the extensive dialysis was against 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.15 m NaCl. ApoA-I was labeled with 125I using Iodination Beads (Pierce) and Na125I (Hartmann Analytic) according to the manufacturers' instructions. In a typical reaction, we used 0.5 mCi of Na125I, 0.7 mg of apoA-I, and two beads. Protein was separated from unincorporated 125I with a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences) followed by extensive dialysis (against 0.15 m NaCl, 0.3 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) to remove residual free iodine. The specific activity expressed as cpm/ng protein was calculated based on the protein concentration measured by the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) and the activity measured using a γ-counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Specific activities of 600–1200 cpm/ng protein were obtained. Discoidal rHDL particles were produced by the cholate dialysis method (18Lorenzi I. von Eckardstein A. Radosavljevic S. Rohrer L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1781: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and contained WT or mutant apoA-I, POPC (Sigma), and sodium cholate (Sigma) in a molar ratio of 1:40:100 ((mutant) ApoA-I 1:40). Reconstituted HDL was iodinated as described above for apoA-I. Electron microscopy analysis of the particles was performed as described (22Chroni A. Liu T. Gorshkova I. Kan H.Y. Uehara Y. Von Eckardstein A. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6719-6730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Binding and cell association assays with 125I-apoA-I or 125I-rHDL were performed as described previously (16Rohrer L. Cavelier C. Fuchs S. Schlüter M.A. Völker W. von Eckardstein A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). ECs were incubated with the indicated concentrations of 125I-apoA-I or 125I-rHDL without (total) or with (nonspecific) a 40-fold excess of the indicated competitor for 2 h at 4 °C (binding) or 1 h at 37 °C (cell association). Specific binding/cell association was calculated by subtracting the values of nonspecific binding/cell association from those of total binding/cell association. All experiments were performed at least in triplicate. Transport assays were performed as previously described (16Rohrer L. Cavelier C. Fuchs S. Schlüter M.A. Völker W. von Eckardstein A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In brief, ECs were seeded 2 days in advance on inserts (0.4 μm; BD Biosciences) precoated with collagen type I (BD Biosciences). Medium containing either 125I-apoA-I or 125I-rHDL at the indicated concentrations was added to the apical compartment together with (nonspecific transport) or in the absence (total transport) of a 40-fold excess of unlabeled apoA-I and rHDL, respectively. After incubation for 60 min at 37 °C the media of the basolateral compartment were collected to measure radioactivity. Specific transport was calculated by subtracting the values of nonspecific transport from those of total transport. The size of apoA-I and mutant apoA-I before and after transendothelial transport was analyzed by gel filtration chromatography as described (31Liu L. Bortnick A.E. Nickel M. Dhanasekaran P. Subbaiah P.V. Lund-Katz S. Rothblat G.H. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42976-42984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In brief, transport assays were performed in four transwell cell culture wells as described above. The media (2 ml) were isolated from the basolateral compartments, combined, and concentrated to 50 μl by centrifugal concentrators (Vivaspin 500; Sartorius Stedim Biotech). The concentrate was loaded onto a SuperdexTM 200 preparation grade HiLoadTM 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) of an Akta fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system and eluted with Tris saline (0.01 m Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and the amounts of transported radioactivity were determined using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences γ-counter. Equal amounts of proteins were used for mobility analysis and were loaded on a 1% native agarose gel (0.05 m barbital buffer, pH 8.6). Electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C. After that, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue (protein staining) and Sudan Black (lipid staining) using standard protocols. The data for all experiments were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism 5 software program. Comparisons between groups were performed using t test methods. Experiments were routinely performed in triplicate or quadruplicate. Each experiment shown is a representative of at least three similar experiments. If not indicated otherwise, the data are graphically represented as means ± S.D. Initially we compared the endothelial binding properties of WT apoA-I either isolated from plasma or produced as a recombinant protein. ECs were incubated with radiolabeled lipid-free WT apoA-I at 4 °C in the absence (total) or presence of a 40-fold excess of unlabeled plasma WT apoA-I (nonspecific). The difference between the total and the nonspecific binding corresponds to the specific binding. The recombinant and plasma-derived WT isoproteins of apoA-I showed the same total and specific binding to ECs. Therefore, in further experiments, plasma WT apoA-I was used as a control to compare the behavior of the different apoA-I mutants. The apoA-I(Δ144–165) mutant showed total and specific binding to ECs similar to those of WT apoA-I. The two mutants with a defective carboxyl-terminal sequence, apoA-I(Δ185–243) and apoA-I(L218A/L219A/V221A/L222A), showed 50 and 80% decreases in total and specific endothelial binding, respectively (Fig. 1). In contrast, apoA-I(Δ1–59) and apoA-I(Δ1–59/Δ185–243) showed a dramatic 25-fold increase in total binding. The binding of apoA-I(Δ1–59) could not be competed by unlabeled WT apoA-I so that no specific binding could be recorded (Fig. 1). The calculated specific binding of apoA-I(Δ1–59/Δ185–243) did not differ from that of WT apoA-I. We repeated these experiments at 37 °C where ligands are not only bound but also internalized by ECs (16Rohrer L. Cavelier C. Fuchs S. Schlüter M.A. Völker W. von Eckardstein A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32Lorenzi I. von Eckardstein A. Cavelier C. Radosavljevic S. Rohrer L. J Mol. Med. 2008; 86: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and therefore the absolute amount of cell-associated radioactivity is higher. In principle, we made the same observations as described for binding at 4 °C: WT apoA-I from plasma, recombinant WT apoA-I, and apoA-I(Δ144–165) did not differ from each other whereas the apoA-I(Δ185–243) and apoA-I(L218A/L219A/V221A/L222A) mutants showed strongly reduced total and specific cell association, and the apoA-I(Δ1–59) and apoA-I(Δ1–59/Δ185–243) mutants showed massively increased total cell association which could not be competed by WT apoA-I (data not shown). Next, we analyzed the transport of the different apoA-I mutants though ECs cultivated in a transwell system. Radiolabeled lipid-free WT or mutant apoA-I was added to the apical side with or without 40-fold excess of unlabeled competitor (WT apoA-I). After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the medium of the basolateral compartment was collected to measure radioactivity. The specific transport was calculated as the difference between total transport (radioactivity after incubation without competitor) and nonspecific transport (radioactivity after incubation with competitor). As shown in Fig. 2, specific transports of plasma WT apoA-I, recombinant WT apoA-I, and apoA-I(Δ144–165) were similar. In contrast, the specific transports of apoA-I(Δ185–243) and apoA-I(L218A/L219A/V221A/L222A) were decreased by 90%. No specific transports could be calculated for apoA-I(Δ1–59) and apoA-I(Δ1–59/Δ185–243) mutants because both in the presence or absence of the competitor the same amounts of radioactivity were recovered in the basolateral compartment of the transwell cell culture dish. In previous studies we observed a change in particle size and electrophoretic mobility of lipid-free WT apoA-I after the transport through ECs which we interpreted as a result of lipidation (16Rohrer L. Cavelier C. Fuchs S. Schlüter M.A. Völker W. von Eckardstein A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Cavelier C. Rohrer L. von Eckardstein A. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 1060-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Therefore, we compared the particle sizes of WT apoA-I and the dysfunctional apoA-I(L218A/L219A/V221A/L222A) mutant before and after transport through ECs (Fig. 3). After transport and recovery from the basolateral compartment, WT apoA-I was fractionated by gel filtration into two peaks, one peak with identical elution volume (87.6 ml ± 0.5 ml) and hence size of the starting material and one new peak with lower elution volume (72.6 ml ± 0.5 ml) and hence larger particle size (Fig. 3A). By contrast, the comparison of the gel filtration profiles of the binding- and transport-defective apoA-I(L218A/L219A/V221A/L222A) mutant before and after incubation with ECs did not reveal the occurrence of any new peak (Fig. 3B). Already before incubation with cells and hence in the lipid-free state, this mutant was eluted in two peaks, one with the size of WT apoA-I (87.6 ml ± 0.5 ml) and one corresponding to larger particle size (77.1 ml ± 0.5 ml). The larger sized fraction of apoA-I(L218A/L219A/V221A/L222A) has a higher elution volume than the fraction formed after transport of WT apoA-I and did not change after transport. We therefore assume that this fraction represents lipid-free aggregates of apoA-I(L218A/L219A/V221A/L222A). Using specific siRNAs (15Rohrer L. Ohnsorg P.M. Lehner M. Landolt F. Rinninger F. von Eckardstein A. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 1142-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), we investigated the effects of ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-BI knockdown alone and the silencing of both ABCA1 and ABCG1 together on endothelial binding, cell association, and transport of lipid-free WT apoA-I (Fig. 4). ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-BI transcription were reduced by approximately 80–90% in cells transfected with specific siRNA. The remaining protein expression of ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-BI after silencing was ∼50% as assessed by Western blotting and already shown previously (15Rohrer L. Ohnsorg P.M. Lehner M. Landolt F. Rinninger F. von Eckardstein A. Circ. Res. 2009; 104: 1142-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 17Cavelier C. Rohrer L. von Eckardstein A. Circ. Res. 2006; 99: 1060-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Also as reported previously, knockdown of ABCA1, but not ABCG1 or SR-BI, reduced the binding of lipid-free WT apoA-I at 4 °C (Fig. 4A). The knockdown of ABCA1 and ABCG1 together revealed the same reduction of apoA-I binding as the single knock-down of ABCA1 by approximately 60%. At 37 °C, suppression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 either individually or both together but not the knockdown of SR-BI diminished the cell association (Fig. 4B) and transendothelial transport of initially lipid-free apoA-I (Fig. 4C) by approximately 40%. These at first sight discrepant observations at 4 °C and 37 °C could be explained by a previously proposed two-step model in which ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux generates a lipidated particle that secondarily interacts with ABCG1 (18Lorenzi I. von Eckardstein A. Radosavljevic S. Rohrer L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1781: 306-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 19Vaughan A.M. Oram J.F. J.

Lipidol. 2006; 17: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis we analyzed the binding, association, and transport of HDL reconstituted artificially with WT or mutant apoA-I. We first compared the binding (at 4 °C) and association properties (at 37 °C) of WT apoA-I in either the lipid-free or prelipidiated forms. The binding of lipid-free apoA-I was competed by rHDL to a similar degree as by lipid-free apoA-I itself or native HDL (Fig. 5A). The binding of rHDL was not competed by lipid-free apoA-I but by both reconstituted and native HDL (Fig. 5A). Cell association experiments yielded similar findings. EC association of lipid-free apoA-I was competed with 40-fold excesses of unlabeled apoA-I, lipidated apoA-I, or HDL to a similar degree (Fig. 5B). Cell association of rHDL was competed with an excess of either rHDL or native HDL (Fig. 5B). By contrast with the binding experiment, we however observed that also lipid-free apoA-I competed the cell association of rHDL, although to less extent (approximately 35%) than rHDL or native HDL (approximately 60%). These observations provide further evidence that at 37 °C the lipidation of apoA-I by ABCA1 generates a lipidated particle that can then compete with the cellular interaction of prelipidated apoA-I. Next, we exploited the apoA-I(L218A/L219A/V221A/L222A) mutant with defects in ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux as well as specific endothelial binding and transport to test the hypothesis that transendothelial transport of lipid-free apoA-I occurs by a two-step mechanism in which apoA-I is first lipidated by ABCA1-dependent lipid efflux to then undergo ABCA1-independent transport through ECs. We first lipidated WT apoA-I or apoA-I(L218A/L219A/V221A/L222A). The li"

Its disruption causes severe obesity in mice and humans. cAMP-response element-binding protein 1 (CREB1) has been postulated to play an important role downstream of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R), but this hypothesis has never been confirmed in vivo. To test this, we generated mice that lack CREB1 in SIM1-expressing neurons, of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), which are known to be MC4R-positive. Interestingly, CREB1(ΔSIM1) mice developed obesity as a result of decreased energy expenditure and impairment in maintaining their core body temperature and not because of hyperphagia, defining a new role for CREB1 in the PVN. In addition, the lack of CREB1 in the PVN caused a reduction in vasopressin expression but did not affect adrenal or thyroid function. Surprisingly, MC4R function tested pharmacologically was normal in CREB1(ΔSIM1) mice, suggesting that CREB1 is not required for intact MC4R signaling. Thus CREB1 may affect other pathways that are implicated in the regulation of body weight."
https://openalex.org/W2007454804,"Lipoic acid is a covalently attached cofactor essential for the activity of 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases and the glycine cleavage system. In the absence of lipoic acid modification, the dehydrogenases are inactive, and aerobic metabolism is blocked. In Escherichia coli, two pathways for the attachment of lipoic acid exist, a de novo biosynthetic pathway dependent on the activities of the LipB and LipA proteins and a lipoic acid scavenging pathway catalyzed by the LplA protein. LipB is responsible for octanoylation of the E2 components of 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases to provide the substrates of LipA, an S-adenosyl-L-methionine radical enzyme that inserts two sulfur atoms into the octanoyl moiety to give the active lipoylated dehydrogenase complexes. We report that the intact pyruvate and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes specifically copurify with both LipB and LipA. Proteomic, genetic, and dehydrogenase activity data indicate that all of the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase components are present. In contrast, LplA, the lipoate protein ligase enzyme of lipoate salvage, shows no interaction with the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases. The interaction is specific to the dehydrogenases in that the third lipoic acid-requiring enzyme of Escherichia coli, the glycine cleavage system H protein, does not copurify with either LipA or LipB. Studies of LipB interaction with engineered variants of the E2 subunit of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase indicate that binding sites for LipB reside both in the lipoyl domain and catalytic core sequences. We also report that LipB forms a very tight, albeit noncovalent, complex with acyl carrier protein. These results indicate that lipoic acid is not only assembled on the dehydrogenase lipoyl domains but that the enzymes that catalyze the assembly are also present ""on site."""
https://openalex.org/W2007042110,"Human norepinephrine (NE) deficiency (or dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) deficiency) is a rare congenital disorder of primary autonomic failure, in which neurotransmitters NE and epinephrine are undetectable. Although potential pathogenic mutations, such as a common splice donor site mutation (IVS1+2T→C) and various missense mutations, in NE deficiency patients were identified, molecular mechanisms underlying this disease remain unknown. Here, we show that the IVS1+2T→C mutation results in a non-detectable level of DBH protein production and that all three missense mutations tested lead to the DBH protein being trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Supporting the view that mutant DBH induces an ER stress response, exogenous expression of mutant DBH dramatically induced expression of BiP, a master ER chaperone. Furthermore, we found that a pharmacological chaperone, glycerol, significantly rescued defective trafficking of mutant DBH proteins. Taken together, we propose that NE deficiency is caused by the combined abnormal processing of DBH mRNA and defective protein trafficking and that this disease could be treated by a pharmacological chaperone(s).

https://openalex.org/W2012316243,"Background Engagement of the β2 integrin, lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), results in stabilization of T cell mRNA transcripts containing AU-rich elements (AREs) by inducing rapid nuclear-to-cytosolic translocation of the RNA-stabilizing protein, HuR. However, little is known regarding integrin-induced signaling cascades that affect mRNA catabolism. This study examines the role of the GTPases, Rac 1 and Rac 2, and their downstream effectors, in the LFA-1-induced effects on mRNA. Methodology/Principal Findings Engagement of LFA-1 to its ligand, ICAM-1, in human peripheral T cells resulted in rapid activation of Rac1 and Rac2. siRNA-mediated knockdown of either Rac1 or Rac2 prevented LFA-1-stimulated stabilization of the labile transcripts encoding IFN-γ and TNF-α, and integrin mediated IFN-γ mRNA stabilization was absent in T cells obtained from Rac2 gene-deleted mice. LFA-1 engagement-induced translocation of HuR and stabilization of TNF- α mRNA was lost in Jurkat cells deficient in the Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav-1 (J.Vav1). The transfection of J.Vav1 cells with constitutively active Rac1 or Rac2 stabilized a labile β-globin reporter mRNA, in a HuR-dependent manner. Furthermore, LFA-1-mediated mRNA stabilization and HuR translocation in mouse splenic T cells was dependent on the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, MKK3, and its target MAP kinase p38MAPK, and lost in T cells obtained from MKK3 gene-deleted mice. Conclusions/Significance Collectively, these results demonstrate that LFA-1-induced stabilization of ARE-containing mRNAs in T cells is dependent on HuR, and occurs through the Vav-1, Rac1/2, MKK3 and p38MAPK signaling cascade. This pathway constitutes a molecular switch that enhances immune and pro-inflammatory gene expression in T cells undergoing adhesion at sites of activation and effector function."
https://openalex.org/W2149143663,"Loss of TGF-β-induced growth inhibition is a hallmark of many human tumors. Previous studies implied that activation of the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/cyclosome) is involved in the TGF-β signaling pathway, which facilitates the destruction of SnoN, a transcriptional co-suppressor, which leads in turn to the transactivation of TGF-β-responsive genes for cell cycle arrest. The function of APC was demonstrated in TGF-β signal transduction, but the mechanism by which it is activated in response to TGF-β signaling remains unclear. We report here that phosphorylation of Cdc27, a core subunit of APC, in response to TGF-β signaling can facilitate the activation of APC. We have demonstrated that casein kinase II (CKII) is involved in the phosphorylation of Cdc27 in response to TGF-β signaling. Depletion of CKII by shRNA abolishes the TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Cdc27 and subsequent degradation of SnoN. Disruptive mutation of Cdc27 (S154A) attenuates TGF-β-induced SnoN degradation. In addition, expression of a phosphorylation-resistant Cdc27 mutant significantly attenuates TGF-β-induced growth inhibition. Together, the results suggest that phosphorylation of Cdc27 by CKII is involved in TGF-β-induced activation of APC."
https://openalex.org/W2056519361,"Garlic (Allium sativum) has been valued in many cultures both for its health effects and as a culinary flavor enhancer. Garlic's chemical complexity is widely thought to be the source of its many health benefits, which include, but are not limited to, anti-platelet, procirculatory, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, neuro-protective, and anti-cancer effects. While a growing body of scientific evidence strongly upholds the herb's broad and potent capacity to influence health, the common mechanisms underlying these diverse effects remain disjointed and relatively poorly understood. We adopted a phenotype-driven approach to investigate the effects of garlic in a mouse model. We examined RBC indices and morphologies, spleen histochemistry, RBC half-lives and gene expression profiles, followed up by qPCR and immunoblot validation. The RBCs of garlic-fed mice register shorter half-lives than the control. But they have normal blood chemistry and RBC indices. Their spleens manifest increased heme oxygenase 1, higher levels of iron and bilirubin, and presumably higher CO, a pleiotropic gasotransmitter. Heat shock genes and those critical for erythropoiesis are elevated in spleens but not in bone marrow. The garlic-fed mice have lower plasma erythropoietin than the controls, however. Chronic exposure to CO of mice on garlic-free diet was sufficient to cause increased RBC indices but again with a lower plasma erythropoietin level than air-treated controls. Furthermore, dietary garlic supplementation and CO treatment showed additive effects on reducing plasma erythropoietin levels in mice. Thus, garlic consumption not only causes increased energy demand from the faster RBC turnover but also increases the production of CO, which in turn stimulates splenic erythropoiesis by an erythropoietin-independent mechanism, thus completing the sequence of feedback regulation for RBC metabolism. Being a pleiotropic gasotransmitter, CO may be a second messenger for garlic's other physiological effects."
https://openalex.org/W1968749102,"Archaeal lipid mucosal vaccine adjuvant and delivery (AMVAD) is a safe mucosal adjuvant that elicits long lasting and memory boostable mucosal and systemic immune responses to model antigens such as ovalbumin. In this study, we evaluated the potential of the AMVAD system for eliciting protective immunity against mucosal bacterial infections, using a mouse model of intranasal Francisella tularensis LVS (LVS) challenge. Intranasal immunization of mice with cell free extract of LVS (LVSCE) adjuvanted with the AMVAD system (LVSCE/AMVAD) induced F. tularensis-specific antibody responses in sera and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, as well as antigen-specific splenocyte proliferation and IL-17 production. More importantly, the AMVAD vaccine partially protected the mice against a lethal intranasal challenge with LVS. Compared to LVSCE immunized and naïve mice, the LVSCE/AMVAD immunized mice showed substantial to significant reduction in pathogen burdens in the lungs and spleens, reduced serum and pulmonary levels of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, and longer mean time to death as well as significantly higher survival rates (p<0.05). These results suggest that the AMVAD system is a promising mucosal adjuvant and vaccine delivery technology, and should be explored further for its applications in combating mucosal infectious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2076872462,"Background We examined species composition of forest and bird communities in relation to environmental and human disturbance gradients on Lakeba (55.9 km2), Nayau (18.4 km2), and Aiwa Levu (1.2 km2), islands in the Lau Group of Fiji, West Polynesia. The unique avifauna of West Polynesia (Fiji, Tonga, Samoa) has been subjected to prehistoric human-caused extinctions but little was previously known about this topic in the Lau Group. We expected that the degree of human disturbance would be a strong determinant of tree species composition and habitat quality for surviving landbirds, while island area would be unrelated to bird diversity. Methodology/Principal Findings All trees >5 cm diameter were measured and identified in 23 forest plots of 500 m2 each. We recognized four forest species assemblages differentiated by composition and structure: coastal forest, dominated by widely distributed species, and three forest types with differences related more to disturbance history (stages of secondary succession following clearing or selective logging) than to environmental gradients (elevation, slope, rockiness). Our point counts (73 locations in 1 or 2 seasons) recorded 18 of the 24 species of landbirds that exist on the three islands. The relative abundance and species richness of birds were greatest in the forested habitats least disturbed by people. These differences were due mostly to increased numbers of columbid frugivores and passerine insectivores in forests on Lakeba and Aiwa Levu. Considering only forested habitats, the relative abundance and species richness of birds were greater on the small but completely forested (and uninhabited) island of Aiwa Levu than on the much larger island of Lakeba. Conclusions/Significance Forest disturbance history is more important than island area in structuring both tree and landbird communities on remote Pacific islands. Even very small islands may be suitable for conservation reserves if they are protected from human disturbance."
https://openalex.org/W2005580929,"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections could be one of the causes of fetal morbimortality in pregnant women. The main virulence factors of STEC are Shiga toxin type 1 and/or 2 (Stx1, Stx2). We previously reported that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of rats in the late stage of pregnancy with culture supernatant from recombinant E. coli expressing Stx2 and containing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces premature delivery of dead fetuses. It has been reported that LPS may combine with Stx2 to facilitate vascular injury, which may in turn lead to an overproduction of nitric oxide (NO). The aim of this study was to evaluate whether NO is involved in the effects of Stx2 on pregnancy. Pregnant rats were i.p. injected with culture supernatant from recombinant E. coli containing Stx2 and LPS (sStx2) on day 15 of gestation. In addition, some rats were injected with aminoguanidine (AG), an inducible isoform inhibitor of NO synthase (iNOS), 24 h before and 4 h after sStx2 injection. NO production was measured by NOS activity and iNOS expression by Western blot analysis. A significant increase in NO production and a high iNOS expression was observed in placental tissues from rats injected with sStx2 containing 0.7 ng and 2 ng Stx2/g body weight and killed 12 h after injection. AG caused a significant reduction of sStx2 effects on the feto-maternal unit, but did not prevent premature delivery. Placental tissues from rats treated with AG and sStx2 presented normal histology that was indistinguishable from the controls. Our results reveal that Stx2-induced placental damage and fetus mortality is mediated by an increase in NO production and that AG is able to completely reverse the Stx2 damages in placental tissues, but not to prevent premature delivery, thus suggesting other mechanisms not yet determined could be involved."
https://openalex.org/W2158573399,"Conventional assays for quantification of allo-reactive T-cell precursor frequencies (PF) are relatively insensitive. We present a robust assay for quantification of PF of T-cells with direct donor-specificity, and establish the kinetics of circulating donor-specific T cells after liver transplantation (LTx). B cells from donor splenocytes were differentiated into professional antigen-presenting cells by CD40-engagement (CD40-B cells). CFSE-labelled PBMC from LTx-recipients obtained before and at several time points after LTx, were stimulated with donor-derived or 3rd party CD40-B cells. PF of donor-specific T cells were calculated from CFSE-dilution patterns, and intracellular IFN-γ was determined after re-stimulation with CD40-B cells. Compared to splenocytes, stimulations with CD40-B cells resulted in 3 to 5-fold higher responding T-cell PF. Memory and naïve T-cell subsets responded equally to allogeneic CD40-B cell stimulation. Donor-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell PF ranged from 0.5 to 19% (median: 5.2%). One week after LTx, PF of circulating donor-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells increased significantly, while only a minor increase in numbers of T cells reacting to 3rd party allo-antigens was observed. One year after LTx numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells reacting to donor antigens, as well as those reacting to 3rd party allo-antigens, were slightly lower compared to pre-transplant values. Moreover, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells responding to donor-derived, as well as those reacting to 3rd party CD40-B cells, produced less IFN-γ. In conclusion, our alternative approach enables detection of allo-reactive human T cells at high frequencies, and after application we conclude that donor-specific T-cell PF increase immediately after LTx. However, no evidence for a specific loss of circulating T-cells recognizing donor allo-antigens via the direct pathway up to 1 year after LTx was obtained, underscoring the relative insensitiveness of previous assays."
https://openalex.org/W2027869243,"Malaria and bacterial infections account for most infectious disease deaths in developing countries. Prompt treatment saves lives, but rapid deterioration often prevents the use of oral therapies; delays in reaching health facilities providing parenteral interventions are common. Rapidly and reliably absorbed antimalarial/antibacterial rectal formulations used in the community could prevent deaths and disabilities. Rectal antimalarial treatments are currently available; rectal antibacterial treatments are yet to be developed. Assessment of the likely cost-effectiveness of these interventions will inform research priorities and implementation.The burden of malaria and bacterial infections worldwide and in Sub-Saharan and Southern Africa (SSA) and South and South-East Asia (SEA) was summarised using published data. The additional healthcare costs (US$) per death and per Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) avoided following pre-referral treatment of severe febrile illness with rectal antimalarials, antibacterials or combined antimalarial/antibacterials in populations at malaria risk in SSA/SEA were assessed. 46 million severe malaria and bacterial infections and 5 million deaths occur worldwide each year, mostly in SSA/SEA. At annual delivery costs of $0.02/capita and 100% coverage, rectal antimalarials ($2 per dose) would avert 240,000 deaths in SSA and 7,000 deaths in SEA at $5 and $177 per DALY avoided, respectively; rectal antibacterials ($2 per dose) would avert 130,000 deaths in SSA and 27,000 deaths in SEA at $19 and $97 per DALY avoided, respectively. Combined rectal formulations ($2.50 per dose) would avert 370,000 deaths in SSA and 33,000 deaths in SEA at $8 and $79 per DALY avoided, respectively, and are a cost-effective alternative to rectal antimalarials or antibacterials alone.Antimalarial, antibacterial and combined rectal formulations are likely to be cost-effective interventions for severe febrile illness in the community. Attention should focus on developing effective rectal antibacterials and ensuring that these lifesaving treatments are used in a cost-effective manner."
https://openalex.org/W2069294884,"We developed a label-free method for a determination of the number of biomolecules attached to individual cells by measuring the electrophoretic mobility of the cells in a microchannel. The surface of a biological cell, which is dispersed in aqueous solution, is normally electrically charged and the charge quantity at the cell's surface is slightly changed once antibody molecules are attached to the cell, based on which we detect the attachment of antibody molecules to the surface of individual red blood cells by electrophoretic mobility measurement. We also analyzed the number of antibody molecules attached to the cell's surface using a flow cytometer. We found that there is a clear correlation between the number of antibody molecules attached to the individual cells and the electrophoretic mobility of the cells. The present technique may well be utilized not only in the field of cell biology but also in the medical and pharmaceutical industries."
