https://openalex.org/W2297994856,"David Ellinghaus and colleagues report a combined association analysis of five chronic inflammatory diseases. They identify 27 new associations and highlight disease-specific association patterns at shared susceptibility loci. We simultaneously investigated the genetic landscape of ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis to investigate pleiotropy and the relationship between these clinically related diseases. Using high-density genotype data from more than 86,000 individuals of European ancestry, we identified 244 independent multidisease signals, including 27 new genome-wide significant susceptibility loci and 3 unreported shared risk loci. Complex pleiotropy was supported when contrasting multidisease signals with expression data sets from human, rat and mouse together with epigenetic and expressed enhancer profiles. The comorbidities among the five immune diseases were best explained by biological pleiotropy rather than heterogeneity (a subgroup of cases genetically identical to those with another disease, possibly owing to diagnostic misclassification, molecular subtypes or excessive comorbidity). In particular, the strong comorbidity between primary sclerosing cholangitis and inflammatory bowel disease is likely the result of a unique disease, which is genetically distinct from classical inflammatory bowel disease phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2293646973,"Amino acids signal to the mTOR complex I (mTORC1) growth pathway through the Rag GTPases. Multiple distinct complexes regulate the Rags, including GATOR1, a GTPase activating protein (GAP), and GATOR2, a positive regulator of unknown molecular function. Arginine stimulation of cells activates mTORC1, but how it is sensed is not well understood. Recently, SLC38A9 was identified as a putative lysosomal arginine sensor required for arginine to activate mTORC1 but how arginine deprivation represses mTORC1 is unknown. Here, we show that CASTOR1, a previously uncharacterized protein, interacts with GATOR2 and is required for arginine deprivation to inhibit mTORC1. CASTOR1 homodimerizes and can also heterodimerize with the related protein, CASTOR2. Arginine disrupts the CASTOR1-GATOR2 complex by binding to CASTOR1 with a dissociation constant of ∼30 μM, and its arginine-binding capacity is required for arginine to activate mTORC1 in cells. Collectively, these results establish CASTOR1 as an arginine sensor for the mTORC1 pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2298943387,"The efficacy of cancer drugs is often limited because only a small fraction of the administered dose accumulates in tumors. Here we report an injectable nanoparticle generator (iNPG) that overcomes multiple biological barriers to cancer drug delivery. The iNPG is a discoidal micrometer-sized particle that can be loaded with chemotherapeutics. We conjugate doxorubicin to poly(L-glutamic acid) by means of a pH-sensitive cleavable linker, and load the polymeric drug (pDox) into iNPG to assemble iNPG-pDox. Once released from iNPG, pDox spontaneously forms nanometer-sized particles in aqueous solution. Intravenously injected iNPG-pDox accumulates at tumors due to natural tropism and enhanced vascular dynamics and releases pDox nanoparticles that are internalized by tumor cells. Intracellularly, pDox nanoparticles are transported to the perinuclear region and cleaved into Dox, thereby avoiding excretion by drug efflux pumps. Compared to its individual components or current therapeutic formulations, iNPG-pDox shows enhanced efficacy in MDA-MB-231 and 4T1 mouse models of metastatic breast cancer, including functional cures in 40-50% of treated mice."
https://openalex.org/W2298457819,"Tissues with high metabolic rates often use lipids, as well as glucose, for energy, conferring a survival advantage during feast and famine. Current dogma suggests that high-energy-consuming photoreceptors depend on glucose. Here we show that the retina also uses fatty acid β-oxidation for energy. Moreover, we identify a lipid sensor, free fatty acid receptor 1 (Ffar1), that curbs glucose uptake when fatty acids are available. Very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (Vldlr), which is present in photoreceptors and is expressed in other tissues with a high metabolic rate, facilitates the uptake of triglyceride-derived fatty acid. In the retinas of Vldlr(-/-) mice with low fatty acid uptake but high circulating lipid levels, we found that Ffar1 suppresses expression of the glucose transporter Glut1. Impaired glucose entry into photoreceptors results in a dual (lipid and glucose) fuel shortage and a reduction in the levels of the Krebs cycle intermediate α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). Low α-KG levels promotes stabilization of hypoxia-induced factor 1a (Hif1a) and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor A (Vegfa) by starved Vldlr(-/-) photoreceptors, leading to neovascularization. The aberrant vessels in the Vldlr(-/-) retinas, which invade normally avascular photoreceptors, are reminiscent of the vascular defects in retinal angiomatous proliferation, a subset of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is associated with high vitreous VEGFA levels in humans. Dysregulated lipid and glucose photoreceptor energy metabolism may therefore be a driving force in macular telangiectasia, neovascular AMD and other retinal diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2298433114,"Growing numbers of mental health organizations are developing community music-making interventions for service users; however, to date there has been little research into their efficacy or mechanisms of effect. This study was an exploratory examination of whether 10 weeks of group drumming could improve depression, anxiety and social resilience among service users compared with a non-music control group (with participants allocated to group by geographical location.) Significant improvements were found in the drumming group but not the control group: by week 6 there were decreases in depression (-2.14 SE 0.50 CI -3.16 to -1.11) and increases in social resilience (7.69 SE 2.00 CI 3.60 to 11.78), and by week 10 these had further improved (depression: -3.41 SE 0.62 CI -4.68 to -2.15; social resilience: 10.59 SE 1.78 CI 6.94 to 14.24) alongside significant improvements in anxiety (-2.21 SE 0.50 CI -3.24 to -1.19) and mental wellbeing (6.14 SE 0.92 CI 4.25 to 8.04). All significant changes were maintained at 3 months follow-up. Furthermore, it is now recognised that many mental health conditions are characterised by underlying inflammatory immune responses. Consequently, participants in the drumming group also provided saliva samples to test for cortisol and the cytokines interleukin (IL) 4, IL6, IL17, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) 1. Across the 10 weeks there was a shift away from a pro-inflammatory towards an anti-inflammatory immune profile. Consequently, this study demonstrates the psychological benefits of group drumming and also suggests underlying biological effects, supporting its therapeutic potential for mental health.

https://openalex.org/W2300592511,"Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway and a potent tumor suppressor in many types of cancer. To test a tumor suppressive role for PTEN in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we induced Cre-mediated deletion of Pten in mouse models of pre-B ALL. In contrast to its role as a tumor suppressor in other cancers, loss of one or both alleles of Pten caused rapid cell death of pre-B ALL cells and was sufficient to clear transplant recipient mice of leukemia. Small-molecule inhibition of PTEN in human pre-B ALL cells resulted in hyperactivation of AKT, activation of the p53 tumor suppressor cell cycle checkpoint and cell death. Loss of PTEN function in pre-B ALL cells was functionally equivalent to acute activation of autoreactive pre-B cell receptor signaling, which engaged a deletional checkpoint for the removal of autoreactive B cells. We propose that targeted inhibition of PTEN and hyperactivation of AKT triggers a checkpoint for the elimination of autoreactive B cells and represents a new strategy to overcome drug resistance in human ALL."
https://openalex.org/W2298343163,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered to be responsible for treatment relapse and have therefore become a major target in cancer research. Salinomycin is the most established CSC inhibitor. However, its primary mechanistic target is still unclear, impeding the discovery of compounds with similar anti-CSC activity. Here, we show that salinomycin very specifically interferes with the activity of K-ras4B, but not H-ras, by disrupting its nanoscale membrane organization. We found that caveolae negatively regulate the sensitivity to this drug. On the basis of this novel mechanistic insight, we defined a K-ras-associated and stem cell-derived gene expression signature that predicts the drug response of cancer cells to salinomycin. Consistent with therapy resistance of CSC, 8% of tumor samples in the TCGA-database displayed our signature and were associated with a significantly higher mortality. Using our K-ras-specific screening platform, we identified several new candidate CSC drugs. Two of these, ophiobolin A and conglobatin A, possessed a similar or higher potency than salinomycin. Finally, we established that the most potent compound, ophiobolin A, exerts its K-ras4B-specific activity through inactivation of calmodulin. Our data suggest that specific interference with the K-ras4B/calmodulin interaction selectively inhibits CSC."
https://openalex.org/W2299463430,"In a rat model of spinal cord injury, calpain-dependent cleavage of motoneuron sodium channels can be pharmacologically targeted to achieve long-lasting amelioration of spasticity. Upregulation of the persistent sodium current (INaP) in motoneurons contributes to the development of spasticity after spinal cord injury (SCI). We investigated the mechanisms that regulate INaP and observed elevated expression of voltage-gated sodium (Nav) 1.6 channels in spinal lumbar motoneurons of adult rats with SCI. Furthermore, immunoblots revealed a proteolysis of Nav channels, and biochemical assays identified calpain as the main proteolytic factor. Calpain-dependent cleavage of Nav channels after neonatal SCI was associated with an upregulation of INaP in motoneurons. Similarly, the calpain-dependent cleavage of Nav1.6 channels expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells caused the upregulation of INaP. The pharmacological inhibition of calpain activity by MDL28170 reduced the cleavage of Nav channels, INaP in motoneurons and spasticity in rats with SCI. Similarly, the blockade of INaP by riluzole alleviated spasticity. This study demonstrates that Nav channel expression in lumbar motoneurons is altered after SCI, and it shows a tight relationship between the calpain-dependent proteolysis of Nav1.6 channels, the upregulation of INaP and spasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2298930097,"Colon carcinogenesis is a multiple-step process involving the accumulation of a series of genetic and epigenetic alterations. The most commonly initiating event of intestinal carcinogenesis is mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, which leads to activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) has emerged as an intestinal stem-cell marker, but its biological function in the intestine remains to be determined. Here we show that Olfm4 deletion induced colon adenocarcinoma in the distal colon of ApcMin/+ mice. Mechanistically, we found that OLFM4 is a target gene of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and can downregulate β-catenin signaling by competing with Wnt ligands for binding to Frizzled receptors, as well as by inhibition of the Akt-GSK-3β (Akt-glycogen synthase kinase-3β) pathway. We have shown that both Wnt and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling were boosted in tumor tissues of Apc Olfm4 double-mutant mice. These data establish OLFM4 as a critical negative regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB pathways that inhibits colon-cancer development initiated by APC mutation. In addition, Olfm4 deletion significantly enhanced intestinal-crypt proliferation and inflammation induced by azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate. Thus, OLFM4 has an important role in the regulation of intestinal inflammation and tumorigenesis, and could be a potential therapeutic target for intestinal malignant tumors. Unlike the human colonic epithelium, the mouse colonic epithelium does not express OLFM4, but nevertheless, systemic OLFM4 deletion promotes colon tumorigenesis and that loss from mucosal neutrophils may have a role to play."
https://openalex.org/W2299269284,"Live attenuated oral vaccines against rotavirus (RV) have been shown to be less efficacious in children from developing countries. Reasons for this disparity are not fully understood. We assessed the role of maternal factors including breast milk RV-specific IgA, transplacentally acquired infant serum RV-specific IgG and maternal HIV status in seroconversion among Zambian infants routinely immunized with Rotarix™ (RV1).420 mother-child pairs were recruited at infant age 6-12 weeks in Lusaka. Clinical information and samples were collected at baseline and at one month following the second dose of RV1. Determination of breast milk RV-specific IgA and serum RV-specific IgA and IgG was done using standardized ELISA. Seroconversion was defined as a ≥ 4 fold rise in serum IgA titre from baseline to one-month post RV1 dose 2, while seropositivity of IgA was defined as serum titre ≥ 40 and antibody variables were modelled on log-base 2. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of the odds of seroconversion.Baseline infant seropositivity was 25.5% (91/357). The seroconversion frequency was 60.2% (130/216). Infants who were IgA seropositive at baseline were less likely to seroconvert compared to their seronegative counterparts (P = 0.04). There was no evidence of an association between maternal HIV status and seroconversion (P = 0.25). Higher titres of breast milk rotavirus-specific IgA were associated with a lower frequency of seroconverson (Nonparametric test for trend Z = -2.84; P<0.01): a two-fold increase in breast milk RV-specific IgA titres was associated with a 22% lower odds of seroconversion (OR = 0.80; 95% CI = 0.68-0.94; P = 0.01). There was seasonal variation in baseline breast milk rotavirus-specific IgA titres, with significantly higher GMTs during the cold dry months (P = 0.01).Low immunogenicity of RV1 vaccine could be explained in part by exposure to high antibody titres in breast milk and early exposure to wild-type rotavirus infections. Potential interference of anti-RV specific IgA in breast milk and pre-vaccination serum RV specific-IgA and IgG titres with RV1 seroconversion and effectiveness requires further research."
https://openalex.org/W2301585873,"The transcription factor Twist1 is involved in the epithelial–mesenchymal transition and contributes to cancer metastasis through mostly unknown mechanisms. In colorectal cancer, Twist1 expression is mainly restricted to the tumor stroma. We found that human fibroblast cell lines stably transfected with Twist1 acquired characteristics of activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), such as hyperproliferation, an increased ability to migrate and an alignment of the actin cytoskeleton. Further, Twist1-activated fibroblasts promoted increased matrix stiffness. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified palladin and collagen α1(VI) as two major mediators of the Twist1 effects in fibroblast cell lines. Co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated that palladin and Twist1 interact within the nucleus, suggesting that palladin could act as a transcription regulator. Palladin was found to be more relevant for the cellular biomechanical properties, orientation and polarity, and collagen α1(VI) for the migration and invasion capacity, of Twist1-activated fibroblasts. Both palladin and collagen α1(VI) were observed to be overexpressed in colorectal CAFs and to be associated with poor colorectal cancer patient survival and relapse prediction. Our results demonstrate that Twist1-expressing fibroblasts mimic the properties of CAFs present at the tumor invasive front, which likely explains the prometastatic activities of Twist1. Twist1 appears to require both palladin and collagen α1(VI) as downstream effectors for its prometastatic effects, which could be future therapeutic targets in cancer metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2297238702,"Recently, an extensive study of 2,748 polar bears (Ursus maritimus) from across their circumpolar range was published in PLOS ONE, which used microsatellites and mitochondrial haplotypes to apparently show altered population structure and a dramatic change in directional gene flow towards the Canadian Archipelago—an area believed to be a future refugium for polar bears as their southernmost habitats decline under climate change. Although this study represents a major international collaborative effort and promised to be a baseline for future genetics work, methodological shortcomings and errors of interpretation undermine some of the study’s main conclusions. Here, we present a reanalysis of this data in which we address some of these issues, including: (1) highly unbalanced sample sizes and large amounts of systematically missing data; (2) incorrect calculation of FST and of significance levels; (3) misleading estimates of recent gene flow resulting from non-convergence of the program BayesAss. In contrast to the original findings, in our reanalysis we find six genetic clusters of polar bears worldwide: the Hudson Bay Complex, the Western and Eastern Canadian Arctic Archipelago, the Western and Eastern Polar Basin, and—importantly—we reconfirm the presence of a unique and possibly endangered cluster of bears in Norwegian Bay near Canada’s expected last sea-ice refugium. Although polar bears’ abundance, distribution, and population structure will certainly be negatively affected by ongoing—and increasingly rapid—loss of Arctic sea ice, these genetic data provide no evidence of strong directional gene flow in response to recent climate change."
https://openalex.org/W2297445915,"In addition to protein-coding genes, the human genome makes a large amount of noncoding RNAs. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been described as the largest subclass of the non-coding transcriptome in human noncoding RNAs. In recent years, lncRNAs have been considered to be the key regulators of tumor behavior. In this study, based on previous research, we investigated the expression and biological role of a newly identified cancer-related lncRNA, lncRNA-uc002kmd.1. We analyzed the relationship between lncRNA-uc002kmd.1 and colorectal cancer (CRC) in a total 45 CRC and paired adjacent, non-tumor tissue samples. We found that lncRNA-uc002kmd.1 expression was usually highly expressed in carcinoma compared with the tissue adjacent to the carcinoma. Through a series of experiments, the results showed that lncRNA-uc002kmd.1 regulates CD44 as a molecular decoy for miR211-3p. Our data indicated that the overexpression of lncRNA-uc002kmd.1 enhanced cell proliferation in CRC."
https://openalex.org/W2299289026,"The NTP-dependent DExH/D-box helicase DHX9 is a key participant in a number of gene regulatory steps, including transcriptional, translational, and microRNA-mediated control, DNA replication and maintenance of genomic stability. DHX9 has also been implicated in tumor cell maintenance and drug response. Here we report that inhibition of DHX9 expression is lethal to human cancer cell lines and murine Eμ−Myc lymphomas. Using a novel conditional shDHX9 mouse model, we demonstrate that sustained and prolonged (6 months) suppression of DHX9 does not result in any deleterious effects at the organismal level. Body weight, blood biochemistry and histology of various tissues were comparable to control mice. Global gene expression profiling revealed that, although reduction of DHX9 expression resulted in multiple transcriptome changes, these were relatively benign and did not lead to any discernible phenotype. Our results demonstrate a robust tolerance for systemic DHX9 suppression in vivo and support the targeting of DHX9 as an effective and specific chemotherapeutic approach."
https://openalex.org/W2297520752,"A data-driven hypothesis-free genome-wide association (GWA) approach in imaging genetics studies allows screening the entire genome to discover novel genes that modulate brain structure, chemistry, and function. However, a whole brain voxel-wise analysis approach in such genome-wide based imaging genetic studies can be computationally intense and also likely has low statistical power since a stringent multiple comparisons correction is needed for searching over the entire genome and brain. In imaging genetics with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) phenotypes, since many experimental paradigms activate focal regions that can be pre-specified based on a priori knowledge, reducing the voxel-wise search to single-value summary measures within a priori ROIs could prove efficient and promising. The goal of this investigation is to evaluate the sensitivity and reliability of different single-value ROI summary measures and provide guidance in future work. Four different fMRI databases were tested and comparisons across different groups (patients with schizophrenia, their siblings, vs. normal control subjects; across genotype groups) were conducted. Our results show that four of these measures, particularly those that represent values from the top most-activated voxels within an ROI are more powerful at reliably detecting group differences and generating greater effect sizes than the others."
https://openalex.org/W2415396647,"Purpose This study was conducted in order to compare relationships between the macular visual field (VF) mean sensitivity measured by MAIATM (Macular Integrity Assessment), MP-3, or Humphry field analyzer (HFA) and the ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer (GCA) thicknesses. Methods This cross-sectional study examined 73 glaucoma patients and 19 normal subjects. All subjects underwent measurements for GCA thickness by Cirrus HD-OCT and static threshold perimetry using MAIATM, MP-3, or HFA. VF and OCT in the retinal view were used to examine both the global relationship between the VF sensitivity and GCA thickness, and the superior hemiretina and inferior hemiretina. The relationship between the GCA thickness and macular sensitivity was examined by Spearman correlation analysis. Results For each instrument, statistically significant macular VF sensitivity (dB) and GCA thickness relationships were observed using the decibel scale (R = 0.547–0.687, all P < 0.001). The highest correlation for the global (R = 0.682) and the superior hemiretina (R = 0.594) GCA thickness-VF mean sensitivity was observed by the HFA. The highest correlation for the inferior hemiretina (R = 0.687) GCA thickness-VF mean sensitivity was observed by the MP-3. Among the three VF measurement instruments, however, no significant differences were found for the structure-function relationships. Conclusions All three VF measurement instruments found similar structure-function relationships in the central VF."
https://openalex.org/W2299139921,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a severe and currently incurable progressive neuromuscular condition, caused by mutations in the DMD gene that result in the inability to produce dystrophin. Lack of dystrophin leads to loss of muscle fibres and a reduction in muscle mass and function. There is evidence from dystrophin-deficient mouse models that increasing levels of utrophin at the muscle fibre sarcolemma by genetic or pharmacological means significantly reduces the muscular dystrophy pathology. In order to determine the efficacy of utrophin modulators in clinical trials, it is necessary to accurately measure utrophin levels and other biomarkers on a fibre by fibre basis within a biopsy section. Our aim was to develop robust and reproducible staining and imaging protocols to quantify sarcolemmal utrophin levels, sarcolemmal dystrophin complex members and numbers of regenerating fibres within a biopsy section. We quantified sarcolemmal utrophin in mature and regenerating fibres and the percentage of regenerating muscle fibres, in muscle biopsies from Duchenne, the milder Becker muscular dystrophy and controls. Fluorescent immunostaining followed by image analysis was performed to quantify utrophin intensity and β-dystrogylcan and ɣ –sarcoglycan intensity at the sarcolemma. Antibodies to fetal and developmental myosins were used to identify regenerating muscle fibres allowing the accurate calculation of percentage regeneration fibres in the biopsy. Our results indicate that muscle biopsies from Becker muscular dystrophy patients have fewer numbers of regenerating fibres and reduced utrophin intensity compared to muscle biopsies from Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients. Of particular interest, we show for the first time that the percentage of regenerating muscle fibres within the muscle biopsy correlate with the clinical severity of Becker and Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients from whom the biopsy was taken. The ongoing development of these tools to quantify sarcolemmal utrophin and muscle regeneration in muscle biopsies will be invaluable for assessing utrophin modulator activity in future clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2297482401,"The expression of immediate early response 3 (IER3), a protein with a short half-life, is rapidly induced by various cellular stimuli. We recently reported that IER3 induces the apoptosis of cervical cancer cells and that its expression is downregulated in patients with cervical cancer. However, the molecular mechanism involved in the rapid degradation of IER3 remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that MDM2 is an E3 ligase that interacts with IER3 and promotes its ubiquitination, followed by proteasomal degradation. Polyubiquitination of the conserved lysine 60 of IER3 is essential for its degradation. In addition, four and a half LIM domains protein 2 (FHL2) binds to both IER3 and MDM2, allowing for efficient MDM2-mediated IER3 degradation by facilitating an association between MDM2 and IER3. Moreover, IER3 induces cell cycle arrest in cervical cancer cells and its activity is further enhanced in cells in which FHL2 or MDM2 was silenced, thereby preventing IER3 degradation. The E6 and E7 oncoproteins of human papilloma virus 18 regulated IER3 expression. FHL2 expression was significantly higher in the squamous epithelium of cervical carcinoma tissues than in non-cancerous cervical tissues, whereas cervical carcinoma expression of IER3 was downregulated in this region. Thus, we determined the molecular mechanism responsible for IER3 degradation, involving a ternary complex of IER3, MDM2 and FHL2, which may contribute to cervical tumor growth. Furthermore, we demonstrated that FHL2 serves as a scaffold for E3 ligase and its substrate during the ubiquitination reaction, a function that has not been previously reported for this protein."
https://openalex.org/W2301847182,"Axial spondylometaphyseal dysplasia (axial SMD) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by dysplasia of axial skeleton and retinal dystrophy. We conducted whole exome sequencing and identified C21orf2 (chromosome 21 open reading frame 2) as a disease gene for axial SMD. C21orf2 mutations have been recently found to cause isolated retinal degeneration and Jeune syndrome. We found a total of five biallelic C21orf2 mutations in six families out of nine: three missense and two splicing mutations in patients with various ethnic backgrounds. The pathogenic effects of the splicing (splice-site and branch-point) mutations were confirmed on RNA level, which showed complex patterns of abnormal splicing. C21orf2 mutations presented with a wide range of skeletal phenotypes, including cupped and flared anterior ends of ribs, lacy ilia and metaphyseal dysplasia of proximal femora. Analysis of patients without C21orf2 mutation indicated genetic heterogeneity of axial SMD. Functional data in chondrocyte suggest C21orf2 is implicated in cartilage differentiation. C21orf2 protein was localized to the connecting cilium of the cone and rod photoreceptors, confirming its significance in retinal function. Our study indicates that axial SMD is a member of a unique group of ciliopathy affecting skeleton and retina."
https://openalex.org/W2293723928,"Mitochondrial alterations induced by oncogenes are known to be crucial for tumorigenesis. Ras oncogene leads to proliferative signals through a Raf-1/MEK/ERK kinase cascade, whose components have been found to be also associated with mitochondria. The mitochondrial pepdidyl-prolyl isomerase cyclophilin D (CypD) is an important regulator of the mitochondrial permeability transition and a key player in mitochondria physiology; however, its role in cancer is still unclear. Using cellular and in vivo mouse models, we demonstrated that CypD protein upregulation induced by oncogenic Ras through the Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway has a deterministic role in tumor progression. In fact, targeting CypD gene expression clearly affected RasV12-induced transformation, as showed by in vitro data on murine NIH3T3 and human MCF10A mammary epithelial cells. In addition, studies in xenograft and K-Ras lung cancer mouse models demonstrated that genetic deletion or pharmacological suppression of CypD efficiently prevented Ras-dependent tumor formation. Furthermore, Erbb2-mediated breast tumorigenesis was similarly prevented by targeting CypD. From a mechanistic point of view, CypD expression was associated with a reduced induction of p21WAF1/CIP1 and p53 functions, unraveling an antagonistic function of CypD on p21–p53-mediated growth suppression. CypD activity is p53 dependent. Interestingly, a physical association between p53 and CypD was detected in mitochondria of MCF10A cells; furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo studies proved that CypD inhibitor-based treatment was able to efficiently impair this interaction, leading to a tumor formation reduction. All together, these findings indicate that the countering effect of CypD on the p53–p21 pathway participates in oncogene-dependent transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2300936249,"Though hypoxia has been implicated as a cause of inflammation, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Folic acid has been shown to provide protection against oxidative stress and inflammation in patients with cardiovascular disease and various models approximating insult to tissue via inflammation. It has been reported that hypoxia-induced inflammation is associated with oxidative stress, upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), and production of pro-inflammatory molecules. Whether folic acid protects human monocytic cells (THP-1 cells) against hypoxia-induced damage, however, remains unknown. We used THP-1 cells to establish a hypoxia-induced cellular injury model. Pretreating THP-1 cells with folic acid attenuated hypoxia-induced inflammatory responses, including a decrease in protein and mRNA levels of interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), coupled with increased levels of IL-10. Folic acid also reduced hypoxia-induced Akt phosphorylation and decreased nuclear accumulation of HIF-1α protein. Both LY294002 (a selective inhibitor of phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase, PI3K) and KC7F2 (a HIF-1α inhibitor) reduced levels of hypoxia-induced inflammatory cytokines. We also found that insulin (an Akt activator) and dimethyloxallyl glycine (DMOG, a HIF-1α activator) induced over-expression of inflammatory cytokines, which could be blocked by folic acid. Taken together, these findings demonstrate how folic acid attenuates the hypoxia-induced inflammatory responses of THP-1 cells through inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/HIF-1α pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2294805418,"Sterol-regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) are key transcription factors regulating cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis. SREBP activity is tightly regulated to maintain lipid homeostasis, and is modulated upon extracellular stimuli such as growth factors. While the homeostatic SREBP regulation is well studied, stimuli-dependent regulatory mechanisms are still elusive. Here we demonstrate that SREBPs are regulated by a previously uncharacterized mechanism through transforming growth factor-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1), a signaling molecule of inflammation. We found that TAK1 binds to and inhibits mature forms of SREBPs. In an in vivo setting, hepatocyte-specific Tak1 deletion upregulates liver lipid deposition and lipogenic enzymes in the mouse model. Furthermore, hepatic Tak1 deficiency causes steatosis pathologies including elevated blood triglyceride and cholesterol levels, which are established risk factors for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and are indeed correlated with Tak1-deficiency-induced HCC development. Pharmacological inhibition of SREBPs alleviated the steatosis and reduced the expression level of the HCC marker gene in the Tak1-deficient liver. Thus, TAK1 regulation of SREBP critically contributes to the maintenance of liver homeostasis to prevent steatosis, which is a potentially important mechanism to prevent HCC development."
https://openalex.org/W2297125803,"Backgrounds The Women's Health Initiative Memory Study Magnetic Resonance Imaging (WHIMS-MRI) provides an opportunity to evaluate how menopausal hormone therapy (HT) affects the structure of older women’s brains. Our earlier work based on region of interest (ROI) analysis demonstrated potential structural changes underlying adverse effects of HT on cognition. However, the ROI-based analysis is limited in statistical power and precision, and cannot provide fine-grained mapping of whole-brain changes. Methods We aimed to identify local structural differences between HT and placebo groups from WHIMS-MRI in a whole-brain refined level, by using a novel method, named Optimally-Discriminative Voxel-Based Analysis (ODVBA). ODVBA is a recently proposed imaging pattern analysis approach for group comparisons utilizing a spatially adaptive analysis scheme to accurately locate areas of group differences, thereby providing superior sensitivity and specificity to detect the structural brain changes over conventional methods. Results Women assigned to HT treatments had significant Gray Matter (GM) losses compared to the placebo groups in the anterior cingulate and the adjacent medial frontal gyrus, and the orbitofrontal cortex, which persisted after multiple comparison corrections. There were no regions where HT was significantly associated with larger volumes compared to placebo, although a trend of marginal significance was found in the posterior cingulate cortical area. The CEE-Alone and CEE+MPA groups, although compared with different placebo controls, demonstrated similar effects according to the spatial patterns of structural changes. Conclusions HT had adverse effects on GM volumes and risk for cognitive impairment and dementia in older women. These findings advanced our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of HT effects."

We generated several novel murine ovarian cancer cell lines derived from the ovarian surface epithelia (OSE) of mice with conditional mutations in Kras, Pten or both. In addition, we also generated several tumor-derived new cell lines that reproduce the original tumor phenotype in vivo and mirror late stage metastatic disease. Our results demonstrate that de novo activation of oncogenic Kras does not trigger increased proliferation, cellular transformation or EMT, and prevents MUC1 upregulation. In contrast, Pten deletion accelerates cell proliferation, triggers cellular transformation in vitro and in vivo, and stimulates MUC1 expression. Ovarian tumor-derived cell lines MKP-Liver and MKP-Lung cells reproduce in vivo EMT and represent the first immune competent mouse model for distant hematogenous spread. Whole genome microarray expression analysis using tumor and OSE-derived cell lines reveal a 121 gene signature associated with EMT and metastasis. When applied to n=542 cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) ovarian cancer dataset, the gene signature identifies a patient subset with decreased survival (P=0.04). Using an extensive collection of novel murine cell lines we have identified distinct roles for Kras and Pten on MUC1 and EMT in vivo and in vitro. The data has implications for future design of combination therapies targeting Kras mutations, Pten deletions and MUC1 vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2300336107,"With advances in therapeutic instruments and techniques, three-dimensional dose delivery has been widely used in radiotherapy. The verification of dose distribution in a small field becomes critical because of the obvious dose gradient within the field. The study investigates the dose distributions of various field sizes by using NIPAM polymer gel dosimeter. The dosimeter consists of 5% gelatin, 5% monomers, 3% cross linkers, and 5 mM THPC. After irradiation, a 24 to 96 hour delay was applied, and the gel dosimeters were read by a cone beam optical computed tomography (optical CT) scanner. The dose distributions measured by the NIPAM gel dosimeter were compared to the outputs of the treatment planning system using gamma evaluation. For the criteria of 3%/3 mm, the pass rates for 5 × 5, 3 × 3, 2 × 2, 1 × 1, and 0.5 × 0.5 cm2 were as high as 91.7%, 90.7%, 88.2%, 74.8%, and 37.3%, respectively. For the criteria of 5%/5 mm, the gamma pass rates of the 5 × 5, 3 × 3, and 2 × 2 cm2 fields were over 99%. The NIPAM gel dosimeter provides high chemical stability. With cone-beam optical CT readouts, the NIPAM polymer gel dosimeter has potential for clinical dose verification of small-field irradiation."
https://openalex.org/W2299681726,"Research has established the health benefits of psychological factors, including the way individuals appraise outcomes. Although many studies confirm that appraising outcomes as controllable is adaptive for health, a paradoxical possibility is largely ignored: Perceived control may be detrimental under some conditions. Our premise was that appraising health as controllable but at the same time ascribing little value to it might signal a dysfunctional psychological mindset that fosters a mistaken sense of invincibility. During face-to-face interviews with a representative sample of older adults (age range = 72–99), we identified individuals with such a potentially maladaptive “invincible” mindset (high perceived control and low health value) and compared them to their counterparts on several outcomes. The findings were consistent with our hypotheses. The invincibles denied future risks, they lacked the activating emotion of fear, and they visited their physicians less often over a subsequent five-year period. Moreover, in contrast to their counterparts, the invincibles did not appear strategic in their approach to seeking care: Even poor health did not prompt them to seek the counsel of a physician. The recognition that psychological appraisals are modifiable highlights the promise of remedial methods to alter maladaptive mindsets, potentially improving quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2301848859,"Regulation of gene expression is essential to determining the functional complexity and morphological diversity seen among different cells. Transcriptional regulation is a crucial step in gene expression regulation because the genetic information is directly read from DNA by sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs). Although several mouse TF databases created from genome sequences and transcriptomes are available, a cell type-specific TF database from any normal cell populations is still lacking. We identify cell type-specific TF genes expressed in cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) and outer hair cells (OHCs) using hair cell-specific transcriptomes from adult mice. IHCs and OHCs are the two types of sensory receptor cells in the mammalian cochlea. We show that 1,563 and 1,616 TF genes are respectively expressed in IHCs and OHCs among 2,230 putative mouse TF genes. While 1,536 are commonly expressed in both populations, 73 genes are differentially expressed (with at least a twofold difference) in IHCs and 13 are differentially expressed in OHCs. Our datasets represent the first cell type-specific TF databases for two populations of sensory receptor cells and are key informational resources for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying the biological properties and phenotypical differences of these cells."
https://openalex.org/W2300120018,"Species are a fundamental unit of biodiversity, yet can be challenging to delimit objectively. This is particularly true of species complexes characterized by high levels of population genetic structure, hybridization between genetic groups, isolation by distance, and limited phenotypic variation. Previous work on the Cumberland Plateau Salamander, Plethodon kentucki, suggested that it might constitute a species complex despite occupying a relatively small geographic range. To examine this hypothesis, we sampled 135 individuals from 43 populations, and used four mitochondrial loci and five nuclear loci (5693 base pairs) to quantify phylogeographic structure and probe for cryptic species diversity. Rates of evolution for each locus were inferred using the multidistribute package, and time calibrated gene trees and species trees were inferred using BEAST 2 and *BEAST 2, respectively. Because the parameter space relevant for species delimitation is large and complex, and all methods make simplifying assumptions that may lead them to fail, we conducted an array of analyses. Our assumption was that strongly supported species would be congruent across methods. Putative species were first delimited using a Bayesian implementation of the GMYC model (bGMYC), Geneland, and Brownie. We then validated these species using the genealogical sorting index and BPP. We found substantial phylogeographic diversity using mtDNA, including four divergent clades and an inferred common ancestor at 14.9 myr (95% HPD: 10.8–19.7 myr). By contrast, this diversity was not corroborated by nuclear sequence data, which exhibited low levels of variation and weak phylogeographic structure. Species trees estimated a far younger root than did the mtDNA data, closer to 1.0 myr old. Mutually exclusive putative species were identified by the different approaches. Possible causes of data set discordance, and the problem of species delimitation in complexes with high levels of population structure and introgressive hybridization, are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2301711982,"Geranylated 4-phenylcoumarins, DMDP-1 & -2 isolated from Mesua elegans were investigated for anticancer potential against human prostate cancer cells. Treatment with DMDP-1 & -2 resulted in cell death in a time and dose dependent manner in an MTT assay on all cancer cell lines tested with the exception of lung adenocarcinoma cells. DMDP-1 showed highest cytotoxic efficacy in PC-3 cells while DMDP-2 was most potent in DU 145 cells. Flow cytometry indicated that both coumarins were successful to induce programmed cell death after 24 h treatment. Elucidation on the mode-of-action via protein arrays and western blotting demonstrated death induced without any significant expressions of caspases, Bcl-2 family proteins and cleaved PARP, thus suggesting the involvement of caspase-independent pathways. In identifying autophagy, analysis of GFP-LC3 showed increased punctate in PC-3 cells pre-treated with CQ and treated with DMDP-1. In these cells decreased expression of autophagosome protein, p62 and cathepsin B further confirmed autophagy. In contrary, the DU 145 cells pre-treated with CQ and treated with DMDP-2 has reduced GFP-LC3 punctate although the number of cells with obvious GFP-LC3 puncta was significantly increased in the inhibitor-treated cells. The increase level of p62 suggested leakage of cathepsin B into the cytosol to trigger potential downstream death mediators. This correlated with increased expression of cathepsin B and reduced expression after treatment with its inhibitor, CA074. Also auto-degradation of calpain-2 upon treatment with DMDP-1 &-2 and its inhibitor alone, calpeptin compared with the combination treatment, further confirmed involvement of calpain-2 in PC-3 and DU 145 cells. Treatment with DMDP-1 & -2 also showed up-regulation of total and phosphorylated p53 levels in a time dependent manner. Hence, DMDP-1 & -2 showed ability to activate multiple death pathways involving autophagy, lysosomal and endoplasmic reticulum death proteins which could potentially be manipulated to develop anti-cancer therapy in apoptosis resistant cells."
https://openalex.org/W2415525599,"Gender of the calf whose birth initiates lactation could influence whole lactation milk yield of the dam due to hormonal influences on mammary gland development, or through calf gender effects on gestation length. Fetal gender could influence late lactation yields because cows become pregnant at peak lactation. The effects of calf gender sequences in parities 1–3 were assessed by separately fitting animal models to datasets from New Zealand comprising 274 000 Holstein Friesian and 85 000 Jersey cows, decreasing to 12 000 and 4 000 cows by parity 3. The lactation initiated by the birth of a female rather than a male calf was associated with a 0.33–1.1% (p≤0.05) higher milk yield. Female calf gender had carryover effects associated with higher milk yield in second lactations for Holstein Friesians (0.24%; p = 0.01) and third lactations for Jerseys (1.1%; p = 0.01). Cows giving birth to bull calves have 2 day longer gestations, which reduces lactation length in seasonal calving herds. Adding a covariate for lactation length to the animal model eroded some of these calf gender effects, such that calving a female led to higher milk yield only for second lactation Holstein Friesians (1.6%; p = 0.002). The interval centering method generates lower estimates of whole lactation yield when Wood’s lactation curves are shifted to the right by 2 days for male calves and this explained the higher yield in female calves when differences in lactation length were considered. Correlations of estimated breeding values between models including or excluding calf gender sequence were 1.00 for bulls or cows. Calf gender primarily influences milk yield through increased gestation length of male calves, and bias associated with the interval centering method used to estimate whole lactation milk yields. Including information on calf gender is unlikely to have an effect on selection response in New Zealand dairy cattle."
https://openalex.org/W2300920230,"The ability of mammals to feel noxious stimuli lies in a heterogeneous group of primary somatosensory neurons termed nociceptors, which express specific membrane receptors, such as the Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) family. Here, we show that one of the most important nociceptive-like pathways is conserved in the freshwater coelenterate Hydra vulgaris, the most primitive organism possessing a nervous system. In particular, we found that H. vulgaris expresses TRPM3, a nociceptor calcium channel involved in the detection of noxious heat in mammals. Furthermore, we detected that both heat shock and TRPM3 specific agonist (i.e., pregnenolone sulfate) induce the modulation of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and the nitric oxide synthase (NOS), two genes activated by TRP-mediated heat painful stimuli in mammals. As expected, these effects are inhibited by a TRPM3 antagonist (i.e., mefenamic acid). Interestingly, the TRPM3 agonist and heat shock also induce the expression of nuclear transcription erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), known markers of oxidative stress; noteworthy gene expression was also inhibited by the TRPM3 antagonist. As a whole, our results demonstrate the presence of conserved molecular oxidative/nociceptive-like pathways at the primordial level of the animal kingdom."
https://openalex.org/W2297898110,"Background Fine tuning of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is essential for the proper development and function of the liver. Aberrant activation of this pathway is observed in 20%-40% of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Notum encodes a secreted Wnt deacylase that inhibits Wnt activity and thereby restricts the zone of activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. An important role of NOTUM has been described in development in drosophila, planaria and zebrafish, but its role in the mammalian liver is unknown. Notum is required for spatial control of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in several animal models and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway contributes to liver patterning involved in metabolic zonation. Therefore, Notum may be involved in the liver patterning induced by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling during the adult stage. Methodology/principal findings We generated a conditional Notum knockout mouse mutant to study the effect of the deletion of Notum in the liver. We show that Notum is a direct target of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the liver. Liver-specific deletion of Notum did not modify liver zonation, but Notum deletion had a long-term effect on mouse physiology. In particular, male mutant mice developed metabolic disorders. Conclusion We show that Notum is not a key actor of Wnt/β-catenin-dependent liver patterning of adult mice, but has role in liver glucose homeostasis. Male mice deficient in Notum specifically in the liver develop metabolic dysfunctions implicating Notum in the development of Type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2300329325,"Background The GOLD multidimensional classification of COPD severity combines the exacerbation risk with the symptom experience, for which 3 different questionnaires are permitted. This study investigated differences in physical activity (PA) in the different GOLD quadrants and patient’s distribution in relation to the questionnaire used. Methods 136 COPD patients (58±21% FEV1 predicted, 34F/102M) completed COPD assessment test (CAT), clinical COPD questionnaire (CCQ) and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) questionnaire. Exacerbation history, spirometry and 6MWD were collected. PA was objectively measured for 2 periods of 1 week, 6 months apart, in 5 European centres; to minimise seasonal and clinical variation the average of these two periods was used for analysis. Results GOLD quadrants C+D had reduced PA compared with A+B (3824 [2976] vs. 5508 [4671] steps.d-1, p<0.0001). The choice of questionnaire yielded different patient distributions (agreement mMRC-CAT κ = 0.57; CCQ-mMRC κ = 0.71; CCQ-CAT κ = 0.72) with different clinical characteristics. PA was notably lower in patients with an mMRC score ≥2 (3430 [2537] vs. 5443 [3776] steps.d-1, p <0.001) in both the low and high risk quadrants. Conclusions Using different questionnaires changes the patient distribution and results in different clinical characteristics. Therefore, standardization of the questionnaire used for classification is critical to allow comparison of different studies using this as an entry criterion.

The anti-inflammatory activities of the absorbed components were evaluated by measuring nitric oxide (NO) production and proinflammatory genes expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine RAW 264.7 macrophages. As a result, 54 components in Sarcandra glabra were detected in dosed rat plasma, and 36 of them were positively identified. Moreover, 23 metabolites were characterized and their originations were traced. Furthermore, 20 of the 24 studied components showed anti-inflammatory activities.

https://openalex.org/W2298339347,"Sodium selenite is a trace element essential for many physiological functions in the body. It is involved in various biological processes; it acts as a cofactor for antioxidant enzymes that protect against free radicals and is reported to limit metal-mediated oxidative DNA damage. In the present study, we investigated the effect of sodium selenite on neomycin ototoxicity in wild-type and transgenic zebrafish (Brn3C: EGFP). Five or six days post-fertilization, zebrafish larvae were co-exposed to 125 μM neomycin and various concentrations (10 μM, 100 μM, 250 μM, and 500 μM) of sodium selenite for 1 h. Hair cells within neuromasts of the supraorbital (SO1 and SO2), otic (O1), and occipital (OC1) lateral lines were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (n = 10 fish per treatment). Hair cell survival was estimated as the ratio of the hair cell numbers in each group compared to those of the control group that were not exposed to neomycin. Apoptosis and hair cell damage of neuromasts were evaluated using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and 2-[4-(dimethylamino) styryl]-N-ethylpyridinium iodide (DASPEI) assay, respectively. Ultrastructural changes were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Neuromast hair cells were preserved in zebrafish exposed to 125 μM neomycin and 500 μM sodium selenite for 1 h. Sodium selenite protected against neomycin-induced hair cell loss of neuromasts, reduced apoptosis, and prevented zebrafish ultrastructural changes. We propose that sodium selenite protects against neomycin-induced hair cell damage by inhibiting apoptosis, decreasing the disarray of stereocilia, and preventing ultrastructural changes in the neuromast hair cells of the zebrafish."
https://openalex.org/W2295230517,"Loss of von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein function is a key driver of VHL diseases, including sporadic and inherited clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Modulation of the proteostasis of VHL, especially missense point-mutated VHL, is a promising approach to augmenting VHL levels and function. VHL proteostasis is regulated by multiple mechanisms including folding, chaperone binding, complex formation and phosphorylation. Nevertheless, many details underlying the regulations of VHL proteostasis are unknown. VHL is expressed as two variants, VHL30 and VHL19. Furthermore, the long-form variant of VHL was often detected as multiple bands by western blotting. However, how these multiple species of VHL are generated and whether the process regulates VHL proteostasis and function are unknown. We hypothesized that the two major species are generated by VHL protein cleavage, and the cleavage regulates VHL proteostasis and subsequent function. We characterized VHL species using genetical and pharmacological approaches and showed that VHL was first cleaved at the N-terminus by chymotrypsin C before being directed for proteasomal degradation. Casein kinase 2-mediated phosphorylation at VHL N-terminus was required for the cleavage. Furthermore, inhibition of cleavage stabilized VHL protein and thereby promoted HIF downregulation. Our study reveals a novel mechanism regulating VHL proteostasis and function, which is significant for identifying new drug targets and developing new therapeutic approaches targeting VHL deficiency in VHL diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2462407230,"TcTLE is a nonamer peptide from Trypanosoma cruzi KMP-11 protein that is conserved among different parasite strains and that is presented by different HLA-A molecules from the A2 supertype. Because peptides presented by several major histocompatibility complex (MHC) supertypes are potential targets for immunotherapy, the aim of this study was to determine whether MHC molecules other than the A2 supertype present the TcTLE peptide.From 36 HLA-A2-negative chagasic patients, the HLA-A genotypes of twenty-eight patients with CD8+ T cells that recognized the TcTLE peptide using tetramer (twenty) or functional (eight) assays, were determined. SSP-PCR was used to identify the A locus and the allelic variants. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the frequency of TcTLE-specific CD8+ T cells, and their functional activity (IFN-γ, TNFα, IL-2, perforin, granzyme and CD107a/b production) was induced by exposure to the TcTLE peptide. All patients tested had TcTLE-specific CD8+ T cells with frequencies ranging from 0.07-0.37%. Interestingly, seven of the twenty-eight patients had HLA-A homozygous alleles: A*24 (5 patients), A*23 (1 patient) and A*01 (1 patient), which belong to the A24 and A1 supertypes. In the remaining 21 patients with HLA-A heterozygous alleles, the most prominent alleles were A24 and A68. The most common allele sub-type was A*2402 (sixteen patients), which belongs to the A24 supertype, followed by A*6802 (six patients) from the A2 supertype. Additionally, the A*3002/A*3201 alleles from the A1 supertype were detected in one patient. All patients presented CD8+ T cells producing at least one cytokine after TcTLE peptide stimulation.These results show that TcTLE is a promiscuous peptide that is presented by the A24 and A1 supertypes, in addition to the A2 supertype, suggesting its potential as a target for immunotherapy."

Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), a pattern recognition receptor, is an essential component in host innate defense system against S. aureus infection. However, little is known about the innate immune response, specifically TLR2 activation, against MRSA infection. Here, we evaluate the protective effect and the mechanism of MRSA murine pneumonia after pretreatment with Pam3CSK4, a TLR2 agonist. We found that the MRSA-pneumonia mouse model, pretreated with Pam3CSK4, had reduced bacteria and mortality in comparison to control mice. As well, lower protein and mRNA levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 were observed in lungs and bronchus of the Pam3CSK4 pretreatment group. Conversely, expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, but not TGF-β, increased in Pam3CSK4-pretreated mice. Our additional studies showed that CXCL-2 and CXCL1, which are necessary for neutrophil recruitment, were less evident in the Pam3CSK4-pretreated group compared to control group, whereas the expression of Fcγ receptors (FcγⅠ/Ⅲ) and complement receptors (CR1/3) increased in murine lungs. Furthermore, we found that increased survival and improved bacterial clearance were not a result of higher levels of neutrophil infiltration, but rather a result of enhanced phagocytosis and bactericidal activity of neutrophils in vitro and in vivo as well as increased robust oxidative activity and release of lactoferrin. Our cumulative findings suggest that Pam3CSK4 could be a novel immunotherapeutic candidate against MRSA pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W2299256329,"The use of mouse oocytes as a model for studying female meiosis is very important in reproductive medicine. Gene knockdown by specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) is usually the first step in the study of the function of a target gene in mouse oocytes during in vitro maturation. Traditionally, the only way to introduce siRNA into mouse oocytes is through microinjection, which is certainly less efficient and strenuous than siRNA transfection in somatic cells. Recently, in research using somatic cells, peptide nanoparticle-mediated siRNA transfection has been gaining popularity over liposome nanoparticle-mediated methods because of its high efficiency, low toxicity, good stability, and strong serum compatibility. However, no researchers have yet tried transfecting siRNA into mouse oocytes because of the existence of the protective zona pellucida surrounding the oocyte membrane (vitelline membrane). We therefore tested whether peptide nanoparticles can introduce siRNA into mouse oocytes. In the present study, we showed for the first time that our optimized program can efficiently knock down a target gene with high specificity. Furthermore, we achieved the expected meiotic phenotypes after we knocked down a test unknown target gene TRIM75. We propose that peptide nanoparticles may be superior for preliminary functional studies of unknown genes in mouse oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2296873320,"KIT mutations are frequent in acral, mucosal and chronic sun-damage (CSD) melanoma, but little is known about the mechanisms driving the transformation of KIT-mutated melanocytes into melanoma cells. We showed that exposition of melanocytes harboring the L576PKIT mutation to a hypoxic environment induced their transformation into malignant cells. Transformed L576PKIT melanocytes showed downregulation of MITF expression characteristic of melanoma initiating cells (MICs). In agreement, these cells were able to form spheres in neural crest cell medium and low-adherence conditions, also a characteristic of MICs. Downregulation of MITF by RNA interference induced transformation of KIT-mutated melanocytes in normoxia and acquisition of a MIC phenotype by these cells. Hence, low level of MITF cooperates with oncogenic KIT to transform melanocytes. Activation of the cAMP pathway in transformed L576PKIT melanocytes stimulated MITF expression, and reduced cellular proliferation and sphere formation. These findings highlight the essential role of MITF in revealing the oncogenic activity of KIT in melanocytes and suggest that the cAMP pathway is a therapeutic target in KIT-mutated melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2300687718,"Complete panmixia across the entire range of a species is a relatively rare phenomenon; however, this pattern may be found in species that have limited philopatry and frequent dispersal. American white pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhyncos) provide a unique opportunity to examine the role of long-distance dispersal in facilitating gene flow in a species recently reported as panmictic across its broad breeding range. This species is also undergoing a range expansion, with new colonies arising hundreds of kilometers outside previous range boundaries. In this study, we use a multiple stable isotope (δ2H, δ13C, δ15N) approach to examine feather isotopic structuring at 19 pelican colonies across North America, with the goal of establishing an isotopic basemap that could be used for assigning individuals at newly established breeding sites to source colonies. Within-colony isotopic variation was extremely high, exceeding 100‰ in δ2H within some colonies (with relatively high variation also observed for δ13C and δ15N). The high degree of within-site variation greatly limited the utility of assignment-based approaches (42% cross-validation success rate; range: 0–90% success). Furthermore, clustering algorithms identified four likely isotopic clusters; however, those clusters were generally unrelated to geographic location. Taken together, the high degree of within-site isotopic variation and lack of geographically-defined isotopic clusters preclude the establishment of an isotopic basemap for American white pelicans, but may indicate that a high incidence of long-distance dispersal is facilitating gene flow, leading to genetic panmixia."

Infection with this highly pathogenic strain can cause streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (STSLS), characterized by a Th-1 inflammatory cytokine storm, and a high mortality rate. Monocyte derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) are known to stimulate Th-1 cell differentiation, but the role of MoDCs in STSLS remains to be elucidated.Porcine CD14-positive monocytes, purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), were used to generate MoDCs using granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 (IL-4). Highly pure MoDCs were generated, as proved by their morphology, phenotype analysis, phagocytic ability, and induction of T cells proliferation. The MoDCs were further stimulated by the virulent S. suis serotype 2 (SS2) SC19 strain which triggered a strong release of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and IL-12. Furthermore, the stimulated MoDCs induced CD4+ T cell differentiation towards Th-1 cells in vitro.The results of this study indicated that the porcine MoDCs stimulated by SS2 could release high levels of Th-1 inflammatory cytokines and induce CD4+ T cell differentiation towards Th-1 cells. Hence, it is likely that porcine MoDCs play an important role in the STSLS caused by SS2."

Buffered formaldehyde in pathology laboratories for tissue fixation is known to cause chemical modifications of biomolecules which affect molecular testing. A novel non-crosslinking tissue preservation technology, PAXgene Tissue (PAXgene), was developed to preserve the integrity of nucleic acids in a comparable way to cryopreservation and also to preserve morphological features comparable to those of formalin fixed samples.Because of the excellent preservation of biomolecules by PAXgene we investigated its pathogen inactivation ability and biosafety in comparison to formalin by in-vitro testing of bacteria, human relevant fungi and human cytomegalovirus (CMV). Guidelines for testing disinfectants served as reference for inactivation assays. Furthermore, we tested the properties of PAXgene for detection of pathogens by PCR based assays.All microorganisms tested were similarly inactivated by PAXgene and formalin except Clostridium sporogenes, which remained viable in seven out of ten assays after PAXgene treatment and in three out of ten assays after formalin fixation. The findings suggest that similar biosafety measures can be applied for PAXgene and formalin fixed samples. Detection of pathogens in PCR-based diagnostics using two CMV assays resulted in a reduction of four to ten quantification cycles of PAXgene treated samples which is a remarkable increase of sensitivity.PAXgene fixation might be superior to formalin fixation when molecular diagnostics and highly sensitive detection of pathogens is required in parallel to morphology assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2409636276,"Although most Salmonella serovars are able to infect a range of animal hosts, some have acquired the ability to cause systemic infections of specific hosts. For example, Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis is primarily associated with systemic infection in swine. Adherence to host epithelial cells is considered a prerequisite for initial infection, and fimbrial appendages on the outer membrane of the bacteria are implicated in this process. Although type 1 fimbriae encoded by the fim gene cluster are commonly found in Salmonella serovars, it is not known whether S. Choleraesuis produces this fimbrial type and if and how fimbriae are involved in pathogenesis. In the present study, we demonstrated that only four out of 120 S. Choleraesuis isolates from pigs with salmonellosis produced type 1 fimbriae as assayed by the yeast agglutination test and electron microscopy. One of the 116 non-type 1 fimbria-producing isolates was transformed with plasmids carrying different fim genes from S. Typhimurium LB5010, a type 1 fimbria-producing strain. Our results indicate that non-type 1 fimbria-producing S. Choleraesuis required only an intact fimH to regain the ability to produce fimbrial appendages. Sequence comparison revealed six amino acid variations between the FimH of the non-type 1 fimbria-producing S. Choleraesuis isolates and those of the type 1 fimbria-producing S. Choleraesuis isolates. S. Choleraesuis that produced type 1 fimbriae contained FimH with an amino acid sequence identical to that of S. Typhimurium LB5010. Site-directed mutagenesis leading to the replacement of the non-conserved residues revealed that a change from glycine to valine at position of 63 (G63V) resulted in a non-type 1 fimbria-producing S. Choleraesuis being able to express type 1 fimbriae on its outer membrane. It is possible that this particular amino acid change prevents this polypeptide from proper interaction with other Fim subunits required for assembly of an intact type 1 fimbrial shaft in S. Choleraesuis; however, it remains to be determined if and how the absence of type 1 fimbriae production is related to the systemic infection of the swine host by S. Choleraesuis."
https://openalex.org/W2302227151,"Mice are used for modelling the biology of many human diseases, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Mouse models recapitulate many aspects of human disease and are invaluable tools for studying the biology, treatment and prevention of CRC. Unlike humans, many mouse models develop lesions primarily in the small intestine, which necessitates removal and examination of this organ in order to evaluate treatment efficacy. Commonly, the small intestine is visually examined for gross lesions and then selectively embedded in paraffin blocks for further microscopic analysis. Unfortunately, this method suffers from inherent bias toward counting large lesions and simultaneously missing smaller lesions. Even more, this method leaves no permanent record of diagnosed and measured lesions. We evaluated inter-observer variability in a mouse model of CRC using visual examination, and directly compared the visual, gross examination with a histologic analytic method using digital slides of hematoxylin and eosin stained tissue sections.Using visual examination, there was a high degree of inter-observer variability. As this method does not provide a permanent record of measurements, there is no capability to arbitrate between differing observations. In contrast, histologic analysis allowed for the creation of a permanent record of lesion measurements taken. When compared directly, histologic analysis of annotated digital images has significantly improved accuracy. Using this method we were able to distinguish mutant mice from wild type littermates even at a very young age. With gross visual examination, this distinction was not possible.Histologic analysis of digital images of murine intestinal tissue provides a vital improvement over the commonly used visual, gross examination method. Unlike visual gross examination, histologic analysis is not biased by the size of intestinal adenoma, misdiagnosis of another lesion type, or presence of a Peyer's patch. It also provides accountability in the form of a permanent record of lesions counted. Histologic analysis using digital slides represents a critical improvement over the current, widely used method of visual gross examination and should be considered for future studies using mouse models of CRC."
