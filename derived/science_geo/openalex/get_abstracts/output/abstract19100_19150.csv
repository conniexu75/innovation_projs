https://openalex.org/W2068568687,"Studies of diseases caused by mitochondrial DNA mutations suggest that a variety of degenerative processes may be associated with defects in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Application of this hypothesis has provided new insights into such diverse clinical problems as ischemic heart disease, late-onset diabetes, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and aging."
https://openalex.org/W1972727772,"Mice homozygous for null alleles of the putative signaling molecule Wnt-1 have a reproducible phenotype: loss of the midbrain and adjacent cerebellar component of the metencephalon. By examining embryonic expression of the mouse engrailed (En) genes, from 8.0 to 9.5 days postcoitum, we demonstrate that Wnt-1 primarily regulates midbrain development. The midbrain itself is required for normal development of the metencephalon. Thus, the observed neonatal phenotype is explained by a series of early events, within 48 hr of neural plate induction, that leads to a complete loss of En domains in the anterior central nervous system. Wnt-1 and a related gene, Wnt-3a, are coexpressed from early somite stages in dorsal aspects of the myelencephalon and spinal cord. We suggest that functional redundancy between these two genes accounts for the lack of a caudal central nervous system phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1501522779,"Although it is a well-known fact that hemodynamic load is a major determinant of cardiac muscle mass and its phenotype, little is known as to how mechanical load is converted into intracellular signals of gene regulation. To address this question, we characterized the stretch-induced adaptation of cultured neonatal cardiocytes grown on a stretchable substrate in a serum-free medium. Static stretch (20%) of the cells was applied without cell injury. Stretch caused hypertrophy in myocytes and hyperplasia in non-myocytes. Stretch caused an induction of immediate-early genes such as c-fos, c-jun, c-myc, JE, and Egr-1, but not Hsp70. Immunostaining showed that the stretch-induced Fos protein localized in the nucleus of both myocytes and non-myocytes. Nuclear extracts from stretched myocytes contained DNA binding activity to the AP-1 and Egr-1 consensus sequences. In myocytes, the induction of immediate-early genes was followed by expression of fetal genes such as skeletal alpha-actin, atrial natriuretic factor, and beta-myosin heavy chain. DNA transfection experiments showed that the stretch-response element of the c-fos gene promoter is present within 356 base pairs of the 5'-flanking region, whereas that of the atrial natriuretic factor and the beta-myosin heavy chain genes is probably located outside of 3412 and 628 base pairs of the 5'-flanking region, respectively. These results demonstrate that the phenotype of stretched cardiocytes in this in vitro model closely mimics that of hemodynamic load-induced hypertrophy in vivo. This model seems to be a suitable system with which to dissect the molecular mechanisms of load-induced hypertrophy of cardiac muscle."

https://openalex.org/W1481480776,"Using a combination of conventional and affinity chromatographic techniques, we have purified a uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine:polypeptide beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (O-GlcNAc transferase) over 30,000-fold from rat liver cytosol. The transferase is soluble and very large, migrating with an apparent molecular weight of 340,000 on molecular sieve chromatography. Analysis of the purified enzyme on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals two protein species migrating at 110 (alpha subunit) and 78 (beta subunit) kDa in approximately a two-to-one ratio. Thus, the enzyme likely exists as a heterotrimer complex with two subunits of 110 kDa and one of 78 kDa (alpha 2 beta). The alpha subunit appears to contain the enzyme's active site since it is selectively radiolabeled by a specific photoaffinity probe (4-[beta-32P]thiouridine diphosphate). Photoinactivation and photolabeling of the enzyme are dependent on time and long wavelength ultraviolet light. Photolabeling of the alpha subunit is specifically blocked by UDP. The enzyme has an extremely high affinity for UDP-GlcNAc (Km = 545 nM). This unusually high affinity for the sugar nucleotide donor probably provides the enzyme an advantage over the nucleotide transporters in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus which compete for available cytoplasmic UDP-GlcNAc. The multimeric state and large size of the O-GlcNAc transferase imply that its activity may be highly regulated within the cell."

https://openalex.org/W2026628085,"The Escherichia coli Rep helicase unwinds duplex DNA during replication. The functional helicase appears to be a dimer that forms only on binding DNA. Both protomers of the dimer can bind either single-stranded or duplex DNA. Because binding and hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are essential for helicase function, the energetics of DNA binding and DNA-induced Rep dimerization were studied quantitatively in the presence of the nucleotide cofactors adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMPP(NH)P. Large allosteric effects of nucleotide cofactors on DNA binding to Rep were observed. Binding of ADP favored Rep dimers in which both protomers bound single-stranded DNA, whereas binding of AMPP(NH)P favored simultaneous binding of both single-stranded and duplex DNA to the Rep dimer. A rolling model for the active unwinding of duplex DNA by the dimeric Rep helicase is proposed that explains vectorial unwinding and predicts that helicase translocation along DNA is coupled to ATP binding, whereas ATP hydrolysis drives unwinding of multiple DNA base pairs for each catalytic event."
https://openalex.org/W1522422264,"The UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase is a soluble protein of the endoplasmic reticulum that catalyzes the glucosylation of protein-linked, glucose-free, high mannose-type oligosaccharides. In vivo, the newly glucosylated compounds are immediately deglucosylated, presumably by glucosidase II. The glucosyltransferase has been purified to apparent homogeneity from rat liver. The enzyme appears to have a molecular weight of 150,000 and 270,000 under denaturing and native conditions, respectively. The pure enzyme shows an almost absolute requirement for Ca2+ ions and for UDP-Glc as sugar donor. The same as crude preparations, the pure enzyme synthesized Glc1 Man7-9GlcNAc2-protein from Man7-9GlcNAc2-protein. Denatured glycoproteins are glucosylated much more efficiently than native ones by the apparently homogeneous glucosyltransferase. Availability of the pure enzyme will allow testing the possible involvement of transient glucosylation of glycoproteins in the folding of glycoproteins and/or in the mechanism by which cells dispose of malfolded glycoproteins in the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W2104274727,"The protein B-50 (F1, GAP-43) is a presynaptic-specific substrate of protein kinase C, functionally related to neurotransmitter release. An increase in phosphorylation of this protein has been proposed as a molecular mechanism underlying long-term potentiation (LTP). B-50 phosphorylation measured by quantitative immunoprecipitation in rat hippocampal slices incubated in the presence of radiolabeled inorganic phosphate was increased for at least 1 hr after the induction of LTP in the CA1 region. No significant changes in B-50 phosphorylation were observed in untetanized slices stimulated at low frequency. The direct demonstration of an increased phosphorylation of the protein B-50 during LTP is consistent with the hypothesis that presynaptic mechanisms contribute to maintenance of LTP."
https://openalex.org/W1489057324,"The coated vesicle (H+)-ATPase is composed of two domains, a peripheral V1 domain containing the 73 (A subunit)-, 58 (B subunit)-, 40-, 34-, and 33-kDa subunits and an integral V0 domain containing the 100-, 38-, 19-, and 17 (c subunit)-kDa subunits (Adachi, I., Puopolo, K., Marquez-Sterling, N., Arai, H., and Forgac, M. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 967-973). In the present manuscript we characterize the V0 domain with respect to its structural and activity properties. Glycerol density gradient separation of solubilized coated vesicle membrane proteins reveals the presence of an excess of V0 domains which migrate with a molecular weight of 250,000 and contain the V0 polypeptides in the same stoichiometry as in the intact V1V0 complex. Like the c subunit in V1V0, the c subunit of the free V0 domain is labeled by [14C]N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) and is extracted by chloroform:methanol. In addition, a monoclonal antibody specific for the 100-kDa subunit of the intact (H+)-ATPase recognizes the 100-kDa subunit of V0. Tryptic cleavage of the V0 complex gives the same pattern of fragments for the 100- and 38-kDa subunits as in the intact complex, but with an increase in sensitivity, suggesting greater exposure of these subunits in free V0. Proton conduction was measured in reconstituted vesicles containing the V0 domain and in native vesicles stripped of V1. No DCCD-inhibitable proton conduction was observed in either preparation, suggesting that unlike the corresponding F0 domain of F1F0, the free V0 domain is not an open proton channel."
https://openalex.org/W1973761362,"The excisive recombination reaction of bacteriophage lambda involves a specific and efficient juxtaposition of two distant higher order protein-DNA complexes on the chromosome of Escherichia coli. These complexes, which mediate synapsis and strand exchange, consist of two DNA sequences, attL and attR, the bivalent DNA binding protein Int, and the sequence-specific DNA bending proteins, IHF, Xis, and Fis. The protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions within, and between, these complexes were studied by various biochemical techniques and the patterns of synergism among pairs of mutants with marginally impaired recombination function were analyzed. The DNA bending proteins facilitated long-range tethering of high- and low-affinity DNA sites by the bivalent Int protein, and a specific map is proposed for the resulting Int bridges. These structural motifs provide a basis for postulating the mechanisms of site-specific recombination and may also be relevant to other pathways in which two distant chromosomal sites become associated."
https://openalex.org/W1495372230,"Signaling through serotonin 5-HT1A receptors involves multiple pathways. We have investigated the functional coupling of the human 5-HT1A receptor to different G proteins using an in vitro reconstitution system based on the expression of recombinant receptor (r5-HT1A) and G alpha-subunits (rG alpha) in Escherichia coli. The r5-HT1A receptor was expressed by insertion in a vector allowing its active expression in E. coli inner membranes. Binding of the selective agonist [3H] +/- 8-hydroxy-(2-N-dipropylamine)tetralin ([3H]8-OH-DPAT) to intact bacteria or E. coli membranes was saturable with a KD of approximately 8 nM and an average of 120 sites/bacterium. Binding properties of several serotoninergic ligands to r5-HT1A receptors were comparable with those measured in mammalian cells. Incubation of rG alpha.beta gamma with E. coli membranes resulted in high affinity agonist [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding (KD = 0.7 nM) and titration with a panel of rG alpha subtypes showed the order of potency: rGi alpha-3 greater than rGi alpha-2 greater than rGi alpha-1 much greater than rGo alpha, while rGs alpha appeared incapable of interacting with 5-HT1A receptors. Moreover, agonist-mediated enhancement of [35S]guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) binding to rGi alpha confirmed the achievement of the functional interaction between receptor and G proteins. Our findings are in agreement with the in vivo ability of 5-HT1A receptors to activate Gi alpha related to adenylyl cyclase inhibition or K+ channel activation, but do not support previously reported adenylyl cyclase stimulation through interaction with Gs alpha."
https://openalex.org/W2167421006,"The Neurospora CYT-18 protein, a tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase, which functions in splicing group I introns in mitochondria, promotes splicing of mutants of the distantly related bacteriophage T4 td intron. In an in vivo assay, wild-type CYT-18 protein expressed in E. coli suppressed mutations in the td intron's catalytic core. CYT-18-suppressible mutations were also suppressed by high Mg2+ or spermidine in vitro, suggesting they affect intron structure. Both the N- and C-terminal domains of CYT-18 are required for efficient splicing, but CYT-18 with a large C-terminal truncation retains some activity. Our results indicate that CYT-18 interacts with conserved structural features of group I introns, and they provide direct evidence that a protein promotes splicing by stabilizing the catalytically active structure of the intron RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2113081221,"Androgen-binding protein (ABP) and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) are extracellular steroid-binding proteins that are homologous to the COOH-terminal domain of vitamin K-dependent protein S, a protein important in blood clotting. We find that the sequences of ABP, SHBG, and protein S are also similar to two basement membrane proteins, laminin and merosin, and to an integral membrane protein, Drosophila crumbs protein. These latter three proteins have important roles in regulating differentiation and development. The sequence similarity corresponds to the G domain of laminin A chain, which binds heparin and type IV collagen. Analysis of a multiple alignment of these proteins reveals one well-conserved segment corresponding to the part of SHBG that binds to its membrane receptor and another corresponding to the part of protein S that binds to C4b-binding protein. The similarities suggest that ABP, SHBG, and protein S may also have functions related to that of laminin and merosin."
https://openalex.org/W1562334062,"A soluble form of the b subunit of the F0 sector of the F1F0-ATPase of Escherichia coli has been produced, purified, and characterized. In this form of the protein, designated bsol, residues 25-146 (the carboxyl terminus) of b have been fused to an amino-terminal octapeptide extension derived from the vector pUC8. The inferred subunit molecular weight of bsol is 15,459. bsol protein was expressed in E. coli as a soluble cytoplasmic protein and was readily purified to homogeneity by conventional methods. The molecular weight of bsol, determined by sedimentation equilibrium, was 31,200, indicating that the protein is dimeric. Chemical cross-linking studies supported this conclusion. However, bsol sedimented with a coefficient of just 1.8 S and behaved on size exclusion chromatography with an apparent molecular weight of 80,000-85,000. These results indicate that the protein exists in solution as a highly elongated dimer. The circular dichroism spectrum indicated that bsol is highly alpha-helical. Binding of bsol to F1-ATPase was directly demonstrated by size exclusion chromatography. bsol also inhibited the binding of F1-ATPase to F1-depleted membrane vesicles, as measured by reconstitution of energy-dependent quinacrine fluorescence quenching. This result implies that bsol and F0 compete for binding to the same site on F1. The apparently normal interaction of bsol with F1-ATPase strongly suggests that the recombinant protein assumes the correct structure. No substantial effects of bsol on the ATPase activity of purified F1 were observed."
https://openalex.org/W1544172591,"A calcyclin-associated protein with an apparent molecular weight of 50,000 (CAP-50) was purified from rabbit lung. The procedure included ammonium sulfate precipitation, anion and cation ion-exchange, and calcyclin affinity chromatographies. Interestingly, partial amino acid sequences of lysyl-endpeptidase-digested fragments indicated that CAP-50 was a member of the Ca2+/phospholipid-binding proteins, the annexin family. The sequence of a proteolytic peptide with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease on NH2-terminal region is not homologous with any other annexin family proteins. Phospholipid binding studies showed that CAP-50 bound to phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidic acid-containing vesicles, in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. In the presence of Ca2+/calcyclin, CAP-50 formed a complex with calcyclin and bound to the PS-containing vesicles. The apparent Kd value of calcyclin for CAP-50 was calculated to be 1.61 x 10(-6) M. Zero-length cross-linking studies indicated that 1 mol of CAP-50 bound to an equimolar unit of calcyclin. CAP-50 inhibited the phospholipase A2 activity, dose-dependently (IC50 = 0.2 microM), however, calcyclin did not alter the inhibitory effect. With the 125I-calcyclin gel overlay method, calcyclin bound tightly to CAP-50 in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These results suggest that rabbit lung CAP-50 is a newly identified member of the annexin family. Ca2+/calcyclin apparently regulates the function of CAP-50 on cytosolic face of the plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1527438810,"When hepatocytes were loaded with fura-2 by incubation with the acetoxymethyl ester (fura-2/AM), addition of Mn2+ resulted in a rapid quench of a fraction of cellular fura-2 fluorescence. Addition of vasopressin caused a second, rapid quench of cellular fura-2, whereas the addition of thapsigargin had no effect. When hepatocytes were loaded by microinjection of fura-2 acid, addition of Mn2+ caused a slower, sustained rate of quench, and both vasopressin and thapsigargin increased this rate of quench. When Mn2+ was removed from the medium of fura-2/AM-loaded cells after preincubation with Mn2+, vasopressin still caused quench of cellular fura-2. In contrast, neither vasopressin nor thapsigargin increased fura-2 quench when Mn2+ was removed from fura-2-injected cells. When fura-2/AM-loaded cells were permeabilized with saponin, only a fraction of the cell-associated fura-2 was quenched by addition of Mn2+. A second fraction was then quenched by addition of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. These results indicate that in hepatocytes loaded with the acetoxymethyl ester of fura-2, the increased quench of cellular fura-2 seen with phospholipase C-linked agonists is not due to effects of the agonist on Mn2+ entry across the plasma membrane, but rather is due to agonist activation of Mn2+ penetration into an intracellular organelle, presumably through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-regulated channels. Thus, it appears that compartmentalization of fura-2 accounts for previously reported anomalies in Ca2+ signaling in hepatocytes, such as the apparent failure of Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibition to increase divalent cation entry, as well as the apparent ability of phospholipase C-linked agonists to stimulate efflux of Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1951540415,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a potent stimulator of IL-8 production by fibroblasts and monocytes. In the present study, we asked how much of endotoxin (LPS)-induced IL-8 production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells was due to IL-1 induced by LPS. Cells were stimulated with either IL-1 beta, LPS, or Borrelia burgdorferi, and total IL-8 was determined by a specific radioimmunoassay. The addition of saturating concentrations of IL-1 receptor antagonist protein (IRAP) reduced the IL-1 beta-, LPS-, and B. burgdorferi-induced IL-8 synthesis by 85, 50, and 40%, respectively. Increasing the concentration of LPS did not affect the reduction in IL-8 synthesis observed in the presence of IRAP. Significant inhibition of the IL-1 beta-induced IL-8 synthesis was observed when IRAP was added 60 or 90 min after IL-1 beta; similarly, IL-8 synthesis after LPS was also reduced by delayed addition of IRAP. These data suggest that the ameliorative effects of IL-1 receptor blockade in models of inflammation and infection may be due, in part, to suppression of IL-1-induced IL-8."
https://openalex.org/W1567435363,"The enzyme N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (NT, EC 2.4.1.101) is a resident type II transmembrane protein of the Golgi apparatus. To delineate the portion of its primary sequence that is responsible for the Golgi retention of this protein, we constructed chimeras containing different N-terminal portions of NT joined to a reporter sequence, the ectodomain of a type II surface membrane protein. These chimeric proteins were found to be retained in the Golgi apparatus as assessed by cell surface biotinylation and immunofluorescence. We found that the transmembrane domain of NT is sufficient to confer Golgi retention of the fusion proteins and propose that it contains the Golgi retention signal of the parent molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2101156215,"The sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum slow-twitch or cardiac Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2) is expressed as two forms (SERCA2a and SERCA2b) which vary at their extreme carboxyl termini. SERCA2a and SERCA2b are derived from alternatively spliced primary transcripts of the same gene. These two alternative carboxyl termini are highly conserved in mammals (Eggermont, J. A., Wuytack, F., De Jaegere, S., Nelles, L., and Casteels, R. (1989) Biochem. J. 260, 757-761; Lytton, J., and MacLennan, D. H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 15024-15031) and birds (Campbell, A. M., Kessler, P. D., Sagara, Y., Inesi, G., and Fambrough, D. M. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 16050-16055). The topology of SERCA2a is believed to be identical to the fast-twitch Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA1) with 10 membrane-spanning domains. Based on hydropathy analysis, the extended carboxyl terminus of SERCA2b is predicted to span the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane an additional (i.e. 11th) time. We have added the human c-myc epitope, a 10-amino acid sequence recognized by monoclonal antibody 9E10, onto the carboxyl termini of SERCA2a and SERCA2b to test whether or not their carboxyl termini are on the same side of the ER membrane. The added epitopes do not appear to disrupt topology as judged from unaltered Ca2+ transport. Immunocytochemical studies demonstrate that SERCA2a and SERCA2b have their carboxyl termini on opposite sides of the ER membrane; SERCA2a's is in the cytosol and SERCA2b's is in the ER lumen."

https://openalex.org/W2172238432,"The single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB protein) is required for efficient genetic recombination in vivo. One function for SSB protein in DNA strand exchange in vitro is to remove secondary structure from single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and thereby aid in the formation of recA protein-saturated presynaptic complexes. In the preceding paper (Lavery, P. E., and Kowalczykowski, S. C. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 9307-9314) we demonstrated that DNA strand exchange can occur in the presence of volume-occupying agents at low magnesium ion concentration, where secondary structures are reduced. Our results suggest that SSB protein is not acting during presynapsis under these conditions, yet the DNA strand exchange reaction is stimulated by the addition of SSB protein. In this study we present biochemical evidence which suggests that SSB protein stimulates DNA strand exchange by binding to the ssDNA displaced from joint molecules, thereby stabilizing them and allowing branch migration to extend the region of heteroduplex DNA. Therefore, our results indicate dual roles for SSB protein at elevated magnesium ion concentration; it functions during presynapsis, removing secondary structure from ssDNA, as indicated previously, and it also functions postsynaptically, binding to the ssDNA displaced from joint molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1498492368,"The treatment of chloroplast coupling factor 1 (CF1) with dithiothreitol or with trypsin modifies the gamma subunit. Reduction of the gamma subunit disulfide bond in CF1 in solution with dithiothreitol enhances the dissociation of epsilon (Duhe, R. J., and Selman, B. R. (1990) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1017, 70-78). The Ca(2+)-ATPase activity of either oxidized or reduced CF1 increases as the enzyme is diluted. Added epsilon subunit inhibits the Ca(2+)-ATPase activity of both forms of the diluted CF1, suggesting that epsilon dissociation is the cause of activation by dilution. Half-maximal activation occurred at much higher concentrations of the reduced CF1, indicating that reduction decreases the affinity for epsilon about 20-fold. Immunoblotting techniques show that there is only one epsilon subunit/CF1 in intact chloroplasts, in thylakoid membranes, and in solution. No epsilon is released from CF1 in thylakoids under conditions of ATP synthesis. The gamma subunit of CF1 in illuminated thylakoids is specifically cleaved by trypsin. CF1 purified from thylakoids treated with trypsin in the light is deficient in epsilon subunit, and has a high rate of ATP hydrolysis. Added epsilon neither inhibits the ATPase activity of, nor binds tightly to the cleaved enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1573162261,"The malK gene, encoding a membrane-associated component of the maltose transport complex of Salmonella typhimurium was cloned into an expression vector downstream of the promoters lambda pR and lambda pL and a strong translation initiation region. Escherichia coli strain JM109 harboring the resulting plasmid pCW14 synthesized a protein of apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa upon temperature shift, as demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The identity of the protein was determined by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. The overproduced protein was sequestered in inclusion bodies as revealed by electron microscopy. The protein was purified to homogeneity on a large scale by disrupting the cells with a passage through a Ribi press, solubilizing the inclusion bodies with urea, and subsequent chromatography on Red Agarose. Purified MalK, as the membrane-bound MalK protein could be covalently modified by [gamma-32P]8-azido-ATP. Furthermore, the purified protein bound [gamma-32P] ATP with a dissociation constant of 150 microM and exhibited ATPase activity, which was stimulated by dimethyl-sulfoxide and inhibited by ADP."
https://openalex.org/W1501181431,"Rat ovarian granulosa cells synthesize two distinct species of plasma membrane-intercalated heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans; glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored and core protein-intercalated HS proteoglycans. Both species of HS proteoglycans are primarily localized on the plasma membrane. Cell surface localization of GPI-anchored and protein-intercalated HS proteoglycans can be determined by their accessibility to exogenously added phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and trypsin, respectively. Kinetic parameters for the processes involving their transfer from the Golgi to the cell surface, endocytosis and secretion, and the modes of intracellular degradation were determined by metabolic labeling experiments using [35S]sulfate and various chase protocols in combination with the use of PI-PLC and trypsin in rat ovarian granulosa cells. The experiments demonstrated that (i) both HS proteoglycan species are transferred from the Golgi to the cell surface with an average transit time of approximately 12 min. (ii) GPI-anchored HS proteoglycans are endocytosed with a t1/2 approximately 3 h, without being shed into the medium, and they are rapidly degraded, t1/2 approximately 25 min, without generating recognizable degradation intermediates. (iii) Protein-intercalated HS proteoglycans are partly (approximately 30%) shed from the cell surface into the medium and the remaining approximately 70% are endocytosed with a t1/2 approximately 4 h. After endocytosis, they undergo a slow (t1/2 approximately 4 h) stepwise degradation generating distinct HS oligosaccharides as degradation intermediates. These results indicate that the GPI-anchored and the protein-intercalated HS proteoglycans have distinct secretory, endocytotic, and intracellular degradation pathways probably due to the differences in their anchor structures."
https://openalex.org/W1595154193,"The effects of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and other eicosanoids were determined on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and lymphotoxin (LT; TNF-beta) production by murine Th1, antigen-specific major histocompatibility complex class II-restricted T cell clones. T cells activated with immobilized anti-CD3 or with soluble concanavalin A (ConA) produced approximately 100-1,000 units/ml TNF-alpha/LT as determined by cytotoxicity against the WEHI-164 murine fibrosarcoma cell line. TNF-alpha/LT biological activity was induced rapidly with significant production evident approximately 4 h after stimulation with either anti-CD3 or ConA. PGE2 inhibited the anti-CD3- and ConA-induced production of TNF-alpha/LT bioactivity in a dose-dependent manner. Incubation with 1 x 10(-9) M PGE2 inhibited production of TNF-alpha/LT biological activity from anti-CD-activated F1.28, or 450A.1 T cell clones by approximately 50%. Incubation with 1 x 10(-7) M PGE2 resulted in 90% inhibition of biological activity. PGE2 also inhibited both TNF-alpha and LT mRNA accumulation by more than 90%. These results suggest that the reduced production of cytotoxic activity in the presence of PGE2 was caused by the inhibition of both TNF-alpha and LT. No inhibition of T cell TNF-alpha or LT production was observed when anti-CD3- or ConA-activated cells were incubated with PGD2, PGF2 alpha, 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid or leukotriene C4. Nuclear run-on experiments indicated that the PGE2-mediated decrease of TNF-alpha and LT mRNA accumulation was caused, in part, by an inhibitory effect on the transcription of these genes. This is the first report of PGE2-mediated inhibition of TNF-alpha in T cells and PGE2-mediated inhibition of LT production in any cell type."
https://openalex.org/W1548587858,"GAP-43 is a neuronal calmodulin-binding phosphoprotein that is concentrated in growth cones and presynaptic terminals. By sequencing tryptic and endoproteinase Asp-N phosphopeptides and directly determining the release of radioactive phosphate, we have identified three sites (serines 41 and 96 and threonine 172) that are phosphorylated, both in cultured neurons and in neonatal rat brain. These three sites account for most of the 32PO4 that was incorporated into GAP-43 in cultured neurons; 8-15% of each site was occupied with phosphate in GAP-43 isolated from neonatal rat brain. Phosphorylation of serine 41 in cultured neurons was stimulated by phorbol ester, indicating that it is the only site phosphorylated by protein kinase C. The resemblance of the sequence surrounding the other two sites suggests that they may be substrates for the same protein kinase. None of the sites phosphorylated by casein kinase II in vitro was phosphorylated in living cells or in neonatal rat brain. These results show that GAP-43 is a substrate for at least one protein kinase in addition to protein kinase C in living cells and brain."
https://openalex.org/W1541847548,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, expression of functional F1-ATPase requires two proteins encoded by the ATP11 and ATP12 genes. Mutations in either gene block some crucial late step in assembly of F1, causing the alpha and beta subunits to accumulate in mitochondria as inactive aggregates (Ackerman, S. H., and Tzagoloff, A. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 87, 4986-4990). In the present study we have cloned and determined the sequence of ATP11. The encoded product is protein of 37 kDa with no obvious homology to any known protein. In vitro import assays of ATP11 precursor and immunochemical evidence indicate that the protein is located in mitochondria. A fusion was made between ATP11 and a short sequence coding for 78 amino acids with the biotination signal of bacterial transcarboxylase. The protein expressed from this construct complements atp11 mutants, indicating that the addition of the extra 78 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of the ATP11 protein does not compromise its function. The hybrid protein is detected in mitochondria with antibodies and with peroxidase-conjugated avidin. Biotinated ATP11 protein can be partially purified by affinity chromatography on monomeric or tetrameric avidin coupled to Sepharose. A fraction eluted from the avidin column and enriched for the biotinated ATP11 protein also contains the alpha and beta subunits of F1-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1508107852,"A factor that activates affinity-purified vacuolar H(+)-ATPase from bovine kidney microsomes was identified and partially purified from bovine kidney cytosol. The activator is a heat-stable, trypsin-sensitive acidic protein with a Mr by gel filtration of approximately 35,000. The activator increased the activity of renal microsomal and brush border H(+)-ATPase by over 60% but stimulated lysosomal H(+)-ATPase activity by only 28%; it had little or no activity against the remaining N-ethylmaleimide-insensitive ATPase in kidney microsomes and other transport ATPases. Stimulation of ATPase activity appeared to result from binding of the activator to the H(+)-ATPase. Activation was saturable, with a Hill coefficient of 1 at low protein concentrations. Both activator binding and stimulation of H(+)-ATPase activity were enhanced at pH values less than or equal to 6.5. The activator has selective effects on different H(+)-ATPases and is poised to activate the enzyme at low physiologic values of cytosolic pH; this newly identified cytosolic proteins may participate in the physiologic regulation of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1537694660,"3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and responds to rapid degradation which is regulated by mevalonate or sterols. T cell antigen receptor alpha chain (TCR alpha) is also known to be rapidly degraded within the ER. In both cases, the membrane domains of the proteins have a crucial role in their rapid degradation. In order to investigate protein degradation in the ER, we compared the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase and TCR alpha in the same Chinese hamster ovary cells. Among the protease inhibitors tested, N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-methioninal blocks the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase and also inhibits the degradation of TCR alpha. On the other hand, N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone and N-carbobenzoxy-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone inhibit the degradation of TCR alpha but have no effect on the degradation of HMG-CoA reductase. Diamide, a thiol-oxidizing agent, blocks the degradation of both HMG-CoA reductase and TCR alpha. Perturbation of cellular Ca2+ attenuates the rapid degradation of HMG-CoA reductase but does not affect the degradation of TCR alpha. Furthermore, thapsigargin, a selective ER Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor, and Co2+, a potent Ca2+ antagonist, increase the half-life of HMG-CoA reductase but not that of TCR alpha. Energy inhibitors diminish the rapid degradation of HMG-CoA reductase but not that of TCR alpha. These results suggest that although HMG-CoA reductase and TCR alpha appear to be degraded in the same subcellular compartment, the mechanisms responsible for degradation differ."
https://openalex.org/W1492283404,"Although DNA helicases play important roles in the processing of DNA, little is known about the effects of DNA-interacting ligands on these helicases. Therefore, the effects of a wide variety of DNA-binding ligands on the unwinding and ATPase reactions catalyzed by Escherichia coli DNA helicase II were examined. DNA minor groove binders and simple DNA intercalators did not inhibit helicase II. However, DNA intercalators, such as mitoxantrone and nogalamycin, which position functionalities in the major groove upon binding duplex DNA, were potent inhibitors of helicase II. To determine the mechanism by which mitoxantrone inhibited helicase II, the unwinding and DNA-dependent ATPase activities of helicase II were measured using a spectrum of double- and single-stranded DNA substrates. Using either a 71-base pair (bp) M13mp7 partially duplexed DNA substrate or a 245-bp bluntended, fully duplexed DNA substrate, the apparent Ki value for inhibition by mitoxantrone of both the unwinding and ATPase reactions was approximately 1 microM for both substrates, suggesting that the mechanism of inhibition of helicase II by mitoxantrone is the same for both substrates and requires the presence of double-stranded structure. To strengthen this conclusion, the ability of mitoxantrone to inhibit the DNA-dependent ATPase activity of helicase II was determined using two single-stranded substrates, poly(dT) and the 245-bp substrate after heat denaturation. Using either substrate, mitoxantrone inhibited the ATPase activity of helicase II far less effectively. Thus, these results indicate that the intercalation of mitoxantrone into double-stranded DNA, with accompanying placement of functionalities in the major groove, generates a complex that impedes helicase II, resulting in both inhibition of ATP hydrolysis and unwinding activity. Furthermore, we report here that DNA-binding ligands inhibit the unwinding activity of helicases I and IV and Rep protein from E. coli, demonstrating that the inhibition observed for helicase II is not unique to this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1561708917,"Studies on N-linked oligosaccharide processing in the mouse lymphoma glucosidase II-deficient mutant cell line (PHAR2.7) as well as the parent BW5147 cells indicated that the former maintain their capacity to synthesize complex carbohydrate units through the use of the deglucosylation mechanism provided by endomannosidase. The in vivo activity of this enzyme was evident in the mutant cells from their production of substantial amounts of glucosylated mannose saccharides, predominantly Glc2Man; moreover, in the presence of 1-deoxymannojirimycin or kifunensine to prevent processing by mannosidase I, N-linked Man8GlcNAc2 was observed entirely in the form of the characteristic isomer in which the terminal mannose of the alpha 1,3-linked branch is missing (isomer A). In contrast, parent lymphoma cells, as well as HepG2 cells in the presence of 1-deoxymannojirimycin accumulated Man9GlcNAc2 as the primary deglucosylated N-linked oligosaccharide and contained only about 16% of their Man8GlcNAc2 as isomer A. In the presence of the glucosidase inhibitor castanospermine the mutant released Glc3Man instead of Glc2Man, and the parent cells converted their deglucosylation machinery to the endomannosidase route. Despite the mutant's capacity to accommodate a large traffic through this pathway no increase in the in vitro determined endomannosidase activity was evident. The exclusive utilization of endomannosidase by the mutant for the deglucosylation of its predominant N-linked Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 permitted an exploration of the in vivo site of this enzyme's action. Pulse-chase studies utilizing sucrose-D2O density gradient centrifugation indicated that the Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 to Man8GlcNAc2 conversion is a relatively late event that is temporally separated from the endoplasmic reticulum-situated processing of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 to Glc2Man9GlcNAc2 and in contrast to the latter takes place in the Golgi compartment."
https://openalex.org/W1558562447,"Abstract The highly homologous small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated proteins of the Sm group, human N and B/B', are derived from distinct, but similar genes. While the almost identical structural organization of the genes for N and B/B' suggests that they emerged from a common ancestral gene via a duplication event, they now reside on different chromosomes. In contrast to B (which is expressed in all tissues examined) and B' (which is widely expressed with the notable exception of the brain), results from in situ hybridization experiments showed that N is found predominantly in central neurons. Analysis of the transcriptional activity of the 5'-flanking sequences of the human N-encoded gene suggests that the cell-specific expression of N is achieved by selective repression of transcription by distal 5'-flanking sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1520352463,"Protein S and C4b-binding protein (C4BP) form a tight complex (Kd approximately 0.6 nM) the physiologic purpose of which is unknown. The participation of protein S in this complex was investigated using site-specific mutagenesis. Normal recombinant human protein S (rHPS) and five specifically mutated protein S analogs were expressed in transformed human kidney 293 cells and the following properties were characterized: solution-phase C4BP binding, ability to be cleaved by thrombin, ability to act as a cofactor in the activated protein C-catalyzed inactivation of factor Va, and gamma-carboxyglutamic acid content. In some cases, beta-hydroxyaspartic acid plus beta-hydroxyasparagine content was also determined. Binding studies indicated that while clearly important for a high affinity interaction, the amino acid sequence Gly605-Ile614 identified by Walker (Walker, F J. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 17645-17648) does not account for all the binding energy of the HPS-C4BP interaction. All mutants perturbed in this region or lacking it altogether displayed reduced C4BP binding, and some retained anticoagulant cofactor function. Neither human factor X nor human steroid-binding protein had any measurable ability to compete with plasma HPS for C4BP binding. Furthermore, bovine protein S and a rHPS analog with bovine sequence from Gly597-Trp629 bound to human C4BP with the same affinity as did HPS, and both proteins substituted effectively for HPS as a cofactor for activated protein C in an otherwise human anticoagulation system. Together these results suggest that optimal binding of protein S to C4BP requires the putative alpha-helix Gly605-Ile614, as well as other undetermined regions of protein S, and that the regions of HPS responsible for C4BP binding and activated protein C cofactor function are structurally isolated."
https://openalex.org/W1524015946,"To investigate the in vivo effects of macromolecular crowding we examined the effect of inert macromolecules such as polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene glycol on the in vitro activity of recA protein. The addition of either of these volume-occupying agents enables recA protein to promote homologous pairing and exchange of DNA strands at an otherwise nonpermissive magnesium ion concentration. In the presence of these macromolecules, both the rate of recA protein association with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and the steady-state affinity of recA protein for ssDNA are increased. Consequently, the ability of recA protein to compete with ssDNA-binding protein (SSB protein) is enhanced, and the inhibitory effects of SSB protein on the formation of recA protein-ssDNA presynaptic complexes are eliminated. Because the ability of recA protein to bind to ssDNA-containing secondary structures is also enhanced in volume-occupied solution, joint molecule formation is not greatly reduced when SSB protein is omitted from the reaction. Thus, increased recA protein interactions with ssDNA contribute to enhanced presynaptic complex formation. In addition, polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene glycol must also affect another property of recA protein, i.e. self-association, which is required for synapsis and DNA strand exchange. Our examination of DNA strand exchange in the presence of volume-occupying agents helps to reconcile the requirement for elevated magnesium ion concentrations in recA protein-promoted recombination reactions in vitro, with a presumably low magnesium ion concentration in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1569043365,"It has been proposed that during T cell receptor antigen recognition, CD4- or CD8-p56lck molecules interact with the T cell antigen receptor-CD3 complex (TCR-CD3) to phosphorylate various undefined substrates, which then initiate signal transduction through the TCR-CD3 complex. The ability of CD4 to modulate the TCR-CD3-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+, [Ca2+]i, and substrate tyrosine phosphorylation was studied in mutants of the human leukemic T cell line HPB-ALL characterized by their low expression of the TCR-CD3 complex on the cell surface. In TCR-CD3low cells, in which CD3-zeta was found to be associated with the TCR-CD3 complex, cross-linking CD3 with CD4 resulted in a profile of calcium mobilization, CD3-zeta, and phospholipase C-gamma 1 tyrosine phosphorylation similar to that observed in HPB-ALL cells, although the magnitude of generalized substrate tyrosine phosphorylation appeared to be smaller, as compared with wild-type cells. Responses were weak or absent when CD3 was cross-linked alone. In contrast, in a mutant in which association of CD3-zeta 2 with the TCR-CD3 was defective, cross-linking of CD3 with CD4 had a weaker effect on any of the activation parameters tested. These experiments showed that the presence of CD3-zeta 2 in the TCR-CD3 complex is of critical importance for the ability of CD4 to enhance early transducing signals inside the cell. The data also suggest that CD4-associated protein tyrosine kinase p56lck could up-regulate defective CD3-mediated induction of phospholipase C activity by increasing tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-gamma 1."
https://openalex.org/W1480263023,"Blockage of the progress of a DNA replication fork in Escherichia coli can be ascribed to an inhibition of helicase action at the orientation-specific binding of a termination sequence (ter) by the ter-binding protein (Lee, E.H., Kornberg, A., Hidaka, M., Kobayashi, T., and Horiuchi, T. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86, 9104-9108). These observations have been extended to include the PriA helicase, thus confirming that blockage is general for helicases. The site of arrest of synthesis by a replication fork is at the very first nucleotide of the 22-base pair E. coli-terB sequence. Strand displacement by DNA polymerases is also inhibited, but is less profound and is orientation-specific. The ter sequences of plasmids R1-terR and -terL and of plasmids R6K and R100 have been compared with those of E. coli-terA and -terB."
https://openalex.org/W1556064830,"Three efficient mouse interferon gamma (MoIFN gamma) inhibitors were constructed, which consist of the MoIFN gamma receptor (MoIFN gamma R) extracellular portion and constant domains of immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules. These are: 1) the constant domain of the mouse kappa chain, 2) the hinge region and the constant domains 2 and 3 of the mouse gamma 2a chain, and 3) the hinge region and the constant domains 2 and 3 of the human gamma 3 chain. The hybrid molecules were expressed in the mouse myeloma cell line J558L and recovered from the supernatants of cell cultures in one purification step. The proteins MoIFN gamma R-M gamma 2a and MoIFN gamma R-H gamma 3 form homodimers, whereas MoIFN gamma R-M kappa is a monomer. All three constructs inhibit the binding of radiolabeled MoIFN gamma to its receptor on L1210 cells. They are biologically active in vitro, neutralizing the action of MoIFN gamma in an antiviral activity assay. The fusions of Ig regions to the soluble MoIFN gamma R do not decrease the affinity of the binding site for the ligand. MoIFN gamma R-M kappa has about the same affinity as the soluble MoIFN gamma R and the cell surface receptor of L1210 cells in situ, which are also monomers, whereas the dimers MoIFN gamma R-M gamma 2a and MoIFN gamma R-H gamma 3 display a 5-10-fold higher affinity for MoIFN gamma than the monomeric molecules. This is best documented in the efficacy of the inhibitors to antagonize the antiviral activity of MoIFN gamma, as the dimeric constructs are about 10 times more active than MoIFN gamma R-M kappa and the soluble MoIFN gamma R. The hybrid constructs can be used as high efficiency MoIFN gamma inhibitors in mouse models of several pathological states in humans, where IFN gamma is thought to play a disease-promoting role."
https://openalex.org/W1492819534,"We attempted to establish whether lanthanide ions, when added to sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes in the absence of nucleotide, compete with Ca2+ for binding to the transport sites of the Ca(2+)-ATPase in these membranes, or whether they bind to different sites. Equilibrium measurements of the effect of lanthanide ions on the intrinsic fluorescence of SR ATPase and on 45Ca2+ binding to it were performed either at neutral pH (pH 6.8), i.e. when endogenous or contaminating Ca2+ was sufficient to nearly saturate the ATPase transport sites, or at acid pH (pH 5.5), which greatly reduced the affinity of calcium for its sites on the ATPase. These measurements did reveal apparent competition between Ca2+ and the lanthanide ions La3+, Gd3+, Pr3+, and Tb3+, which all behaved similarly, but this competition displayed unexpected features: lanthanide ions displaced Ca2+ with a moderate affinity and in a noncooperative way, and the pH dependence of this displacement was smaller than that of the Ca2+ binding to its own sites. Simultaneously, we directly measured the amount of Tb3+ bound to the ATPase relative to the amount of Ca2+ and found that Tb3+ ions only reduced significantly the amount of Ca2+ bound after a considerable number of Tb3+ ions had bound. Furthermore, when we tested the effect of Ca2+ on the amount of Tb3+ bound to the SR membranes, we found that the Tb3+ ions which bound at low Tb3+ concentrations were not displaced when Ca2+ was added at concentrations which saturated the Ca2+ transport sites. We conclude that the sites on SR ATPase to which lanthanide ions bind with the highest affinity are not the high affinity Ca2+ binding and transport sites. At higher concentrations, lanthanide ions did not appear to be able to replace Ca2+ ions and preserve the native structure of their binding pocket, as evaluated in rapid filtration measurements from the effect of moderate concentrations of lanthanide ions on the kinetics of Ca2+ dissociation. Thus, the presence of lanthanide ions slowed down the dissociation from its binding site of the first, superficially bound 45Ca2+ ion, instead of specifically preventing the dissociation of the deeply bound 45Ca2+ ion. These results highlight the need for caution when interpreting, in terms of calcium sites, experimental data collected using lanthanide ions as spectroscopic probes on SR membrane ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1592878947,"A lambda phage expression methodology was adapted to dissect protein/ligand interactions efficiently through the creation and rapid screening of large numbers of mutants. Here we describe the method and its specific application to the interaction between the external envelope glycoprotein of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), gp120, and the human cell surface protein CD4. Random substitutions were introduced throughout the gp120 binding region (amino acids 38-62) in the amino-terminal domain of CD4 by oligonucleotide mutagenesis. These mutations were expressed within phage plaques and directly screened for their effect on binding of gp120 using a modified phage plaque lift procedure. Plaques showing increased, decreased, and no effect on binding were identified and mutations were verified by sequence analysis. In this manner, 25 unique mutations were identified that altered CD4 binding to gp120. A new site was identified at which mutations reduced binding to gp120 and several novel amino acid substitutions were defined at sites previously implicated in binding. Of particular interest, this in vitro genetic approach identified a mutation which significantly increased binding to gp120. The phenotypes of several of these mutants were further characterized by quantitative measurement of their binding affinity. The results confirmed the accuracy of the phenotypic selection and demonstrated that the sensitivity of the system allowed detection of a 3-4-fold increase or decrease in affinity. In the context of the recently determined atomic structure of CD4, these results further implicate residues in the CDR2-like region and in an adjacent loop in recognition of gp120. This methodology should be generally applicable to other high affinity protein/ligand interactions that are compatible with expression in Escherichia coli."
https://openalex.org/W1576773794,"A binding site for divalent metal ions on the ATPase from Halobacterium saccharovorum is proposed. This site is different from the catalytic site which binds ATP and a complexed divalent metal ion. Occupation of the second site greatly stimulates the rate of ATP hydrolysis and the affinity of the catalytic site for the metal ion-ATP complex. The time-dependent inhibition of the ATPase, which occurs during catalysis and which is known to be caused by the retention of ADP, is also dependent on the occupation of this metal ion binding site. The binding of the metal ion apparently induces extremely tight binding of ADP after the departure of Pi. Mg2+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Co2+, and Ca2+ were tested and showed both the activating and the inhibitory effects, although their binding constants for ATP and the second metal ion binding site were quite different. The characteristic shapes of the nonlinear ATP hydrolysis curves obtained with different metal ions, and different ratios of metal ion and ATP, could be explained with the established dissociation constants. On this basis, a model for the ATPase was developed with two catalytic cycles: one in which the second metal ion binding site is occupied, and another in which it is empty. These pathways are connected by metal ion-dependent equilibria."
https://openalex.org/W1548603950,"A cytosolic insulin-sensitive serine kinase has been purified to apparent homogeneity in parallel from livers of control or acutely insulin-treated rats. The kinase is labile and requires rapid purification for stability. The kinase migrates as a band of apparent Mr = 90,000 on denaturing gels and elutes as a monomer on Superose 12 gel filtration. After sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and renaturation, the 90-kDa band presumed to be the kinase shows kinase activity toward myelin basic protein in situ. Substrates of the kinase include Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide), ribosomal protein S6, S6 peptide, a proline-rich peptide substrate, microtubule-associated protein 2, and myelin basic protein. The kinase also phosphorylates histones H1 and H2B, but does not autophosphorylate to a significant stoichiometry. The activity of the kinase is inhibited by fluoride, glycerophosphate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, p-nitrophenol, heparin, quercetin, poly-L-lysine, and potassium phosphate, but is unaffected by calcium, cAMP, spermine, protein kinase inhibitor peptide, phorbol myristate acetate, calcium plus phosphatidylserine, or vanadate. The kinase will utilize magnesium (10 mM) as well as manganese (1 mM) as a cofactor for maximal phosphotransferase activity. The kinase is not detected by immunoblotting with antibodies directed against protein kinase C or type II S6 kinase. Taken together, these properties distinguish this kinase from other insulin-sensitive kinases that have been described previously. The purified kinase from livers of insulin-treated rats shows a 5-20-fold higher specific activity compared to enzyme prepared from control rats, suggesting a covalent modification as the mechanism of activation. Incubation of purified, insulin-stimulated kinase with purified phosphatase 2A leads to deactivation of the kinase activity, and the phosphatase inhibitor nitrophenyl phosphate blocks this deactivation. The insulin-activated kinase fails to immunoblot with anti-tyrosine phosphate antibodies. Taken together, these results indicate that insulin activates this novel cytosolic protein kinase by a mechanism that causes its phosphorylation on serine or threonine residues."

https://openalex.org/W2120612339,"The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor of the plasma membrane-associated heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan was metabolically radiolabeled with [3H]myristic acid, [3H]palmitic acid, [3H]inositol, [3H]ethanolamine, or [32P]phosphate in rat ovarian granulosa cell culture. Cell cultures labeled with [3H]myristic acid or [3H]palmitic acid were extracted with 4 M guanidine HCl buffer containing 2% Triton X-100 and the proteoglycans were purified by ion exchange chromatography after extensive delipidation. Specific incorporation of 3H into GPI-anchor was demonstrated by removing the label with a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC). Incorporation of 3H activity into glycosaminoglycans and core glycoproteins was also demonstrated. However, the specific activity of 3H in these structures was approximately 2 orders of magnitude lower than that in the GPI-anchor, suggesting that 3H label was the result of the metabolic utilization of catabolic products of the 3H-labeled fatty acids. PI-PLC treatment of cell cultures metabolically labeled with [3H]inositol, [3H]ethanolamine, or [32P]phosphate specifically released radiolabeled cell surface-associated HS proteoglycans indicating the presence of GPI-anchor in these proteoglycans. GPI-anchored HS proteoglycans accounted for 20-30% of the total cell surface-associated HS proteoglycans and virtually all of them were removed by PI-PLC. These results further substantiate the presence of GPI-anchored heparan sulfate proteoglycan in ovarian granulosa cells and its cell surface localization."
https://openalex.org/W1590500653,"The intracellular events which are involved in controlling the G1 to S phase transition during the eucaryotic cell cycle are important to define in order to understand the mechanisms by which mitogenic and growth arrest-inducing agents control cell growth. Because a change in protein kinase activity is associated with the initial response of cells to mitogenic stimulants and growth factors, we used a kinase renaturation assay to identify specific protein kinases which are modulated as human T cells make the G1 to S phase transition after mitogenic stimulation with lectin. We identified four protein serine/threonine kinases of 180, 97, 85, and 38 kilodaltons which are increased in activity as these cells enter S phase. A-55 kDa serine/threonine kinase (PK55) was shown to have maximal activity during G0 and its activity was reduced by 95% upon movement into S phase. PK55 is inducible in human T cells by removal of interleukin 2 and low serum incubation which arrests cells in G1 phase, indicating that it is closely associated with G1 phase growth arrest. Furthermore, a similar PK55 activity was induced upon growth arrest in HL-60 cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide and in Daudi cells treated with interferon alpha. Because the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PK-A) family has been shown to be antiproliferative to lectin stimulated T cells, we were interested in determining whether PK55 was in fact an isozyme of PK-A. Comparative analysis using a specific peptide inhibitor of PK-A activity revealed that PK55 is catalytically distinct from PK-A. This data suggest that increases in PK55 may be associated with the growth-arrested state and further that PK55 is distinct from PK-A."
