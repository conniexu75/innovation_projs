Here, we report the isolation to near purity of human normal mammary SCs (hNMSCs), from cultured mammospheres, on the basis of their ability to retain the lipophilic dye PKH26 as a consequence of their quiescent nature. PKH26-positive cells possess all the characteristics of hNMSCs. The transcriptional profile of PKH26-positive cells (hNMSC signature) was able to predict biological and molecular features of breast cancers. By using markers of the hNMSC signature, we prospectively isolated SCs from the normal gland and from breast tumors. Poorly differentiated (G3) cancers displayed higher content of prospectively isolated cancer SCs (CSCs) than did well-differentiated (G1) cancers. By comparing G3 and G1 tumors in xenotransplantation experiments, we directly demonstrated that G3s are enriched in CSCs. Our data support the notion that the heterogeneous phenotypical and molecular traits of human breast cancers are a function of their CSC content.

Human mammary stem cells (hNMSCs) can be isolated to a high degree of purity hNMSCs have a distinctive molecular signature The signature distinguishes breast cancers of different grades and molecular subtypes Breast cancer stem cell content relates to degree of differentiation and prognosis Cancer is frequently characterized by the alteration of pathways that control the homeostasis of normal stem cells (SCs) (Visvader and Lindeman, 2008Visvader J.E. Lindeman G.J. Cancer stem cells in solid tumours: accumulating evidence and unresolved questions.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 755-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar). The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that govern normal SC function might, therefore, advance our understanding of tumorigenesis. In the mammary gland, resident multipotent mammary SCs (MSCs) orchestrate the development of the gland during embryogenesis, and its modifications in postnatal life (Williams and Daniel, 1983Williams J.M.

Since MSCs are rare, their purification constitutes a major hurdle to their characterization. A number of approaches, based on the exploitation of MSC surface markers, have allowed the prospective isolation of mouse and human MSCs (Eirew et al., 2008Eirew P. Stingl J. Raouf A. Turashvili G.

However, the relative promiscuity of these markers (Carter et al., 1990Carter W.G. Kaur P. Gil S.G. Gahr P.J. Wayner E.A.

Purification and unique properties of mammary epithelial stem cells.Nature. 2006; 439: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar) limits their usefulness when highly purified MSCs are needed. At the onset of the present study, we devised a strategy to obtain highly pure populations of MSCs, based on their functional, rather than immunophenotypical, characteristics, and relying on the “mammosphere” technology (Dontu et al., 2003Dontu G. Abdallah W.M. Foley J.M. Jackson K.W. Clarke M.F. Kawamura M.J. Wicha M.S. In vitro propagation and transcriptional profiling of human mammary stem/progenitor cells.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1253-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). Since MSCs can withstand anoikis, they proliferate/differentiate in anchorage-independent conditions, giving rise to clonal spheroids, which can in part recapitulate the mammary morphogenetic program. MSCs, however, constitute less than 1% of all cells in a mammosphere (Dontu et al., 2003Dontu G. Abdallah W.M. Foley J.M. Jackson K.W. Clarke M.F. Kawamura M.J. Wicha M.S. In vitro propagation and transcriptional profiling of human mammary stem/progenitor cells.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1253-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). To identify this fraction of cells, we used a lipophilic fluorescent dye, PKH26, which labels relatively quiescent cells within a proliferating population (Huang et al., 1999Huang S. Law P. Francis K. Palsson B.O. Ho A.D. Symmetry of initial cell divisions among primitive hematopoietic progenitors is independent of ontogenic age and regulatory molecules.Blood. 1999; 94: 2595-2604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Lanzkron et al., 1999Lanzkron S.M. Collector M.I. Sharkis S.J. Hematopoietic stem cell tracking in vivo: a comparison of short-term and long-term repopulating cells.Blood. 1999; 93: 1916-1921PubMed Google Scholar). During the growth of a mammosphere, the rare quiescent/slowly dividing MSCs retain PKH26 epifluorescence, while the bulk population, derived from the proliferation of progenitors of the transit-amplifying compartment, progressively lose it by dilution. We were able to purify, by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), a minority of PKH-positive (PKHPOS) cells from human mammospheres to near homogeneity and to show that they represent human normal MSCs (hNMSCs). We then obtained the transcriptional profile of PKHPOS/hNMSCs and compared it to that of their immediate progeny, thus identifying a hNMSC signature. The apparently simple cytoarchitecture of the mammary gland, composed of an internal layer of luminal epithelial cells and an external layer of myoepithelial cells, is difficult to reconcile with the diversity of breast cancer phenotypes (Stingl and Caldas, 2007Stingl J. Caldas C. Molecular heterogeneity of breast carcinomas and the cancer stem cell hypothesis.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This has led to the hypothesis that, despite its morphological simplicity, the mammary gland is functionally complex and molecularly heterogeneous (Stingl and Caldas, 2007Stingl J. Caldas C. Molecular heterogeneity of breast carcinomas and the cancer stem cell hypothesis.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). This hypothesis has stimulated much study and debate regarding the cellular origin of breast cancer subtypes, as it affects our ability to predict tumor behavior and responsiveness to therapy (Stingl and Caldas, 2007Stingl J. Caldas C. Molecular heterogeneity of breast carcinomas and the cancer stem cell hypothesis.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2007; 7: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). With this background in mind, we used the hNMSC signature to interrogate expression data sets of breast cancers. We discovered that the signature can stratify breast cancers according to their biological and molecular features. We further showed that this is due to the different number of cancer SCs (CSCs) (or cancer-initiating cells) present within different types of breast tumors. Based on our data, we propose a model of breast tumorigenesis that might resolve the incongruence between the complexity of breast cancer phenotypes and the simplicity of the normal breast parenchyma. Cells from normal human mammary glands were labeled with PKH26 and plated in suspension to allow mammosphere growth (Figure S1A available online). As expected, very few cells within mammospheres retained strong epifluorescence (Figure 1A ). The sphere-forming efficiency (SFE) of cells from the mammary gland was 0.003%–0.01% (depending on whether bulk mammary cells or pre-enriched mammary epithelial cells were employed, Figure S1B). The SFE of cells obtained from dissociated mammospheres was ∼0.1% (F2 in Figure S1B). Normal mammospheres could be propagated for at least four generations (Figure 1B), and their clonogenic ability decreased exponentially (Figure 1B, Figure S1C): at every generation, the SFE was ∼23% of that measured in the preceding generation (Figure S1C). Mammospheres reproducibly contained ∼300 cells per sphere (Figure S1D).Figure 1Identification and Purification of hNMSCsShow full caption(A) A mammosphere derived from PKH26-labeled epithelial cells.

See also Figure S1. We estimated that in the normal mammary gland there is one mammosphere-initiating cell per ∼7500 total cells or ∼2000 epithelial cells (Figure S1D), in good agreement with previous reports in mouse and human (Shackleton et al., 2006Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Simpson K.J. Stingl J. Smyth G.K. Asselin-Labat M.L. Wu L. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E.

Vaillant F. Choi D. Li H.I. Eaves C.J. Purification and unique properties of mammary epithelial stem cells.Nature. 2006; 439: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). In addition, we calculated that approximately one mammosphere-initiating cell is present per mammosphere, and that this cell is likely found within the PKH26-positive (PKHPOS) cell fraction (Figure S1D). This was confirmed by monitoring of the ability of single cells, obtained from dissociated mammospheres, to form second-generation mammospheres, as a function of their PKH positivity. Only PKHPOS cells formed mammospheres, with a SFE of ∼23% (PKHPOS pre-FACS in Figure S1B; note that this number is in agreement with the maximum expected SFE, Figures S1B and S1C). We used FACS to isolate PKHPOS cells. Based on the typical PKH26 distribution in mammospheres and the SFE of cells from mammospheres, we isolated the most epifluorescent 0.2%–0.4% of the total cell population (PKHPOS cells, gated at 103–104 fluorescence units), as well as a “dull” population (gated at 101–102 fluorescence units, PKHNEG cells) (Figure S1A, inset). Only the PKHPOS population gave rise to mammospheres (Figure S1A, inset), with a SFE of ∼11% (Figure S1B; note that on the basis of this value and a series of normalizations, we estimate that our PKHPOS population is ∼90% pure, Figure S1B). Of note, PKHPOS cells could support at least four additional generations of mammosphere growth (Figure 1C, Figure S1C). By monitoring microscopically the growth of PKHPOS cells embedded in methylcellulose, we established that mammospheres are truly the result of the clonal expansion of single PKHPOS cells (Figure 1D). PKHPOS, but not PKHNEG, cells showed features of the quiescent state, as evidenced by retention of BrdU and absence of expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67 (Figure 1E). Moreover, PKHPOS cells divided asymmetrically, as demonstrated by the unequal partitioning at mitosis of the cell fate determinant Numb (Figures 1F and 1G) (Gönczy, 2008Gönczy P. Mechanisms of asymmetric cell division: flies and worms pave the way.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). We analyzed PKHPOS cells, by immunofluorescence (IF), with a panel of markers (Experimental Procedures). PKHPOS cells shared features with both epithelial (CD24+/EpCAM+) and myoepithelial (CD49F+/CK5+/TP63+) cells (Figure 2A , Figure S2A ); however, they did not express detectable terminal differentiation markers, such as Muc1, E-cadherin, and ASMA (data not shown), suggesting that lineage specification has not yet occurred in these cells. PKHNEG cells, conversely, expressed little or no CD24, CD49F, and TP63; compared to PKHPOS cells, they displayed similar levels of EpCAM and lower levels of CK5 (Figure 2A, Figure S2A). Finally, PKHNEG cells did not display detectable levels of Muc1 or ASMA (data not shown).Figure S2Related to Figure 2Show full captionAdditional characterizations of hNMSCs. A.

Bar, 500 μm. Original magnifications are also indicated. These findings suggest that, as expected of SCs, PKHPOS cells are bipotent. This was confirmed in 2D-differentiation assays on Matrigel. The majority (∼87%) of colonies generated by PKHPOS cells expressed both epithelial (EpCAM) and myoepithelial (ASMA) markers (Figure 2B, Figure S2B). Within these colonies, individual cells expressed either EpCAM or ASMA, but never both, indicating terminal differentiation of cells into either the epithelial or the myoepithelial lineage (Figure 2B, Figure S2B). By contrast, PKHNEG cells originated either pure epithelial colonies (97%) or, in rarer cases, pure myoepithelial colonies (Figure 2B, Figure S2B). When individual colonies were picked and replated in suspension, bipotent colonies, originating from PKHPOS cells, formed mammospheres at high efficiency, whereas lineage-restricted colonies (either epithelial—originating from PKHPOS or PKHNEG cells—or myoepithelial—originating from PKHNEG cells) were unable to do so (data not shown). We also used 3D Matrigel cultures, in which hNMSCs can generate mammary gland organotypic outgrowths (Dontu et al., 2003Dontu G. Abdallah W.M. Foley J.M. Jackson K.W. Clarke M.F. Kawamura M.J. Wicha M.S. In vitro propagation and transcriptional profiling of human mammary stem/progenitor cells.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1253-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). PKHPOS cells generated two types of outgrowths, which recapitulated several aspects of the mammary gland in vivo: hollow, branched lobuloalveolar, and cavitated, acinar-like structures (Figure 2C). Both epithelial (E-cadherin+) and myoepithelial (TP63+) cells could be detected in the acinar-like structures (Figure 2D) by immunohistochemistry (IHC). In addition, these structures accumulated β-casein in the lumen, upon prolactin stimulation (Figure 2E). PKHNEG cells did not form 3D structures, but either grew as monolayers of terminally differentiated cells (Figure 2C) or formed small structures that never reached the dimension or acquired the differentiation-specific features detected in the outgrowths generated by PKHPOS cells (data not shown). Finally, we analyzed the ability of PKHPOS cells to reconstitute a normal mammary epithelium when transplanted into humanized epithelium-cleared fat pads of immunocompromised NOD/SCID mice. PKHPOS cells were able to do so with an efficiency of around 4% (one in 26 cells, range 1:10–66), while PKHNEG cells could not reconstitute the mammary gland, even when injected at concentrations as high as 105 cells/transplant (Figure 2F). Of note, this value is compatible with the maximum expected value of reconstitution, estimated on the basis of the replicative kinetics of PKHPOS cells (Figure S1E). The outgrowths generated by PKHPOS cells displayed the normal mammary gland cytoarchitecture (Figure 2G, Figure S2C) and were derived unequivocally from transplanted human cells (Figure 2G, Figure S2D). We performed expression profile analysis of PKHPOS and PKHNEG cells. We extracted RNAs from FACS-sorted cells derived from three independent pools of mammospheres, each from five to six individuals. We compared profiles of PKHPOS and PKHNEG cells for each pool and obtained three separate gene lists of differentially expressed genes (see the Experimental Procedures). Considering the heterogeneity of the samples (see above), the three lists overlapped significantly (Figure 3A ). In particular, 2306 probesets (psets) (the “hNMSC signature”) showed a concordant trend of regulation (increased/decreased in two pools, and unchanged in the third one), and significant enrichment (p < 1 × 10−8, Figure 3A). Within this group, 377 psets (the “3/3 signature”) were consistently up- or downregulated in all the three pools (expected 8.35, actual 377, enrichment factor 45.11, p < 1 × 10−60, Figure 3A). The genes of the hNMSC signature and of the 3/3 signature are listed in Table S1, together with their functional annotation and other characteristics that will be discussed later (see the Discussion). The hNMSC signature, which readily distinguished PKHPOS from PKHNEG cells (Figure 3B), was validated by testing the expression of 69 transcripts on three independent RNA preparations of PKHPOS and PKHNEG cells, with 64% concordance with the GeneChip data (83% if one considers only those genes, 53, for which a reliable trend of regulation could be obtained, Table S1). Similar results were obtained if only transcripts present in the 3/3 signature were considered (Table S1). We also used IF to validate the expression of selected genes (based on the antibody availability) upregulated in PKHPOS (JAG1, SOX4, DNER, and DLL1/DELTA) or PKHNEG (HEY1) cells. JAG1, SOX4, DNER, and DLL1 were significantly enriched in PKHPOS cells, whereas HEY1 was enriched in PKHNEG cells (Figures 3C and 3D). Finally, we selected markers (CK5, TP63, and SERPINB5/Maspin, for which antibodies suitable for IHC are available), from those upregulated in PKHPOS cells, to test whether they could identify hNMSCs within mammospheres. All three markers were expressed in rare (frequently single) cells within the mammosphere (Figure S3A ). hNMSCs are thought to reside in the basal layer of ducts and/or at the level of the duct-branch points (Chepko and Smith, 1997Chepko G.

Vaillant F. Choi D. Li H.I. Eaves C.J. Purification and unique properties of mammary epithelial stem cells.Nature. 2006; 439: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). We analyzed the expression of markers from the hNMSC signature (DLL1, CK5, CD49F, JAG1, and TOPO2A) by IF (Figure 3E, Figure S3B) or IHC (Figure S3B) on sections of human mammary glands. In IF experiments, we used double labeling with EpCAM, which allows the visualization of the epithelial layer. Since we have shown that PKHPOS cells are EpCAM+, double-positive staining for EpCAM and the selected hNMSC marker should identify those rare cells displaying an EpCAM+/hNMSC-marker+ phenotype as putative hNMSCs. Indeed, such rare double-positive cells were found to reside in close proximity to the basal/myoepithelial layer in ducts, or at the duct-branch point (Figure 3E, Figure S3B). Next, we used surface markers, derived from the hNMSC signature, to isolate cells endowed with mammosphere-forming ability, directly from the mammary gland. We used markers (CD24, CD49F, DNER, and DLL1) for which we had confirmed the differential protein expression between PKHPOS and PKHNEG cells (Figures 2A and 3C). In monoparametric FACS, all markers were able to select populations enriched in mammosphere-forming cells, as witnessed by SFEs 15- to 50-fold higher than that of the bulk mammary population (Table 1, Figure S4A ). Of note, DNER and DLL1, which were not previously known as hNMSC markers, were the most efficient ones (Table 1). We then tested our markers in three combinations (CD24/CD49F/DNER, CD24/CD49F/DLL1, and CD49F/DNER/DLL1) in triparametric sorting.

https://openalex.org/W2170921940,"Spin into Control Spintronics—the use of the spin direction of subatomic particles to control on and off states, instead of electric charge—has the potential to create low-power electronics, because less energy is needed to flip spin states than to flip switches to create voltage barriers. Theoretical work hints that spin-polarized electrons from a ferromagnetic electrode can be controlled by a change in polarization created in a ferroelectric thin film. Garcia et al. (p. 1106 , published online 14 January) fabricated an iron-barium titanate junction on a lanthanum strontium manganate substrate that acts as a spin detector. Local control of spin polarization was observed in the ferroelectric layer, which retained its polarization without any applied power."
https://openalex.org/W2039731535,"All immune systems must distinguish self from non-self to repel invaders without inducing autoimmunity. Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci protect bacteria and archaea from invasion by phage and plasmid DNA through a genetic interference pathway. CRISPR loci are present in approximately 40% and approximately 90% of sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes, respectively, and evolve rapidly, acquiring new spacer sequences to adapt to highly dynamic viral populations. Immunity requires a sequence match between the invasive DNA and the spacers that lie between CRISPR repeats. Each cluster is genetically linked to a subset of the cas (CRISPR-associated) genes that collectively encode >40 families of proteins involved in adaptation and interference. CRISPR loci encode small CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that contain a full spacer flanked by partial repeat sequences. CrRNA spacers are thought to identify targets by direct Watson-Crick pairing with invasive 'protospacer' DNA, but how they avoid targeting the spacer DNA within the encoding CRISPR locus itself is unknown. Here we have defined the mechanism of CRISPR self/non-self discrimination. In Staphylococcus epidermidis, target/crRNA mismatches at specific positions outside of the spacer sequence license foreign DNA for interference, whereas extended pairing between crRNA and CRISPR DNA repeats prevents autoimmunity. Hence, this CRISPR system uses the base-pairing potential of crRNAs not only to specify a target, but also to spare the bacterial chromosome from interference. Differential complementarity outside of the spacer sequence is a built-in feature of all CRISPR systems, indicating that this mechanism is a broadly applicable solution to the self/non-self dilemma that confronts all immune pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2119893163,"We report that eight heterozygous missense mutations in TUBB3, encoding the neuron-specific beta-tubulin isotype III, result in a spectrum of human nervous system disorders that we now call the TUBB3 syndromes. Each mutation causes the ocular motility disorder CFEOM3, whereas some also result in intellectual and behavioral impairments, facial paralysis, and/or later-onset axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Neuroimaging reveals a spectrum of abnormalities including hypoplasia of oculomotor nerves and dysgenesis of the corpus callosum, anterior commissure, and corticospinal tracts. A knock-in disease mouse model reveals axon guidance defects without evidence of cortical cell migration abnormalities. We show that the disease-associated mutations can impair tubulin heterodimer formation in vitro, although folded mutant heterodimers can still polymerize into microtubules. Modeling each mutation in yeast tubulin demonstrates that all alter dynamic instability whereas a subset disrupts the interaction of microtubules with kinesin motors. These findings demonstrate that normal TUBB3 is required for axon guidance and maintenance in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2038068904,"Background The functional architecture of the human brain has been extensively described in terms of functional connectivity networks, detected from the low–frequency coherent neuronal fluctuations that can be observed in a resting state condition. Little is known, so far, about the changes in functional connectivity and in the topological properties of functional networks, associated with different brain diseases. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we investigated alterations related to mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE), using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging on 18 mTLE patients and 27 healthy controls. Functional connectivity among 90 cortical and subcortical regions was measured by temporal correlation. The related values were analyzed to construct a set of undirected graphs. Compared to controls, mTLE patients showed significantly increased connectivity within the medial temporal lobes, but also significantly decreased connectivity within the frontal and parietal lobes, and between frontal and parietal lobes. Our findings demonstrated that a large number of areas in the default-mode network of mTLE patients showed a significantly decreased number of connections to other regions. Furthermore, we observed altered small-world properties in patients, along with smaller degree of connectivity, increased n-to-1 connectivity, smaller absolute clustering coefficients and shorter absolute path length. Conclusions/Significance We suggest that the mTLE alterations observed in functional connectivity and topological properties may be used to define tentative disease markers."
https://openalex.org/W2024754608,"The human Y chromosome began to evolve from an autosome hundreds of millions of years ago, acquiring a sex-determining function and undergoing a series of inversions that suppressed crossing over with the X chromosome. Little is known about the recent evolution of the Y chromosome because only the human Y chromosome has been fully sequenced. Prevailing theories hold that Y chromosomes evolve by gene loss, the pace of which slows over time, eventually leading to a paucity of genes, and stasis. These theories have been buttressed by partial sequence data from newly emergent plant and animal Y chromosomes, but they have not been tested in older, highly evolved Y chromosomes such as that of humans. Here we finished sequencing of the male-specific region of the Y chromosome (MSY) in our closest living relative, the chimpanzee, achieving levels of accuracy and completion previously reached for the human MSY. By comparing the MSYs of the two species we show that they differ radically in sequence structure and gene content, indicating rapid evolution during the past 6 million years. The chimpanzee MSY contains twice as many massive palindromes as the human MSY, yet it has lost large fractions of the MSY protein-coding genes and gene families present in the last common ancestor. We suggest that the extraordinary divergence of the chimpanzee and human MSYs was driven by four synergistic factors: the prominent role of the MSY in sperm production, 'genetic hitchhiking' effects in the absence of meiotic crossing over, frequent ectopic recombination within the MSY, and species differences in mating behaviour. Although genetic decay may be the principal dynamic in the evolution of newly emergent Y chromosomes, wholesale renovation is the paramount theme in the continuing evolution of chimpanzee, human and perhaps other older MSYs."
https://openalex.org/W2168132477,"Over 1 billion people are estimated to be overweight, placing them at risk for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. We performed a systems-level genetic dissection of adiposity regulation using genome-wide RNAi screening in adult Drosophila. As a follow-up, the resulting ∼500 candidate obesity genes were functionally classified using muscle-, oenocyte-, fat-body-, and neuronal-specific knockdown in vivo and revealed hedgehog signaling as the top-scoring fat-body-specific pathway. To extrapolate these findings into mammals, we generated fat-specific hedgehog-activation mutant mice. Intriguingly, these mice displayed near total loss of white, but not brown, fat compartments. Mechanistically, activation of hedgehog signaling irreversibly blocked differentiation of white adipocytes through direct, coordinate modulation of early adipogenic factors. These findings identify a role for hedgehog signaling in white/brown adipocyte determination and link in vivo RNAi-based scanning of the Drosophila genome to regulation of adipocyte cell fate in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2115655607,"Targeting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein is a promising strategy for cancer therapy. The mTOR kinase functions in two complexes, TORC1 (target of rapamycin complex-1) and TORC2 (target of rapamycin complex-2); however, neither of these complexes is fully inhibited by the allosteric inhibitor rapamycin or its analogs. We compared rapamycin with PP242, an inhibitor of the active site of mTOR in both TORC1 and TORC2 (hereafter referred to as TORC1/2), in models of acute leukemia harboring the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) translocation. We demonstrate that PP242, but not rapamycin, causes death of mouse and human leukemia cells. In vivo, PP242 delays leukemia onset and augments the effects of the current front-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors more effectively than does rapamycin. Unexpectedly, PP242 has much weaker effects than rapamycin on the proliferation and function of normal lymphocytes. PI-103, a less selective TORC1/2 inhibitor that also targets phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), is more immunosuppressive than PP242. These findings establish that Ph(+) transformed cells are more sensitive than normal lymphocytes to selective TORC1/2 inhibitors and support the development of such inhibitors for leukemia therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1981267808,"Episodic Rise Sea-level rise between the end of the Last Glacial Maximum and the beginning of the Holocene accelerated episodically, with the fastest rate occurring during meltwater pulse 1A (14,000 years ago) and perhaps during another interval called meltwater pulse 1B (11,300 years ago). However, existing records are not precise enough to confidently assess sea-level change during meltwater pulse 1B or the Younger Dryas cold event (12,900 to 11,600 years ago). Bard et al. (p. 1235 , published online 14 January) present data from three cores drilled in coral reefs in Tahiti that allow a better quantification of sea-level changes between 14,000 and 9000 years ago. No significant change in the rate of sea-level rise could be detected for the period previously identified as meltwater pulse 1B; reducing the likelihood that such an episode occurred. Furthermore, sea level rose more rapidly at the start of the Younger Dryas but slowed during the rest of the cold event. These findings have implications for our understanding of the dynamics of deglaciation."
https://openalex.org/W2053863057,"Recently, microRNAs have emerged as regulators of cancer metastasis through acting on multiple signaling pathways involved in metastasis. In this study, we have analyzed the level of miR-10b and cell motility and invasiveness in several human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. Our results reveal a significant correlation of miR-10b level with cell motility and invasiveness. Overexpression of miR-10b in KYSE140 cells increased cell motility and invasiveness, whereas inhibition of miR-10b in EC9706 cells reduced cell invasiveness, although it did not alter cell motility. Additionally, we identified KLF4, a known tumor suppressor gene that has been reported to suppress esophageal cancer cell migration and invasion, as a direct target of miR-10b. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-10b in KYSE140 and KYSE450 cells led to a reduction of endogenous KLF4 protein, whereas silencing of miR-10b in EC9706 cells caused up-regulation of KLF4 protein. Coexpression of miR-10b and KLF4 in KYSE140 cells and coexpression of small interfering RNA for KLF4 mRNA and miR-10b-AS in EC9706 cells partially abrogated the effect of miR-10b on cell migration and invasion. Finally, analyses of the miR-10b level in 40 human esophageal cancer samples and their paired normal adjacent tissues revealed an elevated expression of miR-10b in 95% (38 of 40) of cancer tissues, although no significant correlation of the miR-10b level with clinical metastasis status was observed in these samples.

For invasion assay, 1.5 × 105 KYSE140 cells and 1 × 105 EC9706 cells were plated on chambers precoated with 20 μg of Matrigel. In both assays, the cells were plated in medium without serum, and medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the lower chamber served as chemoattractant. After 18 or 24 h, the cells that did not migrate or invade through the pores were removed by cotton swabs. The inserts were fixed and stained, and three random fields for each insert were counted. The results were averaged among three independent experiments. The cells of 90% confluence in 96-well plates were transiently transfected with firefly luciferase reporter gene constructs and miR-10b-expressing plasmid. After 48 h, luciferase activity was measured using a dual luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI), normalized for transfection efficiency by cotransfecting with 0.5 ng of pRL-SV40 Renilla. For each plasmid construct, three independent transfection experiments were performed in triplicate. Western blots were performed as previously described (37.Zhang L. Ding F. Cao W. Liu Z. Liu W. Yu Z. Wu Y. Li W. Li Y. Liu Z. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 1639-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Protein bands were detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL system (Vigorous Biotech, Beijing, China) according to the manufacture's protocol. The intensity of the bands was quantified by densitometry. KYSE140 cells of 90% confluence were transfected with pcDNA3.0-miR-10b and control plasmid. 48 h later, the cells were treated with 100 μg/ml cyclohexamide. At the indicated time points, the cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blot with KLF4 and control β-actin antibodies. The band intensities were quantified by densitometry, and the resulting KLF4/β-actin ratios were plotted in a nonlinear regression plot. Statistical analysis was performed on SPSS13.0. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to examine the correlation between miR-10b and migration and invasion potential and the correlation between miR-10b and KLF4 protein levels of human ESCC cell lines. Differences between two groups were explored by Student's t test. For comparison of paired tissues, paired Student's t test was used to determine the statistical significance. The values were presented as the means ± S.D. A p value of <0.01 was considered to be statistically significant, which is labeled with an asterisk in the figures. Real time RT-PCR (quantitative PCR) analysis of eight human ESCC cell lines revealed that miR-10b levels varied considerably among the cell lines (Fig. 1A). The highest expression level of miR-10b was observed in EC9706 cells, which was ∼70-fold higher than that in KYSE70, KYSE140, and KYSE150 cells. To test the correlation between the miR-10b level and migration and invasion potential in human ESCC cell lines, we performed Transwell assays on the ESCC cell lines (Fig. 1B). In the KYSE series, statistically significant correlations of the miR-10b level with both cell migration and invasion potential were observed (r = 0.74 and 0.76, respectively, with a p value of <0.05). Taking into account the EC9706 cell line, highly significant correlations were found between miR-10b and cell migration and invasion potential (r = 0.98 and 0.97, respectively, with a p value of <0.001). These results suggested a causal role for miR-10b in the migration and invasion of human ESCC cell lines. miR-10b is closely related to miR-10a, which differs from miR-10b by a single nucleotide (Fig. 2A). To rule out potential cross-reactivity of miR-10a, we overexpressed miR-10b in KYSE140 cells. Total RNA was converted to cDNA using a looped RT primer (Fig. 2A). Mature miR-10b and miR-10a were measured by real time PCR using miRNA-specific primers (Fig. 2A). The results showed that the miR-10b level was dramatically elevated (>1000-fold), whereas the increase of miR-10a was elevated much less (Fig. 2B). Transfection of the antisense inhibitor miR-10b-AS into EC9706 significantly reduced the level of miR-10b but not that of miR-10a (Fig. 2C), indicating that miR-10b PCR primers were relatively specific, exhibiting weak cross-reactivity with cDNA reverted from mature miR-10a. To determine whether miR-10b regulates human ESCC cell migration and invasion, we selected EC9706 cells, which show strong migration and invasion potential, and KYSE140 cells, which show weak migration and invasion potential, for further study. We first performed loss-of-function analysis by silencing miR-10b with miR-10b-AS in EC9706 cells. Inhibition of miR-10b in EC9706 cells led to a 73% reduction in invasion assay compared with control cells, whereas no change was observed in the migration potential (Fig. 2, D and E). We then transfected pcDNA-3.0-miR-10b into KYSE140 cells, and a 2-fold increase in cell migration as well as invasion potential was observed (Fig. 2, F and G). In addition, overexpression of miR-10b had no effect on cell proliferation in KYSE140 cells (data not shown). These observations indicated a positive role for miR-10b in migration and invasion of human ESCC cell lines. To explore the molecular mechanism of miR-10b function, we used TargetScan4.0 to predict targets of miR-10b in human. Several genes, which have been reported to suppress cell migration or invasion, were selected for further analysis. Among them, KLF4 was of particular interest, because it was found to be down-regulated in human esophageal cancer (22.Ohnishi S. Ohnami S. Laub F. Aoki K. Suzuki K. Kanai Y. Haga K. Asaka M.

Goldstein B.G. Chao H.H. Katz J.P. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2005; 4: 1216-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3A, there was a miR-10b binding site at nucleotides 295–301 of the KLF4 3′-UTR. Comparing the human sequence for interspecies homology, we found that the miR-10b target sequence at nucleotides 295–301 of the KLF4 3′-UTR is highly conserved among different species (Fig. 3A). To determine whether KLF4 is a direct target of miR-10b, we constructed pIS0-KLF4-3′-UTR and pIS0-KLF4-3′-UTR-mut (Fig. 3B). Cotransfection of KYSE140 cells with pIS0-KLF4–3′-UTR and pcDNA3.0-miR-10b caused a 30% decrease in the luciferase activity compared with the negative control. This suppression was rescued by the four-nucleotide substitution in the core binding sites (Fig. 3C). The similar effect was also found in KYSE450 cells (Fig. 3C). To test whether miR-10b expression affected endogenous KLF4 expression, we transfected pcDNA3.0- miR-10b and control plasmid into KYSE140 and KYSE450 cells; a decrease of KLF4 protein level in KYSE140 and KYSE450 cells was observed. Consistent with these results, silencing of miR-10b in EC9706 cells showed an increase in the KLF4 protein level (Fig. 4A). Meanwhile we found that HOXD10 was also regulated by miR-10b in these three cell lines, with a corresponding change of RHOC level (Fig. 4A). Real time quantitative PCR of KLF4 mRNA showed that miR-10b overexpression or inhibition had no effect on KLF4 mRNA level (Fig. 4B), which indicated the post-transcriptional regulation of miR-10b on KLF4 mRNA. We then examined the KLF4 protein levels in eight ESCC cell lines (Fig. 4C) and compared them with miR-10b levels, but no significant correlation was found between the KLF4 protein levels and the miR-10b levels. KLF4 is an unstable protein, and ubiquitin-mediated proteasome is involved in its degradation. When new protein synthesis was blocked, KLF4 underwent rapid turnover and exhibited a relatively short half-life of 2 h (40.Chen Z.Y. Wang X. Zhou Y. Offner G. Tseng C.C. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10394-10400Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To rule out any effect of miR-10b on KLF4 protein stability, the half-life of KLF4 was measured. KYSE140 cells transfected with miR-10b-expressing plasmid were treated with cyclohexamide to halt new protein synthesis. At the indicated time points, the cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 4D). Analysis of KLF4/β-actin ratios by regression plot showed that the half-life of KLF4 in miR-10b overexpressing cells was comparable with control cells (Fig. 4E). Therefore, miR-10b does not change the rate of KLF4 protein degradation. The decreased KLF4 expression in miR-10b overexpressing cells was due to the post-transcriptional regulation of miR-10b. Next, we investigated whether KLF4 suppressed cell migration and invasion in KYSE140 and EC9706 cells. KLF4 has been reported to suppress metastasis of several cancers including esophageal cancer cells (28.Yang Y. Goldstein B.G. Chao H.H. Katz J.P. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2005; 4: 1216-1621Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5 (A and B), silencing of KLF4 by siRNA in KYSE140 cells led to increased cell migration and invasiveness, whereas overexpression of KLF4 in EC9706 cells resulted in a decrease in cell migration and invasion, demonstrating a negative role for KLF4 protein in the migration and invasion in human ESCC cells. To further establish a functional connection between miR-10b and KLF4, we tested whether KLF4 deregulation was required for regulation of miR-10b on cell migration and invasion. pcDNA3.1-KLF4, which carried the whole KLF4 coding sequence without 3′-UTR, and pcDNA3.0-miR-10b were cotransfected into KYSE140 cells. Interestingly, we found that expression of KLF4 partly abrogated migration and invasion initiated by miR-10b in KYSE140 cells (Fig. 5C). To further test this, we cotransfected EC9706 cells with siRNA for KLF4 mRNA and miR-10b-AS and found that the effect of miR-10b-AS was partially attenuated by siRNA for KLF4 mRNA (Fig. 5D). These results indicate that KLF4 serves as a target of miR-10b, contributing to the effect of miR-10b on cell migration and invasion. In parallel, the KLF4 protein level of both experiments was analyzed by Western blot. Finally, we studied whether the expression level of miR-10b in vivo was associated with the metastasis outcome in human ESCC patients. We measured the miR-10b level in 40 tumor specimens and their paired normal adjacent tissues. Among these tissues, 20 pairs were node-positive, and the others were node-negative, which was verified by pathological analysis. As shown in Fig. 6, an elevated miR-10b level was detected in 95% (38 of 40) of the tumor tissues compared with their corresponding normal tissues, with a mean fold of 3.39. The elevation of miR-10b levels in cancer tissues was highly significant with a p value of <0.001, indicating the important role of miR-10b in human ESCC. However, Student's t test, used to examine the difference of miR-10b level between node-positive and node-negative tissues, yielded no significant correlation of miR-10b levels with clinical metastasis status, with a p value of 0.242. miRNAs, a class of small noncoding RNAs, have emerged as important regulators of protein post-transcriptional regulation. Increased numbers of reports reveal the aberrant expression of several miRNAs in tumors with a correlation with certain oncogenes or tumor suppressors or in response to chemotherapy or radiation (9.Calin G.A.

These transient attacks resemble those of patients with familial hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoKPP) and resolve with treatment of the underlying hyperthyroidism. Because of the phenotypic similarity of these conditions, we hypothesized that TPP might also be a channelopathy. While sequencing candidate genes, we identified a previously unreported gene (not present in human sequence databases) that encodes an inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channel, Kir2.6. This channel, nearly identical to Kir2.2, is expressed in skeletal muscle and is transcriptionally regulated by thyroid hormone. Expression of Kir2.6 in mammalian cells revealed normal Kir currents in whole-cell and single-channel recordings. Kir2.6 mutations were present in up to 33% of the unrelated TPP patients in our collection. Some of these mutations clearly alter a variety of Kir2.6 properties, all altering muscle membrane excitability leading to paralysis.

KCNJ18 mutations are associated with thyrotoxic hypokalemic periodic paralysis, TPP KCNJ18 encodes an inward rectifying potassium channel, Kir 2.6 Thyroid hormones regulate KCNJ18 both transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally The periodic paralyses and nondystrophic myotonias comprise a group of muscle disorders characterized by abnormal muscle relaxation (myotonia) and/or paroxysmal muscle weakness. These disorders are subdivided on the basis of the presence of myotonia with weakness, response to potassium, temperature sensitivity, association with cardiac arrhythmia and facial dysmorphology, and induction by thyrotoxicosis. Many of these entities are now known to result from ion channel mutations, termed channelopathies (Ryan and Ptácek, 2007Ryan D.P. Ptácek L.J. Ion channel disorders.in: Rosenberg R.N. DiMauro S. Paulson H.L. Ptácek L.J. Nestler E.J. The Molecular and Genetic Basis of Neurologic and Psychiatric Disease. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia2007: 550-568Google Scholar). TPP is a sporadic muscle disorder characterized by episodic attacks of weakness and hypokalemia in some thyrotoxic individuals. Patients are normal between attacks, which resolve with treatment of thyrotoxicosis. Episodic weakness in TPP is clinically similar to the known channelopathies familial hypoKPP and Andersen-Tawil syndrome (ATS) (Bulman et al., 1999Bulman D.E. Scoggan K.A. van Oene M.D. Nicolle M.W.

Metabol. 2004; 48: 196-215PubMed Google Scholar). In these populations, up to 10% of thyrotoxic male individuals develop episodic weakness. In Caucasians, this number is less than 0.1% (Kelley et al., 1989Kelley D.E. Gharib H. Kennedy F.P. Duda Jr., R.J. McManis P.G. Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis. Report of 10 cases and review of electromyographic findings.Arch. Intern. Med. 1989; 149: 2597-2600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although thyrotoxicosis is more common in women, most individuals with TPP are men. Aside from similarity to the familial periodic paralyses, several observations indicate that TPP may be a genetically conditioned disorder unmasked by thyrotoxicosis. Although weakness is a common symptom of thyrotoxicosis, episodic flaccid paralysis arises in only some thyrotoxic patients. TPP recurs in patients with recurring hyperthyroidism, such as relapses of Graves Disease (Kung, 2002Kung A.W. Thyrotoxic Periodic Paralysis.in: Wass J.A.H. Shalet S.M. Gale E.A.M. Oxford Textbook of Endocrinology and Diabetes. Oxford University Press, Oxford2002: 427-429Google Scholar), and, as with other channelopathies, a similar phenotype is seen across species (Nemzek et al., 1994Nemzek J.A. Kruger J.M. Walshaw R. Hauptman J.G. Acute onset of hypokalemia and muscular weakness in four hyperthyroid cats.J. Am. Vet. Med. Assoc. 1994; 205: 65-68PubMed Google Scholar). While screening skeletal muscle ion channel candidate genes in TPP patients, we serendipitously identified a previously unreported gene—here named KCNJ18—encoding an inwardly rectifying potassium channel, Kir2.6. This subfamily, which includes Kir2.1 through Kir2.4 and Kir2.2v/Kir2.5, is one of seven subfamilies (Kir1.x to Kir7.x). Kir subunits have two membrane-spanning domains, are selective for potassium, stabilize the resting membrane potential near the potassium equilibrium potential, and tetramerize to form functional, inwardly rectifying channels (Krapivinsky et al., 1998Krapivinsky G.

Lopatin A.N. Inward rectifier potassium channels.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). The structural and functional homology of these channels suggests they arose through gene duplication with subsequent diversification. This process plays a crucial role in evolution, allowing redundant gene variants to acquire novel characteristics and functions, with a likely role in expanding protein diversity. Kir channels have assumed specific functions in excitable tissues and mutations in these channels can cause human disease. Kir channelopathies include the episodic muscle and developmental features of ATS (Kir2.1), the renal tubular secretion defects seen with Barter syndrome type III (Kir1.1), and defective insulin secretion in persistent hyperinsulinemic hyperglycemia of infancy (Kir6.2) (Abraham et al., 1999Abraham M.R.

Kir2.6 shares 99% identity with Kir2.2 and was considered an excellent candidate for TPP because it is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle and probably contributes to cell membrane excitability. Furthermore, KCNJ18 has a thyroid hormone response cis element (TRE) within its promoter, which might drive increased expression of Kir2.6 to protect against membrane potential instability. Genetic analysis revealed mutations in Kir2.6 in multiple TPP patients. Electrophysiological analysis indicates that some of these mutations have large effects on Kir2.6 currents either inherently or via thyroid hormone-inducible mechanisms. As such, mutations may cause predisposition for the episodic weakness seen only during thyrotoxicosis. Since ion channel mutations cause familial periodic paralysis, we screened ion channels known to be expressed in skeletal muscle with putative thyroid response elements (TREs) of the DR-4 motif in their promoter regions, for mutations (Table S1 available online). While screening KCNJ12, we noted a number of polymorphisms that violated Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, suggesting the existence of another gene. By changing PCR methods and primers, we specifically amplified a highly homologous sequence that we have submitted under NCBI accession number FJ434338 as KCNJ18. Sequencing of ten clones from low-stringency PCR yielded the known genes KCNJ12 (Kir2.2) and KCNJN1/KCNJ17 (Kir2.2v/Kir2.5). In addition, a previously unreported paralog KCNJ18 (Kir2.6, Figure 1) was seen, which shares 98%–99% identity in the coding region (96%–99% at the amino acid level, depending on the SNPs present in KCNJ18) with KCNJ12 (Tables S2 and S3), shares >95% identity with KCNJ17 (data not shown), and is only one amino acid different from KCNJ12X (AB181299). To verify that KCNJ18 is a paralogous locus, a human bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) DNA library was screened for KCNJ18 and KCNJ12 by PCR with gene-specific primers. Two nonoverlapping BAC clones contained either KCNJ18 (RP11-437N10) or KCNJ12 (RP11-728e14). A Southern blot performed on BamHI-digested RP11-437N10 yielded a 2.6 Kb fragment (Figure 2B). Furthermore, we are unable to specifically amplify KCNJ12 from RP11-437N10, but are able to do so from RP11-728e14, as confirmed by sequencing of the PCR product. The reverse is true for specific amplification of KCNJ18 (Figure 2C). It appears that during the analysis and alignment of genome sequences, the high identity between KCNJ12 and KCNJ18 resulted in nonhomologous end joining of nonoverlapping BACs and, therefore, exclusion of KCNJ18. Based on sequencing of both ends of RP11-437N10, we locate this BAC centromeric to KCNJ12 in the same chromosomal segment, where there is currently a gap (Figure 2D). Taken together, these data suggest that the two homologs arose through duplication of this region (Figure S2).Figure S2KCNJ18 and KCNJ12 Are Unique—Related to Figure 2Show full captionAlignment of the BACs containing KCNJ12 (RP11-728E14) and KCNJ18 (RP11-437N10) suggests that KCNJ18 is largely a duplication of KCNJ12 (A, diagram as in Figure 1 where dashed lines indicate duplication boundaries and arrows primer position). The duplication/unique region boundary can be specifically amplified from each BAC using a specific forward primer (111F: CCCAATCAAGCAGAAACACA or 112F: CCTGCTAGATCCCAGCTCAG) and a non-specific reverse primer (111R; GGAGAAACCGGAGAAACACA), indicating that the BACs are unique (B). Both primer pairs are also able to produce different PCR products from human genomic DNA (hG).

The flanking 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of KCNJ12 and KCNJ18 were characterized by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), using the unique nucleotides at the 3′ end of the primers from the coding sequence as the gene-specific primers. Despite the high homology, unique upstream sequences were noted in RACE clones in the 5′ UTR. Sequencing of the BACs revealed a unique exon 1 for each gene. We obtained the Kir2.6 cDNA from a human testis cDNA pool using specific outer primers designed from the RACE clone sequences. The forward primer was taken from the unique exon 1 sequence and the reverse from the 3′ UTR. Each of the DNA sequence variants found in the KCNJ18 BAC clone that differ from KCNJ12 are also present in the full-length KCNJ18 cDNA, establishing it as an independent transcript. This transcript was also amplified from pooled human brain and skeletal muscle cDNA. For both genes, exon 3 contains the entire coding region, (Figure 1A). Probes for the unique exon 1 of KCNJ12 and KCNJ18 were used for northern blot analysis. Both transcripts are highly expressed in skeletal muscle (Figures 3A–3C) and the transcript sizes differ (∼2.2 Kb for KCNJ12, ∼6 Kb for KCNJ18). We tested whether KCNJ18 transcription is regulated by triiodothyronine (T3) since there is a putative TRE (in reverse strand) between nucleotides −265 and −249 (5′-TGACCTGGCCTcACCTCAGGG-3′), which differs from the consensus TRE by only 1 base pair (c). This is a direct motif repeat with a 4 nt link (DR4). A luciferase assay in mammalian cells overexpressing thyroid hormone (TR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) was used to determine whether this TRE motif is functional. Mouse skeletal muscle myoblasts (C2C12) or human embryonic kidney cells (293T) were transfected with reporter constructs containing the KCNJ18/TRE-pGL3 wild-type (WT), negative controls consisting of mutant (Mut) or empty pGL3 vector (Emp), and positive control (2xDR4-pGL3). The WT construct produced high luciferase activity compared to controls and responded in a dose-dependent fashion to T3. However, the truncated Mut construct produced only 25% and 7% as much luciferase activity as WT in 293T and C2C12 cells, respectively (Figure 3D). These results corroborate our data from an electrophoretic mobility shift assay with nuclear extracts from a pool of TR-transfected 293T cells (data not shown). The KCNJ18 coding region was specifically amplified and sequenced in 30 TPP patients collected from the United States, Brazil, and France. Five mutations were found. Two C-to-T transitions, c.C1195T (R399X) and c.C1219T (Q407X), were identified in one and five affected individuals, respectively. Missense mutations c.C1061T (T354M) and c.A1097G (K366R) were identified in a single patient each. Two further patients, both from France, presented with both a T140M mutation and a single nucleotide deletion (c.428 delC) leading to a frameshift with a stop codon at position 151 (I144fs). The T140M mutation appears alongside the I144fs mutation, which is the likely causative change. These mutated residues are well conserved in Kir2 channels (Figure S1). None were found in 281 healthy controls (137 Caucasians, 48 Mexicans, 45 African Americans, 43 Chinese, and eight Japanese-Brazilians). Since TPP is highly prevalent in Asian thyrotoxic patients, we sequenced KCNJ18 in TPP patients from Hong Kong, Thailand, and Singapore. One of 83 TPP subjects from Hong Kong harbored a mutation (R205H), none of 31 Thai subjects harbored mutations, and seven of 27 Singaporean subjects harbored mutations (all R399X). R399X was found in one of 76 Singaporean control samples, as expected from the prevalence of TPP among thyrotoxic individuals. No mutations were found in 98 Hong Kong thyrotoxic controls not manifesting TPP. Results are summarized in Table S4, and the mutation positions within Kir2.6 are indicated in Figure 1C. Kir2.6 channels were fused to EGFP (N-terminal for the mutant and both C-terminal and N-terminal for the WT) and expressed in 293T cells. Whole-cell recordings of WT-expressing cells indicate that Kir2.6 produces typical inwardly rectifying currents (Figure 4A). This inward rectification is vital for the proper function of skeletal muscle as it allows potassium current around the resting membrane potential but not during action potentials. Normalization of currents to that produced at −60 mV allows comparison of rectification, which is unaffected by any of the TPP mutations (Figure 4B). Some of the mutations alter current density (Figures 4C and 4D). The I144fs mutation results in a complete loss of current while the T354M mutation causes a small decrease in current density. Cotransfection of the I144fs mutation with WT channels (fused to the C terminus of EYFP) indicates that I144fs does not exert a dominant negative effect (Figure S3).Figure S3The I144fs Mutation Does Not Act in a Dominant Negative Manner—Related to Figure 4Show full captionWild-type (black squares) channels were expressed in HEK293 cells at half their normal levels with or without an equivalent amount of I144fs mutant (red circles for WT + I144fs).

Kir2.2 has a single-channel conductance of 30–34 pS and a high open probability (Po) (Preisig-Müller et al., 2002Preisig-Müller R. Schlichthörl G. Goerge T. Heinen S. Brüggemann A. Rajan S. Derst C.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23274-23279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kir2.6 has identical single-channel characteristics, with a conductance of approximately 34 pS and a Po of ∼80% (Figures 5A–5C). PKC activation, which is increased during thyrotoxicosis, results in decreased Kir2.2 whole-cell currents, and threonine 354 is involved in this process (Karle et al., 2002Karle C.A. Zitron E. Zhang W. Wendt-Nordahl G. Kathöfer S. Thomas D. Gut B. Scholz E. Vahl C.F. Katus H.A. Kiehn J.

As the equivalent Kir2.6 residue is mutated in one TPP patient, we tested whether phosphorylation of this residue alters single-channel characteristics and whether the T354M mutation abrogates these alterations. The single-channel conductance and Po of the T354M mutant are identical to WT Kir2.6 channels (Figures 5B and 5C). Activation of PKC with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) does not seem to alter the single-channel conductance of either the mutant T354M (35.7 ± 0.85 pS with PMA versus 33.8 ± 0.89 pS without) or WT channels (32.8 ± 3.0 pS with PMA versus 34.2 ± 0.9 pS without, Figure 5B). However, while PKC activation does not alter the Po of mutant channels, it nearly abolishes that of WT channels (WT, 78.9% ± 0.9%; WT + PMA, 0.00069% ± 0.00033%; T354M, 82.1% ± 0.8%; T354M + PMA, 84.2% ± 0.8% average across voltages, Figure 5C). Similarly, mimicking pseudoconstitutive phosphorylation of this residue (T354E) results in unaltered single-channel conductance (30.5 ± 0.17 pS) and a decreased Po (0.00093% ± 0.00048%). Kir channel interactions with phosphatidylinositol-(4,5) bisphosphate (PIP2) occur via positively charged residues in the C termini and are required for the opening of mammalian Kir channels. Mutation of such residues in Kir2.1 leads to ATS (Donaldson et al., 2003Donaldson M.R. Jensen J.L. Tristani-Firouzi M. Tawil R. Bendahhou S. Suarez W.A. Cobo A.M. Poza J.J. Behr E. Wagstaff J. et al.PIP2 binding residues of Kir2.1 are common targets of mutations causing Andersen syndrome.Neurology. 2003; 60: 1811-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). PIP2 turnover is increased during thyrotoxicosis, and we hypothesized that the R205H and K366R mutations may alter interactions with PIP2 (Kavok et al., 2001Kavok N.S. Krasilnikova O.A. Babenko N.A. Thyroxine signal transduction in liver cells involves phospholipase C and phospholipase D activation. Genomic independent action of thyroid hormone.BMC Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We artificially decreased the availability of membrane PIP2 with polylysine and measured the time for channel openings to decrease, as measured by the T50 time constant. Both the R205H and K366R mutations cause an ∼1.5-fold increase in T50, (WT, T50 38.98 ± 0.016 s, base 0.85 ± 5.08e-4, A 7.82 ± 1.68e-3; R205H, T50 55.34 ± 0.016 s, base 0 ± 3.78e−4, A 6.0 ± 7.88e−4; K366R, T50 58.47 ± 0.024 s, base 1.02 ± 8.13e-4, A 8.92 ± 1.56e-3; Figures 6A–6D, p < 0.001 according to Figure S4). This increase in T50 indicates that mutant channels may produce more current than WT channels during thyrotoxicosis when PIP2 turnover is increased.Figure S4Statistical Modeling of Ion Channel PIP2 Interactions Indicates Robustness of T50 Estimations—Related to Figure 6Show full captionIndividual idealized ion channel open and closed states were simulated in accordance to fit parameters from Figure 6.

We have identified KCNJ18 as a paralog of KCNJ12 sharing up to 99% identity in coding sequence and having largely similar UTR and intron sequences. Because of this remarkable similarity, amplification of KCNJ12 for sequencing inadvertently amplified KCNJ18; sequence differences were previously interpreted as heterozygosity for polymorphic alleles for a single gene (KCNJ12), though we now present evidence for two unique genes. Duplicated regions are enriched in or around sequence gaps, such as that containing KCNJ18, and are known to be difficult to recognize (Bailey et al., 2001Bailey J.A. Yavor A"
https://openalex.org/W2000764314,"Background Leukocyte telomere length, an emerging marker of biological age, has been shown to predict cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, the natural history of telomere length in patients with coronary artery disease has not been studied. We sought to investigate the longitudinal trajectory of telomere length, and to identify the independent predictors of telomere shortening, in persons with coronary artery disease. Methodology/Principal Findings In a prospective cohort study of 608 individuals with stable coronary artery disease, we measured leukocyte telomere length at baseline, and again after five years of follow-up. We used multivariable linear and logistic regression models to identify the independent predictors of leukocyte telomere trajectory. Baseline and follow-up telomere lengths were normally distributed. Mean telomere length decreased by 42 base pairs per year (p<0.001). Three distinct telomere trajectories were observed: shortening in 45%, maintenance in 32%, and lengthening in 23% of participants. The most powerful predictor of telomere shortening was baseline telomere length (OR per SD increase = 7.6; 95% CI 5.5, 10.6). Other independent predictors of telomere shortening were age (OR per 10 years = 1.6; 95% CI 1.3, 2.1), male sex (OR = 2.4; 95% CI 1.3, 4.7), and waist-to-hip ratio (OR per 0.1 increase = 1.4; 95% CI 1.0, 2.0). Conclusions/Significance Leukocyte telomere length may increase as well as decrease in persons with coronary artery disease. Telomere length trajectory is powerfully influenced by baseline telomere length, possibly suggesting negative feedback regulation. Age, male sex, and abdominal obesity independently predict telomere shortening. The mechanisms and reversibility of telomeric aging in cardiovascular disease deserve further study."
https://openalex.org/W2085868655,"Sustained blood cell production depends on divisions by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that yield both differentiating progeny as well as new HSCs via self-renewal. Differentiating progeny remain capable of self-renewal, but only HSCs sustain self-renewal through successive divisions securely enough to maintain clones that persist life-long. Until recently, the first identified next stage consisted of ""short-term"" reconstituting cells able to sustain clones of differentiating cells for only 4-6 weeks. Here we expand evidence for a numerically dominant ""intermediate-term"" multipotent HSC stage in mice whose clones persist for 6-8 months before becoming extinct and that are separable from both short-term as well as permanently reconstituting ""long-term"" HSCs. The findings suggest that the first step in stem cell differentiation consists not in loss of initial capacity for serial self-renewal divisions, but rather in loss of mechanisms that stabilize self-renewing behavior throughout successive future stem cell divisions."
https://openalex.org/W2058021805,"Although mouse models have been valuable for studying human disease, the cellular and physiological differences between mouse and human have made it increasingly important to develop more relevant human disease models for mechanistic studies and drug discovery. Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), which can undergo unlimited self-renewal and retain the potential to differentiate into all cell types, present a possible solution. To improve the efficiency of genetic manipulation of hESCs, we have developed bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) based approach that enables high efficiency homologous recombination. By sequentially disrupting both alleles of ATM or p53 with BAC targeting vectors, we have established ATM(-/-) and p53(-/-) hESCs as models for two major human genetic instability syndromes and used the generated cells to reveal the importance of p53 in maintaining genome stability of hESCs. Our findings suggest that it will be feasible to develop genetically modified hESCs as relevant human disease models."
https://openalex.org/W1978203600,"The 70-kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp70) are chaperones with central roles in processes that involve polypeptide remodeling events. Hsp70 proteins consist of two major functional domains: an N-terminal nucleotide binding domain (NBD) with ATPase activity, and a C-terminal substrate binding domain (SBD). We present the first crystal structures of four human Hsp70 isoforms, those of the NBDs of HSPA1L, HSPA2, HSPA5 and HSPA6. As previously with Hsp70 family members, all four proteins crystallized in a closed cleft conformation, although a slight cleft opening through rotation of subdomain IIB was observed for the HSPA5-ADP complex. The structures presented here support the view that the NBDs of human Hsp70 function by conserved mechanisms and contribute little to isoform specificity, which instead is brought about by the SBDs and by accessory proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2166686108,"Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) rely on fibroblast growth factor and Activin-Nodal signaling to maintain their pluripotency. However, Activin-Nodal signaling is also known to induce mesendoderm differentiation. The mechanisms by which Activin-Nodal signaling can achieve these contradictory functions remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Smad-interacting protein 1 (SIP1) limits the mesendoderm-inducing effects of Activin-Nodal signaling without inhibiting the pluripotency-maintaining effects exerted by SMAD2/3. In turn, Activin-Nodal signaling cooperates with NANOG, OCT4, and SOX2 to control the expression of SIP1 in hESCs, thereby limiting the neuroectoderm-promoting effects of SIP1. Similar results were obtained with mouse epiblast stem cells, implying that these mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved and may operate in vivo during mammalian development. Overall, our results reveal the mechanisms by which Activin-Nodal signaling acts through SIP1 to regulate the cell-fate decision between neuroectoderm and mesendoderm in the progression from pluripotency to primary germ layer differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2072072113,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), which afflicts 1 in 3500 boys, is one of the most common genetic disorders of children. This fatal degenerative condition is caused by an absence or deficiency of dystrophin in striated muscle. Most affected patients have inherited or spontaneous deletions in the dystrophin gene that disrupt the reading frame resulting in unstable truncated products. For these patients, restoration of the reading frame via antisense oligonucleotide-mediated exon skipping is a promising therapeutic approach. The major DMD deletion ""hot spot"" is found between exons 45 and 53, and skipping exon 51 in particular is predicted to ameliorate the dystrophic phenotype in the greatest number of patients. Currently the mdx mouse is the most widely used animal model of DMD, although its mild phenotype limits its suitability in clinical trials. The Golden Retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) model has a severe phenotype, but due to its large size, is expensive to use. Both these models have mutations in regions of the dystrophin gene distant from the commonly mutated DMD ""hot spot"".Here we describe the severe phenotype, histopathological findings, and molecular analysis of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels with dystrophin-deficient muscular dystrophy (CKCS-MD). The dogs harbour a missense mutation in the 5' donor splice site of exon 50 that results in deletion of exon 50 in mRNA transcripts and a predicted premature truncation of the translated protein. Antisense oligonucleotide-mediated skipping of exon 51 in cultured myoblasts from an affected dog restored the reading frame and protein expression.Given the small size of the breed, the amiable temperament and the nature of the mutation, we propose that CKCS-MD is a valuable new model for clinical trials of antisense oligonucleotide-induced exon skipping and other therapeutic approaches for DMD."

In the present study, we utilized HDL as a multimodal nanoparticle platform for tumor targeting and imaging via nonspecific accumulation and specific binding to angiogenically activated blood vessels. We reconstituted HDL (rHDL) with amphiphilic gadolinium chelates and fluorescent dyes. To target angiogenic endothelial cells, rHDL was functionalized with alphavbeta3-integrin-specific RGD peptides (rHDL-RGD). Nonspecific RAD peptides were conjugated to rHDL nanoparticles as a control (rHDL-RAD). It was observed in vitro that all 3 nanoparticles were phagocytosed by macrophages, while alphavbeta3-integrin-specific rHDL-RGD nanoparticles were preferentially taken up by endothelial cells. The uptake of nanoparticles in mouse tumors was evaluated in vivo using near infrared (NIR) and MR imaging. All nanoparticles accumulated in tumors but with very different accumulation/binding kinetics as observed by NIR imaging. Moreover, confocal microscopy revealed rHDL-RGD to be associated with tumor endothelial cells, while rHDL and rHDL-RAD nanoparticles were mainly found in the interstitial space. This study demonstrates the ability to reroute HDL from its natural targets to tumor blood vessels and its potential for multimodal imaging of tumor-associated processes."
https://openalex.org/W2045378165,"Small non-coding RNAs (sRNA) have emerged as important elements of gene regulatory circuits. In enterobacteria such as Escherichia coli and Salmonella many of these sRNAs interact with the Hfq protein, an RNA chaperone similar to mammalian Sm-like proteins and act in the post-transcriptional regulation of many genes. A number of these highly conserved ribo-regulators are stringently regulated at the level of transcription and are part of major regulons that deal with the immediate response to various stress conditions, indicating that every major transcription factor may control the expression of at least one sRNA regulator. Here, we extend this view by the identification and characterization of a highly conserved, anaerobically induced small sRNA in E. coli, whose expression is strictly dependent on the anaerobic transcriptional fumarate and nitrate reductase regulator (FNR). The sRNA, named FnrS, possesses signatures of base-pairing RNAs, and we show by employing global proteomic and transcriptomic profiling that the expression of multiple genes is negatively regulated by the sRNA. Intriguingly, many of these genes encode enzymes with ""aerobic"" functions or enzymes linked to oxidative stress. Furthermore, in previous work most of the potential target genes have been shown to be repressed by FNR through an undetermined mechanism. Collectively, our results provide insight into the mechanism by which FNR negatively regulates genes such as sodA, sodB, cydDC, and metE, thereby demonstrating that adaptation to anaerobic growth involves the action of a small regulatory RNA."

Although acute phase SAA is predominantly expressed and produced by liver cells, there are growing numbers of reports describing its extrahepatic production by various tissues and cells. In humans, the expression and production of acute phase SAA have been found in several cell types within atherosclerotic lesions, including endothelial cells, macrophages, adipocytes, and smooth muscle cells (7.Meek R.L. Urieli-Shoval S. Benditt E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 3186-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) as well as in the epithelial cells of several normal tissues (8.Urieli-Shoval S. Cohen P. Eisenberg S. Matzner Y.J. J.

In addition to its well established acute response to inflammatory stimuli, an SAA response can also be observed in some chronic inflammatory conditions. Thus, SAA was found to be expressed in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease (9.Liang J.S. Sloane J.A. Wells J.M. Abraham C.R. Fine R.E. Sipe J.D. Neurosci. Lett. 1997; 225: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and in synovial fibroblasts of rheumatoid arthritis patients (10.Kumon Y. Suehiro T. Hashimoto K. Nakatani K. Sipe J.D. J. Rheumatol. 1999; 26: 785-790PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple clinical studies have demonstrated a significant association of altered SAA levels with several pathological states, particularly chronic inflammatory diseases such as secondary amyloidosis (11.Pepys M.B.

In vitro studies have suggested a number of pathways involving SAA in host defense mechanisms, inflammation, and atherogenesis. Lipid-poor SAA can act as a chemoattractant for inflammatory cells such as monocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and T-lymphocytes (22.Badolato R. Wang J.M. Murphy W.J. Lloyd A.R. Michiel D.F. Bausserman L.L. Kelvin D.J. Oppenheim J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 23.Xu L. Badolato R. Murphy W.J. Longo D.L. Anver M. Hale S. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1184-1190PubMed Google Scholar), all of which are involved in host defense mechanisms. It has been reported that SAA significantly stimulates the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines by cultured human neutrophils, lymphocytes (24.Furlaneto C.J. Campa A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 405-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), and THP-1 monocytic cells (5.Patel H. Fellowes R. Coade S. Woo P. Scand. J. Immunol. 1998; 48: 410-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). SAA can act as opsonin for Gram-negative bacteria, thereby enhancing bacterial phagocytosis as well as bacterium-stimulated cytokine release by peripheral blood mononuclear cell-derived macrophages (25.Shah C. Hari-Dass R. Raynes J.G. Blood. 2006; 108: 1751-1757Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). By displacing apoA-I from HDL (26.Husebekk A. Skogen B. Husby G. Scand. J. Immunol. 1987; 25: 375-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), lipoprotein-associated SAA may play a role in redirecting HDL to the sites of tissue destruction and cholesterol accumulation (27.Kisilevsky R. Subrahmanyan L. Lab. Invest. 1992; 66: 778-785PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, non-HDL-associated SAA promotes cholesterol efflux by both ABCA1-dependent and -independent mechanisms (28.Stonik J.A. Remaley A.T. Demosky S.J. Neufeld E.B. Bocharov A. Brewer H.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 321: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). SAA may also contribute to HDL-mediated clearance of cellular cholesterol by modulating lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity (29.Steinmetz A. Hocke G. Saïle R. Puchois P. Fruchart J.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1006: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) as well as by modulating cholesterol metabolism by serving as a cholesterol-binding protein (30.Liang J.S. Sipe J.D. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 37-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of SAA in various physiological and pathological processes has raised considerable interest in the identification of receptors that could potentially mediate binding/internalization and pro-inflammatory effects of SAA. Recent studies revealed several proteins that are capable of binding and/or mediating various SAA activities. FPRL1 (formyl peptide receptor like-1), a protein found in neutrophils, has been shown to mediate SAA-induced leukocyte chemotaxis (31.Su S.B. Gong W. Gao J.L. Shen W. Murphy P.M. Oppenheim J.J. Wang J.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) as well as release of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinase-9 from human leukocytes (32.Lee H.Y. Kim M.K. Park K.S. Bae Y.H. Yun J. Park J.I. Kwak J.Y. Bae Y.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The scavenger receptor SR-BI has been demonstrated to mediate the cholesterol efflux function of HDL-associated SAA (33.van der Westhuyzen D.R. Cai L. de Beer M.C. de Beer F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35890-35895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), whereas its human orthologue CLA-1 has been shown to internalize and mediate the pro-inflammatory activity of lipid-poor SAA via MAPK signaling pathways (34.Baranova I.N. Vishnyakova T.G. Bocharov A.V. Kurlander R. Chen Z. Kimelman M.L. Remaley A.T. Csako G. Thomas F. Eggerman T.L. Patterson A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8031-8040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Finally, recent experimental evidence suggests that toll-like receptors (TLRs) act as novel SAA receptors. TLR2 has been demonstrated to bind SAA and mediate SAA-stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages (35.Cheng N He R. Tian J. Ye P.P. Ye R.D. J. Immunol. 2008; 181: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), while functional TLR4 was shown to be required for SAA-induced NO production through the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPKs in murine peritoneal macrophages (36.Sandri S. Rodriguez D. Gomes E. Monteiro H.P. Russo M. Campa A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2008; 83: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Both TLRs and scavenger receptors are abundantly expressed in mononuclear phagocyte lineage cell types and play an essential role in innate immunity as pattern recognition receptors capable of recognizing a broad range of molecular patterns commonly found on pathogens. A widely accepted concept is that ligand binding to scavenger receptors leads to endocytosis and lysosomal degradation (37.Krieger M. Acton S. Ashkenas J. Pearson A. Penman M. Resnick D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4569-4572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Pearson A.M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), whereas engagement of TLRs transmits transmembrane signals to activate NF-κB and MAPK pathways (39.Muzio M. Natoli G. Saccani S. Levrero M. Mantovani A. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 2097-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 40.Faure E. Equils O. Sieling P.A. Thomas L. Zhang F.X. Kirschning C.J. Polentarutti N. Muzio M.

Signal. 2001; 13: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar). Microbial recognition, signaling, and modulation of TLR responses are known to require the presence of co-receptors/accessory molecules. By analogy with CD14 that is required for ligand recruitment to TLR4, recent findings demonstrated that scavenger receptor CD36 is an essential co-receptor involved in recognizing and presenting lipoteichoic acid and certain diacylglycerides to TLR2/6-mediated signaling pathways (42.Hoebe K. Georgel P. Rutschmann S. Du X. Mudd S. Crozat K. Sovath S. Shamel L. Hartung T. Zähringer U. Beutler B. Nature. 2005; 433: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 43.Triantafilou M.

At the same time, there is mounting evidence supporting an essential role of scavenger receptors as independent signaling molecules capable of activating signaling pathways upon ligand binding (44.Jiménez B. Volpert O.V. Reiher F. Chang L. Muñoz A. Karin M. Bouck N. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3443-3448Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 45.Moore K.J. El Khoury J. Medeiros L.A. Terada K. Geula C.

CD36 is an 88-kDa double-spanning plasma membrane glycoprotein and a member of the class B scavenger receptor family. As a pattern recognition receptor, CD36, by analogy with CLA-1/SR-BI, binds a broad variety of ligands, including native, oxidized, and acetylated low density lipoprotein (LDL) (47.Febbraio M.

J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1513-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Most recent studies implicated class B scavenger receptors, SR-BI and CD36, in recognizing ligands that trigger an innate immune response. In particular, these ligands include Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (53.Philips J.A. Rubin E.J. Perrimon N.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12623-12631Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The discovery of the multiple ligands shared by these two scavenger receptors along with the fact that SAA is also known to be an amphipathic protein with two amphipathic α-helical regions in the 1–18 N-terminal and 72–86 C-terminal sequences (3.Uhlar C.M. Whitehead A.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate the potential role of CD36 as an SAA receptor for both uptake and signaling. All media, serum preparations, cell trackers, reactive fluorescent dyes and antibiotics were obtained from Invitrogen. Recombinant synthetic human apo-SAA was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). The lipid content of the recombinant apo-SAA was analyzed by the phospholipids B enzymatic method (Wako, Richmond, VA), and the cholesterol content was determined by an enzymatic cholesterol method on a Cobas Fara II analyzer (Roche Applied Science). These assays indicated that the SAA preparation contained only small amounts of phospholipids (5 ng/μg) and cholesterol (<2 ng/μg) and hence was considered as a lipid-poor form of SAA throughout this study. The endotoxin level in both SAA and HDL preparations was less than 0.1 ng per μg (1 EU/μg). The anti-CD36 monoclonal antibody FA16 was purchased from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Anti-SAA polyclonal IgG was purified by affinity chromatography from a rabbit anti-recombinant human SAA serum obtained through Custom Polyclonal Antibody Service (Primm Biotech, Needham, MA). Synthetic amphipathic peptides were synthesized by a solid phase procedure (57.Merrifield R.B. JAMA. 1969; 210: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 58.Fairwell T. Hospattankar A.V.

Baranova I.N. Vishnyakova T.G. Remaley A.T. Csako G. Thomas F. Patterson A.P. Eggerman T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36072-36082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CD36-derived peptides were synthesized by the CBER/FDA Core Facility (Bethesda). Human HDL and LDL, as well as apolipoproteins A-I (apoA-I) and A-II (apoA-II), were purchased from EMD Biosciences (San Diego). Extensively oxidized LDL (oxLDL) was prepared by incubation with 5 μm CuSO4 at 37 °C for 24 h as described previously (60.Kunjathoor V.V. Febbraio M. Podrez E.A. Moore K.J. Andersson L. Koehn S.

The MAPK inhibitors PD98059, SB203580, SP600125 were purchased from EMD Biosciences. The NF-κB inhibitors, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and sulfasalasine, recombinant mouse macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, LPS from Salmonella enterica (serotype Minnesota), and Staphylococcus aureus LTA were purchased from Sigma. HeLa (Tet-Off) cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) using the expression plasmid pTRE2 (Clontech), encoding a human CD36 protein (pTRE2-CD36). Cells were co-transfected with pTRE2-hCD36 and pTK-Pur (Clontech), using a 1:20 ratio, and selected with 400 μg/ml puromycin. Puromycin-resistant cells were screened for the expression of the human CD36 protein utilizing mouse anti-hCD36 antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) in Western blotting. The HEK293 cell line was stably transfected with CD36 pIRES-hrGFP-2a plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) followed by selecting cells with the highest green fluorescent protein expression. HeLa (Tet-Off) cells (Clontech), hCD36-overexpressing HeLa cells, as well as the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 (ATCC, Manassas, VA), both wild type and CD36-overexpressing, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mm glutamine, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml G418 at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. THP-1 cells, a human monocyte cell line (ATCC), were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with the same additives as indicated above. Rat cd36-null (cd36−/−) and wild type (cd36+/+) macrophages were isolated from bone marrow cells of spontaneously hypertensive Wistar-Kioto male rats (SHR/NCrl) and its control strain Wistar-Kyoto/NCrl (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA), respectively. Initial breeding pairs of cd36−/− mice were generously provided by Dr. K. Moore (Harvard Medical School, Lipid Metabolism Unit). Mice used in these studies were propagated by homozygous mating colonies and maintained at the National Institutes of Health pathogen-free animal facility. Murine cd36−/− and cd36+/+ macrophages were isolated from bone marrow cells of CD36 null and control wild type mice, respectively. The macrophages were differentiated by culturing in RPMI 1640 medium, 20% FCS, in the presence of 10 ng/ml mouse macrophage colony-stimulating factor and 10 ng/ml mouse IL-4 for 7–10 days. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were generated from primary cultures of femoral marrow by culturing in the presence of 10 ng/ml mouse recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for 7–10 days. Kupffer cells (KC) were isolated from livers of CD36-deficient and normal rats using the method described by Smedsrød et al. (61.Smedsr⊘d B. Pertoft H. Eggertsen G. Sundström C. Cell Tissue Res. 1985; 241: 639-649PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications (62.Zaĭtseva E.V. Khung Veĭ Vishniakova T.G. Frolova E.G. Repin V.S. Bocharov A.V. Biull. Eksp. Biol. Med. 1994; 117: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), using OptiPrep Density gradient reagent (Sigma) instead of Percoll for density gradient centrifugation. In brief, the liver was perfused with 500 ml of Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution followed by the perfusion with 50 ml of 0.05% collagenase type H (Invitrogen) in Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 5 μm CaCl2. Hepatocytes were sedimented by repetitive centrifugations for 3 min at 50 × g in ice-cold Hanks' balanced salt solution. Supernatants containing sinusoidal nonparenchymal liver cells were collected and centrifuged for 5 min at 300 × g. Pelleted sinusoidal nonparenchymal liver cells were resuspended in 18% of OptiPrep density gradient reagent in Hanks' balanced salt solution and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 20 min. The sinusoidal nonparenchymal liver cells, banded at the top of the supernatant, were collected and pelleted by additional centrifugation for 5 min at 300 × g. The sinusoidal nonparenchymal liver cells suspension was plated in serum-free DMEM into 96-well culture plates for 15 min to allow KC to attach and spread. Nonattached cells were removed from the culture plates by extensive washing, and the KC were further cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS and 10 ng/ml macrophage colony-stimulating factor. SAA, native and oxidized lipoproteins, apoA-I, apoA-II, L3D-37pA, and BSA were conjugated with Alexa Fluor® 488, using a protein labeling kit (Invitrogen) following the vendor's instructions. HeLa cells were incubated with fluoro-labeled ligands at 37 °C for 1 h and then washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline, detached with Cellstripper dissociation solution (Mediatech, Herndon, VA), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS, model A; Hitachi). CD36-overexpressing HeLa cells grown in 24-well plates were incubated with 5 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 488 SAA without or with increasing concentrations of unlabeled ligands at 37 °C for 2 h, then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and detached from the plate surface by incubation in 200 μl of Cellstripper solution for 30 min at room temperature with continuous rocking on Rocker II (Boekel Scientific).

IntroductionThe process of eukaryotic gene regulation is intimately associated with the manipulation of chromatin structure. This is accomplished via a range of strategies that include protein complexes that remodel the structure of chromatin using the energy of ATP hydrolysis (for review, see Ref. 1.Becker P.B. Hörz W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 247-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) or covalently modify the core histones by acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, and ADP-ribosylation (for review, see Ref. 2.Kouzarides T. Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7926) Google Scholar). ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes share a catalytic subunit with homology to the yeast Snf2 protein. The helicase-related motifs within this region are thought to function as a DNA translocating motor (3.Cairns B.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Based on the homology within this region, Snf2-related proteins can be assigned to 24 subfamilies, many of which have been broadly conserved during the evolution of eukaryotes (4.Flaus A. Martin D.M. Barton G.J. Owen-Hughes T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2887-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Snf2 family proteins have a diverse range of functions with many, but not all, acting to alter chromatin structure. These ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes can generate a spectrum of different types of transition in chromatin structure ranging from nucleosome eviction or sliding to the exchange of histone dimers (3.Cairns B.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar).In this report, we investigate the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Snf2 family protein, Fun30 (Function unknown now 30). Fun30 was originally identified as a result of genome sequencing (5.Clark M.W. Zhong W.W. Keng T. Storms R.K. Barton A. Kaback D.B. Bussey H. Yeast. 1992; 8: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and shares most sequence homology with the Swr1 and Ino80 chromatin remodeling enzymes (4.Flaus A. Martin D.M. Barton G.J. Owen-Hughes T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2887-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), both of which are implicated in histone dimer exchange (6.Mizuguchi G. Shen X. Landry J. Wu W.H. Sen S. Wu C. Science. 2004; 303: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 7.Papamichos-Chronakis M. Krebs J.E. Peterson C.L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2437-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that yeast fun30 deletions are viable, but temperature sensitive (5.Clark M.W. Zhong W.W. Keng T. Storms R.K. Barton A. Kaback D.B. Bussey H. Yeast. 1992; 8: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and are resistant to ultraviolet (UV) radiation (8.Barton A.B. Kaback D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The overexpression of Fun30 has been shown to affect chromosome stability, integrity, and segregation (9.Ouspenski I.I. Elledge S.J. Brinkley B.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3001-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fun30 has also been shown to be a potential cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk1)/Cdc28 substrate (10.Ubersax J.A. Woodbury E.L. Quang P.N. Paraz M. Blethrow J.D. Shah K. Shokat K.M. Morgan D.O. Nature. 2003; 425: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). More recently, Fun30 has been found to play a role in gene silencing (11.Neves-Costa A. Will W.R. Vetter A.T. Miller J.R. Varga-Weisz P. Plos One. 2009; 4: e8111Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar).Fun30 is conserved through evolution and its mouse homologue, Etl1 (Enhancer Trap Locus 1), has been identified as being expressed during early development (12.Soininen R. Schoor M. Henseling U. Tepe C. Kisters-Woike B. Rossant J. Gossler A. Mech. Dev. 1992; 39: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Etl1 is widely expressed but non-essential, although deletion is associated with developmental defects such as skeletal dysplasia, growth retardation, and impaired fertility (13.Schoor M. Schuster-Gossler K. Gossler A. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 197: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14.Schoor M. Schuster-Gossler K. Roopenian D. Gossler A. Mech. Dev. 1999; 85: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The human homolog, SMARCAD1 (previously known as human helicase 1 (hHel1)), has been mapped to the chromosome 4q22–q23 region, which is rich in breakpoints and deletion mutants of genes involved in several human diseases, notably soft tissue leiomyosarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hematologic malignancies (15.Adra C.N. Donato J.L. Badovinac R. Syed F. Kheraj R. Cai H. Moran C. Kolker M.T. Turner H. Weremowicz S. Shirakawa T. Morton C.C. Schnipper L.E. Drews R. Genomics. 2000; 69: 162-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It has been recently reported that the binding sites of endogenous SMARCAD1/KIAA1122 are frequently found in the vicinity of transcriptional start sites (16.Okazaki N. Ikeda S. Ohara R. Shimada K. Yanagawa T. Nagase T. Ohara O. Koga H. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 382: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).To gain insight into the function of Fun30, we have purified it from tagged yeast strains. We obtain Fun30 as a homodimeric complex. This complex displays activity in a range of chromatin remodeling assays. Interestingly, the Fun30 complex displays increased activity in histone dimer exchange assays in comparison to nucleosome sliding. These results suggest that Fun30 function may involve the manipulation of the histone content of nucleosomes.DISCUSSIONThe S. cerevisiae Fun30 protein has been purified and found to exist predominantly as a homodimer. Like other Snf2 family proteins, it is capable of binding nucleosomes, hydrolyzing ATP, and disrupting nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent reaction. Fun30 was found to be especially proficient in catalyzing the exchange of histone dimers between nucleosomes in comparison, for example, to nucleosome sliding. This is consistent with the fact that based on sequence homology Fun30 is most closely related to the Swr1 and Ino80 proteins (4.Flaus A. Martin D.M. Barton G.J. Owen-Hughes T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2887-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), which have been reported to have activity in histone exchange (6.Mizuguchi G. Shen X. Landry J. Wu W.H. Sen S. Wu C. Science. 2004; 303: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 7.Papamichos-Chronakis M. Krebs J.E. Peterson C.L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2437-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The observation that Fun30 is relatively inefficient in repositioning nucleosomes supports previous work that suggests the mechanisms for dimer exchange and nucleosome sliding are distinct (32.Ferreira H. Somers J. Webster R. Flaus A. Owen-Hughes T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4037-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).The Swr1 complex exhibits specificity in histone exchange directing the incorporation of the histone variant Htz1 (6.Mizuguchi G. Shen X. Landry J. Wu W.H. Sen S. Wu C. Science. 2004; 303: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). It is possible that Fun30 also has specificity in directing exchange of specific histone subtypes; however, in our preliminary studies we obtained no evidence for this. Given that Fun30 contains a weak CUE motif potentially capable of interacting with ubiquitin, one hypothesis we investigated was that Fun30 directs the incorporation or removal of ubiquitinylated histones. However, we could obtain no evidence for specific binding of Fun30 to ubiquitinylated histones (Fig. 7), or the ability to exchange ubiquitinylated histones (data not shown). A caveat to this experiment is that HeLa cells were used as a source of chromatin and the possibility remains that there is specificity for a feature of yeast chromatin we may have missed. It is also worth noting that Fun30 binds DNA better than nucleosome core particles (Fig. 4C) and that this could potentially target the action of Fun30 to accessible regions of the genome.The observation that Fun30 elutes from gel filtration columns in a volume corresponding to a mass of 250 kDa could be interpreted as indicating the presence of a stable dimer. However, as elution volumes were observed to increase progressively when lower concentrations of Fun30 were loaded (data not shown) and TAP- and His-tagged Fun30 preparations interacted with each other in vitro, we favor the existence of a rapid equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric forms in solution. For some other remodeling enzymes, it is clear that the Snf2-related subunit is present as one copy (33.Smith C.L. Horowitz-Scherer R. Flanagan J.F. Woodcock C.L. Peterson C.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, in other cases the involvement of a pair of catalytic subunits is an emerging theme (29.Strohner R. Wachsmuth M. Dachauer K. Mazurkiewicz J. Hochstatter J. Rippe K. Längst G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 34.Racki L.R. Narlikar G.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2008; 18: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the case of Fun30, further investigation will be required to confirm that two molecules of Fun30 interact with a single nucleosome, although this is our favored interpretation of the cooperativity observed.The previously reported phenotypes of increased resistance to DNA damage induced by UV (8.Barton A.B. Kaback D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) together with our own observation that the deletion of Fun30 results in resistance to UV, ionizing radiation, and resistance to 6-azauracil (data not shown) might indicate an involvement in DNA repair. Interestingly, genome-wide surveys indicate physical and genetic interactions between Tel1 and Rad3, respectively (35.Gavin A.C. Bösche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J. Rick J.M. Michon A.M. Cruciat C.M. Remor M. Höfert C. Schelder M. Brajenovic M. Ruffner H. Merino A. Klein K. Hudak M. Dickson D. Rudi T. Gnau V. Bauch A. Bastuck S. Huhse B. Leutwein C.

Nature. 2007; 446: 806-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar). Mutations to the histone variant Htz1 also have repair phenotypes, and Fun30 exhibits synthetic lethality with Htz1 and several components of the Swr1 complex, which directs its incorporation (Vps71, Vps72, and Arp6) (37.Krogan N.J. Keogh M.C. Datta N. Sawa C. Ryan O.W. Ding H. Haw R.A. Pootoolal J. Tong A. Canadien V. Richards D.P. Wu X. Emili A. Hughes T.R. Buratowski S. Greenblatt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1565-1576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Thus, despite the lack of specificity for H2AZ in vitro, Fun30 functionally interacts with Htz1 in some way. The recent observation that Htz1 is targeted to nucleosomes adjacent to nucleosome-free regions resulted in speculation that the action of Swr1 might be targeted to regions of exposed DNA (38.Hartley P.D. Madhani H.D. Cell. 2009; 137: 445-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Nonspecific histone dimer exchange especially with S-phase could potentially contribute to this process. Fun30 has the potential to accelerate this process and based on its in vitro DNA binding properties could be targeted to nucleosome-free regions. Interactions between Fun30 and proteins involved in transcription (Taf13, Rpo21, Rpc40, and Rpc34) (36.Collins S.R. Miller K.M. Maas N.L. Roguev A. Fillingham J. Chu C.S. Schuldiner M. Gebbia M.

Although it is intriguing that Fun30 is linked to the process of DNA replication, repair, and transcription, which all involve histone exchange, further studies are required to reveal the nature of this association.

Keng T. Storms R.K. Barton A. Kaback D.B. Bussey H. Yeast. 1992; 8: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and are resistant to ultraviolet (UV) radiation (8.Barton A.B. Kaback D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The overexpression of Fun30 has been shown to affect chromosome stability, integrity, and segregation (9.Ouspenski I.I. Elledge S.J. Brinkley B.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 3001-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Fun30 has also been shown to be a potential cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk1)/Cdc28 substrate (10.Ubersax J.A. Woodbury E.L. Quang P.N. Paraz M. Blethrow J.D. Shah K. Shokat K.M. Morgan D.O. Nature. 2003; 425: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). More recently, Fun30 has been found to play a role in gene silencing (11.Neves-Costa A. Will W.R. Vetter A.T. Miller J.R. Varga-Weisz P. Plos One. 2009; 4: e8111Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fun30 is conserved through evolution and its mouse homologue, Etl1 (Enhancer Trap Locus 1), has been identified as being expressed during early development (12.Soininen R. Schoor M. Henseling U. Tepe C. Kisters-Woike B. Rossant J. Gossler A. Mech. Dev. 1992; 39: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Etl1 is widely expressed but non-essential, although deletion is associated with developmental defects such as skeletal dysplasia, growth retardation, and impaired fertility (13.Schoor M. Schuster-Gossler K. Gossler A. Dev. Dyn. 1993; 197: 227-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14.Schoor M. Schuster-Gossler K. Roopenian D. Gossler A. Mech. Dev. 1999; 85: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The human homolog, SMARCAD1 (previously known as human helicase 1 (hHel1)), has been mapped to the chromosome 4q22–q23 region, which is rich in breakpoints and deletion mutants of genes involved in several human diseases, notably soft tissue leiomyosarcoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and hematologic malignancies (15.Adra C.N. Donato J.L. Badovinac R. Syed F. Kheraj R. Cai H. Moran C. Kolker M.T. Turner H. Weremowicz S. Shirakawa T. Morton C.C. Schnipper L.E. Drews R. Genomics. 2000; 69: 162-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It has been recently reported that the binding sites of endogenous SMARCAD1/KIAA1122 are frequently found in the vicinity of transcriptional start sites (16.Okazaki N. Ikeda S. Ohara R. Shimada K. Yanagawa T. Nagase T. Ohara O. Koga H. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 382: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the function of Fun30, we have purified it from tagged yeast strains. We obtain Fun30 as a homodimeric complex. This complex displays activity in a range of chromatin remodeling assays. Interestingly, the Fun30 complex displays increased activity in histone dimer exchange assays in comparison to nucleosome sliding. These results suggest that Fun30 function may involve the manipulation of the histone content of nucleosomes. DISCUSSIONThe S. cerevisiae Fun30 protein has been purified and found to exist predominantly as a homodimer. Like other Snf2 family proteins, it is capable of binding nucleosomes, hydrolyzing ATP, and disrupting nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent reaction. Fun30 was found to be especially proficient in catalyzing the exchange of histone dimers between nucleosomes in comparison, for example, to nucleosome sliding. This is consistent with the fact that based on sequence homology Fun30 is most closely related to the Swr1 and Ino80 proteins (4.Flaus A. Martin D.M. Barton G.J. Owen-Hughes T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 2887-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), which have been reported to have activity in histone exchange (6.Mizuguchi G. Shen X. Landry J. Wu W.H. Sen S. Wu C. Science. 2004; 303: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar, 7.Papamichos-Chronakis M. Krebs J.E. Peterson C.L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2437-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The observation that Fun30 is relatively inefficient in repositioning nucleosomes supports previous work that suggests the mechanisms for dimer exchange and nucleosome sliding are distinct (32.Ferreira H. Somers J. Webster R. Flaus A. Owen-Hughes T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4037-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).The Swr1 complex exhibits specificity in histone exchange directing the incorporation of the histone variant Htz1 (6.Mizuguchi G. Shen X. Landry J. Wu W.H. Sen S. Wu C. Science. 2004; 303: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). It is possible that Fun30 also has specificity in directing exchange of specific histone subtypes; however, in our preliminary studies we obtained no evidence for this. Given that Fun30 contains a weak CUE motif potentially capable of interacting with ubiquitin, one hypothesis we investigated was that Fun30 directs the incorporation or removal of ubiquitinylated histones. However, we could obtain no evidence for specific binding of Fun30 to ubiquitinylated histones (Fig. 7), or the ability to exchange ubiquitinylated histones (data not shown). A caveat to this experiment is that HeLa cells were used as a source of chromatin and the possibility remains that there is specificity for a feature of yeast chromatin we may have missed. It is also worth noting that Fun30 binds DNA better than nucleosome core particles (Fig. 4C) and that this could potentially target the action of Fun30 to accessible regions of the genome.The observation that Fun30 elutes from gel filtration columns in a volume corresponding to a mass of 250 kDa could be interpreted as indicating the presence of a stable dimer. However, as elution volumes were observed to increase progressively when lower concentrations of Fun30 were loaded (data not shown) and TAP- and His-tagged Fun30 preparations interacted with each other in vitro, we favor the existence of a rapid equilibrium between monomeric and dimeric forms in solution. For some other remodeling enzymes, it is clear that the Snf2-related subunit is present as one copy (33.Smith C.L. Horowitz-Scherer R. Flanagan J.F. Woodcock C.L. Peterson C.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, in other cases the involvement of a pair of catalytic subunits is an emerging theme (29.Strohner R. Wachsmuth M. Dachauer K. Mazurkiewicz J. Hochstatter J. Rippe K. Längst G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 34.Racki L.R. Narlikar G.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2008; 18: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the case of Fun30, further investigation will be required to confirm that two molecules of Fun30 interact with a single nucleosome, although this is our favored interpretation of the cooperativity observed.The previously reported phenotypes of increased resistance to DNA damage induced by UV (8.Barton A.B. Kaback D.B. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1872-1880Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) together with our own observation that the deletion of Fun30 results in resistance to UV, ionizing radiation, and resistance to 6-azauracil (data not shown) might indicate an involvement in DNA repair. Interestingly, genome-wide surveys indicate physical and genetic interactions between Tel1 and Rad3, respectively (35.Gavin A.C. Bösche M. Krause R. Grandi P. Marzioch M. Bauer A. Schultz J.

Nature. 2007; 446: 806-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar).

Thus, despite the lack of specificity for H2AZ in vitro, Fun30 functionally interacts with Htz1 in some way.

Madhani H.D. Cell. 2009; 137: 445-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Nonspecific histone dimer exchange especially with S-phase could potentially contribute to this process. Fun30 has the potential to accelerate this process and based on its in vitro DNA binding properties could be targeted to nucleosome-free regions.

https://openalex.org/W1990409094,"The relationship between xylophagous termites and the protists resident in their hindguts is a textbook example of symbiosis. The essential steps of lignocellulose degradation handled by these protists allow the host termites to thrive on a wood diet. There has never been a comprehensive analysis of lignocellulose degradation by protists, however, as it has proven difficult to establish these symbionts in pure culture. The trends in lignocellulose degradation during the evolution of the host lineage are also largely unknown. To clarify these points without any cultivation technique, we performed meta-expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis of cDNA libraries originating from symbiotic protistan communities in four termite species and a wood-feeding cockroach. Our results reveal the establishment of a degradation system with multiple enzymes at the ancestral stage of termite-protistan symbiosis, especially GHF5 and 7. According to our phylogenetic analyses, the enzymes comprising the protistan lignocellulose degradation system are coded not only by genes innate to the protists, but also genes acquired by the protists via lateral transfer from bacteria. This gives us a fresh perspective from which to understand the evolutionary dynamics of symbiosis."
https://openalex.org/W2060076866,"CD1d-restricted invariant NKT (iNKT) cells are a subset of T lymphocytes endowed with innate effector functions that aid in the establishment of adaptive T and B cell immune responses. iNKT cells have been shown to play a spontaneous protective role against experimental tumors. Yet, the interplay between iNKT and tumor-specific T cells in cancer immune surveillance/editing has never been addressed. The transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) is a realistic model of spontaneous oncogenesis, in which the tumor-specific cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response undergoes full tolerance upon disease progression.We report here that lack of iNKT cells in TRAMP mice resulted in the appearance of more precocious and aggressive tumors that significantly reduced animal survival. TRAMP mice bearing or lacking iNKT cells responded similarly to a tumor-specific vaccination and developed tolerance to a tumor-associated antigen at comparable rate.Hence, our data argue for a critical role of iNKT cells in the immune surveillance of carcinoma that is independent of tumor-specific CTL."
https://openalex.org/W2115375393,"The mammalian circadian system, which is composed of a master pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) as well as other oscillators in the brain and peripheral tissues, controls daily rhythms of behavior and physiology. Lesions of the SCN abolish circadian rhythms of locomotor activity and transplants of fetal SCN tissue restore rhythmic behavior with the periodicity of the donor's genotype, suggesting that the SCN determines the period of the circadian behavioral rhythm. According to the model of timekeeping in the SCN, the Period (Per) genes are important elements of the transcriptional/translational feedback loops that generate the endogenous circadian rhythm. Previous studies have investigated the functions of the Per genes by examining locomotor activity in mice lacking functional PERIOD proteins. Variable behavioral phenotypes were observed depending on the line and genetic background of the mice. In the current study we assessed both wheel-running activity and Per1-promoter-driven luciferase expression (Per1-luc) in cultured SCN, pituitary, and lung explants from Per2−/− and Per3−/− mice congenic with the C57BL/6J strain. We found that the Per2−/− phenotype is enhanced in vitro compared to in vivo, such that the period of Per1-luc expression in Per2−/− SCN explants is 1.5 hours shorter than in Per2+/+ SCN, while the free-running period of wheel-running activity is only 11 minutes shorter in Per2−/− compared to Per2+/+ mice. In contrast, circadian rhythms in SCN explants from Per3−/− mice do not differ from Per3+/+ mice. Instead, the period and phase of Per1-luc expression are significantly altered in Per3−/− pituitary and lung explants compared to Per3+/+ mice. Taken together these data suggest that the function of each Per gene may differ between tissues. Per2 appears to be important for period determination in the SCN, while Per3 participates in timekeeping in the pituitary and lung."
https://openalex.org/W2059844749,"Phenotypic robustness, or canalization, has been extensively investigated both experimentally and theoretically. However, it remains unknown to what extent robustness varies between individuals, and whether factors buffering environmental variation also buffer genetic variation. Here we introduce a quantitative genetic approach to these issues, and apply this approach to data from three species. In mice, we find suggestive evidence that for hundreds of gene expression traits, robustness is polymorphic and can be genetically mapped to discrete genomic loci. Moreover, we find that the polymorphisms buffering genetic variation are distinct from those buffering environmental variation. In fact, these two classes have quite distinct mechanistic bases: environmental buffers of gene expression are predominantly sex-specific and trans-acting, whereas genetic buffers are not sex-specific and often cis-acting. Data from studies of morphological and life-history traits in plants and yeast support the distinction between polymorphisms buffering genetic and environmental variation, and further suggest that loci buffering different types of environmental variation do overlap with one another. These preliminary results suggest that naturally occurring polymorphisms affecting phenotypic robustness could be abundant, and that these polymorphisms may generally buffer either genetic or environmental variation, but not both."

In mycobacteria, G6P is a substrate for an enzyme, F420-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Fgd), found in few bacterial genera. Intracellular G6P levels in six Mycobacterium sp. were remarkably higher (∼17–130-fold) than Escherichia coli and Bacillus megaterium. The high G6P level in Mycobacterium smegmatis may result from 10–25-fold higher activity of the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase when grown on glucose, glycerol, or acetate compared with B. megaterium and E. coli. In M. smegmatis this coincided with up-regulation of the first gluconeogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, when acetate was the carbon source, suggesting a cellular program for maintaining high G6P levels. G6P was depleted in cells under oxidative stress induced by redox cycling agents plumbagin and menadione, whereas an fgd mutant of M. smegmatis used G6P less well under such conditions. The fgd mutant was more sensitive to these agents and, in contrast to wild type, was defective in its ability to reduce extracellular plumbagin and menadione.

M. tuberculosis is noteworthy because of its ability to grow and persist in the inhospitable, intracellular environment of alveolar macrophage vacuoles that provide the first line of host defense against common respiratory pathogens (2Rohde K. Yates R.M. Purdy G.E. Russell D.G. Immunol. Rev. 2007; 219: 37-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). One broad but incompletely understood mechanism thought to be important for intracellular control of M. tuberculosis is the complex mixture of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species such as superoxide and peroxynitrite produced by activated macrophages (3Nathan C.E. Ehrt S. Rom W.N. Garay S.M. Tuberculosis. 2nd Ed. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2004: 215-235Google Scholar). It is also thought that mechanisms used by M. tuberculosis to protect against these stress agents are similarly complex in that they are redundant and overlapping. The ability of the bacterium to adapt metabolically to this hostile and nutrient-poor intracellular vacuole environment (4Muñoz-Elias E.J. McKinney J.D. Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 10-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) is thought to play a major role in its pathogenicity. Anti-TB drugs and the BCG vaccine provide some protection against M. tuberculosis, but global control of TB is far from being achieved partly because of multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis strains and the synergistic effects of TB and AIDS (5Boshoff H.I. Barry C.E. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 6Berrington W.R. Hawn T.R. Immunol. Rev. 2007; 219: 167-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms of persistence are not well understood, impeding new drug development. Consequently, few anti-TB drugs have been developed in the last several decades. However, PA-824, a new nitroimidazopyran drug with strong bactericidal activity against both replicating and static M. tuberculosis, is now in a phase II clinical trial with the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development. To become bactericidal, PA-824 requires activation involving a mycobacterial F420-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Fgd) (7Stover C.K. Warrener P. VanDevanter D.R. Sherman D.R. Arain T.M.

Fgd, found only in Mycobacterium and Nocardia species, is an unusual glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase that transfers electrons from glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) to F420 instead of NADP (9Purwantini E. Daniels L. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2861-2866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Purwantini E. Gillis T.P. Daniels L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 146: 129-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). F420 is a 5-deazaflavin electron carrier first described in methanogenic archaea, where it plays roles in energy metabolism (11Eirich L.D. Vogels G.D. Wolfe R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 140: 20-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hartzell P.L. Zvilius G. Escalante-Semerena J.C. Donnelly M.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 1049-1053Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aside from methanogens and some other archea, F420 is produced by a limited number of genera such as Streptomyces, Nocardia, and Mycobacterium species (10Purwantini E. Gillis T.P. Daniels L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 146: 129-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Naraoka T. Mamoi K. Fukasawa K. Goto M. Biochim. Biophys.

Daniels L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 5750-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fgd is the only known enzyme in Mycobacterium and Nocardia species using F420 as an electron acceptor. Although the intracellular fate of reduced F420 is unknown, it has been suggested that it could be required for anaerobic survival (5Boshoff H.I. Barry C.E. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 70-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In Mycobacterium smegmatis, F420 is important for decolorization of malachite green, and mutants not making F420 are more sensitive to superoxide-mediated oxidative stress (18Guerra-Lopez D. Daniels L. Rawat M. Microbiology. 2007; 153: 2724-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although Fgd shows no significant homology with NADP-dependent glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) (19Purwantini E. Daniels L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2212-2219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), both catalyze similar electron transfer reactions and require glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) as the source of electrons to make reduced coenzymes F420H2 and NADPH, respectively. Glucose 6-phosphate, derived from glucose through the glycolytic enzymes hexokinase or glucokinase and through gluconeogenesis, generates reducing power via the pentose phosphate pathway. In mycobacteria, G6P is also an important precursor of cell wall components l-rhamnose and the galactan of arabinogalactan (20Tuckman D. Donnelly R.J. Zhao F.X. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Connell N.D. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2724-2730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, because G6P is a central intermediate with many possible fates, we sought to understand the role of Fgd in G6P metabolism. Our interest in Fgd and its role in PA-824 activation led us to examine G6P levels in mycobacteria. Previous studies have measured G6P in other species, including Escherichia coli, Streptomyces coelicolor, and Corynebacterium glutamicum (21Dietzler D.N. Leckie M.P. Magnani J.L. Sughrue M.J.

Biochem. 1998; 254: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). However, none examined mycobacteria. We found a remarkably high G6P level in all Mycobacterium species examined, compared with E. coli and Bacillus megaterium. An investigation of related metabolic pathways revealed that mycobacteria preferentially accumulate G6P over other gluconeogenic intermediates through a significantly higher activity (compared with other bacteria examined) of the key gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fbp) and when cells are grown on acetate through increased GTP-dependent phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck) activity. We also found that G6P levels are depleted in cells under oxidative stress induced by plumbagin and menadione, which increase superoxide concentration in the cells (24Hassan H.M. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 196: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). On the other hand, interruption of M. smegmatis fgd lowered the capacity to utilize G6P under oxidative stress, while making the bacteria more sensitive to plumbagin and menadione. Our data demonstrate the unusual metabolic properties of mycobacteria, which could be an important part of their anti-oxidant defense mechanisms. The bacteria used in this study were M. smegmatis strain mc2155, Mycobacterium bovis strain BCG Montreal, Mycobacterium fortuitum ATCC 6841, Mycobacterium gordonae ATCC 14470, Mycobacterium phlei ATCC 11758, Mycobacterium chelonae ATCC 35752, E. coli K-12, E. coli DH5α, and B. megaterium. Unless otherwise mentioned, for plate experiments, bacteria were grown on Middlebrook 7H9 agar with 0.2% glycerol at 35 °C. Typically, no Tween 80 was included. For both experiments, 1 ml of bacterial suspensions with an A600 of 0.3 prepared from plates were used to inoculate 500 ml of Middlebrook 7H9 medium with 0.2% glycerol; cultures were grown at 35 °C in 2.8-liter baffled Fernbach flasks. The fgd mutant of M. smegmatis was grown in the same way except that the pregrowth agar medium contained kanamycin (20 μg ml−1). For initial measurement of G6P in different bacteria, E. coli and B. megaterium were grown for 24 h, M. smegmatis for 72 h, M. bovis BCG for 10 days, and all other mycobacteria for 5 days. Growth curves for E. coli and B. megaterium were constructed by monitoring A600 every 2 h for 28 h, and the growth curve of M. smegmatis was determined from dry cell weight. Time points to collect samples (100 ml) representative of different growth phases were determined from these curves. For E. coli and B. megaterium, time points for the exponential, early stationary, and stationary phases were 12, 15, and 24 h, respectively. For M. smegmatis time points for the exponential, early stationary, and stationary phases were 48, 55, and 72 h, respectively. For carbon starvation, glycerol concentration in M. smegmatis growth medium was lowered to 0.02%. For nitrogen starvation, Middlebrook 7H9 medium was modified to have 0.05 g/liter ammonium sulfate and sodium l-glutamate, and sodium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 0.45 g/liter to replenish sulfate. For phosphate starvation, the disodium phosphate and monopotassium phosphate concentrations were lowered to 0.05 and 0.02 g/liter, respectively, and sodium chloride and potassium chloride were added to final concentrations of 0.5 and 0.1 g/liter, respectively, to replenish sodium and potassium. For sulfate starvation, ammonium sulfate concentration was lowered to 0.01 g/liter, and ammonium chloride was added to a final concentration of 0.2 g/liter to replenish ammonia. To grow cells under oxidative stress, M. smegmatis was grown to mid-log phase (48 h), followed by the addition of plumbagin (Indofine Chemical Company, Inc.) and menadione (MP Biomedicals, LLC) (each dissolved in Me2SO) to final concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mm, respectively. Me2SO was added to the control flask to a final concentration of 0.1%. 100 ml of bacterial suspensions were collected at 0 h (prior to addition of plumbagin or menadione) and at 3, 6, and 12 h afterward. M. smegmatis fgd was inactivated using insertional mutagenesis. The Geneblock® kanamycin cassette was digested with BamHI and inserted into the BglII site of pEP7000, a pBluescriptII SK+-based clone of the M. smegmatis fgd locus (19Purwantini E. Daniels L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2212-2219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to obtain pEP8300, in which the aph element was flanked with 2,741 bp DNA upstream and 4,052 bp DNA downstream. The 8,300-bp BamHI fragment from pEP8300 carrying the fgd::aph segment was cloned into the BamHI site of pJQ200KS to generate the suicide plasmid pEP8300A. M. smegmatis mc2155 was electroporated with pEP8300A, grown 24 h under nonselective conditions, and then plated on LB containing kanamycin (20 μg/ml) and 10% sucrose. This sacB-mediated sucrose counterselection and kanamycin-based selection step allowed the isolation of cells that acquired the aph cassette into the fgd gene on their chromosomes via a double cross-over recombination. The mutants were characterized by Southern hybridization and Fgd enzyme assay. For complementation, Phusion high fidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) was used to PCR clone fgd from M. smegmatis mc2155 chromosomal DNA into the expression vector pSMT3 (25O Gaora P. Parish T. Stoker N.G. Mycobacteria protocols. Vol. 101. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 261-272Google Scholar). Primers fgd-for-EcoRV (5′-GTAGATATCAATGGTGGCTGAATTGAAGCTAGGTTACAAGGC) and fgd-rev-Acl 5′-GCTAACGTTCACGAGTGCCCAGAATCAGGCCAG) contained restriction sites for in-frame cloning. PCR product and vector were digested with EcoRV and AclI; the resulting fragments were cleaned with Qiagen gel extraction kit, ligated, and transformed into E. coli DH5α following standard cloning techniques (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Hygromycin-resistant colonies (200 μg/ml) were isolated. The vector and two independent clones were electroporated into the fgd::kan mutant; hygromycin-resistant colonies (50 μg/ml) were purified and examined for Fgd activity and napthoquinone sensitivity. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and resuspended (0.5 g of wet cells/ml of buffer). E. coli and B. megaterium were lysed by sonication for 3–5 min with successive sonication (1 min) and cooling (1 min) cycles, and mycobacteria were lysed by bead beating for 3 min with successive beating (30 s; 46,000 rpm) and cooling (30 s) cycles using a Mini-Beadbeater (Biospec Products) and 0.1 mm zirconia/silica beads (Biospec Products) with a cell suspension to bead ratio of 50:50 (V:V). The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were used for enzyme assay. Protein concentration was determined by a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Sigma). Enzyme extract aliquots were boiled for 10 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were used for metabolite assays. Enzyme activities in 10 μl of cell extracts were measured spectrophotometrically at room temperature. G6PDH activity was determined by measuring the rate of increase in A340 caused by reduction of NADP. The final assay (1 ml) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.7 mm NADP, and 2 mm glucose 6-phosphate. Fgd activity was determined by measuring the rate of decrease in A400 caused by reduction of coenzyme F420. Coenzyme F420 was purified as described earlier (27Purwantini E. Mukhopadhyay B. Spencer R.W. Daniels L. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 205: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The Fgd assay (1 ml) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.025 mm F420, and 5 mm glucose 6-phosphate. Fbp activity was determined using an EnzCheck phosphate assay kit (Invitrogen) to follow the kinetics of Pi release from fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. Briefly, 10 μl of cell extract was mixed with the reaction buffer, the substrate 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside, and purine nucleoside phosphorylase provided with the kit to final concentrations of 1×, 0.2 mm, and 1 unit/ml, respectively. The mixture was incubated for 10 min before the reaction was started by the addition of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate to 0.1 mm. The reaction was monitored by the increase in A360. ATP-dependent phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (ATP-Pck) activity was determined by measuring the decrease in A340 caused by NADPH oxidation. The final reaction (1 ml) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 75 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ADP, 0.3 mm NADH, and 5 units/ml malate dehydrogenase. The reaction mixture was preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and the reaction was started by the addition of phosphoenolpyruvate to final concentration of 5 mm. GTP-dependent phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP-Pck) activity was determined in the same way except that GDP was used instead of ADP. In all experiments, the reactions were initiated by substrate addition. An assay mixture with all components except substrate was used as a control for each assay. The reaction rate (ΔAbsorbance/min) calculated from the slope of linear plots (R2 = 0.95–1.0) from 0 to 3 min or 0 to 5 min was normalized to the control, and specific activities (μmol min−1 mg−1 protein) of enzymes were calculated based on extinction coefficients of NADPH and NADH (6.22 mm−1 cm −1), F420 (25 mm−1 cm −1), and 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside (11 mm−1 cm −1) (28Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar) and the protein concentration. The experiments were independently repeated three times. Intracellular metabolite concentration was determined enzymatically as described by Bergmeyer (29Bergmeyer H. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis Vol. 6. 3rd Ed. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim1985Google Scholar, 30Bergmeyer H. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis Vol. 7. 3rd Ed. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim1985Google Scholar), with modifications. Pure metabolites (>99%; Sigma) were used as standards and to confirm that boiling did not affect stability in heat treated extracts. G6P was determined by measuring the increase of A340 of a solution (1 ml) containing 0.05–0.4 ml of heat treated extracts, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.7 mm NADP, and 0.5 unit/ml G6PDH. After the G6P reaction was complete, phosphoglucoisomerase or phosphoglucomutase was added to 0.5 or 1 unit/ml, and the change of A340 was recorded to determine the concentration of fructose-6-phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate, respectively. 6-Phosphogluconate was determined by applying the same procedure as that for G6P except that 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (0.025 unit/ml) was used instead of G6PDH. Pyruvate concentration was determined by measuring the decrease of A340 of a solution (1 ml) containing 0.2–0.5 ml of heat treated cell extracts, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgSO4, 1 mm ADP, 0.3 mm NADH, and 1 unit/ml lactate dehydrogenase. After the pyruvate reaction was complete, pyruvate kinase was added to 3.8 units/ml, and the change of A340 was recorded to determine the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) concentration. In all of the experiments, the reactions were initiated by the addition of enzymes. Metabolite concentration, expressed as μmol g−1 protein, were calculated from ΔA340, extinction coefficients of NADPH and NADH, and protein concentration. The experiments were repeated independently three times. Sensitivity of M. smegmatis strains to plumbagin and menadione were determined by disc diffusion assay. Cell suspensions (A600 of 0.5) were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline from 48-h plate-grown cells. 100-μl suspensions were spread onto Middlebrook 7H9 plates with 0.2% glycerol to prepare a lawn of cells. Filter paper discs (7-mm diameter) containing plumbagin (0.025 μmol) or menadione (0.5 μmol) were placed on the lawns, and the cells were grown for 48 h. The diameters of clear zones were averaged from three independent experiments in triplicate. Cell-free medium obtained by centrifugation of 1 ml of bacterial suspension, collected at each time point (0, 3, 6, and 12 h after the addition of plumbagin or menadione to cells grown 48 h in Middlebrook 7H9 medium with 0.2% glycerol) from the bacterial culture were diluted in fresh culture medium and subjected to UV-visible spectral analysis. Absorbance at 419 nm (for oxidized plumbagin) and at 337 nm (for oxidized menadione) was plotted against time. A two-tailed t test at 95% confidence level was used to calculate p values. We compared the G6P level of six Mycobacterium species with E. coli and B. megaterium grown in Middlebrook 7H9 with glycerol as the carbon source and observed significantly higher G6P levels in all of the Mycobcterium species tested. G6P levels in different mycobacteria were 7–30 μmol g−1 protein, which were 17–130-fold higher than that of E. coli and B. megaterium (Table 1). With the exception of a related bacterium, C. glutamicum (where G6P was estimated at 29 μmol g−1 protein), the G6P concentration in mycobacteria is also much higher than those reported earlier for E. coli (1 μmol g−1 protein) and higher than in S. coelicolor (1–4 μmol g−1 protein) (21Dietzler D.N.

Biochem. 1998; 254: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that mycobacteria have three enzymes for entry of G6P into the pentose phosphate pathway (two G6PDH and Fgd) and use G6P for energy generation and cell wall oligosaccharide biosynthesis, G6P accumulates to surprisingly high levels. We thus sought metabolic explanations for this surplus.TABLE 1Intracellular glucose 6-phosphate concentrations in different bacteriaBacteriaGlucose 6-phosphateμmol g−1 proteinE. coli K-120.23 ± 0.06E. coli DH5α0.41B. megaterium0.23 ± 0.06M. smegmatis30.5 ± 0.9BCG17.5 ± 0.43M. chelonae12.6 ± 0.17M. fortuitum23.0 ± 0.8M. gordonae10.1 ± 0.6M. phlei7.1 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab To obtain insight on intracellular G6P and related metabolic characteristics in mycobacteria and to investigate the mechanisms of their higher G6P accumulation, we first looked at the metabolic pathways that contribute to biosynthesis and consumption of G6P and selected related metabolic intermediates and enzymes for comparison between M. smegmatis, E. coli, and B. megaterium (Fig. 1). To follow formation and consumption of different metabolites over time, enzymes and metabolites were assayed at intervals to represent the exponential, early stationary, and stationary phases of growth. G6P in M. smegmatis accumulated to higher levels at later phases of growth and was always present in relatively high amounts, whereas it was hardly detectable in E. coli and B. megaterium at any growth phase (Fig. 2A). 6-Phosphogluconate was hardly detectable for any species at any time. We observed consistent ratios of G6P to fructose-6-phosphate of 2.5 ± 0.46 and G6P to glucose-1-phosphate of 12.3 ± 3.3 at all phases of growth in M. smegmatis. Because of the low levels of these metabolites in E. coli and B. megaterium, reliable ratios could not be determined in these species. When intermediates at the starting point of the gluconeogenic pathway, in particular PEP, were compared for M. smegmatis, E. coli, and B. megaterium, the results were opposite to what was observed for G6P. The PEP level was remarkably lower in M. smegmatis than the other bacteria at the exponential phase (p < 0.01), although PEP levels declined in E. coli and B. megaterium at later growth phases. Pyruvate levels were similar in all three bacteria. To explain the differences in metabolite levels, we first determined enzyme activities for G6PDH and Fgd, which produce NADPH and reduced F420, respectively (Fig. 2B). G6PDH levels were generally similar in the three species at different growth phases, except that higher activity was observed in E. coli in stationary phase. The combined levels of G6PDH and Fgd in M. smegmatis represent a major route of G6P consumption, and because their sum is not significantly lower than E. coli G6PDH activity, they do not account for the high levels of M. smegmatis G6P. Because G6P accumulation was not a result of lower consumption capability, we reasoned that the biosynthetic rate of G6P could be different in M. smegmatis. Fbp and Pck are the two key enzymes of gluconeogenesis that regulate gluconeogenic carbon flow (31Moat A.G. Foster J.W. Microbial Physiology. 3rd Ed. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Although Pck in bacteria is generally ATP-dependent, M. smegmatis has a GTP-dependent Pck but is missing the gene for an ATP-dependent Pck (32Mukhopadhyay B. Concar E.M. Wolfe R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16137-16145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, both ATP-dependent and GTP-dependent Pck were assayed in this study. As shown in Fig. 2B, Fbp activity was 10–25-fold higher in M. smegmatis, although Pck activity was significantly lower than that of E. coli (p < 0.05 at the exponential and stationary phases). Because the gene encoding ATP-dependent Pck is absent in M. smegmatis, the ATP-PCK activity observed in M. smegmatis is likely due to conversion of ATP to GTP, during the preincubation period, catalyzed by nucleoside diphosphate kinase (33Shankar S. Hershberger C.D. Chakrabarty A.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because cells used for these analyses were grown in a medium containing glycerol as the carbon source, the pathways of glycerol utilization in mycobacteria (Fig. 1) suggest that G6P accumulation could occur through the higher activity of Fbp irrespective of Pck activity by using only a part of the gluconeogenic pathway. These results also explain why PEP was hardly detectable in M. smegmatis, whereas there was an accumulation in both E. coli and B. megaterium at least during the exponential phase. Although M. smegmatis accumulated G6P from glycerol, likely bypassing the part of the gluconeogenic pathway that requires Pck activity, we asked whether this bacterium also makes high levels of G6P from acetate, which requires the complete gluconeogenic pathway and hence Pck activity. To address this question and to also examine whether mycobacteria accumulate G6P from different carbon substrates, we grew M. smegmatis with glycerol, glucose, or acetate. We found that G6P levels in M. smegmatis grown in glucose or acetate are less than that observed in glycerol grown cells but are still much higher than those observed in the other bacteria grown on glycerol (Fig. 3A). Less G6P in glucose- or acetate-grown cells compared with glycerol-grown cells could be related to their growth phase because the cells were grown on different substrates for the same time period, and cell growth was slower in glucose and acetate (data not shown). G6PDH, Fgd, and Fbp activities were comparable for mycobacteria grown with different substrates (Fig. 3B). However, GTP-Pck activity was significantly up-regulated (p < 0.0001) in cells grown in acetate, which could explain the mechanism of G6P accumulation in these cells, suggesting that mycobacteria are metabolically adapted to accumulate G6P. To investigate whether G6P accumulation is affected by nutritional conditions, M. smegmatis was grown under carbon, nitrogen, phosphate, and sulfate starvation. Based on visual observations (data not shown), bacterial growth was reduced by carbon or nitrogen starvation, whereas little difference from control was obse"

However, the mechanisms that regulate Foxp3 expression and thereby modulate tumor development remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that Foxp3 up-regulation requires p53 function, showing that Foxp3 expression is directly regulated by p53 upon DNA damage responses in human breast and colon carcinoma cells. Treatment with the genotoxic agents, doxorubicin or etoposide, induced Foxp3 expression in p53-positive carcinoma cells, but not in cells lacking p53 function. Furthermore, knock down of endogenous wild-type p53 using RNA interference abrogated Foxp3 induction by genotoxic agents, and exogenous expression of p53 in cells lacking p53 restored the responsiveness of Foxp3 to DNA-damaging stresses. In addition, Foxp3 knock down blunted the p53-mediated growth inhibitory response to DNA-damaging agents. These results suggest that induction of Foxp3 in the context of tumor suppression is regulated in a p53-dependent manner and implicate Foxp3 as a key determinant of cell fate in p53-dependent DNA damage responses."
https://openalex.org/W2130042463,"Rice is a very important food staple that feeds more than half the world's population. Two major Asian cultivated rice (Oryza sativa L.) subspecies, japonica and indica, show significant phenotypic variation in their stress responses. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenotypic variation are still largely unknown. A common link among different stresses is that they produce an oxidative burst and result in an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, methyl viologen (MV) as a ROS agent was applied to investigate the rice oxidative stress response. We observed that 93-11 (indica) seedlings exhibited leaf senescence with severe lesions under MV treatment compared to Nipponbare (japonica). Whole-genome microarray experiments were conducted, and 1,062 probe sets were identified with gene expression level polymorphisms between the two rice cultivars in addition to differential expression under MV treatment, which were assigned as Core Intersectional Probesets (CIPs). These CIPs were analyzed by gene ontology (GO) and highlighted with enrichment GO terms related to toxin and oxidative stress responses as well as other responses. These GO term-enriched genes of the CIPs include glutathine S-transferases (GSTs), P450, plant defense genes, and secondary metabolism related genes such as chalcone synthase (CHS). Further insertion/deletion (InDel) and regulatory element analyses for these identified CIPs suggested that there may be some eQTL hotspots related to oxidative stress in the rice genome, such as GST genes encoded on chromosome 10. In addition, we identified a group of marker genes individuating the japonica and indica subspecies. In summary, we developed a new strategy combining biological experiments and data mining to study the possible molecular mechanism of phenotypic variation during oxidative stress between Nipponbare and 93-11. This study will aid in the analysis of the molecular basis of quantitative traits."
https://openalex.org/W2027389535,"Carrageenan (CGN) is a high molecular weight sulphated polysaccharide derived from red seaweeds. In rodents, its degraded forms (dCGN) can induce intestinal inflammation associated with macrophage recruitment and activation. The aim of this study was: 1) to analyze the size-dependent effects of dCGN on colon inflammation in vivo, and 2) to correlate these effects with monocyte/macrophage proliferation, cytokine production and expression of various cell surface antigens including ICAM-1 adhesion molecule. Peripheral blood monocytes (PBM) and THP-1 monocytic cells were cultured in the presence of either 10 or 40 kDa, dCGN. The 40 kDa, but not the 10 kDa dCGN, induced colitis in in vivo. Degraded CGN inhibited THP-1 cell proliferation in vitro, arresting the cells in G1 phase. In addition, dCGN increased ICAM-1 expression in both PBM and THP-1 cells with a major effect seen after 40 kDa dCGN exposure. Also, dCGN stimulated monocyte aggregation in vitro that was prevented by incubation with anti-ICAM-1 antibody. Finally, dCGN stimulated TNF-alpha expression and secretion by both PBM and THP-1 cells. All these effects were linked to NF-kappaB activation. These data strongly suggest that the degraded forms of CGN have a pronounced effect on monocytes, characteristic of an inflammatory phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1969054982,"Background Most medicinal plants contain a mixture of bioactive compounds, including chemicals that interact with intracellular targets and others that can act as adjuvants to facilitate absorption of polar agents across cellular membranes. However, little is known about synergistic effects between such potential drug candidates and adjuvants. To probe for such effects, we tested the green tea compound epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and the membrane permeabilising digitonin on Plasmodium sporozoite motility and viability. Methodology/Principal Findings Green fluorescent P. berghei sporozoites were imaged using a recently developed visual screening methodology. Motility and viability parameters were automatically analyzed and IC50 values were calculated, and the synergism of drug and adjuvant was assessed by the fractional inhibitory concentration index. Validating our visual screening procedure, we showed that sporozoite motility and liver cell infection is inhibited by EGCG at nontoxic concentrations. Digitonin synergistically increases the cytotoxicity of EGCG on sporozoite survival, but shows an additive effect on sporozoite motility. Conclusions/Significance We proved the feasibility of performing highly reliable visual screens for compounds against Plasmodium sporozoites. We thereby could show an advantage of administering mixtures of plant metabolites on inhibition of cell motility and survival. Although the effective concentration of both drugs is too high for use in malaria prophylaxis, the demonstration of a synergistic effect between two plant compounds could lead to new avenues in drug discovery."

https://openalex.org/W2049697667,"We have studied oxygenation of fatty acids by cell extract of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 42A2. Oleic acid ((9Z)-18:1) was transformed to (10S)-hydroperoxy-(8E)-octadecenoic acid ((10S)-HPOME) and to (7S,10S)-dihydroxy-(8E)-octadecenoic acid (7,10-DiHOME). Experiments under oxygen-18 showed that 7,10-DiHOME contained oxygen from air and was formed sequentially from (10S)-HPOME by isomerization. (10R)-HPOME was not isomerized. The (10S)-dioxygenase and hydroperoxide isomerase activities co-eluted on ion exchange chromatography and on gel filtration with an apparent molecular size of approximately 50 kDa. 16:1n-7, 18:2n-6, and 20:1n-11 were also oxygenated to 7,10-dihydroxy fatty acids, and (8Z)-18:1 was oxygenated to 6,9-dihydroxy-(7E)-octadecenoic acid. A series of fatty acids with the double bond positioned closer to ((6Z)-18:1, (5Z,9Z)-18:2) or more distant from the carboxyl group ((11Z)-, (13Z)-, and (15Z)-18:1) were poor substrates. The oxygenation mechanism was studied with [7S-(2)H]18:1n-9, [7R-(2)H]18:2n-6, and [8R-(2)H]18:2n-6 as substrates. The pro-R hydrogen at C-8 was lost in the biosynthesis of (10S)-HPODE, whereas the pro-S hydrogen was lost and the pro-R hydrogen was retained at C-7 during biosynthesis of the 7,10-dihydroxy metabolites. Analysis of the fatty acid composition of P. aeruginosa revealed relatively large amounts of (9E/Z)-16:1 and (11E/Z)-18:1 and only traces of 18:1n-9. We found that (11Z)-18:1 (vaccenic acid) was transformed to (11S,14S)-dihydroxy-(12E)-octadecenoic acid and to a mixture of 11- and 12-HPOME, possibly due to reverse orientation of (11Z)-18:1 at the active site compared with oleic acid. The reaction mechanism of the hydroperoxide isomerase suggests catalytic similarities to cytochrome P450."
https://openalex.org/W1970871207,"Deep sequencing of transcriptome (RNA-seq) provides unprecedented opportunity to interrogate plausible mRNA splicing patterns by mapping RNA-seq reads to exon junctions (thereafter junction reads). In most previous studies, exon junctions were detected by using the quantitative information of junction reads. The quantitative criterion (e.g. minimum of two junction reads), although is straightforward and widely used, usually results in high false positive and false negative rates, owning to the complexity of transcriptome. Here, we introduced a new metric, namely Minimal Match on Either Side of exon junction (MMES), to measure the quality of each junction read, and subsequently implemented an empirical statistical model to detect exon junctions. When applied to a large dataset (>200M reads) consisting of mouse brain, liver and muscle mRNA sequences, and using independent transcripts databases as positive control, our method was proved to be considerably more accurate than previous ones, especially for detecting junctions originated from low-abundance transcripts. Our results were also confirmed by real time RT-PCR assay. The MMES metric can be used either in this empirical statistical model or in other more sophisticated classifiers, such as logistic regression."
https://openalex.org/W2033067702,"Chemotactic cells must sense shallow extracellular gradients and produce localized intracellular responses. We previously showed that the temporal and spatial activation of two protein kinase B (PKB) homologues, PkbA and PkbR1, in Dictyostelium discoideum by phosphorylation of activation loops (ALs) and hydrophobic motifs had important roles in chemotaxis. We found that hydrophobic motif phosphorylation depended on regulation of TorC2 (target of rapamycin complex 2); however, the regulation of AL phosphorylation remains to be determined at a molecular level. Here, we show that two PDK (phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase) homologues, PdkA and PdkB, function as the key AL kinases. Cells lacking both PdkA and PdkB are defective in PKB activation, chemotaxis, and fruiting body formation upon nutrient deprivation. The pleckstrin homology domain of PdkA is sufficient to localize it to the membrane, but transient activation of PdkA is independent of PIP3 as well as TorC2 and dispensable for full function.

These results confirm the importance of the TorC2-PDK-PKB pathway in chemotaxis and point to a novel mechanism of regulation of PDKs by chemoattractant. Many cells can detect extracellular chemical gradients and move toward or away from higher concentrations in a process referred to as chemotaxis or directed cell migration. In embryogenesis, chemotaxis is used repeatedly to rearrange cells, for instance, during primordial germ cell migration, organ formation, and wiring of the nervous system. In the adult, chemotaxis mediates trafficking of immune cells and participates in wound healing and in maintenance of tissue architecture and allows stem cells to target to and persist in their niches. Chemotaxis also plays an important role in pathological states such as excessive inflammation and cancer metastasis. Current studies indicate that chemotaxis involves a network of interconnected signaling pathways (1.King J.S. Insall R.H. Trends Cell Biol. 2009; 19: 523-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).

Kamimura Y. Devreotes P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2006; 16: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It is thought that the effects of PIP3 are mediated by the local recruitment and activation of AKT/PKB. Unregulated overproduction of PIP3, as occurs in cells lacking the lipid phosphatases, PTEN or SHIP1, causes ectopic projections outside of the leading edge and impairs chemotaxis (3.Iijima M.

Similarly, direct activation of PI3K, bypassing the receptor, is sufficient to trigger cell extensions (5.Inoue T. Meyer T. PLoS One. 2008; 3: e3068Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, cells lacking PIP3 production can still carry out chemotaxis (6.Chen L. Iijima M. Tang M. Landree M.A. Huang Y.E. Xiong Y. Iglesias P.A. Devreotes P.N. Dev.

The apparent paradox was explained in Dictyostelium discoideum by showing that chemoattractants still trigger the phosphorylation of PKB substrates in the absence of PIP3 (9.Kamimura Y. Xiong Y.

This is because the cAMP signaling pathways converge on two PKB homologues, a PIP3-dependent enzyme, PkbA, with a PIP3-specific pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at its N terminus and a PIP3-independent enzyme, PkbR1, which is tethered to the plasma membrane via N-terminal myristoylation (10.Meili R.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2092-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). The activation of the PKBs, including the PIP3-independent regulation of PkbR1, is restricted to the leading edge of chemotaxing cells, and the substrates of these kinases are believed to regulate the cytoskeleton (9.Kamimura Y.

So far, six novel substrates have been found to be targets of the PKBs. These include the cytoskeletal protein, TalinB, the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors GefN and GefS, the PI(4)P-dependent PI5 kinase PI5K, the Rho GTPase-activating enzyme GacQ, and the p21-activated kinase PakA (9.Kamimura Y.

One of the earliest genetic defects in chemotaxis to be described in D. discoideum was in the gene PianissimoA (piaA), later shown to be a subunit of TorC2 (16.Chen M.Y. Long Y. Devreotes P.N.

Because AL phosphorylation in PkbR1 is independent of PIP3, the mechanism of its regulation is not known. It may rely, for example, on an observed absolute prerequisite for HM phosphorylation. However, a version of PkbR1 containing phosphomimetic substitution in the HM, expressed in cells lacking PiaA, is still phosphorylated on the AL with normal kinetics, suggesting an independent layer of regulation of AL phosphorylation (9.Kamimura Y.

To understand the spatial and temporal regulation of the PKBs by chemoattractant, we sought to determine the kinases that phosphorylate the ALs and study their regulation. In mammalian cells, AL phosphorylation in AKT/PKB is mediated by PDK1 (14.Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr.

There are two PDK1 homologues in the D. discoideum genome, PdkA and PdkB. In this report, we determine the roles of these enzymes in activation of PkbA and PkbR1 and in regulation of the chemotactic response. Cells were cultured axenically in HL5 medium at 22 °C. pdkA−, pdkB−, and pdkA−pdkB− cells were constructed in an AX3 background using a disruption cassette containing the blasticidin S-resistant (BSR) gene. The PDKA disruption plasmid was made by the following steps. First, the region between +744 and +1561 (where +1 is the first base of the open reading frame in the pdkA genomic DNA) was deleted, and a SmaI site was created by PCR using pCR4-PDKA as a template and primers YK176 and YK177. Next, the BSR cassette was inserted into the SmaI site, and the DNA was digested with the EcoRI before transformation into D. discoideum cells. PDKB disruption plasmid was also made by the same strategy as PDKA. The region between +849 and +1967 of the pdkB genomic DNA was replaced by the BSR cassette using pCR4-PDKB and primers YK178 and YK179. The DNA was digested with NotI and PmeI. The pdkA−pdkB− double mutant cells were made as follows. The BSR gene in pdkA− cells was removed by transformation with a Cre expression plasmid. Then, the pdkB gene was disrupted as above. All mutants were confirmed by Southern blot analysis. To assess developmental phenotypes, cells growing in HL5 medium were washed with development buffer (DB) and plated on 1.5% non-nutrient DB agar. For differentiation, cells grown in HL5 were washed with DB and starved in DB for 1 h at 2 × 107 cells/ml and then pulsed with 60 nm of cAMP every 6 min for 4 h (19.Kamimura Y. Tang M. Devreotes P. Methods Mol. Biol. 2009; 571: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). A pdkA genomic DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using AX3 genomic DNA as a template and primers YK151 and YK166 and cloned into pCR4 and finally denoted as pCR4-PDKA. A pdkB genomic DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using AX3 genomic DNA as a template and primers YK154 and YK155 and cloned into pCR4 and finally denoted as pCR4-PDKB. For GFP fusion constructs, both DNA were cloned into the BglII and XhoI sites of pEX-GFP. For PDKA deletion series, each region was amplified by PCR and cloned in pEX-GFP. Differentiated cells were shaken at 200 rpm in DB with 5 mm caffeine for 30 min, washed with DB twice, resuspended at 2 × 107 cells/ml in DB, and kept on ice before assay. Cells were stimulated with 1 μm cAMP, lysed in SDS sample buffer at various time points, and boiled for 5 min. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 4–15% SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and probed with the indicated antibodies. The GFP polyclonal antibody was homemade. All phospho-specific antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology including anti-phospho-PKB substrate antibody (110B7), anti-phospho-PDK docking motif antibody (18A2), anti-phospho-protein kinase C (pan) antibody (190D10). Differentiated cells were plated on a chambered coverglass (Lab-Tek, Nalgen Nunc) and allowed to adhere to the surface. A micropipette filled with 10 μm cAMP was placed into the field of view. The response of the cells was recorded by time-lapse video every 30 s for 30 min. Chemotactic parameters were analyzed by software packages provided by Y. Xiong and P.A. Iglesias. 3Y. Xiong and P. A. Iglesias, manuscript in submission. “Speed” was calculated as the total length of the track divided by the elapsed time. “Chemotaxis speed” was calculated as the distance (d1 − d2), where d1 and d2 are the start and the end point of the migration path to the micropipette, divided by the elapsed time. “Chemotactic index” was calculated by an instantaneous, weighted chemotaxis index. For each frame, the cosine of the angle between the direction of movement and the direction to the micropipette was determined. These values were weighted according to the length of the movement step and averaged. “Persistence” was calculated as the shortest linear length between the start and end point of the migration path divided by the total length traveled by the cell. Differentiated cells were placed on a chambered coverglass and stimulated at 1 μm cAMP. The images were taken at time-lapse intervals of 2 s for 1 min. For the biochemical translocation assay, differentiated cells were stimulated with 1 μm cAMP and lysed through a 5-μm pore membrane with an equal amount of basal buffer. The membrane-enriched fraction was collected by microcentrifugation. To examine whether PDK homologues in D. discoideum function as the AL kinases, we generated single and double-null mutants of the two PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1) family kinases PdkA (DDB0216243) and PdkB (DDB0216246) in the D. discoideum genome by homologous recombination and examined AL and HM phosphorylations in PkbA and PkbR1. Within the kinase domain, PdkA and PdkB share 52 and 47% identity with mammalian (human) PDK1. Furthermore, like mammalian PDK1, both have a PH domain at the C terminus (Fig. 1A) (20.Mora A. Komander D. van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). As previously shown, in wild-type cells, the phosphorylation levels of PkbR1 and PkbA at Thr309 and Thr278 in the ALs, respectively, increased transiently and subsided within 2 min (Fig. 1B) (9.Kamimura Y. Xiong Y. Iglesias P.A. Hoeller O. Bolourani P. Devreotes P.N. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1034-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In pdkA− cells, these AL phosphorylations of both PkbR1 and PkbA were reduced, whereas in pdkB− cells, there was no significant difference from wild-type cells. However, AL phosphorylation of PkbR1 was further reduced in pdkA−pdkB− cells to only 3% of that in wild-type cells. In contrast, the AL phosphorylation of PkbA was not further reduced in pdkA−pdkB− cells compared with the pdkA− cells. We also examined phosphorylation of the HM of PkbR1 at Thr470 in each of the cell lines. In wild-type cells, HM phosphorylation increased transiently with kinetics similar to the AL phosphorylation. Compared with wild-type, the integrated levels of phosphorylation were 41% in pdkA−, 100% in pdkB− cells, and 5% in pdkA−pdkB− cells. Previously, we found that alanine substitution of the AL phosphorylation site of PkbR1 caused an ∼50% reduction of HM phosphorylation (9.Kamimura Y. Xiong Y. Iglesias P.A. Hoeller O. Bolourani P. Devreotes P.N. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1034-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). To examine the consequences of the reduced AL phosphorylations of PKB kinases, the cell extracts from each of the cell lines were immunoblotted by the anti-phosphorylation-specific PKB substrates antibodies. As previously shown, pp350, pp200, pp180, pp140, pp110, pp90, and pp65/67 comprise substrates of the PKBs (9.Kamimura Y. Xiong Y. Iglesias P.A. Hoeller O. Bolourani P. Devreotes P.N. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1034-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In wild-type cells, phosphorylation in these bands increases rapidly and then subsides within several minutes. The phosphorylation levels of these bands were decreased in accordance with the decreased phosphorylation levels of PkbR1 and PkbA at the AL site. These observations show the importance of AL phosphorylation of the PKBs. To verify the specificity of these defects in AL phosphorylations, PdkA-GFP or PdkB-GFP were ectopically expressed in the pdkA−pdkB− cells. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 1C, PdkA-GFP expression restored the AL phosphorylations of PkbR1 and PkbA to wild-type levels. However, PdkB-GFP only functioned for PkbR1 phosphorylation. This is consistent with the observation that in pdkA−pdkB−versus pdkA− cells, only AL phosphorylation of PkbR1 was further reduced (Fig. 1B). In both cell lines, expression of PdkA-GFP or PdkB-GFP restored the phosphorylations of PKB substrates (Fig. 1C, lower panel). Together, these results show that PdkA is a major AL kinase for PkbR1 and PkbA, and PdkB has a minor activity for PkbR1. The residual signals remaining in the pdkA−pdkB− cells suggest that unknown protein kinases also play a minor role for the AL phosphorylations of PkbR1 and PkbA. Our data suggest that, although PdkA-GFP and PdkB-GFP were overexpressed, this did not cause excessive phosphorylation of the PKBs (compare Fig. 1, B and C and supplemental Fig. S1A). The two proteins were expressed at similar levels and migrated at 125 kDa and 150 kDa, as expected from the calculated molecular weights of PdkA and PdkB, respectively (supplemental Fig. S1A). PdkB-GFP itself is apparently a PKB substrate, as the overexpressed protein showed up as a heavily phosphorylated additional band at 150 kDa in the PKB substrate profile (Fig. 1C and see below). It should be noted that cells overexpressing PkbR1 showed a significant increase of AL phosphorylation of PkbR1 (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that PkbR1, not either PDK, is limiting for this phosphorylation event. Both PdkA and PdkB appear to undergo cAMP-induced modifications. First, we noticed that within 1 min after cAMP stimulation, the mobility of PdkA-GFP shifted from an apparent molecular weight of 125 to 140 (Fig. 1D). GFP from cAMP-stimulated, GFP-expressing cells did not show any change in mobility (Fig. 1D). The retardation typically subsided by 5 min after stimulation, but it was maintained persistently in the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol, which inhibits extracellular phosphodiesterase (supplemental Fig. S1B). Taken together, these results show that the modifications of PdkA are regulated by cAMP and do not display adaptation. Second, while PdkB-GFP did not show an apparent mobility shift, as noted above, strong staining with the anti-phosphorylation-specific PKB substrates antibodies was observed at ∼150 kDa, specifically in cells expressing PdkB-GFP, and the intensity increased with cAMP stimulation (Fig. 1C, lower panel). This band is phosphorylated PdkB-GFP, as the size corresponded to PdkB-GFP; the band disappeared in the cell extracts after immunodepletion by an anti-GFP antibody (data not shown); and PdkB has a putative PKB phosphorylation motif (RERSST at Thr735) recognized by anti-phosphorylation-specific PKB substrates antibodies. We wondered whether the PDKs were required for the developmental process whereby D. discoideum cells spontaneously aggregate into streams of cells that form a mound, which ultimately transforms into a fruiting body. Since pkbR1− and pkbA−pkbR1− cells arrest at the mound stage, we expected that, as PdkA and PdkB were the AL kinases for the PKBs, they should be also required near this stage of development (9.Kamimura Y. Xiong Y. Iglesias P.A. Hoeller O. Bolourani P. Devreotes P.N. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1034-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 10.Meili R. Ellsworth C. Firtel R.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 708-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). When wild-type cells were placed on a non-nutrient agar, they made streams beginning ∼5 h and finally formed fruiting bodies (Fig. 2A, upper panel). While pdkA− or pdkB− single null cells formed fruiting bodies like wild-type (data not shown), pdkA−pdkB− cells arrested at the mound stage like pkbR1− and pkbA−pkbR1− cells (Fig. 2A, lower panel). Curiously, pdkA−pdkB− cells started to aggregate rather suddenly, without typical streams, at an early development stage (Fig. 2A, lower panel). We have shown that pkbA−pkbR1− cells are defective in the cell-to-cell signal process required for streaming, and these results suggest that pdkA−pdkB− cells are also important in signal relay. 4H. Cai, S. Das, Y. Kamimura, C. A. Parent, and P. N. Devreotes, manuscript in preparation. To confirm whether the phenotypes of pdkA−pdkB− cells depend on PDK activities, the pdkA−pdkB− cells expressing PdkA-GFP were examined. While cells expressing control vector still showed defects in streams and fruiting body formation, the PdkA-GFP-expressing cells reversed the both defects (Fig. 2B). Because pdkA−pdkB− cells had reduced PKB activities and showed similar phenotypes to pkbR1− cells during nutrient deprivation, we expected there would be a defect in their chemotactic activity. Wild-type cells responded to gradients produced at the tip of a micropipette filled with 10 μm cAMP and moved directionally with the usual streams, whereas the chemotaxis of the pdkA−pdkB− cells was impaired (Figs. 3, A and B and supplemental Movies S1 and S2). Compared with wild-type, pdkA−pdkB− cells showed a reduced chemotactic index (0.74 versus 0.32) but a nearly identical speed (Fig. 3C). Also, the mutant cells did not display streams in this assay, again suggesting a defect in signal relay (Fig. 3A). In more magnified images shown in Fig. 3D, wild-type cells had a typical elongated polarized shape, whereas the pdkA−pdkB− cells were less polarized. These defects were not due to impaired development as wild-type and pdkA−pdkB− cells showed similar cAR1 expression profile (data not shown). To show that the chemotaxis defects were specific, we examined the pdkA−pdkB− cells expressing PdkA-GFP. Similar to the pdkA−pdkB− cells, the vector-transfected cells had a reduced chemotactic activity. On the other hand, the PdkA-GFP expressing cells showed significantly better chemotaxis with the appearance of streams (supplemental Fig. S3). Together, these results show that the PDKs are required for chemotaxis, streaming, and progression through the mound stage of development. Next, we investigated PdkA and PdkB localizations using the GFP-fused proteins. In mammalian cells, the PH domain of PDK1 can bind to PIP3 and has an important function for AL phosphorylation, although the localization of PDK1 is controversial (21.Bayascas J.R. Cell. Cycle. 2008; 7: 2978-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). PdkA-GFP was associated with the plasma membrane in chemotaxing cells and also bound to intracellular vesicles in growth stage cells (Figs. 4, B and C). When chemotaxing cells were treated with caffeine to inhibit de novo cAMP production, the basal membrane binding of PdkA-GFP was reduced. Under these conditions, PdkA-GFP transiently translocated to the plasma membrane, peaking within 10 s after cAMP stimulation (Fig. 4E). The translocation of PdkA-GFP was also observed by disrupting cells mechanically and enriching the membrane fraction. PdkA-GFP accumulated in membrane-enriched fraction within 15 s of after addition of chemoattractant and returned to the cytosol by 1 min (Fig. 4F). On the other hand, PdkB-GFP was localized in the cytosol in chemotaxing cells as well as in growth stage (Fig. 4E and data not shown). Moreover, PdkB-GFP did not change its cytosolic localization upon cAMP stimulation (Fig. 4E). To delineate the region that is responsible for the localization and/or translocation of PdkA-GFP as well as the modification of PdkA described earlier, we constructed a series of deletions and assessed their activities. A C-terminal region between residues 477 and 686, including the PH domain, was sufficient for both the basal membrane localization as well as the chemoattractant-induced translocation (Fig. 4, A and C). As a construct carrying only a PH domain (amino acids 588–686) produced punctate fluorescence, probably due to artificial aggregations, we could not further delineate the region. Consistently, an N-terminal region containing the first 483 residues was localized to the cytosol and did not translocate in response to cAMP (Fig. 4B and data not shown). Interestingly, while the mobility of PdkA-GFP shifted during chemoattractant treatment, that of PdkA-(1–483)-GFP was constant (Fig. 4A). Further deletion analysis of PdkA-GFP confirmed that the sites of modification were mainly located between residues 477 and 547 (supplemental Fig. S4). These data suggest that the region containing the PH domain of PdkA is necessary and sufficient for the basal membrane localization and translocation to the membrane as well as the cAMP-induced mobility shift. We used pi3k1−2− cells, previously shown to have greatly decreased PIP3 production, to evaluate the dependence of the localization and translocation of PdkA-GFP on PIP3 (22.Funamoto S. Meili R. Lee S. Parry L. Firtel R.A. Cell. 2002; 109: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 23.Huang Y.E. Iijima M. Parent C.A. Funamoto S. Firtel R.A. Devreotes P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1913-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). While the basal membrane localization still remained in pi3k1−2− cells, the localization on membrane ruffles and/or on the macropinosome-like structures was lost (Fig. 4D). We also found that PdkA-GFP was localized on small unidentified intracellular vesicles. The translocation of PdkA-GFP upon cAMP addition was lost in pi3k1−2− cells when assessed either microscopically or biochemically (data not shown and Fig. 4F). As a control, AL phosphorylations of PkbR1 and PkbA were assessed in the same fractions. Although the AL of PkbR1 was phosphorylated similarly in wild-type and pi3k1−2− cells, the AL phosphorylation of PkbA was disrupted in pi3k1−2− cells. These data are consistent with the previous evidence that ALs of PkbR1 and PkbA are phosphorylated in PIP3-independent and -dependent manners, respectively. These results suggest that PdkA binds to the membrane by two different mechanisms; the basal membrane binding is independent of PIP3, and the localization on membrane ruffles and the macropinosome-like structures and the translocation are dependent on PIP3. To evaluate importance of the PH domain-containing region of PdkA in vivo, the version of PdkA lacking the PH domain (amino acids 1–483), fused with GFP (PdkAΔPH-GFP), was expressed in pdkA−pdkB− cells and the ability to rescue the developmental and biochemical defects was investigated. As previously shown, pdkA−pdkB− cells arrested at the mound stage upon nutrient deprivation. Surprisingly, the expression of PdkAΔPH-GFP could restore fruiting body formation as effectively as wild-type PdkA-GFP (Fig. 5A). To further assess the role of the PH domain, we created a chimeric PdkA containing K98R mutation, which weakens kinase activity, along with the deletion of the PH domain-containing region. In pdkA−pdkB− cells expressing this chimeric PdkA, compared with a version containing K98R alone, fruiting body formation was partially impaired (Fig. 5B). The mutation K98M, predicted to have no ATP-binding activity, completely eliminated fruiting body formation as well as AL phosphorylations (supplemental Fig. S5). Next, we examined the ability of PdkAΔPH-GFP to phosphorylate the AL of PkbR1 and PkbA. Surprisingly, PdkAΔPH-GFP and PdkA-GFP expressing cells displayed the same intensities of bands (Fig. 5C, upper panel). However, in cells expressing the PdkA(K98R) or the chimeric protein, AL phosphorylation of PkbR1 was reduced by 28 or 1.3%, respectively (Fig. 5D). The levels of expression of PdkAΔPH-GFP were slightly higher than those of PdkA-GFP (Fig. 5C, lower panel). These results showed that the PH domain and modifications of PdkA are dispensable for the AL phosphorylations and the fruiting body formation. However, the PH domain-containing region may have a role for PdkA functions when the proteins are expressed endogenously or the kinase domain is impaired. We have shown that PdkA and PdkB are chemoattractant-mediated kinases for PkbA and PkbR1 and that activation of the PKBs, through coordinated phosphorylation on ALs by the PDKs and on HMs by TorC2 have important roles in chemotaxis. We showed previously that PkbA and PkbR1 were heavily dependent on TorC2-catalyzed HM phosphorylation. In this report, we focused on the molecular mechanism of regulation of AL phosphorylation. Assessment of specific PDK-deficient cell lines demonstrated that PdkA is the major AL kinase of PkbR1 and PkbA, that PdkB contributes to phosphorylation of PkbR1, and that additional minor AL-directed activities are present in cells. The pdkA−pdkB− cells were defective in PKB activation and chemotaxis and failed to form proper multicellular structures upon nutrient deprivation. These defects could be largely reversed by expression of PdkA-GFP. This protein localized on the plasma membrane and was additionally recruited by chemotactic stimulation whereas PdkB-GFP was found in the cytosol. The PH domain of PdkA was sufficient for basal localization, which was independent of PI3K, as well as for stimulated recruitment to the membrane, which depended on PI3K. Surprisingly, the PH domain appears to be dispensable for the function of PdkA when the protein is overexpressed, but the PH domain enhances function when the kinase activity of PdkA is compromised. These findings provide further evidence of the significance of the TorC2-PDK-PKB pathway in chemotaxis. The phosphorylation of the highly conserved site within the AL, thought to bring about a conformational change in the molecule, is essential for PKB activity. We have previously shown that the alanine substitution T309A of PkbR1 caused a nearly complete loss of function. However, because phosphomimetic substitutions T309D and T309E were also nonfunctional, we could not conclude that phosphorylation per se had an essential role (9.Kamimura Y. Xiong Y. Iglesias P.A. Hoeller O. Bolourani P. Devreotes P.N. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1034-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Here, we show that pdkA−pdkB− cells display greatly reduced phosphorylation at Thr309 of PkbR1 and Thr278 of PkbA and that kinase activities, assessed by endogenous PKB substrates, are coordinately decreased. Because, as noted above, minor phosphorylations of PkbR1 and PkbA are still present in pdkA−pdkB− cells and there are no PDK homologues other than PdkA and PdkB in the D. discoideum genome, another related kinase can also phosphorylate the ALs. Interestingly, pdkA−pdkB− cells also display decreased HM phosphorylation of PkbR1, consistent with our previously reported observation that T309A in PkbR1 reduced HM phosphorylation by 50% by an unknown mechanism. It is possible that a conformational change caused by AL phosphorylation makes PkbR1 a better substrate for TorC2 or renders the HM resistant to dephosphorylation. Our data suggest that the concomitant phosphorylations at the AL and HM contribute the stable activation of PKBs. Although PdkA and PdkB are structurally very similar, there are key differences in their functions. First, the degree of a contribution to AL phosphorylation is different. Although pdkA− cells show greatly reduced AL phosphorylation of both PKBs, pdkB− cells maintain nearly wild-type levels. However, when PdkA-GFP or PdkB-GFP was ectopically expressed at similar levels in pdkA−pdkB− cells, the AL phosphorylation of PkbR1 was recovered in a similar way. These data suggest that normally PdkA is more highly expressed than PdkB, leading to the corresponding activities for AL phosphorylations of the PKBs in wild-type cells. Second, the specificity for PkbR1 and PkbA differs for the two PDKs. While PdkA can phosphorylate both PkbR1 and PkbA, PdkB only phosphorylates PkbR1. This preference could arise from the respective kinase domains, as the deletion of PH domain of PdkA does not change specificity. Third, while PdkA localizes on the plasma membrane on structures that resemble macropinosomes and on intracellular vesicles, PdkB localizes in the cytosol. These locations could be due differences in the PH domains, as the association of PdkA with the membranous structures depends on its PH domain. Preliminary examination of the binding of the PH domain of PdkA to lipids using phosphatidylinositol phosphate strips has shown only weak interaction with phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidic acid. 5Y. Kamimura and P. N. Devreotes, unpublished results. In pi3k1−2− cells, the macropinosome labeling and the recruitment to the plasma membrane were lost, but the basal association with the membrane and intracellular vesicles remained. The molecule responsible for the basal membrane binding remains to be determined. Mammalian PDK1 can physically interact with SGK1 and S6K, which are in the same family of AGC kinases as PkbR1, via the HM in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (24.Biondi R.M. Kieloch A. Currie R.A. Deak M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4380-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). However, PdkA-GFP or the PH domain of PdkA (477–686)-GFP still localized on the plasma membrane in pkbR1− cells. 6Y. Kamimura and P. N. Devreotes, unpublished data. We have previously shown that phosphorylation of the AL of PkbR1 is strictly dependent on prior HM phosphorylation. This result is reminiscent of the phosphorylation of the ALs of SGK1 and S6K by PDK1 in mammalian cells (20.Mora A. Komander D. van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). In these instances, PDK1 activity requires phosphorylation-dependent binding to the HM via a PDK1-interacting fragment pocket. Important residues in the PDK1-interacting fragment pocket of PDK1 are conserved in PdkA and PdkB. So far, we have not observed a co-immunoprecipitation of PdkA with PkbR1 in a manner dependent on HM phosphorylation. 6Y. Kamimura and P. N. Devreotes, unpublished data. However, a weak interaction might be sufficient to promote the phosphorylation of the AL of PkbR1. Alternatively, phosphorylation of the HM may cause a conformational change in PkbR1 that is a prerequisite for phosphorylation by the PDKs. We previously reported that a version of PkbR1, bearing the phosphomimetic mutation, T470E, at the key site in the HM, was still transiently phosphorylated at Thr309 in the AL in piaA− cells that lack TorC2 activity, implying that the time course of phosphorylation at the AL is not controlled simply by the profile of HM phosphorylation (9.Kamimura Y. Xiong Y. Iglesias P.A. Hoeller O. Bolourani P. Devreotes P.N. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1034-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Rather, it appears that PdkA is transiently activated by chemoattractant stimulation. That is, either the activity of PdkA is regulated or the chemoattractant somehow renders PkbR1 as a better substrate for PdkA. A likely upstream regulator of PdkA-mediated phosphorylation is RasC. When RasC is disrupted, phosphorylation of PkbR1 HM as well as AL is reduced. Furthermore, when constitutively active RasC, RasC(Q62L), is expressed in cells, the phosphorylation of both HM and AL are significantly prolonged.4 The exact molecular mechanism of this regulation of PdkA by RasC awaits for further investigation. Since we showed here that PdkA lacking a PH domain still functions, another portion of the molecule including a kinase domain is regulated upon stimulation. We have shown that the PH domain of PdkA is dispensable but may enhance the function of the enzyme under certain conditions. The lack of requirement for the PH domain is unexpected but might be consistent with the results from a knock-in mouse of a PH domain mutant of PDK1 that cannot bind to PIP3. Cells from these mice showed reduced AL phosphorylation of AKT, but 35% of the activity was still remaining, suggesting that the PH domain of PDK1 is important but not essential for function (25.Bayascas J.R. Wullschleger S. Sakamoto K. García-Martínez J.M. Clacher C. Komander D. van Aalten D.M. Boini K.M. Lang F. Lipina C. Logie L. Sutherland C. Chudek J.A. van Diepen J.A. Voshol P.J. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 3258-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The pdkA−pdkB− cells displayed physiological defects that closely resembled those of cells lacking PKB activity. The pdkA−pdkB− cells arrested at the multicellular “mound stage” of development, like the pkbR1− cells and the pkbA−pkbR1− cells (9.Kamimura Y. Xiong Y. Iglesias P.A. Hoeller O. Bolourani P. Devreotes P.N. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1034-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 10.Meili R. Ellsworth C. Firtel R.A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 708-717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). They were also defective in chemotaxis like the pkbR1− cells (9.Kamimura Y. Xiong Y. Iglesias P.A. Hoeller O. Bolourani P. Devreotes P.N. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1034-1043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These data suggest that PdkA and PdkB function mainly through PkbR1 and PkbA in the early differentiation phase even though other AGC family kinases are present in D. discoideum cells. These similarities are consistent with the levels of AL phosphorylation observed in each of the strains. However, the defective phenotypes were not exactly the same in pdkA−pdkB− cells and pkbR1− or pkbA−pkbR1− cells. First, the chemotaxis defect, based on the chemotaxis index, in pkbR1− cells appeared stronger than that in pdkA−pdkB− cells. Second, although pkbR1− cells maintained a polarized shape during chemotaxis, pdkA−pdkB− cells were less polarized. Third, the pkbA−pkbR1− cells did not grow in liquid media without addition of killed bacteria, but pdkA−pdkB− cells did. These differences might be due to slightly different remaining levels of PKB activities and different thresholds of each biological event for PKB activity. It would be interesting to compare the phenotypes of pkbA−pkbR1− cells with the cells that completely lack AL phosphorylations of these PKBs. These findings firmly establish that the TorC2-PDK-PKB pathway plays an important role in regulating directed cell migration. This model implies that regulated phosphorylation of a series of specific PKB substrates would regulate directed migration. We have previously identified six of the proteins that are targets of the TorC2-PDK-PKB pathway. This hypothesis is quite distinct from many other theories about how chemoattractants link to the cytoskeleton. The multiple points of regulation in the TorC2-PDK-PKB pathway make this pathway well suited to confine signaling to the leading edge of cells as we have previously reported. It is interesting that the TorC2-PDK-PKB module, known widely for its role in regulating cell growth transitions, also plays a prominent role in directed migration. It is possible that early phosphorylation events triggered by chemoattractants regulate migration and that subsequent phosphorylation of the other substrates regulates cell growth.

https://openalex.org/W1997214852,"Members of the Ty3-Gypsy retrotransposon family are rare in mammalian genomes despite their abundance in invertebrates and some vertebrates. These elements contain a gag-pol-like structure characteristic of retroviruses but have lost their ability to retrotranspose into the mammalian genome and are thought to be inactive relics of ancient retrotransposition events. One of these retrotransposon-like elements, PEG11 (also called RTL1) is located at the distal end of ovine chromosome 18 within an imprinted gene cluster that is highly conserved in placental mammals. The region contains several conserved imprinted genes including BEGAIN, DLK1, DAT, GTL2 (MEG3), PEG11 (RTL1), PEG11as, MEG8, MIRG and DIO3. An intergenic point mutation between DLK1 and GTL2 causes muscle hypertrophy in callipyge sheep and is associated with large changes in expression of the genes linked in cis between DLK1 and MEG8. It has been suggested that over-expression of DLK1 is the effector of the callipyge phenotype; however, PEG11 gene expression is also strongly correlated with the emergence of the muscling phenotype as a function of genotype, muscle type and developmental stage. To date, there has been no direct evidence that PEG11 encodes a protein, especially as its anti-sense transcript (PEG11as) contains six miRNA that cause cleavage of the PEG11 transcript. Using immunological and mass spectrometry approaches we have directly identified the full-length PEG11 protein from postnatal nuclear preparations of callipyge skeletal muscle and conclude that its over-expression may be involved in inducing muscle hypertrophy. The developmental expression pattern of the PEG11 gene is consistent with the callipyge mutation causing recapitulation of the normal fetal-like gene expression program during postnatal development. Analysis of the PEG11 sequence indicates strong conservation of the regions encoding the antisense microRNA and in at least two cases these correspond with structural or functional domains of the protein suggesting co-evolution of the sense and antisense genes."
https://openalex.org/W2070804167,"Background IL-24 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene-7 (mda-7)), a member of the IL-10 cytokine family, possesses the properties of a classical cytokine as well as tumor suppressor effects. The exact role of IL-24 in the immune system has not been defined but studies have indicated a role for IL-24 in inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis. The tumor suppressor effects of IL-24 include inhibition of angiogenesis, sensitization to chemotherapy, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-mediated apoptosis. Current knowledge on the regulation of IL-24 expression is sparse. Previous studies have suggested that mRNA stabilization is of major importance to IL-24 expression. Yet, the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of IL-24 mRNA stability remain unidentified. As p38 MAPK is known to regulate gene expression by interfering with mRNA degradation we examined the role of p38 MAPK in the regulation of IL-24 gene expression in cultured normal human keratinocytes. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study we show that anisomycin- and IL-1β- induced IL-24 expression is strongly dependent on p38 MAPK activation. Studies of IL-24 mRNA stability in anisomycin-treated keratinocytes reveal that the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB 202190 accelerates IL-24 mRNA decay suggesting p38 MAPK to regulate IL-24 expression by mRNA-stabilizing mechanisms. The insertion of the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of IL-24 mRNA in a tet-off reporter construct induces degradation of the reporter mRNA. The observed mRNA degradation is markedly reduced when a constitutively active mutant of MAPK kinase 6 (MKK6), which selectively activates p38 MAPK, is co-expressed. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, we here report p38 MAPK as a regulator of IL-24 expression and determine interference with destabilization mediated by the 3′ UTR of IL-24 mRNA as mode of action. As discussed in the present work these findings have important implications for our understanding of IL-24 as a tumor suppressor protein as well as an immune modulating cytokine."
https://openalex.org/W1988903139,"Here we demonstrate that the neuropeptide hormone thyrotropin (TSH), which controls thyroid hormone production, exerts a major nonclassical function in mitochondrial biology. Based on transcriptional, ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, and biochemical evidence, TSH up-regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and consequently activity in organ-cultured normal human epidermis in situ. Mitochondrial activity was assessed by measuring 2 key components of the respiratory chain. The abundance of mitochondria was assessed employing 2 independent morphological techniques: counting their numbers in human epidermis by high-magnification light microscopy of skin sections immunostained for mitochondria-selective cytochrome-c-oxidase subunit 1 (MTCO1) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Treatment with 10 mU/ml of TSH for 6 d strongly up-regulates the number of light-microscopically visualized, MTCO1-demarcated mitochondria. On the ultrastructural level, TEM confirms that TSH indeed stimulates mitochondrial proliferation and biogenesis in the perinuclear region of human skin epidermal keratinocytes. On the transcriptional level, TSH up-regulates MTCO1 mRNA (quantitative RT-PCR) and significantly enhances complex I and IV (cytochrome-c-oxidase) activity. This study pioneers the concept that mitochondrial energy metabolism and biogenesis in a normal, prototypic human epithelial tissue underlies potent neuroendocrine controls and introduces human skin organ culture as a clinically relevant tool for further exploring this novel research frontier in the control of mitochondrial biology."
https://openalex.org/W2010061601,"A complete understanding of negative selection has been elusive due to the rapid apoptosis and clearance of thymocytes in vivo. We report a TCR transgenic model in which expression of the TCR during differentiation occurs only after V(D)J-like recombination. TCR expression from this transgene closely mimics expression of the endogenous TCRalpha locus allowing for development that is similar to wild type thymocytes. This model allowed us to characterize the phenotypic changes that occurred after TCR-mediated signaling in self-reactive thymocytes prior to their deletion in a highly physiological setting. Self-reactive thymocytes were identified as being immature, activated and CD4(lo)CD8(lo). These cells had upregulated markers of negative selection and were apoptotic. Elimination of Bim reduced the apoptosis of self-reactive thymocytes, but it did not rescue their differentiation and the cells remained at the immature CD4(lo)CD8(lo) stage of development. These cells upregulate Nur77 and do not contribute to the peripheral T cell repertoire in vivo. Remarkably, development past the CD4(lo)CD8(lo) stage was possible once the cells were removed from the negatively selecting thymic environment. In vitro development of these cells occurred despite their maintenance of high intracellular levels of Nur77. Therefore, in vivo, negatively selected Bim-deficient thymocytes are eliminated after prolonged developmental arrest via a Bim-independent pathway that is dependent on the thymic microenvironment. These data newly reveal a layering of immediate, Bim-dependent, and delayed Bim-independent pathways that both contribute to elimination of self-reactive thymocytes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2001563463,"Background Prevalence estimates of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) among HIV-infected women in India have been based on cervical cytology, which may have underestimated true disease burden. We sought to better establish prevalence estimates and evaluate risk factors of CIN among HIV-infected women in Pune, India using colposcopy and histopathology as diagnostic tools. Methodology Previously unscreened, non-pregnant HIV-infected women underwent cervical cancer screening evaluation including standardized diagnostic colposcopy by a gynecologist. Histopathologic confirmation was conducted among consenting women with clinical suspicion of CIN. The prevalence of CIN was evaluated by a composite diagnosis based on colposcopy and histopathology results. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine independent predictors of increasing severity of CIN. Results The median age of the n = 303 enrolled HIV-infected women was 30 years (interquartile range, 27–34). A majority of the participants were widowed or separated (187/303, 61.7%), more than one-third (114/302, 37.7%) were not educated beyond primary school, and nearly two-thirds (196/301, 64.7%) had a family per capita income of <1,000 Indian Rupees (∼US$22) per month. Cervical high-risk HPV-DNA was detected in 41.7% (124/297) of participants. The composite colposcopic-histopathologic diagnoses revealed no evidence of CIN in 220 out of 303 (72.6%) women, CIN1 in 33/303 (10.9%), CIN2 in 31/303 (10.2%), CIN3 in 18/303 (5.9%) and 1 (0.3%) woman was diagnosed with ICC. Thus, over a quarter of the participants [83/303: 27.7% (95% CI: 22.7–33.1)] had ≥CIN1 lesions and a sixth [50/303: 16.5% (95% CI: 12.2–21.9)] had evidence of advanced (≥CIN2) neoplastic disease. The independent predictors of increasing severity of CIN as revealed by a proportional odds model using multivariable ordinal logistic regression included (i) currently receiving antiretroviral therapy [adjusted odds ratios (aOR): 2.24 (1.17, 4.26), p = 0.01] and (ii) presence of cervical high-risk HPV-DNA [aOR: 1.93 (1.13, 3.28), p = 0.02]. Conclusions HIV-infected women in Pune, India have a substantial burden of cervical precancerous lesions, which may progress to invasive cervical cancer unless appropriately detected and treated. Increased attention should focus on recognizing and addressing this entirely preventable cancer among HIV-infected women, especially in the context of increasing longevity due to antiretroviral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2013211792,"Irgm1 (LRG-47) is an interferon-inducible Golgi membrane associated GTPase of the mouse whose disruption causes susceptibility to many different intracellular pathogens. Irgm1 has been variously interpreted as a regulator of homologous effector GTPases of the IRG family, a regulator of phagosome maturation and as an initiator of autophagy in interferon-induced cells. We find that endogenous Irgm1 localises to late endosomal and lysosomal compartments in addition to the Golgi membranes. The targeting motif known to be required for Golgi localisation is surprisingly also required for endolysosomal localisation. However, unlike Golgi localisation, localisation to the endolysosomal system also requires the functional integrity of the nucleotide binding site, and thus probably reflects transient activation. Golgi localisation is lost when Irgm1 is tagged at either N- or C-termini with EGFP, while localisation to the endolysosomal system is relatively favoured. N-terminally tagged Irgm1 localises predominantly to early endosomes, while C-terminally tagged Irgm1 localises to late endosomes and lysosomes. Both these anomalous distributions are reversed by inactivation of the nucleotide binding site, and the tagged proteins both revert to Golgi membrane localisation. Irgm1 is the first IRG protein to be found associated with the endolysosomal membrane system in addition to either Golgi (Irgm1 and Irgm2) or ER (Irgm3) membranes, and we interpret the result to be in favour of a regulatory function of IRGM proteins at cellular membrane systems. In future analyses it should be borne in mind that tagging of Irgm1 leads to loss of Golgi localisation and enhanced localisation on endolysosomal membranes, probably as a result of constitutive activation."
https://openalex.org/W2058401562,"Mitochondria can sense signals linked to variations in energy demand to regulate nuclear gene expression. This retrograde signaling pathway is presumed to be involved in the regulation of myoblast proliferation and differentiation. Rhabdomyosarcoma cells are characterized by their failure to both irreversibly exit the cell cycle and complete myogenic differentiation. However, it is currently unknown whether mitochondria are involved in the failure of rhabdomyosarcoma cells to differentiate.Mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolism were studied in rat L6E9 myoblasts and R1H rhabdomyosacoma cells during the cell cycle and after 36 hours of differentiation. Using a combination of flow cytometry, polarographic and molecular analyses, we evidenced a marked decrease in the cardiolipin content of R1H cells cultured in growth and differentiation media, together with a significant increase in the content of mitochondrial biogenesis factors and mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins. Altogether, these data indicate that the mitochondrial inner membrane composition and the overall process of mitochondrial biogenesis are markedly altered in R1H cells. Importantly, the dysregulation of protein-to-cardiolipin ratio was associated with major deficiencies in both basal and maximal mitochondrial respiration rates. This deficiency in mitochondrial respiration probably contributes to the inability of R1H cells to decrease mitochondrial H2O2 level at the onset of differentiation.A defect in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial metabolism may thus be an epigenetic mechanism that may contribute to the tumoral behavior of R1H cells. Our data underline the importance of mitochondria in the regulation of myogenic differentiation."

We have recently demonstrated that immunization with Salmonella enterica Typhimurium expressing the VapA antigen protects mice against R. equi infection. We now report that oral vaccination of mice with this recombinant strain results in high and persistent fecal levels of antigen-specific IgA, and specific proliferation of the spleen cells of immunized mice in response to the in vitro stimulation with R. equi antigen. After in vitro stimulation, spleen cells of immunized mice produce high levels of Th1 cytokines and show a prominent mRNA expression of the Th1 transcription factor T-bet, in detriment of the Th2 transcription factor GATA-3. Following R. equi challenge, a high H2O2, NO, IL-12, and IFN-γ content is detected in the organs of immunized mice. On the other hand, TNF-α and IL-4 levels are markedly lower in the organs of vaccinated mice, compared with the non-vaccinated ones. The IL-10 content and the mRNA transcription level of TGF-β are also higher in the organs of immunized mice. A greater incidence of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and B lymphocytes is verified in vaccinated mice. However, there is no difference between vaccinated and non-vaccinated mice in terms of the frequency of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells. Finally, we show that the vaccination confers a long-term protection against R. equi infection. Altogether, these data indicate that the oral vaccination of mice with S. enterica Typhimurium expressing VapA induces specific and long-lasting humoral and cellular responses against the pathogen, which are appropriately regulated and allow tissue integrity after challenge."

https://openalex.org/W2136207455,"Familial hemophagocytosis (FHL) is a rare disease associated with defects in proteins involved in CD8+ T-cell cytotoxicity. Hyperactivation of immune cells results in a perilous, Th1-driven cytokine storm. We set out to explore the regulation of cytokines in an FHL patient who was clinically stable on low-dose immunosuppressive therapy after bone marrow transplantation over a six-month period. During this period, chimerism analyses showed that the fraction of host cells was between 1 and 10%. Both parents of the patient as well as healthy volunteers were studied for comparison.Using ELISA, quantitative real-time PCR, and clinical laboratory methods, we investigated constitutive and inducible cytokines, polymorphisms, and clinical parameters in whole blood and whole blood cultures. Although routine laboratory tests were within the normal range, the chemokines IP-10 and IL-8 as well as the cytokine IL-27p28 were increased up to 10-fold under constitutive and stimulated conditions compared to healthy controls. Moreover, high levels of IFNgamma and TNFalpha were produced upon stimulation. Unexpectedly, IFNgamma induction of IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP) was markedly reduced (1.6-fold vs 5-fold in controls). The patient's mother featured intermediately increased cytokine levels, whereas levels in the father were similar to those in the controls.Since IL-18 plays a major role in perpetuating hemophagocytosis, the failure of IFNgamma to induce IL-18BP may constitute a fundamental pathogenetic mechanism. Furthermore, increased production of IL-8 and IL-27 appears to be associated with this disease. Such dysregulation of cytokines was also found in the heterozygous parents, providing a novel insight into genotype-phenotype correlation of FHL which may encourage future research of this rare disease."
https://openalex.org/W2023481414,"Background Vietnam is one of the countries most affected by outbreaks of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. First identified in Vietnam in poultry in 2001 and in humans in 2004, the virus has since caused 111 cases and 56 deaths in humans. In 2003/2004 H5N1 outbreaks, nearly the entire poultry population of Vietnam was culled. Our earlier study (Wan et al., 2008, PLoS ONE, 3(10): e3462) demonstrated that there have been at least six independent H5N1 introductions into Vietnam and there were nine newly emerged reassortants from 2001 to 2007 in Vietnam. H5N1 viruses in Vietnam cluster distinctly around Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. However, the nature of the relationship between genetic divergence and geographic patterns is still unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we hypothesized that genetic distances between H5N1 viruses in Vietnam are correlated with geographic distances, as the result of distinct population and environment patterns along Vietnam's long north to south longitudinal extent. Based on this hypothesis, we combined spatial statistical methods with genetic analytic techniques and explicitly used geographic space to explore genetic evolution of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses at the sub-national scale in Vietnam. Our dataset consisted of 125 influenza viruses (with whole genome sets) isolated in Vietnam from 2003 to 2007. Our results document the significant effect of space and time on genetic evolution and the rise of two regional centers of genetic mixing by 2007. These findings give insight into processes underlying viral evolution and suggest that genetic differentiation is associated with the distance between concentrations of human and poultry populations around Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Conclusions/Significance The results show that genetic evolution of H5N1 viruses in Vietnamese domestic poultry is highly correlated with the location and spread of those viruses in geographic space. This correlation varies by scale, time, and gene, though a classic isolation by distance pattern is observed. This study is the first to characterize the geographic structure of influenza viral evolution at the sub-national scale in Vietnam and can shed light on how H5N1 HPAIVs evolve in certain geographic settings."

All mitochondrial cytochrome bc1 complexes contain three essential subunits that house four redox prosthetic groups and seven to eight non-redox prosthetic groups containing supernumerary subunits. The three essential subunits are: the cytochrome b subunit, housing two b-type hemes (bH and bL); the cytochrome c1 subunit, housing one c-type heme (c1); the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (ISP), 2The abbreviations used are: ISPiron-sulfur proteinMDHmalate dehydrogenaseOAAoxaloacetateSulfo-SBEDsulfosuccinimidyl-2-[6-(biotinamido)-2-(p-azidobenzamido) hexanoamido]ethyl-1,3′-dithiopropionateSulfo-NHSsulfonated N-hydroxysuccinimideQ0C10BrH22,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-(10-bromodecyl)-1,4-benzoquinolMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightMPmatrix protein. housing a high potential [2Fe-2S] cluster.Although the structural and functional studies of the mitochondrial bc1 complex have been intensive, few studies of the interactions between the bc1 complex and the soluble matrix enzymes have been available. Complex II (succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) is the only enzyme that participates in both the citric acid cycle and the electron transport chain (12.Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9424-9431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Complex II is composed of a succinate dehydrogenase, which is a citric acid cycle enzyme, and a membrane-anchoring protein fraction, which houses ubiquinone. Complex II catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate and the reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol. Other enzymes of citric acid cycle are known to couple to the electron transfer chain through their product NADH at complex I (13.Ovádi J. Huang Y. Spivey H.O. J. Mol. Recognit. 1994; 7: 265-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Structurally the mitochondrial bc1 complex can be divided into three regions: matrix, transmembrane, and the intermembrane space regions. The matrix region contains subunits I (core I), II (core II), VI, IX, and the N-terminal part of subunits V (ISP) and VII (2.Xia D. Yu C.A. Kim H. Xia J.Z. Kachurin A.M. Zhang L. Yu L. Deisenhofer J.

Science. 1998; 281: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). Although this region contains the major part of the complex mass, it possesses no redox centers; it is not directly involved in electron/proton transfer activity. The functions of subunits in this region, although mostly unknown, may contribute to a structural or regulatory role of the bc1 complex. Indeed, the recent structural studies of a supercomplex formed from complexes I and III indicate that the matrix part of complex III is required for its association with complex I (14.Dudkina N.V. Eubel H. Keegstra W. Boekema E.J. Braun H.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3225-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The matrix region of Complex III may also be important for stabilization of the complex itself as bc1 complexes without core proteins are generally less stable and have lower activity (15.Tso S.C. Yin Y. Yu C.A. Yu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 1561-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). If the interaction between the matrix enzymes and the bc1 complex exists, this region would be a good choice for the contact.It also should be noted that core I and core II subunits of the bovine complex have mitochondrial processing peptidase-like activity (16.Deng K.

The cleaved presequence peptide is then bound to core I and core II as subunit IX during maturation of the complex and, thus, inhibits the mitochondrial processing peptidase activity. Because the binding of subunit IX inhibits the mitochondrial processing peptidase activity of core I and core II, these two core subunits act like a suicide peptidase.In the present work we have observed an increase in bc1 activity when the bc1 complex was incubated with the mitochondrial-soluble matrix protein fraction, suggesting that an interaction between the electron transfer complex and the matrix enzymes exists. To confirm this suggestion, we developed a technique to pull down the interacting matrix proteins. This technique involves incubation of the purified, detergent-dispersed bc1 complex with the soluble matrix enzyme fraction followed by extensive dialysis and centrifugation to collect the precipitates that contain the matrix enzymes and the bc1 complex.

In the recent years, a particular kind of post-mortem DNA modification giving rise to nucleotide misincorporation (""miscoding lesions"") has been the object of extensive investigations.To improve our knowledge regarding the nature and incidence of ancient DNA nucleotide misincorporations, we have utilized 6,859 (629,975 bp) mitochondrial (mt) DNA sequences obtained from the 5,350-5,100-years-old, freeze-desiccated human mummy popularly known as the Tyrolean Iceman or Otzi. To generate the sequences, we have applied a mixed PCR/pyrosequencing procedure allowing one to obtain a particularly high sequence coverage. As a control, we have produced further 8,982 (805,155 bp) mtDNA sequences from a contemporary specimen using the same system and starting from the same template copy number of the ancient sample. From the analysis of the nucleotide misincorporation rate in ancient, modern, and putative contaminant sequences, we observed that the rate of misincorporation is significantly lower in modern and putative contaminant sequence datasets than in ancient sequences. In contrast, type 2 transitions represent the vast majority (85%) of the observed nucleotide misincorporations in ancient sequences.This study provides a further contribution to the knowledge of nucleotide misincorporation patterns in DNA sequences obtained from freeze-preserved archeological specimens. In the Iceman system, ancient sequences can be clearly distinguished from contaminants on the basis of nucleotide misincorporation rates. This observation confirms a previous identification of the ancient mummy sequences made on a purely phylogenetical basis. The present investigation provides further indication that the majority of ancient DNA damage is reflected by type 2 (cytosine-->thymine/guanine-->adenine) transitions and that type 1 transitions are essentially PCR artifacts."
https://openalex.org/W2066981042,"When rates of uptake of other drugs differ between treatment arms in long-term trials, the true benefit or harm of the treatment may be underestimated. Methods to allow for such contamination have often been limited by failing to preserve the randomization comparisons. In the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study, patients were randomized to fenofibrate or placebo, but during the trial many started additional drugs, particularly statins, more so in the placebo group. The effects of fenofibrate estimated by intention-to-treat were likely to have been attenuated. We aimed to quantify this effect and to develop a method for use in other long-term trials.We applied efficacies of statins and other cardiovascular drugs from meta-analyses of randomized trials to adjust the effect of fenofibrate in a penalized Cox model. We assumed that future cardiovascular disease events were reduced by an average of 24% by statins, and 20% by a first other major cardiovascular drug. We applied these estimates to each patient who took these drugs for the period they were on them. We also adjusted the analysis by the rate of discontinuing fenofibrate. Among 4,900 placebo patients, average statin use was 16% over five years. Among 4,895 assigned fenofibrate, statin use was 8% and nonuse of fenofibrate was 10%. In placebo patients, use of cardiovascular drugs was 1% to 3% higher. Before adjustment, fenofibrate was associated with an 11% reduction in coronary events (coronary heart disease death or myocardial infarction) (P = 0.16) and an 11% reduction in cardiovascular disease events (P = 0.04). After adjustment, the effects of fenofibrate on coronary events and cardiovascular disease events were 16% (P = 0.06) and 15% (P = 0.008), respectively.This novel application of a penalized Cox model for adjustment of a trial estimate of treatment efficacy incorporates evidence-based estimates for other therapies, preserves comparisons between the randomized groups, and is applicable to other long-term trials. In the FIELD study example, the effects of fenofibrate on the risks of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease events were underestimated by up to one-third in the original analysis.Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN64783481."

Discov. 2002; 1: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (2683) Google Scholar). The physiological role of GPCRs is directly linked to the activation of heterotrimeric Gαβγ proteins (3.Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Upon agonist binding, GPCRs become active and promote G protein activation by catalyzing GDP to GTP exchange at the Gα subunit (4.Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4728) Google Scholar). During interaction with active receptors, the affinity of GDP-bound G proteins toward GDP is lowered and a transient complex of agonist-bound receptor and nucleotide-free G protein may be formed (5.Kagawa H. Asai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7106-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Efficient binding of GTP to the Gα subunit is based on the excess of intracellular GTP over GDP (6.Heck M. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10000-10009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Finally, active GTP-bound G proteins dissociate from active receptors, thus promoting G protein/effector interactions (7.Oldham W.M. Hamm H.E. Nat. Rev. Mol.

There are several models of receptor-G protein interaction. The model of collision coupling assumes conditions of free lateral diffusion in the cell membrane (8.Lefkowitz R.J. De Lean A. Hoffman B.B.

The model of collision coupling would allow a “reversed G protein activation”: interaction of heterotrimeric active G proteins with active receptors, receptor-catalyzed release of GTP from Gα, and consequent G protein deactivation. In computational G protein models, however, such a reaction was neglected (12.Bornheimer S.J. Maurya M.R. Farquhar M.G. Subramaniam S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15899-15904Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Hints for an agonist-induced release of GTP and a deactivation of G proteins have been described independently by several groups: An exchange of GTPγS and Gpp(NH)p to other nucleotides by active receptors was reported (13.Hilf G. Kupprion C. Wieland T. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, G protein-activated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels (14.Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E.

Recently established methods of fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) allow for direct investigation of receptor-G protein interactions and G protein activation (18.Janetopoulos C. Jin T.

Using these methods in conjunction with permeabilization of the cell membrane, we tested the hypothesis, that in intact cells activated G proteins interact with active receptors and become subsequently deactivated due to release of GTP. Measurement of G protein activation by means of FRET was performed by transient transfection of cDNA/5-cm dish (in micrograms): Gαo-(91)YFP (1.8), Gβ1 (0.5), and CFP-Gγ2 (0.2) as described (20.Frank M.

GIRK currents were measured in clone I by transient transfection of cDNA/5-cm dish (in micrograms): GIRK1/4 (0.4), Gαo or Gαo-(91)YFP (1.8), and mGFP (0.2). Coexpression of Gαo was chosen for consistent experimental conditions and to minimize basal GIRK channel activation, thereby preventing death of transfected cells prior to analysis. FRET-based detection of receptor-G protein interactions was performed by transient transfection of cDNA/5-cm dish (in micrograms): Gαo (1.8), Gβ1 (0.5), CFP-Gγ2 (0.2), and α2A-AR-YFP (0.5) in a HEK293T cell as described before (21.Hein P. Frank M. Hoffmann C. Lohse M.J. Bünemann M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4106-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and illustrated in Fig. 1B. All transfections were performed using the Effectene transfection kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen). Transfected cells growing on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were mounted on a dual-emission photometric microscope, and FRET was measured as described (19.Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl.

FRET was calculated ratiometrically by dividing spillover-corrected YFP emission by CFP emission (19.Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To permeabilize cells attached to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, incubation with internal buffer containing 0.05% saponine for 1 min, was performed, and cells were subsequently washed with internal buffer in experiments shown in Fig. 3–6. Confocal images were taken using a Leica TCS SP5 system, similar to those of a previous study (21.Hein P. Frank M. Hoffmann C. Lohse M.J. Bünemann M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4106-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Whole cell, patch clamp recordings for experiments shown in Fig. 2 were performed in the presence of 20 mm extracellular K+ to measure GIRK currents at −90 mV membrane potential in an inward direction as described before (22.Bünemann M. Bücheler M.M. Philipp M. Lohse M.J. Hein L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47512-47517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All solutions were applied using a rapid superfusion device (20.Frank M. Thümer L. Lohse M.J. Bünemann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24584-24590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) that allowed for solution exchange times within 10 ms. G protein activation in FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6 was normalized to the maximum level of G protein activation (defined as steady-state FRET in the presence of internal buffer containing 0.1 μm noradrenaline (NA) and 1 μm GTPγS) and normalized to the minimum level of G protein activation (defined as steady-state FRET during superfusion with internal buffer containing 100 μm NA without nucleotides). Receptor-G protein interactions in Fig. 4 were normalized to the maximum levels of receptor-G protein interactions (defined as steady-state FRET in the presence of 100 μm NA without nucleotides) and minimum levels of receptor-G protein interactions (defined as steady-state FRET in the presence of internal buffer containing nucleotide but no NA). Only experiments free of non-linear shifts were analyzed. Intact cells (in both FRET and patch clamp experiments) were continuously superfused with external buffer containing (in mm): NaCl 124, KCl 20, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, HEPES 10 at pH 7.35, and NA as indicated. Permeabilized cells were continuously superfused with internal buffer containing (in mm): K+-aspartate 100, KCl 30, NaCl 10, MgCl2 1, EGTA 5, HEPES 10 at pH 7.35, NA, and nucleotides as indicated. Patch clamp pipettes were filled with a buffer containing (in mm): K+-aspartate 100, KCl 40, MgCl2 1, EGTA 5, Na+-ATP 2.5, Na+-GTP 0.03, HEPES 10 at pH 7.35. All buffers were calibrated to 330 mosm using KCl. All chemicals were from Sigma or AppliChem. GTPγ35S binding was performed as described previously (23.Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of cell membrane of HEK293 cells stably expressing α2A-AR (clone I) were incubated with 3 × 105 cpm GTPγ35S in a binding buffer containing (in mm) 20 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 100 NaCl, 1 EDTA, and 1 dithiothreitol at pH 7.4 with 0.1 μm NA at room temperature in a total volume of 4 ml. Upon steady-state binding of GTPγ35S (determined to occur within 10 min of incubation), the reaction batch was split into two groups. Group 1 was additionally incubated with 1 mm rauwolscine and 100 μm GTPγS, group 2 with 100 μm NA and 100 μm GTPγS. GTPγ35S binding at each indicated time point was assessed by filtration of 2 × 200 μl of the reaction batch on GF/F filters after washing four times with 5 ml of binding buffer and resuspension in 8 ml of Lumasafe Plus (PELAS) buffer. Radioactivity was determined using a Beckman LS-1801 counter. HEK293 cells were disrupted with an Ultra-Turrax cell disrupter, and crude cell membrane preparations were obtained by centrifugation of the lysate at 1,200 × g followed by centrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000 × g. Pellets were resuspended in resuspension buffer (5 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA). Proteins were solubilized in SDS-sample buffer and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. Equal amounts of total protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Bound proteins were probed with polyclonal anti-Gαo/Gαi3 antibodies (Calbiochem), followed by peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Dianova). Signal detection was performed with an ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection Reagent (Amersham Biosciences) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, and signals were recorded on a LAS-1000 imaging system and quantified with Multi Gauge software (Fuji). If not indicated otherwise, all data are given as mean and standard error of the mean. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test and Origin 7.5b (OriginLab). Ordinary concentration-response curves were fitted using PRISM 4.0 (GraphPad Software Inc.). Strong stimulation of adenosine A1 receptors coexpressed in atrial myocytes (16.Bösche L.I. Wellner-Kienitz M.C. Bender K. Pott L. J. Physiol. 2003; 550: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or HEK293 cells (17.Leaney J.L. Benians A. Brown S. Nobles M. Kelly D. Tinker A. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C182-C191Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was reported not only to activate but also to paradoxically attenuate preactivated GIRK currents. We hypothesized that this attenuation reflects an inactivation of G proteins by high levels of active GPCRs. Therefore, GIRK currents and G protein activation were assessed in an HEK293 cell line, stably expressing α2A-adrenergic receptors (α2A-AR) at 19.9 pmol/mg (clone I). Based on comparative confocal fluorescence measurements, radioligand binding, and immunoblotting, we estimated the expression of α2A-AR and Gαo to be 3:1 for these conditions (supplemental Fig. S1). The Ki of NA binding to the α2A-AR is in the order of 5 μm (22.Bünemann M. Bücheler M.M. Philipp M. Lohse M.J. Hein L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47512-47517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). GIRK currents were maximal upon stimulation of transfected cells with 0.1 μm NA. Upon stimulation with 100 μm NA, GIRK currents rapidly decreased to an attenuated steady state. When NA was washed out, GIRK currents were quickly reactivated to a level as elicited by stimulation with 0.1 μm NA (Fig. 2A). A concentration-response curve with a −log EC50 of 5.5 ± 0.04 (Fig. 2C, black trace, n = 7) was obtained, when the GIRK current attenuation at 1 μm, 3 μm, and 10 μm NA was normalized to the attenuation observed at 100 μm NA (Fig. 2B). This result corresponded with the binding affinity of NA toward the α2A-AR (22.Bünemann M. Bücheler M.M. Philipp M. Lohse M.J. Hein L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47512-47517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We next tested whether a corresponding NA-induced attenuation could also be detected on the level of G protein activation. G protein activation was monitored by means of FRET between YFP-tagged Gαo and CFP-tagged Gγ2-subunits (19.Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1A, FRET between tagged Gαo and Gγ2 becomes less efficient upon receptor-mediated activation of G proteins (20.Frank M. Thümer L. Lohse M.J. Bünemann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24584-24590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), consistent with either dissociation or conformational rearrangement of G protein subunits. G protein activation paralleled the activation of GIRK currents: FRET decreased maximally upon stimulation of cells with 0.1 μm NA, suggesting maximal activation of Go proteins (Fig. 2D). Upon stimulation with 100 μm NA, FRET increased markedly, suggesting only a partial activation of Go proteins (Fig. 2D). When NA was washed out, FRET decreased until reaching equivalent levels as observed upon stimulation with 0.1 μm NA (Fig. 2D), indicative of maximum Go protein reactivation. The kinetics of the initiation and relief of the attenuation of GIRK currents induced by 100 μm NA were not significantly different from those measured for G protein activity (supplemental Fig. S2). A concentration-response curve for the attenuation of G protein activation with a −log EC50 of 5.6 ± 0.04 (n = 8) (Fig. 2C, red trace) was obtained, when the increase in FRET at 0.3 μm, 1 μm, 3 μm, 10 μm, and 30 μm NA (Fig. 2E) was normalized to the increase at 100 μm NA (representing maximum attenuation of Go protein activation). This result again corresponded to the published NA binding at α2A-AR (22.Bünemann M. Bücheler M.M. Philipp M. Lohse M.J. Hein L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47512-47517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The mean increase in FRET upon stimulation with 100 μm NA (Fig. 2F) was significantly larger for clone I (0.095 ± 0.013, n = 14) compared with a second cell line, expressing α2A-AR at 2.2 pmol/mg (0.009 ± 0.004, n = 14). In summary, these results suggested that the amount of active receptors primarily determines the extent of the paradoxical attenuation of GIRK currents and G protein activation. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we attempted to monitor receptor-G protein interactions and G protein activation in single permeabilized cells while controlling cytoplasmic guanine nucleotides. First, we tested, whether preactivated Go proteins interact with active α2A-AR and second, whether interactions depend on the cytoplasmic guanine nucleotide levels. Receptor-G protein interactions were directly studied by means of FRET in transiently transfected HEK293T cells (21.Hein P. Frank M. Hoffmann C. Lohse M.J. Bünemann M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4106-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) as illustrated in Fig. 1B. Upon interaction of CFP-tagged Gγ2 and YFP-tagged α2A-AR, the distance between CFP and YFP moieties decreases and thereby gives rise to a more efficient FRET. An increase in FRET was observed in single intact cells (Fig. 3A) as well as in single permeabilized cells in the presence of either a low physiological (24.Breitwieser G.E. Szabo G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 91: 469-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) 10 μm GTP (Fig. 3B) or 1 μm GTPγS (Fig. 3C) upon reversibly switching superfusion of cells from 0.1 μm NA to 100 μm NA. The mean increase in FRET was not significantly different between these conditions (Fig. 3D). Reversibly switching the superfusion between 0.1 μm NA and NA-free buffer showed no increase in FRET, in line with results by Hein et al. (21.Hein P. Frank M. Hoffmann C. Lohse M.J. Bünemann M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4106-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). For GDP, the affinity of Gα toward GDP is lowered, when Gα interacts with active receptors, promoting formation of a stable complex of nucleotide-free G proteins and active receptors (5.Kagawa H. Asai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7106-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This process may be enhanced by low GDP concentrations, resulting in increased receptor-G protein interactions. The same principle may also apply to the interactions of active receptors with GTP- or GTPγS-bound G proteins. Therefore, we tested whether NA-induced receptor-G protein interactions measured by FRET increase in the presence of low nucleotide concentrations. A significantly larger NA-induced gain of FRET, normalized to maximum and minimum levels of receptor-G protein interactions, as explained under “Experimental Procedure” was observed upon decreasing GTPγS, GTP, and GDP concentrations (Fig. 4, A and B). The nucleotide-induced decrease in FRET was not significantly different among all conditions tested (Fig. 4C). These results imply transient interactions of receptors with GTP- or GTPγS-bound G proteins. Additionally, they suggest a fast receptor-mediated release of GTPγS and GTP from Gαo resulting in complexes of nucleotide-free heterotrimeric G proteins and agonist-bound receptors. Therefore, a receptor-mediated release of radioactively labeled GTPγ35S is feasible, corresponding to reports of a GTPγ35S exchange in native, atrial cell membranes upon muscarinic acetylcholine receptor stimulation (13.Hilf G. Kupprion C. Wieland T. Jakobs K.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We tested for displacement of radioactively labeled GTPγ35S by an excess of non-labeled GTPγS in an agonist-dependent manner using membranes of the α2A-AR-expressing HEK293 cell line (clone I). After steady-state incubation with GTPγ35S and 0.1 μm NA, the reaction batch was split into two groups. The first group was incubated with the α2A-AR antagonist rauwolscine (1 mm to antagonize the presence of NA) and an excess of non-labeled GTPγS, showing a small decrease in GTPγ35S binding after 15 min by 16.9% ± 1.6% (n = 3). The second group was incubated with 100 μm NA and an excess of non-labeled GTPγS, resulting in a loss of GTPγ35S binding by 94.4% ± 0.7% (n = 3) after 15 min (Fig. 5A). An agonist-induced GTPγS exchange of preactivated G proteins may also be detectable as an agonist-induced deactivation of GTPγS-preactivated G proteins upon withdrawal of GTPγS. We tested whether an activation of G proteins corresponding to physiological activation of G proteins can be observed in a single permeabilized cell. α2A-AR-expressing cells (clone I) transfected with fluorescent Go protein subunits showed a decrease in FRET upon switching the superfusion of cells from 10 μm GDP to 10 μm GTP in the presence of 0.1 μm NA (Fig. 5B), indicative of Go protein activation with kinetics expected for physiological Go protein or Go protein effector activation (20.Frank M.

U.S.A. 1997; 94: 10461-10466Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). To assess deactivation of GTPγS-preactivated Go proteins, permeabilized cells were superfused with internal buffer containing 0.1 μm NA and 1 μm GTPγS until saturated binding of GTPγS to Gαo, as reflected by a steady-state decrease in FRET. Subsequently, NA and GTPγS were withdrawn from the buffer. Continuing superfusion of cells with internal buffer lead at most to an increase in FRET of 10% over 5 min (normalized as explained under “Experimental Procedures”). In contrast, addition of NA to superfused internal buffer resulted in a substantially faster increase in FRET in the presence of 100 μm NA compared with 0.1 μm NA (Fig. 5C, n = 7 each), indicating Go protein deactivation. Experiments conducted for 10 μm NA and 1 μm NA showed intermediate kinetics (data not shown, n = 7 each). These data corroborated that active α2A-ARs induce GTPγS release of GTPγS-bound Gαo proteins leading to nucleotide-free, inactive G proteins. Collectively, the results of the study suggest that during strong receptor stimulation a transient deactivation of GTP- or GTPγS-preactivated Go proteins may be observable in the continuous presence of GTP or GTPγS. A decrease in FRET upon receptor stimulation with 0.1 μm NA was observed with single α2A-AR-expressing cells (clone I), transfected with fluorescent Go protein subunits, in the presence of either 10 μm GTP (Fig. 6A) or 1 μm GTPγS (Fig. 6B, beginning of the trace). FRET increased markedly (Fig. 6A and beginning of trace in Fig. 6B) upon switching superfusion from 0.1 μm NA to 100 μm NA, indicating a substantial deactivation of preactivated Go proteins. The deactivation of Go proteins was significantly larger in the presence of 1 μm GTPγS compared with the presence of 100 μm GTPγS (Fig. 6C, 47.1% ± 9.7% versus 9.3% ± 3.7%, n = 8 each, data normalized as explained under “Experimental Procedures”). Moreover, the deactivation depended on the concentration of NA applied and exhibited a −log EC50 of 4.6 ± 0.06 (n = 7) (Fig. 6D) in the presence of 1 μm GTPγS. Compared with intact cells, the EC50 was shifted by approximately one order of magnitude. A similar shift of the EC50 was observed for the activation of the FRET-based α2A-adrenergic receptor sensor α2A-cam (26.Vilardaga J.P. Bünemann M. Krasel C. Castro M. Lohse M.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) in permeabilized cells in the presence of 1 μm GTPγS compared with intact cells (permeabilized: −log EC50 3.8 ± 0.05, n = 5; intact: −log EC50 5.4 ± 0.02, n = 6). Taken together, a coherent explanation of these results would be a receptor-induced loss of nucleotides of preactivated Go proteins upon interaction with active α2A-AR and subsequent formation of a complex of nucleotide-free Go proteins and active α2A-receptors. The focus of the present study is an under-appreciated aspect of the G protein cycle: interactions of active G proteins with active receptors. These interactions will lead to recognizable effects only at high expression levels of one or several GPCRs competing for the same subtype of G protein. In such a case, increasing stimulation of receptors may not only lead to an increase in G protein effector activity but may also paradoxically deactivate G protein effectors at very strong stimulation. Several potential mechanisms may account for this paradoxical effect: mechanism I, transient receptor desensitization or GIRK channel desensitization; mechanism II, “scavenging” of Gβγ (which activates the GIRK channel) by GPCR kinases during agonist stimulation; mechanism III, scavenging of active, GTP-bound G proteins by active receptors; or mechanism IV, scavenging of deactivated G proteins by active receptors, either due to forced GTP hydrolysis and subsequent release of GDP or by a direct GTP release. Several results argue against a transient receptor or GIRK channel desensitization (mechanism I) as well as scavenging of Gβγ by GPCR kinases (mechanism II): GIRK currents and G protein activation become quickly reactivated during washout of strong agonist stimulation (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. S2) to an extent, as elicited by weak agonist stimulation. The beginning and end of the investigated attenuation correspond to kinetics published for receptor activation and receptor-G protein interactions (21.Hein P. Frank M. Hoffmann C. Lohse M.J. Bünemann M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4106-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 26.Vilardaga J.P. Bünemann M. Krasel C. Castro M. Lohse M.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 807-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Moreover, a strong receptor reserve and attenuation were observed in patch clamp experiments over 15 min. Monitoring GIRK currents and G protein activation in intact cells did not allow us to distinguish whether scavenging of GTP-bound G proteins (mechanism III) or inactivation of GTP-bound G proteins (mechanism IV) by active receptors is primarily responsible for the paradoxical GIRK current attenuation. Performance of single cell FRET assays subsequent to permeabilization of the plasma membrane allowed analysis of receptor-G protein interactions and G protein activation while controlling intracellular nucleotides. Data suggest that GTP-bound heterotrimeric G proteins interact with active receptors rather transiently. However, a subsequent release of nucleotide upon interaction may lead to a stable receptor-G protein complex, as proposed by the ternary complex model (5.Kagawa H. Asai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7106-7117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus resulting in the paradoxical G protein deactivation. The study provides evidence to support this model: (i) Agonist-induced receptor-G protein interactions were increased in the presence of low concentrations of nucleotides (Fig. 4B). Moreover, receptor-G protein interactions were maximal in the absence of nucleotides, as recently reported using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments (27.Qin K. Sethi P.R. Lambert N.A. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 2920-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). (ii) A receptor-mediated inactivation of GTPγS-preactivated Go proteins was observed (Fig. 5C). (iii) During strong receptor stimulation, a transient attenuation of GTPγS-preactivated Go proteins was found only in the presence of a low GTPγS concentration (Fig. 6), corresponding to the increased receptor-G protein interactions in the presence of low GTPγS concentrations (Fig. 4). Moreover, this result excludes a rapid hydrolysis of GTP upon interaction of GTP-bound G proteins with active receptors. Active G proteins interact with active receptors in heterotrimeric G protein conformation (Fig. 7): changes in FRET for the used CFP/YFP donor/acceptor pair can only be detected if CFP and YFP are within a range of <10 nm (28.Tsien R.Y. Bacskai B.J. Adams S.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1993; 3: 242-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The FRET-based assay for the G protein activation used an YFP-tagged Gαo and a CFP-tagged Gγ subunit. Upon strong receptor activation, an increase in FRET was observed, reflecting not only G protein deactivation but also requiring both YFP and CFP tags of G protein subunits to come within 10 nm distance, as feasible in a heterotrimeric G protein conformation. The fast kinetics of the attenuation may also suggest that activated Go proteins (similarly to Gi (19.Bünemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar)) do not fully dissociate into Gα and Gβγ subunits upon their activation. Consequently, data would support models of the G protein cycle, in which activated G proteins remain in equilibrium between heterotrimeric conformation and subunit dissociation. The physiological role of the “reversed activation” remains presently unresolved. It may well account for bell-shaped concentration-response curves, in which a paradoxical decrease in effect is observed at high agonist concentrations. Tissues with a high receptor expression or low GTP concentrations, which are exposed to high agonist concentrations, would be strong candidates. The level of endogenous receptor expression could so far only be determined by means of radioligand binding in membranes derived from whole tissue. In the case of α2-adrenergic receptors the average expression level of the cortex is about 1/70th (29.MacKinnon A.C. Brown C.M. Spedding M. Kilpatrick A.T. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 98: 1143-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) of our HEK cells. Given the low abundance of noradrenergic neurons in the cortex, it does not seem unlikely that local receptor concentrations such as in synaptic terminals could reach levels close to the range of those of heterologous expression systems. In the present study we estimated that α2A-AR and Go were expressed at a ratio about 3:1 (supplemental Fig. S1). Exogenous expression of Gαo-YFP in individual HEK cells lead to an estimated increase of 5- to 6-fold in total Gαo content (supplemental Fig. S1, B and C). Physiological expression levels for Go proteins vary over a wide range for different tissues, some expressing rather low levels such as human atrial myocytes (1 pmol/mg (30.Asano T. Shinohara H. Morishita R. Norota I. Kato K. Endoh M. J. Biochem. 1995; 117: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar)). In rod cells, the concentration of rhodopsin is up to 3 mm, but the GTP concentration is also up to 1000 μm GTP (31.Biernbaum M.S. Bownds M.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1979; 74: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 32.Hárosi F.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 1975; 66: 357-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In context with the almost complete dissociation of transducin upon its activation (33.Rosenzweig D.H. Nair K.S. Wei J. Wang Q. Garwin G. Saari J.C. Chen C.K. Smrcka A.V. Swaroop A. Lem J. Hurley J.B. Slepak V.Z. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5484-5494Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), interactions of activated transducin with rhodopsin during light stimulation are very unlikely. Taken together, data of this study are in line with the present model of G protein cycling. Data result from transient interactions of nucleotide-bound G proteins with active receptors and stable interactions of nucleotide-free G proteins with active receptors. The equilibrium between these states results from the interplay of nucleotide concentrations and active-receptor concentrations. We thank Dr. B.
