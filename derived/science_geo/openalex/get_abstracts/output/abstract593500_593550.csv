Jin et al. synthesized a fully π-conjugated COF through condensation reactions of tetrakis(4-formylphenyl)pyrene and 1,4-phenylenediacetonitrile. The reactions were reversible, which provides the self-healing needed to form a crystalline material of stacked, π-bonded 2D sheets. Chemical oxidation of this semiconductor with iodine greatly enhanced its conductivity, and the radicals formed on the pyrene centers imparted a high spin density and paramagnetism.

Paolucci et al. found that these copper ions may move about during the reaction (see the Perspective by Janssens and Vennestrom). Zeolite catalysts generally fix metals in place while the reacting partners flow in and out of their cagelike structures. In this case, though, x-ray absorption spectroscopy suggested that the ammonia was mobilizing the copper ions to pair up as they activated oxygen during the catalytic cycle.

Amini et al. used polymers infused with organic lubricants to prevent mussels from adhering to a submerged surface. The infused polymer presents a relatively soft surface to the mussel. This means that when the mussel probes the surface with its feet, it is less likely to release adhesive threads, which reduces its adhesion. The antifouling properties of the treatment were observed in both a laboratory setting and field testing. Science , this issue p. 668"

The recent discovery that human tumors harbor mutations in the promoter region of the telomerase gene ( TERT ) produced a flurry of research aimed at elucidating the role of these mutations in cancer development. Chiba et al. present data that reconcile many of the conflicting results reported to date (see the Perspective by Shay). In human melanoma samples and a fibroblast model, TERT promoter mutations acted in two steps. First, the mutations allowed cells to proliferate with short telomeres. This fueled genomic instability and up-regulation of telomerase expression, leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Science , this issue p. 1416 ; see also p. 1358"

The enrichment of vinculin at cellular adhesions is thus an indicator of load-induced reinforcement of the cytoskeletal linkage. Huang et al. used a single-molecule optical trap assay to measure the binding lifetimes of vinculin to single actin filaments under load. The vinculin-F-actin interaction formed a directional catch bond—one that is very weak at low force but that greatly increases in lifetime with increasing force. This explains vinculin's role as a reinforcing linker at both cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions. Science , this issue p. 703"

In the past few years, much progress has been made in identifying itch-selective molecules and neurons. However, we know very little about the brain circuits underlying itch processing. Mu et al. found that a subpopulation of itch-processing neurons in the spinal cord directly excite other neurons that project to a brain stem structure called the parabrachial nucleus. Inhibition of this spino-parabrachial pathway reduced itching and scratching in mice. Science , this issue p. 695"

The final step involves a reaction between methyl-coenzyme M and coenzyme B to give CoM-S-S-CoB and methane. Wagner et al. report a high-resolution structure of the methanogenic heterodisulfide reductase (HdtABC)-[NiFe]-hydrogenase, the enzyme that reduces the disulfide and couples this to the reduction of ferredoxin in an energy-conserving process known as flavin-based electron bifurcation (FBEB) (see the Perspective by Dobbek). The reduced ferredoxin, in turn, drives the first step of methanogenesis. The structure shows how two noncubane [4Fe-4S] clusters perform disulfide cleavage and gives insight into the mechanism of FBEB. Science , this issue p. 699 ; see also p. 642"

In contrast to extracellular systems, the type 6 secretion system (T6SS) is defined by intracellular localization and attachment to the cytoplasmic membrane. Here we used cryo-focused ion beam milling, electron cryotomography, and functional assays to study a T6SS in Amoebophilus asiaticus The in situ architecture revealed three modules, including a contractile sheath-tube, a baseplate, and an anchor. All modules showed conformational changes upon firing. Lateral baseplate interactions coordinated T6SSs in hexagonal arrays.

To examine the effect of physical activity dose on changes in physical functioning and the onset of major mobility disability in The Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) Study. We conducted a multicenter single masked randomized controlled trial that enrolled participants in 2010 and 2011 and followed them for an average of 2.6 years. 1,635 sedentary men and women aged 70-89 years who had functional limitations were randomized to a structured moderate intensity walking, resistance, and flexibility physical activity program or a health education program. Physical activity dose was assessed by 7-day accelerometry and self-report at baseline and 24 months. Outcomes included the 400 m walk gait speed, the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), assessed at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months, and onset of major mobility disability (objectively defined by loss of ability to walk 400 m in 15 min). When the physical activity arm or the entire sample were stratified by change in physical activity from baseline to 24 months, there was a dose-dependent increase in the change in gait speed and SPPB from baseline at 6, 12, and 24 months. In addition, the magnitude of change in physical activity over 24 months was related to the reduction in the onset of major mobility disability (overall P < 0.001) (highest versus the lowest quartile of physical activity change HR 0.23 ((95% CI:0.10-0.52) P = 0.001) in the physical activity arm. We observed a dose-dependent effect of objectively monitored physical activity on physical functioning and onset of major mobility disability. Relatively small increases (> 48 minutes per week) in regular physical activity participation had significant and clinically meaningful effects on these outcomes.ClinicalsTrials.gov NCT00116194."
https://openalex.org/W2749756316,"Oxidative stress has been implicated in multiple human neurological and other disorders. Proteasomes are multi-subunit proteases critical for the removal of oxidatively damaged proteins. To understand stress-associated human pathologies, it is important to uncover the molecular events underlying the regulation of proteasomes upon oxidative stress. To this end, we investigated H2O2 stress–induced molecular changes of the human 26S proteasome and determined that stress-induced 26S proteasome disassembly is conserved from yeast to human. Moreover, we developed and employed a new proteomic approach, XAP (in vivo cross-linking–assisted affinity purification), coupled with stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)–based quantitative MS, to capture and quantify several weakly bound proteasome-interacting proteins and examine their roles in stress-mediated proteasomal remodeling. Our results indicate that the adapter protein Ecm29 is the main proteasome-interacting protein responsible for stress-triggered remodeling of the 26S proteasome in human cells. Importantly, using a disuccinimidyl sulfoxide–based cross-linking MS platform, we mapped the interactions of Ecm29 within itself and with proteasome subunits and determined the architecture of the Ecm29–proteasome complex with integrative structure modeling. These results enabled us to propose a structural model in which Ecm29 intrudes on the interaction between the 20S core particle and the 19S regulatory particle in the 26S proteasome, disrupting the proteasome structure in response to oxidative stress.

Oxidative stress has been associated with the aging process and implicated in many human diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders (1Barnham K.J. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. Neurodegenerative diseases and oxidative stress.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (2753) Google Scholar). Protein oxidation can lead to unwanted changes in protein structure and function, resulting in the accumulation of severely oxidized proteins, subsequent cytotoxicity, and, ultimately, cell death. Therefore, oxidatively damaged proteins must be repaired or removed in a timely fashion to maintain cell homeostasis. Most oxidized proteins undergo selective proteolysis, and abundant evidence has indicated that proteasomes play a critically important role in the removal of oxidized proteins to preserve cell viability in response to oxidative stress (2Byvaltsev V.

In addition, proteasomes are highly regulated during cellular responses to oxidative stresses. However, the molecular details underlying such modulation remain largely unexplored, particularly in human cells. The 26S proteasome is a macromolecular machine responsible for ubiquitin/ATP-dependent protein degradation and comprises two subcomplexes: a 20S core particle (CP) 3The abbreviations used are: CPcore particleRPregulatory particleXAP-MSin vivo cross-linking–assisted affinity purificationFAformaldehydeSILACstable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell cultureKDknockdownPIPproteasome-interacting proteinTRCtransmembrane recognition complexDSSOdisuccinimidyl sulfoxideMSnmultistage tandem mass spectrometryLlightHheavyXL-MScross-linking mass spectrometryHTBH tagHistidine-TEV-Biotin-Histidine tagHBTH tagHistidine-Biotin-TEV-Histidine tagTB tagTEV-Biotin tagXL-MScross-linking mass spectrometryFDRfalse discovery rate. and a 19S regulatory particle (RP) (5Voges D.

Recognition and processing of ubiquitin-protein conjugates by the proteasome.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 477-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). The 20S CP harbors various catalytic activities, including chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and caspase-like peptidase activities. It is composed of seven α and seven β subunits in eukaryotes that form a conserved cylindrical structure of four heptameric stacked rings assembled in the order of αββα. Activation of the 20S CP requires binding to proteasome activator proteins (5Voges D. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. The 26S proteasome: a molecular machine designed for controlled proteolysis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 1015-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). The 19S RP is one of the major proteasome activators and consists of at least 19 distinct subunits that constitute the base and lid subcomplexes. The base is composed of six ATPases (Rpt1–6) and four non-ATPase subunits (Rpn1, 2, 10, and 13), whereas the remaining nine subunits (Rpn3, 5–9, 11, and 12 and Rpn15/Sem1) comprise the lid structure. The 19S RP carries multiple functions to facilitate substrate degradation, including substrate recognition, deubiquitination, protein unfolding, substrate translocation, and gating of the 20S CP. In contrast to the highly ordered and stable structure of the 20S CP, the 19S RP appears to be much more flexible and dynamic. Nevertheless, the overall architectures of the 19S RP and the 26S holocomplex are highly conserved from yeast to human (7Lander G.C. Estrin E. Matyskiela M.E. Bashore C. Nogales E. Martin A.

To facilitate the removal of oxidatively damaged proteins, ubiquitin/ATP-independent degradation by the 20S CP is significantly enhanced because of the increased amount of free 20S CP in cells, which is not the result of transcriptional control but, rather, of oxidative stress–triggered disassembly of the 26S proteasome (13Wang X.

Depletion of the 26S proteasome adaptor Ecm29 increases Toll-like receptor 3 signaling.Sci. Signal. 2013; 6: ra86Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, how Ecm29 regulates the activity of the 26S proteasome in human cells, particularly in response to oxidative stress, is largely unknown. Therefore, further studies are needed to fully describe the molecular details underlying stress-mediated regulation of the 26S proteasome. Here we quantitatively examined oxidative stress–mediated changes in the human 26S proteasome by developing a new affinity purification-MS strategy. In addition, we investigated the recruitment of Ecm29 to the proteasome and its associated biological implications. Moreover, we employed cross-linking mass spectrometry to define interactions within the Ecm29–proteasome complex, which were used for integrative structure modeling. Together, the results allow us to propose a structural model in which Ecm29 intrudes on the interaction between the 20S CP and 19S RP, thus modulating the function of the proteasome in response to oxidative stress. To evaluate the compositional changes of the human 26S proteasome under oxidative stress, we applied a single-step affinity purification procedure using an HTBH-tagged proteasome subunit (i.e. Rpn11-HTBH) as bait (23Wang X. Chen C.F. Baker P.R. Chen P.L. Kaiser P. Huang L. Mass spectrometric characterization of the affinity-purified human 26S proteasome complex.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3553-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This method has proven to be fast and effective to obtain functional human proteasome complexes and to identify proteasome-interacting proteins (23Wang X. Chen C.F. Baker P.R. Chen P.L. Kaiser P. Huang L. Mass spectrometric characterization of the affinity-purified human 26S proteasome complex.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3553-3565Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 24Wang X. Huang L. Identifying dynamic interactors of protein complexes by quantitative mass spectrometry.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2008; 7: 46-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, one of the key proteasome regulators, Ecm29, was not co-purified with human proteasomes. This is not surprising, as dynamic or transient interactions are often lost during conventional affinity purification (24Wang X. Huang L. Identifying dynamic interactors of protein complexes by quantitative mass spectrometry.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2008; 7: 46-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 25Guerrero C. Milenkovic T. Przulj N. Kaiser P. Huang L.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 13333-13338Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To circumvent this problem, we developed a new strategy named in vivo cross-linking–assisted affinity purification MS (XAP-MS) (Fig. 1A). XAP-MS integrates mild in vivo formaldehyde (FA) cross-linking (<0.1%) prior to cell lysis, which enables better preservation of 26S proteasome intactness and proteolytic activities during native lysis (26Yu C. Yang Y. Wang X. Guan S. Fang L. Liu F. Walters K.J. Kaiser P. Huang L.

Proteomics. 2016; 15: 2279-2292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To quantify H2O2-induced changes, we coupled XAP-MS with SILAC-based quantitation, in which one population of 293Rpn11-HTBH cells was grown in light (L) medium and treated with H2O2, whereas the other population of the same cells was grown in heavy (H) medium as a control without treatment. The relative abundances of proteasome subunits between treated and untreated cells are represented by average peptide SILAC ratios (i.e. L/H) of the two compared samples (Fig. 1B and supplemental Table S2). As shown, all identified 19S RP subunits have SILAC ratios close to 1, indicating that the abundances of these subunits in the purified samples were unaffected by H2O2 stress (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the SILAC ratios of all 20S CP subunits decreased substantially with SILAC ratios of <0.4, demonstrating that oxidative stress resulted in dissociation of the 20S CP from the 19S RP. These results were validated using quantitative immunoblot analysis (supplemental Fig. S1). Similarly, we carried out XAP-SILAC MS experiments using 293α7/Pre10-HTBH cells. As expected, 20S CP subunits remained unchanged, whereas co-purified 19S RP subunits decreased substantially upon H2O2 stress (supplemental Fig. S2). Taken together, we confirmed that H2O2 stress–induced disassembly of the 26S proteasome is conserved in mammalian cells. Although it is known that Ecm29 can be recruited to the 19S proteasome during oxidative stress to regulate the proteasome composition in yeast (13Wang X. Yen J. Kaiser P. Huang L.

Signal. 2010; 3: ra88Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), it remains unclear whether Ecm29 is a general player in modulating proteasome structure upon oxidative stress in eukaryotic systems. To this end, we first determined H2O2-triggered enrichment of human Ecm29 in the 19S RP using quantitative XAP-MS and immunoblotting analyses (Fig. 1, C and D). This was further validated by reciprocal affinity purification using FLAG-Ecm29 and quantitative immunoblotting (Fig. 1E). As shown, increased amounts of the two selected 19S subunits (i.e. Rpn11 and Rpt6) were co-purified with Ecm29 upon H2O2 treatment, whereas the amount of a 20S subunit, α7/Pre10, did not change in the purified Ecm29 complex. This result suggests that, although there is a dramatic increase in Ecm29 binding to the 19S upon oxidative stress, there is no change in Ecm29 binding to the 26S, thus implying two populations of Ecm29 detected here. To understand how human Ecm29 regulates the 26S proteasome, we generated two Ecm29 knockdown (KD) cells (i.e. 293Rpn11-TB_Ecm29KD#53 and 293Rpn11-TB_Ecm29KD#55) (Fig. 2A). Quantitative immunoblotting analysis of purified proteasomes revealed that the abundances of the selected proteasome subunits (i.e. Rpt6 and α7/Pre10) are similar in Ecm29 KD and control KD cells under unstressed conditions (Fig. 2B). In addition, the 26S proteasomal activities were comparable in the two knockdown cells (Fig. 2C). Together, these results show that human Ecm29 is not essential for the assembly and function of the 26S proteasome. However, when cells were treated with H2O2 to induce oxidative stress, the 26S proteasome was rapidly disassembled in control KD cells, but such dissociation was considerably reduced in 293Rpn11-TB_Ecm29KD#53 and 293Rpn11-TB_Ecm29KD#55 cells (Fig. 2B). As expected, H2O2 stress also significantly reduced 26S proteasomal activities in control KD cells but not in Ecm29 KD cells (Fig. 2C). The observed changes in proteasomal activities correlated well with the levels of ubiquitinated proteins detected in these cells in the presence and absence of H2O2 stress, respectively (Fig. 2D). Collectively, our data strongly suggests that Ecm29 regulates H2O2-induced 26S proteasome disassembly in human cells. To further evaluate the function of Ecm29, we overexpressed human FLAG-Ecm29 in 293Rpn11-HTBH cells. Quantitative immunoblotting analyses of the purified proteasomes revealed that overexpression of Ecm29 resulted in more proteasome-bound Ecm29 and, concurrently, less 19S RP-associated 20S CP under normal conditions (Fig. 3A and supplemental Fig. S3). This suggests that increased abundance of Ecm29 under non-stress conditions can disrupt normal 26S proteasome integrity, albeit to a lesser extent compared with the impact of oxidative stress. Interestingly, upon H2O2 stress, an increased amount of Ecm29 was also detected at the 19S RP even in the presence of overexpressed Ecm29, similar to wild-type cells, resulting in increased separation of the 20S CP from the 19S RP. These results were subsequently confirmed by the measurements of 26S proteasomal activities, as illustrated in Fig. 3B. Our data demonstrate that Ecm29 plays an evolutionarily conserved role in regulating the 26S proteasome, especially upon oxidative stress. In addition to Ecm29, we identified 9 proteasome-interacting proteins (PIPs) that displayed H2O2-induced abundance changes alongside purified 19S RP (i.e. SILAC ratios ≥ 2) using quantitative XAP-MS analysis of 293Rpn11-HTBH cells (supplemental Table S2). Among them, five have known functions in the proteasome system: 19S assembly chaperones (p27/Nas2 and Rpn14/Gankyrin), deubiquitinase (Usp15), ubiquitin ligase (Ube3A), and Hsp70. Hsp70 has been shown to be important for proteasome reassembly after H2O2 stress (14Grune T. Catalgol B. Licht A. Ermak G. Pickering A.M. Ngo J.K. Davies K.J. HSP70 mediates dissociation and reassociation of the 26S proteasome during adaptation to oxidative stress.Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2011; 51: 1355-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Three of the four remaining PIPs (i.e. Bag6, Ubl4A, and Trc35) are components of a ubiquitin ligase–associated multiprotein transmembrane recognition complex (TRC), which is unique to mammalian systems. With the exception of Bag6 (27Akahane T. Sahara K. Yashiroda H. Tanaka K. Murata S. Involvement of Bag6 and the TRC pathway in proteasome assembly.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2234Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the other factors have not been linked to regulation of proteasome function. To confirm the MS results, respective immunoblotting analyses of purified Rpn11-containing proteasomes and FLAG–Ubl4A complexes were performed (supplemental Fig. S4). Our results demonstrate that the TRC complex interacts with the 26S proteasome via the 19S complex and that their interactions can be modulated by H2O2 stress. Given the similarity in H2O2-induced enrichment of the TRC complex to that of Ecm29 at the 19S RP, we initially hypothesized that the TRC complex may regulate the 26S proteasome complex in the same manner as human Ecm29 during oxidative stress. However, CRISPR-mediated knockout or siRNA-mediated silencing of Bag6 did not affect the interaction between 20S and 19S proteasomes in either normal or H2O2-treated cells (supplemental Fig. S5), suggesting that Bag6 is not required for H2O2-induced 26S proteasome disassembly. In addition, knockout of Bag6 did not interfere with H2O2-induced recruitment of Ecm29 to the 19S proteasome and vice versa. These results imply that Bag6 is not associated with Ecm29-dependent regulation of the 26S proteasome complex despite its increased association with the 19S RP upon H2O2 treatment. Because the TRC complex is thought to chaperone polypeptides en route to the proteasome to facilitate the degradation of folding-defective proteins, which include retrotranslocation products from the endoplasmic reticulum and mislocalized membrane proteins (28Binici J. Koch J. BAG-6, a jack of all trades in health and disease.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2014; 71: 1829-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Wang Q. Liu Y. Soetandyo N. Baek K. Hegde R. Ye Y. A ubiquitin ligase-associated chaperone holdase maintains polypeptides in soluble states for proteasome degradation.Mol. Cell. 2011; 42: 758-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), the increased association of Bag6 with the 19S complex may result from the loss of communication between the 19S and the 20S proteasome, which presumably traps ubiquitinated proteins together with their chaperones on the 19S complex. From these results, we concluded that, although oxidative stress-induced changes in the proteasome interactome are not limited to Ecm29, proteasome disassembly is specifically regulated by the 19S-associated Ecm29. Because of the lack of structural details on Ecm29 alone and its complex with proteasomes, how Ecm29 is recruited to the 19S particle during oxidative stress is largely unknown. To understand how Ecm29 regulates the proteasome upon oxidative stress, we employed our previously developed XL-MS strategy to determine protein interaction contacts at specific residues (30Kao A. Chiu C.L. Vellucci D. Yang Y. Patel V.R. Guan S. Randall A. Baldi P. Rychnovsky S.D. Huang L.

This XL-MS strategy enables simplified and accurate identification of cross-linked peptides by integrating an MS-cleavable homobifunctional amine-reactive NHS ester, disuccinimidyl sulfoxide (DSSO), with multistage tandem mass spectrometry (MSn) (30Kao A.

Proteomics. 2011; 10 (M110.002212)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). To ensure the capture of a sufficient amount of Ecm29–proteasome complexes, we co-expressed HTBH-Ecm29 in 293HTBH-Rpt6 cells and treated the cells with H2O2 stress prior to cell lysis. Single-step affinity purification by binding to streptavidin beads was carried out to isolate Ecm29–proteasome complexes for in vitro DSSO cross-linking, similar as described previously (11Wang X. Cimermancic P. Yu C. Schweitzer A. Chopra N. Engel J.L. Greenberg C. Huszagh A.S. Beck F. Sakata E. Yang Y. Novitsky E.J. Leitner A. Nanni P.

As shown, the cleavage of either of the two symmetric MS-cleavable C–S bonds in the linker region of the DSSO interlinked peptide α-β (m/z 848.66974+) resulted in detection of two characteristic fragment pairs: αA/βT (m/z 762.412+ and 925.922+) and αT/βA (m/z 778.392+ a"

https://openalex.org/W2749148239,"Mitochondrial activity and metabolic reprogramming influence the phenotype of cancer cells and resistance to targeted therapy. We previously established that an insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)-inducible mitochondrial UTP carrier (PNC1/SLC25A33) promotes cell growth. This prompted us to investigate whether IGF signaling is essential for mitochondrial maintenance in cancer cells and whether this contributes to therapy resistance. Here we show that IGF-1 stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis in a range of cell lines. In MCF-7 and ZR75.1 breast cancer cells, IGF-1 induces peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ coactivator 1β (PGC-1β) and PGC-1α–related coactivator (PRC). Suppression of PGC-1β and PRC with siRNA reverses the effects of IGF-1 and disrupts mitochondrial morphology and membrane potential. IGF-1 also induced expression of the redox regulator nuclear factor-erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (NFE2L2 alias NRF-2). Of note, MCF-7 cells with acquired resistance to an IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) tyrosine kinase inhibitor exhibited reduced expression of PGC-1β, PRC, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Interestingly, these cells exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction, indicated by reactive oxygen species expression, reduced expression of the mitophagy mediators BNIP3 and BNIP3L, and impaired mitophagy. In agreement with this, IGF-1 robustly induced BNIP3 accumulation in mitochondria. Other active receptor tyrosine kinases could not compensate for reduced IGF-1R activity in mitochondrial protection, and MCF-7 cells with suppressed IGF-1R activity became highly dependent on glycolysis for survival. We conclude that IGF-1 signaling is essential for sustaining cancer cell viability by stimulating both mitochondrial biogenesis and turnover through BNIP3 induction. This core mitochondrial protective signal is likely to strongly influence responses to therapy and the phenotypic evolution of cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2746343109,"The makings of the reproductive tract Every embryo, regardless of its sex, contains both male and female primitive reproductive tracts before sexual differentiation. To establish a sex-specific reproductive system, female embryos need to remove the components of male tracts. The general consensus contends that removal of the male tracts occurs by default, a passive outcome owing to a lack of testis-derived androgens. Working in mice, Zhao et al. discovered that this process instead was actively promoted by the transcription factor COUP-TFII (see the Perspective by Swain). Without the action of this factor, embryos retained male reproductive tracts, independently of androgen action. These findings unveil unexpected mechanisms underlying the sexually dimorphic establishment of reproductive tracts. Science , this issue p. 717 ; see also p. 648"
https://openalex.org/W2747628031,"Background Worldwide, stillbirth is one of the leading causes of death. Altered fetal growth and placental abnormalities are the strongest and most prevalent known risk factors for stillbirth. The aim of this study was to identify patterns of association between placental abnormalities, fetal growth, and stillbirth. Methods and findings Population-based case-control study of all stillbirths and a representative sample of live births in 59 hospitals in 5 geographic areas in the U.S. Fetal growth abnormalities were categorized as small (<10th percentile) and large (>90th percentile) for gestational age at death (stillbirth) or delivery (live birth) using a published algorithm. Placental examination by perinatal pathologists was performed using a standardized protocol. Data were weighted to account for the sampling design. Among 319 singleton stillbirths and 1119 singleton live births at ≥24 weeks at death or delivery respectively, 25 placental findings were investigated. Fifteen findings were significantly associated with stillbirth. Ten of the 15 were also associated with fetal growth abnormalities (single umbilical artery; velamentous insertion; terminal villous immaturity; retroplacental hematoma; parenchymal infarction; intraparenchymal thrombus; avascular villi; placental edema; placental weight; ratio birth weight/placental weight) while 5 of the 15 associated with stillbirth were not associated with fetal growth abnormalities (acute chorioamnionitis of placental membranes; acute chorioamionitis of chorionic plate; chorionic plate vascular degenerative changes; perivillous, intervillous fibrin, fibrinoid deposition; fetal vascular thrombi in the chorionic plate). Five patterns were observed: placental findings associated with (1) stillbirth but not fetal growth abnormalities; (2) fetal growth abnormalities in stillbirths only; (3) fetal growth abnormalities in live births only; (4) fetal growth abnormalities in stillbirths and live births in a similar manner; (5) a different pattern of fetal growth abnormalities in stillbirths and live births. Conclusions The patterns of association between placental abnormalities, fetal growth, and stillbirth provide insights into the mechanism of impaired placental function and stillbirth. They also suggest implications for clinical care, especially for placental findings amenable to prenatal diagnosis using ultrasound that may be associated with term stillbirths."

Tamura et al. systematically biased the judgments of monkeys in an old-new object recognition task by using either optogenetic or electrical stimulation. The monkeys judged an encountered object as familiar when the stimulation site was in a hotspot where memory neurons were clustered. However, at the hotspot's fringe region, where neurons lost selective responses to the learned objects, electrical microstimulation led the monkeys to mistakenly judge an object as never seen before.

Majority of the genotypes showed adaptive responses to low P condition. Based on phenotype behaviour using the best linear unbiased predictors for each trait, genotypes were classified into, P responsive, low P tolerant and P non-responsive types. Based on the overall phenotype performance under Pdef, 10 genotypes were identified as low P tolerants. The low P tolerant genotypes were characterised by increased shoot and root length and increased root hair induction with longer root hairs under Pdef, than under Psuf. Association mapping of P response traits using mixed linear models revealed four quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Two QTLs (qLRDW.1 and qLRDW.2) for low P response affecting root dry weight explained over 10% phenotypic variation. In silico synteny analysis across grass genomes for these QTLs identified putative candidate genes such as Ser-Thr kinase and transcription factors such as WRKY and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH). The QTLs for response under Psuf were mapped for traits such as shoot dry weight (qHSDW.1) and root length (qHRL.1). Putative associations of these QTLs over the syntenous regions on the grass genomes revealed proximity to cytochrome P450, phosphate transporter and pectin methylesterase inhibitor (PMEI) genes. This is the first report of the extent of phenotypic variability for P response in finger millet genotypes during seedling-stage, along with the QTLs and putative candidate genes associated with P starvation tolerance."

Sex chromosome trisomy affects 0.1% of the human population and is associated with infertility. We show that during reprogramming to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), fibroblasts from sterile trisomic XXY and XYY mice lose the extra sex chromosome through a phenomenon we term trisomy-biased chromosome loss (TCL). Resulting euploid XY iPSCs can be differentiated into the male germ cell lineage and functional sperm that can be used in intracytoplasmic sperm injection to produce chromosomally normal, fertile offspring. Sex chromosome loss is comparatively infrequent during mouse XX and XY iPSC generation. TCL also applies to other chromosomes, generating euploid iPSCs from cells of a Down syndrome mouse model. It can also create euploid iPSCs from human trisomic patient fibroblasts. The findings have relevance to overcoming infertility and other trisomic phenotypes."

Overall, 55% of all analyzed results were found to provide BF > 10 (often labeled as strong evidence) for the alternative hypothesis, while more than half of the remaining results do not pass the level of BF = 3 (labeled as anecdotal evidence).

Antibiotics, in particular the β-lactams, are considered one of the greatest medical advances of the 20th century since their discovery and widespread use in the 1940's (1Lewis K. Platforms for antibiotic discovery.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2013; 12: 371-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). However, due to the misuse of these life-saving drugs, antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria such as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are emerging at an alarming rate (2Frieden T.

One new strategy is the pursuit of novel compounds that target microbial signaling cascades that are relatively overlooked by traditional methods of antibiotic development. Reversible protein phosphorylation by bacterial kinases is one such process that has been garnering attention within the past decade as a potential target for truly novel antibiotics (6Kurosu M.

Agents Chemother. 2014; 58: 4486-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These phenotypes have led to interest in PASTA kinases as potential antibiotic targets in pathogens ranging from M. tuberculosis and S. aureus to Listeria monocytogenes. As a proof of principle, we previously demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of the PASTA kinase PrkA by the nonspecific kinase inhibitor staurosporine increases the susceptibility of the intracellular pathogen L. monocytogenes to β-lactams in broth culture (34Pensinger D.A. Aliota M.T. Schaenzer A.J. Boldon K.M. Ansari I.U. Vincent W.J. Knight B. Reniere M.L. Striker R. Sauer J.D.

Staurosporine's hallmark toxicity highlights the necessity for kinase inhibitors that are selective for a limited number of targets. eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinase penicillin-binding-protein and Ser/Thr kinase-associated imidazopyridine aminofurazan minimal inhibitory concentration myelin basic protein brain-heart infusion Protein Data Bank. Extensive efforts have been put forth to probe the biochemistry of eukaryotic kinases and identify structural features that can be exploited by selective kinase inhibitors for the treatment of a variety of human diseases, most notably cancer (36Liao J.J. Molecular recognition of protein kinase binding pockets for design of potent and selective kinase inhibitors.J. Med. Chem. 2007; 50: 409-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Such a wealth of established knowledge can be harnessed to probe bacterial kinase biochemistry and engineer inhibitors that act as selective antibiotics. Furthermore, the abundance of available small molecule kinase inhibitor libraries can be mined for bacterial kinase-selective scaffolds. Here, we report that GSK690693, an imidazopyridine aminofurazan (IPA) identified in a small molecule kinase inhibitor library, sensitizes L. monocytogenes to various β-lactams. We show that other members of the IPA family inhibit PrkA biochemically and sensitize L. monocytogenes to β-lactams to varying degrees. Finally, we demonstrate selectivity for the L. monocytogenes PASTA kinase both at the biochemical and microbiological level as compared with the S. aureus PASTA kinase Stk1 on an amino acid level. Taken together, our data validate the potential to exploit PASTA kinases as druggable targets and establish GSK690693 and other IPAs as both lead compounds and valuable tools to investigate PASTA kinase biology. In a wide variety of important Gram-positive pathogens, PASTA kinases are essential for resistance to β-lactam antibiotics (13Beltramini A.M. Mukhopadhyay C.D. Pancholi V.

Agents Chemother. 2014; 58: 4486-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that either genetic deletion or pharmacologic inhibition of the PASTA kinase PrkA with staurosporine sensitizes L. monocytogenes to β-lactams (34Pensinger D.A.

To identify specific (and therefore potentially less toxic) inhibitors of PrkA, we screened 625 small molecule kinase inhibitors from the GlaxoSmithKline Published Kinase Inhibitor Set (PKIS) (37Drewry D.H.

Sixteen compounds potentiated inhibition of L. monocytogenes growth by ceftriaxone at 3 S.D. or more above the mean including the positive control staurosporine (Fig. 1A, blue dot). Of these, nine compounds failed to show a dose-response, and an additional three showed β-lactam independence in secondary screens. The four remaining validated compounds were LY2228820, GSK690693, and our previously published compounds staurosporine and AZD5438 (supplemental Fig. S1). We selected GSK690693 (Fig. 1, A, green dot, and B) for further analysis due to the presence of structural congeners in the screen (Fig. 1A, red dots). Based on our previous investigation of staurosporine, we hypothesized that GSK690693 would also sensitize L. monocytogenes to other β-lactam antibiotics. To test this hypothesis, we determined the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of various antibiotics against wild-type L. monocytogenes in the presence and absence of 20 μm GSK690693 (Table 1). Importantly, GSK690693 sensitized L. monocytogenes to other β-lactams as well, including ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and meropenem, but had no β-lactam-independent effects up to 20 μm (supplemental Fig. S2), consistent with the lack of β-lactam-independent growth defects in ΔprkA mutants (34Pensinger D.A. Aliota M.T. Schaenzer A.J. Boldon K.M. Ansari I.U. Vincent W.J. Knight B. Reniere M.L. Striker R. Sauer J.D. Selective pharmacologic inhibition of a PASTA kinase increases Listeria monocytogenes susceptibility to β-lactam antibiotics.Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2014; 58: 4486-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Although GSK690693 had no effect on the MIC values of the non-β-lactams vancomycin or kanamycin, it did sensitize L. monocytogenes to the TarO inhibitor tunicamycin, consistent with the role of PASTA kinases in resistance to tunicamycin (23Pensinger D.A. Boldon K.M. Chen G.Y. Vincent W.J.B. Sherman K. Xiong M. Schaenzer A.J. Forster E.R.

To confirm that GSK690693 potentiation of β-lactam and tunicamycin sensitivity was through PASTA kinase inhibition, we tested the sensitivity of the ΔprkA mutant to the same antibiotics in the presence and absence of 20 μm GSK690693. GSK690693 afforded the ΔprkA strain no additional sensitization to any antibiotic tested, suggesting that the activity of GSK690693 is PrkA kinase-dependent (Table 1). Finally, GSK690693 sensitized wild-type L. monocytogenes in a concentration-dependent manner to a fixed subinhibitory concentration of ceftriaxone, demonstrating the reciprocal dose dependence of the kinase inhibitor-β-lactam potentiation (Fig. 2). Taken together, our data demonstrates that GSK690693 sensitizes L. monocytogenes to β-lactam antibiotics through PrkA inhibition.Table 1MIC of various antibiotics against WT and ΔprkA strains +/− 20 μm GSK690693GSK690693MIC (μg/ml)10403sΔprkA−+−+Ceftriaxone8 (4, 8)1 (0.5, 1)0.0625 (0.03125, 0.25)0.0625 (0.03125, 0.25)Ampicillin0.25 (0.25, 0.25)0.0625 (0.0625, 0.125)0.03125 (0.03125, 0.03125)0.03125 (0.03125, 0.03125)Meropenem0.25 (0.25, 0.25)0.125 (0.125, 0.25)0.03125 (0.03125, 0.0625)0.0625 (0.0625, 0.0625)Tunicamycin32 (32, 32)0.5 (0.5, 1)0.5 (0.5, 1)0.5 (0.5, 1)Vancomycin2 (2, 4)2 (2, 4)1 (1, 1)1 (1, 1)Kanamycin8 (8, 8)8 (8, 8)8 (8, 8)8 (8, 8) Open table in a new tab To assess the basis of kinase inhibitor/β-lactam potentiation at the biochemical level and to begin to understand biochemical determinants of activity, we assessed the kinase activity of the purified kinase domain of PrkA in the presence of increasing concentrations of GSK690693. Analysis by autoradiography revealed that GSK690693 robustly inhibited both PrkA autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of the nonspecific phosphoacceptor myelin basic protein (MBP) at concentrations as low as 2 μm (Fig. 3A). Consistent with this finding, analysis of kinase inhibition in the Kinase-Glo® assay (Promega) resulted in a calculated IC50 value of 0.84 μm (Table 2). Finally, in silico docking of GSK690693 in the kinase domain of PrkA predicted the 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol (alkynol) moiety penetrating into the gatekeeper-guarded back pocket of the kinase active site, similar to the orientation and mechanism of inhibition previously reported for GSK690693 bound to the eukaryotic kinase AKT (Fig. 3B) (40Heerding D.A.

Taken together, our data demonstrate that GSK690693 can directly inhibit PrkA activity in vitro.Table 2Summary of biochemical and microbiology data for various IPAs against L. monocytogenesCompoundRelative IC50 (95% CI)Ceftriaxone MICμmμg/mlDMSONAaNA, not applicable.8GSK6906930.84 (0.34, 2.00)1GSK554170A0.45 (0.080, 2.49)2GSK614526A0.42 (0.010, 17.17)0.25GSK902056A0.41 (0.10, 1.63)1SB-747651ANA8a NA, not applicable. Open table in a new tab There were seven other members of the IPA family in our library screen (Fig. 1, red dots), three of which demonstrated potentiation with ceftriaxone at >2 S.D. above the mean of the screen and whose structures are shown in Table 3. To determine whether the IPAs represent a broadly applicable scaffold for PASTA kinase inhibitors we tested 3 additional compounds for biochemical activity and ceftriaxone potentiation: GSK554170A, GSK614526A, and GSK902056A (Fig. 4A, Table 2). All three compounds showed statistically similar biochemical activity to GSK690693; however, GSK554170A was 2-fold less potent than GSK690693 microbiologically, whereas GSK614526A was 4-fold more potent than GSK690693. Taken together, our data suggest that these variations in the R2 and R3 positions of the PIA scaffold may play a role in target accessibility and/or stability in the bacterial cytosol. In contrast, SB-747651A, an IPA that lacks the alkynol moiety, neither potentiated β-lactam sensitivity (Fig. 4A) nor inhibited biochemical activity (Fig. 4B). This is consistent with molecular modeling that implicates the alkynol moiety in stabilization of binding and kinase inhibition (Fig. 3B). Taken together, our findings demonstrate that multiple compounds of the IPA family are capable of augmenting ceftriaxone activity to varying degrees and further suggest that the IPA pharmacophore can be further optimized for β-lactam sensitization.Table 3Structures of various IPA family compounds Open table in a new tab Figure 4IPAs potentiate ceftriaxone activity to varying degrees.

Surprisingly, we observed that GSK690693 was significantly less potent against the purified kinase domain of Stk1, the PASTA kinase homolog from Staphylococcus aureus (Fig. 5A), with a predicted IC50 greater than 40 μm by a Kinase-Glo® assay (supplemental Fig. S3E). Consistent with this finding, neither the ceftriaxone nor oxacillin MIC for the methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain LAC was altered in the presence of GSK690693, although there was a reproducibly minor slowdown in growth in the presence of GSK690693 relative to antibiotics alone (supplemental Fig. S3, D and E) consistent with the low level inhibition of Stk1 observed biochemically. In contrast, Δstk1 mutants are potently sensitized to both β-lactam antibiotics (Supplemental Fig. S3, B and C) as previously described (24Tambe"

A large panel of small non-coding microRNAs was reported to modulate the immune response in sepsis but have not been tested in clinical practice. Large-scale identification of microRNA networks in sepsis might reveal a new biological mechanism that can be also targeted by gene therapy. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to perform a comparison of the miRNA network between septic patients and healthy controls. We used the previously measured levels of expression of 16 different circulating human and viral microRNAs in plasma from 99 septic patients and 53 healthy controls. We used three different computational methods to find correlations between the expressions of microRNAs and to build microRNA networks for the two categories, septic patients and healthy controls. We found that the microRNA network of the septic patients is significantly less connected when compared to miRNA network of the healthy controls (21 edges vs 52 edges, P < 0.0001). We hypothesize that several microRNAs (miR-16, miR-29a, miR-146, miR-155, and miR-182) are being sponged in sepsis explaining the loss of connection in the septic patient miRNA network. This was specific for sepsis, as it did not occur in other conditions characterized by an increased inflammatory response such as in post-surgery patients. Using several target prediction instruments, we predicted potential common sponges for the miRNA network in sepsis from several signaling pathways. Understanding the dynamics of miRNA network in sepsis is useful to explain the molecular pathophysiology of sepsis and for designing therapeutic strategies that target essential components of the immune response pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2748762346,"Recent data suggest that noninvasive liver fibrosis indexes could be useful for predicting esophageal varices (EV) in cirrhotic patients. However, thus far, the diagnostic efficacy of these indexes in predicting portal hypertension (PH) in cirrhotic patients has been poorly evaluated.To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of noninvasive liver fibrosis indexes in the diagnosis of PH.A total of 238 cirrhotic patients underwent hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) evaluation and relevant serum tests to analyze the variables associated with PH grade. Then, the diagnostic performances of seven fibrosis indexes, the aspartate aminotransferase (AST)-to-alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio (AAR), AST-to-platelet (PLT) ratio index (APRI), fibrosis index (FI), FIB-4, Forns index, King's score and the Lok index, were evaluated to determine their efficacy in predicting clinically significant PH (CSPH) and severe PH (SPH). In addition, the performances of these fibrosis indexes in different subgroups were investigated.The results of a multivariate analysis of serum markers showed that AST values, platelet (PLT) count and albumin (ALB) were associated with PH grade. Among the seven-fibrosis indexes, King's score, APRI and the Lok index showed modest diagnostic accuracy in predicting CSPH and SPH, as indicated by AUC of 0.755 and 0.742, 0.740 and 0.742, and 0.722 and 0.717, respectively. In addition, combination of King's score (cutoff 23.47) and Lok index (cutoff 1.30) predicted presence of CSPH, with the highest PPV (95.38%) and +LR (5.49). A subgroup analysis indicated that the noninvasive screening model may be more applicable to patients with cirrhosis of viral etiology.Serum liver fibrosis indexes exhibited modest diagnostic accuracy for PH in cirrhotic patients. These indexes may not be able to replace HVPG measurements for the diagnosis of PH but may be used as a first-line screening method for CSPH in liver cirrhosis patients."

This study investigated the unproven assumption on which this approach is based, that in low transmission settings, infections cluster over small scales. Methods A prospective case-control study was conducted between January 2013 and August 2014 in Ohangwena and Omusati regions in north central Namibia. Patients attending health facilities who tested positive by malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) (index cases) were traced back to their home. All occupants of index case households (n = 116 households) and surrounding households (n = 225) were screened for Plasmodium infection with a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and interviewed to identify risk factors. A comparison group of 286 randomly-selected control households was also screened, to compare infection levels of RACD and non-RACD households and their neighbours. Logistic regression was used to investigate spatial clustering of patent and sub-patent infections around index cases and to identify potential risk factors that would inform screening approaches and identify risk groups. Estimates of the impact of RACD on onward transmission to mosquitoes was made using previously published figures of infection rates. Results Prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum infection by LAMP was 3.4%, 1.4% and 0.4% in index-case households, neighbors of index case households and control households respectively; adjusted odds ratio 6.1 [95%CI 1.9–19.5] comparing case households versus control households. Using data from Engela, neighbors of cases had higher odds of infection [adjusted OR 5.0 95%CI 1.3–18.9] compared to control households. All infections identified by RDTs were afebrile and RDTs identified only a small proportion of infections in case (n = 7; 17%) and control (0%) neighborhoods. Based on published estimates of patent and sub-patent infectiousness, these results suggest that infections missed by RDTs during RACD would allow 50–71% of infections to mosquitoes to occur in this setting. Conclusion Malaria infections cluster around passively detected cases. The majority of infections are asymptomatic and of densities below the limit of detection of current RDTs. RACD using standard RDTs are unlikely to detect enough malaria infections to dramatically reduce transmission. In low transmission settings such as Namibia more sensitive field diagnostics or forms of focal presumptive treatment should be tested as strategies to reduce malaria transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2745417717,"The syndecan family of heparan sulfate proteoglycans contributes to cell adhesion and communication by serving as co-receptors for cell signaling and extracellular matrix molecules. Syndecan-2 is located at the cell surface, and we previously reported that it induces matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) expression in colon cancer cells. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms are unknown. Here, we report that overexpression of syndecan-2 in HT-29 colon cancer cells increases the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and ERK in parallel with up-regulated MMP-7 expression, but a syndecan-2 mutant lacking the cytoplasmic domain showed significant reductions in these effects. Consistent with this observation, FAK inhibition via FAK-related non-kinase expression or inhibition of ERK with the ERK1/2 inhibitor SCH772984 diminished the syndecan-2-mediated up-regulation of MMP-7. Activation of PKC enhanced syndecan-2-mediated MMP-7 expression, whereas inhibition of PKC had the opposite effect. Of note, the exogenous expression of syndecan-2 triggered localization of PKCγ to the membrane. Expression of syndecan-2 harboring a phosphomimetic (S198E) mutation of the variable region of the cytoplasmic domain enhanced MMP-7 expression and FAK phosphorylation. Finally, experimental suppression of shedding of the syndecan-2 extracellular domain did not significantly affect the syndecan-2-mediated up-regulation of MMP-7 in the early period after syndecan-2 overexpression. Taken together, these findings suggest that syndecan-2's cytoplasmic domain up-regulates MMP-7 expression in colon cancer cells via PKCγ-mediated activation of FAK/ERK signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2747928151,"Ribosomopathies comprise a heterogeneous group of hematologic and developmental disorders, often characterized by bone marrow failure, skeletal and other developmental abnormalities and cancer predisposition. They are associated with mutations and/or haplo-insufficiencies of ribosomal proteins (RPs) and inefficient ribosomal RNA (rRNA) processing. The resulting ribosomal stress induces the canonical p19ARF/Mdm2/p53 tumor suppressor pathway leading to proliferative arrest and/or apoptosis. It has been proposed that this pathway is then inactivated during subsequent neoplastic evolution. We show here that two murine models of hepatoblastoma (HB) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) unexpectedly possess features that mimic the ribosomopathies. These include loss of the normal stoichiometry of RP transcripts and proteins and the accumulation of unprocessed rRNA precursors. Silencing of p19ARF, cytoplasmic sequestration of p53, binding to and inactivation of Mdm2 by free RPs, and up-regulation of the pro-survival protein Bcl-2 may further cooperate to drive tumor growth and survival. Consistent with this notion, re-instatement of constitutive p19ARF expression in the HB model completely suppressed tumorigenesis. In >2000 cases of human HCC, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer, RP transcript deregulation was a frequent finding. In HCC and breast cancer, the severity of this dysregulation was associated with inferior survival. In HCC, the presence of RP gene mutations, some of which were identical to those previously reported in ribosomopathies, were similarly negatively correlated with long-term survival. Taken together, our results indicate that many if not all cancers possess ribosomopathy-like features that may affect their biological behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2747085874,"In cognitive radio communication, spectrum sensing plays a vital role in sensing the existence of the primary user (PU). The sensing performance is badly affected by fading and shadowing in case of single secondary user(SU). To overcome this issue, cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS) is proposed. Although the reliability of the system is improved with cooperation but existence of malicious user (MU) in the CSS deteriorates the performance. In this work, we consider the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence method for minimizing spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attack. In the proposed CSS scheme, each SU reports the fusion center(FC) about the availability of PU and also keeps the same evidence in its local database. Based on the KL divergence value, if the FC acknowledges the user as normal, then the user will send unified energy information to the FC based on its current and previous sensed results. This method keeps the probability of detection high and energy optimum, thus providing an improvement in performance of the system. Simulation results show that the proposed KL divergence method has performed better than the existing equal gain combination (EGC), maximum gain combination (MGC) and simple KL divergence schemes in the presence of MUs."
https://openalex.org/W2749125045,"Structural MRI (sMRI)-identified tissue ""growth"" after neuropsychological training has been reported in many studies but the origins of those apparent tissue changes (ATC) still remain elusive. One possible contributor to ATC is brain perfusion since T1-weighted MRI, the tool used to identify ATC, is sensitive to perfusion-change induced tissue T1 alterations. To test the hypothetical perfusion contribution to ATC, sMRI data were acquired before and after short-term global and regional perfusion manipulations via intaking a 200 mg caffeine pill and performing a sensorimotor task. Caffeine intake caused a global CBF reduction and apparent tissue density reduction in temporal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and the limbic area; sensorimotor task induced CBF increase and apparent tissue increase in spatially overlapped brain regions. After compensating CBF alterations through a voxel-wise regression, the ATC patterns demonstrated in both experiments were substantially suppressed. These data clearly proved existence of the perfusion contribution to short-term ATC, and suggested a need for correcting perfusion changes in longitudinal T1-weighted structural MRI analysis if a short-term design is used."
https://openalex.org/W2746951431,"Skin is a highly plastic tissue that undergoes tissue turnover throughout life, but also in response to injury. YAP and Hedgehog signalling play a central role in the control of epidermal stem/progenitor cells in the skin during embryonic development, in postnatal tissue homeostasis and in skin carcinogenesis. However, the genetic contexts in which they act to control tissue homeostasis remain mostly unresolved. We provide compelling evidence that epidermal YAP and Hedgehog/GLI2 signalling undergo positive regulatory interactions in the control of normal epidermal homeostasis and in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) development, which in the large majority of cases is caused by aberrant Hedgehog signalling activity. We report increased nuclear YAP and GLI2 activity in the epidermis and BCCs of K14-CreER/Rosa-SmoM2 transgenic mouse skin, accompanied with increased ROCK signalling and ECM remodelling. Furthermore, we found that epidermal YAP activity drives GLI2 nuclear accumulation in the skin of YAP2-5SA-ΔC mice, which depends on epidermal β-catenin activation. Lastly, we found prominent nuclear activity of GLI2, YAP and β-catenin, concomitant with increased ROCK signalling and stromal fibrosis in human BCC. Our work provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between cell signalling events and mechanical force in normal tissue homeostasis in vivo, that could potentially be perturbed in BCC development."
https://openalex.org/W2748110831,"Pressures on freshwater biodiversity in Southeast Asia are accelerating yet the status and conservation needs of many of the region’s threatened fish species are unclear. This impacts the ability to implement conservation activities and to understand the effects of infrastructure developments and other hydrological changes. We used Local Ecological Knowledge from fishing communities on the Mekong River in the Siphandone waterscape, Lao PDR to estimate mean and mode last capture dates of eight rare or culturally significant fish species in order to provide conservation monitoring baselines. One hundred and twenty fishermen, from six villages, were interviewed. All eight species had been captured, by at least one of the interviewees, within the waterscape within the past year. However the mean and mode last capture dates varied between the species. Larger species, and those with higher Red List threat status, were caught less recently than smaller species of less conservation concern. The status of the Critically Endangered Pangasius sanitwongsei (mean last capture date 116.4 months) is particularly worrying suggesting severe population decline although cultural issues may have caused this species to have been under-reported. This highlights that studies making use of Local Ecological Knowledge need to understand the cultural background and context from which data is collected. Nevertheless we recommend our approach, of stratified random interviews to establish mean last capture dates, may be an effective methodology for monitoring freshwater fish species of conservation concern within artisanal fisheries. If fishing effort remains relatively constant, or if changes in fishing effort are accounted for, differences over time in mean last capture dates are likely to represent changes in the status of species. We plan to repeat our interview surveys within the waterscape as part of a long-term fish-monitoring program."
https://openalex.org/W2748894834,"The scaffold protein X-ray repair cross-complementing 1 (XRCC1) interacts with multiple enzymes involved in DNA base excision repair and single-strand break repair (SSBR) and is important for genetic integrity and normal neurological function. One of the most important interactions of XRCC1 is that with polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (PNKP), a dual-function DNA kinase/phosphatase that processes damaged DNA termini and that, if mutated, results in ataxia with oculomotor apraxia 4 (AOA4) and microcephaly with early-onset seizures and developmental delay (MCSZ). XRCC1 and PNKP interact via a high-affinity phosphorylation-dependent interaction site in XRCC1 and a forkhead-associated domain in PNKP. Here, we identified using biochemical and biophysical approaches a second PNKP interaction site in XRCC1 that binds PNKP with lower affinity and independently of XRCC1 phosphorylation. However, this interaction nevertheless stimulated PNKP activity and promoted SSBR and cell survival. The low-affinity interaction site required the highly conserved Rev1-interacting region (RIR) motif in XRCC1 and included three critical and evolutionarily invariant phenylalanine residues. We propose a bipartite interaction model in which the previously identified high-affinity interaction acts as a molecular tether, holding XRCC1 and PNKP together and thereby promoting the low-affinity interaction identified here, which then stimulates PNKP directly."
https://openalex.org/W2749716560,"An association between maternal IgG antibodies reactive against proteins in fetal brain and an outcome of autism in the child has been identified. Using a mouse model of prenatal intraventricular administration of autism-specific maternal IgG, we demonstrated that these antibodies produce behavioral alterations similar to those in children with ASD. We previously demonstrated that these antibodies bind to radial glial stem cells (RG) and observed an increase in the number of divisions of translocating RG in the developing cortex. We also showed an alteration in brain size and as well as a generalized increased of neuronal volume in adult mice. Here, we used our intraventricular mouse model of antibody administration, followed by Golgi and Neurolucida analysis to demonstrate that during midstages of neurogenesis these maternal autism-specific antibodies produced a consistent decrease in the number of spines in the infragranular layers in the adult cortical areas analyzed. Specifically, in the frontal cortex basal dendrites of layer V neurons were decreased in length and volume, and both the total number of spines—mature and immature—and the spine density were lower than in the control neurons from the same region. Further, in the occipital cortex layer VI neurons presented with a decrease in the total number of spines and in the spine density in the apical dendrite, as well as decrease in the number of mature spines in the apical and basal dendrites. Interestingly, the time of exposure to these antibodies (E14.5) coincides with the generation of pyramidal neurons in layer V in the frontal cortex and in layer VI in the occipital cortex, following the normal rostro-caudal pattern of cortical cell generation. We recently demonstrated that one of the primary antigens recognized by these antibodies corresponds to stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP1). Here we hypothesize that the reduction in the access of newborn cells to STIP1 in the developing cortex may be responsible for the reduced dendritic arborization and number of spines we noted in the adult cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2746642335,"The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors exert multiple functions in mammalian cerebral cortex development. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a member of the bHLH-Per-Arnt-Sim subfamily, is a ligand-activated transcription factor reported to regulate nervous system development in both invertebrates and vertebrates, but the functions that AhR signaling pathway may have for mammalian cerebral cortex development remains elusive. Although the endogenous ligand involved in brain developmental process has not been identified, the environmental pollutant dioxin potently binds AhR and induces abnormalities in higher brain function of laboratory animals. Thus, we studied how activation of AhR signaling influences cortical development in mice. To this end, we produced mice expressing either constitutively active-AhR (CA-AhR), which has the capacity for ligand-independent activation of downstream genes, or AhR, which requires its ligands for activation. In brief, CA-AhR-expressing plasmid and AhR-expressing plasmid were each transfected into neural stems cells in the developing cerebrum by in utero electroporation on embryonic day 14.5. On postnatal day 14, mice transfected in utero with CA-AhR, but not those transfected with AhR, exhibited drastically reduced dendritic arborization of layer II/III pyramidal neurons and impaired neuronal positioning in the developing somatosensory cortex. The effects of CA-AhR were observed for dendrite development but not for the commissural fiber projection, suggesting a preferential influence on dendrites. The present results indicate that over-activation of AhR perturbs neuronal migration and morphological development in mammalian cortex, supporting previous observations of impaired dendritic structure, cortical dysgenesis, and behavioral abnormalities following perinatal dioxin exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2748202219,"The function of protein products generated from intramembraneous cleavage by the γ-secretase complex is not well defined. The γ-secretase complex is responsible for the cleavage of several transmembrane proteins, most notably the amyloid precursor protein that results in Aβ, a transmembrane (TM) peptide. Another protein that undergoes very similar γ-secretase cleavage is the p75 neurotrophin receptor. However, the fate of the cleaved p75 TM domain is unknown. p75 neurotrophin receptor is highly expressed during early neuronal development and regulates survival and process formation of neurons. Here, we report that the p75 TM can stimulate the phosphorylation of TrkB (tyrosine kinase receptor B). In vitro phosphorylation experiments indicated that a peptide representing p75 TM increases TrkB phosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, mutagenesis analyses revealed that a valine residue at position 264 in the rat p75 neurotrophin receptor is necessary for the ability of p75 TM to induce TrkB phosphorylation. Because this residue is just before the γ-secretase cleavage site, we then investigated whether the p75(αγ) peptide, which is a product of both α- and γ-cleavage events, could also induce TrkB phosphorylation. Experiments using TM domains from other receptors, EGFR and FGFR1, failed to stimulate TrkB phosphorylation. Co-immunoprecipitation and biochemical fractionation data suggested that p75 TM stimulates TrkB phosphorylation at the cell membrane. Altogether, our results suggest that TrkB activation by p75(αγ) peptide may be enhanced in situations where the levels of the p75 receptor are increased, such as during brain injury, Alzheimer's disease, and epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W2747286557,"Cross linking of the IgE receptor (FcεRI) on mast cells plays a critical role in IgE-dependent allergy including allergic rhinitis, asthma, anaphylaxis, and delayed type hypersensitivity reactions. The Ca2+ activated K+ channel, KCa3.1, plays a critical role in IgE-stimulated Ca2+ entry and degranulation in mast cells by helping to maintain a negative membrane potential, which provides an electrochemical gradient to drive Ca2+ influx. Of the 3 classes of PI3K, the class II PI3Ks are the least studied and little is known about the roles for class II PI3Ks in vivo in the context of the whole organism under normal and pathological conditions. Studying bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMC) isolated from PI3KC2β-/- mice, we now show that the class II PI3KC2β is critical for FcεRI stimulated KCa3.1 channel activation and the subsequent activation of mast cells. We found FcεRI-stimulated Ca2+ entry, cytokine production, and degranulation are decreased in BMMC isolated from PI3KC2β-/- mice. In addition, PI3KC2β-/- mice are markedly resistant to both passive cutaneous and passive systemic anaphylaxis. These findings identify PI3KC2β as a new pharmacologic target to treat IgE-mediated disease."

However, the molecular mechanism of this antifungal activity is unknown. In this study, we show that eupolauridine 9591 (E9591), a synthetic analog of eupolauridine, and liriodenine methiodide (LMT), a methiodide salt of liriodenine, mediate their antifungal activities by disrupting mitochondrial iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster synthesis. Several lines of evidence supported this conclusion. First, both E9591 and LMT elicited a transcriptional response indicative of iron imbalance, causing the induction of genes that are required for iron uptake and for the maintenance of cellular iron homeostasis. Second, a genome-wide fitness profile analysis showed that yeast mutants with deletions in iron homeostasis-related genes were hypersensitive to E9591 and LMT. Third, treatment of wild-type yeast cells with E9591 or LMT generated cellular defects that mimicked deficiencies in mitochondrial Fe-S cluster synthesis including an increase in mitochondrial iron levels, a decrease in the activities of Fe-S cluster enzymes, a decrease in respiratory function, and an increase in oxidative stress. Collectively, our results demonstrate that E9591 and LMT perturb mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biosynthesis; thus, these two compounds target a cellular pathway that is distinct from the pathways commonly targeted by clinically used antifungal drugs.

https://openalex.org/W2747911645,"In bacteria, the membrane protein complex SecY/E/G and SecA ATPase are essential for protein translocation. About 30% of newly synthesized proteins in the cytosol are targeted to and translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane by the Sec factors. Although a number of single-molecule analyses and structural studies, including the crystal structure of SecYEG complexed with SecA, have been published, the underlying molecular mechanisms and the functional oligomer states remain elusive. In this study, we constructed a fusion protein SecY-SecA, which induces the formation of the SecY-A/SecE/SecG complex (SecYAEG), to enable investigation of the molecular mechanisms by advanced single-molecule analyses. SecYAEG-reconstituted liposomes were found to possess protein translocation activity in vitro and form stable intermediates capable of the translocation using a mutant substrate protein. We additionally found that one unit of SecYAEG complex embedded into a nanodisc, using membrane scaffold proteins, interacts strongly with the substrate. The isolated SecYAEG-reconstituted nanodisc is a promising tool for investigation of the molecular mechanisms by which a single unit of Sec machinery mediates protein translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2748732880,"In this paper, we present a robust text detection approach in natural images which is based on region proposal mechanism. A powerful low-level detector named saliency enhanced-MSER extended from the widely-used MSER is proposed by incorporating saliency detection methods, which ensures a high recall rate. Given a natural image, character candidates are extracted from three channels in a perception-based illumination invariant color space by saliency-enhanced MSER algorithm. A discriminative convolutional neural network (CNN) is jointly trained with multi-level information including pixel-level and character-level information as character candidate classifier. Each image patch is classified as strong text, weak text and non-text by double threshold filtering instead of conventional one-step classification, leveraging confident scores obtained via CNN. To further prune non-text regions, we develop a recursive neighborhood search algorithm to track credible texts from weak text set. Finally, characters are grouped into text lines using heuristic features such as spatial location, size, color, and stroke width. We compare our approach with several state-of-the-art methods, and experiments show that our method achieves competitive performance on public datasets ICDAR 2011 and ICDAR 2013."
https://openalex.org/W2746779657,"Past climate fluctuations shaped the population dynamics of organisms in space and time, and have impacted their present intra-specific genetic structure. Demo-genetic modelling allows inferring the way past demographic and migration dynamics have determined this structure. Amborella trichopoda is an emblematic relict plant endemic to New Caledonia, widely distributed in the understory of non-ultramafic rainforests. We assessed the influence of the last glacial climates on the demographic history and the paleo-distribution of 12 Amborella populations covering the whole current distribution. We performed coalescent genetic modelling of these dynamics, based on both whole-genome resequencing and microsatellite genotyping data. We found that the two main genetic groups of Amborella were shaped by the divergence of two ancestral populations during the last glacial maximum. From 12,800 years BP, the South ancestral population has expanded 6.3-fold while the size of the North population has remained stable. Recent asymmetric gene flow between the groups further contributed to the phylogeographical pattern. Spatially explicit coalescent modelling allowed us to estimate the location of ancestral populations with good accuracy (< 22 km) and provided indications regarding the mid-elevation pathways that facilitated post-glacial expansion."
https://openalex.org/W2748391457,"Neuronal activity is characterized by a diversity of oscillatory phenomena that are associated with multiple behavioral and cognitive processes, yet the functional consequences of these oscillations are not fully understood. Our aim was to determine whether and how these different oscillatory activities affect short-term synaptic plasticity (STP), using the olfactory system as a model. In response to odorant stimuli, the olfactory bulb displays a slow breathing rhythm as well as beta and gamma oscillations. Since the firing of olfactory bulb projecting neurons is phase-locked with beta and gamma oscillations, structures downstream from the olfactory bulb should be driven preferentially at these frequencies. We examined STP exhibited by olfactory bulb inputs in slices of adult mouse piriform cortex maintained in vitro in an in vivo-like ACSF (calcium concentration: 1.1 mM). We replaced the presynaptic neuronal firing rate by repeated electrical stimulation (frequency between 3.125 and 100 Hz) applied to the lateral olfactory tract. Our results revealed a considerable enhancement of postsynaptic response amplitude for stimulation frequencies in the beta and gamma range. A phenomenological model of STP fitted to the data suggests that the experimental results can be explained by the interplay between three mechanisms: a short-term facilitation mechanism (time constant ≈160 msec), and two short-term depression mechanisms (recovery time constants <20 msec and ≈140 msec). Increasing calcium concentration (2.2 mM) resulted in an increase in the time constant of facilitation and in a strengthening of the slowest depression mechanism. As a result, response enhancement was reduced and its peak shifted toward the low beta and alpha ranges while depression became predominant in the gamma band. Using environmental conditions corresponding to those that prevail in vivo, our study shows that STP in the lateral olfactory tract to layer Ia synapse allows amplification of olfactory bulb inputs at beta and gamma frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2747373497,"Lung cancer causes a large number of deaths per year. Until now, a cure for this disease has not been found or developed. Finding an effective drug through traditional experimental methods invariably costs millions of dollars and takes several years. It is imperative that computational methods be developed to integrate several types of existing information to identify candidate drugs for further study, which could reduce the cost and time of development. In this study, we tried to advance this effort by proposing a computational method to identify candidate drugs for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a major type of lung cancer. The method used three steps: (1) preliminary screening, (2) screening compounds by an association test and a permutation test, (3) screening compounds using an EM clustering algorithm. In the first step, based on the chemical-chemical interaction information reported in STITCH, a well-known database that reports interactions between chemicals and proteins, and approved NSCLC drugs, compounds that can interact with at least one approved NSCLC drug were picked. In the second step, the association test selected compounds that can interact with at least one NSCLC-related chemical and at least one NSCLC-related gene, and subsequently, the permutation test was used to discard nonspecific compounds from the remaining compounds. In the final step, core compounds were selected using a powerful clustering algorithm, the EM algorithm. Six putative compounds, protoporphyrin IX, hematoporphyrin, canertinib, lapatinib, pelitinib, and dacomitinib, were identified by this method. Previously published data show that all of the selected compounds have been reported to possess anti-NSCLC activity, indicating high probabilities of these compounds being novel candidate drugs for NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2750010767,"Despite availability of high quality medical records, health care systems often do not have the resources or tools to utilize these data efficiently. Yet, hospital-based, laboratory-confirmed records may pave the way for building reliable surveillance systems capable of monitoring temporal trends of emerging infections. In this communication, we present a new tool to compress and visualize medical records with a local population profile (LPP) approach, which transforms information into statistically comparable patterns. We provide a step-by-step tutorial on how to build, interpret, and expand the use of LPP using hospitalization records of laboratory-confirmed cholera. We abstracted case information from the databases maintained by the Department of Clinical Microbiology at Christian Medical College in Vellore, India. We used a single-year age distribution to construct LPPs for O1, O139, and non O1/O139 serotypes of Vibrio cholerae. Disease counts and hospitalization rates were converted into fitted kernel-based probability densities. We formally compared LPPs with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and created multi-panel visuals to depict temporal trend, age distribution, and hospitalization rates simultaneously. Our first implementation of LPPs revealed information that is typically gathered from surveillance systems such as: i) estimates of the demographic distribution of diseases and identification of a population at risk, ii) changes in the dominant pathogen presence; and iii) trends in disease occurrence. The LPP demonstrated the benefit of increased resolution in pattern detection of disease for different Vibrio cholerae serotypes and two demographic categories by showing patterns and anomalies that would be obscured by traditional methods of analysis and visualization. LPP can be used effectively to compile basic patient information such as age, sex, diagnosis, location, and time into compact visuals. Future development of the proposed approach will allow public health researchers and practitioners to broadly utilize and efficiently compress large volumes of medical records without loss of information."
