https://openalex.org/W2111760270,"Assessing Biodiversity Declines Understanding human impact on biodiversity depends on sound quantitative projection. Pereira et al. (p. 1496 , published online 26 October) review quantitative scenarios that have been developed for four main areas of concern: species extinctions, species abundances and community structure, habitat loss and degradation, and shifts in the distribution of species and biomes. Declines in biodiversity are projected for the whole of the 21st century in all scenarios, but with a wide range of variation. Hoffmann et al. (p. 1503 , published online 26 October) draw on the results of five decades' worth of data collection, managed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature Species Survival Commission. A comprehensive synthesis of the conservation status of the world's vertebrates, based on an analysis of 25,780 species (approximately half of total vertebrate diversity), is presented: Approximately 20% of all vertebrate species are at risk of extinction in the wild, and 11% of threatened birds and 17% of threatened mammals have moved closer to extinction over time. Despite these trends, overall declines would have been significantly worse in the absence of conservation actions."
https://openalex.org/W1991820745,"Myelin formation is a multistep process that is controlled by a number of different extracellular factors. During the development of the central nervous system (CNS), oligodendrocyte progenitor cells differentiate into mature oligodendrocytes that start to enwrap axons with myelin membrane sheaths after receiving the appropriate signal(s) from the axon or its microenvironment. The signals required to initiate this process are unknown. Here, we show that oligodendrocytes secrete small membrane vesicles, exosome-like vesicles, into the extracellular space that inhibit both the morphological differentiation of oligodendrocytes and myelin formation. The inhibitory effects of exosome-like vesicles were prevented by treatment with inhibitors of actomyosin contractility. Importantly, secretion of exosome-like vesicles from oligodendrocytes was dramatically reduced when cells were incubated by conditioned neuronal medium. In conclusion, our results provide new evidence for small and diffusible oligodendroglial-derived vesicular carriers within the extracellular space that have inhibitory properties on cellular growth. We propose that neurons control the secretion of autoinhibitory oligodendroglial-derived exosomes to coordinate myelin membrane biogenesis."

The IFN-γ-regulated transcription factors STAT1/IRF-1 have apparently divergent effects on β-cells. Thus, STAT1 promotes apoptosis and inflammation, whereas IRF-1 down-regulates inflammatory mediators. To understand the molecular basis for these differential outcomes within a single signal transduction pathway, we presently characterized the gene networks regulated by STAT1 and IRF-1 in β-cells. This was done by using siRNA approaches coupled to microarray analysis of insulin-producing cells exposed or not to IL-1β and IFN-γ. Relevant microarray findings were further studied in INS-1E cells and primary rat β-cells. STAT1, but not IRF-1, mediates the cytokine-induced loss of the differentiated β-cell phenotype, as indicated by decreased insulin, Pdx1, MafA, and Glut2. Furthermore, STAT1 regulates cytokine-induced apoptosis via up-regulation of the proapoptotic protein DP5. STAT1 and IRF-1 have opposite effects on cytokine-induced chemokine production, with IRF-1 exerting negative feedback inhibition on STAT1 and downstream chemokine expression. The present study elucidates the transcriptional networks through which the IFN-γ/STAT1/IRF-1 axis controls β-cell function/differentiation, demise, and islet inflammation.

The present study elucidates the transcriptional networks through which the IFN-γ/STAT1/IRF-1 axis controls β-cell function/differentiation, demise, and islet inflammation. Stressful signals are sensed by cells, which respond via the up- or down-regulation of relevant genes and proteins. This process can be divided in two broad steps; first, cells encode the stress signals internally by modulating the expression, activation, and localization of transcription factors, and second, these transcription factors trigger the expression of key downstream genes that mediate diverse cellular responses to the stress (1Cai L. Dalal C.K. Elowitz M.B. Nature. 2008; 455: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 2Estruch F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2000; 24: 469-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Signaling events occurring inside the pancreatic β-cells and triggered by diverse stressful mediators are decisive for the survival or death of these cells in type 1 diabetes (T1D) 4The abbreviations used are: T1D, type 1 diabetes; ANOVA, analysis of variance; Ad, adenovirus; si, small interfering; F, forward; R, reverse; RT, real-time (PCR); Std, standard. (3Eizirik D.L. Moore F. Flamez D. Ortis F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). T1D is an inflammatory disorder characterized by infiltration of autoreactive immune cells in pancreatic islets (a process termed insulitis) and by selective destruction of insulin-producing β-cells (4Gepts W. Diabetes. 1965; 14: 619-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). β-cell death in T1D occurs through apoptosis induced by a deadly “dialogue” between β-cells and infiltrating immune cells, where the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IFN-γ, and TNF-α produced by infiltrating macrophages and T cells play a key role (5Cnop M.

Apoptosis. 2009; 14: 1389-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that pancreatic β-cells respond to the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α, and IFN-γ by modifying the expression of complex gene networks under the regulation of at least two master transcription factors, namely NF-κB and STAT1 (3Eizirik D.L. Moore F. Flamez D. Ortis F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 5Cnop M. Welsh N. Jonas J.C. Jörns A. Lenzen S. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2005; 54: S97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). Inhibition of NF-κB expression in vitro or in vivo prevents cytokine-induced β-cell apoptosis (9Eldor R. Yeffet A. Baum K.

Heimberg H. Heremans Y. Leeman R. Kutlu B. Kruhøffer M. Ørntoft T. Eizirik D.L. J. Biol.

Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 452-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Such information would be of particular interest for STAT1-regulated genes, because the IFN-γ-induced transcription factors STAT1 and downstream IRF-1 have been reported to exert opposite effects in β-cells. Thus, although STAT1 blockade prevents cytokine-induced β-cell death in vitro and diabetes induced by multiple low doses of streptozotocin (14Callewaert H.I. Gysemans C.A. Ladrière L. D'Hertog W. Hagenbrock J. Overbergh L. Eizirik D.L. Mathieu C. Diabetes. 2007; 56: 2169-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 15Gysemans C.A. Ladrière L. Callewaert H. Rasschaert J. Flamez D. Levy D.E. Matthys P. Eizirik D.L. Mathieu C. Diabetes. 2005; 54: 2396-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), IRF-1 deficiency does not protect β-cells against cytokines in vitro. On the contrary, it actually exacerbates local production of chemokines, islet graft infiltration, and rejection in non-obese diabetic mice (16Gysemans C. Callewaert H. Moore F. Nelson-Holte M. Overbergh L. Eizirik D.L. Mathieu C. Diabetologia. 2009; 52: 2374-2384Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that although STAT1 regulates genes triggering β-cell death and inflammation, IRF-1 may regulate putative anti-inflammatory genes. The nature of these genes, however, remains to be clarified. IRF-1 is induced by IFN-γ through binding of STAT1 to the IRF-1 promoter, but other transcription factors, such as NF-κB, may also induce its expression (17Kröger A. Köster M. Schroeder K. Hauser H. Mueller P.P. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 18Liu L. Paul A. MacKenzie C.J. Bryant C. Graham A. Plevin R. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 1629-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To characterize the broad network of genes regulated by STAT1 and IRF-1, we first validated siRNAs targeting each of these transcription factors and then coupled RNA interference to global evaluation of gene expression. This was done by the use of microarray analysis of insulin-producing INS-1E cells exposed or not to proinflammatory cytokines. These microarray findings were subsequently confirmed in INS-1E and primary rat β-cells, and the function of novel STAT1- and IRF-1-dependent genes characterized by RNA interference and additional functional studies. We observed that STAT1, but not IRF-1, up-regulates the proapoptotic protein DP5 (death protein 5/Hrk) and the synthesis of several proinflammatory chemokines, including the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9, -10, and -11, whereas down-regulating genes involved in β-cell differentiation and function. On the other hand, IRF-1 induces many genes independently of STAT1, including IL-6RA, PKIα, or TAP binding protein. Interestingly, our data highlighted a novel role for IRF-1 in providing a negative feedback on STAT1-driven chemokine production through the induction of the regulatory protein SOCS-1. As a whole, these findings allow us to propose a unifying hypothesis explaining the effects of the transcription factors STAT1 and IRF-1 on β-cells. The siRNAs used in this study are BLOCK-iT StealthTM Select siRNA (Invitrogen) and had the following sequences: siSTAT1 (primer 1), 5′-CCCUAGAAGACUUACAAGAUGAAUA-3′; siSTAT1 (primer 2), 5′-CCAGGCUUGGUGAUUGACCUUGAGA-3′; siIRF-1 (primer 1), 5′-GCCCUCCAUUCAGGCUAUUCCUUGU-3′; siIRF-1 (primer 2), 5′-CCCUGGCUAGAGAUGCAGAUUAAUU-3′; siSOCS-1 (primer 1), 5′-CCGGUACUCCGUGACUACCUGAGUU-3′; and siSOCS-1 (primer 2), 5′-GAGAACCUGGCACGCAUCCCUCUUA-3′. Allstars Negative Control siRNA was used for control-transfected conditions (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands; sequence not provided). The concentration of siRNA used for cell transfection (30 nm) was selected based on dose-response studies (supplemental Fig. 2) (19Moore F. Colli M.L. Cnop M. Esteve M.I. Cardozo A.K. Cunha D.A. Bugliani M. Marchetti P. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). DharmaFECT 1 (Thermo Scientific) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) lipid reagents were used for siRNA transfection (19Moore F. Colli M.L. Cnop M. Esteve M.I. Cardozo A.K. Cunha D.A. Bugliani M. Marchetti P. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The efficiency of transfection and the results are similar for both lipid reagents. After transfection, cells were cultured for a 24-h recovery period and subsequently exposed to cytokines. The following cytokine concentrations were used, based on previous dose-response experiments (6Eizirik D.L. Mandrup-Poulsen T.

Reinolds, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD) at 10 units/ml; recombinant rat IFN-γ (specific activity, 2 × 107 units/mg; R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK) at 100 units/ml; recombinant murine TNF-α (specific activity, 2 × 108 units/mg; Innogenetics, Gent, Belgium) at 1.000 units/ml. Culture supernatants were collected for nitrite determination at an A540 nm using the Griess method. (Nitrite is a stable product of NO oxidation). Total RNA was isolated from INS-1E using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Aminoallyl antisense-cRNA was obtained, coupled to either fluorophore indocarbocyanine (Cy3) or indodicarbocyanine (Cy5) (Amersham Biosciences) and prepared for hybridization (21Magnusson N.E. Cardozo A.K. Kruhøffer M. Eizirik D.L. Ørntoft T.F. Jensen J.L. BMC Bioinformatics. 2005; 6: 311Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The gene expression profiling study was performed using the GeneChip® Rat Genome 230 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix) containing >31,000 probe sets and covering >28,000 well defined rat genes. Gene expression values were calculated from the Affymetrix Cel files using the robust multichip average algorithm (22Irizarry R.A. Bolstad B.M. Collin F. Cope L.M. Hobbs B. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (4024) Google Scholar) implemented in the ArrayAssist® Expression software (Stratagene). Only probe sets detected as “present” by the Affymetrix MAS5 normalization algorithm in at least two of eight conditions for at least one time point were considered as present and used for further analysis. The robust multichip average algorithm normalized intensities corresponding to the 21,569 filtered probe sets were then imported to the Bioconductor free software where a robust Welch's t test (based on robust estimators of central tendency and dispersion, namely the median and the interquartile range) was applied to compare each experimental condition at different time points (2, 12, or 24 h) to the corresponding control. Probe sets were considered as differentially expressed between two conditions if they had a mean fold change (up or down) >1.5 and a p value <0.02. Lists of cytokine-modified probe sets at each time point included those that were significantly modified when comparing both cytokine-treated to untreated untransfected INS-1E cells and cytokine-treated si-control-transfected to untreated siControl-transfected INS-1E cells. Cytokine-modified probe sets were considered as STAT1-dependent when they were significantly modified when comparing cytokine-treated siSTAT1-transfected and cytokine-treated siControl-transfected samples. Cytokine-regulated and IRF1-dependent probe sets were defined in the same way, by comparing cytokine-treated siIRF1-transfected cells with cytokine-treated siControl-transfected INS1-E cells at each time point. The complete array data will be deposited after publication of this article in the EuroDia database. Cells were washed, lysed, resolved by 8–10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane as described (19Moore F. Colli M.L. Cnop M. Esteve M.I. Cardozo A.K. Cunha D.A. Bugliani M. Marchetti P. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2009; 58: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The antibodies used were as follows: anti-STAT1 (catalog no. sc-346) and anti-IRF-1 (catalog no. sc-640) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); antiphospho-STAT1 (Tyr701; catalog no. 9171) from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA); anti-PTPN2 (clone 252294) from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK), and anti-α-tubulin (product no. T9026) from Sigma. HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Lucron Bioproducts, De Pinte, Belgium) were used as secondary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were revealed using the SuperSignal West Femto chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific), detected using a LAS-3000 CCD camera and quantified with the Aida Analysis software (Fujifilm). Male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, Brussels, Belgium) were housed and used according to the guidelines of the Belgian Regulations for Animal Care. Islets were isolated by collagenase digestion and hand picked under a stereomicroscope. β-cells were purified by autofluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACSAria, BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA) (50Rasschaert J.

Cells were left uninfected or infected either with Ad-Luc (luciferase-expressing virus) or Ad-srIκB (a virus expressing an NF-κB super repressor protein) (23Heimberg H. Heremans Y. Jobin C. Leemans R. Cardozo A.K. Darville M. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2219-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Cells were infected for 2 h at 37 °C with a multiplicity of infection of 10. The multiplicity of infection was selected based on lowest toxicity by viral infection combined with highest blockade of NF-κB activation. After infection (24 h), cells were treated with cytokines. We have shown previously that infection of β-cells with Ad-srIκB at the multiplicity of infection used in the present study does not change its function (23Heimberg H. Heremans Y. Jobin C. Leemans R.

Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 1867-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The expression vectors pCMV-STAT1 (Imagene) and pCMV-IRF-1 (Thermo Scientific) were transfected in INS-1E cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as described previously (10Ortis F. Pirot P. Naamane N. Kreins A.Y. Rasschaert J. Moore F. Théâtre E. Verhaeghe C. Magnusson N.E. Chariot A. Orntoft T.F. Eizirik D.L. Diabetologia. 2008; 51: 1213-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). After overnight incubation, the medium was changed, and cells were exposed to cytokines as indicated. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Comparisons were performed by two-tailed paired Student's t test or by ANOVA followed by Student's t test with Bonferroni correction. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Transfection of siRNAs targeting STAT1 and IRF-1 (siSTAT1 and siIRF-1) respectively inhibited IL-1β and IFN-γ-induced STAT1 and IRF-1 induction by 89 and 72% (Fig. 1, A–C). STAT1 silencing also inhibited cytokine-induced IRF-1 expression, which was expected because IRF-1 is a downstream target of STAT1 (Fig. 1, A and C). An irrelevant siRNA used as control (si-control) did not modify IRF-1 or STAT1 expressions. STAT1 silencing potently inhibited IL-1β and IFN-γ-induced apoptosis after 12 and 24 h, whereas neither si-control nor siIRF-1 protected INS-1E cells (Fig. 1D). This was confirmed by a second method that detects cytoplasmic fragmented DNA (Fig. 1E). Both IRF-1 and STAT1 silencing decreased NO production by 38–48% and 27–35% after 12 and 24 h of treatment, respectively (Fig. 1F). Transfection of siSTAT1 and siIRF-1 in primary β-cell decreased cytokine-induced STAT1 and IRF-1 expressions by 72–87% and 70–89%, respectively (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). STAT1 silencing did not affect IRF-1 expression in primary β-cells (supplemental Fig. 1B), suggesting that IRF-1 expression is less dependent on STAT1 in primary cells. NF-κB also contributed to cytokine-induced IRF-1 up-regulation in β-cells, as the addition of IL-1β or TNF-α (both NF-κB activators) augmented IFN-γ-induced IRF-1 induction in INS-1E cells (supplemental Fig. 1, C and D), whereas an NF-κB blockade using a super-repressor IκBα (23Heimberg H. Heremans Y. Jobin C. Leemans R. Cardozo A.K. Darville M. Eizirik D.L. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2219-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) inhibited cytokine-induced IRF-1 expression (supplemental Fig. 1E). STAT1 knockdown also protected primary β-cells against IL-1β and IFN-γ-induced apoptosis, whereas both siIRF-1 and siSTAT1 inhibited cytokine-induced NO production (Fig. 1, G and H). This suggests that protection induced by STAT1 knockdown is at least in part independent on NO production. Similar findings were observed in INS-1E cells using additional siRNAs for each target gene (siIRF-1 primer 2 and siSTAT1 primer 2, supplemental Fig. 2), with siSTAT1 primers 1 and 2 protecting INS-1E cells against both IL-1β and IFN-γ and TNF-α and IFN-γ-induced apoptosis (supplemental Fig. 2). INS-1E cells were left untransfected or transfected with si-control, siIRF-1, or siSTAT1, and subsequently treated with IL-1β and IFN-γ for 2, 12, or 24 h (Fig. 2A). In the microarray analysis, 21.569 probe sets corresponding to 10.874 annotated genes were detected as present. The complete list of probe sets present for each time point is provided as supplemental Tables 2, 3, and 4. Less than 0.5% of the genes were differentially regulated between the untransfected and si-control-transfected conditions, suggesting that the transfection per se had only minor influence on the cells (Fig. 2E). STAT1 silencing affected the expression of 2.6–2.9% of the genes in untreated cells, suggesting a role for STAT1 in the control of basal β-cell function (supplemental Table 5). Cytokine treatment in untransfected and si-control-transfected conditions regulated 21–24% and 14–18% of the genes at 12 and 24 h, respectively (Fig. 2E and supplemental Tables 3 and 4), whereas only ∼5% of the genes were regulated by cytokines at 2 h (Fig. 2E and supplemental Table 2). At 12 h, ∼50% of cytokine-regulated genes were at least partially modified by IRF-1 or STAT1 knockdown (Fig. 2C), whereas at 24 h, 42 and 58% of the cytokine-regulated genes were IRF-1- or STAT1-dependent, respectively (Fig. 2D). The effects of siSTAT1 and siIRF-1 on cytokine-induced genes showed only partial superposition, with 18–33% of the genes regulated by only IRF-1 or STAT1 at 24 h (Fig. 2D). Analysis using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software revealed that functions associated with cell cycle and development, inflammatory response, and endocrine system disorder were significantly affected by STAT1 silencing (supplemental Fig. 3A). Interestingly, cytokine-regulated functions such as cell death, antimicrobial response, inflammatory response, and antigen presentation were affected by IRF-1 deficiency, suggesting an inhibitory role of IRF-1 in these processes (supplemental Fig. 3A). Canonical pathways regulated by cytokines, including HMGB1, NF-κB, and IL-17 signaling, death receptor, and apoptosis signaling were significantly altered by STAT1 knockdown (supplemental Fig. 3B). Supplemental Table 1 represents selected genes with a putative role in β-cell function/dysfunction and death using a method described previously (24Ortis F. Naamane N. Flamez D. Ladrière L. Moore F.

Based on both the “handmade” and unbiased analysis, we selected three pathways of high relevance in the context of T1D, namely β-cell function/differentiation, apoptosis, and inflammation for additional studies. Exposure of the β-cell to cytokines decreases the expression of genes involved in β-cell differentiation and function (24Ortis F. Naamane N. Flamez D. Ladrière L. Moore F. Cunha D.A. Colli M.L.

The present microarray analysis confirmed these findings, since genes such as insulin, Glut2, glucokinase, Pdx1, MafA, and others were significantly down-regulated after 12 and 24 h of IL-1β and IFN-γ exposure (Fig. 3, A–D). Importantly, STAT1 silencing partially prevented the down-regulation of several of these genes, including insulin, Glut2, glucokinase, proconvertase 1 and 3 (Fig. 3, A and B), and all of the transcription factors involved in β-cell differentiation (Fig. 3, C and D). IRF-1 knockdown prevented the down-regulation of proconvertase 1, glucokinase, Pdx1, and Nkx2.2 at 12 h of cytokine (Fig. 3, A and C), but this protective effect was lost at 24 h (Fig. 3, B and D).

Although increased release of endothelial microparticles (MP) correlates with malaria severity, the full extent of vascular cell vesiculation remains unknown. Here, we characterize the pattern of cell-specific MP in patients with severe malaria. We tested the hypothesis that systemic vascular activation contributes to CM by examining origins and levels of plasma MP in relation to clinical syndromes, disease severity and outcome. Patients recruited in Douala, Cameroon, were assigned to clinical groups following WHO criteria. MP quantitation and phenotyping were carried out using cell-specific markers by flow cytometry using antibodies recognizing cell-specific surface markers. Platelet, erythrocytic, endothelial and leukocytic MP levels were elevated in patients with cerebral dysfunctions and returned to normal by discharge. In CM patients, platelet MP were the most abundant and their levels significantly correlated with coma depth and thrombocytopenia. This study shows for the first time a widespread enhancement of vesiculation in the vascular compartment appears to be a feature of CM but not of SA. Our data underpin the role of MP as a biomarker of neurological involvement in severe malaria. Therefore, intervention to block MP production in severe malaria may provide a new therapeutic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1965655823,"Background The sudden emergence of novel influenza viruses is a global public health concern. Conventional influenza vaccines targeting the highly variable surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase must antigenically match the emerging strain to be effective. In contrast, “universal” vaccines targeting conserved viral components could be used regardless of viral strain or subtype. Previous approaches to universal vaccination have required protracted multi-dose immunizations. Here we evaluate a single dose universal vaccine strategy using recombinant adenoviruses (rAd) expressing the conserved influenza virus antigens matrix 2 and nucleoprotein. Methodology/Principal Findings In BALB/c mice, administration of rAd via the intranasal route was superior to intramuscular immunization for induction of mucosal responses and for protection against highly virulent H1N1, H3N2, or H5N1 influenza virus challenge. Mucosally vaccinated mice not only survived, but had little morbidity and reduced lung virus titers. Protection was observed as early as 2 weeks post-immunization, and lasted at least 10 months, as did antibodies and lung T cells with activated phenotypes. Virus-specific IgA correlated with but was not essential for protection, as demonstrated in studies with IgA-deficient animals. Conclusion/Significance Mucosal administration of NP and M2-expressing rAd vectors provided rapid and lasting protection from influenza viruses in a subtype-independent manner. Such vaccines could be used in the interval between emergence of a new virus strain and availability of strain-matched vaccines against it. This strikingly effective single-dose vaccination thus represents a candidate off-the-shelf vaccine for emergency use during an influenza pandemic."

Genetic studies indicate that Grx3/4 and Fra2 regulate activity of the iron-responsive transcription factors Aft1 and Aft2 in response to mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. We have previously shown that Fra2 and Grx3/4 form a [2Fe-2S]2+-bridged heterodimeric complex with iron ligands provided by the active site cysteine of Grx3/4, glutathione, and a histidine residue. To further characterize this unusual Fe-S-binding complex, site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify specific residues in Fra2 that influence Fe-S cluster binding and regulation of Aft1 activity in vivo. Here, we present spectroscopic evidence that His-103 in Fra2 is an Fe-S cluster ligand in the Fra2-Grx3 complex. Replacement of this residue does not abolish Fe-S cluster binding, but it does lead to a change in cluster coordination and destabilization of the [2Fe-2S] cluster. In vivo genetic studies further confirm that Fra2 His-103 is critical for control of Aft1 activity in response to the cellular iron status. Using CD spectroscopy, we find that ∼1 mol eq of apo-Fra2 binds tightly to the [2Fe-2S] Grx3 homodimer to form the [2Fe-2S] Fra2-Grx3 heterodimer, suggesting a mechanism for formation of the [2Fe-2S] Fra2-Grx3 heterodimer in vivo.

IntroductionAlthough iron is a cofactor for many essential proteins, an excess of this redox-active metal ion is toxic to cells. To maintain optimal intracellular iron levels, iron homeostasis is tightly regulated in all eukaryotic cells ranging from yeast to humans. Transcription of iron uptake and storage genes in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae is regulated by the iron-responsive transcriptional activator Aft1 and its paralogue Aft2 (1Yamaguchi-Iwai Y.

Under iron-replete conditions, Aft1 is mainly cytosolic, and under iron-deplete conditions, Aft1 accumulates in the nucleus where it activates genes involved in iron uptake and transport, collectively known as the iron regulon (4Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ueta R. Fukunaka A. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18914-18918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Interestingly, activation of the iron regulon by Aft1 and Aft2 does not respond directly to cytosolic iron but rather to mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis via a signaling pathway that includes the cytosolic proteins Fra1, Fra2, Grx3, and Grx4 (5Kumánovics A.

In the absence of the Fra2-Grx 2The abbreviations used are: GrxglutaredoxinEXAFSextended x-ray absorption fine structure. signaling complex, Aft1 exhibits constitutive activation in both low and high iron growth conditions. Thus, the Fra-Grx complex inhibits Aft1 (and presumably Aft2) activation of the iron regulon when intracellular iron levels are sufficient and mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biogenesis is functional. However, the specific role of the Fra-Grx complex and the precise mechanism of iron-dependent inhibition of Aft1/2 activity are still unclear.To better understand this signaling pathway, we recently characterized the molecular interactions between Fra2 and Grx3/4 (9Li H. Mapolelo D.T. Dingra N.N. Naik S.G. Lees N.S. Hoffman B.M. Riggs-Gelasco P.J. Huynh B.H. Johnson M.K. Outten C.E. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9569-9581Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Fra2 forms heterodimers with Grx3 or Grx4 with a [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster bound at the interface ligated by both cysteine and histidine residues. The spectroscopic characteristics of these complexes are distinct from [2Fe-2S]2+-bridged Grx3 or Grx4 homodimers, which bind the Fe-S cluster with all Cys residues provided by Grx3/4 and two glutathione (GSH) molecules, similar to other members of the monothiol Grx family (10Bandyopadhyay S. Gama F. Molina-Navarro M.M. Gualberto J.M. Claxton R. Naik S.G. Huynh B.H. Herrero E. Jacquot J.P. Johnson M.K. Rouhier N.

Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6041-6043Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Grx3 mutagenesis studies demonstrate that Cys-176, located in the conserved Grx-like domain active site (CGFS), and residues in the GSH binding pocket (Trp-214/Pro-215) are also required for heterodimer formation and cluster binding. These same residues are indispensable for iron-dependent inhibition of Aft1 activity in vivo (6Ojeda L. Keller G. Muhlenhoff U. Rutherford J.C. Lill R. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17661-17669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), suggesting that there is a direct link between the formation of the [2Fe-2S] Fra2-Grx3/4 complex and their in vivo role in iron signaling.Biophysical and biochemical analyses of [2Fe-2S] Fra2-Grx3/4 complexes also demonstrate the presence of a single histidine ligand for the cluster, which is presumably provided by Fra2. Because there have been no published studies identifying specific Fra2 residues required for interaction with Grx3/4 and regulation of Aft1/2 function in vivo, this study is aimed at identifying potential Fe-S-binding ligands on Fra2 and gauging their role in regulating Aft1/2 activity. Here, we present mutagenesis, spectroscopic, genetic, and biochemical evidence that His-103 in Fra2 is an Fe-S cluster ligand and plays an indispensable role in Aft1 regulation in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that apo-Fra2 binds tightly to [2Fe-2S] Grx3 to form the [2Fe-2S] Fra2-Grx3 heterodimer, suggesting a possible mechanism for formation of this iron regulatory complex in vivo. Mutation of His-103 does not interfere in Fra2 binding to the [2Fe-2S] Grx3 homodimer, suggesting that this residue is critical for a different step in the yeast iron signaling pathway. Overall, these results provide a more detailed picture of the Fra2-Grx3 interaction and support a model in which Fra2 acts as an adaptor protein converting Grx3 from an Fe-S scaffold/delivery protein with a relatively labile cluster to an iron sensor with a stable cluster.DISCUSSIONThe cytosolic proteins Fra2 and Grx3/4 relay cellular iron status to the transcriptional activators Aft1 and Aft2 via an unknown mechanism (5Kumánovics A. Chen O.S. Li L. Bagley D. Adkins E.M. Lin H. Dingra N.N. Outten C.E. Keller G. Winge D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4554-4564Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). We sought to characterize the physical and functional interactions between Fra2 and Grx3/4 to ultimately uncover this mechanism for sensing and regulating intracellular iron levels in yeast. Our previous results demonstrated that these proteins form a novel [2Fe-2S]-bridged heterodimeric complex with the Fe-S cluster ligated at the heterodimer interface by a conserved Cys in the CGFS active site motif of Grx3/4 and a Cys from GSH. The identities of the other ligands were unclear; however, the spectroscopic evidence indicated that the Fe-S cluster is ligated by one histidine, presumably provided by Fra2 (9Li H. Mapolelo D.T. Dingra N.N. Naik S.G. Lees N.S. Hoffman B.M. Riggs-Gelasco P.J. Huynh B.H. Johnson M.K. Outten C.E. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9569-9581Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis coupled with biochemical and spectroscopic characterization, we confirm here that His-103 in Fra2 is an Fe-S cluster ligand in the Fra2-Grx3 complex. Mutation of this residue causes a change in the Fe-S cluster coordination that results in destabilization of the Fe-S cluster. Furthermore, in vivo studies demonstrate that replacement of His-103 in Fra2 disrupts iron-dependent inhibition of Aft1 activity, suggesting that the histidine coordination and the resultant stability of the Fe-S cluster in the Fra2-Grx3/4 complex are critical for its in vivo role in iron regulation.Despite identification of the two Cys ligands provided by GSH and Grx3, and the His ligand from Fra2, the nature of the fourth ligand in the [2Fe-2S] Fra2-Grx3/4 heterodimer is still unclear. Our previously published results ruled out an additional His ligand, a second GSH molecule, and an additional Cys residue provided by Grx3/4 (9Li H. Mapolelo D.T. Dingra N.N. Naik S.G. Lees N.S. Hoffman B.M. Riggs-Gelasco P.J. Huynh B.H. Johnson M.K. Outten C.E. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9569-9581Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Cys-66 in Fra2 was a likely candidate tested in this study, yet mutation of this residue has no effect on Fra2-Grx3 heterodimer formation or the in vivo function of Fra2. Because Grx3/4 interacts with both Aft1 and the Fra1-Fra2 complex in vivo (5Kumánovics A. Chen O.S. Li L. Bagley D. Adkins E.M. Lin H. Dingra N.N. Outten C.E. Keller G. Winge D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 17661-17669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), it is possible that Aft1 or Fra1 provides the fourth cluster ligand under physiological conditions. In the absence of these interacting proteins, water or another residue from Grx3/4 or Fra2 may occupy this ligation site. Additional biochemical and structural studies will be required to resolve this issue.Given the data presented in this study, why is His-103 important for the regulatory function of [2Fe-2S] Fra2-Grx3/4? Interestingly, our results demonstrate that replacement of the conserved His ligand in Fra2 does not prohibit Fe-S cluster binding to Fra2-Grx3 or prevent tight binding of apo-Fra2 with [2Fe-2S] Grx3 homodimers. However, unlike the WT heterodimer, the [2Fe-2S] in Grx3-Fra2(H103A/C) heterodimers is rapidly degraded upon reduction with dithionite indicating that the Fe-S cluster stability is compromised in these mutants complexes. Furthermore, the EXAFS analysis presented in this work suggests that cluster destabilization results from expansion of the Fe-S cluster dimensions for Grx3-Fra2(H103A/C) mutants. These results thus suggest that a stable and/or redox-active cluster may be important for the in vivo function of Fra2-Grx3/4. These results also lead to the question of how [2Fe-2S] Fra2-Grx3/4 influences the transcriptional activity of Aft1/2. As mentioned earlier, the Fra-Grx signaling pathway is proposed to induce oligomerization of Aft1 (and presumably Aft2) under iron-replete conditions (5Kumánovics A. Chen O.S. Li L. Bagley D. Adkins E.M. Lin H. Dingra N.N. Outten C.E. Keller G. Winge D. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10276-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 33Ueta R.

This conformational change, in turn, may promote export of Aft1/2 from the nucleus or prevent interaction of Aft1/2 with the target DNA. Although genetic and biochemical evidence demonstrates that the interactions between Fra2-Grx3/4 and Fra1-Fra2 are not strictly iron-dependent (5Kumánovics A. Chen O.S. Li L. Bagley D. Adkins E.M.

Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9569-9581Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation studies indicate that the physical interactions between Grx3/4-Aft1 and Aft1-Aft1 are dependent on the Fe-S binding Cys of Grx3/4 and the conserved Cys-Xaa-Cys motif of Aft1 (6Ojeda L.

Taken together, these observations strongly suggest a role for redox chemistry or metal binding in control of Aft1 function. For example, [2Fe-2S] Fra2-Grx3/4 may catalyze redox modification of the Cys-Xaa-Cys motif or transfer iron or an Fe-S cluster to Aft1/2. If the Fra2-Grx3/4 heterodimer has redox activity, replacement of the His ligand is likely to significantly alter the redox potential and pH dependence of the Fe-S cluster as demonstrated for other His-ligated [2Fe-2S] cluster proteins (30Kounosu A. Li Z. Cosper N.J. Shokes J.E. Scott R.A. Imai T. Urushiyama A. Iwasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12519-12528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 34Bak D.W.

Alternatively, the histidine-ligated [2Fe-2S] cluster may allow the Fra2-Grx3/4 complex to adopt a conformation that facilitates stable complex formation with Aft1/2 or other components of the iron-sensing pathway (e.g. Fra1), which ultimately inhibits Aft1/2 transcriptional activity. Unraveling the nature of the molecular interactions between Fra2, Grx3/4, Fra1, and Aft1/2 and their effect on the structure, subcellular localization, and DNA binding activity of Aft1/2 will be key in understanding the mechanism of iron regulation in yeast.Because the Grx3/4 and Fra2 residues required for iron-dependent control of Aft1 activity are specifically required for binding the Fe-S cluster in the Fra2-Grx3 heterodimer, these results provide strong evidence that the iron regulon in yeast is controlled by the ability of the Fra2-Grx3/4 complex to assemble a stable histidine-ligated [2Fe-2S] cluster. How is the [2Fe-2S] Fra2-Grx3/4 complex formed in vivo? Previous genetic studies demonstrate that control of the yeast iron regulon is dependent on mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biogenesis rather than cytosolic iron levels (8Rutherford J.C. Ojeda L. Balk J. Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10135-10140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The Fe-S-dependent signal emanating from the mitochondria is proposed to be an unknown sulfur-containing species exported by the mitochondrial ABC transporter Atm1. Whether or not this species is involved in assembly of a [2Fe-2S] cluster on Fra2-Grx3/4 heterodimers or Grx3/4 homodimers is unclear. However, the available evidence demonstrates that the cytosolic Fe-S cluster assembly (CIA) machinery is not required for iron signaling (8Rutherford J.C. Ojeda L. Balk J. Mühlenhoff U. Lill R. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10135-10140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), suggesting that a parallel pathway exists for assembly of Fe-S clusters on Fra2-Grx3/4 heterodimers and Grx3/4 homodimers.It is interesting to note that the phenotypes for grx3Δgrx4Δ mutants are significantly different from fra2Δ mutants. Although both mutant strains exhibit misregulation of the iron regulon, grx3Δgrx4 mutants are sensitive to peroxides, accumulate high levels of intracellular iron, and grow poorly on synthetic medium (6Ojeda L.

These results suggest that the cytosolic CGFS-type Grxs play an additional role beyond iron sensing and regulation. Chloroplast and mitochondrial monothiol Grxs (Grx5 in yeast) are proposed to be involved in assembly, storage, and/or delivery of [2Fe-2S] clusters (10Bandyopadhyay S. Gama F. Molina-Navarro M.M.

Although this function has not been established for cytosolic Grxs, yeast Grx3 and Grx4 can partially rescue the Fe-S cluster biogenesis and growth defects of yeast grx5Δ mutants when artificially targeted to the mitochondria, suggesting a conservation of function among proteins in the CGFS-type Grx family (38Molina M.M.

If yeast Grx3 and Grx4 do play a role in cytosolic [2Fe-2S] cluster biogenesis or trafficking, the levels of [2Fe-2S] cluster-bound Grx3/4 can be assessed by interaction with Fra2 without perturbing Grx3/4 function provided that Fra2 can replace one of the Grx molecules in the homodimer with high binding affinity and the cellular concentration of Fra2 is much less than that of Grx3 or Grx4. In fact, the absolute protein abundances of Grx3 (11,000 molecules/cell) and Grx4 (7800 molecules/cell) determined in a proteome-wide study are significantly higher than Fra2 (2050 molecules/cell) (39Ghaemmaghami S.

Hence, the tight and stoichiometric binding of Fra2 to holo-Grx3 to form the Fra2-Grx3 heterodimeric complex that we present here provides a plausible hypothesis for an initial step in the iron or Fe-S cluster sensing mechanism that controls the yeast iron regulon. Changes in the protein levels of Grx3/4 and Fra2 under iron-deplete versus iron-replete conditions may also provide an additional level of control; however, previous results suggest that Fra2, Grx3, and Grx4 protein levels show little variation in response to cytosolic iron levels (5Kumánovics A.

Although the control of the iron regulon via Aft1/2 is unique to yeast, similar types of regulation based on iron or Fe-S cluster sensing are likely to be found in other organisms based on the identification of BolA-type proteins as physiological partners of monothiol Grxs in other organisms (40Couturier J.

IntroductionAlthough iron is a cofactor for many essential proteins, an excess of this redox-active metal ion is toxic to cells. To maintain optimal intracellular iron levels, iron homeostasis is tightly regulated in all eukaryotic cells ranging from yeast to humans. Transcription of iron uptake and storage genes in the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae is regulated by the iron-responsive transcriptional activator Aft1 and its paralogue Aft2 (1Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 2Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Under iron-replete conditions, Aft1 is mainly cytosolic, and under iron-deplete conditions, Aft1 accumulates in the nucleus where it activates genes involved in iron uptake and transport, collectively known as the iron regulon (4Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Ueta R. Fukunaka A. Sasaki R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18914-18918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Interestingly, activation of the iron regulon by Aft1 and Aft2 does not respond directly to cytosolic iron but rather to mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis via a signaling pathway that includes the cytosolic proteins Fra1, Fra2, Grx3, and Grx4 (5Kumánovics A.

The monothiol glutaredoxins Grx3 and Grx4 also interact with Fra2 in addition to Aft1 in vivo (5Kumánovics A. Chen O.S. Li L. Bagley D. Adkins E.M. Lin H. Dingra N.N. Outten C.E. Keller G. Winge D.

In the absence of the Fra2-Grx 2The abbreviations used are: GrxglutaredoxinEXAFSextended x-ray absorption fine structure. signaling complex, Aft1 exhibits constitutive activation in both low and high iron growth conditions. Thus, the Fra-Grx complex inhibits Aft1 (and presumably Aft2) activation of the iron regulon when intracellular iron levels are sufficient and mitochondrial Fe-S cluster biogenesis is functional. However, the specific role of the Fra-Grx complex and the precise mechanism of iron-dependent inhibition of Aft1/2 activity are still unclear.To better understand this signaling pathway, we recently characterized the molecular interactions between Fra2 and Grx3/4 (9Li H. Mapolelo D.T. Dingra N.N. Naik S.G. Lees N.S. Hoffman B.M. Riggs-Gelasco P.J. Huynh B.H. Johnson M.K. Outten C.E. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 9569-9581Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Fra2 forms heterodimers with Grx3 or Grx4 with a [2Fe-2S]2+ cluster bound at the interface ligated by both cysteine and histidine residues. The spectroscopic characteristics of these complexes are distinct from [2Fe-2S]2+-bridged Grx3 or Grx4 homodimers, which bind the Fe-S cluster with all Cys residues provided by Grx3/4 and two glutathione (GSH) molecules, similar to other members of the monothiol Grx family (10Bandyopadhyay S.

Grx3 mutagenesis studies demonstrate that Cys-176, located in the conserved Grx-like domain active site (CGFS), and residues in the GSH binding pocket (Trp-214/Pro-215) are also required for heterodimer formation and cluster binding. These same residues are indispensable for iron-dependent inhibition of Aft1 activity in vivo (6Ojeda L. Keller G. Muhlenhoff U. Rutherford J.C. Lill R. Winge D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17661-17669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), suggesting that there is a direct link between the formation of the [2Fe-2S] Fra2-Grx3/4 complex and their in vivo role in iron signaling.Biophysical and biochemical analyses of [2Fe-2S] Fra2-Grx3/4 complexes also demonstrate the presence of a single histidine ligand for the cluster, which is presumably provided by Fra2. Because there have been no published studies identifying specific Fra2 residues required for interaction with Grx3/4 and regulation of Aft1/2 function in vivo, this study is aimed at identifying potential Fe-S-binding ligands on Fra2 and gauging their role in regulating Aft1/2 activity. Here, we present mutagenesis, spectroscopic, genetic, and biochemical evidence that His-103 in Fra2 is an Fe-S cluster ligand and plays an indispensable role in Aft1 regulation in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that apo-Fra2 binds tightly to [2Fe-2S] Grx3 to form the [2Fe-2S] Fra2-Grx3 heterodimer, suggesting a possible mechanism for formation of this iron regulatory complex in vivo. Mutation of His-103 does not interfere in Fra2 binding to the [2Fe-2S] Grx3 homodimer, suggesting that this residue is critical for a different step in the yeast iron signaling pathway. Overall, these results provide a more detailed picture of the Fra2-Grx3 interaction and support a model in which Fra2 acts as an adaptor protein converting Grx3 from an Fe-S scaffold/delivery protein with a relatively labile cluster to an iron sensor with a stable cluster."
https://openalex.org/W2040994429,"The natural polyphenol resveratrol (RSV) displays a wide spectrum of health beneficial activities, yet the precise mechanisms remain to be fully elucidated. Here we show that RSV promotes the multimerization and cellular levels of adiponectin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The stimulatory effect of RSV was not affected by knocking out Sirt1, but was diminished by suppressing the expression levels of DsbA-L, a recently identified adiponectin-interactive protein that promotes adiponectin multimerization. Suppression of the Akt signaling pathway resulted in an increase in the expression levels of DsbA-L and adiponectin. On the other hand, knocking out FOXO1 or suppressing the activity or expression levels of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) down-regulated DsbA-L and adiponectin. The stimulatory effect of RSV on adiponectin and DsbA-L expression was completely diminished in FOXO1-suppressed and AMPK-inactivated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Taken together, our results demonstrate that RSV promotes adiponectin multimerization in 3T3-L1 adipocytes via a Sirt1-independent mechanism. In addition, we show that the stimulatory effect of RSV is regulated by both the Akt/FOXO1 and the AMPK signaling pathways. Last, we show that DsbA-L plays a critical role in the promoting effect of RSV on adiponectin multimerization and cellular levels."

Healthy volunteers (n=14) were studied immediately before, and within 4 d of return from, a 17-d trek to Mt.

Immediately after returning from Mt. Everest, total body weight had fallen by 3% (P<0.05), but left ventricular mass, adjusted for changes in body surface area, had disproportionately decreased by 11% (P<0.05). Alterations in diastolic function were also observed, with a reduction in peak left ventricular filling rates and mitral inflow E/A, by 17% (P<0.05) and 24% (P<0.01), respectively, with no change in hydration status. Compared with pretrek, cardiac PCr/ATP ratio had decreased by 18% (P<0.01). Whether the abnormalities were even greater at altitude is unknown, but all had returned to pretrek levels after 6 mo. The alterations in cardiac morphology, function, and energetics are similar to findings in patients with chronic hypoxia. Thus, a decrease in cardiac PCr/ATP may be a universal response to periods of sustained low oxygen availability, underlying hypoxia-induced cardiac dysfunction in healthy human heart and in patients with cardiopulmonary diseases.—Holloway, C.

Science. 2006; 311: 1113-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Modulation and perturbation of this quorum-sensing pathway has been demonstrated in principle to be an effective “anti-microbial” strategy (8Dong Y.H. Wang L.H. Xu J.L. Zhang H.B. Zhang X.F.

We are interested in developing quorum-quenching PLLs as anti-virulence therapeutic biomolecules to modulate quorum-sensing pathways of disease-causing microbes. Previous in vitro evolution work yielded a broad-range quorum-quenching mutant lactonase from the mesophile Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis K-10 (MCP) (6Chow J.Y. Wu L. Yew W.S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4344-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This N266Y mutant hydrolyzed AHLs ranging from N-butyryl-l-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL) to N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C12-HSL). However, a lack of thermostability limited the use of this enzyme in biomedical applications. In this article we describe the use of an orthologous PLL from the thermophile Geobacillus kaustophilus (GKL, GI: 56420041) as a template for in vitro evolution of enhanced quorum-quenching activity. GKL was chosen as the template for the in vitro evolution experiments because of its high thermostability, high solubility, and ease of purification. Wild-type GKL retains its catalytic activity even after exposure to incubation temperatures of 60 °C for 72 h, and yields of 200 mg of purified protein per liter of culture were routinely obtainable. Despite its thermostability, GKL was found to exhibit low metal-dependent N-acylhomoserine lactonase activity (kcat/Km of 130 m−1s−1 toward 3-oxo-C12-HSL) and that Zn2+-reconstituted GKL displayed a substrate preference for medium to long-chain AHLs. The C4-HSL-liganded structure of a catalytically inactive GKL mutant (D266N) was determined, and a robust and tunable directed evolution platform to screen for enhanced quorum-quenching activity was constructed, leading to the identification of a mutant, E101N/R230I, with increased catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) against a broad range of AHLs. These mutations are located on loops at the C-terminal ends of the third and seventh β-strand, respectively. The productive geometry of the enzyme active site could be modulated using suitable point mutations directed toward Glu-101 (located on a loop remote from the central catalytic barrel) and Arg-230, providing a structural basis for the catalytic enhancements observed in the in vitro evolved GKL mutant. The substrates C4-HSL, N-hexanoyl-dl-homoserine lactone (C6-HSL), N-(3-oxo-hexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C6-HSL), N-octanoyl-dl-homoserine lactone (C8-HSL), N-(3-oxo-octanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C8-HSL), N-decanoyl-dl-homoserine lactone, γ-nonalactone, δ-nonalactone, and paraoxon were purchased from Sigma. 3-oxo-C12-HSL was purchased from Lier Chemical Co. (Sichuan, China). The chemical structures of these substrates are represented in supplemental Fig. S1). All reagents were the highest quality grade commercially available. The gene encoding GKL (GI: 56420041) was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA isolated from G. kaustophilus HTA426 (a kind gift from Professor John A. Gerlt, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) using the primer pair 5′-GAAAGGGGTGAAATTAATATGGCGGAGATGGTAGAAACGG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CCGACCTTACAAGGATCCTCAAGCCGAGAACAGCGCC-3′ (reverse primer). The amplified gene was cloned into a modified pET-15b vector (Novagen) in which the N terminus contained 10 His residues (9Yew W.S. Gerlt J.A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Transformed cells were grown at 37 °C in LB broth (supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin) to an A600 nm of 0.6, and isopropyl d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mm) was added to induce protein expression for 16 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9), and lysed by sonication. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation, and the His-tagged protein was purified using a column of chelating Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) charged with Ni2+. Cell lysate was applied to the column in binding buffer, washed with buffer containing 154 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and eluted with 100 mm l-histidine, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9. The N-terminal His tag was removed with thrombin (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the proteins were purified to homogeneity on a Q-Sepharose™ High Performance column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) and eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m elution buffer (1 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). Purified GKL was dialyzed against storage buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 10 mm EDTA followed by dialysis in storage buffer to remove excess EDTA. EDTA-treated GKL was sent for inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy metal analysis at the Elemental Analysis Laboratory, Department of Chemistry, National University of Singapore. Metal-reconstituted GKL was prepared by dialysis of EDTA-treated GKL against storage buffer containing 100 μm metal ions (Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+) before inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy analysis. The lactonase activity of GKL was assayed by a continuous spectrophotometric pH indicator assay (described by Chapman and Wong (10Chapman E. Wong C.H. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2002; 10: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to detect the formation of carboxylic acids) using a UV-2550 Spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). Briefly, the assay (1 ml at 37 °C) contained GKL, 2.5 mm Bicine buffer, pH 8.3, 0.08 mm cresol purple (577 nm, ϵ = 12,500 m−1cm−1), 100 μm metal ion (Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, or Zn2+) and 0.025–5 mm AHL or nonalactone substrate (substrates were dissolved in DMSO, and regardless of substrate concentration, the final concentration of organic solvent DMSO was maintained at 1%). Initial rates (νo) were corrected for the background rate of spontaneous substrate hydrolysis in the absence of enzyme. Background rate of substrate nonenzymatic hydrolysis varied among different substrates and concentrations tested but was typically less than 30 milliabsorbance units/min and significantly below observed catalytic rates. Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting the initial rates to the Michaelis-Menten equation using Enzfitter (Biosoft). Paraoxonase activity was assayed as previously described (6Chow J.Y. Wu L. Yew W.S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4344-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); briefly, the assay (1 ml at 37 °C) contained GKL, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 μm ZnCl2, and 0.1–2.5 mm paraoxon (400 nm, ϵ = 17,000 m−1cm−1, 0.25% methanol). The reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically by following the formation of p-nitrophenol at 400 nm. Wild-type GKL and its E101N/R230I mutant were incubated in 2.5 mm Bicine buffer and 100 μm ZnCl2 at either 60 or 90 °C, respectively, for 15 min before the enzyme solutions were cooled and assayed for lactonase activity against 3-oxo-C8 HSL at 37 °C as described above. The mesophilic N266Y MCP mutant was incubated in 2.5 mm Bicine buffer and 100 μm MnCl2 at either 60 or 90 °C, respectively, for 15 min before the enzyme solutions were cooled and assayed for lactonase activity against 3-oxo-C8 HSL at 25 °C as previously described (6Chow J.Y. Wu L. Yew W.S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4344-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To ascertain the extent of thermostability, wild-type GKL was also incubated at 60 °C for 24, 48, and 72 h before being assayed for lactonase activity using δ-nonalactone as substrate. Freshly prepared GKL D266N mutant was concentrated to 45 mg/ml, and C4-HSL was added to a final concentration of 1.0 mm. Crystals grew within 3 days at 20 °C by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method from a 1:1 (v/v) mixture with precipitant solution comprised of 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20% (w/v) PEG 4000, and 1.0 mm ZnCl2. Crystals were soaked in the precipitant solution supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at beamline BL13B1 on an Area Detection System Corp. Quantum-315 CCD detector at the National Synchrotron Research Center (Hsinchu, Taiwan). The wavelength was set at 1 Å, and the data were collected at 105 K. Data were indexed, scaled, and merged in HKL2000 (11Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Charles W. Carter Jr., Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, Inc., 1997: 307-326Google Scholar). Structural determination of GKL D266N mutant was initiated by molecular replacement using GsP, a PLL from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (chain A of Protein Data Bank code 3F4D) as a model in PHASER (12McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14567) Google Scholar). The solution was subjected to repetitive rounds of restrained refinement in PHENIX (13Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J.

Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 486-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (17313) Google Scholar). The density of the bound C4-HSL ligand was evident after the first round of refinement and was further improved after running the automatic ordered solvent protocol in subsequent rounds of refinement. The ligand was then built into the density in COOT. The occupancies of the atoms in the ligand were refined as a group, whereas those of the two metal ions at the active site were refined separately. TLS refinement was included in the final round of refinement (15Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). The final structure was validated with the MOLPROBITY server (16Davis I.W. Leaver-Fay A. Chen V.B. Block J.N. Kapral G.J.

Wu L. Yew W.S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4344-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) as shown in Fig. 1. This previous bioassay utilized an isopropyl d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible high-copy expression plasmid that contributed to significant levels of false positives during the directed evolution process. In the present study the mutant libraries were expressed using a tunable, l-arabinose-inducible low-copy expression plasmid (with a pACYC-based origin of replication) in a sdiA-deficient E. coli strain (JLD271, kindly provided by Professor Brian Ahmer, Ohio State University) (17Lindsay A. Ahmer B.M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5054-5058Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); a reporter cassette carrying the cognate receptor for N-(3-oxo-hexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (LuxR) was integrated into the genome of JLD271 by Tn7-mediated transposition (18Choi K.H. Gaynor J.B. White K.G. Lopez C. Bosio C.M. Karkhoff-Schweizer R.R. Schweizer H.P. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 443-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) to create the reporter strain. The LuxR-LuxCDABE cassette was amplified from pAL103 (17Lindsay A. Ahmer B.M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 5054-5058Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) using the primer pair 5′-GAGAGACTCGAGTTAATTTTTAAAGTATGGGC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CTCTCTGGTACCTCAACTATCAAACGCTTCGG-3′ (reverse primer). The amplified cassette was digested with XhoI and KpnI and subcloned into a pUC18R6K-mini-Tn7T-GmR plasmid (19Choi K.H. Schweizer H.P. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Integration of the cassette was carried out by co-transformation of the constructed vector with the helper plasmid pTNS2, which encodes for the transposase required for site-specific transposition. A modified pBAD33 plasmid (20Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3960) Google Scholar) (in which the multiple-cloning-site is replaced with the corresponding multiple-cloning site from pET17b, Novagen) bearing the GKL gene was introduced into the reporter strain. Single-colony transformants were streaked onto LB plates supplemented with 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 0.002–0.2% arabinose, and AHL substrate. The plates were then incubated overnight at 37 °C, and bioluminescence was detected using a LAS-1000 luminescent image analysis system (Fujifilm). The site-directed single A54T, E101G, D214G, R230C, D266N, and D266A mutants and the various double and triple mutants of GKL were constructed using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene), verified by sequencing, expressed in the BL21(DE3) E. coli cells, and purified as previously described for the wild-type protein. These mutants were also subcloned into the modified pBAD33 vector for quorum-quenching bioassays as previously described. Site-specific random GKL libraries at positions Thr-267, Val-268, Asn-269, Val-270, and Trp-271 (residue Val-268 in GK corresponds to the Asn-266 residue in MCP responsible for enhancement of lactonase activity (6Chow J.Y. Wu L. Yew W.S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4344-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)) were constructed using the QuikChange method, with the primers for construction of the libraries detailed in supplemental Table S1). Library sizes of 1 × 104 transformants per transformation were routinely obtained. The site-specific random GKL libraries were harvested using the QIAprep Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) and transformed into the quorum reporter strain to screen for GKL mutants with increased quorum-quenching activities. The double site-specific random library at positions Glu-101 and Arg-230 was obtained by first constructing the Glu-101 library then using the Glu-101 library as a template for a second QuikChange reaction to randomize the Arg-230 position. The lactonase activity of MCP was previously increased through the construction of loop chimeras (6Chow J.Y. Wu L. Yew W.S. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4344-4353Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); thus, similar chimeras of GKL were constructed with two orthologues from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PPH) and Rhodococcus erythropolis (AhlA) within the PLLs that were reported to have proficient lactonase activity but low solubility, with the hope of improving the lactonase activity of GKL. With the expectation that the binuclear metal centers of GKL, AhlA, and PPH are essentially identical, the specificity loops at the C-terminal ends of the seventh and eighth β-strand were identified from a sequence alignment (detailed in supplemental Fig. S2) based upon the structure of GKL. GKL-AhlA and GKL-PPH chimeras were constructed using the QuikChange method, with the primers for construction of the libraries detailed in the supplemental data (Supplemental Table S1). GKL-AhlA and GKL-PPH chimeras were GKL mutants that had their loops at the C-terminal ends of the seventh and/or eighth β-strands replaced with the corresponding loops from AhlA and PPH, respectively (exact sequences of the loop mutants are detailed in supplemental Fig. S3). These chimeras were verified by DNA sequencing; soluble protein was obtained only for the GKL-PPH β8 chimera, which was purified as previously described for the wild-type enzyme. A randomly generated error-prone PCR library of GKL mutants was constructed using the GeneMorph II random mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Briefly, for each error-prone PCR reaction, 450 ng of GKL template was used to obtain a mutation frequency of ∼3 mutations per kb (determined by sequencing randomly picked transformants). The mutant PCR product was cloned into the modified pBAD33 plasmid and transformed into XL1 Blue E. coli cells. Six transformations resulted in a library size of 8 × 105 transformants. The mutant GK plasmid library was harvested using the QIAprep Miniprep kit (Qiagen) and transformed into the quorum reporter strain to screen for GKL mutants with increased quorum-quenching activities. Colonies with increased quorum-quenching were picked, and the sequences of the mutants were determined by DNA sequencing. 200 mg per liter of culture of purified GKL were routinely obtained; the protein purity was estimated to be greater than 98% as judged from SDS-PAGE analysis. Because GKL is isolated from the thermophile G. kaustophilus and we are interested in using this template to develop anti-virulence biomolecules for use in the human body, all activity assays were conducted at the physiological temperature of 37 °C. Purified GKL was screened for activity against the various lactones in the absence of additional metal ions; however, no lactonase activity was detected. As a member of the amidohydrolase superfamily of enzymes, GKL was expected to demonstrate metal dependence for its lactonase activity. EDTA-treated GKL was found to contain 0.5 eq of iron and 0.1 eq of zinc per active site. EDTA-treated GKL, like non-EDTA-treated GKL, did not have any detectable lactonase activity when assayed in the absence of additional metal ions. The metal dependence of GKL lactonase activity was determined by reconstituting EDTA-treated GKL with the following metal ions: Mg2+, Ca2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+. Using 0.4 mm C8-HSL as substrate, GKL exhibited detectable lactonase activity only with zinc. Zinc-reconstituted GKL was used in subsequent experiments. Zinc-reconstituted GKL was found to contain 0.5 eq of iron and 1.2 eq of zinc per active site. GKL exhibited lactonase activity toward a number of AHL substrates; the values of the kinetic parameters and the identities of the AHL substrates are reported in Table 1. GKL also had low paraoxonase activity (kcat/Km of 4.5 m−1s−1 for paraoxon), indicating that, like other members of the PLLs, the native substrate profile of this enzyme does not involve phosphate esters (5Afriat L. Roodveldt C. Manco G. Tawfik D.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 13677-13686Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 21Xiang D.F. Kolb P. Fedorov A.A. Meier M.M. Fedorov L.V. Nguyen T.T. Sterner R. Almo S.C. Shoichet B.K. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 2237-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Among the selected PLLs, GKL has a significantly higher sequence identity to an orthologous PLL from Deinococcus radiodurans (Dr0930 was reported to hydrolyze γ-nonalactone and δ-nonalactone efficiently but had no detectable activity against AHLs (21Xiang D.F. Kolb P. Fedorov A.A. Meier M.M. Fedorov L.V. Nguyen T.T. Sterner R. Almo S.C. Shoichet B.K. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 2237-2247Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)) than any other reported PLLs (59% amino acid sequence identity; a matrix of pairwise sequence identities between GKL and selected members of the amidohydrolase superfamily is detailed in supplemental Table S2). γ-Nonalactone and δ-nonalactone were hence tested as possible substrates for GKL. Within expectations, GKL exhibited high lactonase activities toward γ-nonalactone and δ-nonalactone (kcat/Km of 1.2 × 105 and 8.4 × 105 m−1s−1, respectively); these values are comparable with those reported for Dr0930 (kcat/Km of 4.2 × 105 and 2.0 × 105 m−1s−1, respectively, for γ-nonalactone and δ-nonalactone). It is noteworthy that although these lactones are commercially available, they are not found in the KEGG data base and are, thus, regarded as “unnatural” substrates.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of GKL and evolved mutantsSubstrateGKLE101G / R230CE101N / R230Ikcat s−1Km mmkcat/Km m−1s−1Kcat s−1Km mmkcat/Km m−1s−1kcat s−1Km mmkcat/Km m−1s−1C4-HSLNDaND, no detectable activity.NDND≤0.009–bApparent kcat.–bApparent kcat.≤ 0.011–bApparent kcat.–bApparent kcat.C6-HSL0.17 ± 0.0112.6 ± 0.31660.20 ± 0.062.4 ± 1.3820.25 ± 0.133.7 ± 3.068C8-HSL0.52 ± 0.0991.2 ± 0.404300.30 ± 0.00860.095 ± 0.0233.2 × 1031.4 ± 0.0940.39 ± 0.0793.7 × 103C10-HSL–cSaturation kinetics could not be attained.–cSaturation kinetics could not be attained.3000.43 ± 0.0920.13 ± 0.0573.3 × 1031.7 ± 0.160.13 ± 0.0261.3 × 1043-oxo-C6-HSL–cSaturation kinetics could not be attained.–cSaturation kinetics could not be attained.4.50.91 ± 0.4226 ± 14350.40 ± 0.139.0 ± 4.1453-oxo-C8-HSL0.29 ± 0.115.9 ± 3.1501.1 ± 0.0743.8 ± 0.412801.8 ± 0.0902.9 ± 0.246403-oxo-C12-HSL–cSaturation kinetics could not be attained.–cSaturation kinetics could not be attained.1302.0 ± 0.850.48 ± 0.284.2 × 1036.9 ± 2.00.74 ± 0.279.3 × 103γ-Nonalactone2.9 ± 0.140.024 ± 0.00541.2 × 10522 ± 2.21.1 ± 0.152.1 × 1042.0 ± 0.150.46 ± 0.0644.3 × 103δ-Nonalactone29 ± 2.20.035 ± 0.0138.4 × 105–cSaturation kinetics could not be attained.–cSaturation kinetics could not be attained.3.9 × 1031.6 ± 0.591.1 ± 0.541.4 × 103Paraoxon(3.1 ± 0.079) × 10−30.69 ± 0.0444.5NDNDNDNDNDNDa ND, no detectable activity.b Apparent kcat.c Saturation kinetics could not be attained.

https://openalex.org/W2062461095,"The vitamin K oxidoreductase (VKOR) reduces vitamin K to support the carboxylation and consequent activation of vitamin K-dependent proteins, but the mechanism of reduction is poorly understood. VKOR is an integral membrane protein that reduces vitamin K using membrane-embedded thiols (Cys-132 and Cys-135), which become oxidized with concomitant VKOR inactivation. VKOR is subsequently reactivated by an unknown redox protein that is currently thought to act directly on the Cys132-Cys135 residues. However, VKOR contains evolutionarily conserved Cys residues (Cys-43 and Cys-51) that reside in a loop outside of the membrane, raising the question of whether they mediate electron transfer from a redox protein to Cys-132/Cys-135. To assess a possible role, the activities of mutants with Ala substituted for Cys (C43A and C51A) were analyzed in intact membranes using reductants that were either membrane-permeable or -impermeable. Both reductants resulted in wild type VKOR reduction of vitamin K epoxide; however, the C43A and C51A mutants only showed activity with the membrane-permeant reductant. We obtained similar results when testing the ability of wild type and mutant VKORs to support carboxylation, using intact membranes from cells coexpressing VKOR and carboxylase. These results indicate a role for Cys-43 and Cys-51 in catalysis, suggesting a relay mechanism in which a redox protein transfers electrons to these loop residues, which in turn reduce the membrane-embedded Cys132-Cys135 disulfide bond to activate VKOR. The results have implications for the mechanism of warfarin resistance, the topology of VKOR in the membrane, and the interaction of VKOR with the carboxylase."
https://openalex.org/W2052568221,"Prostaglandin (PG) E2, a potent mediator produced in inflamed tissues, can substantially influence mast cell responses including adhesion to basement membrane proteins, chemotaxis, and chemokine production. However, the signaling pathways by which PGE2 induces mast cell chemotaxis and chemokine production remains undefined. In this study, we identified the downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), as a key regulator of these responses. In mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells, PGE2 was found to induce activation of mTORC1 (mTOR complexed to raptor) as indicated by increased p70S6K and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, and activation of mTORC2 (mTOR complexed to rictor), as indicated by increased phosphorylation of AKT at position Ser473. Selective inhibition of the mTORC1 cascade by rapamycin or by the use of raptor-targeted shRNA failed to decrease PGE2-mediated chemotaxis or chemokine generation. However, inhibition of the mTORC2 cascade through the dual mTORC1/mTORC2 inhibitor Torin, or through rictor-targeted shRNA, resulted in a significant attenuation in PGE2-mediated chemotaxis, which was associated with a comparable decrease in actin polymerization. Furthermore, mTORC2 down-regulation decreased PGE2-induced production of the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2), which was linked to a significant reduction in ROS production. These findings are consistent with the conclusion that activation of mTORC2, downstream of PI3K, represents a critical signaling locus for chemotaxis and chemokine release from PGE2-activated mast cells.

Elucidating the function of these effectors is essential for our understanding of pathogenesis. Here, we describe biochemical and structural characterization of an effector protein (NleL) from Escherichia coli O157:H7, a widespread pathogen causing severe foodborne diseases. We show that NleL functionally and structurally mimics eukaryotic HECT E3 ligases and catalyzes formation of unanchored polyubiquitin chains using Lys6 and Lys48 linkage. The catalytic cysteine residue forms a thioester intermediate with ubiquitin. The structure of NleL contains two domains, a β-helix domain formed by pentapeptide repeats and a bilobed catalytic domain reminiscent of the N- and C-lobe architecture of HECT E3s. Six structures of NleL observed in two crystal forms revealed a large range of different positions of the C-lobe relative to the N-lobe, indicating that the helix linking the two lobes is extremely flexible. Comparing the structure of NleL with that of the Salmonella homolog SopA showed that the orientation of the C-lobes differ by as much as 108°, suggesting that large movements of the C-lobe may be required to facilitate the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to the substrate. These results provide critical knowledge toward understanding the molecular mechanism by which pathogens utilize the host ubiquitination system during infection.

IntroductionIn eukaryotes, ubiquitination plays important roles in many cellular functions, including protein degradation, DNA repair, cell-cycle progression, trafficking, and endocytosis (1Kerscher O. Felberbaum R. Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 159-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). The event of ubiquitination involves a multienzyme cascade consisting of classes of enzymes known as ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1), conjugating enzymes (E2), and ligases (E3). The E1 enzyme activates a free ubiquitin (Ub) 2The abbreviations used are: UbubiquitinpolyUbpolyubiquitinMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidNELnovel E3 ligase. by forming a thioester bond between its active site cysteine and the carboxyl terminus of Ub using the energy from ATP hydrolysis; the activated Ub is then passed to the active cysteine on the E2 conjugating enzyme; finally, E3 mediates the transfer of the Ub from E2 to the substrate (2Freemont P.S.

U.S.A. 1995; 92: 5249Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The E3 ligases are particularly important in conferring substrate specificity by interacting directly with the target proteins. There are two major E3 families: the RING (really interesting new gene) finger (2Freemont P.S. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 684: 174-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) and the HECT (homologous to E6AP carboxyl terminus) (3Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

RING and HECT E3s function through very different mechanisms. RING E3s catalyze ubiquitination by serving as a molecular scaffold to bring the Ub-charged E2 and the substrate into close proximity, whereas HECT E3s directly participate in the chemistry by forming a thioester bond with the Ub molecule brought by E2 and then direct it to the substrate protein. Crystal structures of the catalytic domain of HECT E3s (5Verdecia M.A. Joazeiro C.A. Wells N.J. Ferrer J.L. Bowman M.E. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Mol.

Cell Microbiol. 2006; 8: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Recently, we also reported that SopA from Salmonella is an E3 ligase structurally similar to eukaryotic HECT E3s (22Zhang Y. Higashide W.M. McCormick B.A. Chen J. Zhou D. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 62: 786-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 23Diao J. Zhang Y. Huibregtse J.M. Zhou D. Chen J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).In this study, we biochemically and structurally characterized NleL (non-Lee-encoded effector ligase), a homologue of SopA from Escherichia coli O157:H7. Previously, it was shown that NleL (named EspX7) was an effector protein translocated into host cell via the type III secretion system (24Tobe T. Beatson S.A. Taniguchi H. Abe H. Bailey C.M. Fivian A. Younis R. Matthews S. Marches O. Frankel G. Hayashi T. Pallen M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 14941-14946Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 25Deng W. de Hoog C.L.

But little has been known about the function of NleL in host cells. Here, we show that NleL catalyzes formation of unanchored polyubiquitin chain using Lys6 and Lys48 linkage. Similar to SopA, the structure of NleL contains a β-helix domain and a catalytic domain with a bilobed fold. The relative orientations between the two lobes revealed in the structures of NleL and SopA are markedly different, suggesting that like eukaryotic HECT E3s, the flexibility of the C-lobe is essential in Ub transfer.DISCUSSIONHere, we report the biochemical and structural characterization of NleL, a previously uncharacterized T3SS effector protein from enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7. Similar to SopA, NleL contains a protease-sensitive N terminus, a β-helix domain, and a C-terminal catalytic domain that resembles the bilobed architecture of eukaryotic HECT E3s. Whereas the N-lobe of NleL is of similar shape and size to that of E6AP, the C-lobes of NleL and E6AP are different in size and fold (8Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 23Diao J. Zhang Y. Huibregtse J.M. Zhou D. Chen J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Unlike eukaryotic HECT, the N- and C- lobes of NleL are connected by a helix; however, the conformational flexibility of the helix functionally mimics that of the unstructured loop in E6AP. Formation of a thioester intermediate is characteristic of HECT E3s. The ubiquitin ligase activity of NleL is dependent upon a cysteine residue (Cys753) that forms an intermediate with Ub through a thioester bond. In vitro ubiquitination assay shows that NleL preferably forms unanchored polyUb chains using Lys6 and Lys48 linkages.Ubiquitination is absent in bacteria; therefore, it is likely that NleL is synthesized by pathogenic bacteria to function exclusively in eukaryotic hosts. Very often, prokaryotes incorporate eukaryotic genes directly into their genome by a mechanism called horizontal gene transfer (13Spallek T. Robatzek S. Göhre V. Cell Microbiol. 2009; 11: 1425-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, because NleL shows no sequence homology to any eukaryotic proteins, it seems likely that NleL is acquired through convergent evolution. A BLAST search against all sequenced genomes found homologs of NleL in Citrobacter rodentium ICC168, E. coli E22, and more than a dozen Salmonella strains. A common feature of these bacteria is that they all cause disease in humans and warm-blooded animals. Comparative genomic analysis suggested that Salmonella and E. coli diverged ∼100 million years ago (43Porwollik S. McClelland M. Microbes. Infect. 2003; 5: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and pathogenic E. coli such as enterohemorrhagic E. coli separated from nonpathogenic strains around 4.5 million years ago (44Reid S.D. Herbelin C.J. Bumbaugh A.C. Selander R.K. Whittam T.S. Nature. 2000; 406: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Although one cannot exclude the possibility that Salmonella and enterohemorrhagic E. coli obtained the genes of SopA and NleL independently, it is more likely that Salmonella acquired the HECT-like protein (SopA) during co-evolution with the eukaryotic hosts. Then, this gene was introduced into other pathogenic bacteria such as enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, and C. rodentium through lateral gene transfer, a common mechanism for the distribution of genes in the microbial community (13Spallek T. Robatzek S. Göhre V. Cell Microbiol. 2009; 11: 1425-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).In addition to RING or HECT-like E3s, a family of bacterial effector proteins has been recently discovered to have ubiquitin ligase activity without any sequence or structural similarity to any eukaryotic ligases (10Hicks S.W. Galán J.E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2010; 13: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 16Singer A.U. Rohde J.R. Lam R. Skarina T. Kagan O. Dileo R. Chirgadze N.Y. Cuff M.E. Joachimiak A.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4864-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This group of proteins, termed NEL for Novel E3 ligases, contains two structural domains: an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat, which presumably interacts with substrates, and a C-terminal α-helical domain, which accounts for the catalytic activity. A conserved cysteine residue in the catalytic domain also forms a thioester bond with Ub (16Singer A.U. Rohde J.R. Lam R. Skarina T. Kagan O. Dileo R. Chirgadze N.Y. Cuff M.E. Joachimiak A. Tyers M. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. Savchenko A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1293-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 17Zhu Y. Li H. Hu L. Wang J. Zhou Y. Pang Z. Liu L. Shao F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1302-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar); thus, NEL is related to HECT E3s in terms of the chemistry of transthiolation. Structurally, NEL is very different from that of HECT E3 ligases. In contrast to NleL and SopA, where the relative orientation of the β-helical domain and the N-lobe is fixed, two structures of NELs showed marked difference in the relative position of the leucine-rich repeat domains (Fig. 7) (10Hicks S.W. Galán J.E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2010; 13: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 17Zhu Y. Li H. Hu L. Wang J. Zhou Y. Pang Z. Liu L. Shao F. Nat. Struct. Mol.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4864-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although flexibility is also observed within the catalytic domain of NEL, the extent of its motion is much less than in NleL or SopA (16Singer A.U. Rohde J.R. Lam R. Skarina T. Kagan O. Dileo R. Chirgadze N.Y. Cuff M.E. Joachimiak A. Tyers M. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. Savchenko A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1293-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 17Zhu Y. Li H. Hu L. Wang J. Zhou Y. Pang Z. Liu L. Shao F. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1302-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).The recent discovery of bacterial effector proteins functioning as ubiquitin ligases opens a new field. Although more than a half dozen of these ligases have been characterized structurally and biochemically, many questions remain unanswered. For example, how did the microbes initially acquire these proteins to function in eukaryotic hosts? Do eukaryotic counterparts of NEL exist? What is the function of these ligases in the life cycle of the bacteria? Investigations into these questions will provide a better understanding of bacterial pathogenesis, evolutionary biology, and the molecular mechanisms of ubiquitination. IntroductionIn eukaryotes, ubiquitination plays important roles in many cellular functions, including protein degradation, DNA repair, cell-cycle progression, trafficking, and endocytosis (1Kerscher O.

The E1 enzyme activates a free ubiquitin (Ub) 2The abbreviations used are: UbubiquitinpolyUbpolyubiquitinMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidNELnovel E3 ligase. by forming a thioester bond between its active site cysteine and the carboxyl terminus of Ub using the energy from ATP hydrolysis; the activated Ub is then passed to the active cysteine on the E2 conjugating enzyme; finally, E3 mediates the transfer of the Ub from E2 to the substrate (2Freemont P.S.

There are two major E3 families: the RING (really interesting new gene) finger (2Freemont P.S. Ann. N.Y. Acad.

RING and HECT E3s function through very different mechanisms.

The E1 enzyme activates a free ubiquitin (Ub) 2The abbreviations used are: UbubiquitinpolyUbpolyubiquitinMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidNELnovel E3 ligase. by forming a thioester bond between its active site cysteine and the carboxyl terminus of Ub using the energy from ATP hydrolysis; the activated Ub is then passed to the active cysteine on the E2 conjugating enzyme; finally, E3 mediates the transfer of the Ub from E2 to the substrate (2Freemont P.S.

There are two major E3 families: the RING (really interesting new gene) finger (2Freemont P.S. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 684: 174-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) and the HECT (homologous to E6AP carboxyl terminus) (3Huibregtse J.M. Scheffner M. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

RING and HECT E3s function through very different mechanisms. RING E3s catalyze ubiquitination by serving as a molecular scaffold to bring the Ub-charged E2 and the substrate into close proximity, whereas HECT E3s directly participate in the chemistry by forming a thioester bond with the Ub molecule brought by E2 and then direct it to the substrate protein.

Recently, we also reported that SopA from Salmonella is an E3 ligase structurally similar to eukaryotic HECT E3s (22Zhang Y. Higashide W.M. McCormick B.A. Chen J. Zhou D. Mol.

In this study, we biochemically and structurally characterized NleL (non-Lee-encoded effector ligase), a homologue of SopA from Escherichia coli O157:H7. Previously, it was shown that NleL (named EspX7) was an effector protein translocated into host cell via the type III secretion system (24Tobe T. Beatson S.A. Taniguchi H. Abe H. Bailey C.M.

But little has been known about the function of NleL in host cells. Here, we show that NleL catalyzes formation of unanchored polyubiquitin chain using Lys6 and Lys48 linkage. Similar to SopA, the structure of NleL contains a β-helix domain and a catalytic domain with a bilobed fold. The relative orientations between the two lobes revealed in the structures of NleL and SopA are markedly different, suggesting that like eukaryotic HECT E3s, the flexibility of the C-lobe is essential in Ub transfer. DISCUSSIONHere, we report the biochemical and structural characterization of NleL, a previously uncharacterized T3SS effector protein from enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7. Similar to SopA, NleL contains a protease-sensitive N terminus, a β-helix domain, and a C-terminal catalytic domain that resembles the bilobed architecture of eukaryotic HECT E3s. Whereas the N-lobe of NleL is of similar shape and size to that of E6AP, the C-lobes of NleL and E6AP are different in size and fold (8Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 23Diao J. Zhang Y. Huibregtse J.M. Zhou D. Chen J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Unlike eukaryotic HECT, the N- and C- lobes of NleL are connected by a helix; however, the conformational flexibility of the helix functionally mimics that of the unstructured loop in E6AP. Formation of a thioester intermediate is characteristic of HECT E3s. The ubiquitin ligase activity of NleL is dependent upon a cysteine residue (Cys753) that forms an intermediate with Ub through a thioester bond. In vitro ubiquitination assay shows that NleL preferably forms unanchored polyUb chains using Lys6 and Lys48 linkages.Ubiquitination is absent in bacteria; therefore, it is likely that NleL is synthesized by pathogenic bacteria to function exclusively in eukaryotic hosts. Very often, prokaryotes incorporate eukaryotic genes directly into their genome by a mechanism called horizontal gene transfer (13Spallek T. Robatzek S. Göhre V. Cell Microbiol. 2009; 11: 1425-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, because NleL shows no sequence homology to any eukaryotic proteins, it seems likely that NleL is acquired through convergent evolution. A BLAST search against all sequenced genomes found homologs of NleL in Citrobacter rodentium ICC168, E. coli E22, and more than a dozen Salmonella strains. A common feature of these bacteria is that they all cause disease in humans and warm-blooded animals. Comparative genomic analysis suggested that Salmonella and E. coli diverged ∼100 million years ago (43Porwollik S. McClelland M. Microbes. Infect. 2003; 5: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and pathogenic E. coli such as enterohemorrhagic E. coli separated from nonpathogenic strains around 4.5 million years ago (44Reid S.D. Herbelin C.J. Bumbaugh A.C. Selander R.K. Whittam T.S. Nature. 2000; 406: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Although one cannot exclude the possibility that Salmonella and enterohemorrhagic E. coli obtained the genes of SopA and NleL independently, it is more likely that Salmonella acquired the HECT-like protein (SopA) during co-evolution with the eukaryotic hosts. Then, this gene was introduced into other pathogenic bacteria such as enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, and C. rodentium through lateral gene transfer, a common mechanism for the distribution of genes in the microbial community (13Spallek T. Robatzek S. Göhre V. Cell Microbiol. 2009; 11: 1425-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).In addition to RING or HECT-like E3s, a family of bacterial effector proteins has been recently discovered to have ubiquitin ligase activity without any sequence or structural similarity to any eukaryotic ligases (10Hicks S.W.

This group of proteins, termed NEL for Novel E3 ligases, contains two structural domains: an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat, which presumably interacts with substrates, and a C-terminal α-helical domain, which accounts for the catalytic activity. A conserved cysteine residue in the catalytic domain also forms a thioester bond with Ub (16Singer A.U. Rohde J.R. Lam R. Skarina T. Kagan O. Dileo R. Chirgadze N.Y. Cuff M.E. Joachimiak A. Tyers M.

Structurally, NEL is very different from that of HECT E3 ligases. In contrast to NleL and SopA, where the relative orientation of the β-helical domain and the N-lobe is fixed, two structures of NELs showed marked difference in the relative position of the leucine-rich repeat domains (Fig. 7) (10Hicks S.W.

Although more than a half dozen of these ligases have been characterized structurally and biochemically, many questions remain unanswered. For example, how did the microbes initially acquire these proteins to function in eukaryotic hosts? Do eukaryotic counterparts of NEL exist?

About 50% of human tumors have TP53 gene mutations; most are missense ones that presumably lower the tumor suppressor activity of p53. In this study, we explored the effects of known tumor-derived missense mutations on the stability and oligomeric structure of p53; our comprehensive, quantitative analyses encompassed the tetramerization domain peptides representing 49 such substitutions in humans. Their effects on tetrameric structure were broad, and the stability of the mutant peptides varied widely (ΔTm = 4.8 ∼ −46.8 °C). Because formation of a tetrameric structure is critical for protein-protein interactions, DNA binding, and the post-translational modification of p53, a small destabilization of the tetrameric structure could result in dysfunction of tumor suppressor activity. We suggest that the threshold for loss of tumor suppressor activity in terms of the disruption of the tetrameric structure of p53 could be extremely low.

Procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are used in developed countries to differentiate between viral and bacterial causes of pneumonia. Validity of these markers needs to be further explored in Africa.We assessed the utility of PCT and CRP to differentiate viral from invasive bacterial pneumonia in children <5 years hospitalized with clinical severe pneumonia (CSP) in rural Mozambique, a malaria-endemic area with high HIV prevalence. Prognostic capacity of these markers was also evaluated. Out of 835 children with CSP, 87 fulfilled definition of viral pneumonia and 89 of invasive bacterial pneumonia. In absence of malaria parasites, levels of PCT and CRP were lower in the viral group when compared to the invasive bacterial one (PCT: median = 0.21 versus 8.31 ng/ml, p<0.001; CRP: 18.3 vs. 185.35 mg/l, p<0.001). However, in presence of malaria parasites distribution between clinical groups overlapped (PCT: median = 23.1 vs. 21.75 ng/ml, p = 0.825; CRP: median = 96.8 vs. 217.4 mg/l, p = 0.052).

https://openalex.org/W1998458467,"Pancreas secretes fluid rich in digestive enzymes and bicarbonate. The alkaline secretion is important in buffering of acid chyme entering duodenum and for activation of enzymes. This secretion is formed in pancreatic ducts, and studies to date show that plasma membranes of duct epithelium express H+/HCO3− transporters, which depend on gradients created by the Na+/K+-ATPase. However, the model cannot fully account for high-bicarbonate concentrations, and other active transporters, i.e. pumps, have not been explored. Here we show that pancreatic ducts express functional gastric and non-gastric H+-K+-ATPases. We measured intracellular pH and secretion in small ducts isolated from rat pancreas and showed their sensitivity to H+-K+ pump inhibitors and ion substitutions. Gastric and non-gastric H+-K+ pumps were demonstrated on RNA and protein levels, and pumps were localized to the plasma membranes of pancreatic ducts. Quantitative analysis of H+/HCO3− and fluid transport shows that the H+-K+ pumps can contribute to pancreatic secretion in several species. Our results call for revision of the bicarbonate transport physiology in pancreas, and most likely other epithelia. Furthermore, because pancreatic ducts play a central role in several pancreatic diseases, it is of high relevance to understand the role of H+-K+ pumps in pathophysiology. Pancreas secretes fluid rich in digestive enzymes and bicarbonate. The alkaline secretion is important in buffering of acid chyme entering duodenum and for activation of enzymes. This secretion is formed in pancreatic ducts, and studies to date show that plasma membranes of duct epithelium express H+/HCO3− transporters, which depend on gradients created by the Na+/K+-ATPase. However, the model cannot fully account for high-bicarbonate concentrations, and other active transporters, i.e. pumps, have not been explored. Here we show that pancreatic ducts express functional gastric and non-gastric H+-K+-ATPases.

Furthermore, because pancreatic ducts play a central role in several pancreatic diseases, it is of high relevance to understand the role of H+-K+ pumps in pathophysiology. Transport of acids and bases over cell membranes is essential for the function of every cell in the body. Some organs maintain body acid/base homeostasis, while others utilize acid/base transport for special purposes, such as digestion, and transport significant quantities of H+ and HCO3−. Pancreatic ducts secrete a HCO3−-rich fluid (40–150 mm) that conveys an enzyme-rich fluid produced by pancreatic acini. How is such secretion formed? Most simply, one can envisage that transepithelial HCO3− secretion can occur by moving HCO3− from serosa to lumen and/or by H+ transport in the opposite direction. From first electrophysiological and intracellular pH studies on isolated rat pancreatic ducts, the working cellular model for bicarbonate transport was proposed and later extended to account for HCO3− transport in pancreas of other species, and also in other HCO3−-transporting epithelia (1Novak I. Greger R. Pflügers Arch. 1988; 411: 546-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 2Gray M.A. Greenwell J.R. Argent B.E. J. Membr.

Basically, on the basolateral membrane the model includes transporters that would lead to accumulation of cellular HCO3−, a Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) 4The abbreviations used are: NHENa+/H+ exchangerAECl−/HCO3− anion exchangerCFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorHKH+-K+ pumpNBCNa+-HCO3− cotransporterROIregion of interest. and a Na+-HCO3− cotransporter (NBC) that belongs to the SLC4 bicarbonate transporter gene family. On the luminal membrane HCO3− efflux would occur via Cl−/HCO3− anion exchanger (AE) belonging to the sulfate permease family, e.g. SLC26A6 (3Steward M.C. Ishiguro H. Case R.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 377-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Following hormonal or neural stimulation, the whole process would be initiated by opening of luminal Cl− channels: the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl− channels, which may have some HCO3− permeability; or the Ca2+-activated Cl− channels. The membrane potential and driving force on anion secretion would be provided by K+ channels (4Novak I. Greger R. Pflügers Arch. 1988; 411: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The main feature of this model is that H+/HCO3− transport is secondary active and relies on ion gradients created by the primary active transporter, the Na+/K+-ATPase. Nevertheless, given the ion selectivity, electrochemical gradients and unusual regulation of CFTR and Cl−/HCO3− exchange by extracellular HCO3− and Cl−, it is unclear how pancreatic ducts can secrete more than 80–100 mmol/liter HCO3− to the lumen (3Steward M.C. Ishiguro H. Case R.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 377-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Several earlier studies on pancreatic ducts searched for a primary active transporter, the vacuolar H+ pump, but evidence at the molecular level is missing and functional data on this issue are contradictory (5de Ondarza J. Hootman S.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G124-G134PubMed Google Scholar, 6Villanger O. Veel T. Raeder M.G.

Na+/H+ exchanger Cl−/HCO3− anion exchanger cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator H+-K+ pump Na+-HCO3− cotransporter region of interest. In the present study we addressed the question of whether pancreatic ducts possess another functional H+ pump, namely an H+-K+-ATPase, which could participate in H+/HCO3− transport. The H+-K+-ATPases belong to the large family of P-type ATPases, and each pump is made up of two catalytic α-subunits and two regulatory β-subunits. The α-subunits of H+-K+-ATPase are classified into two groups, gastric and non-gastric (latter also called colonic), coded by the ATP4A gene and ATP12A gene (latter denoted also ATP1AL1). There is 60–65% homology between the α-subunits of these pumps and the closest relative, the Na+/K+-ATPase. The gastric α-subunit (HKα1) assembles with the gastric β-subunit (HKβ); the non-gastric α-subunit (HKα2) can also assemble with the gastric β-subunit, although it can also borrow the β1-subunit of the Na+/K+-ATPase or assemble with different β-subunits and other associating proteins (8Codina J.

The gastric pump is able to create large H+ (and HCO3−) gradients and it has a clear physiological function in HCl secretion by parietal cells of the stomach. In kidney distal nephrons and cochlea, the pump may be responsible for constitutive H+ secretion and K+ absorption, and K+ recirculation, respectively (14Silver R.B. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F799-F811PubMed Google Scholar, 15Shibata T. Hibino H. Doi K. Suzuki T. Hisa Y. Kurachi Y. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2006; 291: C1038-C1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Many other epithelial tissues, such as colon, kidney, skin, placenta, and prostate, express non-gastric H+-K+ pumps. These can contribute to H+ secretion and K+ absorption, but this is usually associated with conditions of disturbed acid-base or K+ and Na+ homeostasis rather than the “normal” physiological situation (9Jaisser F.

Control bathing solutions containing bicarbonate had the following composition (in mmol/liter): Na+ 145, Cl− 125, HCO3− 25, K+ 4, Ca2+ 1.5, Mg2+ 1, phosphate 2, glucose 5; they were equilibrated with 5% CO2 in O2; pH was 7.4. In HCO3−-free solutions NaHCO3 was replaced with NaCl or sodium gluconate and 10 mm HEPES was used as a buffer. For ammonium pulses 20 mmol/liter Na+ was replaced with NH4+. In Na+ and K+-free solutions, N-methyl-d-glucamide was used for replacement. The following inhibitors were used: 4′-4′-diisothiocyanate-dihydro-stilbebe-2,2′-disulfonacid (H2DIDS, 0.5 mm), omeprazole (10 μm), and SCH-28080 (100 μm); and prepared according to the instructions (Sigma, Denmark). The primary antibodies were: Calbiochem 119100 (HK12.18, anti HKα1 monoclonal); Calbiochem 119101 (anti HKα1 polyclonal, against C-terminal), Chemicon AB 1679 (anti HKα1 polyclonal, against N-terminal), or Sigma A-274 (2G11, anti HKβ, monoclonal). Rat non-gastric HKα2 antibody (C384-M79) raised against (Glu528–Met555) (17Swarts H.G. Koenderink J.B. Willems P.H. De Pont J.J. J. Biol.

Secondary antibodies were conjugated to Alexa dyes or Cy3) (Invitrogen, Jackson ImmunoResearch). Protocols involving handling of animals were approved by the Danish Animal Experiment Inspectorate (Dyreforsøgstilsynet). Wistar rats were killed by cervical dislocation and pancreas was removed. Subsequently, collagenase digestion and dissection was carried out according to previously published method (18Hede S.E. Amstrup J. Christoffersen B.C. Novak I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31784-31791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In a dissection microscope ducts were identified from their appearance and relation to other structures, similar to a morphological study (19Githens 3rd, S. Holmquist D.R. Whelan J.F. Ruby J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 122-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). After transfer to a higher resolution microscope, ducts were measured and epithelium type confirmed. For this study we used small ducts, some of the intercalated type (closest to acini) and mostly small intralobular duct fragments (Fig. 1A). Larger ducts between pancreatic lobules, interlobular ducts, were not used. Fig. 1B shows the size distribution (outer diameter) of the ducts used in this study; their length was 200–500 μm. Ducts were placed in an experimental chamber on an inverted microscope and used for pHi measurements or for secretion studies. Small duct fragments were held by holding pipettes, but could not be perfused, although we can perfuse larger microdissected ducts (20Novak I. Greger R. Pflügers Arch. 1991; 419: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Detailed methods for pHi measurement in pancreatic ducts are described elsewhere (21Novak I. Christoffersen B.C. Pflügers Arch. 2001; 441: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, pancreatic ducts were loaded with BCECF/AM (2 μm), for 20–30 min; thereafter they were kept at 37 °C in perfused experimental chamber. Both the luminal and the basolateral sides were accessible to the bathing solution. Intracellular pH (pHi) was estimated from changes in the fluorescence emission (at 510 nm) from 15–20 cells after excitation at 488 and 436 nm. Signals were calibrated in situ with 10 μm nigericin in high K+ buffers, and the fluorescence ratios and pHi were fitted to a calibration curve. A standard method of ammonium pre-pulse was used to study H+/HCO3− transport. Tissues were exposed to ammonium pulses (2–3 min), then ammonium was removed, and pHi recovery rates from acidosis were determined from the initial slopes of pHi changes and expressed as dpH/dt (i.e. pH units/minute). Also dpH/dt was converted to the transmembrane H+ flux, J(H)+ (in mmol·liter·cell water−1·min−1), taking into account appropriate buffering capacities at given pHi, as we described earlier (21Novak I. Christoffersen B.C. Pflügers Arch. 2001; 441: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Pancreatic ducts were placed in chambers containing bicarbonate buffer gassed with humidified 5% CO2 in O2 and temperature was 37 °C. Ducts were held by one holding, occluding pipette. Dextran Texas Red 10,000 MW (25 μg/ml) was added, and ducts were allowed to rest about 30 min. The fluorophore was excited at 568 nm, and emission was monitored at 600–650 nm every 20 s in Leica TCS NT/SP CLSM microscope. First, images were collected from non-stimulated duct. Subsequently, ducts were exposed to secretin ± inhibitors (Omeprazole and SCH-28080) for 10–20 min. After a wash and rest of ∼20 min, the same ducts were subjected to the second stimulation protocol. A region of interest, ROI (50–200 μm), was drawn on a part of the duct that was not moving or did not appear leaky. Image analysis was performed in MetaMorph 5 using integrated morphometry analysis. Images were first converted to monochrome, equalized, aligned, thresholded, and converted to binary images. Area within ROI in the lumen was calculated and used for the volume (V) estimation, assuming that the duct segment was a cylinder. The volume was calculated for each frame and for comparison between different ducts it was expressed in relation to the first frame as Vrel. The area of the duct epithelium (E) facing the lumen was estimated, assuming that the duct lumen increased in radius, length was delimited by ROI. Finally, the secretory rate (Jv) per epithelium area was calculated from the following equation using the initial area for the calculation: Jv = (dVrel/dt)/E. RNA from whole pancreatic tissue, pancreatic ducts, colon, and stomach was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and method was optimized similar to published protocols (22Li D. Ren W. Wang X. Wang F. Gao Y. Ning Q. Han Y. Song T. Lu S. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 2009; 158: 253-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The RT-PCR reactions were done with OneStep reaction kit (Qiagen) using designed primers (Table 1). RNA was also extracted from single intercalated/intralobular pancreatic ducts pooled in lots of 3 per vial and checked for contamination using specific primers for thrombin and amylase according to the previously published method (18Hede S.E. Amstrup J. Christoffersen B.C. Novak I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31784-31791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Only non-contaminated RNA was used for further analysis. Because this RNA was limited, an additional PCR reaction was performed on RT-PCR products with specific nested PCR primers (Table 1). Primers were designed using VectorNTI software (Invitrogen) and identity of all products was confirmed by sequencing (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany).TABLE 1Primers used for rat RT-PCR and nested PCRPrimer setsSizeRat tissue RT-PCR primersrHKstomach forward: 5′-ACC CTC CCC GGG CCA CCG T-3′476 bprHKstomach reverse: 5′-CAG CAA GAT CAT GTC AGC AGC A-3′rHKcolon forward: 5′-TCC ATG ATC GAC CCT CCT CGG T-3′485 bprHKcolon reverse: 5′-TAG TAA GAC CAT GTC AGC TGC G-3′rHKβ forward: 5′-CTT CGA CAA CCC CCA CGA CCC-3′372 bprHKβ reverse: 5′-AGG ACA GAC AAA TGG TCA CAG-3′Rat tissue nested PCR primersrHKstomachnest forward: 5′-CGT TCC AGA TGC TGT GCT CAA-3′350 bprHKstomachnest reverse: 5′-TTA CAG CCA CAA TGG CAC CC-3′rHKcolonnest forward: 5′-GTG CCA GAC GCA GTC TCC AAA T-3′307 bprHKcolonnest reverse: 5′-TGA TCA ACT TCT GCT GGG GTG A-3′rHKβnest forward: 5′-CCC TAT GAA GGG AAG GTG GAG T-3′276 bprHKβnest reverse: 5′-GTG TTA ACC GCA CGG GAT TG-3′ Open table in a new tab For protein isolation, pancreas, and other organs were excised, cut into small pieces, and washed with ice-cold PBS. Tissues were homogenized in 3∼5 ml homogenization buffer with SigmaFAST protease inhibitor and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged at 190,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The resulting pellet was washed with 250 mm KBr and re-centrifuged to pellet membranes, which were then washed in 100 mm Na2CO3 at pH 11 and then centrifuged for a final time. The microsomes were dissolved in lysis buffer. All solutions contained 1× Sigma protease inhibitor (S-8820). Protein digestion due to endogenous pancreatic proteases is a common problem. To reduce the amount of digestive enzymes, we optimized the method as follows. Pancreas pieces were homogenized in ice-cold SME buffer (250 mm sucrose, 25 mm MES, 2 mm EGTA, pH 6). Our new method includes a double centrifugation, which was established to remove the fraction containing zymogen granules (23Haanes K.A. Novak I. Biochem. J. 2010; 429: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The first pellet after the 250 × g centrifugation and the second supernatant after the 1,400 × g centrifugation were mixed and re-homogenized. Then the similar procedure for preparing the microsomes was followed as given above. Protein samples were loaded on 10% or 4∼12% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), separated by electrophoresis, and blotted to PVDF membranes (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C or 1 h at room temperature and incubated for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies recognizing the gastric HKα1 (Calbiochem 119101, 1:1,000), gastric HKβ (Sigma A274, 1:4,000), or non-gastric HKα2 (1:1,000). Blots were incubated with appropriate HRP-conjugated antibodies (DAKO, diluted 1:2,500), developed with ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized by exposure on films (General Electrics). Paraffin or cryosections from pancreas, colon, and stomach were prepared from control rats, and in some cases rats were previously stimulated with secretin as published (24Sørensen C.E. Amstrup J. Rasmussen H.N. Ankorina-Stark I. Novak I. J. Physiol. 2003; 551: 881-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Tissues were fixed in methanol at −20 °C for 5 min, or in 4% paraformaldehyde PBS for 15 min, and the latter were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% BSA in PBS for 10–12 min. Samples were blocked for 30 min in 3% BSA in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies against various HK subunits (see above) in dilutions 1:300 to 1:100. Secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa dyes or Cy3 (1:400) (Invitrogen, Jackson ImmunoResearch) were added for 45 min. In control samples done with every run, primary or secondary antibodies were omitted. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (300–400 nm) for 5 min. Samples were mounted with 2% n-propylgallat and 90% glycerol. Fluorescence was examined in a Leica TCS NT/SP CLSM with 40 × 1.2 NA or 100 × 1.4 NA oil objectives. Images and overlays were analyzed in Leica software or in MetaMorph 5 and exported as TIFF files to CorelDraw for composite picture. Except for cropping, no image manipulation was used. Data are presented as original recordings and summaries showing the mean values ± S.E. Control and test measurements were made within the same ducts as far as possible, and n refers to measurements on different ducts. Student′s t test, paired, and in some cases unpaired, was applied. p < 0.05 was accepted as significant and denoted with asterisks. Data were analyzed in Origin (Microcal Software, Inc). To determine ion transporters regulating intracellular pH (pHi) and transmembrane H+/HCO3− transport, we isolated single ducts from rat pancreas and stimulated them with secretin. We used the smallest pancreatic ducts (intercalated and intralobular) (Fig. 1), which are rich in carbonic anhydrase, CFTR and aquaporins (25Hyde K. Reid C.J. Tebbutt S.J. Weide L. Hollingsworth M.A. Harris A. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 914-919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 26Kumpulainen T. Jalovaara P.

Gut. 2003; 52: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and considered the most likely site of HCO3− transport. A common protocol to study HCO3−/H+ transport is to monitor the recovery of pHi following an acid load. This is achieved by pre-pulse with an ammonium buffer (NH4+/NH3), then upon its removal pHi falls rapidly due to excess of intracellular H+ left after diffusion of NH3 out of cells (Fig. 2A). Cells then rapidly regulate pHi to control levels either by H+ export or HCO3− import, the latter if extracellular HCO3−/CO2 buffer is provided. This transport can be monitored as dpH/dt and this can be converted to the transmembrane flux of H+, or HCO3− (see “Experimental Procedures”). In a physiological HCO3−/CO2 buffer the flux of H+ or HCO3− was 44.36 ± 3.64 mm/min, and in the HCO3−/CO2-free buffer it was 16.74 ± 1.78 mm/min (n = 9,10) (Fig. 2). These experiments show that the pHi recovery was significantly higher in the presence of extracellular HCO3−/CO2 buffer, probably as several transporters contributed to the recovery (see below). In the following series of experiments on the secretin-stimulated ducts, we tested the effect of H+-K+ pump inhibitors (Fig. 3). In physiological buffers, omeprazole (the gastric H+-K+ pump inhibitor) had no significant effect on pHi recovery (Fig. 3A). Similarly, SCH-28080 that inhibits the gastric but also non-gastric H+-K+ pumps at high concentrations (11Grishin A.V. Bevensee M.O. Modyanov N.N. Rajendran V. Boron W.F. Caplan M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F539-F551PubMed Google Scholar, 17Swarts H.G. Koenderink J.B. Willems P.H. De Pont J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33115-33122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), also had no effect on pHi recovery (Fig. 3B). Nevertheless, in epithelial cells transporting H+ or HCO3− across the plasma membranes, one might expect that pHi would be regulated by several transport systems. We therefore inhibited Cl−/HCO3− exchange and Na+-HCO3− cotransport by H2DIDS (Fig. 3C). Omeprazole now reduced pHi recovery by 39% (n = 5), thus indicating functional H+-K+ pumps. Following this reasoning, we eliminated participation of Na+-dependent and HCO3−-dependent transporters, such as NHE, NBC, and AE, by simply removing extracellular Na+ and HCO3−/CO2 buffer (Fig. 4). The ability of stimulated ducts to recover from the experimental acid-load was reduced more than 4-fold in Na+-free solutions (Fig. 4B). Similar ranges of pHi values were taken into account for control and Na+-free experiments (Fig. 4C). Most importantly, there was a small but significant pHi recovery even in the absence of extracellular Na+. Therefore, we tested the effect of H+-K+ pump inhibitors under these conditions (Fig. 5). Now, both omeprazole and SCH-28080 inhibited 56 and 69% of Na+-independent pHi recovery (Fig. 5, A and B). To further verify the presence of the H+-K+-ATPase, we tested the dependence of pHi recovery on extracellular K+ and results are shown in Fig. 6A. This maneuver is often used for testing of the non-gastric type H+-K+-ATPase. In our hands a short-term removal of extracellular K+ eliminated pHi recovery, and the effect was fully reversible. Similarly, the pHi recovery was abolished with ouabain (Fig. 6B), which is known to block the non-gastric H+-K+ pump (11Grishin A.V. Bevensee M.O. Modyanov N.N. Rajendran V. Boron W.F. Caplan M.J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 33115-33122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). That is, addition of ouabain (3 mm) stopped the pHi recovery and this effect was fully reversible. Addition of ouabain or removal of K+ for short time periods is not likely to run-down cell ion gradients, which was demonstrated earlier by microelectrode recordings in duct cells (4Novak I. Greger R. Pflügers Arch. 1988; 411: 58-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Removal of extracellular Na+ (in −BIC solution) inhibits most but not all pHi recovery from acidosis. A, example of a pHi measurement in a duct challenged with a control ammonium pulse and later with an ammonium pulse where Na+ was removed during the first 5 min of the recovery period. When Na+ was added back to the bathing solution, the duct pHi recovered completely. B, comparison of pHi recovery from ammonium-induced acidosis during control conditions in -BIC (C) and in Na+-free conditions (0 Na+). Asterisk indicates p < 0.05. C, shows dpH/dt as a function of the pHi value from which the ducts started the pHi recovery after an ammonium pulse in controls and Na+-free conditions. In the Na+-free solutions the recovery rate appears to depend on the extent of acidosis. Although the extreme acidic pHi values may not be accurately estimated with the BCECF fluorophore, it is clear that in the range of pHi values, common for the two conditions (i.e. pHi 6.6–7.0), the pHi recovery was slower in the absence of Na+. All ducts were stimulated with secretin (1 nm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5Omeprazole and SCH-28080 inhibits Na+-independent pHi recovery.

These transporters can contribute to pHi regulation and/or net transepithelial H+/HCO3− transport. By “experimentally removing” some of the transporters, it was possible for the first time to demonstrate functional gastric and non-gastric H+-K+ pumps in pancreatic ducts. Now the task was to see whether pancreatic duct epithelium expressed such H+-K+ pumps and whether they could contribute to secretion. We examined expression of gastric and non-gastric pump α-subunits, and also β-subunit of the gastric pump. Methods were optimized for the labile pancreas preparations and we used colon, stomach and kidney as controls. RT-PCR analysis on whole rat pancreas shows that there are transcripts for α-subunit and β-subunit of the gastric H+-K+ pump, as well as α-subunit for the non-gastric pump (Fig. 7A). See Table 1 for primers. To pinpoint whether mRNA is indeed originating from pancreatic ducts, single ducts were collected and PCR was run with nested primers (Fig. 7B). Notably, the d"
https://openalex.org/W1995749795,"White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is the sole member of the novel Nimaviridae family, and the source of major economic problems in shrimp aquaculture. WSSV appears to have rapidly spread worldwide after the first reported outbreak in the early 1990s. Genomic deletions of various sizes occur at two loci in the WSSV genome, the ORF14/15 and ORF23/24 variable regions, and these have been used as molecular markers to study patterns of viral spread over space and time. We describe the dynamics underlying the process of WSSV genome shrinkage using empirical data and a simple mathematical model.We genotyped new WSSV isolates from five Asian countries, and analyzed this information together with published data. Genome size appears to stabilize over time, and deletion size in the ORF23/24 variable region was significantly related to the time of the first WSSV outbreak in a particular country. Parameter estimates derived from fitting a simple mathematical model of genome shrinkage to the data support a geometric progression (k<1) of the genomic deletions, with k = 0.371 ± 0.150.The data suggest that the rate of genome shrinkage decreases over time before attenuating. Bioassay data provided support for a link between genome size and WSSV fitness in an aquaculture setting. Differences in genomic deletions between geographic WSSV isolates suggest that WSSV spread did not follow a smooth pattern of geographic radiation, suggesting spread of WSSV over long distances by commercial activities. We discuss two hypotheses for genome shrinkage, an adaptive and a neutral one. We argue in favor of the adaptive hypothesis, given that there is support for a link between WSSV genome size and fitness."

We assessed rates of loss to follow-up for migrant workers compared with non-migrant workers in a routine treatment programme in Morjia, Lesotho.All adult patients (≥18 years) initiating ART between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2008, and followed up until the end of 2009, were included in the study. We described rates of loss to follow-up according to migrant status by Kaplan-Meier estimates, and used Poisson regression to model associations between migrant status and loss to follow-up controlling for potential confounders identified a priori.Our cohort comprised 1185 people, among whom 12% (148) were migrant workers. Among the migrant workers, median age was 36.1 (29.6-45.9) and the majority (55%) were male. We found no statistically significant differences between baseline characteristics and migrant status. Rates of lost to follow up were similar between migrants and non-migrants in the first 3 months but differences increased thereafter. Between 3 and 6 months after initiating antiretroviral therapy, migrants had a 2.78-fold increased rate of defaulting (95%CI 1.15-6.73); between 6 and 12 months the rate was 2.36 times greater (95%CI 1.18-4.73), whereas after 1 year the rate was 6.69 times greater (95%CI 3.18-14.09).Our study highlights the need for programme implementers to take into account the specific challenges that may influence continuity of antiretroviral treatment and care for migrant populations."

Here, we examine the molecular requirements necessary for heat-induced apoptosis using genetically modified Jurkat T-lymphocytes.

Sublethal heat exposure is known to induce an evolutionarily conserved adaptive response known as the heat shock response. A key feature of this response includes the transcriptional up-regulation of several heat shock proteins that are known to confer protection against a subsequent exposure to an otherwise lethal cellular stressor, including γ-radiation, hyperthermia, and chemotherapeutic agents (1Parsell D.A.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2907-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). By comparison, an initial exposure of cells to a more severe or prolonged bout of hyperthermia is known to overcome this protective heat shock response and induce apoptosis or necrosis (3Milleron R.S.

Significantly, because hyperthermia can induce apoptosis, it is currently being tested in combination with conventional anti-cancer therapy in clinical trials for advanced malignancies (4Kouloulias V.

Additionally, there is a growing interest in developing ways to more selectively target tumor cells with hyperthermia for therapeutic use (6Ito A. Honda H. Kobayashi T. Cancer Immunol.

There are two distinct apoptotic pathways: (i) the mitochondria-mediated (i.e. intrinsic) pathway and (ii) the receptor-mediated (i.e. extrinsic) pathway. The extrinsic pathway is activated upon binding of a death ligand to its cognate receptor (e.g. Fas binding to the Fas receptor), which causes the receptors to move within close proximity to one another and recruit the adaptor protein Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), followed by the recruitment of initiator procaspase-8 or -10 (8Boatright K.M.

This protein complex is termed the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) and serves as the activating platform for initiator caspase-8 and -10 during receptor-mediated apoptosis. In so-called type I cells, there is sufficient activation of caspase-8 at the DISC to directly cleave and activate effector caspase-3, resulting in execution of apoptosis. However, in so-called type II cells, activated caspase-8 does not directly cleave and activate a sufficient amount of effector caspase-3 to execute apoptosis. In this cell type, activated caspase-8 cleaves the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bid to truncated Bid (tBid), 2The abbreviations used are: tBidtruncated BidMOMPmitochondrial outer membrane permeabilizationApaf-1apoptotic protease activating factor-1Q-VD-OPhquinoline-Val-Asp-CH2-difluorophenoxyRAIDDreceptor-interacting protein (RIP)-associated ICH-1/CED-3 homologous protein with a death domainBH3Bcl-2 homology 3ΔΨmitochondrial membrane potentialb-VAD-fmkbiotin-Val-Ala-Asp(O-methyl)-CH2FZ-VADbenzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp. which then engages the mitochondria-mediated pathway (10Barnhart B.C.

Mitochondria-mediated apoptosis is activated following exposure to cytotoxic stressors, including DNA damage, growth factor withdrawal, and γ-radiation. During intrinsic apoptosis, caspase activation is largely regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins. The Bcl-2 family of proteins contains both pro- and anti-apoptotic members that function to either promote or inhibit mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). MOMP leads to the release of cytochrome c from the intermembrane space of mitochondria into the cytosol where it is required for caspase activation (11Jiang X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). Specifically, cytosolic cytochrome c interacts with the adaptor protein apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and dATP to form the apoptosome complex, which then recruits and activates initiator caspase-9 (11Jiang X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). Activated initiator caspase-9 cleaves and activates downstream effector caspases, which then cleave various target substrates, resulting in the biochemical and morphological characteristics associated with apoptotic cell death. Although adaptive cellular responses to elevated temperatures have been studied for decades, heat-induced apoptosis has been studied to a much lesser extent, and conflicting results have emerged from these studies (3Milleron R.S.

In this regard, the aim of the current study was to help determine the molecular requirements necessary for heat-induced apoptosis. Because several of the more recent studies have used Jurkat T-lymphocytes as a model system to investigate apoptosis induced by elevated temperatures, we also used a large panel of genetically modified Jurkat cells in which key steps in the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway were inhibited. In agreement with previous studies, our results indicated that heat-induced apoptosis relies heavily on the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway. Significantly, although caspase-2, -8, and -9 were affinity-labeled as activated initiator caspases, subsequent experiments revealed that only the activation of caspase-9 was strictly required for heat-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. In addition, Bid was observed to play a role in this form of apoptosis as a regulator of MOMP, although its cleavage to tBid occurred downstream of Apaf-1, suggesting that tBid likely plays an amplification role in this process. Wild-type (clones E6.1 and A3) and caspase-8-deficient (clone I 9.2) Jurkat T-lymphocytes were cultured in RPMI 1640 complete medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2% (w/v) glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. For transfected cells, 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) was substituted for penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were maintained in an exponential growth phase for all experiments. All cells were replated in fresh complete nonselective medium prior to apoptosis induction. Apoptosis was induced either by exposure to hyperthermia (44 °C) for 1 h followed by a 6-h incubation at 37 °C or by treatment with agonistic anti-Fas antibody (100 ng/ml) (clone CH-11, MBL International, Woburn, MA) for 6 h. The caspase inhibitor quinoline-Val-Asp-difluorophenoxymethylketone (Q-VD-OPh) (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) was used at a final concentration of 20 μm. Phosphatidylserine exposure on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane was detected using the annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) apoptosis detection kit II (BD Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 106 cells were pelleted following heat or anti-Fas treatment and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Next, cells were resuspended in 500 μl of binding buffer, and 100 μl of the suspension (2 × 105 cells) were mixed with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide and incubated at room temperature (22 °C) for 5–10 min in the dark. Prior to flow cytometric analysis, 400 μl of binding buffer were added to the cells. For ΔΨ determination, the MitoProbe DiIC1(5) kit (Invitrogen) was used. Briefly, cells (106) were pelleted following drug treatment, washed once in PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of warm PBS. Next, 5 μl of 10 μm DiIC1(5) were added to the cells and incubated in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 500 μl of PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Pelleted cells (5 × 106) were resuspended and lysed in 200 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete mini EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce), and equal amounts were mixed with Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to 12–15% SDS-PAGE at 195 V followed by electroblotting to nitrocellulose for 1 h at 115 V. Membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat milk in PBS at room temperature (22 °C) and subsequently probed overnight at 4 °C with primary antibody suspended in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Following overnight incubation, membranes were rinsed and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce). Following the secondary antibody incubation, membranes were rinsed, and bound antibodies were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (GE Healthcare). The primary antibodies used were anti-β-actin (clone AC-15, Sigma), anti-caspase-2 (clone 35, BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-caspase-3 (clone 8G10, Cell Signaling), anti-caspase-8 (clone 1C12, Cell Signaling), anti-caspase-9 (Cell Signaling), anti-cytochrome c (clone 7H8.2C12, BD Pharmingen), and anti-RAIDD (StressGen). Cells (5 × 105) were pelleted and washed once with ice-cold PBS. Cells were resuspended in 25 μl of PBS, added to a microtiter plate, and combined with DEVD-aminomethylcoumarin (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) dissolved in a standard reaction buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.25, 10% sucrose, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% CHAPS). Cleavage of DEVD-aminomethylcoumarin was monitored by aminomethylcoumarin production in a FLx800 multi-detection microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, Vermont) using 355 nm excitation and 460 nm emission wavelengths. Cells (2.5 × 106/ml) were incubated with 120 μm cell-permeable biotinylated form of the general caspase inhibitor VAD-fmk (b-VAD-fmk; Kamiya Biomedical Co., Seattle, Washington) for 3 h at 37 °C prior to heat (44 °C) exposure or anti-Fas treatment. Following b-VAD-fmk pretreatment, cells were diluted with RPMI 1640 complete growth medium to a density of 106/ml and either incubated with anti-Fas (100 ng/ml) for 6 h or exposed to 44 °C for 1 h followed by a 6-h incubation at 37 °C. Afterward, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete mini EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science). Lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and subsequently centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Resulting supernatants were collected and incubated with 130 μl of prewashed streptavidin-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) followed by gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C. Following overnight incubation, beads were washed four times with wash buffer (same as lysis buffer except that the concentration of Nonidet P-40 was 0.5%), and bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis. The vector-based pSUPER RNAi system (OligoEngine, Seattle, WA) was used to suppress gene expression. The gene-specific targeting insert for RAIDD (receptor-interacting protein (RIP)-associated Ich-1/CED homologous protein with death domain; RefSeq accession number NM_003805) specifies a 19-nucleotide sequence corresponding to nucleotides 957–975 (5′-GGCAGGTGTCTCATATGTA-3′) downstream of the transcription start site, which is separated by a 9-nucleotide noncomplementary spacer (TTCAAGAGA) from the reverse complement of the same 19-nucleotide sequence. The targeting sequences used to suppress APAF-1, BID, and CASP2 gene expression have been reported previously (18Franklin E.E. Robertson J.D. Biochem.

In each case, the sequence was ligated into the BglII and XhoI sites of the pSUPER.neo vector, which was subsequently transformed into TOP10-competent cells (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Several clones were obtained, and the correct insert was verified by sequence analysis. Wild-type Jurkat T-lymphocytes (107) were transfected with 20 μg of plasmid DNA (pSUPER-neo, pSUPER-Apaf-1, pSUPER-Bid, pSUPER-Caspase-2, pSUPER-RAIDD, pSFFV-neo, pSFFV-Bcl-2, and pSFFV-Bcl-xL,) by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser Xcell system (0.4-cm cuvette, 300 V, and 950 microfarads). Cells were allowed to recover in RPMI 1640 complete growth medium minus antibiotics for 48 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. Selection of transfected cells was performed in the presence of 1 mg/ml Geneticin for several weeks, at which time serial dilutions were performed to obtain single-cell clones of Apaf-1-silenced cells, Bid-silenced cells, caspase-2-silenced cells, RAIDD-silenced cells, or cells overexpressing full-length human Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. For detection of activated Bak by flow cytometry, cells (106) were washed in PBS and fixed in 400 μl of 0.25% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, subsequently washed two times with 1% fetal bovine serum in PBS, and incubated in 50 μl of staining buffer (1% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml digitonin in PBS) with a conformation-specific mouse monoclonal antibody against Bak (1:30, AM03, Calbiochem) for 30 min at room temperature (22 °C). Then, cells were washed and resuspended in 50 μl of staining buffer containing 0.25 μg of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled chicken anti-mouse for 30 min in the dark. Cells were washed again and analyzed by flow cytometry. Analysis and histogram overlays were performed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Following heat shock, cells (106) were washed in PBS, resuspended in 50 μl of buffer (140 mm mannitol, 46 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete mini EDTA-free), and permeabilized with 3 μg of digitonin (Sigma) on ice for 10 min. Plasma membrane permeabilization was monitored by trypan blue staining, and cell suspensions were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis. Previous studies have reported different mechanisms for the initiation of heat-induced apoptosis that, in some instances, are difficult to reconcile. For instance, some evidence in the literature suggests that caspase-2 is the most apical caspase activated during heat-induced apoptosis (17Tu S. McStay G.P. Boucher L.M. Mak T. Beere H.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 21Bouchier-Hayes L. Oberst A. McStay G.P. Connell S. Tait S.W. Dillon C.P. Flanagan J.M. Beere H.M. Green D.R. Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 830-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and functions by cleaving Bid to tBid, which, in turn, triggers Bax/Bak-dependent MOMP (12Bonzon C. Bouchier-Hayes L. Pagliari L.J. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2150-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, a separate line of investigation found that caspase-2 is dispensable for heat-induced apoptosis and instead suggested that an unknown Z-VAD-inhibitable protease is the earliest protease activated in response to heat (13Milleron R.S. Bratton S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16991-17000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). According to that model, the unknown protease functions to initiate apoptosis, at least in part, by directly cleaving and activating caspase-3, suggesting that caspase-9 may not always be necessary for this form of apoptosis (13Milleron R.S. Bratton S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16991-17000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Other evidence suggests that Bax and Bak are activated directly by heat (13Milleron R.S. Bratton S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16991-17000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14Pagliari L.J. Kuwana T. Bonzon C. Newmeyer D.D. Tu S. Beere H.M. Green D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 17975-17980Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), an effect that can be enhanced by the ubiquitination and degradation of Mcl-1 (16Stankiewicz A.R. Livingstone A.M. Mohseni N. Mosser D.D. Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In light of the conflicting and, in some cases, contradictory nature of the reported data, we set out to better understand the molecular requirements necessary for heat-induced apoptosis. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, exposure of wild-type Jurkat cells to 1 h of hyperthermia at 44 °C followed by a 6-h incubation at 37 °C resulted in ∼32% of the cells undergoing apoptosis as determined by annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide co-staining. Heat-induced apoptosis was accompanied by the proteolytic cleavage of caspase-9, -8, -3, and -2, as well as an increase in caspase-3-like (DEVDase) activity (Fig. 1, B and C). In addition, incubation of cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor Q-VD-OPh (20 μm) for 1 h prior to heat exposure prevented cell death and caspase processing (data not shown), indicating that heat-induced apoptosis is a caspase-mediated event. Next, to determine whether the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was involved in this form of apoptosis, we evaluated the heat sensitivity of clones of Jurkat cells that do not undergo MOMP due to the overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (22Shawgo M.E. Shelton S.N. Robertson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35532-35538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 1D, Jurkat cells overexpressing either Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL were completely resistant to heat-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these data suggest that heat-induced cell death is a caspase-mediated apoptotic event that requires MOMP. Execution of apoptosis requires the activation of the caspase cascade, where active initiator caspases cleave and thereby activate downstream effector caspases that, in turn, dismantle the cell. Although proteolytic cleavage of an effector caspase is indicative of its activation, the same is not necessarily true with initiator caspases. There are currently two prevailing models for initiator caspase activation. The induced proximity model suggests that the adaptor molecules required for initiator caspase activation function to bring caspases into close proximity, leading to caspase homodimerization and subsequent activation (8Boatright K.M. Salvesen G.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). By comparison, the induced conformation model suggests that initiator caspases undergo a conformational change upon binding to an adaptor protein that leads to their activation (23Bao Q. Shi Y. Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Neither model suggests that cleavage is an activating event, although it was recently shown that dimerization and cleavage are necessary for caspase-8 activation (24Oberst A. Pop C. Tremblay A.G.

Because proteolytic cleavage of initiator caspases may not always reflect their activation and because synthetic peptide substrates are not specific for a particular caspase (25McStay G.P. Salvesen G.S. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), it has been technically challenging to identify apical caspases activated in response to a given insult. A recent study, however, used an innovative approach to affinity-label or ”trap“ initiator caspases as they become activated inside cells (17Tu S. McStay G.P. Boucher L.M. Mak T. Beere H.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The method relies on b-VAD-fmk and immobilized streptavidin to pull down the labeled caspase(s) (26Boatright K.M. Renatus M. Scott F.L. Sperandio S. Shin H. Pedersen I.M. Ricci J.E. Edris W.A. Sutherlin D.P. Green D.R. Salvesen G.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 529-541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar). In using this approach, we initially sought to determine the extent to which b-VAD-fmk pretreatment could inhibit heat-induced apoptosis. To that end, wild-type Jurkat cells were cultured in the presence of b-VAD-fmk (120 μm) for 3 h at 37 °C prior to being exposed to hyperthermia at 44 °C for 1 h followed by a 6-h incubation at 37 °C. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, b-VAD-fmk strongly inhibited heat-induced apoptosis as determined by annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide co-staining. Subsequently, duplicate aliquots of cells were lysed and incubated in the presence of streptavidin-Sepharose beads to pull down any activated caspases. To our surprise, b-VAD-fmk affinity-labeled caspase-2, -8, and -9 as initiator caspases that are activated early in response to hyperthermia (Fig. 2B, lane 3). However, the fact that significantly more caspase-9 was pulled down as compared with caspase-2 and caspase-8 suggested to us that caspase-9 might perform a more central role as an initiator caspase in this setting. Interestingly, previous studies have reported that caspase-8 can play a role in heat-induced apoptosis through a Fas-dependent mechanism (15Cippitelli M. Fionda C. Di Bona D. Piccoli M. Frati L. Santoni A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 17Tu S. McStay G.P. Boucher L.M. Mak T. Beere H.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For this reason and because caspase-8 was affinity-labeled as an activated initiator caspase in response to heat (Fig. 2B, lane 3), we first sought to determine the extent to which caspase-8 was important for heat-induced apoptosis. To do so, caspase-8-deficient Jurkat cells that have been described previously (27Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), and are completely resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis (20Shelton S.N. Shawgo M.E. Robertson J.D. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), were evaluated for their sensitivity to heat-induced apoptosis. As illustrated in Fig. 3, A and B, the results indicated that cells lacking caspase-8 underwent heat-induced apoptosis and processed caspase-9, -3, and -2 to the same extent as A3 control cells (Fig. 3, A and B), indicating that caspase-8 is not necessary in this setting. Having ruled out a significant role for caspase-8, we next investigated whether caspase-9 activation, which strictly depends on Apaf-1 (28Malladi S. Challa-Malladi M. Fearnhead H.O. Bratton S.B.

To do so, we used well characterized Apaf-1-deficient Jurkat cells that were shown previously to be (i) incapable of activating caspase-9 in vitro (31Shawgo M.E. Shelton S.N. Robertson J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 33447-33455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), (ii) highly resistant to mitochondria-mediated apoptosis induced by etoposide (18Franklin E.E.

https://openalex.org/W1994373518,"Background The electronic medical record (EMR) contains a rich source of information that could be harnessed for epidemic surveillance. We asked if structured EMR data could be coupled with computerized processing of free-text clinical entries to enhance detection of acute respiratory infections (ARI). Methodology A manual review of EMR records related to 15,377 outpatient visits uncovered 280 reference cases of ARI. We used logistic regression with backward elimination to determine which among candidate structured EMR parameters (diagnostic codes, vital signs and orders for tests, imaging and medications) contributed to the detection of those reference cases. We also developed a computerized free-text search to identify clinical notes documenting at least two non-negated ARI symptoms. We then used heuristics to build case-detection algorithms that best combined the retained structured EMR parameters with the results of the text analysis. Principal Findings An adjusted grouping of diagnostic codes identified reference ARI patients with a sensitivity of 79%, a specificity of 96% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 32%. Of the 21 additional structured clinical parameters considered, two contributed significantly to ARI detection: new prescriptions for cough remedies and elevations in body temperature to at least 38°C. Together with the diagnostic codes, these parameters increased detection sensitivity to 87%, but specificity and PPV declined to 95% and 25%, respectively. Adding text analysis increased sensitivity to 99%, but PPV dropped further to 14%. Algorithms that required satisfying both a query of structured EMR parameters as well as text analysis disclosed PPVs of 52–68% and retained sensitivities of 69–73%. Conclusion Structured EMR parameters and free-text analyses can be combined into algorithms that can detect ARI cases with new levels of sensitivity or precision. These results highlight potential paths by which repurposed EMR information could facilitate the discovery of epidemics before they cause mass casualties."
https://openalex.org/W2054591037,"Malignant hyperthermia (MH) and central core disease in humans have been associated with mutations in the skeletal ryanodine receptor (RyR1). Heterozygous mice expressing the human MH/central core disease RyR1 R163C mutation exhibit MH when exposed to halothane or heat stress. Considering that many MH symptoms resemble those that could ensue from a mitochondrial dysfunction (e.g. metabolic acidosis and hyperthermia) and that MH-susceptible mice or humans have a higher than normal cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration at rest, we evaluated the role of mitochondria in skeletal muscle from R163C compared with wild type mice under basal (untriggered) conditions. R163C skeletal muscle exhibited a significant increase in matrix Ca(2+), increased reactive oxygen species production, lower expression of mitochondrial proteins, and higher mtDNA copy number. These changes, in conjunction with lower myoglobin and glycogen contents, Myh4 and GAPDH transcript levels, GAPDH activity, and lower glucose utilization suggested a switch to a compromised bioenergetic state characterized by both low oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis. The shift in bioenergetic state was accompanied by a dysregulation of Ca(2+)-responsive signaling pathways regulated by calcineurin and ERK1/2. Chronically elevated resting Ca(2+) in R163C skeletal muscle elicited the maintenance of a fast-twitch fiber program and the development of insulin resistance-like phenotype as part of a metabolic adaptation to the R163C RyR1 mutation."
https://openalex.org/W2083731011,"Alternative splicing often produces effectors with opposite functions in apoptosis. Splicing decisions must therefore be tightly connected to stresses, stimuli, and pathways that control cell survival and cell growth. We have shown previously that PKC signaling prevents the production of proapoptotic Bcl-xS to favor the accumulation of the larger antiapoptotic Bcl-xL splice variant in 293 cells. Here we show that the genotoxic stress induced by oxaliplatin elicits an ATM-, CHK2-, and p53-dependent splicing switch that favors the production of the proapoptotic Bcl-xS variant. This DNA damage-induced splicing shift requires the activity of protein-tyrosine phosphatases. Interestingly, the ATM/CHK2/p53/tyrosine phosphatases pathway activated by oxaliplatin regulates Bcl-x splicing through the same regulatory sequence element (SB1) that receives signals from the PKC pathway. Convergence of the PKC and DNA damage signaling routes may control the abundance of a key splicing repressor because SB1-mediated repression is lost when protein synthesis is impaired but is rescued by blocking proteasome-mediated protein degradation. The SB1 splicing regulatory module therefore receives antagonistic signals from the PKC and the p53-dependent DNA damage response pathways to control the balance of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-x splice variants.

The SB1 splicing regulatory module therefore receives antagonistic signals from the PKC and the p53-dependent DNA damage response pathways to control the balance of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-x splice variants. A variety of extracellular stimuli and intracellular stresses, including DNA damage, promote cell death by triggering the apoptotic pathway. Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins play a critical role in the control of apoptosis and can display anti- or proapoptotic activity (1Adams J.M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2481-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar, 2Green D.R. Kroemer G. Science. 2004; 305: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar). Overexpressing antiapoptotic members or reducing the expression of proapoptotic proteins protect cells against death stimuli. In contrast, preventing the expression of antiapoptotic effectors promotes or sensitizes cells to death stimuli. Cell death is therefore controlled via a complex and delicate balance of pro- and antiapoptotic activities. Alternative splicing plays a major role in the control of apoptosis by dictating the production of different isoforms, often with opposite functions (3Schwerk C. Schulze-Osthoff K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of alternative splicing on apoptosis has been documented for many genes, including cell surface receptors, such as Fas; adaptor proteins and regulators, such as TRAF2 and APAF-1; mediators, such as Bcl-x, Bak, and Mcl-1; and caspases (3Schwerk C.

Bcl-x is produced in two forms through the use of alternative 5′ splice sites. Bcl-xL is antiapoptotic, whereas the shorter Bcl-xS variant is proapoptotic (6Boise L.H. González-García M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X. Nuñez G. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1993; 74: 597-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have reported high levels of Bcl-xL in cancer tissues, its overexpression conferring resistance to apoptotic stimuli and favoring metastasis (7Olopade O.I. Adeyanju M.O. Safa A.R.

Given the critical importance of maintaining an appropriate balance of pro- and antiapoptotic splice forms, splicing regulation must be tightly attuned to environmental stresses and intracellular demands. The two principal families of RNA binding proteins involved in alternative splicing regulation, the SR and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein families, are equipped to be on the receiving end of these pathways because they can be phosphorylated, a modification that can affect their activity and localization (11van der Houven van Oordt W.

However, the signaling pathways that carry information from stresses, stimuli, or drugs to kinases and phosphatases acting on splicing regulators remain poorly defined (16Filippov V. Filippova M. Duerksen-Hughes P.J. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 7621-7630Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Shi J. Hu Z. Pabon K. Scotto K.W. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and links between signal transduction and the alternative splicing control of apoptotic genes have rarely been reported. In one case, Fas activation and heat shock induce the de novo synthesis of ceramide, which in turn activates protein phosphatase 1 to stimulate the production of the proapoptotic Bcl-xS isoform (18Chalfant C.E. Ogretmen B. Galadari S. Kroesen B.J. Pettus B.J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44848-44855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast, the phosphorylation of Sam68 by Fyn favors the antiapoptotic Bcl-xL splice variant (19Paronetto M.P. Achsel T. Massiello A. Chalfant C.E. Sette C. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). More work is required to produce a comprehensive map of intersecting signaling routes triggered by different cues to coordinate Bcl-x splicing decisions. Recently, we showed that several anticancer drugs could modify the alternative splicing of Bcl-x (20Shkreta L. Froehlich U. Paquet E.R. Toutant J. Elela S.A. Chabot B. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 1398-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Among these, the genotoxic agents oxaliplatin and cisplatin displayed the broadest effect, shifting splicing in favor of the proapoptotic Bcl-xS splice variant in all cell lines tested. A recent study reported that UV irradiation increased the production of Bcl-xS, but the effect was independent of p53 (21Muñoz M.J. Pérez Santangelo M.S. Paronetto M.P. de la Mata M. Pelisch F. Boireau S. Glover-Cutter K. Ben-Dov C. Blaustein M. Lozano J.J. Bird G. Bentley D. Bertrand E. Kornblihtt A.R. Cell. 2009; 137: 708-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to investigate the pathway through which genotoxic compounds alter the balance of Bcl-x splice variants. Here we report that the increase in Bcl-xS induced by oxaliplatin requires p53 and is abrogated by inhibitors of ATM and CHK2 kinases. The splicing shift induced by the DNA damage response converges on the same regulatory element (SB1) used by the PKC signaling pathway to repress the 5′ splice site of Bcl-xS. Further, inhibiting tyrosine phosphatases antagonizes the SB1-mediated splicing shifts imposed by oxaliplatin and PKC inhibition. Thus, our results support a model in which a balance between PKC and tyrosine phosphatases activities determines the relative proportion of pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-x splicing variants. The convergence of signaling pathways on Bcl-x splicing control raised the possibility that phosphorylation may control the stability of a putative repressor interacting with the SB1 regulatory element. Consistent with this view, preventing proteasome-mediated protein degradation counteracted the splicing shift elicited by oxaliplatin or PKC inhibition. Finally, we observed that translation inhibition lifted the SB1-dependent repression and that proteasome inhibition rescued repression. Overall, our data suggest that PKC signaling stabilizes a low abundance splicing repressor, whereas the p53-dependent DNA damage response promotes its degradation through the proteasome pathway. Bcl-x splicing control is therefore tightly coordinated through translation efficiency, proteasome-mediated protein degradation, PKC signaling, and the p53-mediated response to DNA damage, thereby providing a striking example of the convergence of several and sometimes antagonistic pathways to control a splicing decision critical to cell fate. Human 293 cells (EcR-293, Invitrogen) were grown at 37 °C (5% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Oxaliplatin, cisplatin, and bortezomib were obtained from the Service Pharmaceutique du Centre de Chimiothérapie at the Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Sherbrooke. Emetine dihydrochloride, cycloheximide, staurosporine, MG132, CHK2 inhibitor II, and pifithrin-α were from Calbiochem. Caffeine, okadaic acid, sodium orthovanadate, microcystine-LR, and cyclosporine-A were from Sigma-Aldrich. Cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of individual drugs for 20 h unless specified otherwise. For methionine starvation treatments, cells were washed and incubated with DMEM depleted of methionine supplemented with 10% of dialyzed FBS (Wisent) for 20 h or as indicated. In the case of combinations of treatments, 293 cells were preincubated for 1 h prior to adding the second drug or application of Δ methionine treatment. For UV treatments, 293 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, irradiated without medium with 20 J/m2 of UV at 254 nm. Medium was added immediately after irradiation. To assess H2AX phosphorylation or the efficiency of knockdowns, whole cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells in Laemmli sample buffer and fractionating proteins on a polyacrylamide gel. Standard protocols were applied for Western blotting using an anti-phospho-H2AX (Upstate and Millipore), anti-ATM (Y170, Abcam), anti-CHK2 (a mixture of antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology recognizing phosphorylated Ser19, Ser33/35, Thr68, and Thr432), or anti-p53 antibody (Calbiochem). The same blots were decorated with an anti-β-actin antibody (A5316, Sigma-Aldrich) to evaluate total protein content in different lanes. To assess the efficiency of phosphatase inhibitors, total proteins were extracted from treated cells, and standard Western analysis was performed using an anti-diphosphorylated form of MAPK monoclonal antibody (M8159, Sigma-Aldrich) and anti-α-tubulin (4074, Abcam). 293 cells seeded in 96-well imaging plate (BD Biosciences) pretreated with poly-l-lysine were grown until a confluence of about 40% before treating with oxaliplatin for 20 h. Cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, permeabilized using 0.1% of Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature, washed with PBS, and then blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. The primary antibody, a mouse anti-phospho-H2AX (1:500) was added to cells for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed with 0.05% Tween and PBS and then incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibody (1:250), a goat anti-mouse IgG1 Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated (Invitrogen), and a solution of Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen). After removal of the secondary antibody and Hoechst, cells were washed with 0.05% Tween and PBS. Controls without the primary antibody were always included. Cells were examined, and images were captured using a BD Pathway 855 High-Content Bioimager (BD Biosciences) and ×20 U-Apo 340 objective (Olympus). Sixteen images for each well were acquired and analyzed using the Attovision 1.6 software (BD Biosciences), allowing fluorescence measurements of individual cells. Bcl-x inserts of plasmids X2 and X2.13 were produced by PCR amplification using plasmids CMV-X2 and CMV-X2.13 (22Garneau D. Revil T. Fisette J.F. Chabot B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22641-22650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) as templates, the Pfu-Turbo polymerase, and primers AscI-X-Fwd (GGCGCGCCTCACTATAGGGAGACCCAAGCTGGCTAG) and X-Age-Rev (CTTACCGGTGGATCCCCCGGGCTGCAGGAATTCGAT). The derived PCR products were cleaved with AscI and AgeI and ligated into SVEDA-HIV-2 vector (a generous gift of Alberto Kornblihtt) cut with the same enzymes. Plasmid transfections were carried out with polyethyleneimide (Polysciences Inc.), and conditions for transfection of 293 cells were as described (23Revil T. Toutant J. Shkreta L. Garneau D. Cloutier P. Chabot B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 8431-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For knockdowns, 293 cells were transfected with an ATM-specific siRNA (AAGCACCAGUCCAGUAUUGGCdTdT) (24Won J. Kim M. Kim N. Ahn J.H. Lee W.G. Kim S.S. Chang K.Y. Yi Y.W. Kim T.K. Nat. Chem.

Lukas J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 884-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and a p53-specific siRNA (GCAUGAACCGGAGGCCCAUdTdT) (Qiagen). Drugs and other treatments or transfection of Bcl-x minigenes were applied 48 h post-treatment with the siRNAs, and cells were collected 24 h after to verify depletion through Western analysis and Bcl-x splicing profiles using RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from treated or transfected cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen) using the procedure described by the manufacturer. The splicing profile of Bcl-x was assessed by RT-PCR. Reverse transcription was done using the OmniScript RT kit (Qiagen) with random hexamers for endogenously derived Bcl-x mRNAs, whereas oligonucleotide RT3 (GAAGGCACAGTCGAGGCTG) was used for the plasmid-derived mRNAs. One-tenth of cDNA material was used as template for the PCR. Primers X3 (ATGGCAGCAGTAAAGCAAGCG) and X2 (TCATTTCCGACTGAAGAGTGA) were used to amplify fragments of splicing isoforms derived from endogenous Bcl-x, whereas primers X34 (AGGGAGGCAGGCGACGGCGACGAGTTT) and X-Age-Rev were used for plasmid-derived transcripts. For the conventional PCR, [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Canada Inc.) was added to PCR mixtures, and amplification products were fractionated onto a 4% native polyacrylamide gel. Gels were exposed on screens that were scanned on a STORM PhosphorImager 860 (GE Healthcare). The intensity of the bands was quantified using the ImageQuant software. For RT-PCR data and protein synthesis assays, the two-tailed Student's t test was used to compare the means between samples and their respective controls. p values are represented by asterisks (* p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). The absence of asterisks indicates that the changes relative to controls are not statistically significant. To determine the effect of inhibitors on protein synthesis, cells were treated with individual inhibitors or methionine-depleted medium for 20 h and then washed and incubated with DMEM lacking cysteine supplemented with dialyzed FBS and 5 μCi/well [35S]cysteine (PerkinElmer Canada Inc.) and inhibitors or medium lacking methionine for an additional 4 h. After collecting cells and washing them with PBS, they were treated with 10% TCA and incubated on ice for 30 min before centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. Pellets were then treated with 0.1 n NaOH overnight at 37 °C. Aliquots of NaOH-treated samples were transferred to scintillation vials for counting. A second aliquot of each sample was used to determine protein concentration by the Lowry method. The [35S]cysteine incorporation rate was expressed as cpm/μg of TCA-precipitated protein. In a previous study (20Shkreta L. Froehlich U. Paquet E.R. Toutant J. Elela S.A. Chabot B. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 1398-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we showed that several anti-cancer agents alter the alternative splicing of Bcl-x. Among these, the genotoxic compounds oxaliplatin and cisplatin displayed the broadest spectrum of activity because they increased the production of the Bcl-xS mRNA splice variant in all cell lines that were tested, including 293 cells (Fig. 1A). Oxaliplatin probably promotes the formation of double-stranded DNA breaks because the levels of phosphorylated H2AX increased with time as judged by Western analysis (Fig. 1B) or after 24 h of treatment as detected by immunofluorescence (Fig. 1C). H2AX can be phosphorylated by the ATM and ATR kinases that sense DNA damage (26Ward I.M. Chen J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42462-42467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar), and we further observed that the Bcl-x splicing shift induced by oxaliplatin is compromised by caffeine, which inhibits the ATM/ATR kinases, and by an inhibitor of CHK2, a kinase activated by ATM/ATR (Fig. 1, D and F, respectively). Notably, the level of phosphorylated CHK2 was increased upon treatment with oxaliplatin (Fig. 1F), consistent with an induced DNA damage pathway. The role of ATM and CHK2 on Bcl-x splicing control was confirmed by RNA interference using siRNAs (Fig. 1, E and G). Because p53 is a target of CHK2, we next tested the contribution of p53 in Bcl-x splicing by interfering with p53 function. The partial depletion of p53 by siRNA-mediated RNA interference promoted a significant reduction (p < 0.01) in the oxaliplatin-induced shift in 293 cells (Fig. 1H). We also tested the p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α (28Komarov P.G. Komarova E.A. Kondratov R.V. Christov-Tselkov K. Coon J.S. Chernov M.V. Gudkov A.V. Science. 1999; 285: 1733-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar) and noted a similar capacity to compromise the splicing shift elicited by oxaliplatin (Fig. 1I). The depletion or inhibition of ATM, CHK2, and p53 had no effect on Bcl-x splicing in cells that were not treated with oxaliplatin (Fig. 1, D–I). The results presented here and below have been reproduced with cisplatin, and we chose not to present the cisplatin data for reasons of space. We previously reported a role for PKC in the splicing control of Bcl-x in 293 cells (23Revil T. Toutant J. Shkreta L. Garneau D. Cloutier P. Chabot B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 8431-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PKC regulation of Bcl-x splicing occurs through a 361-nucleotide-long regulatory sequence (SB1) located in the first half of exon 2 (Fig. 2A). SB1 behaves as a silencer because its deletion stimulates the use of the Bcl-xS 5′ splice site and prevents further shifting upon PKC inhibition (23Revil T. Toutant J. Shkreta L. Garneau D. Cloutier P. Chabot B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 8431-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine if oxaliplatin acts through SB1, we tested its ability to shift the splicing of transcripts derived from minigenes containing or lacking SB1 (X2 and X2.13, respectively; Fig. 2A). Notably, oxaliplatin increased the relative use of the Bcl-xS 5′ splice site only when SB1 was present (Fig. 2B). The knockdown of p53 or its inhibition by pifithrin compromised the SB1-mediated increase in the production of Bcl-xS imposed by oxaliplatin (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, oxaliplatin alters Bcl-x splicing through a p53-dependent pathway that converges on the same regulatory element that is used by PKC. The convergence of the PKC and DNA damage response pathways was supported by showing that depleting or inhibiting p53 significantly reduced the amplitude of the splicing shift induced by staurosporine (Fig. 3, A and B) and required the SB1 element (Fig. 3, C and D). That a drop in p53 could counteract the impact of a potent PKC inhibitor indicates that the p53 pathway does not converge directly on PKC. The DNA damage and PKC pathways therefore appear distinct but may converge on a common splicing regulator. One way through which the PKC and the DNA damage response pathways may antagonistically regulate the same splicing decision is by controlling the phosphorylation of a key regulator. For example, the PKC pathway may phosphorylate a protein that represses splicing to the Bcl-xS 5′ splice site, whereas DNA damage may elicit the dephosphorylation of the same repressor. Thus, a drop in the level of a phosphorylated repressor (as when PKC is inhibited) could be compensated for by reducing the dephosphorylation rate of the repressor (as when p53 is depleted). If p53 up-regulates the activity of a phosphatase that targets this repressor, then phosphatase inhibitors should antagonize the impact of oxaliplatin and staurosporine. To test this hypothesis, we treated 293 cells with a variety of phosphatase inhibitors with the goal of identifying a class of phosphatases that control Bcl-x splicing in a manner that requires the SB1 element. Most inhibitors antagonized the splicing switch induced by oxaliplatin and staurosporine (supplemental Fig. S1). The strongest effect was obtained with the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate, which nearly completely neutralized the effect of oxaliplatin and staurosporine (Fig. 4A). As observed with the inhibitors of ATM/ATR, CHK2, and p53, the phosphatase inhibitors did not affect Bcl-x splicing in cells grown in the absence of the drugs oxaliplatin and staurosporine (CTRL lanes in supplemental Fig. S1 and Fig. 4A). To ask if the activity of the phosphatases occurred through the SB1 regulatory module, we tested the impact of some of the inhibitors on the splicing of transcripts derived from X2 and the SB1-lacking X2.13 minigenes. Orthovanadate antagonized the splicing shifts induced by oxaliplatin and staurosporine when Bcl-x contained the SB1 element (X2) but had no significant impact when SB1 was absent (X2.13) (Fig. 4B). In contrast, okadaic acid and the other inhibitors decreased the production of Bcl-xS on both X2 and X2.13-derived transcripts (Fig. 4C) (data not shown). To confirm the role of protein-tyrosine phosphatases in Bcl-x splicing control, we tested a different inhibitor developed to inhibit principally PTP-1B and TC-PTP but that can also affect the activity of other tyrosine phosphatases at higher concentrations (29Stuible M. Zhao L. Aubry I. Schmidt-Arras D. Böhmer F.D. Li C.J. Tremblay M.L. Chembiochem. 2007; 8: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The PTP-1B/TC-PTP inhibitor displayed a marked ability to counteract the Bcl-x splicing shifts induced by oxaliplatin and staurosporine (Fig. 4D). Moreover, this antagonizing activity occurred only when the SB1 regulatory element was present (Fig. 4E). Thus, our results are consistent with the view that DNA damage stimulates tyrosine phosphatases acting through the SB1 element. Regulating the activity of splicing modulators through phosphorylation is an emerging theme (30Novoyatleva T. Heinrich B. Tang Y. Benderska N. Butchbach M.E. Lorson C.L. Lorson M.A. Ben-Dov C.

Ghosh G. Fu X.D. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 482-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation status of a protein may dictate its localization, as is the case for heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 and SR proteins (31Stamm S. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1223-1227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation can also trigger an interaction with other proteins, as is the case for the splicing repressor SRp38 (35Feng Y. Chen M. Manley J.L. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1040-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the transcriptional activator SRC-3 by atypical PKC shields it from proteasomal degradation (36Yi P. Feng Q. Amazit L. Lonard D.M. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 465-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because our results support a model whereby a splicing repressor binding to SB1 exists in a non-phosphorylated and a phosphorylated state, we wanted to test if the signaling events triggered by the PKC and DNA damage pathways might be linked to protein stability. We therefore monitored the impact of 26 S subunit proteasome inhibitors on Bcl-x splicing. Although by themselves bortezomib and MG132 (37Crawford L.J. Walker B. Ovaa H. Chauhan D. Anderson K.C. Morris T.C. Irvine A.E. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 6379-6386Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) did not affect the production of the Bcl-x splice isoforms in 293 cells, they antagonized very efficiently the Bcl-x splicing shift elicited by oxaliplatin (Fig. 5A). Bortezomib and MG132 also completely neutralized the impact of staurosporine (Fig. 5B). Inhibiting PKC or increasing the activity of tyrosine phosphatases through DNA damage may possibly shift the equilibrium toward an unphosphorylated form of the repressor that becomes a target for the proteasome, thereby lifting repression to encourage the production of Bcl-xS. In contrast, impairing proteasomal activity in these conditions would permit the accumulation of the unphosphorylated repressor, a situation that would maintain repression. If protein degradation controls the level of a crucial splicing regulator of Bcl-x, its production may be similarly regulated. An indication that this might be the case was our previous observation that inhibiting protein synthesis with cycloheximide increased the production of Bcl-xS (23Revil T. Toutant J. Shkreta L. Garneau D. Cloutier P. Chabot B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 8431-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Another group reported a similar effect on Bcl-x using emetine and cycloheximide but proposed that the shift in Bcl-x splicing might be independent of protein synthesis (38Boon-Unge K. Yu Q. Zou T. Zhou A. Govitrapong P. Zhou J. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 1386-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To clarify the contribution of protein synthesis to Bcl-x splicing control, we tested the impact of a drug-free translational block. As with emetine and cycloheximide, incubating 293 cells in a medium lacking methionine compromised protein synthesis (Fig. 6A) and increased the production of Bcl-xS (Fig. 6B). Thus, a block in protein synthesis disrupts Bcl-x splicing regulation, suggesting that the availability of an important splicing regulator may be nearly limiting. Next we asked if the activity of this low abundance repressor was linked to the SB1 regulatory module. We transfected Bcl-x minigenes containing or lacking SB1 (X2 and X2.13, respectively) in 293 cells treated with medium containing emetine or cycloheximide or lacking methionine. All treatments stimulated the production of Bcl-xS but only when SB1 was present (Fig. 6C), indicating that inefficient protein synthesis counteracts the repression mediated by SB1. This result suggests that the factor existing at nearly limiting concentrations is the same one onto which converges regulation by the PKC and p53-dependent DNA damage pathways. The above model also predicts that the impact of translation defects may be delayed by inhibiting proteasome-mediated protein degradation. Indeed, bortezomib and MG132 antagonized to vario"

IntroductionThyroglobulin (Tg) 3The abbreviations used are: TgthyroglobulinMITmonoiodotyrosineDITdiiodotyrosineT3triiodothyronineT4thyroxineendo-GluCendoproteinase GluCHCDhigher energy collision dissociationCIDcollision-induced dissociationBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. is one of the most abundant proteins produced by the thyroid gland and comprises two identical subunits of ∼330 kDa. This prohormonal glycoprotein is secreted by thyroid epithelial cells. It is stored in the lumen of thyroid follicles in a highly condensed and covalently cross-linked form with numerous disulfide bridges. There, Tg is used as a scaffold for thyroid hormonogenesis and as an iodine reservoir. Many post-translational modifications are known to occur on this protein such as glycosylation, sulfation, and iodination (1Deshpande V. Venkatesh S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 157-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A signal peptide is processed during its export to the lumen. The most specific Tg post-translational modification is certainly its iodination and 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) thyroid hormone synthesis. Indeed, through the combined action of NADPH oxidase and thyroperoxidase on the outer surface of the thyrocyte apical membrane, iodide ions that are also transported to the follicular lumen are covalently linked to some Tg tyrosyl residues to form mono- or diiodotyrosines (MIT or DIT, respectively). Coupling of two of these DIT residues then leads to the formation of T4 at an acceptor site, whereas coupling one MIT and one DIT moiety essentially forms T3 (2Taurog A. Dorris M.L. Doerge D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this reaction, the release of an iodotyrosyl moiety at the donor site leaves an “empty” side chain and the fate of this unusual residue is controversial. Some authors claim that a dehydroalanine is left instead of the tyrosine, whereas others observed pyruvic acid associated with cleavage of the polypeptide chain (3Dunn A.D. Corsi C.M. Myers H.E.

The principal proteases involved include the cathepsins (B, D, K, L, and S, with more or less specific roles ranging from solubilizing the highly cross-linked forms of Tg to releasing the hormone moiety), aminopeptidase N and dipeptidylpeptidases (8Brix K.

BMC Biochem. 2009; 10: 23Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).Studies of the post-translational modification of Tg began in the 1950s using radioactive iodide. Researchers attributed the radioactivity to different Tg fractions according to their sedimentation coefficient or molecular weight on SDS-PAGE gel. Later, Tg fragments obtained by proteolysis with trypsin or other proteases were separated by reversed-phase HPLC. The amount of radioactivity and the chemical form of the iodinated residues (MIT, DIT, T3, or T4) were then analyzed (13Gavaret J.M. Dème D. Nunez J. Salvatore G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3281-3285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lejeune P.J. Marriq C. Rolland M. Lissitzky S.

Biophys. 1983; 222: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Most of the studies were performed on purified Tg or Tg fragments from bovine, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, or human tissues, after in vitro chemical iodination or not. Significant progress was made in the 1980s when the first polypeptide sequence was reported for Bos taurus (16Mercken L. Simons M.J. Swillens S. Massaer M. Vassart G. Nature. 1985; 316: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The tyrosine residues involved were then identified more accurately using Edman amino acid sequencing and, later, mass spectrometry (MS) to identify the peptides. These experiments led to the establishment of a list of a number of iodinated tyrosine residues. Nonetheless, except for peptide identification, little has been done concerning MS-based characterization of tyrosine iodination. An initial attempt was made using purified (1237–1610) bovine Tg tryptic fragment (full sequence numbering). After endoproteinase Asp-N digestion, the resulting peptides were resolved by reversed-phase liquid chromatography and analyzed by electrospray and fast atom bombardment MS (6Gentile F. Ferranti P. Mamone G. Malorni A. Salvatore G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 639-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The post-translational modifications of all seven tyrosine residues on this fragment were characterized at an unprecedented level of resolution, highlighting Tyr1310 as a new T3 and T4 acceptor site, and unveiling a dehydroalanine at position 1394 as a donor site residue. After proteolysis and reversed-phase separation as well, Dunn and co-workers (3Dunn A.D. Corsi C.M. Myers H.E. Dunn J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25223-25229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) used MS to identify another donor site (Tyr149) on bovine Tg with the presence of pyruvic acid. Finally, in a more technical study in 2005, Salek and Lehmann (17Salek M. Lehmann W.D. Proteomics. 2005; 5: 351-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) tackled the problem of iodotyrosine identification. They showed that peptides containing a mono- or diiodotyrosine residue generated specific markers during collisional-induced dissociation (CID) fragmentation.To study post-translational modifications of Tg in the thyroid and their heterogeneity, we proposed to analyze them using the most direct strategy possible, avoiding all purification steps and their inherent bias, and without the need for radioactivity. We dissected thyroid glands from mice and directly analyzed Tg using a shotgun-based MS/MS approach. We revealed as many tyrosine positions as possible by using a combination of different proteases and different MS/MS fragmentation procedures, involving analysis with inclusion lists, and using a high-resolution LTQ-Orbitrap XL hybrid mass spectrometer. We identified 37 modified tyrosine residues in mouse tissue, whereas only 16 sites are known for human Tg. Of these, we clearly identified 4 hormonogenic sites and two donor sites by identifying a pyruvic residue instead of the initial tyrosine. The analysis of cathepsin and dipeptidyl cleavage sites provided information of what happens in the cells. Our panoramic results bring new challenging data relative to Tg post-translational modifications.DISCUSSIONTg is a polypeptide matrix necessary for the synthesis of thyroid hormones. It is a very large glycoprotein consisting of two identical chains of 330 kDa. The numerous studies carried out so far have only led to a partial and indirect survey of its degree of iodination. Table 1 shows the positions of the iodinated tyrosines in both mouse and human Tg. A more general view of the status of Tg modification has been attempted through review work and many results have been deduced similarity with other established sequences, but were not always demonstrated (6Gentile F. Ferranti P. Mamone G. Malorni A. Salvatore G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 639-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 34Dunn J.T. Kim P.S. Dunn A.D. Heppner Jr., D.G.

Chem. 1990; 265: 8887-8892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) noted that of the 140 tyrosines in the Tg dimer in rats, only 25–30 are normally iodinated and a much smaller number undergo coupling to form thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). Dunn et al. (38Dunn J.T. Anderson P.C. Fox J.W. Fassler C.A. Dunn A.D. Hite L.A. Moore R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16948-16952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Dunn J.T. Dunn A.D. Biochimie. 1999; 81: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) mentioned the presence of four essential hormonogenic sites in rabbit Tg. Those sites, designated A, B, C, and D, were found either experimentally or by homology when the cDNA sequences were established (16Mercken L. Simons M.J. Swillens S. Massaer M. Vassart G. Nature. 1985; 316: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 40Malthiéry Y. Lissitzky S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 41Musti A.M. Avvedimento E.V. Polistina C. Ursini V.M. Obici S. Nitsch L. Cocozza S. Di Lauro R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These sites correspond to tyrosyl numbers 5, 2553, 2746, and 1290, respectively (this numbering applies to the mature Tg rabbit molecule, omits the peptide signal, and corresponds to positions 25, 2572, 2764, and 1310 in the mouse sequence with its presequence). Sites A and B are T4 and T3 sites; D is exclusively T4, and C mainly T3. As summarized in Table 1, our proteomic approach provides the broadest panoramic survey ever achieved using native Tg. The sequence coverage for Tg is very high (89% when iodination modifications are included). In the present study, we detected mouse equivalent hormonogenic sites A, B, and D. In our case, sites B and D carry T4 and T3, whereas site A carries only T4. By analogy with other Tg mammals, site C (Tyr2764, mouse numbering) is located at the C terminus. In our proteomic strategy, the SYSK peptide containing Tyr2764 generated by trypsin was too small to be detected by the mass spectrometer unless a limited proteolysis strategy was used. As far as triiodothyronine is concerned, we demonstrated its presence at positions Tyr2572 (site B), Tyr1310 (site D), and also at Tyr993 (mouse numbering) as mentioned in Table 1. This latter position has not previously been described as a hormonogenic site. It should be noted that we did not detect triiodothyronine at position 25 (site A).We have already mentioned that the sequence coverage obtained for Tg was very high. We wondered why some regions were not covered and noted that most of the undetected peptides carry a potential glycosylation site as predicted by bioinformatic tools based on homology with other species. The number of tyrosyl residues detected (71 of 76), particularly the number of mono- or diiodinated tyrosines, 36 and 24, respectively, is higher than had ever been found before (37Palumbo G. Gentile F. Condorelli G.L. Salvatore G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8887-8892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If we consider that only a few positions (4 in our study) are involved in hormonogenesis we might think that the coupling process is highly regioselective and probably driven by constraints because of the native three-dimensional structure of Tg. The abundant iodination found in mouse Tg is probably a storage process for iodine, which can be mobilized when iodine intake becomes limited. More iodination sites were found in mouse Tg compared with those previously identified in the thyroids of larger mammals. This difference may be related to the more active thyroid metabolism in smaller animals or to the greater sensitivity of our methodology.Dunn et al. (39Dunn J.T. Dunn A.D. Biochimie. 1999; 81: 505-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) proposed a classification of iodinated tyrosyl groups into three consensus families: ((D/E)Y), ((S/T)YS)), and (EXY) motives. (i) The ((D/E)Y) di-amino acid consensus was associated with T4 at sites A, B, and D. This is also the case in mouse Tg as supported by our results. It should be noted that the novel T3 site characterized here at residue 993 belongs to this EY consensus. Moreover, this consensus sequence is found iodinated but with apparently no hormone formation at four other locations Tyr383 (DY), Tyr1115 (EY), Tyr2486 (DY), and Tyr2586 (DY). (ii) The ((S/T)YS) tri-amino acid consensus was associated with triiodothyronine synthesis at site C. In the present study, we noticed that of the 36 mono- or 24 diiodotyrosines none could be linked to this consensus group because the sequence ((S/T)YS) is only present at position 2764 (mouse numbering). (iii) The consensus sequence (EXY) appeared to favor iodination. Of 8 possibilities of this consensus in mouse Tg, 6 are iodinated sites as shown here. We can increase this figure to 9 of 12 if we include an extended ((E/D)XY) consensus sequence. This ratio is significantly higher than the mean ratio of 36 iodinated positions of 71 detectable tyrosine residues. Our results confirmed that the presence of an acidic residue located two amino acids upstream of a tyrosine promotes iodination.Identifying donor tyrosyl residues has been a difficult challenge for years. At donor sites, the coupling process should leave dehydroalanine, which may be converted to alanine, pyruvic acid, or acetic acid during subsequent isolation steps (5Gavaret J.M. Nunez J.

(6Gentile F. Ferranti P. Mamone G. Malorni A. Salvatore G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 639-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) noted that the identification of donor tyrosyl residues was indirect in all the cases reported so far. In their study, they claimed to provide the first direct identification of tyrosine 1375 in mature bovine Tg (not conserved in humans or mice) as a donor residue. This result was obtained by taking into account the fact that tyrosine was converted into dehydroalanine. They used electrospray MS with 250–500 ppm precision. In 1998, Dunn et al. (3Dunn A.D. Corsi C.M. Myers H.E. Dunn J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25223-25229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) using also electrospray MS demonstrated a cleavage in the polypeptidic chain in bovine Tg, and identified a peptide in which Tyr130 (Tyr150 in mouse numbering) was replaced by pyruvate. In our large dataset, we were unable to detect any peptide displaying a dehydroalanine modification, whereas working to 5 ppm precision, even when the parent mass list was included. We identified two donor tyrosine residues at N-terminal and C-terminal fragments of the Tg molecule with peptide bond cleavage, and demonstrated the presence of pyruvic acid replacing the tyrosine residue. Our thyroid-wide proteomic analysis suggests that the residual side chain is converted to pyruvic acid in vivo or in vitro after iodotyrosyl transfer. We do not have any evidence that this cleavage occurs in the thyroid in vivo but we wonder whether the acidic conditions used during subsequent experimental manipulations were severe enough to break the peptide bond. In any case, detection of this cleavage event provides clear evidence for donor site identification.Although MS is widely used in the analysis of post-translational protein modifications (44Jensen O.N. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 45Küster B. Mann M. Curr. Opin. Struct.

Methods. 2007; 4: 798-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), it has rarely been used to identify iodinated tyrosyl residues in Tg and only on fragmented Tg (3Dunn A.D. Corsi C.M. Myers H.E.

Here, we report the first detailed analysis of the entire Tg molecule from a direct, fresh extract of the mouse thyroid gland. Using this strategy, we obtained unambiguous characterization of 71 tyrosyl residues of this huge protein, confirmed the presence of three thyroxine sites and three triiodothyronine sites, and detected one new T3 site (Tyr993). From the same dataset, we were able to characterize two hormonogenic donor tyrosines at each end of the molecule. Based on spectral count, the ratio of the number of detected spectra for modified to unmodified peptides can be calculated for each modified tyrosine site. Because each peptide has its own ionization characteristics, this ratio is not very informative per se but it could become very enlightening when comparing Tg iodination levels under different conditions such as pathophysiological states. The use of isotope synthetic peptides carrying the different iodinated forms using a stable isotope dilution strategy (47Keshishian H. Addona T. Burgess M. Kuhn E. Carr S.A. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 2212-2229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) could also be used to record the absolute quantity of each major modification.The release of thyroid hormones from the Tg prohormone requires the presence of different cathepsins, B, D, and L (9Dunn A.D. Crutchfield H.E. Dunn J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20198-20204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Friedrichs et al. (11Friedrichs B. Tepel C. Reinheckel T. Deussing J. von Figura K. Herzog V. Peters C. Saftig P. Brix K. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1733-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) noted that this rather complex process involves sequential proteolytic events with some interaction with different cathepsins, B, K, and L (48Tepel C. Brömme D. Herzog V. Brix K. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4487-4498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Covalently cross-linked Tg is stored in the thyroid follicular lumen where limited proteolysis occurs. Tg processing continues under intracellular conditions after Tg fragment internalization (12Jordans S. Jenko-Kokalj S. Kühl N.M. Tedelind S. Sendt W. Brömme D. Turk D. Brix K. BMC Biochem. 2009; 10: 23Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our organ-oriented data were obtained from a complex mixture of partially or fully degraded Tg. Novel proteomic strategies, such as those developed to label N-terminal extremities for degradosome or proteogenomic studies (19Baudet M. Ortet P. Gaillard J.C. Fernandez B. Guerin P. Enjalbal C. Subra G. de Groot A. Barakat M. Dedieu A. Armengaud J. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2010; 9: 415-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), could be developed to follow the in vivo degradation process in thyroid follicules more accurately.In conclusion, in this study, we established the iodination status of Tg in mice. Our direct organ to mass spectrometer shotgun approach revealed a more comprehensive set of iodination sites in Tg. Our methodology may be applied to analyze whether potential alteration in the process of Tg iodination could be detected. This study could be carried out on thyroid extracts from various mouse models, such as Tg processing or iodine uptake using genetically modified mutants. Drugs that modify the Tg iodination status could also be investigated with this type of monitoring. The approach does not require large samples. It should be straightforward in application to human thyroid punctures, which could be important for clinical studies on iodination dysfunction. IntroductionThyroglobulin (Tg) 3The abbreviations used are: TgthyroglobulinMITmonoiodotyrosineDITdiiodotyrosineT3triiodothyronineT4thyroxineendo-GluCendoproteinase GluCHCDhigher energy collision dissociationCIDcollision-induced dissociationBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. is one of the most abundant proteins produced by the thyroid gland and comprises two identical subunits of ∼330 kDa. This prohormonal glycoprotein is secreted by thyroid epithelial cells. It is stored in the lumen of thyroid follicles in a highly condensed and covalently cross-linked form with numerous disulfide bridges. There, Tg is used as a scaffold for thyroid hormonogenesis and as an iodine reservoir. Many post-translational modifications are known to occur on this protein such as glycosylation, sulfation, and iodination (1Deshpande V. Venkatesh S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1430: 157-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A signal peptide is processed during its export to the lumen. The most specific Tg post-translational modification is certainly its iodination and 3,5,3′-triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) thyroid hormone synthesis. Indeed, through the combined action of NADPH oxidase and thyroperoxidase on the outer surface of the thyrocyte apical membrane, iodide ions that are also transported to the follicular lumen are covalently linked to some Tg tyrosyl residues to form mono- or diiodotyrosines (MIT or DIT, respectively). Coupling of two of these DIT residues then leads to the formation of T4 at an acceptor site, whereas coupling one MIT and one DIT moiety essentially forms T3 (2Taurog A. Dorris M.L. Doerge D.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 24-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this reaction, the release of an iodotyrosyl moiety at the donor site leaves an “empty” side chain and the fate of this unusual residue is controversial. Some authors claim that a dehydroalanine is left instead of the tyrosine, whereas others observed pyruvic acid associated with cleavage of the polypeptide chain (3Dunn A.D. Corsi C.M. Myers H.E.

The principal proteases involved include the cathepsins (B, D, K, L, and S, with more or less specific roles ranging from solubilizing the highly cross-linked forms of Tg to releasing the hormone moiety), aminopeptidase N and dipeptidylpeptidases (8Brix K.

BMC Biochem. 2009; 10: 23Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).Studies of the post-translational modification of Tg began in the 1950s using radioactive iodide. Researchers attributed the radioactivity to different Tg fractions according to their sedimentation coefficient or molecular weight on SDS-PAGE gel. Later, Tg fragments obtained by proteolysis with trypsin or other proteases were separated by reversed-phase HPLC. The amount of radioactivity and the chemical form of the iodinated residues (MIT, DIT, T3, or T4) were then analyzed (13Gavaret J.M. Dème D. Nunez J. Salvatore G. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3281-3285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lejeune P.J. Marriq C. Rolland M. Lissitzky S.

Biophys. 1983; 222: 245-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Most of the studies were performed on purified Tg or Tg fragments from bovine, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, or human tissues, after in vitro chemical iodination or not. Significant progress was made in the 1980s when the first polypeptide sequence was reported for Bos taurus (16Mercken L. Simons M.J. Swillens S. Massaer M. Vassart G. Nature. 1985; 316: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The tyrosine residues involved were then identified more accurately using Edman amino acid sequencing and, later, mass spectrometry (MS) to identify the peptides. These experiments led to the establishment of a list of a number of iodinated tyrosine residues. Nonetheless, except for peptide identification, little has been done concerning MS-based characterization of tyrosine iodination. An initial attempt was made using purified (1237–1610) bovine Tg tryptic fragment (full sequence numbering). After endoproteinase Asp-N digestion, the resulting peptides were resolved by reversed-phase liquid chromatography and analyzed by electrospray and fast atom bombardment MS (6Gentile F. Ferranti P.

https://openalex.org/W2008297718,"IRF-7 is the master regulator of type I interferon-dependent immune responses controlling both innate and adaptive immunity. Given the significance of IRF-7 in the induction of immune responses, many viruses have developed strategies to inhibit its activity to evade or antagonize host antiviral responses. We previously demonstrated that ORF45, a KSHV immediate-early protein as well as a tegument protein of virions, interacts with IRF-7 and inhibits virus-mediated type I interferon induction by blocking IRF-7 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation (Zhu, F. X., King, S. M., Smith, E. J., Levy, D. E., and Yuan, Y. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 99, 5573–5578). In this report, we sought to reveal the mechanism underlying the ORF45-mediated inactivation of IRF-7. We found that ORF45 interacts with the inhibitory domain of IRF-7. The most striking feature in the IRF-7 inhibitory domain is two α-helices H3 and H4 that contain many hydrophobic residues and two β-sheets located between the helices that are also very hydrophobic. These hydrophobic subdomains mediate intramolecular interactions that keep the molecule in a closed (inactive) form. Mutagenesis studies confirm the contribution of the hydrophobic helices and sheets to the autoinhibition of IRF-7 in the absence of viral signal. The binding of ORF45 to the critical domain of IRF-7 leads to a hypothesis that ORF45 may maintain the IRF-7 molecule in the closed form and prevent it from being activated in response to viral infection.

Two closely related members within this family, namely IRF-3 and IRF-7, have been identified as the key regulators mediating the induction of type I IFNs (α/β) following a viral infection (5Sato M. Suemori H. Hata N. Asagiri M. Ogasawara K. Nakao K. Nakaya T. Katsuki M. Noguchi S. Tanaka N. Taniguchi T.

Type I IFNs thus elicited the trigger for the transcription of downstream antiviral effector proteins, which through pleiotropic effects target and inhibit distinct stages in the viral life cycle ultimately helping to relieve the host cell of the viral burden (8Sadler A.J.

IRF-7 has been known to be the master regulator of type I interferon-dependent immune responses. The role of IRF-7 in the type I IFN induction pathway was earlier assessed employing IRF-7 deficient mice (IRF-7−/−) (10Honda K. Yanai H. Negishi H. Asagiri M. Sato M. Mizutani T. Shimada N. Ohba Y. Takaoka A. Yoshida N. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2005; 434: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar, 11Honda K. Yanai H. Takaoka A. Taniguchi T. Int. Immunity. 2005; 17: 1367-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). In mouse embryonic fibroblasts isolated from these mice, following experimental viral infection, levels of type I IFN induction was found to be severely impaired, compared with levels obtained with the IRF-3 deficient mice (IRF-3−/−) (10Honda K. Yanai H. Negishi H. Asagiri M. Sato M. Mizutani T. Shimada N. Ohba Y. Takaoka A. Yoshida N. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2005; 434: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar, 11Honda K. Yanai H. Takaoka A. Taniguchi T. Int. Immunity. 2005; 17: 1367-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). More importantly, the IRF-7-deficient mice (IRF-7−/−) were much more susceptible to viral infections compared with IRF-3-deficient mice (IRF-3−/−), with the increased viral susceptibility of the former well correlating with appreciable decreases in serum IFN levels. Another newly identified facet of IRF-7 is its critical role in a novel pathway involving the robust induction of type I IFNs. In this pathway, the Toll-like receptor molecule, exemplified by the Toll-like receptor 9 subfamily, subsequent to activation, recruits an adaptor protein MyD88. This adaptor protein specifically interacts with and activates IRF-7 (12Honda K. Taniguchi T. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 644-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 13Honda K. Yanai H. Mizutani T. Negishi H. Shimada N. Suzuki N. Ohba Y. Takaoka A. Yeh W.C. Taniguchi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15416-15421Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), resulting in type I IFN elicitation. The robust induction of type I IFN production by Toll-like receptor 9 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells is entirely dependent on IRF-7, with the MyD88-IRF-7 pathway governing the induction of CD8+ T-cell responses. Thus, all elements of type I IFN responses, whether the systemic production of IFN in innate antiviral immunity or the local action of IFN from plasmacytoid dendritic cells in adaptive immunity, are under control of IRF-7 (10Honda K. Yanai H. Negishi H. Asagiri M. Sato M. Mizutani T. Shimada N. Ohba Y. Takaoka A. Yoshida N. Taniguchi T. Nature. 2005; 434: 772-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar, 11Honda K. Yanai H. Takaoka A. Taniguchi T. Int. Immunity. 2005; 17: 1367-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Hence it is not surprising that many viruses specifically antagonize the effects of IRF-7 (14Wu L. Fossum E. Joo C.H. Inn K.S. Shin Y.C. Johannsen E. Hutt-Fletcher L.M. Hass J. Jung J.U. J.

Virol. 2005; 79: 10040-10052Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the case of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), our laboratory had earlier shown that a viral tegument (19Zhu F.X. Yuan Y. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4221-4230Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and an immediate-early (IE) (20Zhu F.X. Cusano T. Yuan Y. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5556-5567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) protein, ORF45, inhibits both the phosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of IRF-7 (21Zhu F.X. King S.M. Smith E.J. Levy D.E. Yuan Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5573-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), both of which constitute the pivotal steps in its activation. In a more recent study, we further showed that through targeting IRF-7, ORF45 effectively antagonizes the host antiviral responses, thereby helping the virus to establish a successful primary infection of cells (22Zhu F.X. Sathish N. Yuan Y. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e10573Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus based on these significant findings, we were prompted to understand the mechanism underlying inactivation of IRF-7 by ORF45. Toward this, we attempted to map the domain(s) on IRF-7 specifically binding with ORF45. Our result indicated that KSHV ORF45 specifically bound to a region on IRF-7 spanning aa 305–466. This region has been earlier identified as an inhibitory domain (ID) (23Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34320-34327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Additional domains across the entire length of the protein include (i) an amino-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) (aa 1–146); (ii) constitutive activation domain (CAD) (aa 151–246); (iii) virus activation domain (VAD) (aa 278–305); and (iv) a second transactivation component localized to the C-terminal, called the signal response domain (SRD) (aa 468–503) (23Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34320-34327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Among these different domains, it has been hypothesized that in the absence of a virus signal, the ID through intramolecular interactions maintains IRF-7 as a “closed” structure efficiently masking the N-terminal DBD and transactivation domains and the C-terminal signal response domains, thereby preventing the downstream activation of IRF-7 (4Zhang L. Pagano J.S. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 23Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. J. Biol.

A similar function of the ID has also been suggested for other IRFs including IRF-3 (27Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 28Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 29Qin B.Y. Liu C.

Biol. 2002; 22: 5721-5740Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The structural features of the ID region of IRF-7 has thus far remained elusive due to the absence of a known crystal structure for this protein. Subsequent to the finding that KSHV ORF45 interacts with the IRF-7 ID, combined with the possibility that ID critically controls the activation of IRF-7, motivated us to gain possible insights into this interesting region. By using mutagenesis analyses, combined with a molecular modeling approach, we identified distinct areas within the IRF-7 ID, enriched with hydrophobic amino acids, which vitally contributed to maintaining the IRF-7 molecule in closed conformation controlling the switch to an active form in response to viral infection. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. The prey plasmids for the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay consisted of (i) PCR amplified full-length IRF-7 cloned into the pACT2 vector (pACT2-IRF-7) in-frame with the GAL4 activation domain (AD) of the vector (Table 1); (ii) PCR amplified different truncation segments of IRF-7 cloned into the pACT2 vector (Table 1); (iii) deletion mutants of IRF-7 (ID1–ID10 with sequential amino acid deletions across the IRF-7 ID; Table 1) in the pACT2 vector, generated with a PCR-based mutagenesis system, ExSite (Stratagene) using a pair of phosphorylated oligonucleotides in opposite directions employing the pACT2-IRF-7 as the template; and (iv) PCR amplified IRF-7 exons (1–10) cloned into the pACT2 vector (Table 1). The bait plasmid was comprised of either the full-length KSHV ORF45 sequence or the IRF-7 ID sequence (aa 283–466) cloned into the pAS2-1 vector in-frame with the GAL4 DBD of the vector (Table 1).TABLE 1Characteristics of plasmids employed in different assays in this studyVector or plasmidConstructCharacteristicsYeast two-hybridPrey plasmidsIRF-7 full-lengthpACT2-IRF-7IRF-7 full-length (aa

Open table in a new tab The IRF-7 expressing plasmids for the co-immunoprecipitation assay consisted of (i) the full-length IRF-7 cloned into a pCMV-2-Flag expression vector designated as the pCMV-2-Flag-IRF-7 (Table 1) or (ii) different deletion mutants of IRF-7 (ID1–ID10 with sequential amino acid deletions across the IRF-7 ID; Table 1) constructed as earlier described employing the PCR-based mutagenesis system with pCMV-2-Flag-IRF-7 as the template. The KSHV ORF45 expressing plasmid, pCR3.1-ORF45, was constructed by cloning the entire ORF45 sequence into the pCR3.1 vector (Table 1). Interaction abilities of (i) IRF-7 full-length and the respective truncation/deletion “prey” plasmids (Table 1) with KSHV ORF45 “bait” plasmid or (ii) IRF-7 exon (1–10) prey plasmids (Table 1) with IRF-7 ID bait plasmid were tested by an Y2H analysis, performed with the Matchmaker system (Clontech). Yeast strain Y190 was co-transformed with the respective prey and bait plasmids using lithium acetate. Yeast transformants positive for the prey-bait interaction were selected on plates lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine titrated against increasing concentrations (10–50 mm) of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) and subsequently assayed for β-galactosidase activity using the standard colony-filter assay as described earlier (33Rozen R. Sathish N. Li Y. Yuan Y. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 4742-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Thus interactions between the prey and bait were scored as positive only if there was activation of both the reporter genes, HIS3 (growth on 3-AT incorporated plates lacking histidine) and LacZ (positive β-galactosidase assay). Subconfluent monolayers of HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with either the pCMV-2-Flag-IRF-7 (full-length) or the respective pCMV-2-Flag-IRF-7 deletion mutants (ID1–ID10) (Table 1), along with the ORF45 expressing plasmid (pCR3.1-ORF45) by the calcium-phosphate transfection method. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold PBS followed by lysis with ice-cold lysis buffer (33Rozen R. Sathish N. Li Y. Yuan Y. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 4742-4750Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cell lysates thus prepared were homogenized and clarified by high-speed centrifugation at 4 °C and subjected to an immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG M2-affinity gel (Sigma). Immunoprecipitated complexes were thoroughly washed with cold lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, boiled for 10 min, and loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen), and subsequently immunoblotted with a rabbit polyclonal anti-ORF45 antibody to detect the presence of co-precipitating ORF45. The promoter sequences of human IFNA1 (−140 to +9) and IFNB (−280 to +20) were cloned into the pGL3-basic vector (Promega). Subconfluent HEK 293T cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with 20 ng of pRL-TK reporter (Renilla luciferase as an internal control), 200 ng of pGL-3 reporter (firefly luciferase, experimental reporter), and 40 ng of IRF-7 expressing plasmid (IRF-7 full-length or the IRF-7 ID deletion mutants, ID1–ID20, cloned into a pCMV-2-FLAG vector; Table 1) employing the Qiagen Effectene transfection kit. At 8 h post-transfection, 80 hemagglutinin units (HA) of Sendai virus were added to one set of transfected cells. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cell lysates were collected and a luciferase assay was performed with the Dual-luciferase assay kit from Promega (Madison, WI). The full-length and the different IRF-7 ID deletion mutants, ID10–ID20, cloned into a pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech) (Table 1) that allows for expression of these proteins as fusions to the C terminus of EGFP were constructed. HEK 293T cells grown on coverslips were transfected with the above plasmids employing the Qiagen Effectene transfection kit. For virus infection, the transfected cells were challenged with Sendai virus (80 hemagglutinin units/ml) at 16 h post-transfection. Twelve hours post-infection, both the uninfected and the virus-infected cells were washed with PBS and subsequently fixed. The coverslips were mounted onto slides and examined under a confocal microscope (Nikon) and images were processed with a LaserSharp 2000 software. The x-ray crystal structure of IRF-3 (Protein Data Bank 1J2F) was obtained from the Protein Data Bank at the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics. The C-terminal section of the B chain (residues 189–422) served as the structure template. The sequence of IRF-7 (residues 281–503) was aligned to the IRF-3 structure by sequence similarity, and the coordinates of homologous amino acids were transferred from IRF-3 to IRF-7 using the Homology module of Insight II (Accelrys). The coordinates of unassigned residues of IRF-7 were estimated by standard interpolation methods. The final structure was then subjected to energy minimization using the Discover module of Insight II. Earlier findings from our laboratory revealed that KSHV ORF45 inhibited IRF-7 activation (21Zhu F.X. King S.M. Smith E.J. Levy D.E. Yuan Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 5573-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) thus effectively antagonizing the host antiviral immune responses, helping to establish a successful primary viral infection (22Zhu F.X. Sathish N. Yuan Y. PLoS One. 2010; 5: e10573Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus toward further comprehending the interaction dynamics between IRF-7 and ORF45, we attempted to map the region(s) on IRF-7 interacting with ORF45. The full-length IRF-7 and a series of truncation mutants across the entire length of the protein (Fig. 1) cloned into the pACT2 vector (prey) were co-transformed along with full-length ORF45 in pAS2-1 vector (bait) into yeast strain Y190. This allowed for the simultaneous expression of both the prey and bait proteins within the yeast cells. Potential yeast transformants positive for prey-bait interactions were selected based on their His+LacZ+ phenotype as indicated by their ability to grow on plates incorporated with 3-AT but lacking histidine (His+) with concomitant β-galactosidase (LacZ) activity. The Y2H results indicated that full-length IRF-7 and mutants with successive truncations of the N terminus up to amino acid 283 (inclusive of mutants spanning amino acids 77–503, 92–503, 181–503, 255–503, and 283–503) were able to interact with KSHV ORF45 (Fig. 1) with comparable intensities (data not shown). However, any further truncation of the N terminus of IRF-7 beyond amino acid 283 failed to associate with ORF45 as seen with the mutant encompassing aa 305–503 (Fig. 1). On the other hand, a series of truncations from the C terminus of IRF-7 up to amino acid 466 (mutants spanning amino acids 283–490, 283–466) did not seem to affect the ability of IRF-7 to bind with ORF45. Binding was totally lost upon C-terminal truncations beyond amino acid 466 as exemplified by the mutant spanning IRF-7 aa 283–452 (Fig. 1). A fragment of IRF-7 encompassing aa 283–466 completely retained the ability to associate with ORF45 (Fig. 1). Taken together the Y2H study clearly indicated that KSHV ORF45 specifically binds to a region on IRF-7 encompassing aa 283–466. After mapping the ORF45-binding region on IRF-7 to the stretch spanning aa 283–466, we wanted to further dissect this region to investigate if ORF45 bound to designated stretches of amino acids within this region. We constructed a series of small deletion mutants of IRF-7, designated as mutants ID1–ID10, across the entire region spanning aa 283–466 as illustrated in Fig. 2A. The respective deletion mutants or the full-length IRF-7 that constituted the prey array were cotransformed into yeast cells along with the bait (ORF45 in pAS2–1 vector). His+LacZ+ yeast transformants were subsequently selected as earlier described. In addition to its interaction with the full-length IRF-7, KSHV ORF45 also interacted with the IRF-7 deletion mutant ID1, which had a deletion of an amino acid stretch from 283 to 304 (Fig. 2A). However, ORF45 failed to interact with deletion mutant ID10, which completely lacked the IRF-7 aa stretch 283–466 and deletion mutants ID2–ID9, which harbored deletions of consecutive 20-amino acid stretches starting from the N terminus at aa 305 (Fig. 2A). Thus the Y2H result clearly indicated that ORF45 recognizes the entire sequence of IRF-7 within the stretch spanning amino acids 305–466. To confirm these Y2H findings, we proceeded with a co-immunoprecipitation assay. The full-length IRF-7 or the respective IRF-7 deletion mutants, ID1–ID10, cloned into a FLAG-tagged expression vector were co-transfected along with an ORF45 expression vector (pCR3.1-ORF45) into subconfluent monolayers of HEK 293T cells. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were lysed and the optimal and stable expression of both the co-transfected protein pairs was confirmed by immunoblotting employing specific anti-FLAG (Fig. 2B) and anti-ORF45 polyclonal antibodies, respectively (data not shown). Cell lysates immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody-agarose affinity gel (Sigma) were subjected to Western blot to detect the presence of co-precipitating ORF45 employing a specific polyclonal antibody toward it. ORF45 in addition to being immunoprecipitated with full-length IRF-7 was also efficiently precipitated with the IRF-7 mutant ID1 (aa Δ283–304) (Fig. 2B). However, ORF45 failed to interact with all the other deletion mutants inclusive of mutant ID10 that completely lacked the stretch spanning aa 2"

They will open when bacteria are subjected to rapid osmotic down shock. MscS is a bacterial mechanosensitive channel of small conductance. It is a heptameric membrane protein whose transmembrane part, including the gate and its kinetics, has been well characterized. MscS has a large cytoplasmic domain of a cage-like shape that changes its conformation upon gating, but its involvement in gating is not understood. We screened MscS for mutations that cause potassium leak in Escherichia coli strains deficient in potassium transport systems. We did a phenotypic analysis of single and multiple mutants and recorded the single channel activities of some of them. After these analyses, we attributed the effects of a number of mutations to particular functional states of the channel. Our screen revealed that MscS leaks potassium in a desensitized and in an inactivated state. It also appeared that the lower part of TM3 (transmembrane, pore-forming helix) and the cytoplasmic β domain are tightly packed in the inactivated state but are dissociated in the open state. We attribute the TM3-β interaction to stabilization of the inactivated state in MscS and to the control of tight closure of its membrane pore.

MscS opens when activated directly by membrane stretch, and the same mechanism activates also MscL, another Escherichia coli MS channel that has higher threshold and bigger conductance than MscS. When open, both channels will jettison osmolytes protecting the bacteria against severe osmotic down shock (1Levina N. Tötemeyer S. Stokes N.R. Louis P. Jones M.A. Booth I.R.

MscS is a homo-heptamer, and each subunit consists of three membrane-spanning helices (TM1, TM2, and TM3) and a large cytoplasmic domain (Fig. 1A) (2Bass R.B. Strop P. Barclay M. Rees D.C.

J. 2009; 97: 1048-1057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The emerging model is that TM3, the channel pore-lining helix, buckles and straightens at glycines 113 and 121. This action happens during transitions between the closed, open, desensitized, and inactivated states (11Akitake B. Anishkin A. Liu N. Sukharev S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Mutation of these glycines to alanines (in G113A/G121A mutant) allows the channel to open but jams it in the open state even after pressure release (11Akitake B. Anishkin A. Liu N. Sukharev S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A few experimental tests have been conducted to support the model; however, the conclusions drawn from them were restricted to the transmembrane part of the channel. The MscS large cytoplasmic chamber was previously shown to change its conformation upon gating (19Grajkowski W. Kubalski A. Koprowski P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 3050-3059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Machiyama H. Tatsumi H. Sokabe M. Biophys.

Chem. 2003; 278: 32246-32250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); however, it is not understood nor is it modeled how this cage-like shaped domain is involved in gating. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of MscS gating, an approach that provides a broader search in a model-independent manner is required.Until now, bacterial MS channels have been functionally characterized in vivo mostly by isolation of so-called “gain-of-function” (GOF) and “loss-of-function” (LOF) mutants. GOF mutants inhibited cell growth because they opened at a lower threshold of activation. On the other hand, LOF mutants were less effective in protecting cells against osmotic down shocks because of impaired opening. Multiple mutants of MscL exhibiting GOF phenotype have been isolated from the random mutant library (24Ou X. Blount P. Hoffman R.J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 11471-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The isolation was possible by screening for clones that block bacterial growth when overexpressed. This allowed mapping the channel gate even before its crystal structure was known. Similar approaches applied to MscS have been less successful because only one GOF mutant was found (V40D) (25Okada K. Moe P.C. Blount P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27682-27688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Analysis of LOF mutants of MscL isolated through random and scanning mutagenesis with mutations in the periplasmic rim of its funnel (26Yoshimura K. Nomura T. Sokabe M. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 2113-2120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) indicated the importance of the lipid-protein interaction. Lipid-protein interactions have been also invoked as crucial in channel function in the study in which externally exposed amino acids from TM1/2 of MscS were mutated to arginines. In this study, few LOF mutants were identified (27Nomura T. Sokabe M. Yoshimura K. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 2874-2881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar).We used a genetic complementation approach in Escherichia coli strains deficient in potassium transport systems (e.g. LB2003 or TK2446). These strains cannot grow on a media with low (1–10 mm) potassium (28Dosch D.C. Helmer G.L. Sutton S.H. Salvacion F.F. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 687-696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but expression of potassium channels or transporters can restore their growth (29Parfenova L.V. Crane B.M. Rothberg B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21131-21138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This strategy was successful for isolation of potassium channels and transporters (30Sun S. Gan J.H. Paynter J.J. Tucker S.J. Physiol. Genomics. 2006; 26: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) as well as the mutations that activate potassium channels (31Irizarry S.N. Kutluay E. Drews G. Hart S.J. Heginbotham L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13653-13662Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 32Paynter J.J. Sarkies P. Andres-Enguix I. Tucker S.J. Channels. 2008; 2: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A similar approach but utilizing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae K+ transport-deficient mutant was also used to study functional substitutions in the Kir2.1 inwardly rectifying potassium channel (33Minor Jr., D.L. Masseling S.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cell. 1999; 96: 879-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The assay also worked for detecting nonphysiological pathways of potassium influx and for isolation of potassium-conducting mutants of transport proteins that are not potassium-selective. In this way single genomic mutants of MscL and ProP were isolated (34Buurman E.T. McLaggan D. Naprstek J. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4238-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and seven mutants of MscK, a MscS paralog, were tested (35Li C. Edwards M.D. Jeong H. Jeong H. Roth J. Booth I.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 64: 560-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This was possible due to the high inward potassium electrochemical gradient, so any “leaky” protein could provide a route for potassium influx. This strategy may therefore result in isolation of mutants with a variety of functional changes in protein. We have been able to isolate a plethora of mutations that cause MscS to leak potassium. After phenotypic analysis, we have also been able to assign the role of several of them to the particular functional state of the channel.Our data presented here indicate the following: (i) the lower part of TM3 (TM3b) and the β domain are tightly packed in the closed and desensitized/inactivated states; (ii) they dissociate upon opening suggesting that MscS leaks potassium in the desensitized/inactivated state, and (iii) this supports the previous proposal that inactivation from the open state involves uncoupling of TM1/2 from TM3 and identifies residues important for the TM1/2-TM3 interaction. The list of mutants isolated in the screen provides mutant candidates for further detailed studies by means of electrophysiology, EPR, and crystallography.RESULTSWe used a genetic complementation approach in the E. coli strains deficient in potassium transport (TK2446 and LB2003), which cannot grow on a media with low potassium concentration (28Dosch D.C. Helmer G.L. Sutton S.H. Salvacion F.F. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 687-696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their growth, however, could be restored by expression of an exogenous channel that allowed for an inwardly directed potassium flow (31Irizarry S.N. Kutluay E. Drews G. Hart S.J. Heginbotham L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13653-13662Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We constructed a random mutant library of MscS in the pTRC99A plasmid. This library was transformed into the E. coli TK2446 and LB2003 strains, and ∼107 clones were plated on low potassium. We isolated clones that grew on 1 and 3 mm potassium, with a low concentration of IPTG (10 and 50 μm) that produced a weak induction of protein expression. We opted for weak induction because we expected that some mutants might have a GOF phenotype. These mutants could inhibit growth if overproduced. We realized that there is an optimal level of channel activity required to rescue growth (32Paynter J.J. Sarkies P. Andres-Enguix I. Tucker S.J. Channels. 2008; 2: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and the level of protein expression should be much lower than that previously used for isolation of GOF mutants (24Ou X. Blount P. Hoffman R.J. Kung C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 11471-11475Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore, the screens were performed under low induction such that even potentially toxic mutations could be metabolically tolerated and retrieved. Our expectation was that leaky mutants, meaning channels that complement potassium uptake deficiency, would emerge from the screen.Catalog of the Mutants and Their Location on the MscS StructureWe isolated 77 unique mutants that grew on low potassium (supplemental Table S1). Among them were five single mutants, and the rest were the multiple ones bearing up to six mutations. Most of the mutations, mainly those with charged and to a lesser extent polar substitutions of hydrophobic amino acids, were found within TM1–3 helices of the channel (Fig. 1, B and C). The list of mutations (supplemental Table S2) clearly shows that mutants with mutations in TM3 were isolated most frequently. While analyzing the results of the screen, the question we are addressing is as follows. How does a single substitution of a particular amino acid contribute to the potassium leak? Because the majority of the mutants had multiple mutations, a straightforward answer would be difficult. In multiple mutants, one or more of the mutations could be responsible for the phenotype, although the others could be neutral. It is possible that multiple mutations contributed additively/synergistically to the potassium leak phenotype, or alternatively, the rate of mutagenesis was too high for isolation of single mutants. To narrow down these possibilities and determine which of the mutations is responsible for the phenotype, we selected 4 single and 14 multiple mutants (with 2–5 mutations each) for detailed analysis. We chose multiple mutants in such a way as to include mutations that were scattered over diverse regions of the channel except for mutations in 26 amino acids in the unresolved N-terminal part of MscS. The mutations were studied in single mutants that were isolated in the screen or constructed (Table 1) or as a combination of substitutions in double, triple, and quadruple mutants as found in multiple mutants isolated in the screen (supplemental Table S3). It yielded a set of 66 mutants for further analysis.TABLE 1Phenotypic analysis of the single mutant set Open table in a new tab Each mutant (in strain TK2446) was tested for growth in various potassium concentrations as follows: from 1 to 10 mm in 1 mm increments and in 15 mm with 50 μm IPTG to determine permeability for K+. An additional growth test in 115 mm potassium (nonlimiting concentration) with 1 or 2 mm IPTG was performed to identify mutants with impaired growth in these conditions. Those were recognized as exhibiting a GOF phenotype, which reflects increased channel opening at resting membrane tension. In addition, each mutant was tested in strain MJF465 (ΔmscKΔmscLΔmscS) for survival of osmotic down shock. We used two protocols in the tests performed as follows: one under low expression (where there was no exogenous induction, and expression was due to promoter leak) and the other under high expression (induction by 1 mm IPTG). These survival tests enabled us to identify mutations that interfered with gating of the channel and resulted in channels that lost the ability to protect the cell from down shocks (LOF phenotype). Growth and survival tests allowed for precise detection of how a particular mutation may be involved in potassium leak (Table 1, supplemental Table S3, and supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). GOF and LOF phenotypes can give additional information on the role and involvement of particular amino acids during MscS gating. All collected data on the set of 66 mutants are included in supplemental Table S3.To be clear and concise, we will present and discuss in detail our observations on all 35 single mutants taken from the set of 66 mutants. This group of mutants includes 31 mutants that we constructed and 4 isolated directly in the screen. To gain a better insight into the correlation between location of mutation and its impact on the channel behavior, we mapped the mutations on the MscS high resolution crystal structure (Fig. 2, A–C). We also grouped single mutants according to their associated GOF or LOF phenotype. In addition, we recognized a group of single mutants with “no GOF, no LOF” phenotype, which included mutants with channels leaking potassium but whose growth and osmotic down shock survival remained unchanged.FIGURE 2Localization of mutations from the potassium-leaking single mutants within the MscS structure (Protein Data Bank code 2oau) in reference to their associated phenotypes such as cell growth and contribution to down shock protection.

Among them there were 7 GOF mutants (3 were described earlier (15Edwards M.D. Li Y. Kim S. Miller S. Bartlett W. Black S. Dennison S. Iscla I. Blount P. Bowie J.U. Booth I.R. Nat. Struct. Mol.

Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar)).Mutants with Substitutions in the Pore-facing Surface of TM3a Exhibit GOF PhenotypeThe screen revealed that polar substitutions of hydrophobic amino acids clustered in the upper pore-exposed part of TM3a resulted in GOF phenotype. These mutations include I97N, A98S, and A101S/A101D (Table 1 and Fig. 2A). The latter one was found only in multiple mutants and resulted in an extremely strong GOF phenotype, which prevented its analysis as a single mutation (supplemental Tables S1–S3). There was an A94D mutation also found in this cluster; however, it did not evoke GOF (Table 1). Serine substitutions of alanines 94 and 98 were introduced previously and shown to lower the threshold of the MscS activation (15Edwards M.D. Li Y. Kim S. Miller S. Bartlett W. Black S. Dennison S. Iscla I. Blount P. Bowie J.U. Booth I.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). G104S and A106T mutants with mutations in the middle part of the pore-exposed surface of TM3a did not exhibit any obvious growth phenotype. They grew only on a very high potassium concentration (Table 1). The gate mutations (L109P/L109Q) were isolated in multiple mutants; however, we were unable to analyze them as single mutants due to extreme GOF phenotype.Based on previous findings and the results presented here, we think that, in general, this category of mutations pinpoints regions and residues affecting the channel opening. As a consequence, the channels carrying mutations in the pore region have a lower threshold of opening and a higher probability of opening in vivo than the wild type MscS.Mutations at the TM1/2-TM3 Interface Lead to LOF PhenotypeWe found mutants leaking potassium but showing LOF in osmotic shock experiments. The mutations leading to this phenotype were as follows: V65D, A85T, L86N, and G90A on TM2; V96D on TM3a; and L115Q, A119D, and G121D on TM3b (Fig. 2B). A85T does not complement potassium transport deficiency in concentrations up to 15 mm [K+] (Table 1) but dramatically enhances potassium leak in the double mutant A85T/G121D (supplemental Table S3).Interestingly, all but one of these mutations point toward the TM1/TM2-TM3 interface, which is in contrast to GOF mutations that point toward the pore (Fig. 2C). The only LOF-inducing single mutation found beyond this interface was N167Y/N167I localized in the β domain (Fig. 2B). The mutations in TM1/2 and TM3 form two clusters (Fig. 2B). One (upper) cluster is found in the helical turn region around Gly-90, which is a hinge for TM1/2 swinging motion upon the channel transition between open and inactivated states (2Bass R.B. Strop P. Barclay M. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 298: 1582-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The mutation G90S might decrease hinge flexibility and/or increase hinge angle leading to the detaching of the TM1/2 paddle from the TM3 barrel. This possibility would lead to an idea that the resting conformation of mutated channels may resemble an inactivated state of the wild type channel. The other mutations in this region are V96D, A85T, and L86N. Mutations in the 85 and 86 positions were previously found to result in LOF phenotype, and this was interpreted as an effect of improper lipid-protein interaction (27Nomura T. Sokabe M. Yoshimura K. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 2874-2881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our data presented in this paper and other recently published results (14Belyy V. Anishkin A. Kamaraju K. Liu N. Sukharev S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) suggest that in potassium-leaking mutants, LOF phenotype is rather an effect of broken or loosened protein-protein interactions.The lower cluster of mutations is located in the crevice between the TM1/2 paddle and the outer (facing the paddle) surface of TM3b (Fig. 2B) and includes V65D on TM2 as well as L115Q and A119D on TM3b. These two structures interact in a modeled MscS closed conformation (12Anishkin A. Akitake B. Sukharev S. Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 1252-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and form a hydrophobic contact between Val-65, Phe-68, and Leu-69 on TM2 and Leu-111 and Leu-115 on TM3 (38Anishkin A. Sukharev S. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 19153-19157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The interaction of the TM1/2 paddle and TM3 is also critical for force transmission from the membrane to the gate and activation of the channel (14Belyy V. Anishkin A. Kamaraju K. Liu N. Sukharev S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Any perturbation of the contact between interacting residues leads in fact to the inactivated conformation in which the channel is pressure-insensitive (14Belyy V. Anishkin A. Kamaraju K. Liu N. Sukharev S. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).To support the notion that channels with this class of mutations (leaking potassium and showing LOF) reside in vivo in an inactivated state, we chose V65D, L115Q, and A119D mutants for the electrophysiological experiments. We detected channel activity of the V65D mutant in the strain MJF465; however, the number of channels was significantly lower than in the case of the wild type MscS expressed under the same conditions (0–5 V65D channels versus 50–100 wild type channels), and the channel showed fast inactivating, flickery behavior indicating a tendency for closure (supplemental Fig. S3). While testing the L115Q mutant in the MJF465 strain (ΔmscKΔmscLΔmscS), we were unable to detect any mechanosensitive channel activity that could be attributed to MscS channels (data not shown). This observation is consistent with a very strong LOF phenotype (Table 1) that may be an effect of a persistent inactivation of the channel. The L115Q mutant, similarly to A119D, was very proficient in potassium leak (growth on 1 mm K+), but unlike A119D, it was completely deficient in protection against osmotic down shocks (Table 1). The mutant A119D in TM2 showed very similar activities to those recorded from V65D when expressed in the strain MJF465 (supplemental Fig. S3). To measure a relative threshold of channel activation, A119D was expressed in the strain MJF429 (ΔmscKΔmscS). Its activities (if any) overlapped with the activities of MscL whose threshold of activation is significantly higher than that of the wild type MscS (data not shown). This indicates that the mutant channel has a higher activation threshold and points to impaired force transmission between the TM1/2 paddle and the TM3 gate. The level of mechanosensitive activity of the LOF mutants correlates with the severity of LOF phenotype but not with the level of MscS expression. The level of expression of the L115Q mutant is comparable with the level of expression of A119D, but A119D shows channel activity and L115Q does not (supplemental Fig. S4).The mutants found in this screen confirm recent findings that serine substitutions of the residues in the TM1/2-TM3 crevices (Val-65, Phe-68, Leu-111, and Leu-115) result in channels exhibiting partial LOF phenotype (with L115S giving the strongest LOF phenotype), are inactivated without opening (silent inactivation), and show high thresholds of activation, fast inactivation, and flickery behavior (14Bel"
https://openalex.org/W1975596982,"Neurotransmitter release is triggered by Ca2+ binding to a low affinity Ca2+ sensor, mostly synaptotagmin-1, which catalyzes SNARE-mediated synaptic vesicle fusion. Tomosyn negatively regulates Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release by sequestering target SNAREs through the C-terminal VAMP-like domain. In addition to the C terminus, the N-terminal WD40 repeats of tomosyn also have potent inhibitory activity toward Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release, although the molecular mechanism underlying this effect remains elusive. Here, we show that through its N-terminal WD40 repeats tomosyn directly binds to synaptotagmin-1 in a Ca2+-dependent manner. The N-terminal WD40 repeats impaired the activities of synaptotagmin-1 to promote SNARE complex-mediated membrane fusion and to bend the lipid bilayers. Decreased acetylcholine release from N-terminal WD40 repeat-microinjected superior cervical ganglion neurons was relieved by microinjection of the cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin-1. These results indicate that, upon direct binding, the N-terminal WD40 repeats negatively regulate the synaptotagmin-1-mediated step of Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release. Furthermore, we show that synaptotagmin-1 binding enhances the target SNARE-sequestering activity of tomosyn.

Neurotransmitter release arises from Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of synaptic vesicles (1Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1888) Google Scholar). At the presynaptic active zone, synaptic vesicles are docked beside Ca2+ channels and primed to become fusion-competent. Upon reaching presynaptic nerve terminals, action potentials open Ca2+ channels. The resulting Ca2+ influx triggers fusion of primed synaptic vesicles to the presynaptic plasma membrane. Exocytotic efficacy of synaptic vesicles is adequately controlled (1Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 509-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1888) Google Scholar, 2Südhof T.C.

The vesicle fusion process is catalyzed by three soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein (SNAP) receptors (SNAREs), syntaxin-1, SNAP-25, and VAMP2 (10Jahn R.

Syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 are localized within the presynaptic plasma membrane as target SNAREs (t-SNAREs), and VAMP2 resides in synaptic vesicles as a vesicular SNARE (v-SNARE). The three SNARE proteins are thought to assemble in a zipper-like fashion and form a stable SNARE complex. As a consequence, the synaptic vesicles and the presynaptic plasma membrane are pulled into close apposition, leading to mixing of the two lipid bilayers (10Jahn R. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol.

On the other hand, it is largely unknown how synaptotagmin-1 is adequately inactivated to control the exocytotic efficacy of synaptic vesicles.

Consistent with an inhibitory activity toward SNARE complex formation, the genetic ablation of tomosyn in mice and Caenorhabditis elegans leads to enhancement of neurotransmitter release (34Sakisaka T.

Sakisaka T. Mochida S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1113-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that tomosyn controls the exocytotic efficacy of synaptic vesicles. Paired pulse facilitation at mossy fiber synapses of hippocampi is decreased in the tomosyn-deficient mice (34Sakisaka T. Yamamoto Y. Mochida S. Nakamura M. Nishikawa K. Ishizaki H. Okamoto-Tanaka M. Miyoshi J. Fujiyoshi Y. Manabe T. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In response to repetitive presynaptic action potentials, tomosyn-overexpressing neurons show severe synaptic depression in contrast to the remarkable synaptic facilitation seen in control neurons (39Baba T. Sakisaka T. Mochida S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1113-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how tomosyn controls Ca2+-dependent exocytosis because the C-terminal VAMP-like domain sequesters t-SNAREs in a Ca2+-independent manner. The N-terminal WD40 repeats of tomosyn are also responsible for potent inhibition of neurotransmitter release. We have demonstrated that acetylcholine release from SCG neurons is potently inhibited by microinjecting a tomosyn fragment encompassing the N-terminal WD40 repeats (34Sakisaka T. Yamamoto Y. Mochida S. Nakamura M. Nishikawa K. Ishizaki H. Okamoto-Tanaka M. Miyoshi J. Fujiyoshi Y. Manabe T. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that catecholamine secretion is potently inhibited in chromaffin cells by overexpressing the N-terminal WD40 repeats of tomosyn (40Yizhar O. Lipstein N. Gladycheva S.E. Matti U. Ernst S.A. Rettig J. Stuenkel E.L. Ashery U. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 604-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the inhibitory activity of the N-terminal WD40 repeats in chromaffin cells was dependent on Ca2+ concentration (40Yizhar O. Lipstein N. Gladycheva S.E. Matti U. Ernst S.A. Rettig J. Stuenkel E.L. Ashery U. J. Neurochem. 2007; 103: 604-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 41Yizhar O. Matti U. Melamed R. Hagalili Y. Bruns D. Rettig J. Ashery U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 2578-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Similarly, we reported that the inhibitory activity of tomosyn in SCG neurons is influenced by Ca2+ concentration (39Baba T. Sakisaka T. Mochida S. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 1113-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although we have shown that tomosyn oligomerizes the SNARE complex through its N-terminal WD40 repeats (34Sakisaka T. Yamamoto Y. Mochida S. Nakamura M. Nishikawa K. Ishizaki H. Okamoto-Tanaka M. Miyoshi J. Fujiyoshi Y. Manabe T. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 323-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), this does not account for the Ca2+-dependent inhibitory activity of the N-terminal WD40 repeats because the oligomerization takes place in a Ca2+-independent manner. Therefore, the N-terminal WD40 repeats must functionally interact with a Ca2+-responsive protein(s) involved in the regulation of synaptic vesicle fusion. In C. elegans, tomosyn associates with synaptic vesicles through the N-terminal WD40 repeats (38McEwen J.M. Madison J.M. Dybbs M. Kaplan J.M. Neuron. 2006; 51: 303-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that the N-terminal WD40 repeats may negatively regulate the function of synaptic vesicles. However, the binding partner(s) on synaptic vesicles for the N-terminal WD40 repeats remains unknown. To understand the molecular mechanism by which tomosyn controls neurotransmitter release, it is crucial to elucidate how the N-terminal WD40 repeats inhibit neurotransmitter release. In this study, we demonstrate that tomosyn directly binds to synaptotagmin-1 through the N-terminal WD40 repeats, in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and impairs synaptotagmin-1 catalysis. These results indicate that tomosyn negatively regulates the synaptotagmin-1-mediated step of Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release through the N-terminal WD40 repeats. We also demonstrate that this binding positively regulates the activity of the C-terminal VAMP-like domain of tomosyn to form the tomosyn-SNARE complex. These results raise the possibility that the interplay between tomosyn and synaptotagmin-1 underlies the inhibitory control of Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release. The MBP-fused full-length tomosyn-1 (amino acids 1–1116) (MBP-tomosyn) and the MBP-fused large N-terminal fragment of tomosyn-1 (amino acids 1–949) (MBP-tomosyn-N) were expressed in Sf21 cells and purified as described previously (34Sakisaka T.

Synaptosomes were isolated from rat brains as described previously (42Mizoguchi A. Ueda T. Ikeda K. Shiku H. Mizoguti H. Takai Y. Brain. Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1989; 5: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One milligram of the synaptosomes was solubilized with Buffer A containing 10 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1.3 mm CaCl2, and 1% (w/v) Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 60 min followed by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with an anti-tomosyn pAb immobilized on protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 60 min. The immobilized antibodies were washed with Buffer A three times, and the bound proteins were solubilized in SDS sample buffer with boiling. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with an anti-tomosyn pAb, an anti-synaptotagmin-1 mAb, and an anti-VAMP2 mAb. ΔTM-synaptotagmin-1 (3400 pmol) was incubated with 80 pmol of MBP-tomosyn or MBP immobilized on 20 μl of amylose beads in Buffer B containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 0.5% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C for 5 h. After the beads had been extensively washed with Buffer B three times, the bound proteins were eluted in the SDS sample buffer with boiling. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by CBB staining. ΔTM-synaptotagmin-1 (2000 pmol) was incubated with 100 pmol of MBP-tomosyn-N, MBP-tomosyn-C, or MBP immobilized on 20 μl of amylose beads in 1 ml of Buffer B or 1 ml of Buffer C containing 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5% (w/v) Nonidet P-40 at 4 °C overnight. After the beads had been extensively washed with Buffer B or Buffer C three times, the bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer with boiling. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by CBB staining. To obtain the Kd value for the binding of synaptotagmin-1 to N-terminal WD40 repeats, ΔTM-synaptotagmin-1 was titrated in Buffer C, and the amounts of bound and free ΔTM-synaptotagmin-1 were quantified and plotted. The Kd value was calculated by Scatchard analysis. For analysis of the binding of syntaxin-1 or SNAP-25 to the N-terminal WD40 repeats of tomosyn, various concentrations of syntaxin-1-ΔTM or SNAP-25 were incubated with 100 pmol of MBP-tomosyn-N immobilized on 20 μl of amylose beads in 1 ml of Buffer C at 4 °C overnight. After the beads had been extensively washed with Buffer C three times, the bound proteins were eluted in the SDS sample buffer with boiling. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by CBB staining or immunoblotting with an anti-syntaxin-1 mAb or an anti-SNAP-25 mAb. The amounts of bound and free syntaxin-1-ΔTM or SNAP-25 were quantified and plotted. The Kd values were calculated by Scatchard analysis. For analysis of the binding of syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 to full-length tomosyn, equal concentrations of syntaxin-1-ΔTM and SNAP-25 were incubated with 100 pmol of MBP-tomosyn immobilized on 20 μl of amylose beads at various concentrations in 1 ml of Buffer C at 4 °C overnight. The bound proteins were eluted in the same manner as described above, and the Kd value was calculated. To compare the binding of t-SNAREs to tomosyn and the binding of synaptotagmin-1 to tomosyn, equal concentrations of syntaxin-1-ΔTM, SNAP-25, and ΔTM-synaptotagmin-1 were incubated with 100 pmol of MBP-tomosyn immobilized on 20 μl of amylose beads at various concentrations in 1 ml of Buffer C at 4 °C overnight, and the bound proteins were eluted in the same manner as described above. All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, and the SNARE-bearing liposomes were prepared as reported previously with a slight modification (13Weber T. Zemelman B.V. McNew J.A. Westermann B. Gmachl M. Parlati F. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 759-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2021) Google Scholar). Briefly, for preparation of t-SNARE vesicles, 150 μl of a 10 mm lipid mixture composed of 85 mol % 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 15 mol % 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (DOPS) dissolved in chloroform was dried down in 10 × 75-mm test tubes by a gentle stream of N2 gas, and any remaining traces of chloroform were then removed under vacuum for more than 30 min. The lipid films were dissolved in 500 μl of liposome buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 0.8% (w/v) n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside) containing 0.8 mg/ml syntaxin-1 and 0.8 mg/ml SNAP-25 for the t-SNARE vesicles by gentle agitation for 15 min at room temperature (RT). For preparation of fluorescently labeled v-SNARE vesicles, 100 μl of a 3 mm lipid mixture composed of 82 mol % POPC, 15 mol % DOPS, 1.5 mol % N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiaziole-4-yl)-1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (NBD-DPPE), and 1.5 mol % N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phophoethanolamine (rhodamine-DPPE) dissolved in chloroform was dried in 10 × 75-mm test tubes in the same manner as described above. The lipid film was dissolved in 100 μl of liposome buffer B (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 1% (w/v) n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside) containing 0.4 mg/ml VAMP2 by gentle agitation for 15 min at RT. The samples were diluted 3-fold with reconstitution buffer (25 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, and 1 mm DTT) so that the level of n-octyl β-d-glucopyranoside was below its critical micellar concentration. Then the samples were dialyzed against 4 liters of reconstitution buffer supplemented with 4 g of Biobeads SM-2 (Bio-Rad) using 7-kDa cutoff membranes at RT for 1 h. The dialysis was continued at 4 °C overnight with no buffer change. The dialysates were mixed with equal volumes of 80% (w/v) Nycodenz (Sigma) dissolved in reconstitution buffer. For the t-SNARE vesicles, 1.3 ml of the sample was overlaid with 1 ml of 30% (w/v) Nycodenz dissolved in reconstitution buffer followed by 1 ml of reconstitution buffer lacking glycerol. For the v-SNARE vesicles, 700 μl of the sample was overlaid with 1 ml of 30% (w/v) Nycodenz dissolved in reconstitution buffer followed by 1.5 ml of reconstitution buffer lacking glycerol. The samples were centrifuged at 200,000 × g at 4 °C for 4 h. The vesicles were harvested from the 0/30% Nycodenz interface. ΔTM-synaptotagmin-1 (120 pmol), MBP-tomosyn-N (120 pmol), MBP-tomosyn-C (120 pmol), the mixture of ΔTM-synaptotagmin-1 (120 pmol) and MBP-tomosyn-N (120 pmol), and the mixture of ΔTM-synaptotagmin-1 (120 pmol) and MBP-tomosyn-C (120 pmol) were incubated in 30 μl of reconstitution buffer supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 at 4 °C for 1 h, respectively. Then the t-SNARE vesicles, within which 60 pmol of each of t-SNAREs was embedded, were added to each sample and incubated in 50 μl of reconstitution buffer supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 at 4 °C for 1 h. As positive and negative controls, the t-SNARE vesicles and liposomes with no t-SNARE proteins (control vesicles) were simply incubated in 50 μl of reconstitution buffer supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 at 4 °C for 1 h, respectively. The samples were mixed with 8 μl of fluorescently labeled v-SNARE vesicles on ice, and immediately 50 μl of each of the samples was placed in a 96-well plate (Nunc) on an ice-cold metal block followed by overlaying with 50 μl of mineral oil (Sigma). The increase in NBD fluorescence upon lipid mixing was monitored at 1-min intervals for 60 min at 37 °C using a fluorometer (Fluoroskan Ascent FL, Thermo Scientific) with the filters set at 460 (excitation) and 538 nm (emission). Then 10 μl of 2.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 was added to terminate the fusion reactions and dequench the NBD fluorescence. To normalize the fusion-dependent fluorescence, the lowest NBD fluorescent signals and the maximum signals after Triton X-100 addition were set to 0 and 100% fluorescence, respectively. Brain lipid extract (Folch fraction I) was dried and resuspended at 1 mg/ml in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, and 100 mm KCl. Folch liposomes were produced by sonication. ΔTM-synaptotagmin-1 (9 μm), MBP-tomosyn-N (9 μm), and a mixture of ΔTM-synaptotagmin-1 (9 μm) and MBP-tomosyn-N (9 μm) were incubated in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm DTT at 4 °C for 3 h, respectively. Folch liposomes (0.2 mg/ml) were added to each sample and incubated at RT for 30 min. For the control reaction, 0.2 mg/ml Folch liposomes were simply suspended in buffer. The samples were loaded on a carbon-coated grid (glow-discharged) and stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Negatively stained samples were viewed on an H-7650 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) operated at 80 kV, and images were recorded at a nominal magnification of 20,000 using a 1024 × 1024 charge-coupled device camera (Tietz Video and Image Processing Systems, Gauting, Germany). Postnatal day 7 Wistar ST rats were decapitated under diethyl ether anesthesia according to the guidelines of the Physiological Society of Japan. Isolated SCG neurons were maintained in culture for 5–6 weeks as described (43Mochida S. Nonomura Y. Kobayashi H. Microsc. Res.

In brief, SCGs were dissected, desheathed, and incubated with collagenase (0.5 mg/ml; Worthington) in L-15 (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 10 min.

Integration of genomic data and construction of functional gene networks may provide additional insights into complex diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).We analyzed gene expression microarray data of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) from 20 SLE patients (11 with active disease) and 10 controls. Gene networks were constructed using the bioinformatic tool Ingenuity Gene Network Analysis. In SLE patients, comparative analysis of BMMCs genes revealed a network with 19 central nodes as major gene regulators including ERK, JNK, and p38 MAP kinases, insulin, Ca(2+) and STAT3. Comparison between active versus inactive SLE identified 30 central nodes associated with immune response, protein synthesis, and post-transcriptional modification. A high degree of identity between networks in active SLE and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) patients was found, with overlapping central nodes including kinases (MAPK, ERK, JNK, PKC), transcription factors (NF-kappaB, STAT3), and insulin. In validation studies, western blot analysis in splenic B cells from 5-month-old NZB/NZW F1 lupus mice showed activation of STAT3, ITGB2, HSPB1, ERK, JNK, p38, and p32 kinases, and downregulation of FOXO3 and VDR compared to normal C57Bl/6 mice.Gene network analysis of lupus BMMCs identified central gene regulators implicated in disease pathogenesis which could represent targets of novel therapies in human SLE. The high similarity between active SLE and NHL networks provides a molecular basis for the reported association of the former with lymphoid malignancies."

From the crystal structure of hLTC<sub>4</sub>S, Arg-104 and Arg-31 have been implicated in the conjugation reaction. Here, we used site-directed mutagenesis, UV spectroscopy, and x-ray crystallography to examine the catalytic role of Arg-104 and Arg-31. Exchange of Arg-104 with Ala, Ser, Thr, or Lys abolished 94.3–99.9% of the specific activity against LTA<sub>4</sub>. Steady-state kinetics of R104A and R104S revealed that the <i>K<sub>m</sub></i> for GSH was not significantly affected. UV difference spectra of the binary enzyme-GSH complex indicated that GSH ionization depends on the presence of Arg-104 because no thiolate signal, with λ<sub>max</sub> at 239 nm, could be detected using R104A or R104S hLTC<sub>4</sub>S. Apparently, the interaction of Arg-104 with the thiol group of GSH reduces its p<i>K<sub>a</sub></i> to allow formation of a thiolate anion and subsequent nucleophilic attack at C6 of LTA<sub>4</sub>. On the other hand, exchange of Arg-31 with Ala or Glu reduced the catalytic activity of hLTC<sub>4</sub>S by 88 and 70%, respectively, without significantly affecting the <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K<sub>m</sub></i> values for GSH, and a crystal structure of R31Q hLTC<sub>4</sub>S (2.1 Å) revealed a Gln-31 side chain pointing away from the active site. We conclude that Arg-104 plays a critical role in the catalytic mechanism of hLTC<sub>4</sub>S, whereas a functional role of Arg-31 seems more elusive. Because Arg-104 is a conserved residue, our results pertain to other homologous membrane proteins and represent a structure-function paradigm probably common to all microsomal GSH transferases."

Although the x-ray structure of wild type glucosylceramidase has been resolved, little is known about the structural features of any of the >200 mutations. Various treatments for Gaucher disease are available, including enzyme replacement and chaperone therapies. The latter involves binding of competitive inhibitors at the active site to enable correct folding and transport of the mutant enzyme to the lysosome. We now use molecular dynamics, a set of structural analysis tools, and several statistical methods to determine the flexible behavior of the N370S Gaucher mutant at various pH values, with and without binding the chaperone, N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin. We focus on the effect of the chaperone on the whole protein, on the active site, and on three important structural loops, and we demonstrate how the chaperone modifies the behavior of N370S in such a way that it becomes more active at lysosomal pH. Our results suggest a mechanism whereby the binding of N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin helps target correctly folded glucosylceramidase to the lysosome, contributes to binding with saposin C, and explains the initiation of the substrate-enzyme complex. Such analysis provides a new framework for determination of the structure of other Gaucher disease mutants and suggests new approaches for rational drug design.

https://openalex.org/W2124082519,"Yersinia pestis is the etiologic agent of plague that has killed more than 200 million people throughout the recorded history of mankind. Antibiotics may provide little immediate relief to patients who have a high bacteremia or to patients infected with an antibiotic resistant strain of plague. Two virulent factors of Y. pestis are the capsid F1 protein and the low-calcium response (Lcr) V-protein or V-antigen that have been proven to be the targets for both active and passive immunization. There are mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the F1- and V-antigens that can passively protect mice in a murine model of plague; however, there are no anti-Yersinia pestis monoclonal antibodies available for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment in humans. We identified one anti-F1-specific human mAb (m252) and two anti-V-specific human mAb (m253, m254) by panning a naïve phage-displayed Fab library against the F1- and V-antigens. The Fabs were converted to IgG1s and their binding and protective activities were evaluated. M252 bound weakly to peptides located at the F1 N-terminus where a protective mouse anti-F1 mAb also binds. M253 bound strongly to a V-antigen peptide indicating a linear epitope; m254 did not bind to any peptide from a panel of 53 peptides suggesting that its epitope may be conformational. M252 showed better protection than m253 and m254 against a Y, pestis challenge in a plague mouse model. A synergistic effect was observed when the three antibodies were combined. Incomplete to complete protection was achieved when m252 was given at different times post-challenge. These antibodies can be further studied to determine their potential as therapeutics or prophylactics in Y. pestis infection in humans."

Data on twins and on relatives of long-lived subjects suggested that the occurrence/accumulation of these mutations may be genetically influenced. To further investigate control region somatic heteroplasmy in the elderly, we analyzed the segment surrounding the nt 150 position (previously reported as specific of Leukocytes) in various types of leukocytes obtained from 195 ultra-nonagenarians sib-pairs of Italian or Finnish origin collected in the frame of the GEHA Project. We found a significant correlation of the mtDNA control region heteroplasmy between sibs, confirming a genetic influence on this phenomenon. Furthermore, many subjects showed heteroplasmy due to mutations different from the C150T transition. In these cases heteroplasmy was correlated within sibpairs in Finnish and northern Italian samples, but not in southern Italians. This suggested that the genetic contribution to control region mutations may be population specific. Finally, we observed a possible correlation between heteroplasmy and Hand Grip strength, one of the best markers of physical performance and of mortality risk in the elderly. Our study provides new evidence on the relevance of mtDNA somatic mutations in aging and longevity and confirms that the occurrence of specific point mutations in the mtDNA control region may represent a strategy for the age-related remodelling of organismal functions."
https://openalex.org/W2029452957,"Mammalian reoviruses replicate in a broad range of hosts, cells, and tissues. These viruses display strain-dependent variation in tropism for different types of cells in vivo and ex vivo. Early steps in the reovirus life cycle, attachment, entry, and disassembly, have been identified as pivotal points of virus-cell interaction that determine the fate of infection, either productive or abortive. However, in studies of the differential capacity of reovirus strains type 1 Lang and type 3 Dearing to replicate in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, we found that replication efficiency is regulated at a late point in the viral life cycle following primary transcription and translation. Results of genetic studies using recombinant virus strains show that reovirus tropism for MDCK cells is primarily regulated by replication protein μ2 and further influenced by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase protein, λ3, depending on the viral genetic background. Furthermore, μ2 residue 347 is a critical determinant of replication efficiency in MDCK cells. These findings indicate that components of the reovirus replication complex are mediators of cell-selective viral replication capacity at a post-entry step. Thus, reovirus cell tropism may be determined at early and late points in the viral replication program."
https://openalex.org/W2166569567,"Bax is the major multidomain proapoptotic molecule that is required for apoptosis. It has been reported that phosphorylation of Bax at serine(S) 163 or S184 activates or inactivates its proapoptotic function, respectively. To uncover the mechanism(s) by which phosphorylation regulates the proapoptotic function of Bax, a series of serine (S)→ alanine/glutamate (A/E) Bax mutants, including S163A, S184A, S163E, S184E, S163E/S184A (EA), S163A/S184E (AE), S163A/S184A (AA) and S163E/S184E (EE), were created to abrogate or mimic, respectively, either single or double-site phosphorylation. The compound Bax mutants (i.e. EA and AE) can flesh out the functional contribution of individual phosphorylation site(s). WT and each of these Bax mutants were overexpressed in Bax−/− MEF or lung cancer H157 cells and the proapoptotic activities were compared. Intriguingly, expression of any of Bax mutants containing the mutation S→A at S184 (i.e. S184A, EA or AA) represents more potent proapoptotic activity as compared to WT Bax in association with increased 6A7 epitope conformational change, mitochondrial localization/insertion and prolonged half-life. In contrast, all Bax mutants containing the mutation S→E at S184 (i.e. S184E, AE or EE) have a mobility-shift and fail to insert into mitochondrial membranes with decreased protein stability and less apoptotic activity. Unexpectedly, mutation either S→A or S→E at S163 site does not significantly affect the proapoptotic activity of Bax. These findings indicate that S184 but not S163 is the major phosphorylation site for functional regulation of Bax's activity. Therefore, manipulation of the phosphorylation status of Bax at S184 may represent a novel strategy for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2108934064,"In addition to inhibiting insulin receptor and IGF1R kinase activity by directly binding to the receptors, GRB10 can also negatively regulate insulin and IGF1 signaling by mediating insulin receptor and IGF1R degradation through ubiquitination. It has been shown that GRB10 can interact with the C2 domain of the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 through its Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. Therefore, GRB10 might act as a connector, bringing NEDD4 close to IGF1R to facilitate the ubiquitination of IGF1R by NEDD4. This is the first case in which it has been found that an SH2 domain could colocalize a ubiquitin ligase and its substrate. Here we report the crystal structure of the NEDD4 C2-GRB10 SH2 complex at 2.0 Å. The structure shows that there are three interaction interfaces between NEDD4 C2 and GRB10 SH2. The main interface centers on an antiparallel β-sheet composed of the F β-strand of GRB10 SH2 and the C β-strand of NEDD4 C2. NEDD4 C2 binds at nonclassical sites on the SH2 domain surface, far from the classical phosphotyrosine-binding pocket. Hence, this interaction is phosphotyrosine-independent, and GRB10 SH2 can bind the C2 domain of NEDD4 and the kinase domain of IGF1R simultaneously. Based on these results, a model of how NEDD4 interacts with IGF1R through GRB10 has been proposed. This report provides further evidence that SH2 domains can participate in important signaling interactions beyond the classical recognition of phosphotyrosine.

The mechanisms of the negative regulation of IR and IGF1R by GRB10 and GRB14 are not yet clear. Biochemical studies have shown that GRB10 and GRB14 can bind IR and IGF1R through their BPS and SH2 domains (20.Depetris R.S. Hu J. Gimpelevich I. Holt L.J. Daly R.J. Hubbard S.R. Mol.

The GRB14 BPS region binds as a pseudosubstrate inhibitor in the tyrosine kinase domain of IR to suppress insulin signaling (20.Depetris R.S. Hu J. Gimpelevich I. Holt L.J. Daly R.J. Hubbard S.R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 325-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Suppressing endogenous GRB10 expression led to increased IR protein levels, whereas overexpression of GRB10 led to reduced IR protein levels (7.Ramos F.J. Langlais P.R. Hu D. Dong L.Q. Liu F. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol Metab. 2006; 290: E1262-E1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Reduced IR levels were observed in cells with prolonged insulin treatment, and this reduction was inhibited in GRB10-deficient cells (7.Ramos F.J. Langlais P.R. Hu D. Dong L.Q. Liu F. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol Metab. 2006; 290: E1262-E1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The insulin-induced IR reduction was largely reversed by MG-132, a proteasomal inhibitor, but not by chloroquine, a lysosomal inhibitor. IR undergoes insulin-stimulated ubiquitination in cells, and this ubiquitination was inhibited in the GRB10-suppressed cell line (7.Ramos F.J. Langlais P.R. Hu D. Dong L.Q. Liu F. Am. J. Physiol.

Therefore, in addition to inhibiting IR kinase activity by directly binding to IR through its BPS and SH2 domains, GRB10 also negatively regulates insulin signaling by affecting insulin-stimulated degradation of the receptor, possibly through regulation of ubiquitination of the receptor. GRB10 and GRB14 do not themselves have ubiquitin ligase activity. However, it has been shown that GRB10 binds the C2 domain of the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 through its SH2 domain, and formation of the complex promotes IGF1-stimulated multiubiquitination, internalization, and degradation of the IGF1R (23.Monami G.

Therefore, the SH2 domain of GRB10 might act as a connector between the C2 domain of NEDD4 and the kinase domain of IGF1R; proximity of NEDD4 and IGF1R would facilitate the ubiquitination of IGF1R by NEDD4. However, SH2 is typically highly specialized for the recognition of phosphotyrosine and has only one binding site for phosphotyrosine-containing peptides (the Tyr(P)-binding pocket). It was not clear how the SH2 domain of GRB10 can bind the C2 domain of NEDD4 and the kinase domain of IGF1R simultaneously, although the possibility of a second binding site was suggested by the observation that the NEDD4 C2-GRB10 SH2 interaction is phosphorylation-independent (25.Morrione A. Plant P. Valentinis B. Staub O. Kumar S. Rotin D. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24094-24099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Here we report the crystal structure of the NEDD4 C2-GRB10 SH2 complex, which clearly shows that the SH2 domain of GRB10 binds the C2 domain of NEDD4 through a surface region distinct from the classical Tyr(P)-binding pocket. The cDNA encoding the mouse GRB10 SH2 domain (residues 429–536) was amplified from the plasmid pcDNA-Grb10γ (a kind gift from Dr. Junlin Guan) and inserted into the expression vector pQE80 to make a pQE80-SH2 expression construct. This construct was transferred into BL21(DE3) (Novagen) for protein expression. Protein expression was induced at 37 °C for 4 h with 0.3 mm IPTG. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and then suspended in binding buffer (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm benzamidine chloride). Cell lysis was carried out by sonication. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a nickel affinity column. After protein binding, the column was washed thoroughly with 100 volumes of binding buffer followed by 10 volumes of washing buffer (500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 40 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm benzamidine chloride). The protein was then eluted from the column with 5 volumes of elution buffer (200 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm benzamidine chloride). The protein solution was concentrated and further purified by FPLC using a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) with an elution buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl and 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The cDNA encoding the full-length mouse GRB10γ (an isoform of GRB10) was inserted into the expression vector pMAL-2C to make a pMAL-2C-Grb10γ expression construct. This construct was transferred into BL21(DE3) for protein expression. The harvested cells were lysed in the binding buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm benzamidine chloride) by sonication, and the supernatant was applied to a maltose-agarose column. The column was washed thoroughly with 100 volumes of binding buffer, and the maltose-binding protein-GRB10γ fusion protein was eluted with 3 volumes of elution buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm maltose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm CaCl2). After the addition of Factor Xa, this elution solution was incubated at 4 °C for 48 h to cleave off the maltose-binding protein tag. The protein solution was then concentrated and purified with a Superdex 200 column. The cDNA encoding the mouse NEDD4 C2 domain (residues 108–287) was amplified from the plasmid pBS-Nedd4 (a kind gift from Dr. Andrea Morrione) and inserted into the expression vector pSUMO (Invitrogen) to make a pSUMO-Nedd4 C2 expression construct. This construct was transferred into BL21(DE3) for protein expression. Protein expression was induced at 22 °C overnight with 0.3 mm IPTG. The protein was purified with a nickel column using the method described above. After the column was washed thoroughly with 100 volumes of binding buffer followed by 10 volumes of washing buffer, the protease SUMOase was added to the column and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h to cleave off the SUMO·His tag. The free protein C2 was eluted, concentrated, and further purified with a Superdex 200 column. Truncations of NEDD4 C2 (residues 108–250, 200–300, and 115–287, respectively) were cloned, expressed, and purified using the same procedure as for wild type NEDD4 C2. To express GRB10 SH2 without any tag, the cDNA encoding the mouse GRB10 SH2 domain (residues 429–536) was inserted into the expression vector pCDFDuet-1 to make pCDFDuet-SH2. To prepare the NEDD4 C2-GRB10 SH2 complex for crystallization, the plasmids pSUMO-C2 and pCDFDuet-SH2 were co-transferred into the host cell BL21(DE3) for co-expression. In this system, the expression level of NEDD4 C2-SUMO·His was higher than that of GRB10 SH2. Protein expression was induced at 15 °C for 24 h with 0.3 mm IPTG. The cell pellet was suspended in binding buffer (200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm benzamidine chloride) and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a nickel affinity column. After protein binding, the column was washed thoroughly with 100 volumes of binding buffer followed by 10 volumes of washing buffer (200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 40 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm benzamidine chloride). Then protease SUMOase was added to the column and incubated at 4 °C for 24 h to cleave off the SUMO·His tag. The free proteins (NEDD4 C2-GRB10 SH2 complex and isolated NEDD4 C2) were eluted, concentrated, and purified with a Superdex 200 column. The fractions containing the NEDD4 C2-GRB10 SH2 complex were collected and further purified using a SourceQ column (GE Healthcare) for FPLC. GRB10 SH2 (with an N-terminal His tag, GRB10 SH2·His) was mixed with NEDD4 C2 (without tag) in a 1:1 molar ratio (as judged by A280) in the incubating buffer (150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) containing 20 mm EGTA or 20 mm CaCl2, on ice, for 2 h. Similarly, GRB10γ (without tag) was mixed with NEDD4 C2·SUMO·His in a 1:1 molar ratio in the incubating buffer containing 20 mm EGTA or 20 mm CaCl2, on ice, for 2 h. Then EGTA or CaCl2 in the mixtures was removed by a sizing column. The fraction containing proteins from the sizing column was collected and applied onto a nickel affinity column. After protein binding, the column was washed with 100 volumes of incubating buffer and further washed with 10 volumes of washing buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, and 40 mm imidazole, pH 8.5). 15 μl of gel slurry was drawn for analysis by SDS-PAGE. GRB10 SH2·His and NEDD4 C2 were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio in the incubating buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5). After being incubated on ice for 2 h, the NEDD4 C2-GRB10 SH2·His complex was bound to a nickel column. Then the column was eluted with incubating buffer containing different NaCl concentrations (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 1000 mm, sequentially). For each concentration, 2 volumes of incubating buffer were used. The eluted solutions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The cDNAs encoding mouse GRB14 SH2 domain and GRB7 SH2 domain were separately inserted into the expression vector pGEX4T-1. The resulting constructs pGEX4T-GRB14 SH2 and pGEX4T-GRB7 SH2 were co-transferred, respectively, with pSUMO-NEDD4 C2 into the host cell BL21(DE3). Protein expression was induced with 0.3 mm IPTG at 15 °C for 24 h. The cells were collected and resuspended in PBS for lysis by sonication. The supernatant from the cell lysis was purified using a nickel affinity column and a glutathione-agarose column sequentially. After the column was washed thoroughly, 15 μl of gel slurry was drawn and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The cDNAs encoding mouse GRB14 and GRB7 were separately inserted into the expression vector pQE80 to express the target proteins with N-terminal His tags. Purified GRB14·His (or GRB7·His) was mixed with NEDD4 C2 (without tag) in a 1:1 molar ratio in the incubating buffer (150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5). After being incubated on ice for 2 h, the mixture was applied to a nickel affinity column. After protein binding, the column was washed by 100 volumes of incubating buffer followed by 10 volumes of washing buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, and 40 mm imidazole, pH 8.5). Then 15 μl of gel slurry was drawn for analysis by SDS-PAGE. The purified NEDD4 C2-GRB10 SH2 complex showed two protein bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, corresponding to NEDD4 C2 and GRB10 SH2, respectively (Fig. 1A). The NEDD4 C2-GRB10 SH2 complex solution was desalted and concentrated to 20 mg/ml. Crystals were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 18 °C. Typically, 2 μl of the protein stock was mixed with 2 μl of the reservoir solution consisting of 35% MPD (v/v) and 0.1 m Hepes-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. Crystals were observed after 2 days and reached a typical size of 100 × 100 × 200 μm3 1 month later. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K on beamline A1 at MacCHESS. The diffraction data were reduced using the HKL package (26.Otwinoski Z. Minor W.

Open table in a new tab The structure of the NEDD4 C2-GRB10 SH2 complex was solved by the molecular replacement program Phaser (27.McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C.

Chem. 2003; 278: 13257-13264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1NRV) and the structure of human NEDD4 C2 (Protein Data Bank code 3B7Y) as the search models. The structure was refined using Refmac5 (29.Murshudov G. Vagin A. Dodson E. Acta Cryst. 1997; D53: 240-255Crossref Scopus (13851) Google Scholar) and PHENIX (30.Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G.

Acta Crystallogr. D. 2010; 66: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16428) Google Scholar). The refinement statistics are given in Table 1. The B factors are constant throughout the protein. For the GRB10 SH2 subunit (average B factor = 33.7 Å2), the B factors of its N terminus (residues 429–438) and C terminus (residues 526–535) are 32.1 and 37.6 Å2, respectively. For the NEDD4 C2 subunit (average B factor = 39.3 Å2), the B factors of its N terminus (residues 112–120) and C terminus (residues 281–287) are 41.1 and 40.5 Å2, respectively. The interface between GRB10 SH2 and NEDD4 C2 was analyzed using the program PISA (31.Krissinel E. Henrick K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 372: 774-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6766) Google Scholar) from the CCP4 suite (32.Collaborative Computational Project 4Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19747) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis of the NEDD4 C2-GRB10 SH2 crystals showed that the NEDD4 C2 and the GRB10 SH2 in the crystals had the same molecular weights as the original NEDD4 C2 and the original GRB10 SH2, respectively (Fig. 1B), suggesting that both NEDD4 C2 and GRB10 SH2 in the crystal are complete and have not been degraded. Site-directed mutations of GRB10 SH2 (K505P, N519A, R533A, R431A and H434A, respectively) were carried out using the Phusion mutation kit (New England Biolabs). The interaction between the GRB10 SH2 mutants and NEDD4 C2 was analyzed using the co-expression system described above. As shown by the yeast two-hybrid method, GRB10 can interact with the C2 domain of NEDD4 through its SH2 domain (25.Morrione A. Plant P. Valentinis B. Staub O. Kumar S. Rotin D. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24094-24099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The C2 domain is a conserved module of about 120 residues, which was first found in protein kinase C (33.Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In most proteins, the C2 domain binds phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner (34.Corbalán-García S. Gómez-Fernández J.C. Biofactors. 2010; 36: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Bai J. Chapman E.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 143-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar); in some proteins, it mediates protein-protein interactions (36.Benes C.H. Wu N. Elia A.E. Dharia T. Cantley L.C. Soltoff S.P. Cell. 2005; 121: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The C2 domain of NEDD4 has been shown to target NEDD4 to the plasma membrane in response to Ca2+ (37.Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). However, the interaction between NEDD4 and GRB10 has been demonstrated to be Ca2+-independent by the co-immunoprecipitation method (25.Morrione A. Plant P. Valentinis B. Staub O. Kumar S. Rotin D. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24094-24099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We performed a series of in vitro interaction experiments using purified C2 domain and purified SH2 domain (or full-length GRB10). As shown in Fig. 1A, NEDD4 C2 could form a complex with GRB10 SH2 in the presence of either 20 mm EGTA or 20 mm CaCl2, suggesting that the interaction between NEDD4 C2 and GRB10 SH2 was Ca2+-independent. NEDD4 C2 could also form a complex with full-length GRB10γ (an isoform of GRB10), and this interaction was also Ca2+-independent (Fig. 1A). The SH2 domain is a conserved module of about 100 residues, which is highly specialized for the recognition of phosphotyrosine, with only a few exceptions to date (38.Pawson T. Gish G.D. Nash P. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 504-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). However, GRB10 has been suggested to preferentially associate with unphosphorylated NEDD4 (based on co-immunoprecipitation experiments) (25.Morrione A. Plant P. Valentinis B. Staub O. Kumar S. Rotin D. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24094-24099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In our work, NEDD4 C2 was expressed in Escherichia coli, in which expressed proteins cannot be phosphorylated. The NEDD4 C2 domain produced in this system could form a complex with GRB10 SH2 or GRB10γ, indicating that binding of GRB10 SH2 to NEDD4 C2 is phosphorylation-independent. Both the NEDD4 C2-GRB10 SH2 complex and the NEDD4 C2-GRB10γ complex were stable in low ionic strength solution (<200 mm NaCl). The complexes dissociated in a solution containing more than 500 mm NaCl, in the presence or absence of 20 mm EGTA (or 20 mm CaCl2) (data not shown). These results suggested that the main interaction between NEDD4 C2 and GRB10 SH2 was not hydrophobic and was unaffected by Ca2+. The molecular mass of GRB10 SH2 is about 12 kDa. The molecular mass of NEDD4 C2 is about 19 kDa. As determined by a Superdex200 sizing column, the molecular mass of the NEDD4 C2-GRB10 SH2 complex was about 30 kDa, suggesting that this complex is a heterodimer in solution (Fig. 1C). All members of the GRB7 adaptor protein family (GRB7, GRB10, and GRB14) contain a Ras-associating-like domain, a pleckstrin homology domain, a family-specific BPS region, and a C-terminal SH2 domain (1.Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6315-6321Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 2.Holt L.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Because the SH2 domains are highly conserved among this family (Fig. 2), we investigated whether NEDD4 C2 could also bind the SH2 domains of GRB7 and GRB14, using the co-expression method. In the E. coli co-expression system, NEDD4 C2 was expressed with a SUMO·His tag, which could bind to a nickel-agarose column, whereas GRB7 SH2 and GRB14 SH2 were expressed with a GST tag, which could bind to a glutathione-agarose column but not a nickel column. If the SH2 domain can form a complex with C2·SUMO·His, it should be co-purified with C2·SUMO·His by a nickel column. As shown by SDS-PAGE analysis, the protein purified by a nickel column contained only NEDD4 C2·SUMO·His, whereas the protein purified by a glutathione-agarose column contained only GRB7 SH2·GST or GRB14 SH2·GST. Although both NEDD4 C2·SUMO·His and GRB7 SH2·GST (or GRB14 SH2·GST) were co-expressed in the same cell at high levels, neither of the SH2 domains could be co-purified with NEDD4 C2·SUMO·His by a nickel column, suggesting that neither GRB7 SH2 nor GRB14 SH2 could form a complex with NEDD4 C2. As a control, we showed that GRB10 SH2·GST could form a complex with NEDD4 C2·SUMO·His, suggesting that neither the GST tag nor the SUMO tag could inhibit the interaction between NEDD4 C2 and the SH2 domain. In vitro interactions between NEDD4 C2 and full-length GRB7 (or GRB14) were also investigated using purified proteins. As shown by SDS-PAGE analysis, NEDD4 C2 could not form a complex with GRB7 or GRB14. To gain further insights into the interaction between NEDD4 C2 and GRB10 SH2, we co-expressed NEDD4 C2 and GRB10 SH2 in E."
https://openalex.org/W2013546017,"Retrovirus replication requires specialized transport mechanisms to export genomic mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of the infected cell. This regulation is mediated by a combination of viral and/or cellular factors that interact with cis-acting RNA export elements linking the viral RNA to the cellular CRM1 or NXF1 nuclear export pathways. Endogenous type D murine LTR retrotransposons (musD) were reported to contain an RNA export element located upstream of the 3'-LTR. Although functionally equivalent, the musD export element, termed the musD transport element, is distinct from the other retroviral RNA export elements, such as the constitutive transport element of simian/Mason-Pfizer monkey retroviruses and the RNA transport element found in rodent intracisternal A-particle LTR retrotransposons. We demonstrate here that the minimal RNA transport element (musD transport element) of musD comprises multiple secondary structure elements that presumably serve as recognition signals for the cellular export machinery. We identified two classes of tertiary interactions, namely kissing loops and a pseudoknot. This work constitutes the first example of an RNA transport element requiring such structural motifs to mediate nuclear export."
https://openalex.org/W2153321650,"Background Inflammation is commonly followed by the release of endogenous proteins called danger associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that are able to warn the host for eminent danger. S100A8/A9 subunits are DAMPs that belong to the S100 family of calcium binding proteins. S100A8/A9 complexes induce an inflammatory response and their expression correlates with disease severity in several inflammatory disorders. S100A8/A9 promote endotoxin- and Escherichia (E.) coli-induced sepsis showing its contribution in systemic infection. The role of S100A8/A9 during a local infection of the urinary tract system caused by E. coli remains unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the contribution of S100A8/A9 in acute urinary tract infection (UTI) by instilling 2 different doses of uropathogenic E. coli transurethrally in wild type (WT) and S100A9 knockout (KO) mice. Subsequently, we determined bacterial outgrowth, neutrophilic infiltrate and inflammatory mediators in bladder and kidney 24 and 48 hours later. UTI resulted in a substantial increase of S100A8/A9 protein in bladder and kidney tissue of WT mice. S100A9 KO mice displayed similar bacterial load in bladder or kidney homogenate compared to WT mice using 2 different doses at 2 different time points. S100A9 deficiency had little effect on the inflammatory responses to E. Coli-induced UTI infection, as assessed by myeloperoxidase activity in bladder and kidneys, histopathologic analysis, and renal and bladder cytokine concentrations. Conclusions We show that despite high S100A8/A9 expression in bladder and kidney tissue upon UTI, S100A8/A9 does not contribute to an effective host response against E. Coli in the urinary tract system."
https://openalex.org/W2012258930,"Background Ionotropic glutamate receptors in the central nervous system play a major role in numerous brain functions including learning and memory in many vertebrate species. NR2 subunits have been regarded as rate-limiting molecules in controlling the optimal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor's coincidence-detection property and subsequent learning and memory function across multi-species. However, its evolutionary mode among vertebrate species remains unclear. Results With extensive analysis of phylogeny, exon structure, protein domain, paralogon and synteny, we demonstrated that two-round genome duplication generated quartet GRIN2 genes and the third-round fish-specific genome duplication generated extra copies of fish GRIN2 genes. In addition, in-depth investigation has enabled the identification of three novel genes, GRIN2C_Gg, GRIN2D-1_Ol and GRIN2D-2_Tr in the chicken, medaka and fugu genome, respectively. Furthermore, we showed functional divergence of NR2 genes mostly occurred at the first-round duplication, amino acid residues located at the N-terminal Lig_chan domain were responsible for type I functional divergence between these GRIN2 subfamilies and purifying selection has been the prominent natural pressure operating on these diversified GRIN2 genes. Conclusion and Significance These findings provide intriguing subjects for testing the 2R and 3R hypothesis and we expect it could provide new insights into the underlying evolution mechanisms of cognition in vertebrate."
https://openalex.org/W2031813733,"Prior research has often linked anxiety to attentional vigilance for threat using the dot probe task, which presents probes in spatial locations that were or were not preceded by a putative threat stimulus. The present study investigated the impact of worry on threat vigilance by administering this task during a worry condition and during a mental arithmetic control condition to 56 undergraduate students scoring in the low normal range on a measure of chronic worry. The worry induction was associated with faster responses than arithmetic to probes in the attended location following threat words, indicating the combined influence of worry and threat in facilitating attention. Within the worry condition, responses to probes in the attended location were faster for trials containing threat words than for trials with only neutral words, whereas the converse pattern was observed for responses to probes in the unattended location. This connection between worry states and attentional capture by threat may be central to understanding the impact of hypervigilance on information processing in anxiety and its disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2120539803,"Hypertension is a serious risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene locus is associated with human essential hypertension. The human AGT (hAGT) gene has an A/G polymorphism at −6, and the −6A allele is associated with increased blood pressure. However, transgenic mice containing 1.2 kb of the promoter with −6A of the hAGT gene show neither increased plasma AGT level nor increased blood pressure compared with −6G. We have found that the hAGT gene has three additional SNPs (A/G at −1670, C/G at −1562, and T/G at −1561). Variants −1670A, −1562C, and −1561T almost always occur with −6A, and variants −1670G, −1562G, and −1561G almost always occur with −6G. Therefore, the hAGT gene may be subdivided into either −6A or −6G haplotypes. We show that these polymorphisms affect the binding of HNF-1α and glucocorticoid receptor to the promoter, and a reporter construct containing a 1.8-kb hAGT gene promoter with −6A haplotype has 4-fold increased glucocorticoid-induced promoter activity as compared with −6G haplotype. In order to understand the physiological significance of these haplotypes in an in vivo situation, we have generated double transgenic mice containing either the −6A or −6G haplotype of the hAGT gene and the human renin gene.

Initially no prediction of the three-dimensional structure of Pur-α was possible. However, recently we solved the X-ray structure of Pur-α from the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster and showed that it contains a so-called PUR domain. Here we explain how we exploited bioinformatics tools in combination with X-ray structure determination of a bacterial homolog to obtain diffracting crystals and the high-resolution structure of Drosophila Pur-α. First, we used sensitive methods for remote-homology detection to find three repetitive regions in Pur-α. We realized that our lack of understanding how these repeats interact to form a globular domain was a major problem for crystallization and structure determination. With our information on the repeat motifs we then identified a distant bacterial homolog that contains only one repeat. We determined the bacterial crystal structure and found that two of the repeats interact to form a globular domain. Based on this bacterial structure, we calculated a computational model of the eukaryotic protein. The model allowed us to design a crystallizable fragment and to determine the structure of Drosophila Pur-α. Key for success was the fact that single repeats of the bacterial protein self-assembled into a globular domain, instructing us on the number and boundaries of repeats to be included for crystallization trials with the eukaryotic protein. This study demonstrates that the simpler structural domain arrangement of a distant prokaryotic protein can guide the design of eukaryotic crystallization constructs. Since many eukaryotic proteins contain multiple repeats or repeating domains, this approach might be instructive for structural studies of a range of proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2027590801,"Background The Ca2+-stimulated adenylyl cyclases (ACs), AC1 and AC8, are key components of long-term memory processing. AC1 and AC8 double knockout mice (Adcy1−/−Adcy8−/−; DKO) display impaired fear memory processing; the mechanism of this impairment is largely unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We hypothesize that the Ca2+-stimulated ACs modulate long-lasting transcriptional changes essential for fear memory consolidation and maintenance. Here, we report a genome-wide study of gene expression changes associated with conditioned fear (CF) memory in wild-type and DKO mice to identify AC-dependent gene regulatory changes that occur in the amygdala and hippocampus at baseline and different time points after CF learning. We observed an overall decrease in transcriptional changes in DKO mice across all time points, but most strikingly, at periods when memory consolidation and retention should be occurring. Further, we identified a shared set of transcription factor binding sites in genes upregulated in wild-type mice that were associated with downregulated genes in DKO mice. To prove the temporal and regional importance of AC activity on different stages of memory processing, the tetracycline-off system was used to produce mice with forebrain-specific inducible expression of AC8 on a DKO background. CF behavioral results reveal that adult restoration of AC8 activity in the forebrain is sufficient for intact learning, while cessation of this expression at any time point across learning causes memory deficits. Conclusions/Significance Overall, these studies demonstrate that the Ca2+-stimulated ACs contribute to the formation and maintenance of fear memory by a network of long-term transcriptional changes."

Recently, SOCS3 was shown to be induced by a cAMP-dependent pathway involving exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac). We observed in livers of fasted mice that Socs3 mRNA was increased 4-fold compared with refed mice, suggesting a physiologic role for SOCS3 in the fasted state that may involve glucagon and Epac. Treating primary hepatocytes with glucagon resulted in a 4-fold increase in Socs3 mRNA levels. The Epac-selective cAMP analog 8–4-(chlorophenylthio)-2′-O-methyladenosine-3′,5′-monophosphate, acetoxymethyl ester (cpTOME) increased Socs3 expression comparably. In gain-of-function studies, adenoviral expression of SOCS3 in primary hepatocytes caused a 50% decrease in 8-br-cAMP-dependent PKA phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB. Induction of the gluconeogenic genes Ppargc1a, Pck1, and G6pc by glucagon or 8-br-cAMP was suppressed nearly 50%. In loss-of-function studies, hepatocytes from liver-specific SOCS3 knock-out mice responded to 8-br-cAMP with a 200% greater increase in Ppargc1a and Pck1 expression, and a 30% increase in G6pc expression, relative to wild-type cells. Suppression of SOCS3 by shRNA in hepatocytes resulted in a 60% increase in cAMP-dependent G6pc and Pck1 expression relative to control cells. SOCS3 expression also inhibited cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of the IP3 receptor but did not inhibit nuclear localization of the catalytic subunit of PKA. Using an in vitro kinase assay, cAMP-dependent PKA activity was reduced by 80% in hepatocytes expressing ectopic SOCS3. These data indicate that cAMP activates both the PKA and Epac pathways with induction of SOCS3 by the Epac pathway negatively regulating the PKA pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2074604380,"Immunological and clinical outcomes can vary considerably at the individual and population levels during both treated and untreated HIV-1 infection. Cytokines encoded by the interleukin-10 gene (IL10) family have broad immunomodulatory function in viral persistence, and several SNPs in the IL10 promoter sequence have been reported to influence pathogenesis or acquisition of HIV-1 infection.We examined 104 informative SNPs in IL10, IL19, IL20, IL24, IL10RA and IL10RB among 250 HIV-1 seropositive and 106 high-risk seronegative African American adolescents in the REACH cohort. In subsequent evaluation of five different immunological and virological outcomes related to HIV-1 infection, 25 SNPs were associated with a single outcome and three were associated with two different outcomes. One SNP, rs2243191 in the IL19 open reading frame (Ser to Phe substitution) was associated with CD4(+) T-cell increase during treatment. Another SNP rs2244305 in IL10RB (in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs443498) was associated with an initial decrease in CD4(+) T-cell by 23 ± 9% and 29 ± 9% every 3 months (for AA and AG genotypes, respectively, compared with GG) during ART-free period. These associations were reversed during treatment, as CD4(+) T-cell increased by 31 ± 0.9% and 17 ± 8% every 3 months for AA and AG genotype, respectively.In African Americans, variants in IL10 and related genes might influence multiple outcomes of HIV-1 infection, especially immunological response to HAART. Fine mapping coupled with analysis of gene expression and function should help reveal the immunological importance of the IL10 gene family to HIV-1/AIDS."
https://openalex.org/W2143822713,"The activity of basic motivational systems is reflected in emotional responses to arousing stimuli, such as natural pictures. The manipulation of picture properties such as size or detail allows for investigation into the extent to which separate emotional reactions are similarly modulated by perceptual changes, or, rather, may subserve different functions. Pursuing this line of research, the present study examined the effects of two types of perceptual degradation, namely picture size reduction and blurring, on emotional responses. Both manipulations reduced picture relevance and dampened affective modulation of skin conductance, possibly because of a reduced action preparation in response to degraded or remote pictures. However, the affective modulation of the startle reflex did not vary with picture degradation, suggesting that the identification of these degraded affective cues activated the neural circuits mediating appetitive or defensive motivation."
https://openalex.org/W1978437893,"The retinoid 4-oxo-N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-oxo-4-HPR) is a polar metabolite of fenretinide (4-HPR) very effective in killing cancer cells of different histotypes, able to inhibit 4-HPR-resistant cell growth and to act synergistically in combination with the parent drug. Unlike 4-HPR and other retinoids, 4-oxo-4-HPR inhibits tubulin polymerization, leading to multipolar spindle formation and mitotic arrest. Here we investigated whether 4-oxo-4-HPR, like 4-HPR, triggered cell death also via reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and whether its antimicrotubule activity was related to a ROS-dependent mechanism in ovarian (A2780), breast (T47D), cervical (HeLa) and neuroblastoma (SK-N-BE) cancer cell lines.We provided evidence that 4-oxo-4-HPR, besides acting as an antimicrotubule agent, induced apoptosis through a signaling cascade starting from ROS generation and involving endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) activation, and upregulation of the proapoptotic PLAcental Bone morphogenetic protein (PLAB). Through time-course analysis and inhibition of the ROS-related signaling pathway (upstream by vitamin C and downstream by PLAB silencing), we demonstrated that the antimitotic activity of 4-oxo-4-HPR was independent from the oxidative stress induced by the retinoid. In fact, ROS generation occurred earlier than mitotic arrest (within 30 minutes and 2 hours, respectively) and abrogation of the ROS-related signaling pathway did not prevent the 4-oxo-4-HPR-induced mitotic arrest.These data indicate that 4-oxo-4-HPR anticancer activity is due to at least two independent mechanisms and provide an explanation of the ability of 4-oxo-4-HPR to be more potent than the parent drug and to be effective also in 4-HPR-resistant cell lines. In addition, the double mechanism of action could allow 4-oxo-4-HPR to efficiently target tumour and to eventually counteract the development of drug resistance."

Zygotic canonical wnt8 expression appears exclusively at the ventrolateral margin and mediates Wnt/β-catenin activities to promote posterior and ventral cell fate.

A large body of evidence shows that the dorsal organizer is generated by maternal β-catenin proteins translocating specifically to the nuclei of the dorsal margin, which activates the zygotic expression of dorsal-specific genes, including boz, chordin, and dickkopf1 (1.Schier A.F.

Embryos that have a homozygous wnt8 mutant show severe phenotypes that are characterized by an expansion of the dorsal organizer and a significant reduction of the ventral posterior structure (14.Lekven A.C.

Numerous studies have examined the transduction mechanisms of Wnt signaling cascades. Although the downstream transduction molecules of the Wnt signaling pathway have been studied extensively (7.Grigoryan T. Wend P. Klaus A. Birchmeier W.

Drug Targets. 2008; 9: 513-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the control of zygotic wnt expression is poorly understood, particularly the mechanisms involved in the initiation and direct regulation of wnt ligand transcription during embryonic development. For instance, inhibition of the mesoderm inducing signal nodal activity leads to a reduction in wnt8 expression (13.Erter C.E. Wilm T.P. Basler N. Wright C.V. Solnica-Krezel L. Development. 2001; 128: 3571-3583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Ragland J.W. Raible D.W. Dev. Biol. 2004; 276: 16-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Moreover, the overexpression of fgf8a (fibroblast growth factor 8a) mRNA in Xenopus results in ectopic wnt8 expression (16.Hong C.S. Park B.Y. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Development. 2008; 135: 3903-3910Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These phenotypes may be derived from the mesoderm induction effects of nodal or FGF signal activities. BMP signaling has also been shown to positively regulate wnt8 expression in Xenopus (17.Hoppler S. Moon R.T. Mech. Dev. 1998; 71: 119-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The T-box transcription factor ntl regulates wnt8 expression during the late stage (18.Li H.Y. Bourdelas A. Carron C. Gomez C. Boucaut J.C. Shi D.L. Dev.

Kessler D.S. Development. 2001; 128: 2975-2987Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Published data show that the regulation activities of wnt8 expression occur during the late stage of the zygotic wnt8 expression program. However, there is still no evidence that an endogenous transcription factor can directly bind to the wnt8 promoter and initiate zygotic wnt8 expression. In this study, we show that a novel transcription factor, Kzp, directly binds to the wnt8 promoter and controls the initiation and maintenance of wnt8 transcription as a mechanism for regulating the primary body axis formation. Depletion of the Kzp protein leads to gastrulation defects, including convergent extension (CE) movement and dorsoventral patterning abnormalities, whereas overexpression inhibits eye formation. These are similar to the phenotypes caused by Wnt8 depletion or overexpression, respectively. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that Kzp is a DNA-binding protein that specifically interacts with the wnt8 promoter, which contains multiple consensus Kzp-binding sites, and controls the initiation and maintenance of zygotic wnt8 expression. A reduction in Kzp activity dramatically inhibits wnt8 transcription and blocks wnt8 expression induced by FGF signaling. Our results suggest that the regulation of wnt8 expression by Kzp is critical for embryonic patterning. kzp cDNA was amplified with primers and subcloned into pBluescript SK to make antisense and sense probes for in situ hybridization. The coding region of kzp was clone into pcDNA-FLAG for mRNA synthesis and mammalian cell expression. The upstream region of kzp cDNA, including the kzp MO2-targeted 5′-UTR, was cloned in frame into pEGFP-N1 for testing the effectiveness of kzp morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs).

Capped mRNAs were synthesized in vitro with the T7 or SP6 mRNA mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion). Antisense RNA for in situ hybridization was synthesized in the presence of digoxigenin-UTP. Injection was performed as described previously (21.Nasevicius A. Ekker S.C. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar). Morpholino or synthetic mRNA was injected into single-cell embryos. The injection dose was an estimated amount received by a single embryo. For RNA injection experiment, the control embryos were injected with GFP mRNA. Two antisense morpholino oligonucleotides, kzp MO1 (5′-TGCCTCCTCTGTGCCCTCTCCCATC-3′) and kzp MO2 (5′-TGTGCTTATTTCTGTGTTTCATTGG-3′), were synthesized to block the translation of kzp mRNA. Standard control MO was used as an injection control. The sequences and doses of wnt8 MOs targeting zebrafish wnt8 ORF1 and ORF2 were used as described (14.Lekven A.C. Thorpe C.J. Waxman J.S.

For cell migration experiments, cells from donor embryos injected with control MO and FITC-dextran (Mr 10,000, Invitrogen) or with kzp MO and rhodamine-dextran (Mr 10,000, Invitrogen) were transplanted into wild-type host embryos as described (22.Yao S.

For tracing lateral mesodermal cells, embryos at the one-cell stage were injected with a mixture of MO and kaede mRNA (50 pg). Then, at the shield stage (∼6–6.5 h post-fertilization), lateral mesodermal cells were labeled by converting the fluorescent spectrum of the Kaede protein from green to red fluorescence by exposure to 440 mm light for ∼1 min (23.Ando R.

Photoconversion was done at ×200 on a Zeiss Axioplan with a specially machined field diaphragm with a pinhole aperture of ∼50 μm. Migration of these red cells continued to be monitored to the one-somite stage. The cyclic amplification of select target (CAST) assay was performed with bacterially expressed GST-Kzp zinc fingers as described (24.Wright W.E. Binder M. Funk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4104-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Briefly, an 59-mer DNA was synthesized beginning with 5′-TGTGGCCCTTGACTTTGAGCAG-3′, followed by a stretch of 15 totally random bases and ending with the sequence 5′-TCGTCCACCGCAAATGCTTCTA-3′. The oligonucleotides were double-stranded by annealing with a reverse primer and extension for 30 min at 72 °C with Taq DNA polymerase. 50 ng of double-stranded DNA was incubated with 0.1 μg of purified GST-Kzp zinc finger fusion protein. The binding sequences were pull downed with 10 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (GE Healthcare). The selected double-stranded DNA was amplified by PCR. The products were used for the second CAST cycle. Eight sequential rounds of CAST were performed. The final PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector for sequencing. 43 clones from Kzp-ZFN and 12 clones from Kzp-ZFC were sequenced, and consensus DNA-binding sequences were visually examined. In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (25.Thisse C. Thisse B. Nat.

HEK293T cells were grown in DMEM plus 10% FBS. DNA transfection into HEK293T cells were performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). The antibody against the FLAG tag was purchased from Stratagene. GST-Kzp-ZFN and GST-Kzp-ZFC proteins were bacterially expressed and purified following the manufacturer's protocol (GE Healthcare). EMSA was performed as described by Aimee Kenoyer (Protocol Online). The 5′-biotin-labeled oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used were as follows: Kzp-BS, 5′-CTCGACAACCTTTAGCTGCCAACGCATTGTTC-3′; K mut1, 5′-CTCGACAAGGCGCTGCCAACGCATTGTTC-3′; K mut2, 5′-CTCGACAACCTTTAGTGACCAACGCATTGTTC-3′; K mut3, 5′-CTCGACAACCTTTAGCTGAACACGCATTGTTC-3′; and wnt8 promoter Kzp-binding element, 5′-AATTGTCTGATTTACTGCCAATTGTTTTGG-3′. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed as described (26.Boyd K.E. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8393-8399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). About 200 embryos were injected with Kzp-FLAG plasmid at the one-cell stage and harvested at the shield stage. The harvested embryos were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, homogenized with a 1-ml Dounce tissue grinder, and then sonicated in 500 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) to generate 300–500-bp fragments. Fragmented chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of each antibody. Precipitated DNA was purified and used for PCR. The primer pair used for the amplification of zebrafish wnt8 intron 1 was 5′-ACCTATGTTCAAGAAACCAAACTAA-3′ and 5′-TAGCCGTTGATGGTGTAGTGTA-3′; the primers flanking the binding region of the wnt8 promoter were 5′-AACAATTGGCAGTAAATCAGAC-3′ and 5′-AAATGTATCACATTTCCTGGC-3′. We cloned the kzp gene from a zebrafish expression library by antibody screening and found that the zebrafish Kzp protein contains eight Krüppel-like C2H2-type zinc fingers, three of which are highly homologous to DNA-binding zinc finger domains within the Kaiso and BTB/POZ zinc finger proteins (supplemental Fig. S1) (27.Prokhortchouk A.

Kzp also lacks the known functional domains of zinc finger proteins, including the BTB domain, which is found in the Kaiso and BTB/POZ zinc finger proteins (28.Albagli O. Dhordain P. Deweindt C.

These findings suggest that Kzp does not belong to any of the known protein families and is a novel DNA-binding protein. Consistent with this hypothesis, the Kzp protein was found to localize to nuclei when transfected into HEK293T cells (Fig. 1A). Whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed dynamic expression of kzp during zebrafish embryonic development (Fig. 1B). Kzp was maternally loaded, and the zygotic transcripts were distributed uniformly throughout the gastrula cells up to 24 h post-fertilization, at which point kzp mRNA was expressed in the anterior neural tissue at high levels. Subsequently, kzp mRNA was detected in the mid-hind brain boundary, forebrain, and eyes. RT-PCR analysis confirmed a similar temporal expression pattern (Fig. 1C). The expression pattern of Kzp suggested that the protein may function in the early embryonic development of zebrafish. Therefore, we wished to determine Kzp function by knocking down endogenous expression of Kzp with two non-overlapping, translation-blocking antisense MOs in zebrafish embryos. Both MOs dramatically inhibited the protein production of mRNA transcribed from a microinjected DNA construct containing the kzp gene fused to GFP (supplemental Fig. S2) and produced similar phenotypes in zebrafish embryos (Fig. 2, B–G). In addition, the phenotypes induced by the 5′-UTR MO were effectively rescued by the co-injection of synthetic FLAG-tagged kzp mRNA lacking the morpholino target (Fig. 2I). These data demonstrated that the two MOs efficiently and specifically blocked kzp mRNA translation. At 24 h post-fertilization, embryos that received kzp MO exhibited a reduction or loss of tail structure (Fig. 2, B–G, and supplemental Fig. S3). Almost all of the reduced tails in kzp MO-injected embryos curved dorsally, and the weakly reduced tails exhibited a loss of the ventral fin. These phenotypes are characteristics of embryonic dorsalization and resemble the phenotypes seen in mutant embryos that lack BMP or canonical Wnt signaling. To explore these phenotypes in more detail, we analyzed the expression of a set of dorsal- or ventral-specific genes. As shown in Fig. 2, the expression domains of the dorsal-specific genes chordin (72.7%, n = 33), floating head (74.2%, n = 31), and goosecoid (62.5%, n = 32) were expanded mediolaterally at the shield stage, whereas the domains of the ventral-specific genes eve1 (70.8%, n = 48) and tbx6 (78.5%, n = 41) were decreased in kzp MO-injected embryos (Fig. 2, J–U; data not shown). In contrast to the kzp MO phenotypes, the overexpression of kzp posteriorized the zebrafish embryos. Injection of kzp mRNA induced eyeless phenotypes, which are the features of posteriorized embryos. In embryos that received 200 pg of kzp mRNA at the one-cell stage, 24% of the embryos lost one eye, and 11% lost both eyes (n = 81). Moreover, 31 and 14% of the embryos that received 300 pg of kzp mRNA lost one or both eyes, respectively (n = 42). However, only 12% of the embryos injected with 300 pg of GFP mRNA lost one eye (n = 88) (supplemental Fig. S4). Taken together, these results suggest that kzp modulates the normal dorsoventral and anteroposterior patterning of zebrafish embryos. In addition to dorsalization, we also noted that kzp MO-injected embryos had a shorter and wider anteroposterior axis than control MO-injected embryos at the tail bud stage. The morphological abnormalities were highlighted by the altered expression patterns of several marker genes as a result of the loss of kzp activity. The ntl expression domain in the posterior axial mesoderm was shorter but wider in the kzp MO-injected embryos (76%, n = 25) (Fig. 3A, panels A7–A9). It was also apparent that injection of kzp MO led to less convergence and extension of the paraxial and lateral mesoderm, as shown by the alteration of the expression patterns of myoD (60.8%, n = 23) (Fig. 3A, panel A12) and papc (79.4%, n = 34) (panels A10 and A11). The dlx3 expression pattern indicated that the neural plate was much broader in kzp MO-injected embryos (76%, n = 25) (Fig. 3A, panels A7–A9). These phenotypes are frequently seen in embryos that have cell movement defects (29.Heisenberg C.P. Tada M. Rauch G.J. Saúde L. Concha M.L. Geisler R. Stemple D.L. Smith J.C. Wilson S.W. Nature. 2000; 405: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 30.Kilian B. Mansukoski H. Barbosa F.C. Ulrich F. Tada M. Heisenberg C.P. Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). To address whether cell movement, the CE movement, was affected in kzp-depleted embryos, we performed cell tracing studies of the migration of lateral mesodermal cells that were labeled at the shield stage with the green-to-red photoconverting protein Kaede (Fig. 3B). The labeled cells in control MO-injected embryos clearly converged toward the dorsal midline. In contrast, the labeled cells in kzp morphants showed less convergence (76.5%, n = 17) (Fig. 3C). Similar phenotypes were also observed by time-lapse analysis of cell movement (data not shown). To further characterize how kzp affects mesodermal cell movement, we performed cell transplantation experiments. Lateral mesodermal cells from the control MO-injected embryos and kzp MO-injected embryos were labeled with green and red fluorescence, respectively, and cotransplanted into the lateral mesoderm of a wild-type host embryo. As shown in Fig. 3E, at the end of gastrulation, all of the donor lateral mesodermal cells began to migrate toward the dorsal side and formed two overlapped strips along the anteroposterior axis near the midline, suggesting that the kzp-depleted lateral mesodermal cells recovered their dorsal convergence ability when transplanted into wild-type embryos. However, the strip of kzp MO-injected cells was much wider and shorter than that of the control cells (87.5%, n = 8), which was consistent with the altered expression pattern of the paraxial mesoderm marker myoD in kzp morphant embryos (Fig. 3A, panel A12). Together, these analyses revealed a critical role of Kzp in gastrulation movements. Specifically, Kzp acts cell-non-autonomously during the dorsal migration and cell-autonomously during the cell intercalation of the lateral mesendoderm (Fig. 3F). The phenotypes caused by the depletion of Kzp indicate that the Kzp protein has a critical function during zebrafish embryonic gastrulation. The fact that three zinc fingers at the N terminus of the Kzp protein (Kzp-ZFN) are homologous to DNA-binding domains within BTB/POZ proteins and Kaiso (supplemental Fig. S1) suggests that Kzp is a DNA-binding protein. To test this hypothesis, we performed a CAST assay (24.Wright W.E. Binder M. Funk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4104-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) using the bacterially expressed GST-Kzp-ZFN or GST-Kzp-ZFC fusion protein (Fig. 4A). The results showed that the Kzp zinc finger domains at the N terminus (Kzp-ZFN) of the protein bound to the 10-bp DNA fragment 5′-(t/a/g)t(a/t/g)nctgcca-3′ (referred to as the Kzp-binding site (Kzp-BS)) (Fig. 4B). Kzp-ZFC did not specifically bind to DNA (data not shown). Notably, the 5′-ctgcca-3′ sequence of the binding fragment was consistent in 41 sequenced clones that were derived from the Kzp-ZFN-based assays. In addition, we found that the 5′-tta-3′ sequence could be substituted with other nucleotides to some extent (Fig. 4B). To further characterize the DNA-binding specificity of Kzp, we performed EMSA competition experiments. As shown in Fig. 4C, shifted bands were observed when Kzp-BS and GST-Kzp-ZFN were incubated together but not when incubated with GST. Moreover, these complexes were diminished with the addition of excess unlabeled wild-type probe but not with a probe lacking the Kzp-BS. The binding specificity was also confirmed using EDTA as a zinc-chelating agent to abrogate the formation of the complex (Fig. 4C). In addition, to determine the nucleotide sequence that was sufficient for Kzp binding, a series of oligonucleotides with base substitutions within the Kzp-BS were synthesized and used in EMSA as competitors. The mut2 and mut3 oligonucleotides, which contained three base substitutions in the middle and 3′-regions of the Kzp-BS, respectively, did not compete for binding, and excess amounts of mut1, which contained three base substitutions in the 5′-region, retained competition ability (Fig. 4D), indicating that the 5′-ctgcca-3′ sequence of the Kzp-BS has a critic role in Kzp binding. Together, these results suggest that Kzp is a specific DNA-binding factor that may regulate gene expression in vivo. To assess the gene expression regulated by Kzp in zebrafish embryos, we performed a two-color cDNA microarray hybridization assay to compare the difference in expression of 15,000 DNA tags between embryos carrying either control MO or kzp MO at the shield stage (data not shown). The results showed that kzp MO caused a decrease in the expression of 1562 tags and an increase in the expression of 2371 tags. To verify the initial screening data, we performed RT-PCR and quantified the mRNA levels of 10 genes that were increased or decreased in the embryos in which Kzp levels were reduced. The mRNA levels detected by RT-PCR were consistent with the results of the cDNA profiles (Fig. 5A) except for wnt5 expression, suggesting that Kzp is able to control gene expression in zebrafish embryos. In the microarray data, we noted that wnt8 and its downstream target genes, including sp5l, cdx4, and tbx6, were dramatically down-regulated, which was consistent with the in situ hybridization results and was further confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 5A). In zebrafish, wnt8 signaling plays a key role in ventroposterior cell fate induction and tail outgrowth promotion (11.Thorpe C.J. Weidinger G. Moon R.T. Development. 2005; 132: 1763-1772Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Loss of function of the wnt8 locus by either mutation or MO injection results in a dorsalized phenotype that is characterized by an enlarged gastrula organizer and reduced tail structure (14.Lekven A.C. Thorpe C.J. Waxman J.S. Moon R.T. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Overexpression of wnt8 causes eyeless or headless phenotypes. The similarities in the phenotypic changes between the loss of Wnt8 and Kzp (supplemental Fig. S3) (14.Lekven A.C. Thorpe C.J. Waxman J.S. Moon R.T. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 103-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), together with the coherence of the down-regulated expression of wnt8 and its targets in Kzp-disrupted embryos, raised the possibility that wnt8 may be a Kzp target gene. To examine this hypothesis, we performed a time-lapse analysis of wnt8 expression in embryos injected with kzp MO by in situ hybridization. The wnt8 locus in zebrafish contains two transcripts, wnt8.1 and wnt8.2, and the wnt8.2 expression pattern overlaps with wnt8.1. Therefore, we first analyzed the expression pattern of the wnt8.2 transcript. In wild-type embryos, zygotic wnt8.2 expression started at the sphere stage (∼4 h post-fertilization) when the mRNA was located in the ventral portion of the blastula and yolk syncytial layer (Fig. 5B). However, the expression of wnt8.2 mRNA was dramatically reduced or even lost in kzp MO-injected embryos (73.3%, n = 45). We also observed a reduced expression of wnt8.2 mRNA in kzp morphants at the 30% epiboly, shield, and 80–90% epiboly stages (Fig. 5B). Similarly, kzp had the same effect on the transcription of wnt8.1 mRNA (Fig. 5D). In agreement with these data, the overexpression of kzp, by injection of either mRNA or DNA vectors, induced the ectopic expression of both wnt8 transcripts (Fig. 5, C and D). Therefore, these results suggest that Kzp is critical for the zygotic expression of both wnt8 transcripts. Previous studies have shown that FGF signals can induce the expression of mesodermal marker genes, including wnt8 and its downstream target genes (16.Hong C.S. Park B.Y."

The presence of nAChR at the NMJ during development depends on agrin, a heparan sulfate proteoglycan secreted by the presynaptic motor neuron (6Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Nat. Rev.

Agrin activates the muscle-specific tyrosine kinase MuSK through binding to its co-receptor LPR4 (8Kim N. Stiegler A.L. Cameron T.O. Hallock P.T. Gomez A.M. Huang J.H. Hubbard S.R. Dustin M.L.

Agrin and Wnt regulate the distribution of nAChR in the postsynaptic membrane by increasing receptor density in the NMJ and decreasing receptor density outside the NMJ (14Wang J. Ruan N.J. Qian L. Lei W.L. Chen F. Luo Z.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 21668-21675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). During these processes, rapsyn directs nAChR into contact with other NMJ proteins without altering channel function (15Fuhrer C. Gautam M. Sugiyama J.E. Hall Z.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6405-6416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rapsyn is also found at high concentrations together with nAChR in membranes of the electric organ of Torpedo (16Sobel A. Weber M. Changeux J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and in the developing neuromuscular synapse of Xenopus (7Burden S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 8270-8273Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The myristoylated N terminus of rapsyn targets the protein to the plasma membrane, where it participates in a number of important additional molecular interactions (17Phillips W.D. Maimone M.M. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1713-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). (i) Rapsyn self-associates through its seven tetratricopeptide repeats (18Ramarao M.K. Cohen J.B. Proc.

Brain. 2008; 1: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Failure in nAChR anchoring at the NMJ endplate causes defects in neuromuscular synaptic transmission, leading to severe myopathies (24Engel A.G. Ohno K. Sine S.M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 339-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanism of nAChR anchoring is therefore of importance for finding ways to treat muscular diseases. In general, membrane proteins reveal complex mobility patterns in living cells, including unrestricted (Brownian) diffusion, restricted diffusion within micrometer- to nanometer-sized membrane domains, or even totally immobile receptors (25Kusumi A. Nakada C. Ritchie K. Murase K. Suzuki K. Murakoshi H. Kasai R.S. Kondo J. Fujiwara T. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2005; 34: 351-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), the relative proportions of which can change substantially during biogenesis of a cell. Here, we investigated the mobility patterns and lateral diffusion of nAChR and its interacting protein rapsyn in muscle cells during different stages of differentiation to elucidate how rapsyn modulates nAChR. To address these questions, we use single-molecule imaging to follow the spatiotemporal distribution of nAChR in different cell lines and thus resolve mobility patterns, which would be undistinguishable when using ensemble measurements. Optical imaging requires labeling of the proteins of interest with fluorescent probes. Here, we approached this problem by labeling native nAChR with small fluorescent toxins, either reversibly with fluorescent α-conotoxin (2.7 kDa) (26Schreiter C. Gjoni M. Hovius R. Martinez K.L. Segura J.M. Vogel H. ChemBioChem. 2005; 6: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) or quasi-irreversibly with fluorescent α-bungarotoxin. This approach offers a substantial advantage working with native receptors instead of genetically engineered receptors fused either with fluorescent proteins (27Tsien R.Y. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 509-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (4982) Google Scholar) or with tags for post-translational labeling (28Keppler A. Pick H. Arrivoli C. Vogel H. Johnsson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9955-9959Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Myogenic cell lines C2C12 (a C2 myoblast) and R11 (a rapsyn−/− myoblast) were grown and differentiated to myotubes. C2C12 cells (obtained from U. Rüegg, University of Geneva) were grown in DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. R11 myoblasts (obtained from C. Fuhrer) (15Fuhrer C. Gautam M. Sugiyama J.E. Hall Z.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6405-6416Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 4 units/ml γ-interferon (Sigma). Cells were maintained at 34 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. For imaging, cells were seeded on 0.17-mm thick glass coverslips. Differentiation to myotubes was induced at 80% confluency by changing the medium to DMEM supplemented with 5% horse serum (Sigma) and growing at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. HEK 293T cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were plated on 25-mm diameter glass coverslips in a 30-mm diameter well and transfected 24 h later using Effectene (Qiagen) with cDNAs of nAChR subunits (60 ng of α-subunit, 30 ng of β-subunit, 30 ng of γ-subunit, and 30 ng of δ-subunit) and 30 ng of either enhanced GFP (Clontech) or rapsyn-GFP (generous gift from J. Cohen) (18Ramarao M.K. Cohen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 4007-4012Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Compared with enhanced GFP, this GFP has similar spectral properties but with two mutated residues (L65F and L231H). Single molecules were imaged on cells 24–48 h after transfection in colorless DMEM or Hanks' balanced salt solution (both from Invitrogen) without antibiotics and serum. nAChR in living cells were visualized using either α-conotoxin GI (α-CnTx) conjugated with organic fluorophores or α-bungarotoxin (α-BgTx) coupled to fluorescent semiconductor quantum dots (QD). Labeling of nAChR with α-CnTx conjugated with either Cy5 (GE Healthcare) or ATTO 647N (ATTO-TEC) was performed using the repetitive reversible labeling method described in detail previously (26Schreiter C. Gjoni M. Hovius R. Martinez K.L. Segura J.M. Vogel H. ChemBioChem. 2005; 6: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 29Guignet E.G. Segura J.M. Hovius R. Vogel H. ChemPhysChem. 2007; 8: 1221-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were perfused using a VC-77SP fast step perfusion system (Warner Instruments Corp.) for 10 s with 30 nm fluorescent α-CnTx labeling ∼1–5% of the nAChR expressed on the cell surface, followed by 20 s with Hanks' balanced salt solution, after which fluorescent image series were acquired. This sequence was repeated at will, enabling us to measure diffusion of a large number of individual receptors on one single cell repetitively despite fast bleaching of the organic dyes. Alternatively, streptavidin-coated fluorescent QD (kindly provided by M. Bäumle, Fluka) were incubated with α-BgTx-biotin (Sigma) at a ratio of one toxin molecule/two QD. Myoblasts were labeled with 500 pm α-BgTx-NP conjugates in DMEM for 60 min at 37 °C. Prior to microscopy measurements, the cells were rinsed three times in colorless DMEM to remove unbound probes. Glass coverslips were mounted on a modified epiluminescence wide-field microscope (Axiovert 200, Zeiss). Fluorescently labeled α-CnTx was excited with circularly polarized light at 632.8 nm (HeNe laser, Coherent Inc.) that was directed by a dichroic mirror (Q645LP, Chroma Corp.) into a water immersion objective (C-Apochromat 63×/W Korr, 1.2 numerical aperture, Zeiss) to illuminate a 22-μm diameter region of the sample. Fluorescence emission was collected by the same objective, passed through a filter (HQ710/100, Chroma Corp.), and imaged on an intensified CCD camera (Ixon 887BV, Andor). To minimize photobleaching of organic dyes, cells were illuminated for 50 ms with excitation intensities of 0.5 kilowatts/cm2 only during image acquisition using a shutter (LS3T2, Vincent Associates). Single-molecule images were recorded at a frequency of 4–20 Hz. Dissociation of α-CnTx from nAChR was much slower than photobleaching as described in detail previously (26Schreiter C. Gjoni M. Hovius R. Martinez K.L. Segura J.M. Vogel H. ChemBioChem. 2005; 6: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). α-BgTx-QD conjugates were excited at 488 nm (Ar+ laser, Innova Sabre). A circularly polarized laser beam was directed by a Q495LP dichroic mirror (Chroma Corp.) into the objective. Fluorescence emission was collected by the same objective and imaged after passing through a HQ595/50 dichroic filter (Chroma Corp.). Single-molecule images were recorded at a frequency of 20 Hz, illuminating the cells for 48.3 ms with excitation intensities of 0.1 kilowatts/cm2. Single-molecule trajectories were measured at the apical membrane of the cells to avoid unwanted effects of cell adhesion and fluorophore accumulation on the glass surface. Images were analyzed using a home-written IGOR Pro program (WaveMetrics). Each image was first filtered to remove long-range structures such as the laser intensity profile and autofluorescence of the cells. Next, fluorescent spots were identified on the filtered image. Fluorescent spots were then fitted with a two-dimensional Gaussian function on the original unfiltered image. Fitted fluorescent spots corresponding to single molecules were evaluated for intensity and tracked over a series of images to evaluate single-molecule trajectories. Characteristic one-step photobleaching or blinking events were taken as a criterion for selecting a single-molecule trace. Finally, square displacements (r2) were evaluated for every time interval of a single trajectory. Single-molecule traces were treated using two different strategies. Data sets of short traces resulting from experiments with organic dyes were evaluated according to Schütz et al. (30Schütz G.J. Schindler H. Schmidt T. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1073-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Briefly, the normalized cumulative probability density function (P(r2,tlag)) of r2 was evaluated for each time lag (tlag). This P(r2,tlag) was then fitted using Equation 1 or 2, yielding one or two average square displacements (r02), respectively.P(r2,tlag)=1−exp(r2r02(tlag))(Eq. 1) P(r2,tlag)=1−(α⋅exp(r2r12(tlag))+(1−α)⋅exp(r2r22(tlag)))(Eq. 2) In Equation 2, α is the fraction of the two average square displacements (r12 and r22) for each time lag. The diffusion coefficient (D) for each population is then deduced using a standard mean square displacement (MSD) versus tlag fit, according to Equations 3 and 4. Whenever possible, in longer trajectories, the apparent confinement length (Lc) and initial diffusion coefficient (D0) were also evaluated. D0 was determined from a linear fit of data points 2–4 of the plot of MSD versus tlag (Equation 3). This value was used to separate mobile and immobile receptors by setting a noise-dependent threshold. MSD plots of individual receptors were fitted using an approximation of a single molecule in a square, yielding an apparent D0 and Lc corresponding to the diagonal of a rectangle enclosing the diffusing object (Equation 4) (30Schütz G.J. Schindler H. Schmidt T. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1073-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 31Lommerse P.H. Snaar-Jagalska B.E. Spaink H.P. Schmidt T. J.

The noise term added in each equation is due to the noise of the CCD image and the movement of the particle during the acquisition time.MSD(tlag)=4⋅D0⋅tlag+noise(Eq. 3) MSD(tlag)=Lc23(1−exp(−12⋅D0⋅tlagLc2))+noise(Eq. 4) As the diffusion of a particle is a self-similar process, long single-molecule trajectories can be treated using the moment scaling spectrum (MSS). This method gives more accurate information about the type of motion and, as it involves only linear fits, avoids errors arising from complex multiparameter fits (33Ewers H. Smith A.E. Sbalzarini I.F. Lilie H. Koumoutsakos P. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15110-15115Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 34Ferrari R. Manfroi A. Young W. Physica D. 2001; 154: 111-137Crossref Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The MSS slope is a single parameter that allows us to distinguish between anomalous, directed, and confined diffusion: a slope of 0.5 defines Brownian motion; values <0.5 and >0 are characteristic of confined motion; values equal to zero indicate immobility; and values >0.5 describe directed diffusion (33Ewers H. Smith A.E. Sbalzarini I.F. Lilie H. Koumoutsakos P. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15110-15115Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Each MMS slope was computed using a sliding window of 60 frames. C2C12 muscle cells differentiate into functional myotubes within 5 days after the addition of 5% horse serum to the cell culture medium. Diffusion of nAChR in the cell plasma membrane was measured by single-receptor tracking before and 2, 3, 5, 8, and 11 days after induction of differentiation. During this time period, significant changes were observed in the membrane distribution of nAChR, visualized by receptor-bound fluorescent toxins (Fig. 1). Before differentiation, nAChR was homogeneously distributed in the membrane (Fig. 1E). The same homogeneous distribution was observed still after 2 days (Fig. 1F). Mononucleated cells began to align after 3 days, and dense receptor clusters became visible at the cell membrane even in the absence of presynaptically secreted agrin (Fig. 1G). After 5 days, when most of the cells were fused to multinucleated cells and began to form myotubes, dense clusters of nAChR appeared (Fig. 1H). Three different populations of nAChR were observed in the plasma membrane of muscle cells: immobile, confined, and freely diffusing receptors. Fig. 2 depicts representative plots of MSD versus tlag of single-receptor trajectories. For Brownian diffusion, MSD is linearly dependent on time; deviations from linearity indicate non-ideal diffusion (35Saxton M.J. Jacobson K. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 373-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1481) Google Scholar). Here, we characterized the trajectories of individual nAChR according to two parameters: (i) the initial D0 of the receptor and (ii) the Lc of its confinement region. The value of D0 was used to distinguish between mobile and immobile receptors, and that of Lc was used to discriminate confined (Lc < 280 nm) from freely diffusing receptors. Individual nAChR were visualized after binding of α-CnTx covalently labeled with the fluorescent probe Cy5, yielding single-receptor trajectories of up to 40 frames acquired at 4 Hz. Single-receptor trajectories were measured using cells at three different states of development: before induction (undifferentiated myoblasts), during differentiation (days 2, 3, and 5), and after differentiation (multinucleated myotubes at days 8 and 11) (Fig. 2). Before differentiation, only 2% of the receptors showed free Brownian diffusion, 24% diffused in confined regions, and 74% were immobile. During differentiation and cell fusion, the immobile receptor fraction increased slightly without a significant effect on the two other types of receptor mobility. However, in differentiated multinucleated cells, the proportion of immobile receptors decreased strongly, with a concomitant increase in the fraction of confined diffusing receptors from 20 to 34% and of freely diffusing receptors up to 10%. At all times, the majority (>60%) of the confined receptors were located in domains with Lc < 100 nm. To investigate the direct effect of rapsyn on receptor mobility, trajectories of individual nAChR were measured on R11 rapsyn−/− mouse muscle cells, which are devoid of rapsyn (both alleles are inactivated). Because R11 muscle cells are difficult to differentiate into multinucleated myotubes, comparative experiments were carried on myoblasts. Single-receptor trajectories of superior quality were obtained using toxins labeled with fluorescent probes of increased photostability (α-BgTx-NP and α-CnTx-ATTO 647N), yielding extremely long trajectories of up to 5 min (6000 frames at 20 Hz). For most experiments, however, we measured only up to 300 frames to reduce phototoxicity. The average lengths of the traces for C2C12 and R11 cells were 254 and 159 frames, respectively, due to trace interruption by blinking and bleaching. The yet substantially improved quality of the MSD versus tlag plots allowed us to determine particular D0 and Lc values with considerably increased accuracy. Moreover, the long traces allowed us to use the MSS data evaluation method (33Ewers H. Smith A.E. Sbalzarini I.F. Lilie H. Koumoutsakos P. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15110-15115Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) to unequivocally classify the type of mobility for single trajectories (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 3 shows the resulting graphs of MSS slope versus D0. There was a shift from immobile and confined receptors in the presence of rapsyn (0 < MSS slope < 0.4) to confined and freely mobile receptors in the absence of rapsyn (0.1 < MSS slope < 0.8). The median size of the observed confinement regions increased from 46 nm for C2C12 cells to 117 nm for R11 cells. Moreover, in the absence of rapsyn, the mobility of nAChR strongly increased as determined by D0. Despite the considerably long duration of the trajectories of up to 100 s, not a single case was observed in which an initially immobile or confined molecule switched to Brownian diffusion. However, some of the apparently freely diffusing receptors exhibited transient clustering. Fig. 4 shows one of the initially freely diffusing receptors being transiently trapped in domains, featuring transitions between free and confined motion and immobility. In muscle cells, many different proteins participate in scaffolding nAChR within the NMJ. To investigate the interaction between nAChR and rapsyn in the cell plasma membrane in the absence of other components of the NMJ, we expressed the proteins heterologously in HEK 293T cells. This cell line has been used as a neutral background to study the interaction between rapsyn and nAChR (36Ohno K. Engel A.G. Shen X.M. Selcen D. Brengman J. Harper C.M. Tsujino A. Milone M. Am. J.

Beeson D. Lochmüller H. Abicht A. Brain. 2006; 129: 2784-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and no mRNA encoding rapsyn was detected (38Kasai Y. Hashimoto S. Yamada T. Sese J. Sugano S. Matsushima K. Morishita S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: D550-D552Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The mobility of nAChR was investigated under two different conditions: cells were transfected with cDNA of nAChR subunits together with either rapsyn-GFP or, as a control, cytosolic enhanced GFP. As before (Fig. 1), receptor mobility was classified into three categories according to the same criteria. Upon expression of only nAChR in HEK 293T cells, we could not observe immobile receptors (Fig. 5). Mobile receptors were distinguished as those featuring Brownian or confined diffusion according to a cumulative distribution analysis (30Schütz G.J. Schindler H. Schmidt T. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1073-1080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 31Lommerse P.H. Snaar-Jagalska B.E. Spaink H.P. Schmidt T. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1799-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Freely diffusing (55 ± 2%) nAChR had a D0 of 0.043 ± 0.002 μm2/s; those showing confined diffusion were characterized by an initial D0 of 0.016 ± 0.005 μm2/s and a domain size of Lc = 320 ± 20 nm. Cotransfection of rapsyn-GFP and nAChR plasmids at a 1:1 molar ratio in HEK cells led to the formation of dense rapsyn clusters at the cell membrane (Fig. 5C). Very strikingly, we observed a large population of immobile receptors (19%) with D0 < 0.005 μm2/s, a decreased population of freely diffusing receptors (53%), and a virtually unchanged fraction of receptors with confined diffusion (28%) with slightly increased Lc from 322 ± 21 to 377 ± 33 nm (p < 0.001) compared with the absence of GFP-rapsyn. The low proportion of labeled nAChR used for each image series did neither allow us to detect clusters of receptors nor to identify regions on the cell membrane of restricted nAChR diffusion. For imaging individual receptors on the cell surface, we developed two complementary staining procedures. (i) Using fluorescent α-CnTx, we could stain nAChR on the surface of myotubes both inside receptor clusters, i.e. in regions of high receptor density, and in membrane areas featuring low receptor density. The binding of fluorescent α-CnTx could be reversed, allowing sequential restaining (26Schreiter C. Gjoni M. Hovius R. Martinez K.L. Segura J.M. Vogel H. ChemBioChem. 2005; 6: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This yielded a large number of trajectories of single receptors, sampling many different receptors on the same cell, and thus improved substantially the reliability of determining the mobility of the receptors. (ii) Staining nAChR with virtually irreversibly bound α-BgTx-NP conjugates made it possible to acquire very long traces, revealing changes in the diffusion modes of nAChR. Because C2C12 mouse myoblasts form postsynaptic-like structures after differentiation (39Gajsek N. Jevsek M. Mars T. Mis K. Pirkmajer S. Brecelj J. Grubic Z. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2008; 175: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we selected them as a model system to study receptor mobility in synapses. In undifferentiated C2C12 cells, no nAChR clusters were resolved, although ∼70% of the receptors were immobile. Clusters of nAChR and rapsyn did appear only after 2 days of incubation in the differentiating culture medium, still before fusion of myoblasts to myotubes. The mobility of the receptors did not change until the cells became multinucleated, whereby the fraction of mobile receptors increased. This might be explained by the observation that during differentiation, although the rapsyn level remains constant, the expression of nAChR subunits increases, i.e. the rapsyn/nAChR ratio decreases (40Frail D.E. Musil L.S. Buonanno A. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1077-1086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). On the other hand, an increasing rapsyn versus nAChR concentration is known to slow down receptor turnover (41Gervásio O.L. Phillips W.D. J. Physiol. 2005; 562: 673-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), which corroborates our finding that the nAChR mobility is lower in undifferentiated than in differentiated C2C12 cells. Our results suggest that individual nAChR are released from receptor-dense regions to move freely in the surrounding membrane bulk phase. Such a release could be important either for receptor recycling or for serving as a reservoir of receptors, outside the synapses. The rate of change in nAChR mobility was quantified by calculating kchange = (number of changes)/(total measurement time). The rather short (few seconds) single-molecule trajectories obtained using α-CnTx labeled with organic fluorophores did not feature any change in receptor mobility within any of the evaluated 292 traces (kchange < 2 × 10−3 s−1), implying that the receptors remain in a particular state. Long trajectories (tens of seconds) obtained with the photostable α-BgTx-NP conjugates showed a similar behavior. The low switching rate (kchange < 3 × 10−4 s−1) could contribute to the stability of the NMJ. From heterologously expressed nAChR in HEK cells devoid of rapsyn, only a few receptors (<1%) were immobile, whereas heterologously expressed rapsyn in HEK cells resulted in the appearance of a large fraction of immobilized nAChR (Fig. 5). These results confirmed that rapsyn alone can immobilize nAChR and induce small but significant increases in Lc. In contrast, muscle cells feature a very large fraction of immobile receptors. Throughout differentiation, a substantial fraction of receptor diffused in confined regions (Fig. 2A). Thus, confinement of nAChR is not directly related to an increased expression of muscle-specific proteins associated with myotube formation and could be due to direct interactions of the receptor with the plasma membrane (42Barrantes F.J. Bermudez V. Borroni M.V. Antollini S.S. Pediconi M.F. Baier J.C. Bonini I. Gallegos C. Roccamo A.M. Valles A.S. Ayala V. Kamerbeek C. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2010; 40: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Immobile or strongly confined receptors were also found outside of nAChR clusters in C2C12 muscle cells. This observation suggests that not all complexes between rapsyn and nAChR are recruited in clusters in neuronal myotubes. Whereas rapsyn forms dense domains at the cell membrane of myoblasts (Fig. 5), nAChR does not. However, nAChR is known to cluster in differentiated muscle cells. There are two possible explanations for these observations in myoblasts. (i) Receptors are present at such a low concentration that they are homogeneously distributed over the entire rapsyn-covered membrane domains. (ii) Apparently, the signals inducing clustering in differentiated cells are not present in myoblasts. The absence of nAChR clustering in HEK cells can be explained by its low expression upon transient transfection (<1000 copies/cell) (26Schreiter C. Gjoni M. Hovius R. Martinez K.L. Segura J.M. Vogel H. ChemBioChem. 2005; 6: 2187-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We have observed receptors diffusing in confined domains in both rapsyn+/+ and rapsyn−/− myoblasts, indicating rapsyn-independent recruitment of nAChR in muscle cells with smaller Lc if rapsyn was present. Elsewhere, 50-nm membrane domains of nAChR have been observed by stimulated emission depletion microscopy in chemically fixed CHO cells (43Kellner R.R. Baier C.J. Willig K.I. Hell S.W. Barrantes F.J. Neuroscience. 2007; 144: 135-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the presence of a sufficient amount of rapsyn, nearly all formerly diffusing receptors were finally immobilized (Fig. 3). The existence of very stable, receptor-rich domains in the plasma membrane might be due to endocytosis. nAChR colocalizes with caveolin-3, a major functional component of caveolae involved in agrin-induced clustering of nAChR (44Stetzkowski-Marden F.

The values for Lc found here are comparable with the dimensions of 25–100 nm reported previously for caveolae (45Allen J.A. Halverson-Tamboli R.A. Rasenick M.M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 8: 128-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The small number of immobile receptors observed in R11 cells suggests the existence of a less efficient, rapsyn-independent mechanism of receptor immobilization. The long time of >15 s that the receptors remained immobilized (>300 frames) in our study is not fully comparable with transient receptor recruitment occurring in 50-nm membrane domains within the range of 0.5 s reported by Suzuki et al. (47Suzuki K.G. Fujiwara T.K. Sanematsu F. Iino R. Edidin M. Kusumi A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Specific, long lasting interactions with cytoskeleton components could explain our findings. The very rare, transient recruitment events of nAChR, shown in Fig. 4, could be due to hindered diffusion in the cell plasma membrane (25Kusumi A. Nakada C. Ritchie K. Murase K. Suzuki K. Murakoshi H. Kasai R.S. Kondo J. Fujiwara T. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2005; 34: 351-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar), transient interactions with other components (48Suzuki K.G. Fujiwara T.K. Edidin M. Kusumi A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 731-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), or recruitment in short-living membrane domains (49Meier J. Vannier C. Sergé A. Triller A. Choquet D. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). nAChR is claimed to partition into cholesterol-rich membrane domains after agrin activation (50Pato C. Stetzkowski-Marden F. Gaus K. Recouvreur M. Cartaud A. Cartaud J. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2008; 175: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The transient immobilization events observed here might stem from short-living membrane domains. Our single-receptor tracking experiments yielded a complex mobility pattern of muscle-type nAChR in the plasma membrane of different cell types: the presence of rapsyn increases the number of immobilized receptors and changes the size of the confinement for both the nAChR at natural abundance in muscle cells and the heterologously expressed nAChR in HEK cells. In muscle cells devoid of rapsyn, a fraction of nAChR remains immobilized and confined by an unknown mechanism. Single-receptor imaging also revealed the existence of small membrane regions comprising confined nAChR that are not related to large receptor clusters associated with rapsyn: the small confinement regions may serve as a complementary regulatory means for receptor store and release."

No significant reduction in viral protease expression or viral growth was observed in cells that either did not express an EGS or produced a “disabled” EGS, which carried nucleotide mutations that precluded RNase P recognition.

Using an in vitro selection procedure, we have previously isolated novel EGS variants that direct RNase P to cleave TK mRNA in vitro more efficiently than those derived from a natural tRNA sequence (18Zhou T.

Little is currently known about how these EGS RNA variants increase their activity in directing RNase P to cleave a target mRNA. It has not been extensively studied whether selected EGS RNA variants are more effective in blocking gene expression in cultured cells than those derived from a natural tRNA sequence. In this study, one of these EGS variants was used to construct EGS PR-C125 that targets the mRNA encoding the protease (PR) of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (19Mocarski E.S. Shenk T. Pass R.F. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Martin M.A. Lamb R.A. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2007: 2701-2772Google Scholar), and the activity of the EGS in blocking viral PR expression and growth in cultured cells was examined. HCMV, a human herpesvirus, is the leading cause of congenital infections associated with mental retardation in newborns and causes serious clinical manifestations in the immunocompromised population such as AIDS patients (19Mocarski E.S. Shenk T. Pass R.F. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Martin M.A. Lamb R.A. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2007: 2701-2772Google Scholar). Development of effective antiviral compounds and approaches is central for the treatment and prevention of infections by HCMV as well as other herpesviruses. HCMV PR is highly conserved among herpesviruses (20Welch A.R. Woods A.S. McNally L.M. Cotter R.J. Gibson W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 10792-10796Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and is essential for viral capsid formation and replication (21Dunn W. Chou C. Li H. Hai R. Patterson D. Stolc V. Zhu H.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 7103-7108Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, PR may serve as a target for novel drug development to combat HCMV and other herpesvirus infections (19Mocarski E.S. Shenk T. Pass R.F. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Martin M.A. Lamb R.A. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Fields Virology. Lippincott-Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2007: 2701-2772Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated activity of the EGS variant PR-C125 in inducing RNase P to cleave the target PR mRNA and its efficacy in blocking HCMV gene expression and growth in cultured cells. We showed that PR-C125 was about 35-fold more active in directing RNase P to cleave the target mRNA than PR-SER, the EGS derived from a natural tRNA sequence. When expressed in cultured cells that were infected by HCMV, PR-C125 was more effective in inhibiting viral gene expression and growth than PR-SER. A reduction of more than 95% in the PR expression and an inhibition of at least 4,000-fold were observed in cells that expressed PR-C125. In contrast, a reduction of less than 10% in viral gene expression and growth was observed in cells that either did not express an EGS or expressed EGSs that contained point mutations abolishing their ability to induce RNase P-mediated cleavage. Our results provide direct evidence that engineered EGS RNAs are highly effective in blocking HCMV PR expression and growth. These results also demonstrate the feasibility of developing highly active EGSs as a novel class of antiviral agents for treatment of human viral diseases. HCMV (strain AD169) was propagated in human foreskin fibroblasts and astrocytoma U373MG cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The anti-rabbit polyclonal antibodies against HCMV protease were kindly provided by Annette Meyer, Pfizer, Inc. (Ann Arbor, MI), and John Wu of Promab, Inc. (Albany, CA). The monoclonal antibodies c1201, c1202, and c1203, which react with HCMV proteins gB, UL44, and IE2, were purchased from the Goodwin Institute for Cancer Research (Plantation, FL). The monoclonal antibodies against gH and human actin were purchased from Biodesign Inc. (Kennebunk, Maine) and Sigma, respectively. The DNA sequence coding for EGS PR-SER was generated by PCR using construct pTK112 (15Kawa D. Wang J. Yuan Y. Liu F. RNA. 1998; 4: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) as the template with 5′ primer oligoPR31 (5′-GGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGTTAACGCGCCGGGTGCGGTCTCC-3′) and 3′ primer oligoPR32 (5′-AAGCTTTAAATGCTCTCCGCAGGATTTGAACCTGCGCGCG-3′). The DNA sequence coding for PR-C125 was generated by PCR using construct Ptkc125 (18Zhou T. Kim J. Kilani A.F. Kim K. Dunn W. Jo S. Nepomuceno E. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30112-30120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) as the template with the 5′ primer oligoPR41 (5′-GGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGTTAACGCGCCGGGCAGCTACTAGCAG-3′) and 3′ primer oligoPR42 (5′-AAGCTTTAAATGCTCTCCGCAGGCTCCGAACTGCTAGTAG-3′). The DNA sequences coding for EGS PR-SER-C and PR-C125-C were derived from those for PR-SER and PR-C125, respectively, and contained point mutations (5′-TTC-3′ → AAG) at the three highly conserved positions in the T-loop of these EGSs (Fig. 1, C and D). The DNA sequence that encodes substrate pr39 was constructed by annealing oligonucleotide AF25 (5′-GGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAG-3′) and sPR (5′-CGGGATCCGCAGCGCCGGCTGGAGAGCGAGAGGCCGGCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′). RNA substrate pr39 and EGS RNAs were synthesized in vitro from the constructed DNA templates using T7 RNA polymerase. Human RNase P was prepared from HeLa cellular extracts as described previously (12Yuan Y. Hwang E.S. Altman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 8006-8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 15Kawa D. Wang J. Yuan Y. Liu F. RNA. 1998; 4: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Zhou T. Kim J. Kilani A.F.

The EGSs and 32P-labeled pr39 were incubated with human RNase P at 37 °C in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NH4Cl, and 10 mm MgCl2). Cleavage products were separated in denaturing gels and analyzed with a STORM840 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Assays to determine kinetic parameters were performed under multiple turnover conditions, as described previously (18Zhou T. Kim J. Kilani A.F. Kim K. Dunn W. Jo S. Nepomuceno E. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30112-30120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 23Yuan Y. Altman S. Science. 1994; 263: 1269-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In brief, the cleavage of substrates was assayed in buffer A at various concentrations of substrates, both above and below the Km for the substrate. The amount of substrates was in large excess to that of the enzymes to assure that saturation with the substrate was achieved in the multiple turnover conditions. Aliquots were withdrawn from reaction mixtures at regular intervals and analyzed in polyacrylamide/urea gels, and the values of Km(app) and Vmax(app) were obtained from Lineweaver-Burk double-reciprocal plots (18Zhou T.

Science. 1994; 263: 1269-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The procedures to measure the equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd) of complexes of the EGSs and the substrates were modified from Pyle et al. (24Pyle A.M. McSwiggen J.A. Cech T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 8187-8191Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In brief, using a gel shift approach, various concentrations of EGSs were preincubated in buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 3% glycerol, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) for 10 min before mixing with an equal volume of different concentrations of substrate RNA preheated under identical conditions. The samples were incubated for 10–30 min to allow binding, then loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel, and run at 10 watts. The electrophoresis running buffer contained 100 mm Tris/Hepes, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2 (24Pyle A.M. McSwiggen J.A. Cech T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 8187-8191Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The value of Kd was then extrapolated from a graph plotting the percent of product bound versus EGS concentration (18Zhou T. Kim J. Kilani A.F. Kim K. Dunn W. Jo S. Nepomuceno E. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30112-30120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The values were the average of three experiments. The protocols for the construction of U373MG cells expressing different EGSs were modified from Miller and Rosman (25Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-990PubMed Google Scholar) and have been described previously (26Trang P. Lee M. Nepomuceno E. Kim J. Zhu H. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In brief, amphotropic PA317 cells were transfected with retroviral vector DNAs (LXSN-PR-SER, LXSN-PR-SER-C, LXSN-PR-C125, LXSN-PR-C125-C, and LXSN-TK112). Forty-eight hours post-transfection, culture supernatants that contained retroviral vectors were collected and used to infect U373MG cells. At 48–72 h postinfection, cells were incubated in culture medium that contained 600 μg/ml of neomycin. Cells were subsequently selected in the presence of neomycin for 2 weeks and neomycin-resistant cells were cloned. For Northern analyses of the expression of the EGSs, both nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA fractions from EGS-expressing cells were isolated as described previously (15Kawa D. Wang J. Yuan Y. Liu F. RNA. 1998; 4: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Trang P. Lee M. Nepomuceno E. Kim J. Zhu H. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The RNA fractions were separated in a 2.5% agarose gel that contained formaldehyde, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, hybridized with the 32P-radiolabeled DNA probes that contained the DNA sequences coding for PR-SER, PR-C125, and H1 RNA, and finally analyzed with a STORM840 PhosphorImager. Cells (n = 1 × 106) were either mock-infected or infected with HCMV at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.5–5 in an inoculum of 1.5 ml of DMEM supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum. The inoculum was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum after 2 h incubation with cells. The infected cells were incubated for 4–72 h before harvesting for isolation of viral mRNA or protein. To measure the levels of viral immediate-early (IE) transcripts, some of cells were also treated with 100 μg/ml of cycloheximide prior to and during infection. RNA samples and protein extracts were prepared from the cells as described previously (15Kawa D. Wang J. Yuan Y. Liu F. RNA. 1998; 4: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Trang P. Lee M. Nepomuceno E. Kim J. Zhu H. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For detection of viral mRNAs, the RNA fractions were separated in 1% agarose gels that contained formaldehyde, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, hybridized with the 32P-radiolabeled DNA probes that contained the HCMV DNA sequences, and analyzed with a STORM840 PhosphorImager. The DNA probes used to detect human H1 RNA, HCMV immediate-early 5-kb RNA transcript, PR mRNA, IE1 mRNA, and US2 mRNA were synthesized from plasmids pH1, pCig27, pPR, pIE1, and pCig38, respectively. For Western analyses, the polypeptides from cell lysates were separated on either SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gels or SDS-9% polyacrylamide gels cross-linked with N,N“-methylenebisacylamide, transferred electrically to nitrocellulose membranes, and reacted to the antibodies against HCMV proteins and human actin. The proteins on the membranes were stained subsequently using a Western chemiluminescent substrate kit and quantitated with a STORM840 PhosphorImager, as described previously (15Kawa D. Wang J. Yuan Y. Liu F. RNA. 1998; 4: 1397-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Trang P. Lee M. Nepomuceno E. Kim J. Zhu H. Liu F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 5812-5817Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To determine the level of the inhibition of viral growth, cells (n = 1 × 105) were infected with HCMV. The m.o.i. is specified under “Results.” The cells and medium were harvested at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 days postinfection and viral stocks were prepared by adding an equal volume of 10% (v/v) skim milk, followed by sonication. The titers of the viral stocks were determined by infecting 1 × 105 human foreskin fibroblasts and counting the number of plaques 10–14 days after infection. The values obtained were averages from triplicate experiments. Viral DNA was detected by PCR amplification of the viral immediate-early IE1 sequence, using the human β-actin sequence as the internal control. The 5′ and 3′ primers for detecting the IE1 sequence were CMV3 (5′-CCAAGCGGCCTCTGATAACCAAGCC-3′) and CMV4 (5′-CAGCACCATCCTCCTCTTCCTCTGG-3′), respectively (27Wang J. Jiang H. Liu F. RNA. 2000; 6: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The 5′ and 3′ primers used to amplify the actin sequence were Actin5 (5′-TGACGGGGTCACCCACACTGTGCCCATCTA-3′) and Actin3 (5′-CTAGAAGCATTGCGGTGGCAGATGGAGGG-3′), respectively (28Daftarian P.M. Kumar A. Kryworuchko M. Diaz-Mitoma F. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 12-20PubMed Google Scholar). PCR cycles and other conditions were optimized to assure that the amplification was within the linear range. To obtain the PCR DNA template, 5 × 105 cells grown on 6-well plates were mock-infected or infected with HCMV. After a 1.5-h incubation at 37 °C, the inoculum was removed and the cells were further incubated and harvested at 72–96 h postinfection. Total and encapsidated (DNase I-treated) DNAs were isolated essentially as described (29Matusick-Kumar L. Hurlburt W. Weinheimer S.P. Newcomb W.W. Brown J.C. Gao M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5384-5394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and used as the PCR DNA templates. The PCR consisted of 20 cycles with denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, followed by primer annealing at 47 °C for 1 min and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. The last cycle was again an extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The amplified HCMV DNA (481 bp) and actin sequence (610 bp) were separated on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. The PCR were carried out in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. The radiolabeled DNA samples separated on polyacrylamide gels were scanned with a STORM840 PhosphorImager. We also generated a standard (dilution) curve by amplifying different dilutions of the template DNA. The plot of counts for both HCMV and β-actin versus dilutions of DNA did not reach a plateau for the saturation curve (data not shown) under the conditions described above, indicating that quantitation of viral DNA could be accomplished. The PCR results were derived from three independent experiments. Because most intracellular RNAs are associated with proteins and are present in highly organized and folded conformations, choosing a target region of the PR mRNA that is accessible to binding by the EGS is critical to achieve optimal cleavage. We used an in vivo mapping approach with dimethyl sulfate (30Zaug A.J. Cech T.R. RNA. 1995; 1: 363-374PubMed Google Scholar, 31Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) to determine the accessible regions of the PR mRNA. A position 359 nucleotides downstream from the translational initiation codon was chosen as the cleavage site for human RNase P. This site appeared to be one of the regions most accessible to dimethyl sulfate modification and is likely accessible to EGS binding (data not shown). We have previously employed an in vitro selection procedure to isolate EGS RNA variants that are more efficient in directing human RNase P for cleavage of the TK mRNA sequence than the EGS derived from a natural tRNA sequence (18Zhou T. Kim J. Kilani A.F. Kim K. Dunn W. Jo S. Nepomuceno E. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30112-30120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The objective of the study was to generate active EGS variants that can be used to target an mRNA, and to study the variants to understand the mechanism of how EGS RNAs efficiently direct RNase P for cleavage of an mRNA substrate. However, little is currently known about how some of these active EGS variants increase their activity in directing RNase P-mediated cleavage in vitro. We chose variant C125 for this study because the EGS RNAs derived from this variant are among the most active EGSs in inducing RNase P to cleave the TK as well as the PR mRNA sequences in vitro (see below, Table 1). By covalently linking the EGS domain of C125 to the targeting sequences that are complementary to the PR mRNA, we constructed EGS PR-C125, which resembles part of a tRNA structure and contains a T-loop, a T-stem, and a variable region but not the anticodon region that is dispensable for EGS activity (Fig. 1D) (23Yuan Y. Altman S. Science. 1994; 263: 1269-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Another EGS, PR-SER, which was derived from the natural tRNASer sequence, was also constructed in a similar way and included in the study (Fig. 1C). EGS RNAs were synthesized in vitro from the DNA sequences coding the EGSs by T7 RNA polymerase and subsequently incubated with human RNase P and substrate pr39, which contained a PR mRNA sequence of 39 nucleotides. RNase P-mediated cleavage of the substrate was observed in the presence of PR-SER and PR-C125 (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, no cleavage of pr39 by RNase P was observed in the absence of these EGSs (Fig. 2, lane 4). Thus, PR-SER and PR-C125 efficiently directed human RNase P to cleave the PR mRNA sequence in vitro.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters (Vmax(app), Km(app), and Vmax(app)/Km(app)) in the RNase P cleavage of ptRNASer or pr39 in the presence of different EGSsSubstrateKmVmax(app)Vmax(app)/Km(app)Kdμmpmol min−1pmol μm−1 min−1μmptRNASer0.015 ± 0.0030.045 ± 0.0153.0 ± 0.6PR mRNA(pr39)+PR-SER0.55 ± 0.100.030 ± 0.0100.055 ± 0.0201.3 ± 0.3+PR-SER-CNDaND, not determined.ND<0.0011.2 ± 0.3+PR-C1250.40 ± 0.090.80 ± 0.202.0 ± 0.40.030 ± 0.005+PR-C125-CNDND<0.0010.032 ± 0.006a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab To further study the activity of the EGS in inducing RNase P to cleave the PR mRNA sequence in vitro, we carried out detailed kinetic analyses for the reactions in the presence of different EGSs, and determined the values of Km(app) and Vmax(app) as well as the overall cleavage efficiency (Vmax(app)/Km(app)) for the cleavage reactions. PR-C125 was highly efficient in directing human RNase P to cleave pr39 and was at least 35-fold more active than PR-SER (Table 1). An increase in the cleavage rate of RNase P may be due to additional tertiary interactions that potentially stabilize the mRNA-EGS complex. If this is the case, the binding affinity of the EGS variant (i.e. PR-C125) to the PR mRNA sequence may be better than that of the EGS (i.e. PR-SER) derived from the natural tRNA sequence. Using gel-shift assays for separating substrate-EGS complexes in polyacrylamide gels under non-denaturing conditions, we measured the dissociation constant (Kd) to determine the binding affinities of EGS PR-C125 and PR-SER to substrate pr39. PR-C125 exhibited about 40 times higher binding affinity to pr39 than PR-SER (Table 1). Because both PR-C125 and PR-SER have the same antisense sequences to pr39 (Fig. 1, C and D), these results suggest that the increased binding affinity and the stability of the substrate-EGS complex in the presence of PR-C125 is probably due to the additional tertiary interactions introduced by this EGS. The DNA sequences coding for PR-C125 and PR-SER were subcloned into retroviral vector LXSN and placed under control of the small nuclear U6 RNA promoter (12Yuan Y. Hwang E.S. Altman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 8006-8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 31Liu F. Altman S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 32Bertrand E. Castanotto D. Zhou C. Carbonnelle C. Lee N.S. Good P. Chatterjee S. Grange T. Pictet R. Kohn D. Engelke D. Rossi J.J. RNA. 1997; 3: 75-88PubMed Google Scholar). This promoter, which has previously been shown to express EGS RNA and other RNAs steadily, is transcribed by RNA polymerase III, and its transcripts are highly expressed and primarily localized in the nucleus (12Yuan Y. Hwang E.S. Altman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 8006-8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 31Liu F. Altman S.

Rossi J.J. RNA. 1997; 3: 75-88PubMed Google Scholar). Two additional EGSs, PR-C125-C and PR-SER-C, were also constructed and cloned under the control of the U6 RNA promoter. PR-C125-C and PR-SER-C were derived from PR-C125 and PR-SER, respectively, and contained base substitutions (5′-UUC-3′ → AAG) at the three highly conserved positions in the T-loop of these EGSs (Fig. 1, C and D). Previous studies have shown that these nucleotides were found in most of the known natural tRNA sequences (33Jühling F. Mörl M. Hartmann R.K. Sprinzl M. Stadler P.F. Pütz J.

https://openalex.org/W2002211229,"A nucleotide-induced change in DNA polymerase structure governs the kinetics of polymerization by high fidelity DNA polymerases. Mutation of a GAG hinge (G542A/G544A) in T7 DNA polymerase resulted in a 1000-fold slower rate of conformational change, which then limited the rate of correct nucleotide incorporation. Rates of misincorporation were comparable to that seen for wild-type enzyme so that the net effect of the mutation was a large decrease in fidelity. We demonstrate that a presumably modest change from glycine to alanine 20 Å from the active site can severely restrict the flexibility of the enzyme structure needed to recognize and incorporate correct substrates with high specificity. These results emphasize the importance of the substrate-induced conformational change in governing nucleotide selectivity by accelerating the incorporation of correct base pairs but not mismatches."
https://openalex.org/W2059087441,"The ability to respond to adverse environments effectively along with the ability to reproduce are sine qua non conditions for all sustainable cellular forms of life. Given the availability of an appropriate sensing modality, the ubiquity and immediacy of the stress response could form the basis for a new approach for rapid biological testing. We have found that measuring the dielectric permittivity of a cellular suspension, an easily measurable electronic property, is an effective way to monitor the response of bacterial cells to adverse conditions continuously. The dielectric permittivity of susceptible and resistant strains of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, treated with gentamicin and vancomycin, were measured directly using differential impedance sensing methods and expressed as the Normalized Impedance Response (NIR). These same strains were also heat-shocked and chemically stressed with Triton X-100 or H(2)O(2). The NIR profiles obtained for antibiotic-treated susceptible organisms showed a strong and continuous decrease in value. In addition, the intensity of the NIR value decrease for susceptible cells varied in proportion to the amount of antibiotic added. Qualitatively similar profiles were found for the chemically treated and heat-shocked bacteria. In contrast, antibiotic-resistant cells showed no change in the NIR values in the presence of the drug to which it is resistant. The data presented here show that changes in the dielectric permittivity of a cell suspension are directly correlated with the development of a stress response as well as bacterial recovery from stressful conditions. The availability of a practical sensing modality capable of monitoring changes in the dielectric properties of stressed cells could have wide applications in areas ranging from the detection of bacterial infections in clinical specimens to antibiotic susceptibility testing and drug discovery."
