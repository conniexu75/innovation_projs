https://openalex.org/W2016823790,"Recent studies have suggested that bone marrow cells possess a broad differentiation potential, being able to form new liver cells, cardiomyocytes and neurons. Several groups have attributed this apparent plasticity to 'transdifferentiation'. Others, however, have suggested that cell fusion could explain these results. Using a simple method based on Cre/lox recombination to detect cell fusion events, we demonstrate that bone-marrow-derived cells (BMDCs) fuse spontaneously with neural progenitors in vitro. Furthermore, bone marrow transplantation demonstrates that BMDCs fuse in vivo with hepatocytes in liver, Purkinje neurons in the brain and cardiac muscle in the heart, resulting in the formation of multinucleated cells. No evidence of transdifferentiation without fusion was observed in these tissues. These observations provide the first in vivo evidence for cell fusion of BMDCs with neurons and cardiomyocytes, raising the possibility that cell fusion may contribute to the development or maintenance of these key cell types."

https://openalex.org/W2008967025,"Adiponectin is an adipocyte-specific adipocytokine with anti-atherogenic and anti-diabetic properties. Here, we investigated whether adiponectin regulates angiogenic processes <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Adiponectin stimulated the differentiation of human umbilical vein endothelium cells (HUVECs) into capillary-like structures <i>in vitro</i> and functioned as a chemoattractant in migration assays. Adiponectin promoted the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), protein kinase Akt/protein kinase B, and endothelial nitric oxide synthesis (eNOS) in HUVECs. Transduction with either dominant-negative AMPK or dominant-negative Akt abolished adiponectin-induced eNOS phosphorylation as well as adiponectin-stimulated HUVEC migration and differentiation. Dominant-negative AMPK also inhibited adiponectin-induced Akt phosphorylation, suggesting that AMPK is upstream of Akt. Dominant-negative Akt or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 blocked adiponectin-stimulated Akt and eNOS phosphorylation, migration, and differentiation without altering AMPK phosphorylation. Finally, adiponectin stimulated blood vessel growth <i>in vivo</i> in mouse Matrigel plug implantation and rabbit corneal models of angiogenesis. These data indicate that adiponectin can function to stimulate the new blood vessel growth by promoting cross-talk between AMP-activated protein kinase and Akt signaling within endothelial cells."

https://openalex.org/W1990232129,"Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) can inhibit apoptosis by neutralizing and interacting with apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), a mitochondrial flavoprotein that translocates upon apoptosis induction to the nucleus, via the cytosol. Here, we show that only members of the HSP70 family interact with AIF. Systematic deletion mapping revealed the existence of three distinct functional regions in the AIF protein: (1) a region between amino acids 150 and 228 that binds HSP70, (2) a domain between residues 367 and 459 that includes a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and (3) a C-terminal domain beyond residue 567 required for its chromatin-condensing activity. Deletion of the 150-268 domain completely abolished HSP70 binding and facilitated the nuclear import of AIF, resulting in a gain-of-function phenotype with enhanced AIF-mediated chromatin condensation as compared to wild-type AIF. This gain-of-function phenotype was observed in wild-type control cells (which express low but significant levels of HSP70), yet was lost when AIFDelta150-268 was introduced into HSP70 knockout cells, underscoring the functional importance of the AIF-HSP70 interaction. Altogether, our data demonstrate that AIF inhibition by HSP70 involves cytosolic retention of AIF. Moreover, it appears that endogenous HSP70 protein levels are sufficiently elevated to modulate the lethal action of AIF."

https://openalex.org/W4240447397,"We analysed the expression profiles of 70 kidney tumors of different histological subtypes to determine if these subgroups can be distinguished by their gene expression profiles, and to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying each subtype. In all, 39 clear cell renal cell carcinomas (RCC), seven primary and one metastatic papillary RCC, six granular RCC from old classification, five chromophobe RCC, five sarcomatoid RCC, two oncocytomas, three transitional cell carcinomas (TCC) of the renal pelvis and five Wilms' tumors were compared with noncancerous kidney tissues using microarrays containing 19 968 cDNAs. Based on global gene clustering of 3560 selected cDNAs, we found distinct molecular signatures in clear cell, papillary, chromophobe RCC/oncocytoma, TCC and Wilms' subtypes. The close clustering in each of these subtypes points to different tumorigenic pathways as reflected by their histological characteristics. In the clear cell RCC clustering, two subgroups emerged that correlated with clinical outcomes, confirming the potential use of gene expression signatures as a predictor of survival. In the so-called granular cell RCC (terminology for a subtype that is no longer preferred), none of the six cases clusters together, supporting the current view that they do not represent a single entity. Blinded histological re-evaluation of four cases of ‘granular RCC’ led to their reassignment to other existing histological subtypes, each compatible with our molecular classification. Finally, we found gene sets specific to each subtype. In order to establish the use of some of these genes as novel subtype markers, we selected four genes and performed immunohistochemical analysis on 40 cases of primary kidney tumors. The results were consistent with the gene expression microarray data: glutathione S-transferase α was highly expressed in clear cell RCC, α methylacyl racemase in papillary RCC, carbonic anhydrase II in chromophobe RCC and K19 in TCC. In conclusion, we demonstrated that molecular profiles of kidney cancers closely correlated with their histological subtypes. We have also identified in these subtypes differentially expressed genes that could have important diagnostic and therapeutic implications."
https://openalex.org/W1683181063,"The Oct and Sox transcription factors control many different aspects of neural development and embryogenesis, often binding to adjacent sites on DNA, and interacting with one another through their DNA binding domains to regulate transcription synergistically. Oct proteins contain two DNA binding domains (POUS and POUHD) connected by a flexible linker, which interact with DNA in a bipartite manner. Residual dipolar coupling measurements on the binary Oct1·DNA complex reveal that the two domains are characterized by distinct alignment tensors in both phage pf1 and polyethylene glycol/hexanol liquid crystalline media. We show that this difference is due to a fast microscopic dissociation/association process involving alternative binding modes for the weaker binding POUS domain in the binary complex. Upon binding of Sox2 to an adjacent site in the Hoxb1 regulatory element, all components of the ternary Oct1·Sox2·DNA complex share a single alignment tensor. Thus ternary complex formation increases the site-specific affinity of Oct1 for DNA by effectively locking the POUS domain in a single orientation on the DNA. The solution NMR structure of the ternary 42 kDa Oct1·Sox2·Hoxb1-DNA complex, determined by novel procedures based on orientational restraints from dipolar couplings and conjoined rigid body/torsion angle dynamics, reveals that Sox2 and POUS interact through a predominantly hydrophobic interface, surrounded by a ring of electrostatic interactions. These observations suggest a mechanism of combinatorial control involving direct protein-protein interactions on the DNA whereby Oct1 in conjunction with a co-interacting transcription factor provide cell-specific transcription regulation.

These observations suggest a mechanism of combinatorial control involving direct protein-protein interactions on the DNA whereby Oct1 in conjunction with a co-interacting transcription factor provide cell-specific transcription regulation. Transcription regulation in eukaryotes involves the formation of protein-DNA complexes that can interact with and modulate the downstream transcriptional machinery (1.Levine M. Tjian R. (2003) Nature. 2003; 424: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 2.Ptashne M. Gann A. Genes & Signals. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2002Google Scholar). Unlike prokaryotes that often use a single protein for this function, eukaryotes generally employ complexes of multiple proteins in what has been termed combinatorial control (2.Ptashne M. Gann A. Genes & Signals. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2002Google Scholar, 3.Wolberger C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This mechanism effectively integrates many different signaling pathways to provide a more complex regulatory network based on a finite number of transcription factors. Biological and structural studies of these complexes indicate that combinatorial control is achieved by employing transcription factors with adaptable DNA and protein binding surfaces. This adaptability allows different combinations of these factors to interact on specific promoter elements to drive synergistic transcription regulation (2.Ptashne M. Gann A. Genes & Signals. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2002Google Scholar, 3.Wolberger C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Transcription regulation by the Oct and Sox families of transcription factors reflects many of the principles of combinatorial control. Different members of each family have been shown to interact on different promoter elements to regulate transcription during embryogenesis and neural development (4.Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Kondoh H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 5.Dailey L. Basilico C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 186: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The Sox family is characterized by an HMG-box DNA binding domain that binds in the minor groove, bends DNA (50-90°) and specifically recognizes variations of the consensus sequence CTTTGTT (4.Kamachi Y. Uchikawa M. Kondoh H. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 182-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 5.Dailey L. Basilico C. J. Cell.

Biol. 2001; 312: 481-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The DNA binding region of Oct proteins, known generically as POU, comprises two small, tethered domains, a specific domain (POUS) and a homeodomain (POUHD), that bind in the major groove, do not alter the DNA appreciably from straight B-form, and typically recognize the octamer consensus sequence ATGCTAAT (5.Dailey L. Basilico C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 186: 315-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 7.Klemm J.D. Rould M.A. Aurora R. Herr W. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1994; 77: 21-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that specific promoters are selectively responsive to different members of the Oct transcription factor family. For example, both Oc3/4 and Oct1 can bind adjacent to Sox2 on the FGF4 and UTF1 promoter elements, but only Oct3/4 (or chimeras containing the POU domain from Oct3/4) can synergistically drive transcription from each. Biological data indicate that this synergism derives from direct interaction between the DNA binding domains of each protein (8.Nishimoto M. Fukushima A. Okuda A. Muramatsu M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5453-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 9.Ambrosetti D. Schöler H.R. Dailey L. Basilico C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23387-23397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the FGF4 element contains three additional base pairs between the Oct and Sox binding sites when compared with the UTF1 element. The increased separation between the two proteins must lead to alternative interprotein binding surfaces. More recently, Di Rocco et al. (10.Di Rocco G. Gavala A. Popperl H. Krumlauf R. Mavilio F. Zappavigna V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20506-20515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) showed that the Hoxb1 autoregulatory element contains contiguous Oct and Sox binding sites, with the same relative spacing as in the UTF1 element. However, Oct1 instead of Oct3/4 synergistically drives transcription from the Hoxb1 element. This latter regulatory element functions to selectively promote transcription of Hoxb1 in rhombomere 4 of the hind-brain during embryogenesis (10.Di Rocco G. Gavala A. Popperl H. Krumlauf R.

Development. 2000; 127: 5343-5354PubMed Google Scholar). To further our understanding of combinatorial control at the molecular level, we have solved the three-dimensional solution NMR structure of the biologically relevant ternary 42,000 Mr complex formed by the Oct1 (POUS + POUHD) and Sox2 DNA binding domains bound to a 19-base pair fragment of the Hoxb1 element. Sample Preparation—The POU region (POUS + POUHD) of human Oct1 (residues 275-439) and the HMG-box domain of human Sox2 (residues 40-123) were cloned as histidine tag fusions, expressed, purified by affinity chromatography, and the tags removed proteolytically using standard procedures. Each domain was numbered according to previously determined structures (6.Murphy E.C. Zhurkin V.B. Louis J.M. Cornilescu G. Clore G.M. J. Mol.

NMR samples (in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.02% NaN3, pH 6.5) comprised stoichiometric binary and ternary complexes with the DNA unlabeled and the proteins in various isotopic-labeling combinations (unlabeled, 15N, 15N/13C, 15N/13C/2H, or 15N/13C/2H/VLI-methyl protonated, Ref. 12.Goto N.K.

The concentrations of the binary and ternary complexes in the various samples ranged from 0.5 to 1 mm. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were carried out at 30 °C on Bruker 500, 600, 750, and 800 MHz spectrometers. Spectra were processed using the NMRPipe package (13.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 27-293Crossref Scopus (11638) Google Scholar), and analyzed using the programs PIPP, CAPP, and STAPP (14.Garrett D.S. Powers R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Magn.

Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 22-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). 1H resonance assignments for the DNA were obtained from two-dimensional 12C-filtered NOE and Hartmann-Hahn experiments, aided by prior assignments on the SRY·DNA binary complex (6.Murphy E.C. Zhurkin V.B. Louis J.M. Cornilescu G. Clore G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 481-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Intermolecular distance restraints were derived from three-dimensional 13C-separated/12C-filtered NOE experiments (17.Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 22-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Heteronuclear 3J couplings were measured by quantitative J-correlation spectroscopy (18.Bax A. Vuister G.W. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Wang A.C. Tschudin R. Zhu G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 79-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Residual dipolar couplings (1DNH, 1DNC‘, 1DCαC‘) were measured in 10 mg/ml phage pf1 (19.Clore G.M. Starich M.R. Gronenborn A.M. J. Am. Chem.

NMR. 1999; 14: 333-343Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Structure Calculations—Structures were calculated from the experimental restraints by conjoined rigid body/torsion angle dynamics (22.Schwieters C.D. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2001; 152: 288-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) using the Xplor-NIH macromolecular NMR structure determination package (23.Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2003; 160: 66-74Crossref Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Structure figures were generated with the programs VMD-XPLOR (24.Schwieters C.D. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2001; 149: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and RIBBONS (25.Carson M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 958-961Crossref Scopus (784) Google Scholar). The starting coordinates for the 19-mer DNA were built as follows: the POUS and POUHD hemi-binding sites (base pairs 11-14 and 17-19, respectively) were derived from the 1.9 Å resolution crystal structure of the Oct1·MORE-DNA complex (26.Reményi A. Linz K. Nissen L.J. Reinbold R. Scholer H.R. Wilmanns M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 569-580Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), the Sox2 binding site (base pairs 1-10) from the NMR structure of the related SRY-DNA complex (6.Murphy E.C. Zhurkin V.B. Louis J.M. Cornilescu G. Clore G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 481-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), and the intervening sequences (base pairs 15-16) and regions containing substitutions (base pairs 1, 4, and 10) from classical B-DNA. The resulting model was then subjected to regularization. The following strategy was used in the conjoined rigid body/torsion angle dynamics calculations (see “Results” for general justification of the approach employed). There were four rigid bodies: rigid body 1, backbone and non-interfacial side chains of POUHD and base pairs 17-19 of the DNA (taken from the 1.9 Å resolution Oct1·MORE DNA complex (26.Reményi A.

Rigid bodies 1-3 have both rotational and translational degrees of freedom, while rigid body 4 is given only rotational degrees of freedom. The following interfacial side chains were given torsional degrees of freedom. For POUHD: 10 residues at the POUHD/DNA interface (residues 107, 108, 113, 144, 147, 148, 151, 154, 155, and 158) with 24 side chain torsion angles restrained to within a range of ±20° of values in crystal structures of Oct1·DNA binary complexes. For POUS: 6 residues at the POUS/Sox2 interface (residues 14, 17, 18, 21, 26, and 52); and 14 residues at the POUS/DNA interface (residues 20, 27, 41, 42, 44-46, 48, 49, 54, 58, 59, 62, and 63) with 35 side chain torsion angles restrained to within a range of ±20° of values in crystal structures of Oct1·DNA binary complexes. For Sox2: 7 residues at the POUS/Sox2 interface (residues 59, 62, 63, 66, 67, 71, 73) and 18 residues at the Sox2/DNA interface (residues 4, 6-10, 12, 13, 17, 31, 35, 43, 44, 51, 55, 76, 78, and 79) with 47 side chain torsion angles of conserved residues restrained to within a range of ±20° of values in solution structure of homologous SRY·DNA binary complex. Base pairs 5-16 of the DNA were given torsional degrees of freedom with 220 loose backbone phosphodiester torsion angle restraints to prevent local mirror images (6.Murphy E.C. Zhurkin V.B.

In addition, data base base-base positional (27.Kuszewski J. Schwieters C.D. Clore G.M. J. Am. Chem.

Soc. 2003; 125: 1518-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) potentials of mean force were employed to ensure that good stereochemistry and base-base interactions were preserved throughout the DNA. The following distance restraints were used to preserve protein-DNA interactions observed in the binary Oct1·DNA complex (7.Klemm J.D. Rould M.A. Aurora R. Herr W. Pabo C.O.

At the POUS/DNA interface: 5 distances (3.0 ± 0.5 Å) involving hydrogen bonding interactions to bases from 3 residues; and 10 distances involving electrostatic interactions with phosphates (≤6.1 Å) from 10 residues. At the POUHD/DNA interface: 3 distances (3.0 ± 0.5 Å) involving hydrogen-bonding interactions to bases from 2 residues; and 2 distances involving electrostatic interactions with phosphates (≤6.1 Å) from 2 residues. The final force constants for the various terms in the target function are as follows: 30 kcal·mol-1·Å-2 and 200 kcal·mol-1·rad-2 for the square-well potentials describing the interproton distance and torsion angle restraints, respectively; 1.0 kcal·mol-1·Hz-2 for the harmonic potential describing the 1DNH dipolar coupling restraints; 0.05 and 0.035 kcal·mol-1·Hz-2 for the harmonic potentials describing the 1DNC‘ and 1DCαC‘ dipolar coupling restraints normalized relative to the 1DNH dipolar couplings; 10 kcal·mol-1·Å-2 for the harmonic Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding distance potentials (six per base pair; Ref. 29.Huang K.

Comparison of Domain Structures in Binary and Ternary Complexes—We approached the study of the Oct1·Sox2·Hoxb1-DNA complex by using a variety of isotope (15N, 13C, 2H) labeling schemes to permit the observation of each component of the complex individually as well as to selectively detect intermolecular interactions between the components (17.Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 22-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The largest backbone 1HN/15N chemical shifts differences (ΔH/N ≥ 150 Hz, at 600 MHz) between the ternary (Oct1·Sox2·DNA) and binary (Oct1·DNA and Sox1·DNA) complexes involve contiguous regions of POUS and Sox2 adjacent to the binding site of the other transcription factor (Fig. 1A), consistent with the sequential arrangement of the DNA binding sites (Fig. 2B) and indicative of direct protein-protein interactions between Sox2 and POUS. Titration experiments show that formation of the ternary complex from binary complexes is in slow exchange on the chemical shift scale.Fig. 2Quality of the three-dimensional structure of the ternary Oct1·Sox2·Hoxb1-DNA complex solved by NMR.

POUS (red box), POUHD (yellow oval), and Sox2 (green polygon) are shown next to their respective binding sites (colored bars, as described in Fig. 1). The solid black lines outline regions that were treated as rigid bodies (excluding interfacial side chains). The dashed oval indicates that the translational placement of POUS and POUHD was restrained by a weak non-crystallographic symmetry restraint with respect to the POU·PORE-DNA complex (26.Reményi A.

It should be also emphasized that the dipolar coupling data measured on Sox2 in the ternary complex provide excellent independent cross-validation for the accuracy of the solution NMR coordinates of SRY in the binary complex. Not only were the two data sets collected on homologous proteins bound to different DNA fragments, but they were also collected in different alignment media: the SRY·DNA complex was refined against dipolar couplings measured in a lipid bicelle liquid crystalline medium (6.Murphy E.C. Zhurkin V.B. Louis J.M. Cornilescu G. Clore G.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 481-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) in which the alignment tensor is determined by shape as opposed to both shape and charge distribution in the case of phage pf1 used in the present study (36.Zweckstetter M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3791-3792Crossref Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The structural similarity between Sox2 and SRY is not surprising given that the amino acid differences are localized exclusively to the protein surface. Further, both SRY and Sox2 bend DNA to the same extent, as judged by gel shift circular permutation assays (37.Scaffidi P. Bianchi M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47296-47302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) reflecting the fact that only 4 out of 27 DNA-contacting residues differ between the HMG-boxes of the two proteins (three conservative substitutions of residues that interact with backbone phosphates and an isoleucine to methionine substitution of the residue that intercalates between two AT base pairs). Affinity Modulation and Cooperativity—Comparison of the dipolar coupling data between the POUs and POUHD domains measured on the Oct1·DNA binary complex revealed an unexpected finding. Residual dipolar couplings arise from partial alignment of proteins in a magnetic field, as a consequence, for example, of being dissolved in a dilute liquid crystalline medium (30.Bax A. Kontaxis G. Tjandra N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 127-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). For a macromolecular complex in which the relative orientations of the different components are fixed, all components of the complex will share a single alignment tensor (30.Bax A. Kontaxis G. Tjandra N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 127-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 38.Braddock D.T. Cai M. Baber J.L. Huang Y. Clore G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 8634-8635Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The dipolar coupling data measured in the negatively charged phage medium (Fig. 1B, top panel), however, clearly indicate that the POUS and POUHD domains in the binary complex are characterized by two distinct alignment tensors with very different rhombicities (η): highly rhombic for POUS (η = 0.46 ± 0.05) but close to axially symmetric for POUHD (η = 0.14 ± 0.05). Exactly the same phenomenon is observed in a liquid crystalline medium of neutral polyethylene glycol (PEG)/hexanol (39.Ruckert M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 7793-7797Crossref Scopus (541) Google Scholar), which yields rhombicities of 0.42 ± 0.05 and 0.19 ± 0.05 for the POUS and POUHD domains, respectively (data not shown). Moreover, the 1DNH dipolar couplings measured in the two media are highly correlated with a correlation coeffi"

We report that hypericin-mediated PDT of human cancer cells leads to up-regulation of the inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme and the subsequent release of PGE2. Dissection of the signaling pathways involved revealed that the selective activation of p38 MAPK α and β mediate COX-2 up-regulation at the protein and messenger levels. The p38 MAPK inhibitor, PD169316, abrogated COX-2 expression in PDT-treated cells, whereas overexpression of the drug-resistant PD169316-insensitive p38 MAPK α and β isoforms restored COX-2 levels in the presence of the kinase inhibitor. Transcriptional regulation by nuclear factor-κB was not involved in COX-2 up-regulation by PDT. The half-life of the COX-2 messenger was drastically shortened by p38 MAPK inhibition in transcriptionally arrested cells, suggesting that p38 MAPK mainly acts by stabilizing the COX-2 transcript. Overexpression of WT-p38 MAPK increased cellular resistance to PDT-induced apoptosis, and inhibiting this pathway exacerbated cell death and prevented PGE2 secretion. Hence, the combination of PDT with pyridinyl imidazole inhibitors of p38 MAPK may improve the therapeutic efficacy of PDT by blocking COX-2 up-regulation, which contributes to tumor growth by the release of growth- and pro-angiogenic factors, as well as by sensitizing cancer cells to apoptosis.

PDT involves the administration and subsequent light activation (600–850 nm) of a photosensitizing compound (photosensitizer), which specifically accumulates in tumors (1Dougherty T.J. Gomer C.J.

Hypericin is a naturally occurring photosensitizer synthesized by Hypericum plants (St. John's wort). The interesting photosensitizing properties of hypericin together with its selective uptake in tumor tissues and its minimal dark cytotoxicity, have encouraged the evaluation of this hydroxylated phenanthroperylenequinone in the photodynamic treatment of cancers (3Agostinis P. Vantieghem A. Merlevede W. de Witte P.A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 34: 221-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Although hypericin does not preferentially accumulate in mitochondria but localizes mainly to the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, a rapid release of cytochrome c into the cytosol and the subsequent activation of the apoptosome, are the signaling events precipitating apoptotic cell death by the photodynamic stress (4Vantieghem A.

Xu Y. Agostinis P. de Witte P.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2002; 98: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), modulation of apoptotic vulnerability is critical for the therapeutic efficacy of this drug. Cellular commitment to apoptosis, or the ability to evade apoptosis in response to cell damage, involves the integration of a complex network of both survival and death pathways. The MAPK family a central mediator of survival and cell death pathways, and MAPKs have been implicated in the response of tumor cells to very diverse antitumor signals, including PDT (2Oleinick N.L. Morris R.L. Belichenko I. Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2002; 1: 1-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). The three major MAPK pathways in mammalian cells include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinases (JNKs), and the p38 MAPKs (9Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ERKs are acutely stimulated by growth and differentiation factors through activated receptor tyrosine kinases, heterotrimeric G protein-coupled receptors, or cytokine receptors (9Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The JNKs and p38 MAPKs are activated in response to a variety of stress signals including UV irradiation, chemotherapeutics, osmotic stress, hypoxia/anoxia, hyperthermia, and they have been involved in the regulation of apoptosis (9Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study we have shown that, parallel to the caspase-activation cascade, hypericin-mediated PDT leads to inhibition of ERK2 (6Assefa Z. Vantieghem A. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8788-8796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), and to a sustained activation of the stress-activated protein kinases, JNK1 and p38 MAPK. Activation of JNK1 and p38 MAPK was suggested to have a protective role against PDT-induced apoptosis (6Assefa Z. Vantieghem A. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Vandenheede J.R. Merlevede W. de Witte P.

However, downstream targets of these signaling cascades still need to be identified. Some recent reports have implicated p38 MAPK in the up-regulation of the inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (cox-2) gene (10Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell.

COX catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) H2, the immediate substrate for a number of cell specific prostaglandin and tromboxane synthases, leading to the production and release of PGE2 and other prostanoids, that contribute to the development of important immunomodulatory responses (15Smith W.L. De Witt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2464) Google Scholar, 16Williams C.S. Mann M. DuBois R.N.

Two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2, have been identified and their expression is differently regulated. COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most cell types and may be responsible for housekeeping functions. By contrast, the expression of COX-2, which is regulated both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level, is barely detectable in normal tissues but is rapidly induced in response to tumor promoters, oncogenes, cytokines, and mitogens (15Smith W.L. De Witt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2464) Google Scholar, 16Williams C.S. Mann M. DuBois R.N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7908-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 17Cao Y. Prescott S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In a number of cellular and animal models, COX-2 has been shown to promote cell growth, to inhibit apoptosis, and to enhance cell motility and adhesion, and COX-2 overexpression is sufficient to cause tumorigenesis (reviewed in Refs. 16Williams C.S. Mann M. DuBois R.N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7908-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar and 17Cao Y. Prescott S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In agreement with these observations, COX-2 is up-regulated in many tumors, and this up-regulation has been shown to promote cancer progression, recurrence, and invasiveness, as well as angiogenesis (16Williams C.S. Mann M. DuBois R.N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7908-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar, 17Cao Y. Prescott S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the use of specific COX-2 inhibitors may be beneficial in the management of these neoplasms. Interestingly, the combination of porphyrin- and chlorin-based PDT with a specific COX-2 inhibitor, was recently reported to increase the tumoricidal potential of PDT in vivo (18Ferrario A. Von Tiehl K. Wong S. Luna M. Gomer C.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3956-3961PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying PDT-mediated COX-2 up-regulation and its protective effect were not further explored. In the present study, we show that hypericin-mediated PDT leads to COX-2 up-regulation and secretion of PGE2, which are completely dependent on the specific activation of p38 MAPK. We also provide evidence in support for a post-transcriptional role of p38 MAPK in stabilizing COX-2 mRNA and for a functional involvement of p38 MAPK in counteracting PDT-induced apoptosis. Our results suggest that inhibition of the p38 MAPK signaling cascade, which results in the repression of COX-2 up-regulation and concomitant increase in the susceptibility of the cells to undergo apoptosis, could be of clinical relevance to improve the efficacy of hypericin-mediated PDT of cancers.

Transient Transfections—The drug-resistant (DR) p38 α was produced by mutating Thr106, His107, and Leu108 to Met, Pro, and Phe, respectively. In the case of the DR p38β, Thr106, Thr107, and Leu108 were changed to Met, Met, and Phe, respectively. Mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). DR p38α and p38β mutants were generated using complementary primers (only the forward primer is shown) 5′-gacgtgtacctggtgatgcctttcatgggggcggacctgaacaacatcg-3′ and 5′-gaagtgtacttggtgatgatgtttatgggcgccgacctgaacaacatcg-3′, respectively. FLAG-tagged p38α and FLAG-tagged p38β were kindly provided by Dr. J. Han (Scripps Institute, CA). For transient transfection cells were seeded at 1.0 × 106 (T24) or 7.0 × 105 (HeLa) cells/10 cm Petri dish. After an overnight culture, pcDNA3, WT p38, MKK3, DR-p38, and pEGFP-C3 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) (4:1) expression vectors were co-transfected using either the Lipofectin® Plus” (Invitrogen, Merelbeke, Belgium) transfection reagent (T24 cells) or the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science, Vilvoorde, Belgium) (HeLa cells) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 7 h of transfection the medium was changed with complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Twenty-four hours after transient transfection, cells were incubated with or without hypericin for 16 h at 37 °C in dark. Cells were then irradiated as described above. Transfection efficiency was determined by calculating the percentage of fluorescent green cells over the total number of cells under a fluorescence microscope. Total lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting. Cell Cycle Analysis—The cell cycle profile was analyzed by flow cytometry after staining of the DNA with Sytox Green according to Vantieghem et al. (7Vantieghem A. Xu Y. Assefa Z. Piette J.

Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were obtained, and EMSA was performed as described by Volanti et al. (20Volanti C. Matroule J.Y. Piette J. Photochem. Photobiol. 2002; 75: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). DNA-protein complexes were resolved by nondenaturing PAGE. Gels were vacuum dried and exposed to Fuji x-ray films. The sequence of the probe (Eurogentec, Liège, Belgium) used was: NF-κB probe, 5′-GGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTG-3′. PGE2Measurement—Cells were photosensitized as described before. After the indicated time points, the medium was collected, dead cells were removed by centrifugation, and PGE2 concentrations were measured by the PGE2 ELISA Kit (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK) according to manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR—After indicated time points, total RNA was isolated with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, West Sussex, UK) and spectrophotometrically quantified, and the RT-PCR reaction was performed with the ThermoScript™ RT-PCR System (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. The reactions were heated at 94 °C for 3 min and then immediately cycled 26 times through a 30 s denaturating step at 94 °C, a 30 s annealing step at 55 °C and a 30 s extension step at 72 °C. After the cycling procedure, a final 10 min elongation step at 72 °C was performed. The following primers were used: COX-2, (F) 5′-TTCAAATGAGATTGTGGGAAAAT-3′ and (R) 5′-AGATCATCTCTGCCTGAGTATCTT-3′; GAPDH, (F) 5′-CCATCAACGACCCCTTCATTGACC-3′ and (R) 5′-GAAGGCCATGCCAGTGAGCTTCC-3′. RNA Stability Assay—The cells were treated as described before. 5-h post-irradiation, the medium was changed to fresh medium containing actinomycin D (3 μg/ml) with or without the p38 MAPK inhibitor PD169316. At different time intervals, cells were collected for RNA preparation. RNA was examined by RT-PCR analysis. PDT with Hypericin Induces Apoptosis in Cancer Cells via the Intrinsic Pathway of Caspase Activation—Dose- and time-dependent studies of the cell death response in the human TCC cell line T24, showed an accumulation of apoptotic cells starting at 3 h post-irradiation, using 150 nm as the optimal lethal hypericin concentration in combination with 4 J/cm2 light dose (Fig. 1, A and C). T24 cells treated with 150 nm hypericin and irradiated, showed a time-dependent increase in the amount of cells with apoptotic morphology, which was paralleled by the increase in cytosolic cytochrome c and cleavage of procaspase-3 and its downstream substrate PARP (Fig. 1B). Apoptotic cell death could be blocked by the cell-permeable caspase inhibitors z-VAD-fmk and z-DEVD-fmk (data not shown), confirming that PDT-induced apoptosis in T24 cells is a caspase-dependent process. As shown in Fig. 1C, activation of procaspase-3 was clearly detectable 7 h after irradiation whereas a negligible increase in caspase-8 activity could be measured 24 h after PDT, likely as a result of a caspase-3 feedback activation loop (21Slee E.A. Adrain C. Martin S.J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Similar kinetics of cytochrome c release and dependence on procaspase-3 activation for the progression of apoptosis, have been shown in HeLa cells (4Vantieghem A. Assefa Z. Vandenabeele P.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8788-8796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), indicating that the main mechanism triggering apoptotic cell death in response of hypericin-mediated PDT is conserved in a variety of human cancer cells. Hypericin-mediated PDT of Cancer Cells Leads to Up-regulation of COX-2—Cyclooxygenase-2 is an inducible enzyme whose up-regulation has been linked to tumor recurrence and progression in different cancers, including TCC of the human urinary bladder (22Shirahama T. Arima J. Akiba S. Sakakura C. Cancer. 2001; 92: 188-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Since in an experimental animal system hypericin-based PDT of bladder TCC has been shown to be only partially effective because of recurrence (23Kamuhabwa A.R. Roskams T. D'Hallewin M.A. Baert L. Van Poppel H. de Witte P.A. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 107: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we set out to investigate whether photosensitization of T24 and HeLa cells with hypericin could cause COX-2 up-regulation. Fig. 2A shows that while the basal level of COX-2 in the untreated T24 and HeLa cells was hardly detectable, PDT promoted a time-dependent and sustained increase in COX-2 protein levels. In both cancer cell lines the induction of COX-2 protein was detectable within 3 h after irradiation, attained a steady state at 7–16-h post-irradiation, reaching more than a 12-fold induction, and declined very gradually thereafter (Fig. 2A). Dose response experiments (data not shown) revealed COX-2 induction by hypericin concentrations starting from sublethal doses of 25 nm, corresponding to 80% cell survival (Fig. 1C), and increasing up to 150–200 nm, which corresponds to ∼20% cell survival. In all cases this response was totally light-dependent. Since COX-2 is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of PGE2, we also evaluated the release of this prostaglandin into the medium at the post-irradiation time corresponding to maximal COX-2 induction. As compared with control cells, the levels of secreted PGE2 increased severalfold following exposure of the cells to PDT (Fig. 2B). In the presence of the methyl sulfoxide NS-398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor (24Liu X.H. Yao S. Kirschenbaum A. Levine A.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4245-4249PubMed Google Scholar), the release of PGE2 was totally blocked (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that the induction of PGE2 synthesis coincides with up-regulation of COX-2 protein levels in response to the photodynamic stress. Cyclooxygenase-2 Is Selectively Up-regulated by the PDT-induced p38 MAPK Signaling Pathway—It has been reported that in T24 cells, which bear an oncogenic H-ras mutation, the MEKK1-p38 MAPK and the Raf-ERK cascades are constitutively activated (25Gupta A.K. Bakanauskas V.J. Cerniglia G.J. Cheng Y. Bernhard E.J. Musche l R.J. McKenna W.G. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4278-4282PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with this, we found that in untreated T24 cells the activity state of p38 MAPK and ERKs (Fig. 3) was elevated. However, whereas the activity level of ERKs was rapidly reduced by PDT, the basal phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK dropped drastically to an undetectable level, to be followed by a de novo p38 MAPK activation, which was specifically mediated by PDT stress (Fig. 3). Interestingly, PDT of HeLa cells, with either membrane- or mitochondria-targeted photosensitizers, has been shown to cause an immediate dose-dependent attenuation of the EGF- or inflammatory cytokine-mediated signal through rapid degradation of the EGF receptor or down-modulation of cytokine-responsive signaling pathways (26Wong T.W. Tracy E. Oseroff A.R. Baumann H. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3812-3818PubMed Google Scholar). These PDT-mediated early effects could indeed explain why in HeLa (6Assefa Z. Vantieghem A. Declercq W.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8788-8796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and T24 cells (Fig. 3) we observed a down-regulation of the basal activity levels of ERK and p38 MAPK immediately after irradiation. No difference in the protein levels was observed as shown for p38 MAPK (Fig. 3), indicating that PDT effects are due to changes in the phosphorylation/activity state of these signaling enzymes exclusively (data not shown).

Here we show that EO6 reacts with free apolipoprotein(a) apo(a), its C-terminal domain, F2 (but not the N-terminal F1), kringle V-containing fragments obtained by the enzymatic digestion of apo(a) and also kringle V-containing apo(a) recombinants. The evidence that kringle V is critical for EO6 reactivity is supported by the finding that apo(a) of rhesus monkeys lacking kringle V did not react with EO6. Based on the previously established EO6 specificity requirements, we hypothesized that all or some of the six lysines in human kringle V are involved in Schiff base linkage with oxPtdPC. To test this hypothesis, we made use of a recombinant lysine-containing apo(a) fragment, rIII, containing kringle V but not the protease domain. EO6 reacted with rIII before and after reduction to stabilize the Schiff base and also after extensive ethanol/ether extraction that yielded no lipids. On the other hand, delipidation of the saponified product yielded an average of two mol of phospholipids/mol of protein consistent with direct analysis of inorganic phosphorous on the non-saponified rIII. Moreover, only two of the six theoretical free lysine amino groups per mol of rIII were unavailable to chemical modification by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. Finally, rIII, like human apo(a), stimulated the production of interleukin 8 in THP-1 macrophages in culture. Together, our studies provide evidence that in human apo(a), kringle V is the site that reacts with EO6 via lysine-oxPtdPC adducts that may also be involved in the previously reported pro-inflammatory effect of apo(a) in cultured human macrophages.

The other kringles, classified from 1 to 10, occur as a single copy each differing in amino acid sequence (1Scanu A.M. Curr. Atheroscler. Reports. 2003; 5: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The function of some of these kringles has been recognized. For instance, the microdomain comprising KIV-5 through KV-8 has been reported to be involved in the first step of non-covalent interaction between apo(a) and apoB100, and KIV-9 via its unpaired cysteine is responsible for the formation of the disulfide bond that stabilizes the interaction between apo(a) and apoB100 (1Scanu A.M. Curr. Atheroscler. Reports. 2003; 5: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 2Hobbs H.H. White A.L. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1999; 10: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Moreover, KIV-10 contains the high affinity lysine binding site that plays a dominant role in the binding of apo(a) to fibrin(ogen) and components of the vascular extracellular matrix (3Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. Atheroscl. Thromb. Vascl. BIol. 1996; Google Scholar). For KV, the reported roles have been an attenuating effect on LDL oxidation (4Hill B.C. Becker L. Anand V. Kusmierczyk A.

Of interest, human KV has six lysine residues in contrast with the other kringles that contain no lysine except for KIV-4 and KIV-9 each having one lysine (6Scanu A.M. Edelstein C. Biochim. Biophys.

In apo(a), kringles are joined by linkers that vary in size and amino acid sequence and contain O-glycans that account for most of the carbohydrate content of apo(a), about 33% by weight. An exception is the linker between KIV-4 and KIV-5 that contains no carbohydrates and shown to be the preferential site of cleavage by metalloproteinases and leukocyte and pancreatic elastases (7Scanu A.M. Edelstein C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2193-2206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under conditions of limited proteolysis these enzymes cleave apo(a) into two domains, F1 and F2, representing the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively, the latter spanning the region between KIV-5 and the protease domain (PD). F1 and F2 differ markedly in structural properties and function (7Scanu A.M. Edelstein C. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2193-2206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There has been much recent emphasis on the pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic influences of oxidized lipoproteins with particular focus on oxidized LDL (oxLDL) (8Glass C.K. Witztum J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 503-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2636) Google Scholar). During the oxidation of LDL, many neo-antigenic determinants are generated, which can elicit autoantibody responses. One of these antibodies, which has received a great deal of attention is the monoclonal antibody EO6, an IgM natural antibody cloned from the spleen of apoE-deficient mice (9Palinski W. Hörkkö S. Miller E. Steinbrecher U.P. Powell H.C. Curtiss L.K. Witztum J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 800-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) along with several other such antibodies, recognizes predominantly the phosphorylcholine (PC) moiety of oxidized phosphatidylcholine (oxPtdPC) but not the PC of unoxidized PtdPC. EO6 recognizes oxidized PtdPC present in the lipid moiety of oxLDL, as well as when the oxidized phospholipids (PL) is covalently attached to apoB of oxLDL. In the latter situation, the oxidized PtdPC is linked to the ϵ amino group of lysine of apoB via a Schiff base with the aldehyde derived from the sn-2 fatty acid of oxPtdPC (10Hörkkö B., D.A.

EO6 binds not only to oxLDL but oxidized epitopes in sites of inflammation most notably the atherosclerotic plaque (13Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2001; 11: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). In human plasma, EO6 has been shown to specifically react with epitopes on Lp(a) (14Tsimikas S. Bergmark C. Beyer R.W. Patel R. Pattison J. Miller E. Juliano J. Witztum J.L. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2003; 41: 360-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to investigate the location and nature of the reactive site(s) in Lp(a) and the potential involvement of lysines in apo(a). For this purpose we used pure preparations of human Lp(a), apo(a), derivatives thereof, rhesus monkey apo(a), and selected apo(a) recombinants and assessed EO6 reactivity by ELISA and immunoblot analyses. The results of these studies are the subject of this report. Materials—Human leukocyte elastase (LE) (EC 3.4.21.37), porcine pancreatic elastase (EC 1.4.21.36) Type V, ϵ-aminocaproic acid (EACA), (4-amidinophenyl)-methanesulfonyl fluoride (APMSF), diisopropyl fluorophosphates (DFP), 2,4,6-trinitobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS), and PtdPC-specific phospholipase C (3.1.4.3) from Bacillus cereus (2000 units/mg; P9439) (<20 units/mg sphingomyelinase activity) were from Sigma Chemical Co. Immobilon-P membranes were from Millipore (Bedford, MA) and an enhanced chemiluminescent kit (ECL Western blotting detection kit) from Amersham Biosciences. All tissue culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen and were of low endotoxin grade. Antisera to purified preparations of apo(a), Lp(a), and LDL were raised in the rabbit and affinity-purified antibodies to apo(a), Lp(a) (anti-Lp(a)), and LDL (anti-apoB) were prepared as previously described (15Fless G.M. Snyder M.L. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 651-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-Lp(a) was shown to be devoid of immunoreactivity to LDL and plasminogen; anti-apoB was unreactive to apo(a). The monoclonal KV antibody was prepared as previously described (16Edelstein C. Italia J.I. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11079-11087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). EO6 was prepared as previously described (9Palinski W. Hörkkö S.

Preparation of Human Lp(a), Apo(a), Lp(a-), and LDL—Lp(a), having a single apo(a) isoform with 14 type IV kringles, KV and the protease domain, was isolated from the plasma of a normal donor by combining ultracentrifugation and lysine-Sepharose column chromatography as described previously (17Fless G.M. Snyder M.L. Furbee J.W.J. Garcia-Hedo M.T. Mora R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13492-13501Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Apo(a) was separated from the purified Lp(a) under mild reductive conditions with 1.25 mm dithiothreitol, (DTE) as previously described (18Edelstein C. Mandala M. Pfaffinger D. Scanu A.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16483-16492Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Lp(a-) was the LDL byproduct after reduction of Lp(a) with DTE and was found to be free of apo(a). Authentic LDL was isolated at d 1.030–1.050 g/ml from the plasma by sequential flotation (19Schumaker V.N. Puppione D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 155-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). The final products were homogeneous by 1% agarose electrophoresis and 4% PAGE-SDS and shown not to be cross-contaminated by immunoblot analyses using polyclonal antisera against apoB100 and apo(a). Preparation of Rhesus Lp(a) and Derived Apo(a)—Lp(a) was isolated from rhesus plasma as described previously (20Scanu A.M. Miles L.A. Fless G.M. Pfaffinger D. Eisenbart J. Jackson E. Hooverplow J.L. Brunck T. Plow E.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Rhesus apo(a) was isolated from Lp(a) as already described for the human counterpart. Oxidation of Human LDL—The procedure was as described previously (11Gillotte K.L. Hörkkö S. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J.

The oxidation was conducted in PBS, pH 7.4 in the presence of 50 μm APMSF and 2 μg/ml of aprotinin at 37 °C with 10 μm CuSO4 for 18 h at 37 °C. The progress of the reaction was monitored at timed intervals by the release of fatty acids using a commercial kit (Wako, Richmond, VA) and diene generation by absorbance at 234 nm. Isolation and Purification of Human Apo(a) Fragments—The schematic representation of the apo(a) fragments obtained by limited proteolysis using either human leukocyte or pancreatic elastase is outlined in Fig. 1. The digestion of Lp(a) and the isolation of the fragments was as described previously (5Klezovitch O. Edelstein C. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46864-46869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The purity of the fragments was assessed by SDS-PAGE on Coomassie-stained gels and by Western blot analysis using polyclonal monospecific rabbit anti-apo(a) and anti-apoB100 antibodies as well as monoclonal anti-KV antibodies. In addition, N-terminal sequence analysis of the first 20 amino acids confirmed the purity and identity of each fragment. When the studies involved only F1 and F2, these fragments were prepared by limited digestion of apo(a) with pancreatic elastase as previously described by Edelstein et al. (21Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified fragments were stored in 10 mm PO4, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm EACA and 125 mm trehalose at –80 °C. Generation of Recombinant Apo(a) Fragments—The 6K recombinant, r6K, was cloned into a pCMV-4 vector driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter as described and provided by Dr. N. O. Davidson (22Bonen D.K. Nassir F. Hausman A.M. Davidson N.O. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 1629-1640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It contains the signal sequence, a 333 bp fusion kringle (93 bp from KIV-1 and 240 bp from KIV-5, followed by 3004 bp of apo(a) sequence containing single copies of KIV-2 through KIV-10, KV and a protease domain, PD. The signal peptide sequence was necessary in order to permit secretion of the recombinant protein into the conditioned medium. The rIII recombinant lacking KIV-6, 7, 8 and PD (6KΔKIV6–8ΔPD) was prepared by digesting the 6K expression plasmid with ClaI and EcoRV. Subsequently, the 2.4-kb ClaI-EcoRV insert was subjected to digestion with BamHI in order to remove the BamHI-BamHI internal DNA domains coding for apo(a) KIV-6 through 8. The 0.32 kb ClaI-BamHI and the 1.03 kb BamHI-EcoRV DNA fragments were then ligated back into the 6K expression plasmid digested with ClaI and EcoRV (vector part). Both the 6K and the rIII (6KΔKIV6–8ΔPD) (Fig. 2) were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells and the clones producing significant amounts of recombinant products (0.5–10 mg/liter of the culture medium) were purified by lysine-Sepharose chromatography. Delipidation of Apo(a)—Lipids were extracted from purified apo(a) at 4 °C for 8 h with 95% ethanol/ethyl ether, 3:2 v/v. The precipitated apo(a) was subjected to a further extraction with ethyl ether for 18 h at 4 °C followed by four washes of ethyl ether. Protein Modification—NaCNBH3 reduction of Lp(a) and apo(a), its derived fragments and the recombinants was carried out by a method previously described with minor modifications (11Gillotte K.L. Hörkkö S. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 824-833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Lp(a), apo(a), and fragments, present in 0.05 m HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, were incubated with 0.15 m NaCNBH3 at a final concentration of 20 mm at room temperature for 2 h. The reaction was stopped by extensive dialysis against 10 mm PO4 buffer, pH 7.0. Under these conditions, Schiff base adducts are selectively reduced to stable amines. Saponification was carried out on delipidated and NaCNBH3 reduced apo(a) and reduced rIII by incubating with 1 m NaOH for 1 h at 37 °C. After incubation, 6 n HCl was added dropwise to obtain a neutral pH. Phospholipase C treatment of the reduced forms of apo(a) and rIII was conducted at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm Ca2+ for 4 h. The reaction was stopped with 1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline and immediately analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Electrophoretic Methods—SDS-PAGE, (4% polyacrylamide or gradients of 4–12%), polyacrylamide) was performed on a Novex system (Novex, San Diego, CA) for 1.5 h at constant voltage (120 V) at 22 °C as previously described (21Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Native gels (4% or gradients of 4–12% polyacrylamide) were run for 4 h at 23 °C in Tris-glycine buffer without SDS. Immediately after electrophoresis, the gels were placed onto Immobilon-P sheets (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), which were previously wetted with a buffer containing 48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, pH 8.9. Blotting was performed on a horizontal semi-dry electroblot apparatus (Amersham Biosciences) at 0.8–1 mA/cm2 for 45 min for SDS-PAGE and 80 min for native gels at 23 °C. Immunoblotting—After electroblotting, the Immobilon-P sheets were blocked in PBS containing 5% nonfat dry powdered milk and 0.3% Tween 20 followed by incubation with anti-apo(a) or anti-apoB100 antibody. Subsequently, the blots were developed with the ECL Western detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Detection of oxidized products with the IgM monoclonal antibody EO6 was performed by first blocking the Immobilon-P sheets with Superblock (Pierce) for 1 h at 23 °C followed by incubation for 18 h at 4 °C with EO6 in 10% Superblock, after washing (3 times at 15 min each), the membranes were visualized as above except that goat anti-mouse IgM (μ-chain-specific) peroxidase conjugated antibodies were used. Other blocking agents such as 5% nonfat dry powdered milk or BSA (3–5%) gave a dark background and could not be interpreted. Lipoprotein and Apolipoprotein Analyses—Lp(a) protein were quantified by a sandwich ELISA essentially as previously described (15Fless G.M. Snyder M.L. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 651-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that anti-Lp(a) IgG was used as the capture antibody and anti-apoB100 IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase as the detection antibody. For the ELISA quantitation of apo(a), anti-apo(a) IgG conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was used as the detection antibody. Chemiluminescent Immunoassay for Antibody Binding—The relative quantitation of oxidized phospholipids bound to vatious proteins was assessed by measuring the EO6 immunoreactivity in lipoproteins and the derived apo(a) and fragments thereof, as previously described (10Hörkkö B., D.A. Miller E. Itabe H. Leitinger N. Subbanagounder G. Berliner J.A. Friedman P. Dennis E.A. Curtiss L.K. Palinski W. Witztum J.L. J. Clin.

All samples were analyzed in triplicate, and the data expressed as relative light unit (RLU) per 100 ms. Amino Group Analysis—The number of free reactive amino groups was determined by reactivity with TNBS as previously described with minor modifications (11Gillotte K.L. Hörkkö S. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 824-833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, samples, first reduced with NaCNBH3 and dialyzed against 0.15 m NaHCO3 pH 8.5 were brought to 750 μl in 0.15 m NaHCO3 and 50 μl of 0.1% TNBS in the same buffer was added, vortexed, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Then 100 μl of 10% SDS and 200 μl of 1 n HCl were added, vortexed, and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Absorbance was determined at 335 nm and the amount of amine was calculated from known amounts of valine used as a standard. Studies on THP-1 Cells in Culture—The conditions were those previously described (5Klezovitch O. Edelstein C. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46864-46869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, the human monocyte leukemia cell line, THP-1, obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin, and gentamicin (50 μg/ml) and 50 μm βME at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Experiments were conducted in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml and incubated in the complete growth medium in the presence of 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 72 h. After washing in serum-free medium and a further incubation for 16 h, the cells were exposed to 200 nm of apo(a) or rIII for 24 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, the amount of IL-8 released in the culture media was assessed by ELISA (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All the measurements were conducted in triplicate. The endotoxin content of both apo(a) and rIII, was determined by using the Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. The amount of endotoxin for both proteins was extremely small (less than 0.25 pg/μg of protein). Other Analyses—Inorganic phosphorous (Pi) was quantified using the microtechnique described by Bartlett (23Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by first digesting the sample with 10 n H2SO4 at 160 °C for 18 h. Phospholipid values were obtained by multiplying the inorganic phosphate results by 25. Protein determinations were performed by the Bio-Rad DC protein assay using BSA as a standard. The EO6 Reactive Site Resides in Apo(a)—In human plasma EO6 reacts with Lp(a) (14Tsimikas S. Bergmark C. Beyer R.W. Patel R. Pattison J. Miller E. Juliano J. Witztum J.L. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2003; 41: 360-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). To define the EO6 reactvity of the protein, we carried out Western blot analyses of 4% SDS-PAGE on Lp(a), Lp(a-), apo(a), and authentic LDL isolated from the same subject. Both Lp(a) and apo(a) were EO6 reactive as well as oxLDL, used as a positive control. In contrast, both authentic LDL and Lp(a-) were unreactive (Fig. 3A). Of note, the immunoblots performed with EO6 detected mainly the associated forms of apo(a), i.e. dimer and trimer (Fig. 3A, lane 1) probably an expression of a high abundance of epitopes in the aggregated species. In contrast, the anti-apo(a) blots exhibited the monomeric form (Fig. 3A, lane 6). Aggregation was likely attributable to the presence of kringle IV-9 containing an unpaired cysteine. Because of differences in sensitivity, the detection in the EO6 system required a 50-fold larger gel loading of apo(a) than in the anti-apo(a) system. The concentration dependence of the aggregation was demonstrated by the fact that a load of 5 μg of apo(a) under the same electrophoretic conditions (presence of SDS, non-reduced) resulted in the appearance of dimer-trimer species upon Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). The EO6 Reactive Site Resides in the C-terminal Domain of Apo(a)—To define the EO6 reactive site, apo(a) was subjected to limited proteolysis by pancreatic elastase. In keeping with previous findings (21Edelstein C. Italia J.A. Klezovitch O. Scanu A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1786-1801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this procedure generated two major fragments, F1, and F2, representing the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively (Fig. 1). By Western blot analyses of 4–12% SDS-PAGE, EO6 detected only F2 (Fig. 3B). As noted for apo(a) in Fig. 3A, the mass of F2 required for EO6 detection was 5 μg, and aggregated forms were also seen. The EO6 Reactive Site Resides in the KV-PD Region of F2—In these studies we subjected apo(a) to a more extensive digestion by leukocyte elastase and the resulting fragments were purified to homogeneity (5Klezovitch O. Edelstein C. Scanu A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46864-46869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Of them, only F7 (KV-PD) reacted with EO6 (Fig. 3C), as compared with the lack of reactivity by F5 and F6 (KIV-5 through KIV-10). The absence of aggregation noted for F7 can be explained by the fact that it lacks kringle IV-9 containing the free cysteine. The results in Fig. 3 were corroborated in a direct ELISA binding assay (Fig. 4). Fragment F7 (KV-PD) was less reactive by ELISA than by Western blot analyses. This could be due to less efficient plating efficiency due to its smaller size. Studies on Rhesus Monkey Apo(a)—Rhesus monkey apo(a) lacks KV while retaining the PD (24Tomlinson J. McLean J. Lawn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5957-5965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By both Western blot analysis (not shown) and ELISA (Fig 4A), rhesus apo(a) did not react with EO6. This observation is consistent with the thesis that KV of apo(a) is responsible for the EO6 reactivity found on apo(a). Studies with Recombinants—In these studies we wanted to establish whether the information on KV obtained with natural products could also apply to apo(a) recombinants. For this purpose, we used two recombinants, r6K and rIII that have been described in Fig. 2. These two recombinants share the signal peptide, the fusion kringles KIV 1/5, KIV-9, KIV-10 and KV but not the PD. Both r6K and rIII reacted with EO6 by Western blot analyses (Fig. 3D) and ELISA (Fig. 4) confirming that KV is the apo(a)-reacting site. KIV 1/5, KIV-9 and KIV-10 are excluded as the reactive site based on the experiments depicted in Fig. 3C showing that only F7 of the fragments F5, F6, and F7 is reactive. It should be noted that on the Western blots both recombinants showed aggregates due to the relatively high loading (5 μg) on the gels. Only monomers were present in the anti-apo(a) blots. Having obtained evidence that KV is the EO6 reactive site in apo(a), we next directed our attention to the lysine residues based on the previous observations that EO6 binds to the PC group of oxidized phospholipids that are covalently bound to lysines of proteins or peptides by a Schiff base between the aldehyde of oxPtdPC and the epsilon amino group of the lysine (11Gillotte K.L. Hörkkö S. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 824-833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Friedman P. Hörkkö S. Steinberg D. Witztum J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7010-7020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In order to stabilize any Schiff bases present we reduced both apo(a) and rIII with NaCNBH3 to form a stable secondary amine (see “Experimental Procedures”) and performed a Western blot analysis. These two stabilized products exhibited the same EO6 reactivity as their untreated counterparts (Fig. 5A). Phospholipids in Apo(a) and rIII—The EO6 reactivity observed on the proteins subjected to Western blot analysis in the presence of SDS implies a covalent association of PC containing oxPL with the reactive fragments of apo(a). In these studies we wanted to determine whether there were PLs in apo(a) and in rIII and, if so, their mode of association. As a first step, we"

We have found that a dominant negative form of IκB kinase 2 and a mutant form of IκB, which acts as a super-repressor of NF-κB, blocked activation of the ISRE by the TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharide but not the TLR3 ligand poly(I-C). TLR4 failed to activate the ISRE in mouse embryonic fibroblasts bearing a targeted deletion of p65, whereas the response to TLR3 in these cells was normal. The p65 subunit of NF-κB was detected in the lipopolysaccharide-activated but not poly(I-C)-activated ISRE-binding complex. Finally, p65 promoted transactivation of gene expression by IRF-3. These results therefore indicate that IRF-3-mediated activation of the ISRE by TLR4 but not TLR3 requires the p65 subunit of NF-κB.

TLRs allow the host to differentiate between groups of pathogens and to tailor its initial response accordingly. At least 10 different TLRs occur in humans (1Dunne, A., and O'Neill, L. A. (2003) Science's STKE, http://stke.sciencemag.org/gci/content/full/sigtrans;2003/171/reGoogle Scholar). Most of their ligands have been assigned, the majority of which are so-called pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Two of the best studied TLRs are TLR4, which recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria, and TLR3, which recognizes the viral double-stranded RNA mimic poly(I-C) (2Hoshino K.

Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4959) Google Scholar). TLRs are defined by external leucine-rich repeats and a cytoplasmic Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain (1Dunne, A., and O'Neill, L. A. (2003) Science's STKE, http://stke.sciencemag.org/gci/content/full/sigtrans;2003/171/reGoogle Scholar). Upon stimulation the TLRs recruit TIR domain-containing adaptor molecules via homotypic interactions with receptor TIR domains. This initiates signal transduction culminating in the activation of transcription factors and an increase in immune and inflammatory gene expression. A key question concerns specificity in signal transduction by different TLRs, because although common gene sets are induced by TLRs, specific patterns of gene expression have been demonstrated for TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4, which may provide a molecular basis for the tailoring of innate immune response (6Huang Q.

Myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) was the first TIR domain-containing adaptor to be described. It is a general adaptor for TLRs, and loss of MyD88 prevents signal transduction through most of the TLRs. The only known exceptions are TLR3 and TLR4, which both initiate a so-called “MyD88-independent” pathway (5Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A.

TLR4 also recruits MyD88 and an additional adaptor named MyD88 adapter-like (Mal) or TIR domain-containing adapter protein, which is also required for TLR2 signaling (18Fitzgerald K.A.

Upon stimulation with poly(I-C), IRF-3 becomes phosphorylated in its C terminus, which presumably reveals the previously hidden dimerization domain (22Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell.

In the case of the C-terminal phosphorylation two IκB kinase (IKK)-related proteins, IKKϵ and TANK-binding kinase 1, have recently been identified as possible components of the virus- and TLR3-activated kinase complex for IRF-3 (25Sharma S. tenOever B.R.

In this study we have found a key role for the NF-κB subunit p65 in the IRF-3-mediated induction of the ISRE by TLR4 but not TLR3. p65 promoted transactivation of gene expression by IRF-3. TLR4 and TLR3 therefore differ in their mechanism of ISRE induction. Cell Culture, Plasmids, and Reagents—HEK293 and U373 cell lines were purchased from the Centre for Applied Microbiology & Research (Salisbury, UK), the HEK293-TLR3 cell line was kind gift of Katherine Fitzgerald (University of Massachusetts Medical School).

Expression constructs bearing IRF-3 and ΔNIRF-3 were kind gifts of John Hiscott (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). Transfection-based Reporter Gene Assays—HEK293, U373, and MEFs were seeded at 1-2 × 104 cells well-1 in 96-well plates, incubated overnight, and transfected using GeneJuice transfection reagent (Novagen, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions with a total amount of 300 ng of DNA well-1 comprising 100 ng of reporter gene construct, plasmid DNA of interest, and empty vector as filler DNA. For transactivation assays 80 ng of p-55UASGLuc were applied in combination with 100 ng of either Gal4-DBD or Gal4-IRF-3 and additional plasmids as indicated in figure legends. The cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer (Promega, Southampton, UK) for 15 min. At 24 or 48 h post-transfection, the extracts were monitored for firefly luciferase activity following standard protocols. 40 ng well-1Renilla reniformis luciferase construct was used as internal control for transfection efficiency. The activities were expressed as fold activation over unstimulated empty vector controls (ctrl). The experiments were carried out in triplicate with error bars indicating standard deviations. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—U373 cells were grown in 15-cm dishes and treated as indicated in figure legends, and their nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described with minor modifications (27Yamaguchi S. Murata Y. Nagaya T. Hayashi Y. Ohmori S. Nimura Y. Seo H. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 22: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Specifically, the samples were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer (80 strokes at 4 °C). Following the addition of the high salt buffer, the samples were rotated for 30 min at 4 °C. 10 μg of nuclear protein was incubated for 30 min with 10,000 cpm of double-stranded [γ-32P]ATP ISRE oligonucleotide (5′-GAT CGG GAA AGG GAA ACC GAA ACT GAA-3′) in hybridization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, and 100μg ml-1 nuclease free bovine serum albumin) containing 2 μg ml-1 of poly(dI-dC) as nonspecific competitor. Supershifting antibodies specific for p65 (SC-8008X) and IRF-3 (SC-9082X) were added to the nuclear extracts 1 h prior to hybridization with the oligonucleotide. The samples were kept on ice at all stages. Protein-DNA complexes were run on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel, and complex formation was detected with autoradiography. The TLR4 Adaptors MyD88 and Mal Enhance ISRE-dependent Gene Expression—We were interested in comparing IRF-3 activation by TLR4 and TLR3. To examine this process we used three systems comprising transfection of HEK293 cells with a CD4-TLR4 fusion protein, which is constitutively active, HEK293 cells rendered sensitive to poly(I-C) by stable transfection with TLR3, and addition of the ligands LPS and poly(I-C) to U373 cells, which express TLR3 and TLR4 constitutively. Fig. 1A demonstrates that transfection with a plasmid encoding a dominant negative version of IRF-3 blocked CD4-TLR4 and TLR3/poly(I-C)-stimulated induction of a reporter gene, luciferase, linked to five ISRE sites from the ISG15 promoter (left-hand panel) but did not inhibit the expression of luciferase linked to five NF-κB-binding sites (right-hand panel). These results indicate that the ISRE luciferase response involves IRF-3. We next probed the link between the adaptors MyD88, Mal, and TRIF with IRF-3. Fig. 1B demonstrates how overexpression of each of the proteins on their own affected ISRE- or κB-linked reporter gene expression. In agreement with other studies (10Oshiumi H. Matsumoto M. Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar, 11Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar) expression of TRIF led to the strongest activation of the ISRE, causing a 200-fold induction over controls. By comparison, MyD88 and Mal had only marginal effects on the ISRE but were much better inducers of NF-κB when compared with TRIF. Overexpression of IRF-3 only induced the ISRE response. However, as shown in Fig. 1C, when concentrations of Mal or MyD88 unable to activate the ISRE were co-expressed with IRF-3, a clear synergy was observed in ISRE induction (Fig. 1C, left-hand panel). Mal enhanced the IRF-3 alone response by 5-fold, whereas MyD88 had a 7-fold effect. IRF-3 had no effect on NF-κB either alone or in combination with Mal or MyD88, as expected (Fig. 1C, right-hand panel). NF-κB Is Required for IRF-3 Activation by LPS but Not poly(I-C)—The synergism observed between MyD88 or Mal and IRF-3 with respect to ISRE activation suggested that TLR4 signaling to IRF-3 might involve NF-κB, because Mal and MyD88 are both NF-κB activators. To examine this we tested specific inhibitors of the NF-κB pathway for their effects on TLR4-mediated and, for comparison, TLR3-mediated signal transduction to the ISRE. We used IκB-SR, a mutant form of IκBα (S32A/S36A), which cannot undergo phosphorylation and acts as a super-repressor of NF-κB, and a kinase inactive mutant of IKK 2 (IKK2KA), which acts as a dominant negative inhibitor. Interestingly, both agents inhibited CD4-TLR4-stimulated ISRE and, as expected, NF-κB-mediated gene induction (Fig. 2A). Strikingly, neither had an effect on ISRE activation by poly(I-C) in TLR3-transfected HEK293 cells but, as expected, blocked NF-κB activation, although the inhibitory effect of IKK2KA reached a maximum of only 50% (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained when ISRE- and κB-dependent expression was measured in U373 cells. LPS-mediated activation of the ISRE was repressed by both IKK2KA and IκB-SR, whereas the effect of poly(I-C) was not impaired by either of these agents (Fig. 2C, left-hand panel). NF-κB activation by LPS and poly(I-C) in U373 was blocked by both IKK2KA and IκB-SR (right-hand panel) with IKK2KA again having a lesser effect than the IκB-SR on the poly(I-C) response. TLR4 Fails to Induce ISRE-dependent Gene Expression in the Absence of p65—We further tested the significance of NF-κB in the TLR4 response using p65-deficient cells. Fig. 3 (left-hand panel) demonstrates how CD4-TLR4 activates NF-κB in wild type MEFs, whereas the effect in p65-deficient MEFs was impaired, as expected. TLR3 signaling to NF-κB activated by poly(I-C) in MEFs transfected with TLR3 was decreased in p65-deficient cells. Importantly, a different result was obtained using the ISRE luciferase construct, as shown in Fig. 3 (right-hand panel). The ISRE response to TLR4 was almost abolished in the p65-deficient MEFs relative to wild type controls. We were unable to test LPS itself on MEFs because in wild type cells the activation of the ISRE was marginal (data not shown). The effect of poly(I-C), however, was similar in wild type and in p65-deficient cells. This result provides additional evidence that NF-κB, and in particular the p65 subunit, is required for signaling by TLR4 but not TLR3 to the ISRE. p65 Interacts with IRF-3 at the ISRE and Promotes Transactivation—We next tested whether p65 was part of the IRF-3-containing ISRE activation complex. We used the ISRE from the ISG15 promoter (as used in the ISRE luciferase construct) in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay on nuclear extracts from LPS- or poly(I-C)-stimulated U373 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, we observed complex formation at the ISRE oligonucleotide following stimulation with either LPS (lane 4) or poly(I-C) (lane 7). Incubation of the extract with an IRF-3-specific antibody abolished DNA binding, confirming the presence of IRF-3 in each complex (lanes 5 and 8). Importantly, a p65-specific antibody prevented ISRE complex formation in extracts from LPS-treated cells (lane 6) but had only a marginal effect on extracts from poly(I-C)-treated cells (lane 9). The supershifting ability of the p65-specific antibody was confirmed with a κB site-containing oligonucleotide and LPS-stimulated U373 and THP-1 nuclear cell extracts (data not shown).Fig. 4Interaction between NF-κB and IRF-3.A, nuclear extracts prepared from 105 U373 cells treated for 6 h with LPS (1 μg/ml) or poly(I-C) (25 μg/ml) or left untreated were analyzed in a electrophoretic mobility shift assay using an oligonucleotide comprising the ISRE from the ISG15 promoter. The arrow indicates protein/DNA complexes. The extracts were preincubated with antibodies against IRF-3 or p65 as indicated. These results are representative of three separate experiments. B, 106 HEK293 cells were co-transfected with a construct bearing the Gal4 upstream activation sequence fused to the luciferase reporter gene (100 ng), an expression vector for Gal4-IRF-3 (80 ng), or the Gal4 DNA-binding domain on its own Gal4-DBD (80 ng) and expression vector for p65 in increasing amounts (5, 25, and 50 ng). C, 106 HEK293 cells transfected with Gal4 luciferase construct (100 ng), the expression vector for Gal4-IRF-3 (80 ng), and p65 (50 ng) were additionally transfected with expression vectors for the dominant negative form of IKK2 (IKK2KA 20 ng) and the IκB-SR (20 ng). D, 0.5× 106 wild type MEFs (wt) or MEFs with bearing a deletion of IFNAR1 (IFNAR1-/-) were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates and transfected with 100 ng of the ISRE-or the κB luciferase constructs and with either CD4-TLR4 (60 ng) or hTLR3 (0.5 ng) for 24 h. The cells transfected with hTLR3 were stimulated with 1μg/ml poly(I-C) for 7 h. E, IFNAR1-/- MEFs were co-transfected with ISRE luciferase, CD4-TLR4, or hTLR3, respectively, and increasing doses of IκB-SR (10 ng and 30 ng). Unstimulated cells transfected with an empty vector were used as control (ctrl). In all experiments cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase reporter gene activity, and the obtained values were normalized against the R. reniformis luciferase activity for transfection efficiency. Luciferase activity in cells transfected with a Gal4-DBD expression vector was in all cases below the control values of cells transfected with the Gal4-IRF-3 construct. The data shown are the means ± standard deviations of triplicate determinations. The results shown are representative of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also addressed what role p65 might have on the functioning of IRF-3. For this we used an IRF-3 transactivation assay. This assay involved transfecting cells with a plasmid encoding a fusion protein comprising the transactivation domain of IRF-3 fused to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4. When activated, this fusion protein drives a Gal4-controlled luciferase reporter gene co-transfected into the cells. Fig. 4B demonstrates that increasing expression of p65 in HEK293 cells dose-dependently promoted IRF-3-mediated transactivation. This effect was blocked by the IκB-SR but not the dominant negative IKK2KA (Fig. 4C). Overexpressed IκB-SR presumably sequesters p65 in the cell, thereby preventing it from enhancing IRF-3 transactivation activity. Taken together these data indicate that p65 and IRF-3 interact in a complex at the ISRE as a consequence of TLR4 but not TLR3 signaling and that p65 promotes transactivation by IRF-3. Finally, we wanted to exclude the possibility that activation of the ISRE in our experiments is predominantly driven via a type I interferon feedback loop through activation of ISGF3. We therefore transfected MEFs bearing a targeted disruption of the β subunit of the interferon-α/β receptor (IFNAR1-/- MEFs) and their corresponding wild type MEFs with the κB and ISRE luciferase constructs and tested TLR3 and TLR4 responses. TLR4 and TLR3 signaling to either ISRE or NF-κB was comparable in both IFNAR1-/--deficient and wild type cells (Fig. 4D), indicating that the ISRE construct serves primarily as an IRF-3 read-out. Consistent with our data in HEK293 and U373 cells, upon co-transfection with the IκB-SR only the TLR4-stimulated ISRE response was decreased, whereas TLR3 signaling remained unaltered (Fig. 4E). It should be noted that the parental MEFs of the IFNAR1-/- MEFs, although clearly evident, were less responsive compared with the wild type MEFs, which were the corresponding controls for the p65-deficient cells. The results from this study indicate a difference between TLR4- and TLR3-mediated activation of the ISRE. TLR4 has an absolute requirement for NF-κB in this process, with p65 occurring in the ISRE binding complex with IRF-3, whereas the TLR3-induced ISRE response is NF-κB-independent. We first suspected NF-κB involvement in the pathway to IRF-3 from TLR4 when we observed that Mal or MyD88 synergize with overexpressed IRF-3 in ISRE activation. Both of these adaptors target NF-κB. NF-κB involvement was confirmed by the inhibitory effect of IKK2KA and IκB-SR on the TLR4 response and most compellingly in cells from p65-deficient mice, which were unresponsive in terms of TLR4 signaling to the ISRE but were normal for TLR3. The necessity for cooperation between NF-κB and IRF-3 has been outlined in other studies (14Schafer S.L. Lin R. Moore P.A. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2714-2720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 28Kim T. Kim T.Y. Lee W.G. Yim J. Kim T.K. J. Biol.

Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Interestingly, p65 is redundant for induction of the IFNβ promoter after poly(I-C) data stimulation but is absolutely essential for LPS-stimulated IFNβ expression (30Peters K.L. Smith H.L. Stark G.R. Sen G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6322-6327Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These observations at a minimum indicate that NF-κB and IRF-3 must cooperate in TLR4 signaling but not TLR3 signaling to a gene whose promoter contains an ISRE but also support our evidence for a function for p65 in TLR4- but not in TLR3-mediated ISRE activation. Additionally, in an earlier study it has been shown that the necessity for p65 at the IFNβ promoter could be overcome with a chimera comprising the N-terminal DNA-binding domain of IRF-3 and the N-terminal p65 transactivation domain (14Schafer S.L. Lin R. Moore P.A. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2714-2720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). This again argues for a direct cooperation between IRF-3 and p65 at the ISRE, with the role of p65 to promote transactivation. In support of this model we found that the inhibition of the NF-κB pathway in IFNAR1-/- MEFs cells blocks TLR4 signaling to the ISRE. Additionally, we detected both p65 and IRF-3 in the LPS/TLR4-induced activation complex at the ISRE. An interaction between p65 and IRF-3 at the ISRE could be mediated by the IRF-3 co-activators cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) or p300. IRF-3 relies on recruitment of these co-activators not only to reduce export from the nucleus but moreover for transcriptional activation (15Yoneyama M. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Fukuda M. Nishida E. Fujita T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1087-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 31Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Iwamura T. Yoshimura S. Tamura K. Namiki H. Aimoto S. Fujita T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The histone acetylase function of CBP is vital for binding to the ISRE (32Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Kitabayashi I. Fujita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22304-22313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). CBP has been shown to interact with both IRF-3 and p65 (31Suhara W. Yoneyama M. Iwamura T.

Chem. 2003; 278: 651-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 36Lin C.H. Hare B.J. Wagner G. Harrison S.C. Maniatis T. Fraenkel E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 581-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Simultaneous binding of p65 with IRF-3 could have a synergistic effect and possibly alter the conformation or steric orientation of IRF-3 at CBP to modify transcriptional activity of the complex. It is possible that other subunits of NF-κB, such as c-Rel or RelB, can also bind to this complex and promote ISRE activity, and we are currently investigating their involvement. However, because of the availability of p65-deficient cells, we focused on the role of p65 in this study. The mechanism by which LPS activates IRF-3 via TLR4 is still uncertain, although other studies have also indicated differences between LPS and viral stimuli or poly(I-C) in this process (23Servant M.J. ten Oever B. LePage C. Conti L. Gessani S. Julkunen I. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 355-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 37Servant M.J.

Chow E.K. Yee K. Cheng G. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3565-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). LPS appears to cause N-terminal phosphorylation of IRF-3, whereas the activation induced by poly(I-C) is more potent and results in phosphorylation of the C terminus (23Servant M.J. ten Oever B. LePage C. Conti L. Gessani S. Julkunen I. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 355-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 37Servant M.J.

It is possible that IRF-3 phosphorylated in its C terminus does not require p65 for it to enhance transcription, whereas N-terminally phosphorylated IRF-3 does. Recently, two independent studies have implicated two members of the IKK family, IKKϵ and TANK-binding kinase 1, as crucial mediators in virus- or poly(I-C)-induced IRF-3 activation and have suggested that IKKϵ is an activating kinase for IRF-3 and IRF-7 (25Sharma S. tenOever B.R. Grandvaux N. Zhou G.P. Lin R. Hiscott J. Science. 2003; 300: 1148-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar, 26Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar). This process seems to be separate from any effect these kinases might have on IKK2, which is a substrate for both IKKϵ and TANK-binding kinase 1. IKK2 was shown not to be capable of phosphorylating IRF-3 when immunoprecipitated from cells. Our evidence also rules out a role for IKK2 in the IRF-3 activation process triggered by poly(I-C). With respect to LPS it has been shown that ISRE binding activity induced by LPS in IKKϵ-deficient MEFs was unaltered compared with wild type MEFs, which argues against a role for IKKϵ in LPS-dependent IRF-3 activation, consistent with the evidence that LPS does not cause C-terminal phosphorylation (39Kravchenko V.V. Mathison J.C. Schwamborn K. Mercurio F. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 6: 6Google Scholar). It has, however, been suggested that TRIF is involved in IKKϵ activation (26Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2099) Google Scholar) and is required for IRF-3 activation by LPS, as revealed by the failure of LPS to induce IRF-3 dimerization in TRIF-deficient cells (12Yamamoto M.

Further experiments will be needed to resolve this issue, and it is likely that there is additional complexity in adaptor usage in this process. Furthermore because LPS can still activate the ISRE in the absence of Mal and MyD88 (20Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Sanjo H. Uematsu S. Kaisho T. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Kobayashi M. Fujita T.

IRF-3 activation upon LPS stimulation has also been demonstrated in Gal4-IRF-3 transactivation studies and in nuclear translocation assays (41Navarro L. David M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35535-35538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 42Shinobu N. Iwamura T. Yoneyama M. Yamaguchi K. Suhara W. Fukuhara Y. Amano F. Fujita T. FEBS Lett. 2002; 517: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). How LPS triggers these events is still not known. One possibility we are exploring is that p65 and IRF-3 interact directly, or via CBP as stated above, and is required for these responses. Although the signaling pathways induced by TLR4 and TLR3 therefore differ, both lead to ISRE activation allowing for IFNβ expression. Clearly, the ISRE can be activated by different transcription factor complexes including IRF-7 and ISGF3, a trimeric complex comprising STAT1, STAT2, and IRF-9 (22Lin R. Mamane Y. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2465-2474Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 43Bluyssen A.R. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E.

Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). Its promiscuity may allow for fine-tuning of responses in different biological contexts. It is also possible that the p65/IRF-3 dimer targets an additional set of genes, increasing the repertoire of responses to LPS. LPS induces IRF-3- and NF-κB-dependent production of IFNβ, which in an autocrine manner via the IFNAR1 receptor and ISFG3 activates the ISRE (8Toshchakov V. Jones B.W. Perera P.Y. Thomas K. Cody M.J.

Cheng G. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 3565-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Inhibition of NF-κB could block LPS-stimulated IFNβ production and hence interfere with this positive feedback loop. However, our study points to a more direct effect because cells deficient in the β-chain of the IFNα/β receptor remain responsive to TLR4 and TLR3 signaling. Given our other data demonstrating that p65-depleted cells are impaired in the ISRE response to TLR4 but not TLR3 and that p65 could be detected in the LPS-activated ISRE-binding complex and could promote transactivation by IRF-3, we conclude that LPS directly induces a p65-IRF-3 complex for ISRE activation, whereas the poly(I-C) response is direct only toward IRF-3. In conclusion, our study provides the first demonstration that p65 is absolutely required for activation of the ISRE by TLR4 but not TLR3. The emerging differences in signaling by TLR4 and TLR3 as well as other TLRs will continue to improve our understanding of the fine-tuning of the innate immune response.

https://openalex.org/W2089244852,"Glioblastomas (GBM) are the most frequent and malignant human brain tumor type. Typically striking in adulthood, tumor progression is rapid, relentless, and ultimately leads to the patient's death within a year of diagnosis. The identification of transcriptionally regulated genes can lead to the discovery of targets for antibody or small-molecule-mediated therapy, as well as diagnostic markers. We prepared cDNA arrays that are specifically enriched for genes expressed in human brain tumors and profiled gene expression patterns in 14 individual tumor samples. Out of 25,000 clones arrayed, greater than 200 genes were found transcriptionally induced in glioblastomas compared to normal human brain tissue including the receptor tyrosine phosphatasezeta (RPTPzeta) and one of its ligands, pleiotrophin (Ptn). We confirmed by Northern blot analysis and immunohistochemistry that RPTPzeta is enriched in tumor samples. Knockdown of RPTPzeta by RNA interference studies established a functional role of RPTPzeta in cell migration. Our results suggest a novel function for RPTPzeta in regulating glioblastoma cell motility and point to the therapeutic utility of RPTPzeta as a target for antibody-mediated therapy of brain tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2080132009,"Corin is a cardiac transmembrane serine protease. In cell-based studies, corin converted pro-atrial natriuretic peptide (pro-ANP) to mature ANP, suggesting that corin is potentially the pro-ANP convertase. In this study, we evaluated the importance of the transmembrane domain and activation cleavage in human corin. We showed that a soluble corin that consists of only the extracellular domain was capable of processing recombinant human pro-ANP in cell-based assays. In contrast, a mutation at the conserved activation cleavage site, R801A, abolished the function of corin, demonstrating that the activation cleavage is essential for corin activity. These results allowed us to design, express, and purify a mutant soluble corin, EKsolCorin, that contains an enterokinase recognition sequence at the activation cleavage site. Purified EKsolCorin was activated by enterokinase in a dose-dependent manner. Activated EK-solCorin had hydrolytic activity toward peptide substrates with a preference for Arg and Lys residues in the P-1 position. This activity of EKsolCorin was inhibited by trypsin-like serine protease inhibitors but not inhibitors of chymotrypsin-like, cysteine-, or metallo-proteases. In pro-ANP processing assays, purified active EKsolCorin converted recombinant human pro-ANP to biologically active ANP in a highly sequence-specific manner. The pro-ANP processing activity of EKsolCorin was not inhibited by human plasma. Together, our data indicate that the transmembrane domain is not necessary for the biological activity of corin but may be a mechanism to localize corin at specific sites, whereas the proteolytic cleavage at the activation site is an essential step in controlling the activity of corin.

Corin, however, does not convert pro-C-type natriuretic peptide to mature C-type natriuretic peptide (25Wu C. Wu F. Pan J. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1998; 32: S22-S28Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), which may play a role in angiogenesis and arterial restenosis. The results from these experiments suggest that corin is the pro-ANP/pro-brain natriuretic peptide convertase in the heart. This hypothesis is further supported by additional experiments in which overexpression of an active site mutant corin or transfection of small interfering RNA duplexes directed against the corin gene completely blocked pro-ANP processing in cultured cardiomyocytes (27Wu F. Yan W. Pan J. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16900-16905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To date, however, the reported studies of corin were performed in cell-based experiments, which do not allow elimination of the possibility that other proteins or enzymes might contribute to the observed pro-ANP processing activities. It is important, therefore, to demonstrate directly that corin itself possesses the pro-ANP processing activity by using purified active corin. To test the hypothesis that purified active corin is able to process pro-ANP, we first examined the importance of the transmembrane domain and activation cleavage in corin for its biological activity. Our results showed that the transmembrane domain is not required for corin to process pro-ANP, but proteolytic cleavage of corin at its conserved activation site is essential. Based on these results, we designed, expressed, and purified a soluble form of human corin and studied its biochemical properties. Our results showed that activated soluble human corin hydrolyzed synthetic peptic substrates and activated human pro-ANP in a highly sequence-specific manner.

All other chemical reagents were obtained from Sigma. Expression Vectors—Expression plasmids encoding human wild-type corin (pcDNACorin), active site mutant corin S985A (pcDNACorinS985A), human wild-type pro-ANP (pcDNAproANP), and mutant pro-ANPs R98A (pcDNAproANPR98A), R101A (pcDNAproANPR101A), and R102A (pcDNAproANPR102A) were described previously (21Yan W.

Chem. 2002; 277: 16900-16905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A plasmid vector encoding corin activation cleavage site mutant R801A (pcDNACorinR801A) was constructed by a PCR-based mutagenesis method (QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using pcDNACorin as a template and oligonucleotide primer 5′-CCG AAT GAA CAA AGC AAT CCT TGG AGG TCG-3′. To construct a plasmid expressing a soluble corin, a cDNA fragment containing nucleotides 463–3219 of human corin cDNA (1Yan W. Sheng N. Seto M. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14926-14935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR and inserted into the expression vector pSEC to yield the plasmid pSECsolCorin. This plasmid encodes a protein, WTsolCorin, consisting of an Igκ signal peptide at the N terminus followed by a 919-amino acid sequence from the extracellular region of corin (residues 124–1042) and a viral V5 tag at the C terminus (see Fig. 1). To construct a plasmid encoding a soluble corin that can be activated by EK, PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed using plasmid pSECsolCorin as a template. Nucleotides 2482–2496 (CGA ATG AAC AAA AGG) of human corin cDNA were replaced by nucleotides GAC GAT GAC GAT AAG. The resulting plasmid, pSECEKsolCorin, encodes a soluble corin, EKsolCorin, with the amino acid sequence DDDDK replacing the original sequence RMNKR at the conserved activation cleavage site (see Fig. 1). All plasmid constructs were verified by restriction enzyme digestion and direct DNA sequencing. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Western Analysis of Pro-ANP Processing—HEK 293 cells were cultured in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The conditioned medium was collected 12–16 h after transfection and subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 rpm to remove cell debris. The cells were lysed in a buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1% Triton X-100. To analyze pro-ANP processing, the conditioned medium containing recombinant wild-type or mutant pro-ANPs was incubated with purified soluble corin (1.8 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 4 h. Recombinant human pro-ANP and its derivatives in the conditioned medium were immunoprecipitated by an anti-V5 antibody. The protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-V5 antibody. On Western blots under reducing conditions, recombinant human corin zymogen, the corin protease domain, pro-ANP, and ANP migrate as bands of ∼150, ∼35, ∼24, and ∼7 kDa, respectively. Expression and Purification of EKsolCorin—HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with the expression vector pSECEKsolCorin and a plasmid expressing the neomycin resistance gene using LipofectAMINE 2000. Stable clones were selected in α-minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 500 μg/ml G418 and screened by Western blotting using an anti-V5 antibody for corin protein expression. Positive clones were adapted for growth in serum-free OPTI-MEM I medium containing 500 μg/ml G418. The conditioned medium was collected, passed through a 0.2-μm filter, and dialyzed against Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl) using a Dialyze Direct L Module (Qiagen). The medium was loaded onto a 23-ml nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Qiagen) that was subsequently washed with Buffer A containing 10 mm imidazole and eluted with a 10–250 mm imidazole linear gradient in Buffer A. The fractions containing soluble corin were identified by Western blotting and combined. The pooled fractions were then diluted 1:3 in Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and loaded onto a 5-ml Hi Trap Q Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was equilibrated with Buffer B containing 100 mm NaCl, washed with Buffer B containing 200 mm NaCl, and eluted with a 200–750 mm NaCl linear gradient in Buffer B. The fractions containing the soluble corin, EKsolCorin, were identified by Western blotting and pooled. The purified protein was further characterized by Coomassie Blue staining, analytical size exclusion chromatography, and N-terminal protein sequencing. Activation of EKsolCorin by Recombinant EK—To activate the recombinant soluble corin, EKsolCorin, 2.5 μg of purified EKsolCorin protein was incubated with increasing concentrations of recombinant EK (1–10 units/ml) in 100 μl of Activation buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2) at 25 °C for 2 h. The samples (2 μl) were taken and analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions followed by Western blotting using an anti-V5 antibody. For activation of large batches, 1 mg of purified EKsolCorin in 40 ml of activation buffer was incubated with 300 units of recombinant EK at 25 °C for 3 h. To remove the recombinant EK, 11 ml of EKapture beads were added to the solution and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. EKapture beads were removed by centrifugation (1,000 rpm, 10 min), and the supernatant was collected and stored at -20 °C until further use. EK was removed from the EKsolCorin preparation to below the limit of detection when analyzed by both SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining and by HPLC-based analytical size exclusion chromatography. As another control, an assay buffer without corin protein underwent the same EK activation and removal procedures. Enzyme Kinetics—Kinetic constants were determined using a panel of selected synthetic chromogenic substrates. For each assay, which was carried out in 96-well plates, 50 μl of substrates (final concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 2 mm in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2) were mixed with 50 μl of activated EKsolCorin (final concentration of 58 nm). The plates were incubated at 37 °C and read at 405-nm wavelength over 15 min at 20-s intervals in a Spectra MAX 250 plate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). In these experiments, controls included purified EKsolCorin that was not activated by EK and an assay buffer that underwent the same EK treatment and removal procedures. Readings from the controls, which were minimal, were subtracted as the background. In addition, plasmin (for S-2222, S-2251, S-2302, S-2366, S-2403, and S-2444), kallikrein (for S-2266 and S-2288), thrombin (for S-2238), trypsin (for S-2765), and elastase (for S-2484) were used as positive controls under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The Km and Vmax values were determined by Line-weaver-Burk double-reciprocal plot. Each enzymatic assay was carried out in triplicate and repeated at least twice. Effects of Protease Inhibitors—Effects of protease inhibitors on EK-solCorin were tested in an assay using the chromogenic substrate S-2403. In each experiment, 45 μl of activated EKsolCorin (final concentration of 104 nm) was mixed with 5 μl of an inhibitor (final concentrations ranging from 0.1 μm to 20 mm) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. To measure the remaining hydrolytic activity of EKsolCorin, 50 μl of S-2403 (final concentration of 500 μm) was added to the mixture, and the absorbance was measured at 405 nm after 2 h. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice. cGMP Assay—To examine the biological activity of corin-processed recombinant ANP, a cGMP assay was performed using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Biotrak; Amersham Biosciences), as described previously (27Wu F. Yan W. Pan J. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16900-16905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In these experiments, synthetic human ANP (Peninsula Laboratories Inc., San Carlos, CA) was used as a standard. Each experimental condition was assayed in triplicate. Processing of Pro-ANP by Wild Type and a Soluble Corin, WTsolCorin—To examine the importance of the transmembrane domain of corin for its pro-ANP processing activity, we constructed a plasmid that encodes a soluble form of human corin containing all of the extracellular domains (Fig. 1). Recombinant wild-type corin, active site mutant corin S985A, and the soluble corin, WTsolCorin, were expressed transiently in HEK 293 cells. Wild-type corin and active site mutant corin S985A were detected by Western analysis in the cell lysate but not in the conditioned medium (Fig. 2A), consistent with corin being a transmembrane protein. In contrast, WTsolCorin was detected in both the cell lysate and conditioned medium (Fig. 2A), confirming that the soluble corin was secreted from the cells. We determined the activity of these recombinant corins in pro-ANP processing in co-transfection experiments using a plasmid expressing human pro-ANP together with plasmids expressing either wild-type corin, mutant corin S985A, or WT-solCorin. Pro-ANP and its derivatives in the conditioned medium were analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2B, pro-ANP, but not ANP, was detected in the cell lysate. In the conditioned medium, conversion of pro-ANP to ANP was observed when cells were transfected with the pro-ANP expressing plasmid together with plasmids expressing wild-type corin or WTsolCorin. As controls, the cells were co-transfected with the pro-ANP expressing construct and a plasmid expressing either active site mutant corin S985A or a control vector. Without the presence of a plasmid expressing an active corin, no pro-ANP processing was detected, showing that the cells do not contain any detectable endogenous pro-ANP processing activity. The results indicate that the transmembrane domain of corin is not necessary for the pro-ANP processing activity in this cell-based assay. Processing of Pro-ANP by Wild-type Corin and Activation Cleavage Site Mutant Corin R801A—The human corin protein contains a conserved activation cleavage sequence Arg-Ile-Leu-Gly-Gly at residues 801–805 (1Yan W. Sheng N. Seto M. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14926-14935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). To examine the functional importance of the activation cleavage of human corin, we constructed a plasmid expressing a mutant that would have impaired activation (activation cleavage site mutant corin R801A; Fig. 1). Co-transfection experiments were performed using a plasmid expressing pro-ANP together with plasmids expressing either wild-type corin, active site mutant corin S985A, or activation cleavage site mutant corin R801A. Recombinant corin proteins were present in the cell lysate but not in the conditioned medium (Fig. 3A). Recombinant pro-ANP was detected in the cell lysate after transfection with the pro-ANP expressing plasmid (Fig. 3B, left panel). In the conditioned medium, processing of pro-ANP to ANP was observed when cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding wild-type corin but not those encoding mutant corins S985A and R801A or a control vector (Fig. 3B, right panel). The results demonstrate that proteolytic cleavage at Arg801 is required for the pro-ANP processing activity of corin. The fact that wild-type corin was capable of processing pro-ANP in cell-based transfection experiments indicates that some corin molecules must be activated. In the Western analysis (Figs. 2 and 3), however, we were unable to detect the cleaved protease fragment from wild-type corin or mutant corin S985A, which is expected to migrate as a band at ∼35 kDa under reducing conditions. This would suggest that the number of activated corin molecules is a low fraction of the overall amount of corin. Effects of Thrombin, Factor Xa, and Kallikrein on Corin Activation—To examine whether plasma-derived serine proteases could activate corin, we examined the effects of thrombin, blood clotting factor Xa, and kallikrein on corin activation. Recombinant human wild-type corin was stably expressed in HEK 293 cells. Purified human plasma thrombin, factor Xa, or kallikrein was added to the cell culture and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting under reducing conditions. The results showed that recombinant human corin was not cleaved in cells treated with either thrombin, factor Xa, or kallikrein (data not shown). We also added thrombin, factor Xa, or kallikrein directly to 293 cell lysates containing recombinant corin and analyzed the corin protein by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Again, no activation cleavage of corin was detected in these experiments (data not shown). Expression and Purification of Soluble EK-activable Corin, EKsolCorin—To produce an active soluble corin for further biochemical studies, we designed a mutant corin, EKsolCorin, in which an EK recognition sequence (DDDDK) (7Kitamoto Y. Yuan X. Wu Q. McCourt D.W. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7588-7592Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) was used to replace the activation cleavage sequence of human corin (RMNKR) (1Yan W. Sheng N. Seto M. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14926-14935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines expressing EKsolCorin were established. The conditioned medium from these cells was collected, and EKsolCorin was purified by nickel affinity and ion exchange chromatography. SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blotting using an anti-V5 antibody showed that EKsolCorin migrated as a single band at ∼150 kDa under reducing conditions and at ∼145 kDa under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 4). The results were consistent with the calculated mass of ∼108 kDa for EKsolCorin, which also contained 19 potential N-linked glycosylation sites (1Yan W. Sheng N. Seto M. Morser J. Wu Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14926-14935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). HPLC-based gel filtration chromatography showed that the purified EKsolCorin had a purity of >98% (data not shown). The N-terminal sequence of EKsolCorin was confirmed by protein sequencing. The purified protein was quantified by UV spectrometry at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient (1 mg/ml) of 1.45 calculated from the protein sequence. Activation of EKsolCorin by EK—Purified EKsolCorin protein was activated with increasing concentrations of recombinant EK at 25 °C for 2 h. The protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions followed by Western analysis using an anti-V5 antibody. As shown in Fig. 5, EKsolCorin was activated by recombinant EK in a dose-dependent manner. Under nonreducing conditions, EKsolCorin appeared as a single band of ∼145 kDa. Under reducing conditions, activated EKsolCorin migrated as two fragments: an N-terminal propeptide (∼115 kDa) and a C-terminal protease domain (∼35 kDa) (Fig. 1). Because the V5 tag is located at the C terminus, the anti-V5 antibody detected only the C-terminal protease domain once EKsolCorin was activated (Fig. 5). Enzymatic Properties of Soluble Corin—Substrate specificity and kinetic constants of EKsolCorin for a panel of selected peptide substrates were determined using purified and activated EKsolCorin. As controls, EKsolCorin without EK activation and a buffer that was treated with EK were included. Initial experiments showed that activated EKsolCorin, but not the zymogen form of EKsolCorin or the buffer control, hydrolyzed some chromogenic substrates (S-2222, S-2302, S-2366, S-2403, and S-2444). No significant hydrolysis of substrates S-2238 (H-d-Phe-Pip-Arg-pNA·2HCl), S-2251 (H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-pNA·2HCl), S-2266 (H-d-Val-Leu-Arg-pNA·2HCl), S-2288 (H-d-Ile-Pro-Arg-pNA·2HCl), S-2484 (pyroGlu-Pro-Val-pNA), and S-2765 (N-α-Z-d-Arg-Gly-Arg-pNA·2HCl) was detected (Km values were >50 mm). This profile was very different from that of recombinant bovine light chain EK used in this study (data not shown), indicating that the observed activity was not derived from any potential contamination of EK. We further determined the kinetics of EKsolCorin-mediated hydrolysis of the substrates S-2403, S-2366, S-2302, S-2222, and S-2444 (Table I). The results showed that EKsolCorin cleaved peptide substrates with either Arg or Lys at the P-1 position. For example, the Km values were 1.28 ± 0.46 and 3.52 ± 1.07 mm for S-2403 and S-2366, respectively. Pro, Phe, and Gly residues appeared to be preferred at the P-2 position, and a pyro-Glu residue, an analog of small neutral amino acids, seemed to be preferred at the P-3 position. The overall results are consistent with the corin cleavage sequence (Thr-Ala-Pro-Arg ↓ Ser) in human pro-ANP (28Koller K.J. Goeddel D.V.

The majority of cytoplasmic TRAF2-GFP and, to a lesser extent, TRAF3-GFP, but not TRAF1-GFP or TRAF4-GFP, translocated into CD40 signaling complexes within a few minutes after CD40 triggering with the CD40 ligand. The inhibitor of apoptosis proteins cIAP1 and cIAP2 were also recruited by TRAF2 to sites of CD40 signaling. An excess of TRAF2 allowed recruitment of TRAF1-GFP to sites of CD40 signaling, whereas an excess of TRAF1 abrogated the interaction of TRAF2 and CD40. Overexpression of TRAF1, however, had no effect on the interaction of TRADD and TRAF2, known to be important for tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1)-mediated NF-κB activation. Accordingly, TRAF1 inhibited CD40-dependent but not TNF-R1-dependent NF-κB activation. Moreover, down-regulation of TRAF1 with small interfering RNAs enhanced CD40/CD40 ligand-induced NF-κB activation but showed no effect on TNF signaling. Because of the trimeric organization of TRAF proteins, we propose that the stoichiometry of TRAF1-TRAF2 heteromeric complexes ((TRAF2)2-TRAF1 versus TRAF2-(TRAF1)2) determines their capability to mediate CD40 signaling but has no major effect on TNF signaling.

Libby P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 4-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aside from T- and B-cells, CD40 and CD40L are expressed in a variety of non-lymphocytic cell types including monocytes, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle, and endothelial cells (1.Schonbeck U. Libby P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 4-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CD40/CD40L system plays a critical role in the regulation of thymus-dependent humoral immune responses but also contributes to chronic inflammatory processes in autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative disorders, graft-versus-host disease, cancer, and atherosclerosis (1.Schonbeck U.

In addition, triggering of CD40 leads to Janus family kinase 3 (Jak3)-dependent activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins and to activation of the Src-related tyrosine kinase Lyn (3.Hanissian S.H.

TRAF proteins couple TNF receptors and Toll/interleukin-1 receptor family members to pathways leading to the activation of the inhibitor of I-κB kinases and kinases of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family (2.Wajant H. Henkler F. Scheurich P. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). All members of the TRAF family share a conserved C-terminal homology domain of ∼180 amino acids (TRAF domain), which mediates interactions with the above mentioned receptors and the majority of cytosolic factors known for their TRAF binding capacity, including kinases, inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, and death domain adaptor proteins (2.Wajant H. Henkler F. Scheurich P. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). With the exception of TRAF1, the N-terminal domain of all six known mammalian TRAFs comprise a single RING finger followed by several zinc finger motifs (2.Wajant H. Henkler F. Scheurich P. Cell.

As TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 have the capability to stimulate NF-κB- and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, the two TRAF binding sites of CD40 may, in principle, allow redundant activation of these pathways. For TRAF3, a negative regulatory role in CD40-induced differentiation of B-cells and an involvement in CD40-mediated activation of JNK and p38 (19.Grammer A.C. Swantek J.L. McFarland R.D. Miura Y. Geppert T. Lipsky P.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1183-1193PubMed Google Scholar) have been described. TRAF6 has to been shown to contribute to CD40-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase via a Ras-independent pathway (20.Kashiwada M. Shirakata Y. Inoue J.I. Nakano H. Okazaki K. Okumura K. Yamamoto T. Nagaoka H. Takemori T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although there is ample evidence that CD40 can signal NF-κB activation by at least two independent pathways mediated by either TRAF2 or TRAF6 (see above), splenocytes from both TRAF2 (21.Nguyen L.T. Duncan G.S. Mirtsos C. Ng M. Speiser D.E. Shahinian A. Marino M.W. Mak T.W. Ohashi P.S. Yeh W.C.

CD40-dependent activation of NF-κB or JNK is apparently normal in TRAF5 deficient mice; nevertheless B cells from these mice showed defects in proliferation, compromised in vitro immunoglobulin production, and reduced up-regulation of various surface molecules including CD23, CD54, CD80, CD86, and Fas (23.Nakano H. Sakon S. Koseki H. Takemori T. Tada K. Matsumoto M. Munechika E. Sakai T. Shirasawa T. Akiba H. Kobata T. Santee S.M. Ware C.F. Rennert P.D. Taniguchi M. Yagita H. Okumura K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9803-9808Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The contribution of TRAF3 to CD40 signaling in vivo is poorly understood. B cells from TRAF3-deficient mice proliferate normally after CD40 triggering but have a defect in isotype switching in response to thymus-dependent antigens (24.Xu Y. Cheng G. Baltimore D. Immunity. 1996; 5: 407-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). B-cells of TRAF1 knock-out mice are largely unaffected with respect to CD40 signaling (25.Tsitsikov E.N. Laouini D. Dunn I.F. Sannikova T.Y. Davidson L. Alt F.W. Geha R.S. Immunity. 2001; 15: 647-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) whereas CD40L-matured bone marrow-derived dendritic cells exert reduced CD40-mediated NF-κB upon restimulation (26.Arron J.R. Pewzner-Jung Y. Walsh M.C. Kobayashi T. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 923-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In contrast, NF-κB activation by the CD40-related TNF-R2 is enhanced in T-cells of TRAF1-deficient mice (25.Tsitsikov E.N. Laouini D. Dunn I.F. Sannikova T.Y. Davidson L. Alt F.W. Geha R.S. Immunity. 2001; 15: 647-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Interpretation of data obtained from the study of TRAF-deficient mice is partly confounded by the fact that this group of molecules is commonly used by several members of the TNF receptor family. However, two studies with mutated CD40 transgenes lacking the TRAF2/3 and/or TRAF6 binding site confirmed the above-mentioned pivotal role of TRAF2 for CD40-mediated activation of NF-κB, JNK, and p38 kinase (27.Jabara H.

Here we show in living cells that TRAF2 secondarily recruits TRAF1 and the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis (cIAP) proteins cIAP1 and cIAP2 to sites of CD40 signaling. TRAF1 interfered with TRAF2 recruitment to sites of CD40 signaling and diminished CD40-mediated NF-κB activation, whereas down-regulation of TRAF1 enhanced this response. These data suggest that CD40-mediated NF-κB activation is regulated by the stoichiometry of TRAF1-TRAF2 heteromeric complexes. Cells and Reagents—The human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa and HEK293 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI medium (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) supplemented with 5% FCS. HeLa transfectants stably expressing TRAF1 have been described previously elsewhere (29.Schwenzer R. Siemienski K. Liptay S. Schubert G. Peters N. Scheurich P. Schmid R.M. Wajant H. J. Biol.

IKK1-YFP was a kind gift by Johannes Schmid (University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria). All other chimeric proteins containing GFP, YFP, or CFP were generated by standard cloning techniques with proofreading polymerase and the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech). Thus, in all these chimeras the GFP part is localized C-terminally. In case of the TRAF proteins, chimeras with N-terminal GFP have also been investigated but showed no difference when compared with the variants mentioned above. FLAG-tagged CD40L comprises the extracellular domain of human CD40L (amino acids 116-261) fused with an N-terminal FLAG tag by a linker of six amino acids. The small interfering RNA oligonucleotides (siRNAs) were a kind gift from Hans-Peter Vornlocher and Philipp Hadwiger (Ribopharma AG, Kulmbach, Germany). Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Cells (106 cells/ml) were electroporated (4-mm cuvette; 250 V, 1800 μF, maximal resistance) in a medium with 5% FCS and seeded onto 13-mm glass coverslips in six-well dishes or in glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA). For an on-line analysis of CD40 signaling complex formation, cells expressing GFP/YFP/CFP chimeras were stimulated with FLAG-tagged soluble CD40L (sCD40L) crosslinked with 1 μg/ml anti-FLAG mAb M2 (Sigma) and maintained in a conditioned chamber (37 °C; 5% CO2) for up to 2 h on the microscope stage. Fluorescent specimens were analyzed with a Leica SP2 confocal microscope and imaged using the Leica TCS software. For colocalization of endogenous CD40 and GFP fusion proteins, transfected cells were stimulated with crosslinked sCD40L. To detect CD40 in non-stimulated cells, samples were fixed (15 min, 3% paraformaldehyde), washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked with 5% FCS (30 min at room temperature). Fixed cells were incubated with sCD40L (200 ng/ml) and anti-FLAG mAb M2 (1 μg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature and, after six washes, M2 was detected with 1:500 diluted mouse IgG-specific antisera conjugated with Alexa Fluor 546 (A-11060) (1 h at room temperature). After nine washes, cells were finally mounted onto microscope slides. Cells already stimulated with sCD40L/M2 were prepared the same way but without additional sCD40L/M2 treatment after fixation. For counting experiments of the recruitment of YFP/CFP-labeled proteins to sCD40L-stimulated CD40 and TRADD filaments, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated proteins. The next day, the portion of successfully transfected cells with clear recruitment of YFP/CFP-labeled proteins to CD40 or TRADD filaments, respectively, were counted in at least three independent samples. Reporter Gene Assay—HEK293, HeLa, or HeLa cells stably transfected with TRAF1 (20 × 103) were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates. The following day cells were transfected with a 3×NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid (35 ng/well) and a SV40 promoter-driven β-galactosidase expression plasmid (15 ng/well) to normalize the transfection efficiency along with the indicated mixtures of empty vector and the constructs of interest (200 ng/well). Transfections were performed with SuperFect reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The next day, cell extracts were prepared by the addition of 50 μl of luciferase lysis solution (Galactolight-Kit, Tropix, Bedford, MA) and one freeze-thaw cycle. A portion of the extracts (25 μl) was mixed with 50 μl of luciferase substrate (luciferase assay system from Promega), and the luminescence was determined in the single photon mode using an Anthos microplate luminometer (Lucy 2). In parallel, 25 μl of each cell extract was incubated for 1 h with a 1:100 dilution of Galacton substrate in reaction buffer and mixed with 100 μl of accelerator II solution to determine relative β-galactosidase activity (Galactolight-Kit, Tropix), again using the Lucy 2 luminometer. Luciferase activities were normalized based on the β-galactosidase activities. Western Blotting—For Western blot analyses of TRAF1 and TRAF2, a defined number of cells were lysed in lysis buffer (105 cells per 100 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (4 °C for 10 min at 13,000 rpm). Equivalents of the indicated cell numbers were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline-Tween-20 (0.05%) for 1 h and probed with TRAF1-specific (rabbit polyclonal antibody H-125; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) or TRAF2-specific (mAb C90-481; Pharmingen, Hamburg, Germany) antibodies. The antibody-antigen complexes were finally visualized with alkaline phosphatase-labeled secondary antibodies (0.1 μg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP) and nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) as substrates. Analysis of TRAF1/TRAF2 Heterocomplexes by Immunoprecipitation—8 × 105 HEK293 cells were transfected with 5 μg of DNA (ratios of plasmids are indicated in Fig. 2E), using the SuperFect reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen). Cells were harvested 2 days post-transfection and lysed for 30 min on ice in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and a mixture of standard protease inhibitors. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (15 min at 13,000 rpm), and 75 μl of each lysate was kept for analysis of protein expression levels. Lysates were incubated with 2 μg of a TRAF1-directed rabbit antiserum (H-186; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) under rotation for 1.5 h at 4 Co. Protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences; 3 μl per sample) was then added to each sample, and the incubation was continued for another hour. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times in lysis buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting. RNA Interference Experiments—siRNAs specific for nucleotides 406-426 (TRAF1-1) and 1034-1054 (TRAF1-2) of TRAF1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_005658), nucleotides 843-863 (S11) of pEGFP-C1 (GenBank™ accession number U55673), and nucleotides 2610-2630 (K4) of the neomycin-phosphotransferase gene of pEGFP-C1 (GenBank™ accession number U55673) were synthesized as described elsewhere (31.Siegmund D. Hadwiger P. Pfizenmaier K. Vornlocher H.P. Wajant H. Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 725-732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To introduce the siRNAs along with various plasmids into cells, the cells were transfected with plasmid and 150 nm of the indicated siRNAs by electroporation (2-10 × 106 cells/ml; 4-mm cuvette; 250 V, 1800 μF, maximum resistance) in culture medium with 5% FCS using an Easyject Plus (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany) or Superfect according to the supplier's recommendations. CD40L-induced Recruitment of TRAF Proteins in Living Cells—To investigate the recruitment of various cytoplasmic signaling intermediates to the CD40 signaling complex in intact living cells, we transiently transfected HeLa cells stably expressing CD40 with constructs encoding GFP/YFP-tagged forms of the proteins of interest in glass-bottomed dishes. The next day, cells were stimulated with anti-FLAG mAb-crosslinked recombinant soluble N-terminal FLAG-tagged CD40L and monitored on-line in a conditioned chamber (37 °C; 5% CO2) by confocal microscopy with respect to intracellular distribution of GFP fusion proteins. In unstimulated cells, GFP/YFP-tagged TRAF1, TRAF2, TRAF3, and TRAF4 were mainly localized in the cytoplasm and excluded from the nucleus. In cells stimulated with crosslinked sCD40L, TRAF2-YFP (Fig. 1A, middle row) and, to a lesser extent, TRAF3-GFP (Fig. 1A, bottom row), but not TRAF1-GFP or TRAF4-GFP, became compartmentalized in small membrane-localized aggregates (Fig. 1A, top row). sCD40L-induced aggregation of TRAF2-YFP and TRAF3-GFP occurred in all transfected cells independently of the individual expression levels of the chimeric proteins within 5-10 min (data not shown). Staining of sCD40L by detection of its FLAG tag showed extensive co-localization with TRAF2-GFP and TRAF3-GFP only in the TRAF2/3-GFP aggregates of CD40-stimulated cells (Fig. 1B). As crosslinked sCD40L activates CD40 and activated CD40, in turn, interacts strongly with TRAF2 and TRAF3 (13.Ishida T. Mizushima S. Azuma S. Kobayashi N. Tojo T. Suzuki K. Aizawa S. Watanabe T.

The marked preference of sCD40L/CD40 complexes to interact with TRAF2-GFP and TRAF3-GFP is in good agreement with data from the literature showing superior binding of in vitro translated TRAF2 and TRAF3 to recombinant CD40-GST as compared with other TRAFs. Moreover, in surface plasmon resonance analyses of the recombinant TRAF domains of TRAF2 and TRAF3 and the immobilized cytoplasmic domain of CD40, Kd-values of 2.5 and 15 μm have been reported, whereas no detectable interaction was found with TRAF1 and TRAF6 (17.Leo E.

The next day, CD40 signaling was initiated using soluble FLAG-tagged CD40L (200 ng/ml) crosslinked with anti-FLAG mAb M2 (α Flag; 1 μg/ml). The distribution of the GFP-tagged proteins was analyzed by on-line confocal microscopy using a conditioned chamber (37 °C; 5% CO2) both prior to stimulation and for a further 20 min after stimulation. The TRAF2-YFP emission was recorded in the GFP channel (510-560 nm) and therefore appears green. B and D, HeLa-CD40 cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding the indicated proteins. The following day, non-stimulated and sCD40L/M2-stimulated cells (10 min) were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Endogenous CD40 expression was detected by staining FLAG-tagged sCD40L with M2 and PE-labeled anti-murine IgG. In contrast to stimulated cells, non-stimulated cells were fixed not after but prior to incubation and staining with sCD40L. Emission of both the GFP and the YFP chimeras were recorded between 510 and 560 nm.

To analyze cIAP1 and cIAP2, we have used, in most experiments, C-terminal deletion mutants (cIAP1/2ΔC) of these molecules that lack the RING finger domain but can still interact with TRAF1 and TRAF2 via their N-terminal BIR domains. These deletion mutants were more efficiently expressed than their parental counterparts, most likely due to the lack of an E3 ligase activity located in the C termini of cIAP1 and cIAP2, mediating their own degradation via the proteasome (32.Yang Y.

However, upon cotransfection with non-tagged TRAF2, both cIAP1ΔC-GFP and cIAP2ΔC-GFP were predominantly relocated to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C, middle and bottom row). This is in accordance with published data suggesting that cIAP1/2 and TRAF2 are parts of a preformed cytoplasmic complex (34.Shu H.B. Takeuchi M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Transfected cIAP1/2-GFP (data not shown) or cIAP1/2ΔC-GFP molecules alone colocalized only marginally with the CD40 signaling complex after CD40 triggering. However, in the presence of cotransfected TRAF2, extensive colocalization of the cIAP1/2ΔC-GFP proteins and sCD40L was observed (Fig. 1D).

https://openalex.org/W2156388228,"Activation of classical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) like the mammalian gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR) typically stimulates heterotrimeric G protein molecules that subsequently activate downstream effectors. Receptor activation of heterotrimeric G protein pathways primarily controls intermediary cell metabolism by elevation or diminution of soluble cytoplasmic second messenger molecules. We have demonstrated here that stimulation of the GnRHR also results in a dramatic change in both cell adhesion and superstructural morphology. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor activation rapidly increases the capacity of HEK293 cells expressing the GnRHR to remain matrix-adherent in the face of fluid insults. Coinciding with this profound elevation in matrix adherence, we demonstrated a GnRH-induced alteration in both cell morphology and the <i>de novo</i> generation of polymerized actin structures. GnRH induction of cytoskeletal remodeling was correlated with significant increases in the tyrosine phosphorylation status of a series of cytoskeletal associated proteins, <i>e.g.</i> focal adhesion kinase (FAK), c-Src, and microtubule-associated protein kinase (MAPK or ERK1/2). The activation of the distal downstream effector ERK1/2 was demonstrated to be sensitive to the disrupters of cytoskeletal rearrangement, cytochalasin D and latrunculin B. In addition to the sensitivity of ERKs to cytoskeletal integrity, GnRH-induced FAK and c-Src kinase activation were sensitive to these agents and the fibronectin-integrin antagonistic RGDS peptide. Activation of ERK was dependent on its protein-protein assembly with FAK and c-Src at focal adhesion complexes. Induction of the cell remodeling event leading to this signaling complex assembly occurred primarily via GnRHR activation of the monomeric G protein Rac but not RhoA. These findings demonstrated a clear divergence of GnRHR signaling via the Rac monomeric G protein focal adhesion signaling complex assembly and cytoskeletal remodeling independent of the classical heterotrimeric G protein-controlled phospholipase C-β pathway."

Based on the extended UGT1 locus combined with Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization, we determined the distribution of UGT1A1 and UGT1A7 through UGT1A10 mRNAs and found them for the first time segmentally distributed in the mucosal epithelia layer of the gastrointestinal tract. Biochemically, recombinant isozymes exhibited pH optima of 5.5, 6.4, 7.6, 8.5, and/or a broad pH range, and activities were found to be unaffected or progressively inhibited by increasing substrate concentrations after attaining Vmax for certain chemicals. Under different optimal conditions, all exhibited wide substrate selections for dietary and environmentally associated chemicals. Evidence also suggests tandem effects of isozymes in the time for completion of reactions when comparing short- and long-term incubations. Moreover, treatment of colon cells with certain diet-associated constituents, curcumin and nordihydroguaiaretic acid, reversibly targets UGTs causing inhibition without affecting protein levels; there is no direct inhibition of control UGT using curcumin as substrate in the in vitro assay. In summary, we demonstrate that UGTs are located in gastrointestinal mucosa, have vast overlapping activities under differential optimal conditions, and exhibit marked sensitivity to certain dietary substrates/constituents, representing a first comprehensive study of critical properties concerning glucuronidating isozymes in alimentary tissues.

To this end, the human UGT1 complex locus, which encodes multiple UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isozymes distributed in the GI tract, participates in the broad and critical function of detoxifying lipid-soluble phenols derived metabolically or ingested as part of the diet, its contaminants, and as medications. UGT conjugates glucuronic acid to the acceptor substrate, converting the lipophile to an inactive glucuronide that undergoes facilitated excretion. The isozymes metabolize endogenous substrates such as bilirubin, steroids, bile acids, retinoic acid, and thyroid hormones. Equally important, isozymes also metabolize four categories of dietary phytochemicals that could pose risks for humans and animals when absorbed in excess. Highly abundant dietary flavonoids found in plants are shown to inhibit aromatase (1.Kellis J.T. Vickery L.E. Science. 1984; 225: 1032-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and less abundant anthraquinones and two types of phytoestrogens (2.Kühnau J. World Rev. Nutr. Diet. 1976; 24: 117-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Brown J.P. Mutat. Res. 1980; 75: 243-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 4.Seawright A.A. Natural Toxins. 1995; 3: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) can also cause cellular damage. Particular anthraquinones were mutagenic when bioactivated (3.Brown J.P. Mutat. Res. 1980; 75: 243-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) and were carcinogens in long-term feeding experiments in mice (5.Uraguchi K. Saito M. Noguchi Y. Takahashi K. Enomoto M. Tatsuno T. Food Cosmet. Toxicol. 1972; 10: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Injurious effects of diets were demonstrated by extensive lesions in the reproductive system of herbivores that grazed on clovers containing high levels of phytoestrogens, which presumably competed with endogenous estrogens (4.Seawright A.A. Natural Toxins. 1995; 3: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In particular, it is well established that ubiquitous aromatic hydrocarbons derived from wood, petroleum, and tobacco are bioactivated to mutagens and carcinogens by endogenous cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes (6.Levin W. Wood A.W. Yagi H. Dansette P.M. Jerina D.M. Conney A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Our daily consumable products also contain sources of potential toxins (3.Brown J.P. Mutat. Res. 1980; 75: 243-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). On the contrary, glucuronidating enzymes can also have a disadvantageous effect; many therapeutic chemicals are cleared from the body prematurely by the UGT system. Hence, it is important to understand the complex, variable function of this locus and mechanisms controlling these critical isozymes. Because this cluster of UGTs, including the critical bilirubin-metabolizing UGT1A1, is found segmentally distributed in GI tissues with strategic location in outer mucosal epithelia, we carried out experiments to determine whether their properties allowed them to prevent chemical absorptions so as to minimize toxicity. Here we demonstrate that five UGT isozymes encoded at the UGT1 locus have a broad metabolic profile for dietary and environmental chemicals. We show that the isozymes use differential optimal conditions in their extensive overlapping substrate activities. Also, we found the diet-associated chemicals, curcumin and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), transiently inhibited UGT activities in cell culture. Evidence suggests the function of the GI isozymes and their potential for inhibition by ingested constituents could, predictably, affect absorption of ingested chemicals and therapeutic drugs. Materials—Chemicals used were from Sigma, Fluka (Milwaukee, WI), Aldrich, or Indofine Chemical Co. (Somerville, NJ). Benzo(a)pyrene phenols were obtained from the National Cancer Institute Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standard Repository (Kansas City, MO). 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay kit was from Sigma. Northern Hybridization Analysis—Northern analysis of mRNA was carried out with commercially supplied blots (Clontech (Palo Alto, CA) and Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA)) by prehybridizing and then hybridizing at 37 °C for 1 h using 32P-5′-labeled isozyme-specific oligo (107 cpm/ml) for UGT1A1, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, or UGT1A10. Each oligo was 5′-kinased using [γ-32P]ATP (5,000 Ci/mm). Blots were washed three to four times in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS and once in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 24 °C for 30 to 40 min. Oligos used were: UGT1A1 (5′-ctccgtctctgatgtacaacgaggcgtcaggtgctaggac-3′), UGT1A7 (5′-gagaaaatgcacttcgcaatggtgccgtcc-3′), UGT1A8 (5′-cagagaaacacataggggaatggggctgg-3′), UGT1A9 (5′-ccagatcctccagggtatatgaagttgaa-3′), and UGT1A10 (5′-tagacacacacataaaggaacggggct-3′). β-Actin cDNA was labeled using random primers with [α-32P]CTP (3,000 Ci/mm). In Situ Hybridization—In situ hybridization to mRNA was carried out with each unique 5′ region (from nucleotide 1 to 320) that contains from 10 to 26% differences between UGT1A7 through UGT1A10 cDNAs for sense or antisense riboprobe labeled with [α-35S]CTP (1500 Ci/mm). Riboprobes were alkali-hydrolyzed generating, on average, 100-200-nucleotide hybridizing fragments and washed under high stringency at 60 °C. Normal human tissues were obtained from adjoining surgical specimens and accident victims through the National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI), Philadelphia, PA, according to its Institutional Review Board. Each unique fragment contained in pZErO™-1 vector was hybridized 16 h using 2 × 106 cpm/μl by Molecular Histology (Gaithersburg, MD) (7.Fox C.H. Cottler-Fox M. Coico R.

Because the UGT1A7 through UGT1A10 genes represent a cluster with 82-92% identity and has, in particular, a nearly identical segment between 832 and 855 bp, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, and UGT1A10 cDNAs were synthesized by using a similar strategy in conjunction with the previously cloned UGT1A9 cDNA (9.Wooster R. Sutherland L. Ebner T. Clarke D.J. da Cruz e Silva O. Burchell B. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 465-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), because all UGT1-encoded isozymes share a common carboxyl end of 245 amino acids specified by 4 common exons (10.Gong Q-H. Cho J.W.

(The UGT1A9 cDNA, originally designated HLUG-P4, was also isolated in this laboratory, sequenced, and submitted to GenBank™, accession number AFO56188.) The 5′-end (-44 to 855 bp) of the UGT1A7, UGT1A8, and UGT1A10 cDNAs was amplified using pfu Turbo polymerase, appropriate primers (see below), and exon 1-containing subclones obtained during characterization of the UGT1 locus (10.Gong Q-H.

A master connecting a 356-bp fragment between 828 and 1183 bp, TAP10, which is identical to UGT1A7, was generated using UGT1A9 cDNA as template with sense primer P5S-828 and antisense primer PXAS6 located outside of the common BstEII site in each cDNA. The master TAP10 subclone template was used with specific primer sets described below to generate the individual 352-bp connecting fragments (see below). The appropriate exon 1 and connecting fragment were combined in equal amounts, which annealed in the region between 832 to 855 bp; fill-in reactions beyond this hybridized segment generated the -44 to 1183-bp unit that was subsequently amplified using sense primer P9S3 for UGT1A7 and UGT1A10 and UGT1A8-3 for UGT1A8 in conjunction with the common antisense primer, PXAS7. Each -44 to 1183-bp cDNA fragment was digested with XhoI and BstEII and ligated into a XhoI/BstEII-digested pSVL-UGT1A9 cDNA expression unit as a cassette. Each cDNA was sequenced to establish the veracity of the custom synthesized cDNA by comparing the unique 5′ end to its respective exon 1 and the common 3′ ends with that region of UGT1A1 (8.Ritter J.K.

Synthesis of the master overlapping and connecting TAP10 template used: sense, P5S-828 (5′-ctgtcatcagggaaagccagtgcctatggaatttgaagcctacattaatg-3′) and antisense primer, PXAS6 (5′-taaacaccatgggaacca-3′) located outside the common BstEII site. With master TAP10 as template, synthesis of the individual 352-bp connecting fragments used: sense P5S-832 (5′-catcagggaaagccagtgcc-3′) for UGT1A7 or sense primer P10S-833-855 (5′-atcagggaaagccattgcctatg-3′) for both UGT1A8 and UGT1A10; all used antisense PXAS6. After combining exon 1 and the connecting fragment that first filled-in before amplification started, primers were: sense P9S3 (5′-ccctcgagggagctgctggctcgggctg-3′) for both UGT1A7 and UGT1A10 or sense UGT1A8-3 for UGT1A8 and common antisense primer, PXAS7 (5′-tgggtgataaaggcacg-3′). Transfection of UGT-cDNA Expression Units into COS-1 Cells—COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4% fetal calf serum and transfected with pSVL-UGT1A1 and pSVL-UGT1A7 through pSVL-UGT1A10 using DEAE-dextran as described (8.Ritter J.K.

Data in Fig. 4A and Tables II,III,IV were normalized using scans (Adobe Photoshop software) of the Western blot containing 1A1 and 1A7 through 1A10 for quantitation (Fig. 4B). The blot was prepared as described, and UGT-specific proteins were revealed following exposure to anti-UGT and anti-IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate as described (11.Ciotti M. Basu N. Brangi M.

Owens I.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10119-10124Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, the common donor substrate, UDP-[14C]glucuronic acid (1.41 mm, 1.4 μCi/μmol), was used in all reactions with an unlabeled acceptor substrate. Latent UGT activity was fully expressed by pretreatment with 0.5 mg of CHAPS/mg of cellular protein (12.Ciotti M. Owens I.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10119-10124Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A constant 300 μg of homogenate protein of COS-1-transfected cells with empty or UGT-containing pSVL vector, LS180 cells, or tissue microsomes (13.Bock K.W. Bock-Hennig B.S. Münzel P.A.

Assays to determine pH profiles were carried out with 0.04 m sodium phosphate from 5.0 to 7.0 and 0.04 m triethanolamine from 7.0 to 10 for 2 h. Reactions for kinetic analyses, including microsomal activity, were incubated either 1 or 2 h at 37 °C. Initially, both representative rapidly and inefficiently glucuronidated chemicals were studied with recombinant isozymes in 2-h incubations at pH 6.4 and 7.6 at 37 °C. After increasing the sensitivity of detection by using 16-h incubations at 24 °C, we compared 40 test chemicals to establish the overall effectiveness of the isozymes. All products were resolved by thin layer chromatography (12.Ciotti M. Owens I.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10119-10124Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with product quantified as previously described (14.Ciotti M. Yeatman M.T. Sokol R.J. Owens I.S. J. Biol.

Analysis of Curcumin in Cell Culture Medium—The fate of curcumin during cell treatment was followed by high performance liquid chromatography with a Beckman ultra C-18 analytical column (15.Pan M.H.

Preparation of Microsomes—Tissue adjacent to that used for in situ analysis was snap-frozen and stored at -80 °C before homogenizing for microsomal preparations (13.Bock K.W. Bock-Hennig B.S.

Description of the UGT1 Locus and Northern Blot Analysis of UGT mRNAs—Recently, we fully characterized the human UGT1 complex locus (Fig. 1A) (10.Gong Q-H. Cho J.W. Huang T. Potter C. Gholami N. Basu N.K. Kubota S. Carvalho S. Pennington M.W. Owens I.S. Popescu N.C. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and sought here to study its function by establishing under similar conditions tissue-specific expression of mRNAs encoding the different UGT isozymes. Furthermore, we wanted to compare Northern blot analysis with earlier studies that used mRNA-based templates in reverse transcriptase-PCR for DNA amplification (16.Strassburg C.P. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8719-8726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 17.Mojarrabi B. Mackenzie P.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biophys. 1998; 356: 301-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We found that the subset, UGT1A1 and UGT1A7 through UGT1A10, represented the major isozymes distributed in GI tissues; other UGT isozymes were not or barely detectable by Northern blot analysis. In addition to its well known expression in liver, UGT1A1 appeared at moderate to high levels in different regions of the small intestines and rectum (Fig. 1B, top panel), but it was not detectable in a full small intestinal sample (Fig. 1B, third panel). UGT1A1 was also detected at low levels in thyroid, spinal cord, trachea, and uterus and barely detectable in esophagus. Whereas UGT1A7 was nearly ubiquitously expressed in all tissues at low levels, it was far more abundant in 1 of 2 stomach specimens, the adrenal gland, and highest in thyroid tissue. Notably, it was moderately high in the intact small intestine that had no detectable UGT1Al (Fig. 1, third panels), which is consistent with its nearly ubiquitous presence in all tissues. Importantly, UGT1A7 and UGT1A1 are predicted to be present at high levels in esophagus when results are corrected for the low mRNA levels on the blot by using the internal β-actin probe (Fig. 1B). Results also show that UGT1A9 and UGT1A10, like UGT1A7, were expressed from the stomach or small intestine throughout the GI tract (Fig. 1B); UGT1A9 appeared to be high in the lower GI tissues, i.e. jejunum, ileum, colon, and rectum; the analysis showed the highest amount in kidney and significant levels in liver. In addition UGT1A10 is present in lung, heart, placenta, pancreas, spleen, leukocyte, spinal cord, lymph node, adrenal gland, bone marrow, ovary, and uterus at significant levels. Although Northern blot analysis suggested that UGT1A8 is present only in stomach with barely detectable levels in the small and large intestines (Fig. 1B), we found the mRNA was distributed erratically in high density in all GI tissues (Fig. 2A), especially in the fundus region of the stomach. Whereas UGT1A1 and UGT1A7 through UGT1A10 were differentially expressed in GI tissues with selective dominant locations for some, it is significant that UGT1A7 was present at trace to low levels in nearly every tissue.Fig. 2Cellular localization of mRNAs encoding UGT1A1 and UGT1A7 through UGT1A10. In situ hybridization was carried out with (A) antisense and (B) sense probes. The esophageal image was magnified 50 times for 1A7 and 200 times for 1A8; all others were magnified 100 times. Numbers below each panel represent glucuronidation by microsomes isolated from adjacent tissue in a 2-h incubation at 37 °C (pmol/h/g tissue) for comparison to the relative levels of mRNA. Substrates were bilirubin, thymol, phloretin, apigenin, and epigallocatechin 3-0-gallate for UGT1A1 (pH 6.4), UGT1A7 (pH 7.6), UGT1A8 (pH 7.0), UGT1A9 (pH 6.4), and UGT1A10 (pH 6.4), respectively, which are 80-100% specific, except that phloretin and apigenin were 33 and 42% specific for UGT1A8 and UGT1A9, respectively. The rationale for substrate selection is described in the legend to Table III. Assays for each specimen were carried out three times in triplicates; a total of 2 esophagi, 3 stomachs, 3 duodena, 2 ilea, and 4 colons were analyzed for in situ and activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cellular Localization of UGT mRNAs—Because we have chosen to focus our study on the GI tract, we analyzed the cellular location in these tissues. If the isozymes were to play important roles to minimize absorption of ingested chemicals their location in specific regions of the GI tract would be crucial. For detection of specific mRNA by using isozyme-specific antisense probes (Fig. 2A) compared with negative controls with sense probes (Fig. 2B), we found that isozymes were strategically located only in the outermost epithelia layers of GI tissues in a segmented pattern. For example, UGT1A7 showed highest expression in mucous-secreting squamous esophageal cells. Although UGT1A8 was located throughout the GI, it was at the highest level in the mucous-secreting cells of the stomach fundus (Fig. 2A, top panel). We also discovered by in situ analysis that this mRNA is also erratically concentrated in a highly segmented pattern throughout other GI tissues (Fig. 2A). Despite the areas of concentrated distribution, UGT1A8 was overall at much lower levels in small and large intestines compared with UGT1A9 and UGT1A10. Such distribution was not evident by Northern blot analysis, most likely, because of mRNA dilution in the enriched mucosal segments by the large bulk of the lower tissue layers. UGT1A1, UGT1A9, and UGT1A10 were highest in duodenal enterocytes with progressively less in mucosal layers of ileum and mucous-secreting goblet cells of colon. Tissue-specific microsomal activities below each panel (Fig. 2A) were generally consistent with relative levels of mRNA using the most specific substrate and pH conditions possible for each isozyme as described in the legend of Table III. Effects of pH, Time, and Substrate Concentration on UGT Activity—Because an indeterminate number of chemicals are ingested daily in dietary plants, we screened many agents from that source to identify specific glucuronidations and substrate characteristics. Phloretin (4,2′,4′,6′-tetra-hydroxychalcone), a precursor of plant-derived flavonoids, and eugenol were found to be model substrates to establish conditions to study 40 diet-associated chemicals (2.Kühnau J. World Rev. Nutr. Diet. 1976; 24: 117-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Brown J.P. Mutat. Res. 1980; 75: 243-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 4.Seawright A.A. Natural Toxins. 1995; 3: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Because intraluminal pH conditions vary greatly throughout the GI, we carried out experiments to determine pH dependence. Overall, UGT1A7 metabolized equally at pH 6.4 or 7.6, having a range from pH 6.0 to 8.5; UGT1A10 metabolized preferentially at pH 6.4 as demonstrated by eugenol (Fig. 3A) with a summary of pH profiles presented below. Whereas UGT1A1 was shown to be active predominantly at pH 6.4 (12.Ciotti M. Owens I.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10119-10124Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we found UGT1A8 and UGT1A9 have pH optimum of 7.0 and 7.6, respectively. 2N. K. Basu and I. S. Owens, unpublished data. Hence, results show the UGT isozymes have differential pH optima. To compare the relative effectiveness of UGT1A7 and UGT1A10 in the metabolism of a broad range of chemicals, we first established conditions for linear rates of glucuronidation for model xenobiotics at 37 °C as shown in Fig. 3B. Rates are shown to be linear for at least 2 h for UGT1A1 with eugenol and anthraflavic acid and for both UGT1A7 and UGT1A10 with eugenol and phloretin (Fig. 3B). Because our diet is highly variable for both chemical composition and time lapses of ingestion, absorption gradients of substrates for various UGTs may vary greatly in different GI segments. Thus, we sought to determine whether UGT activity is substrate-concentration dependent. We observed, for example, that UGT1A7 or UGT1A10 activity increased as substrate increased reaching saturation kinetics between 100 and 200 μm eugenol and phloretin (Fig. 3C). Beyond 200 μm, UGT1A10 was progressively inhibited culminating at 100% in accordance with typical substrate-inhibition profiles (19.Naught L.E. Tipton P.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 396: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas UGT1A7 lost only ∼15% activity with a sustained plateau (Fig. 3C). Sensitivity to high substrate concentrations by UGT1A10 and resistance by UGT1A7 were observed at both pH 6.4 with phosphate buffer and pH 8.5 with triethanolamine buffer (Fig. 3C). Similarly, UGT1A8 appeared resistant to high-substrate inhibition during examination with phloretin, eugenol, and emodin, whereas UGT1A9 activity increased with increasing anthraflavic acid concentrations, but was inhibited above 60 μm (data not shown). The resistance to inhibition at elevated substrate concentrations by UGT1A7 and UGT1A8, at least, can act to extend conditions for glucuronidation of certain chemicals. As we used model chemicals for catalytic optimizations, we determined the Km and Vmax values for anthraflavic acid, chrysin, eugenol, phloretin, and curcumin with one or more isozymes. The results show Km values from 3.3 to 100 μm for the isozymes studied (Table I). UGT1A10 exhibited the lowest Km, 3.3 μm for phloretin. Also, UGT1A1 metabolized chrysin with 4 μm Km, which is comparable with its metabolism of endogenous bilirubin with 2.5 μm Km (20.Ritter J.K. Yeatman M.T. Kaiser C. Gridelli B. Owens I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23573-23579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas UGT1A7 and UGT1A10 had nearly comparable Km values for eugenol and phloretin, all Km values for 1A10, which revealed susceptibility to inhibition by high levels of certain chemicals (Fig. 3C), were below 50 μm. For these test chemicals, the isozymes appeared to exhibit differential substrate affinities consistent with continuous glucuronidation via the collective action of the isozymes, starting with low chemical levels. As predicted, the isozymes displayed a wide range in Vmax values from 800 to 16,600 pmol/mg of protein/h for curcumin (1A8) and anthraflavic acid (1A1), respectively.Table IKm and Vmax values for UGT isozymesUGTsAnthraflavic acidChrysinEugenolPhloretinCurcuminpHKmVmaxaVmax' pmol/mg protein/h.pHKmVmaxpHKmVmaxpHKmVmaxpHKmVmaxμmμmμmμmμm1A16.41016.6×1036.45.08.3×1036.41001.8×1037.6108.3×1037.64.05.5×1031A76.415.98.3×1036.496.45.8×1037.61002.1×1038.525.718.3×1031A87.06.86.6×1037.01008.0×1021A97.6105.5×1031A106.424.56.1×1036.4453.3×1036.41007.0×1037.68.44.3×103a Vmax' pmol/mg protein/h.

https://openalex.org/W2046726891,"Acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) and acetolactate synthase (ALS) are thiamine diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent enzymes that catalyze the decarboxylation of pyruvate to give a cofactor-bound hydroxyethyl group, which is transferred to a second molecule of pyruvate to give 2-acetolactate. AHAS is found in plants, fungi, and bacteria, is involved in the biosynthesis of the branched-chain amino acids, and contains non-catalytic FAD. ALS is found only in some bacteria, is a catabolic enzyme required for the butanediol fermentation, and does not contain FAD. Here we report the 2.3-Å crystal structure of Klebsiella pneumoniae ALS. The overall structure is similar to AHAS except for a groove that accommodates FAD in AHAS, which is filled with amino acid side chains in ALS. The ThDP cofactor has an unusual conformation that is unprecedented among the 26 known three-dimensional structures of nine ThDP-dependent enzymes, including AHAS. This conformation suggests a novel mechanism for ALS. A second structure, at 2.0 Å, is described in which the enzyme is trapped halfway through the catalytic cycle so that it contains the hydroxyethyl intermediate bound to ThDP. The cofactor has a tricyclic structure that has not been observed previously in any ThDP-dependent enzyme, although similar structures are well known for free thiamine. This structure is consistent with our proposed mechanism and probably results from an intramolecular proton transfer within a tricyclic carbanion that is the true reaction intermediate. Modeling of the second molecule of pyruvate into the active site of the enzyme with the bound intermediate is consistent with the stereochemistry and specificity of ALS.

The enzyme EC 2.2.1.6 (formerly EC 4.1.3.18) known both as acetolactate synthase (ALS) 1The abbreviations used are: ALS, acetolactate synthase; AHAS, acetohydroxyacid synthase; DTT, dithiothreitol; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; ThDP, thiamine diphosphate. and as acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) catalyzes the conversion of 2 mol of pyruvate to acetolactate plus CO2 (1.Duggleby R.G. Pang S.S. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 33: 1-36Google Scholar). These two different names for the enzyme distinguish two forms (2.Gollop N. Damri B. Barak Z. Chipman D.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6310-6317Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) that have distinctly different properties. One difference is that AHAS requires FAD, whereas ALS is FAD-independent. However, ALS and AHAS are clearly related proteins with substantial sequence similarities and share a requirement for thiamine diphosphate (ThDP). In most flavin-containing enzymes that catalyze non-redox reactions (3.Bornemann S. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), the cofactor has been shown, or is suspected, to play an internal role as an electron acceptor/donor. For example, in chorismate synthase, flavin mononucleotide participates in free radical chemistry (4.Osborne A. Thorneley R.N.F. Abell C. Bornemann S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35825-35830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The exception is hydroxynitrile lyase, where there appears to be no internal redox role (5.Vargo D. Pokora A. Wang S.W. Jorns M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 6027-6033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a curious parallel to ALS/AHAS, this enzyme exists in two forms, only one of which contains FAD (6.Wajant H. Effenberger F. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1996; 377: 611-617PubMed Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the FAD-dependent almond hydroxynitrile lyase (7.Dreveny I. Gruber K. Glieder A. Thompson A. Kratky C. Structure. 2001; 9: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) suggests that the cofactor is an evolutionary remnant of an aryl alcohol oxidase progenitor. Similarly, AHAS may have evolved from a pyruvate oxidase ancestor (8.Chang Y.-Y. Cronan Jr, J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3937-3945Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Our determination of the structure of the FAD-dependent yeast AHAS (9.Pang S.S. Duggleby R.G. Guddat L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) supports this idea; FAD is located close to the active site and in a position similar to that in pyruvate oxidase. The function of FAD in AHAS appears to be solely for maintenance of structural integrity. An alternative approach to unraveling the role of FAD in AHAS is to understand how the FAD-independent ALS can dispense with this cofactor. This enzyme, from Aerobacter aerogenes, was crystallized in 1967 (10.Störmer F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1756-1759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but no x-ray diffraction studies were reported. We obtained diffraction-quality crystals of the enzyme from the closely related bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.Pang S.S. Guddat L.W. Duggleby R.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1237-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar); now we report the three-dimensional structure of this ALS. ThDP-dependent enzymes are ubiquitous in nature and are involved in all major metabolic processes. It is generally accepted that the initial step in catalysis by these enzymes is the deprotonation of the thiazolium ring at the C-2 atom (Fig. 1, A, I → II, and B).

Chem. 1967; 242: 1756-1759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) corresponds to a kcat of 533 s-1 which is about 10-fold higher than that of any FAD-dependent AHAS (e.g. Ref. 25.Hill C.M.

Quite the reverse; the FAD-dependent enzyme is unable to achieve rate enhancements that are attainable by ALS. The kcat value of K. pneumoniae ALS is significantly higher than that of any ThDP-dependent enzyme with a known structure. The kcat value is also substantially higher than the observed rate constant for C-2 deprotonation in Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase and in yeast transketolase (26.Kern D. Kern G. Neef H. Tittmann K. Killenberg-Jabs M. Wikner C. Schneider G. Hübner G. Science. 1997; 275: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), suggesting that the environment of ThDP in K. pneumoniae ALS might be especially favorable for C-2 deprotonation. Here we report, at 2.3-Å resolution, the structure of the enzyme containing ThDP and the other essential cofactor Mg2+; henceforth, this complex will be denoted the “resting” enzyme. ThDP is bound in a conformation that is slightly, but significantly, different from that found in all other ThDP-dependent enzymes. We propose a mechanism for C-2 deprotonation that implies an active role for the sulfur atom of ThDP, similar to a suggestion by Kluger (27.Kluger R. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 863-876Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Only two of the reported structures of ThDP-dependent enzymes have intermediates attached to the cofactor. These are pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (28.Chabrière E. Vernede X. Guigliarelli B. Charon M.H. Hatchikian E.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Science. 2001; 294: 2559-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) containing the acetyl radical of ThDP (formed from pyruvate) and transketolase (29.Fiedler E. Thorell S. Sandalova T. Golbik R. König S. Schneider G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 591-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) with the α-carbanion or enamine of dihydroxyethyl-ThDP (formed from hydroxypyruvate). For both enzymes, trapping of the intermediate results because no acceptor substrate is present to complete the catalytic cycle. For 2-ketoacid decarboxylases such as pyruvate decarboxylase, there is no second substrate, so intermediate capture does not seem to be feasible. Superficially, the same is true for ALS/AHAS; although there is a second substrate, it cannot be omitted because it is chemically identical to the first substrate. However, we realized that the catalytic cycle of ALS/AHAS possesses an unusual feature that makes intermediate capture inevitable, as we shall show later. The second structure reported here, at both 2.0- and 2.3-Å resolution, is of K. pneumoniae ALS containing the intermediate formed after decarboxylation of the first pyruvate. The intermediate formed appears to be the hydroxyethyl derivative of the tricyclic form of ThDP. Expression and purification of K. pneumoniae ALS were as described previously (11.Pang S.S. Guddat L.W. Duggleby R.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1237-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Prior to crystallization, the enzyme was concentrated to 9 mg/ml in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm ThDP, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. Crystals of the enzyme grown in hanging drops (1 μl of reservoir solution and 1 μl of protein solution) and incubated at 17 °C appeared overnight and reached their maximum size in 2 weeks. The reservoir solution consisted of 0.1 m Na-Hepes (pH 7.5-7.7), 6-8% (w/v) PEG8000, and 6-9% (v/v) ethylene glycol. The crystals reported previously (11.Pang S.S. Guddat L.W. Duggleby R.G.

Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1237-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) belong to the space group C2, and diffract to 2.6-Å resolution, but in subsequent crystallization experiments using the same conditions, orthorhombic and triclinic crystals were obtained (Table I). Because the C2 crystals diffract to moderate resolution only, further structural studies were pursued with the new crystal forms. To trap the intermediate, orthorhombic and triclinic crystals were soaked in 200 mm pyruvate (Km = 34.1 ± 3.9 mm) for 1 week. For cryoprotection, crystals were transferred to 5 μl of reservoir solution containing 30% (v/v) PEG600.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsRestingIntermediate OaEnzyme-intermediate complex, formed by soaking orthorhombic (O) or triclinic (T) crystals with 200 mm pyruvate.Intermediate TaEnzyme-intermediate complex, formed by soaking orthorhombic (O) or triclinic (T) crystals with 200 mm pyruvate.Crystal dataUnit cell length (Å)a = 116.8a = 117.5a = 86.3b = 160.6b = 160.6b = 92.8c = 129.4c = 129.5c = 97.4Unit cell angle (°)α = 90.0α = 90.0α = 68.0β = 90.0β = 90.0β = 63.5γ = 90.0γ = 90.0γ = 67.7Space groupC2221C2221P1Crystal dimensions (mm)0.2 × 0.05 × 0.050.2 × 0.05 × 0.050.3 × 0.3 × 0.05Diffraction databValues in parentheses are statistics for the highest resolution shell, 2.38 to 2.30 Å for the orthorhombic crystals and 2.07 to 2.00 Å for the triclinic crystal.Temperature (K)100100100Resolution range (Å)100-2.3100-2.3100-2.0Observations [I>0σ(I)]195,326 (4677)170,273 (5047)285040 (17,104)Unique reflections [I>0σ(I)]48,069 (2370)48,466 (3030)153,254 (11,633)Completeness87.5 (43.7)88.2 (49.3)93.8 (71.3)RsymcRsym=∑|I-〈I〉|/∑〈I〉, where I is the intensity of an individual measurement of each reflection and 〈I〉 is the mean intensity of that reflection.0.055 (0.113)0.057 (0.126)0.030 (0.14)〈I〉/〈σ(I)〉21.5 (5.6)17.7 (4.5)29.2 (4.6)RefinementResolution limits (Å)100-2.3100-2.3100-2.0Monomers per asymmetric unit224No. atoms per asymmetric unitdValues in parentheses are average B-factors, in Å2.Protein non-H8204 (24.4)8256 (25.6)16,260 (33.1)ThDP non-H2 × 26 (21.1)ThDP/intermediate non-H2 × 29 (18.7)4 × 29 (22.9)Mg22 (13.9)2 (12.8)4 (24.2)Phosphate non-H2 × 5 (16.4)2 × 5 (19.8)4 × 5 (40.6)Diethylene glycol non-H9 × 7 (45.0)8 × 7 (50.0)5 × 7 (52.9)Triethylene glycol non-H2 × 10 (48.9)Water molecules527 (34.1)612 (36.3)1335 (42.3)Rfactor0.1650.1620.191Rfree0.2150.2140.228Root mean square deviationsBond lengths (Å)0.0050.0050.005Bond angles (°)1.241.231.26Ramachandran plot (%)Most favored91.190.690.6Additionally allowed8.89.49.3Generously allowed0.10.00.1Disallowed0.00.00.0a Enzyme-intermediate complex, formed by soaking orthorhombic (O) or triclinic (T) crystals with 200 mm pyruvate.b Values in parentheses are statistics for the highest resolution shell, 2.38 to 2.30 Å for the orthorhombic crystals and 2.07 to 2.00 Å for the triclinic crystal.c Rsym=∑|I-〈I〉|/∑〈I〉, where I is the intensity of an individual measurement of each reflection and 〈I〉 is the mean intensity of that reflection.d Values in parentheses are average B-factors, in Å2. Open table in a new tab For this study, three complete data sets were collected; one of the resting enzyme (i.e. without added pyruvate) and two of the enzyme-intermediate complex formed by soaking with pyruvate. An orthorhombic crystal was used to collect data on the resting enzyme, and data from an orthorhombic and a triclinic crystal were collected for the enzyme-intermediate complex. The three data sets were collected on Beam-Line 14D at the Advanced Photon Source in the Argonne National Laboratory, Chicago. The data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (30.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The structures of the enzyme-intermediate complex, in the orthorhombic and triclinic crystals, were solved concurrently using AMoRe (31.Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar). The search molecule for both forms was a dimer of the core region (residues 94-256, 289-383, 403-438, and 491-646) of the catalytic subunit of yeast AHAS (PDB code 1JSC, see Ref. 9.Pang S.S. Duggleby R.G. Guddat L.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 317: 249-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). By using the AHAS dimer as the probe, two peaks in the rotation function were observed, both of which had correlation coefficients of 0.257. This compared with a correlation coefficient of 0.067 for the next highest peak. The translation function positioning the second dimer relative to the first was next calculated. The highest peak resulted in assembly of the expected tetramer. The correlation coefficient for this solution was 0.448. Rigid body refinement of the model, using data from 15 to 4 Å, gave an Rfactor of 0.424. For the orthorhombic crystal, a dimer in the asymmetric unit was observed in the rotation and translation function calculations. The solution had a correlation coefficient of 0.290 and an Rfactor of 0.550. Rigid body refinement of the model, using data from 15 to 4 Å, gave a correlation coefficient of 0.560 and an Rfactor of 0.437. The structure of the resting enzyme was determined using the coordinates of the orthorhombic enzyme-intermediate complex as a starting point. Model building and refinement of the three structures were carried out using the program O (32.Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Overall Structure of the Resting Enzyme—K. pneumoniae ALS is composed of 559-residue subunits (38.Peng H.-L. Wang P.-Y. Wu C.-M. Hwang D.-C. Chang H.-Y. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 117: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), thought to be arranged as a homotetramer as in its A. aerogenes counterpart (39.Huseby N.-E. Christensen T.B. Olsen B.R. Størmer F.C. Eur. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1971; 20: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The recombinant ALS that we have crystallized possesses a native N-terminal sequence but has seven additional C-terminal residues, glutamate followed by a hexahistidine sequence. The asymmetric unit in the resting enzyme consists of a dimer, with the other half of the tetramer related by a crystallographic 2-fold axis of symmetry (Fig. 2A). Electron density for one subunit (arbitrarily designated monomer A) extends from Val7-His554, except that there is a three-residue gap from Ser184-Ala186 in a linker between two domains. No side-chain electron density beyond the β-carbon atom was visible for three polar surface residues Gln188, Lys208, and Lys225. Electron density for monomer B extends by two additional residues at the N terminus but has three gaps: at Val118-Gln120 (surface loop), at Ser184-Ala186 (domain linker), and at Arg362-Gly363 (domain boundary). In monomer B, no side-chain electron density beyond the β-carbon atom was visible for seven polar surface residues Gln117, Gln188, Arg228, Glu289, Arg312, Arg350, and Arg361. Each monomer is composed of three distinct domains (Fig. 2B), designated from the N terminus as the α-, β-, and γ-domains. The α-domain extends from the observable N terminus to Ala183; the β-domain spans residues Pro193-Ser342, and the γ-domain commences at Asp360 and extends to the observable C terminus. The connector between the α- and β-domains is a 9-residue random coil, partly undefined in both monomers. The connector between the β- and γ-domains is a well defined 17-residue α-helix, Pro343-Leu359 (Fig. 3, α13). The α- and γ-domains are each built around a six-stranded parallel β-sheet with the same Richardson topology of +1x, -2x, -1x, -2x, +1x, surrounded by α-helices. The α-domain has an additional short anti-parallel β-sheet (Fig. 3, β1/β8) derived from the N- and C-terminal sections of the domain. The β-domain has a six-stranded parallel β-sheet with a Richardson topology of +1x, +1x, -3x, -1x, -1x. This β-sheet forms part of a double Rossmann fold. The two monomers are very similar and when overlaid yield a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.68 Å for 536 equivalent Cα atoms. The most prominent difference is in a small loop that precedes the Val118-Gln120 gap in monomer B. The remaining differences are in the β-domain, which is shifted slightly relative to the remainder of the protein. All ThDP-dependent enzymes have this cofactor bound at the active site in a domain interface, and in most cases the domains are derived from different subunits. The same is true of ALS; however, the crystallographic subunit pair does not correspond to the pair that forms the active site (Fig. 2A). Two identical active sites are formed at the interface between monomer A and its symmetry partner. Similarly, monomer B and its symmetry partner form a second pair of identical active sites. Thus, the two functional dimers are each symmetrical but slightly different from one another. These differences most likely originate from crystal packing forces. Comparison with the FAD-dependent AHAS—The primary and secondary structures of ALS are very similar to those of the FAD-dependent AHAS (Fig. 3). The three-dimensional structures are also very similar. When the α-domains are overlaid (r.m.s.d. = 1.23 Å for 168 Cα atoms), the only noticeable difference is in a loop comprising residues Ala112-Asp123, which adopts a different conformation in the two proteins. This region in ALS is located at the dimer-dimer interface of the tetramer. Yeast AHAS, on the other hand, does not form a homotetramer and exists as a dimer in both solution and crystals. The γ-domains are also very similar between ALS and AHAS (r.m.s.d. = 1.44 Å for 166 Cα atoms). However, AHAS has a C-terminal extension as described previously (40.Pang S.S. Guddat L.W. Duggleby R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7639-7644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) that is not found in ALS (Fig. 3). The β-domains of the two proteins are the most different of the three domains, with a higher r.m.s.d. value (1.49 Å) for fewer (133) Cα atoms. In general, this domain in both enzymes has a similar secondary structure topology, consisting of a central six-stranded parallel β-sheet surrounded by helices and loops. The major differences are in the connections between the strands of the central β-sheet. An example is the polypeptide segment connecting the β-strands 12 and 13 (Fig. 3). In yeast AHAS this segment, comprising residues Gly374 to Gly401, consists of two helices that are separated by a random coil. The corresponding region in ALS (Gly282-Ala298) is 11 residues shorter and has two short helices, but neither corresponds to those found in AHAS. The most obvious difference between the structures of ALS and AHAS is that the latter contains FAD. In AHAS, the FAD-binding site is located mainly in the β-domain. FAD binds near the C-terminal edge of the central parallel β-sheet and forms multiple interactions with a series of loop regions found on the surface of the domain. Most of the interacting amino acid residues are highly conserved among AHAS sequences across plant and fungal and bacterial species. The surface topology of the binding site shows clearly that FAD, in an extended conformation, lies in a groove that runs across the β-domain (Fig. 2D). This groove structure is missing from the surface topology of the corresponding area in the β-domain of ALS (Fig. 2C). The absence of the groove structure in ALS is brought about by slightly different orientations of the surface loop regions, and by amino acid substitutions to bulky hydrophobic residues at positions that interact with FAD in AHAS. Structure of ThDP in the Resting Enzyme—ThDP is bound at a subunit interface, anchored at one end through a magnesium ion that is octahedrally coordinated to six oxygen atoms: one from each phosphate group, one from the side chains of Asp447 and of Asp474, the backbone of Gly476, and one water molecule. The arrangement of ligands is slightly unusual compared with other ThDP-dependent enzymes in that the amino acid side-chain ligands are usually an aspartate and an asparagine, which are found at the two ends of the “thiamine-binding motif” discovered by Hawkins et al. (41.Hawkins C.F. Borges A. Perham R.N. FEBS Lett. 1989; 255: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The asparagine is highly conserved (42.Candy J.M. Duggleby R.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1385: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with the possible exception of ALS sequences. In Z. mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase, mutation of the equivalent asparagine to aspartate results in a drastic reduction in the affinity for ThDP (43.Candy J.M. Duggleby R.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The reason that ALS uses aspartate rather than asparagine as a magnesium ion ligand is therefore not clear. What is clear is that the presence of both ThDP and magnesium ion lays to rest the suggestion (38.Peng H.-L. Wang P.-Y. Wu C.-M. Hwang D.-C. Chang H.-Y. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 117: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that K. pneumoniae ALS does not require these cofactors. The first step in catalysis by ThDP-dependent enzymes is widely believed to be the ionization of the thiazolium ring of ThDP (Fig. 1A, I → II). In both ThDP (Fig. 1B) and the resulting C-2 carbanions, the thiazolium ring is expected to be planar with its aromaticity producing C-2—N-3 and C-4—C-5 bonds with lengths approaching those of double bonds. This expectation is confirmed in the structures of all ThDP-dependent enzymes containing unmodified ThDP. The bond from N-3 to C-7′, which connects to the methylaminopyrimidine ring, is normally in the same plane as the thiazolium ring due to sp2 hybridization at N-3. This geometry is observed in the structures of all ThDP-dependent enzymes containing unmodified ThDP. In K. pneumoniae ALS the thiazolium ring is planar, but the angle between the electron density associated with the thiazolium and methylaminopyrimidine rings is more acute than that in any of the 26 known three-dimensional structures of nine ThDP-dependent enzymes. In order to fit the two rings into the observed electron density while maintaining planarity at N-3 (Fig. 4A), it is necessary to propose a bond angle of 96° at C-7′ and of 90° at the methylene that links to the diphosphate tail of the cofactor. These unfavorable angles are each about 15° more acute than those observed in other ThDP-dependent enzymes, which average 111° (range 107-115°) and 107° (range 103-112°), respectively. An alternative explanation is that the structure is pyramidal at N-3 (Fig. 4A), resulting in acceptable bond angles of 110° and 104°, respectively. At 2.3-Å resolution the electron density is not sufficiently well resolved to discriminate between the two possibilities. However, our preferred model is that with a pyramidal N-3 because there is a reasonable mechanism that could give rise to this structure. A pyramidal N-3 could arise from an improbable reduction by DTT to the thiazoline (44.Zoltewicz J.A. Dill C.D. Abboud K.A. J. Org. Chem. 1997; 62: 6760-6766Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar) or by charge migration from N-3 to S-1 (Fig. 5, Ia). Kluger (27.Kluger R. Chem. Rev. 1987; 87: 863-876Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar) noted the importance of Ia to the probable structure of the carbanion. Although this S+ form is expected to be less favored than the"

To investigate the mechanisms underlying enzyme replacement therapy for this disorder, we studied the uptake of recombinant, human ASM (rhASM) by alveolar macrophages from ASM knock-out (ASMKO) mice. The recombinant enzyme used for these studies was produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells and contained complex type, N-linked oligosaccharides. Binding of radiolabeled, rhASM to the ASMKO macrophages was enhanced as compared with normal macrophages, consistent with their larger size and increased surface area. However, internalization of the enzyme by the ASMKO cells was markedly reduced when compared with normal cells. Studies using receptor-specific ligands to inhibit enzyme uptake revealed that in normal cells rhASM was taken up by a combination of mannose and mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MR and M6PR, respectively), whereas in the ASMKO cells the M6PR had a minimal role in rhASM uptake. Expression of M6PR mRNA was normal in the ASMKO cells, although Western blotting revealed more receptors in these cells when compared with normal. We therefore hypothesized that lipid accumulation in ASMKO macrophages led to abnormalities in M6PR trafficking and/or degradation, resulting in reduced enzyme uptake. Consistent with this hypothesis, we also found that, when rhASM was modified to expose terminal mannose residues and target mannose receptors, the uptake of this modified enzyme form by ASMKO cells was ∼10-fold greater when compared with the “complex” type rhASM. These findings have important implications for NPD enzyme replacement therapy, particularly in the lung.

ASM is responsible for hydrolyzing the lipid, sphingomyelin, to ceramide and phosphocholine, and both forms of the disease are characterized by extensive lipid storage in various cells and tissues. Patients with Type A NPD follow a rapid, neurodegenerative course that leads to death by about 3 years of age, whereas Type B NPD patients have a less severe form of the disease with little or no neurological involvement. This latter form is characterized mainly by visceral organ complications, including hepatosplenomegaly and progressive pulmonary compromise (1.Schuchman E.H. Desnick R.J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L.

However, during the past decade the isolation of genes encoding most lysosomal enzymes and the development of expression systems that produced large quantities of recombinant proteins led to the successful treatment of several lysosomal storage diseases in animal models, providing “proof of principle” for this approach (e.g. Refs. 8.Ioannou Y.A.

In addition, enzyme therapy has become available for three human lysosomal storage diseases, Type 1 Gaucher disease, Fabry disease, and mucopolysaccharidosis type I (10.Barton N.W.

Med. 2001; 18: 182-188Crossref Scopus (589) Google Scholar), and clinical trials are underway for several other disorders (e.g. Refs. 13.van den Hout H. Reuser A. Vulto A.G. Loone M.C.

Dis. 2001; 24: 245-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Most lysosomal enzymes are glycoproteins containing N-linked oligosaccharides. The principle underlying enzyme replacement therapy for lysosomal storage disorders is that intravenous infusion of these enzymes will lead to cell-type specific uptake via receptors that recognize these carbohydrate structures. In particular, mannose 6-phosphate (M6P) and mannose residues present on these sugar chains are instrumental in determining selectivity and efficiency of uptake by specific cell types (15.Neufeld E.F. Birth Defects Orig. Artic. Ser. 1980; 16: 77-84PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Sly W.S. Kaplan A. Achord D.T. Brot F.E. Bell C.E. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1978; 23: 547-551PubMed Google Scholar). Macrophages are important therapeutic targets for many lysosomal storage diseases. These phagocytic cells have a complicated endocytosis mechanism involving several different receptors for internalization of specific lysosomal enzymes (17.Fuller M. Hopwood J.J. Anson D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1406: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 18.Sato Y. Beutler E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19.Diment S. Dean M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 762: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Among these receptors, the mannose and the M6P receptors are the best characterized, and their role in the uptake of lysosomal enzymes has been extensively investigated. A 175-kDa mannose receptor (MR) and the 275-kDa, cation-independent M6P receptor (also known as the M6P/IGF-II receptor, herein designated M6PR) are present on the cell surface and recycle constitutively from intracellular compartments (20.Stahl P.D. Schlesinger P.H. Sigardson E. Rodman J.S. Lee Y.C. Cell. 1980; 19: 207-215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 21.Braulke T. Gartung C. Hasilik A. Figura von K. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 1735-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The MR is a pattern recognition receptor for various microorganisms and has been shown to play an important role in host defense and scavenger function (22.Stahl P.D. Ezekowitz R.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), whereas the primary function of the M6PR appears to be the recapture of secreted lysosomal hydrolases and transport to the lysosomes. A 46-kDa, cation-dependent M6P receptor also has been identified in macrophages, but this receptor has not been shown to be present on the cell surface and has no endocytic function. A hallmark of NPD is the accumulation of large numbers of lipid-filled macrophages (“foam cells”) in various tissues, including the lung (23.Dhami R. Gordon R. He X. Schuchman E.H. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Previously, we treated a mouse model of NPD (i.e. acid sphingomyelinase knock-out mice; ASMKO) by enzyme replacement therapy using recombinant, human ASM (rhASM) containing “complex type,” N-linked oligosaccharides (24.Miranda S.R. He X. Simonaro C.M. Gatt S. Dagan A. Desnick R.J. Schuchman E.H. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1988-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25.He X. Miranda S.R. Xiong X. Dagan A. Gatt S. Schuchman E.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This treatment could prevent the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in visceral organs when the enzyme injections were begun early in life and also led to clearance of these macrophages from the tissues of older, affected mice. The goal of the current study was to investigate the mechanism(s) governing ASM uptake by NPD macrophages, with the hope that these mechanistic insights would lead to a better understanding of these successful preclinical studies, as well as improved and/or alternative therapeutic strategies. Our focus was on alveolar macrophages, because these are important therapeutic targets in NPD patients. In this study we report an unexpected and novel abnormality in macrophages from the ASMKO mice; i.e. reduced enzyme uptake via M6PRs. The implications of these findings for NPD enzyme replacement therapy are discussed within. Materials—RPMI 1640 medium and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were obtained from Cellgro (Herndon, VA). Mannose 6-phosphate and yeast mannan were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Purified recombinant human ASM (rhASM) and a modified form of rhASM with exposed mannose residues (modified rhASM) were provided by the Genzyme Corp. (Cambridge, MA). Mannosylated bovine serum albumin (mannoseBSA) was purchased from EY Labs (San Mateo, CA). Recombinant human IGF-II and IGF-I were purchased from Cell Sciences (Norwood, MA). Polyclonal, anti-rat M6P/IGF-II receptor rabbit antiserum was from Dr. Carolyn Scott (Kolling Institute of Medical Research, Australia). Polyclonal, anti-mouse MR rabbit antiserum was provided by Dr. Philip Stahl (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). All of the other reagents used were the highest quality available from commercial sources. Acid Sphingomyelinase Knock-out Mice—The ASMKO mouse colony was established from heterozygous (±) breeding pairs (26.Horinouchi K. Erlich S. Perl D.P. Ferlinz K. Bisgaier C.L. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. Stewart C.L. Schuchman E.H. Nat. Gen. 1995; 10: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Mice were housed in a pathogen-free facility according to IACUC guidelines, and routine histological evaluation of mouse lungs showed no evidence of infection. Normal (+/+) mice were littermates of homozygous (-/-) ASMKO mice. Genotypes of the mice were identified as previously described (26.Horinouchi K. Erlich S. Perl D.P. Ferlinz K. Bisgaier C.L. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. Stewart C.L. Schuchman E.H. Nat. Gen. 1995; 10: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Bronchoalveolar Lavage and Macrophage Cell Culture—Alveolar macrophages were obtained from 16- to 24-week-old ASMKO mice and age-matched normal littermates by bronchoalveolar lavage. Mice were sacrificed by halothane overdose, and the lungs were removed from the chest cavity en bloc, with the trachea intact. An 18-gauge catheter was inserted and tied into the trachea, and the lungs were washed 8-10 times by gentle massaging with 0.8 ml of cold normal PBS to obtain the maximum number of cells from the lungs. The lavage fluid was collected in plastic tubes and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of cold PBS and used for total cell counts with a Neubauer hemacytometer. For cell culture, alveolar cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage were washed once with sterile PBS, and 5 × 105 cells were then added to individual wells of 24-well tissue culture plates and grown in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum. Non-adherent cells were removed after 3 h by washing twice with warm PBS. Fresh medium was then added, and the adherent cells (macrophages) were grown overnight prior to the enzyme binding/uptake experiments. Binding and Uptake of 125I-Labeled Ligands—Purified rhASM, mannoseBSA, and IGF-II were radiolabeled by an iodination procedure using IODO-GEN (Pierce Biochemicals, Rockford, IL). 100 μg of protein was incubated with 0.5 mCi of 125I-Na (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 min in an IODO-GEN pre-coated iodination tube (Pierce Biochemicals), and the labeled product was then retrieved by passing through an NAP 10 column (Amersham Biosciences). For the binding assays, cells were incubated for 4 h with radiolabeled ligand at 4 °C, washed 3× with PBS, and solubilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. In the case of [125I]IGF-II binding assays, excess unlabeled IGF-I was added to cell cultures to prevent binding of labeled IGF-II- to IGF-I-specific receptors. For uptake assays, cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C, washed 3× with PBS, and solubilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. Counts were determined with an ISODATA gamma counter (Polymedco, Inc.). ASM Activity Assays—A fluorescence-based, high performance liquid chromatographic method was used to measure ASM activity in macrophage lysates (27.He X. Chen F. Dagan A. Gatt S. Schuchman E.H. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 314: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, equal volumes of cell lysates (prepared by 3 cycles of freeze-thaw in 0.01 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.25% Triton X-100) and 0.2 m BODIPY®-labeled C12-sphingomyelin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) diluted in assay buffer (0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0, containing 0.1 mm ZnCl2, and 0.5% Triton X-100), were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of ethanol, and the hydrolytic product (BODIPY® C12-ceramide), was detected and quantified by chromatographic analysis using a reverse phase column (Aquasil C-18, Keystone Scientific Inc., St. Marys, PA). Uptake Studies Using Non-labeled rhASM—For uptake studies using non-radiolabeled enzyme, 1 μg of rhASM (specific activity = 5.4 × 104 pmol/mg/h) or modified rhASM (specific activity = 5.2 × 104 pmol/mg/h) was added to the culture medium, and macrophages were incubated at 37 °C. After 3 or 24 h, the medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with PBS and subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles in 200 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.25% Triton X-100. Protein concentrations were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay method, and ASM activities were determined as described above. Levels of endogenous (background) ASM activity also were determined in normal and ASMKO macrophages to which no enzyme was added. Inhibition Studies Using Receptor-specific Ligands—For the inhibitor studies, 2 mg/ml yeast mannan or 10 mm M6P were added to the macrophage culture media at the same time as rhASM or modified rhASM. After 24 h, cells were washed twice with PBS, and the ASM activities were determined in the cell lysates as described above. Results were compared between experiments with or without mannan or M6P in the culture media to determine the inhibitory effect of each compound on ASM uptake. Immunoblotting Experiments—To detect the mannose or M6P receptors by Western blotting, 15 μg of total protein from normal or ASMKO cell lysates (obtained by mixing cells with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS followed by three cycles of freezing and thawing) was added to an equal volume of native loading buffer (without boiling), and electrophoresed on a 4-20% pre-cast Tris-glycine gel (Invitrogen Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) using standard SDS running buffer (National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA). Transfer to a Hybond-ECL nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) was carried out at 4 °C for 100 min at 40 V with transfer buffer containing 0.1% SDS. Proteins were detected by overnight incubation at 4 °C with a 1:400 dilution of a polyclonal antibody against the rat M6PR (28.Scott C.D. Baxter R.C. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) or a 1:2000 dilution of a polyclonal anti-MR antibody (29.Blum J.S. Stahl P.D. Diaz R. Fiani M.L. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 213: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), followed by a 60-min incubation at room temperature with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) at a dilution of 1:2000. Blocking was done with 0.05% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk powder in PBS. 0.1% BSA was added during the primary antibody incubation. Autoradiograms were analyzed with Scion Image Beta (version 4.0), an image processing and analysis program. The density of bands in lanes loaded with equal concentrations of protein (as determined by colloidal blue staining) was calculated as the area under the individual peaks of a plotted histogram. Ratios of the values for ASMKO to normal bands on the same gel were calculated. RNA Expression Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from alveolar macrophages using the RNeasy Mini kit from Qiagen (Valencia, CA) and separated on a denaturing gel. RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Bio-Rad Zeta-Probe blotting membrane) using the standard capillary transfer method, prehybridized for 1 h with Quikhyb solution (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX), and hybridized overnight at 68 °C. The ∼5-kb MR transcript was identified by hybridization to a 32P-labeled, 650-bp probe amplified from murine cDNA using primers described in Lane et al. (30.Lane K.B. Egan B. Vick S. Abdolrasulnia R. Shepherd V.L. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1998; 64: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The ∼9-kb M6PR transcript was identified using a 686-bp probe amplified from the murine cDNA using primers derived from the murine CI-M6PR/IGFII receptor mRNA sequence as follows: sense, 5′-CATTTACACATGGGAAGCTG-3′, and antisense, 5′-GACCATTACAGAAGTCTGG-3′. Northern blots were quantified using Scion Image Version 4.0 as described above for immunoblot analysis (n = 3). Binding and Uptake of rhASM by Alveolar Macrophages—Concentration-dependent binding (4 °C) and uptake (37 °C) of 125I-labeled rhASM were studied using normal or ASMKO alveolar macrophages (Fig. 1). Although binding of [125I]rhASM was increased in ASMKO macrophages compared with normal macrophages (Fig. 1A), consistent with their larger size and increased surface area (23.Dhami R. Gordon R. He X. Schuchman E.H. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), uptake of the enzyme by the ASMKO cells was significantly decreased, particularly when higher concentrations were used (Fig. 1B). To confirm these observations, uptake of rhASM also was determined at 3 and 24 h by measuring ASM activity in cell lysates (Fig. 1C). As can be seen, normal macrophages readily internalized the enzyme, whereas incorporation by ASMKO macrophages was significantly less at both time points, consistent with the results obtained using 125I-labeled enzyme. To elucidate which receptors were important for uptake of rhASM by alveolar macrophages, cells were incubated with rhASM alone, or in the presence of excess mannan or M6P (Fig. 1D). Mannan and M6P can specifically bind to MRs and M6PRs, respectively, and act as competitive inhibitors of receptor-mediated uptake (31.Shepherd V.L. Freeze H.H. Miller A.L. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2257-2261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ASM activity in the cells was measured after 24 h. As can be seen in Fig. 1D, addition of mannan almost completely inhibited rhASM uptake by normal macrophages, whereas addition of M6P resulted in ∼60% inhibition. This indicated that rhASM was taken up by a combination of both receptors in normal cells, consistent with the fact that rhASM contains five N-linked oligosaccharides, some of which are of the “complex” type (25.He X. Miranda S.R. Xiong X. Dagan A. Gatt S. Schuchman E.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1432: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 32.Ferlinz K. Hurwitz R. Moczall H. Lansmann S. Schuchman E.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 2243: 511-517Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast, in ASMKO macrophage cultures mannan inhibited uptake of rhASM by ∼60%, but M6P did not affect rhASM uptake at all. These results suggested that M6PRs were either not present on the ASMKO cell surface or were not functional. In addition, there was reduced utilization of MRs in the ASMKO cells. Analysis of MRs in Normal and ASMKO Macrophages—MRs are abundant on the surface of macrophages and involved in the uptake of several lysosomal enzymes. Commercial availability of the MR-specific ligand, mannoseBSA (18.Sato Y. Beutler E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1909-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), allowed us to further investigate whether there was a difference in MR-mediated uptake between ASMKO and normal macrophages. As can be seen in Fig. 2, binding (panel A) and uptake (panel B) studies performed using 125I-mannoseBSA revealed only slight differences between normal and ASMKO macrophages. Northern blotting revealed a moderate reduction of MR transcripts in the ASMKO cells (panel C), consistent with previous reports of reduced MR gene expression in activated macrophages (33.Harris N. Super M. Rits M. Chang G. Ezekowitz R.A. Blood. 1992; 80: 2363-2373Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Schreiber S. Perkins S.L. Teitelbaum S.L. Chappel J. Stahl P.D. Blum J.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 4973-4981PubMed Google Scholar), and there was a corresponding reduction in MR polypeptide in the ASMKO cells, as revealed by Western blotting (panel D). Overall, however, the expression and function of the MR system in ASMKO cells appeared intact, leading us to conclude that the marked rhASM uptake defect in ASMKO macrophages (Fig. 1) was due to abnormalities in other receptor-mediated pathways. Analysis of M6PRs in Normal and ASMKO Macrophages—We next used [125I]IGF-II as a M6PR-specific ligand to determine whether there were any differences in cell surface expression of this receptor between normal and ASMKO macrophages. This study revealed that ASMKO macrophages bound ∼50% less [125I]IGF-II compared with their normal counterparts (3260 ± 553 cpm compared with 5721 ± 680 cpm, n = 4, p < 0.005), suggesting reduced cell surface expression of M6PRs. Northern blot analyses revealed no differences in M6PR RNA expression between normal and ASMKO macrophages (Fig. 3A), but Western blotting studies showed a dramatic increase in the total amount of M6PRs in the ASMKO macrophages compared with normal (Fig. 3B). Because our inhibition studies using M6P (Fig. 1) had indicated that the M6PR system did not participate in the uptake of rhASM by the ASMKO cells, and receptor-binding studies with [125I]IGF-II showed reduced binding to the ASMKO cell surface, it was surprising to observe more M6PRs in the mutant cells compared with normal. Thus, we hypothesized that these receptors were either not located in the proper cellular compartments and/or were not functional. Evaluation of Modified rhASM Uptake by Alveolar Macrophages—In an effort to test our prediction that the MR uptake system in ASMKO alveolar macrophages was functional whereas the M6PR system was not, uptake of a highly mannosylated form of rhASM was evaluated. This modified enzyme form was prepared by sequential deglycosylation of rhASM to expose surface mannose residues, a procedure identical to that used to prepare the mannose terminated form of β-glucocerebrosidase (i.e. Cerezyme) currently used to treat patients with Type 1 Gaucher disease (35.Murray G.J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 149: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 4A, by 24 h both normal and ASMKO macrophages internalized the modified rhASM effectively. Internalization by ASMKO macrophages was ∼5-fold less than normal macrophages, consistent with the Northern and Western blotting data demonstrating somewhat lower expression of MRs in ASMKO macrophages compared with normal cells (see Fig. 2). Importantly, however, when the uptake of modified rhASM was compared with non-modified rhASM (see Fig. 1C), uptake by the modified enzyme form was ∼10-fold greater using either normal or ASMKO cells. This was consistent with our hypothesis that the MR uptake system was functional in ASMKO cells, and demonstrated that the modification procedure had produced a rhASM form that was targeting these receptors. Inhibition studies using mannan and M6P further confirmed these findings by revealing almost complete inhibition of modified rhASM uptake by mannan, but not M6P (Fig. 4B). ASM-deficient NPD is considered an excellent candidate for enzyme replacement therapy, particularly in those patients without primary neurological involvement (1.Schuchman E.H. Desnick R.J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Valle D. Sly W.S. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 3589-3610Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that intravenous injection of “complex” type, rhASM obtained from Chinese hamster ovary cells into ASMKO mice reduced sphingomyelin storage and improved macrophage infiltration in various visceral organs, including the liver, spleen, heart, and, to a lesser degree, the lung (24.Miranda S.R. He X. Simonaro C.M. Gatt S. Dagan A. Desnick R.J. Schuchman E.H. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1988-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, the one or more mechanisms underlying this preclinical, therapeutic success are not certain, nor do we have a full understanding of how rhASM is taken up by important cellular targets of pathology in this disease, including macrophages. Previous data from our laboratory demonstrated that direct lung delivery of rhASM into NPD mice was no more efficient than systemic delivery in improving lung pathology, despite the fact that a much greater concentration of the enzyme was directly available to the lung macrophages by the former method. 2R. Dhami and E. H. Schuchman, unpublished results. This led us to propose that there may be a defect in the ability of NPD alveolar macrophages to endocytose exogenous enzyme, a hypothesis that formed the basis for the current study. Most lysosomal enzymes are internalized by cells via surface receptors that recognize N-linked oligosaccharides. Macrophages express a variety of such cell surface receptors used for endocytosis, including the M6PRs, MRs, asialoglycoprotein receptors, and various scavenger receptors (36.Ginsel L.A. Franse J.A.M. Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 1991; 15: 1167-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Depending on the carbohydrate moieties of an enzyme, all of these receptors, individually or more likely in combination, may be expected to contribute to enzyme uptake by macrophages. Among these, the M6PR and MR are the best characterized. Many cell types possess M6PRs, but MRs are restricted primarily to cells of the reticuloendothelial system. Our studies using radiolabeled ligands and receptor-specific inhibitors demonstrated that both of these receptors play a role in rhASM uptake by normal, alveolar macrophages. This is consistent with previous work showing that both receptors are involved in the uptake of β-glucuronidase by peritoneal macrophages (19.Diment S. Dean M.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 762: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, our studies also showed that in ASM-deficient macrophages uptake via the M6PR system was very defective and that there was a dramatic accumulation of M6PRs in these cells, despite normal gene expression. This suggested abnormal trafficking and/or reduced degradation of M6PRs in ASMKO cells. It was not within the scope of this study to determine the ultrastructural localization of the M6PRs in the alveolar macrophages, however, preliminary investigation by microscopic immunofluorescent analysis suggests that M6PRs in ASMKO macrophages may be distributed abnormally compared with normal macrophages. 2R. Dhami and E. H. Schuchman, unpublished results. Further studies are warranted to determine exactly where the accumulating M6PRs are within the ASMKO cells. It is also notable that, although there was normal or only moderately reduced binding of either 125I-labeled mannoseBSA or IGF-II to the ASMKO macrophages, the binding of [125I]rhASM to these same cells was markedly enhanced. The enhanced enzyme binding may be due to its interactions with other receptor types, because it has been previously suggested that, even in cells lacking MRs (e.g. skin fibroblasts), M6PRs are only partially responsible for ASM uptake and other receptors are involved (37.Kery V. Krepinsky J.J.F. Warren C.D. Capek P. Stahl P.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Perhaps the normally small influence of these other receptors (e.g. asialoglycoprotein receptor, etc.) becomes more important in the disease state but is still insufficient to restore normal enzyme uptake. The data presented in this manuscript also have provided new insights into the mechanism underlying our successful preclinical enzyme replacement therapy studies in ASMKO mice (24.Miranda S.R. He X. Simonaro C.M. Gatt S. Dagan A. Desnick R.J. Schuchman E.H. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1988-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We now know that the clearance of alveolar macrophages from the airways of the treated mice we observed in these studies was almost certainly not due to direct uptake of rhASM by these cells. Instead, previous analysis of the lung pathology in these animals had revealed that there was an overexpression of inflammatory cell chemoattractants by epithelial cells in the ASMKO lungs (23.Dhami R. Gordon R. He X. Schuchman E.H. Lab. Invest. 2001; 81: 987-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), presumably resulting in enhanced recruitment of macrophages. Therefore, we hypothesize that the intravenous delivery of rhASM most likely resulted in uptake by these epithelial cells (which appear normal even in older mice), rather than the macrophages themselves, leading to subsequent correction of the chemokine levels and a reduction in inflammatory cell recruitment. With regards to enzyme replacement therapy, our data also suggested that it may be possible to improve uptake by NPD alveolar macrophages with a highly mannosylated form of rhASM (similar to the commercially available form of β-glucocerebrosidase, Cerezyme, in use for Type 1 Gaucher disease), because the MR appeared to retain function in the ASMKO cells. We were able to test and confirm this hypothesis using such a modified enzyme form and indeed found that ASMKO macrophages were capable of taking up ∼10-fold more of this enzyme form when compared with the non-modified enzyme. Although this is an important observation that could be used to influence potential therapies for NPD, it does not necessarily follow that macrophage-targeted enzyme replacement therapy for NPD would result in greater clinical efficacy than treatment with “complex type,” rhASM. Although this is certainly true for Type 1 Gaucher disease, in the murine model of MPS VII (Sly disease; β-glucuronidase deficiency), treatment with phosphorylated β-glucuronidase resulted in better clinical efficacy than treatment with non-phosphorylated enzyme (38.Sands M.S. Vogler C.A. Ohlemiller K.K. Roberts M.S. Grubb J.H. Levy B. Sly W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43160-43165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Ultimately, each lysosomal disease will prove to be unique and require enzyme targeting to specific cell types, and although macrophages are important cellular targets for NPD, they are not the exclusive cellular sites of pathology. Because MRs are restricted to cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, enzyme therapy directed at this cell population alone might be counterproductive. In addition, we do not know how the results reported here with alveolar macrophages compare with other macrophage populations in NPD patients. Ultimately, successful treatment of NPD individuals by enzyme replacement therapy will require targeting to multiple cell types, and the ideal ASM preparation for enzyme replacement therapy may be one that includes enzyme with a variety of oligosaccharides designed to take advantage of the many cellular receptors involved in endocytosis. We thank Dr. Ken Karey of the Genzyme Corporation for providing the modified and non-modified rhASM and Dr. Xingxuan He for assistance with the ASM assays."

Here, we investigated the functional implications of c-Fos activation and its contribution to hepatocellular tumorigenesis. By employing conditional c-Fos expression, we observed that continuous activation of c-Fos and consequently AP-1 activity leads to depolarization of differentiated murine epithelial hepatocytes. Most remarkably, this change in morphology was associated with inhibition of proliferation and induction of cell death. Coexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-XL or scavenging of reactive oxygen species was sufficient to prevent the c-Fos-mediated phenotype. In contrast, the cooperation of c-Fos with oncogenic Ha-Ras or a Ras mutant selectively activating the MAPK pathway even enhanced c-Fos-induced effects. Showing the negative role in hepatocellular tumorigenesis, c-Fos repressed oncogenic Ras-driven anchorage-independent growth in vitro and strongly suppressed tumour formation in vivo. Taken together, we demonstrate that c-Fos modulates plasticity of epithelial hepatocytes and acts tumour suppressive in neoplastic hepatocytes by stimulating cell cycle inhibition and cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1974671417,"Initiation and synthesis of RNA primers in the lagging strand of the replication fork in <i>Escherichia coli</i> requires the replicative DnaB helicase and the DNA primase, the DnaG gene product. In addition, the physical interaction between these two replication enzymes appears to play a role in the initiation of chromosomal DNA replication. <i>In vitro</i>, DnaB helicase stimulates primase to synthesize primers on single-stranded (ss) oligonucleotide templates. Earlier studies hypothesized that multiple primase molecules interact with each DnaB hexamer and single-stranded DNA. We have examined this hypothesis and determined the exact stoichiometry of primase to DnaB hexamer. We have also demonstrated that ssDNA binding activity of the DnaB helicase is necessary for directing the primase to the initiator trinucleotide and synthesis of 11-20-nucleotide long primers. Although, association of these two enzymes determines the extent and rate of synthesis of the RNA primers <i>in vitro</i>, direct evidence of the formation of primase-DnaB complex has remained elusive in <i>E. coli</i> due to the transient nature of their interaction. Therefore, we stabilized this complex using a chemical cross-linker and carried out a stoichiometric analysis of this complex by gel filtration. This allowed us to demonstrate that the primase-helicase complex of <i>E. coli</i> is comprised of three molecules of primase bound to one DnaB hexamer. Fluorescence anisotropy studies of the interaction of DnaB with primase, labeled with the fluorescent probe Ru(bipy)<sub>3</sub>, and Scatchard analysis further supported this conclusion. The addition of DnaC protein, leading to the formation of the DnaB-DnaC complex, to the simple priming system resulted in the synthesis of shorter primers. Therefore, interactions of the DnaB-primase complex with other replication factors might be critical for determining the physiological length of the RNA primers <i>in vivo</i> and the overall kinetics of primer synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2014930575,"The enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase, NagA, catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-acetyl group of GlcNAc-6-P to yield glucosamine 6-phosphate and acetate, the first committed step in the biosynthetic pathway to amino-sugar-nucleotides. It is classified into carbohydrate esterase family CE-9 (see afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/). Here we report the cloning, expression, and three-dimensional structure (Protein Data Bank code 1un7) determination by x-ray crystallography of the Bacillus subtilis NagA at a resolution of 2.0 Å. The structure presents two domains, a (β/α)8 barrel enclosing the active center and a small β barrel domain. The structure is dimeric, and the substrate phosphate coordination at the active center is provided by an Arg/His pair contributed from the second molecule of the dimer. Both the overall structure and the active center bear a striking similarity to the urease superfamily with two metals involved in substrate binding and catalysis. PIXE (Proton-Induced x-ray Emission) data show that iron is the predominant metal in the purified protein. We propose a catalytic mechanism involving proton donation to the leaving group by aspartate, nucleophilic attack by an Fe-bridged hydroxide, and stabilization of the carbonyl oxygen by one of the two Fe atoms of the pair.

The first committed step in the biosynthetic pathway to the amino-sugar precursors required for cell wall peptidoglycan and teichioic acid biosynthesis in Bacillus subtilis is the deacetylation of GlcNAc 1The abbreviations used are: GlcNAc, N-acetyl glucosamine; GlcN, glucosamine; CE, carbohydrate esterase (deacetylase); PEG, polyethylene glycol; PIXE, Proton-Induced x-ray Emission; ORF, open reading frame; r.m.s., root mean square.-6-P to yield acetate and GlcN-6-P (Fig. 1). This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase (EC 3.5.1.25) NagA (Fig. 1b). In Escherichia coli, where the enzyme is known to be a homotetramer (1.Souza J.M.

J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3842-3847Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Neither E. coli nor B. subtilis can convert GlcNAc-6-P to GlcNAc-1-P directly, so the conversion to GlcN-6-P is a prerequisite for conversion to GlcN-1-P by phosphoglucosamine mutase, which can then be acylated and uridylated to UDP-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. Given its position at the crossroads of these bacteria-specific processes, NagA has warranted attention as a potential drug target. Indeed, sugar deacetylation is a validated therapeutic target in other contexts (5.Ronning D.R. Klabunde T. Besra G.S. Vissa V.D. Belisle J.T. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct.

The enzymes involved in the deesterification/de-N-acetylation of carbohydrates have been classified into 13 families 2See afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/. based upon amino acid sequence similarities. Given the vast diversity of esterases and their frequent lack of specificity, this classification is arguably not as powerful as the related classifications of glycoside hydrolases and glycosyltransferases. However, the enzymes involved in the de-N-acetylation of GlcNAc-6-P do all lie in a single sequence-related family termed CE-9. As of September 11, 2003, there are 134 members, the vast majority from bacterial sources. Sequence searches using PSI-BLAST (7.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar) pointed to a three-dimensional structure involving a urease-like bimetallic center different to the known carbohydrate esterases. The majority of carbohydrate esterases/deacetylases whose structures are reported display a classical β/α/β “serine protease” fold as revealed by three-dimensional structures of the enzymes from families CE-1 (8.Prates J.A.M.

Vissa V.D. Belisle J.T. Sacchettini J.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A small deviation from this canonical fold is displayed in the CE-12 rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase (11.Mølgaard A. Kauppinen S. Larsen S. Structure. 2000; 8: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus far, the only two “outliers” to this trend are the CE-8 pectin methylesterase, which instead presents a twin-aspartate catalytic center grafted upon a right-handed parallel β-helix (12.Jenkins J. Mayans O. Smith D. Worboys K. Pickersgill R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 951-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and LpxC zinc-dependent UDP-3-O-acetyl-N-acetylglucosamine deacetylases from family CE-11, which present an unusual twin-zinc site on a novel α/β framework (6.Coggins B.E.

Chistianson D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8146-8150Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Here we present the expression and purification of the B. subtilis NagA and an analysis of its metal-ion content through proton-induced x-ray emission data. The three-dimensional structure is reported at 2.0 Å in complex with the reaction product GlcN-6-P (and partial occupancy of unhydrolyzed substrate GlcNAc-6-P). The structure reveals NagA to be a member of the “urease superfamily” with a catalytic center involving a binuclear Fe center. The complexes permit a proposal for the catalytic mechanism for NagA equally applicable to other urease superfamily members. Cloning and Protein Production—The nagA gene was cloned into the Gateway Entry vector pDONR201 (Invitrogen) by incorporating attB sequences into the PCR oligonucleotides used to amplify the coding region from chromosomal DNA of B. subtilis strain IG20 (168 Trp–). The cloned fragment was transferred into the T7 promoter-based expression vector pDEST14 by recombination and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3), a strain with an inducible T7 RNA polymerase gene (Novagen). For protein production, cell cultures were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to an optical density of 0.7 at 600 nm before induction of protein expression by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 3 h of incubation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted by sonication. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation, applied to a Q-Sepharose column, and resolved using a linear gradient of increasing sodium chloride. Fractions containing NagA were concentrated and further purified by gel filtration (Superdex200 HR10/30, Amersham Biosciences) in a 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 200 mm NaCl buffer with the apparent molecular mass estimated by comparison to standard protein markers. Pure fractions of NagA were pooled, washed into 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and concentrated to 50 mg/ml using a 10-kDa centrifugation membrane (Vivaspin). Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing—In the absence of substrate, NagA crystals could be grown using 0.2 m lithium acetate dihydrate, 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 (pH 7.8) as a precipitant but they diffracted poorly. NagA (0.23 mm) was incubated for 20 min at 4 °C in a 1 mm GlcNAc-6-P solution. Crystals were grown by vaporphase diffusion using the hanging drop method with an equal volume (1 μl) of protein/substrate and reservoir solution composed of 8% (w/v) PEG 20,000, 8% (v/v) PEG 550 monomethyl ether, 0.1 m HEPES (pH 7.5), and 0.3 m sodium acetate. A single NagA/substrate co-crystal was transferred to a solution of mother liquor with 25% PEG 550 monomethyl ether as a cryoprotectant and flash-cooled to 120 K in a rayon loop. Diffraction quality was assessed using a home source. A single wavelength experiment was conducted on beamline ID14-1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility at Grenoble at a temperature of 100 K using an ADSC CCD detector. Data were integrated, scaled, and reduced using DENZO and SCALEPACK (14.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The crystals are orthorhombic with unit cell dimensions of a = 51.68, b = 107.73, and c = 188.25 Å, corresponding to a solvent content of 60% with two molecules (hereafter designated Amol and Bmol) in the asymmetric unit. All further crystallographic computations were carried out using the CCP4 suite of programs (15.Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar). Phasing, Model Building, and Refinement—The structure was solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe (16.Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar) using the structure of the protein from the Thermotoga maritima ORF TM0184 (Protein Data Bank code 1O12 derived from a Structural Genomics program, www.jcsg.org/), which has 33% identity with B. subtilis NagA, as a search model. The data exhibit pseudosymmetry characterized by a peak at x = 0.5, y = 0.5, and z = 0.5 in the native Patterson map with a peak height of 80% of the origin peak (when calculated with data between 10 and 2.0Å). Therefore, the data can nearly be described as belonging to space group I222, making it difficult to assign the exact primitive space group because the systematic absences, which could be attributed to screw axes, are also caused by the pseudosymmetry. The space group was determined by running AMoRe (including rigid-body optimization of the best solutions) in every subgroup of I222. The clearest solution was obtained in space group P21212 with a correlation coefficient of 55.4% and an R-factor of 51.7%, some 1.5% “better” on each statistic in this space group than in any other. The electron density map calculated from the model was difficult to interpret. Several cycles of the REFMAC/ARP-WARP program in warpNtrace mode (17.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar, 18.Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) resulted in the automatic building of the main chain of most of the α-helices and β-sheets, but attempts at automatic assignment of the sequence failed. Manual rebuilding was therefore performed with the X-Autofit module in the program Quanta (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). The model was refined using REFMAC (17.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) interspersed with manual rebuilding using X-Autofit in Quanta. The final model contains 5902 non-hydrogen protein atoms, 626 water molecules, 4 metal-ions, 2 polyethylene glycol molecules, and 2 GlcN-6-P molecules. The crystallographic R-factor and R-free values (19.Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3864) Google Scholar) are 0.20 and 0.25, respectively (Table I).

Open table in a new tab MicroPIXE Determination of Bound Metals—MicroPIXE (Proton-Induced x-ray Emission) measurements were carried out on the National Ion Beam Centre at the University of Surrey on a beamline arranged as described previously (21.Grime G. Dawson M. Marsh M. McArthur I.C. Watt F. Nucl. Instr. Methods Phys. Res. B. 1991; 54: 52-63Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). A 2–3-MeV proton beam of 1-μm diameter was used to induce characteristic x-ray emission from crystals dried onto a 2-μm thick mylar film pre-tensioned over a 1-cm hole in an aluminum target holder and held in vacuum. X-rays were detected in a solid-state lithium-drifted silicon detector with high energy resolution. The proton beam was scanned spatially in X and Y and by placing software windows round the x-rays in the spectrum associated with particular elements, and by sorting these events into an X-Y grid, maps could be obtained of all elements heavier than neon that were present in the sample. The Rutherford backscattered proton spectrum measured in the chamber using a silicon surface barrier detector was used to get an accurate thickness of the sample to correct for self-absorption of the x-rays. Quantitative information was obtained by collecting spectra at 3 or 4 points on the crystal and also on the backing foil. These spectra are analyzed using GUPIX (22.Johansson S. Campbell J.L. Malmqvist Q.G. Particle Induced X-ray Emission Spectrometry. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar) to extract the areal density of each element of interest in the sample. The number of atoms of each element per protein molecule can then be computed from the ratio of that element to the sulfur measurement and from knowledge of the number of Cys and Met residues in the protein. This internal sulfur calibration allows much more accurate quantitation (normally approximately ± 10%) than would be possible if absolute measurements were necessary. Overall Structure—The B. subtilis NagA exists as a dimer in solution as determined by gel filtration and dynamic light scattering data (data not shown). The crystals of NagA contain two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The two molecules involved in what we believe is the active dimer (see below) are related by the crystallographic 2-fold symmetry around the c axis. The polypeptide chain is visible from residues 3 to 394 in each molecule. The monomer folds into two structural domains (Fig. 2a), an (α/β)8 barrel (residues 59–332) enclosing the catalytic site of the enzyme and a small β-strand barrel made up from secondary structure elements contributed by the N and C termini (residues 3–58 and 368–394). The secondary structure of NagA as defined by the program DSSP (23.Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12335) Google Scholar) is shown in Fig. 2b. The (α/β)8 barrel is a somewhat distorted “TIM-barrel” fold, the connections between the β-strands and the helices are equivalent apart from an excursion of a small three-stranded β-sheet between β8 and α8 that closes one end of the (α/β)8 barrel and contribute residues involved in ligand interaction (see below). The second domain is an eight-stranded sheet that wraps into an incomplete β barrel. Five of the β-strands come from the N-terminal region of the enzyme (βA to E) and form the main part of the β barrel with two curved β-strands (βA and B). Finally, three other β-strands lie “on top” of the others and belong to the C-terminal region of the enzyme (βK to M). A DALI search (24.Holm L. Sander C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 478-480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar) reveals a structural relationship between the catalytic domain and a large family of metal-dependent hydrolases with a similar barrel as described by SCOP (25.Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5595) Google Scholar), which includes urease, phosphotriesterase, and hydantoinase (26.Holm L. Sander C. Proteins. 1997; 28: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 27.May O. Habenicht A. Mattes R. Syldatk C. Siemann M. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 743-747PubMed Google Scholar). A subset of this family, now including NagA, is characterized by the presence of an all-β-strand domain made up of composite elements from the N and C termini (25.Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5595) Google Scholar). The interface-accessible surface area is 1054 Å2, which represents 7% of the total (28.Jones S. Thornton J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar). The two molecules are related by 180°-rotational symmetry, and a loop between β6 and α6 forms an arm, which contacts its neighbor subunit across the dimer interface. There are two salt bridges between Asp-246 and Lys-265 and a number of hydrogen bond contacts between α6 and α7 to their symmetric equivalents with water excluded from the interface. A comparison with the original search model derived from the T. maritima ORF TM0184, which crystallized in space group P3121, shows a very similar fold with an r.m.s. deviation of 1.96 Å for 354 Cα atoms of the monomer (calculated with the program QUANTA (29.Oldfield T.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 82-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)). The relative orientation of the two molecules of the T. maritima dimer is slightly different and reflected in an r.m.s. deviation of 6.18 Å for 706 Cα atoms of the dimer. The highest deviations occur in the β barrel domain (∼6.36 Å for βC, βD, and βE) and in the loops connecting α2 to β3 and α4 to β5 (∼5 Å). Only one iron ion is observed in the structure of ORF TM0184, and it superposes with Fe-2 of NagA and interacts with the same residue types (His-176, His-197, and Glu-115). The implications of this finding are described below. The Catalytic Site and Substrate Binding—Electron density, corresponding to the reaction product GlcN-6-P, was clearly visible in the cavity of the (α/β) barrel (Fig. 3b) (30.White R.J. Pasternak C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 41: 497-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In one molecule, there is residual difference density suggesting a partial (<0.3) occupancy of unhydrolyzed substrate, GlcNAc-6-P, and although partial occupancy of substrate sheds light on catalysis (see “Discussion”), it was not refined due to the constraint of limited resolution. GlcN-6-P binds in the cavity through side chain interactions with Asn-226 to the phosphate group, His-258 to the 1′-sugar hydroxyl, and main chain hydrogen bonds (Fig. 4). A putative catalytic acid (discussed below), Asp-281, is positioned close to the scissile bond. Strikingly, the phosphate also makes contact with a pair of side chains, His-233 and Arg-234, which form a pincer-like extension from the β6-α6 loop contributed from the partner subunit (Fig. 5). In the T. maritima structure, the equivalent residues (His-207 and Arg-208) point toward the solvent, suggesting that they are solicited only in the presence of the ligand in the cavity. The recruitment of residues from an adjacent partner subunit in a homo-oligomer toward substrate binding is unusual but not unique. The 180°-rotational symmetry between two monomers of granzymeA is used in the functional dimer to form an extended substrate-binding cleft (31.Bell J.K. Goetz D.H. Mahrus S. Harris J.L.

Because this sample had no additional sulfur in the buffer, the number of atoms for these elements per protein molecule (i.e. per 12 sulfur atoms) could be calculated and averaged from individual point spectra: iron 1.3 (±0.2); zinc 0.21 (±0.03); manganese 0.17 (±0.02); potassium 0.11 (±0.02); and copper 0.05 (±0.02). Because iron was the predominant metal atom found in the purified protein (grown from E. coli in LB medium), iron was modeled in the electron density. The two Fe ions are situated in the bottom of the active site. One is more buried (Fe-2) and makes four interactions with protein side chains (His-63 and His-65 on β1, Glu 136 from the end of β3 and the active site Asp-281), and the other (Fe-1) is held in position by His-223, His-202, and Glu-136. The two metal atoms are 3.5 Å apart and refine with B-factors of 26 Å2 for Fe-2 and 21 Å2 for Fe-1 in each molecule of the asymmetric unit. A comparison of NagA protein sequences from Gram-negative, Gram-positive, and archeal bacteria highlights other residues important for NagA structure and function (Fig. 6). There are four residues in the NagA structure whose backbone dihedral angles fall outside of the normal range as defined by a Ramachandran plot (36.Ramakrishnan C. Ramachandran G.N. Biophys. J. 1965; 5: 909-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). A cis-proline (Pro-138) is conserved and occurs in a Gly-Pro motif immediately after Glu-136 at the end of β3, which bridges the two Fe ions. The metal-binding His-223 is held at an unusual angle (ψ = 26.1, φ = 72.2) by the side chain of Glu-251, and Tyr-225 (ψ = 86.7, φ = –27.5) also displays a high energy conformation, which allows the substrate-binding Asn-226 side chain to turn back toward the substrate. Ser-344 (ψ = –152.1, φ = –59.3) mediates a tight turn between αA and αB. The substrate-binding residue His-258 is held in position by the side chain of Asp-255, which is conserved. The barrel is completed by an interaction between the conserved residues Thr-280 (β8) and Asp-61 on strand β1. The alignment also highlights some potential differences between NagA sequences of B. subtilis and E. coli. The inter-subunit salt linkage, which is conserved between B. subtilis and T. maritima NagA proteins, appears to be absent in the same position of the E. coli sequence. Although the phosphate-binding residue Arg-234 is conserved in all of the three sequences, its partner, His-233, is not present in E. coli NagA. Perhaps the biggest difference is that Gln and Asn residues in E. coli NagA replace the residues His-63 and His-65, which bind Fe-2 and coordinate the active site Asp-281. The structural superfamily of metal-dependent hydrolases includes enzymes with highly diverse substrates. This family has been coined an “evolutionary treasure” (26.Holm L. Sander C. Proteins. 1997; 28: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The trove has expanded with structural characterization of predicted family members (27.May O. Habenicht A. Mattes R. Syldatk C. Siemann M. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 743-747PubMed Google Scholar) including isoaspartyldipeptidase (37.Thoden J.B. Marti-Arbona R. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4874-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), N-acyl-d-aminoacylase (38.Liaw S.H. Chen S.J. Ko T.P. Hsu C.S. Chen C.J. Wang A.H. Tsai Y.C. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 321: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and now NagA. A recurrent feature in the family is the post-translational modification of a lysine residue on strand β4 to a carboxylated form, which serves to bridge two metal-ions in the catalytic site. In an interesting variation, both NagA and renal dipeptidases have exploited glutamate carboxylates in a similar spatial position, which are instead donated from strand β3 of the β barrel to serve the same role, which may be one reason that NagA was not predicted as a family member by the original grouping based on primary sequence (26.Holm L. Sander C. Proteins. 1997; 28: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Another unusual feature of NagA is that across species there are inconsistencies in the gene order and chromosomal operon structure. In E. coli, nagA is in an operon with components of the import GlcNAc phophoenol pyruvate-phosphotransferase system. Although the same is true in some Gram-positive organisms, such as Bacillus sphaericus (40.Alice A.F. Perez-Martinez G. Sanchez-Rivas C. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 1687-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), many Bacillus nagA genes are in a short operon with nagB, which encodes a GlcN-6P deaminase/epimerase. In B. subtilis, the two genes overlap by 2 bp and in an extreme case by 13 bp in Bacillus halodurans, strongly suggesting that they are co-transcribed and translated. Indeed, there may be some real differences between the GlcNAc deacetyl"

Results of several clinical studies strongly indicate that the NE cell population is greatly increased in prostate carcinomas during androgen ablation therapy that correlates with hormone-refractory growth and poor prognosis. However, the mechanism of NE cell enrichment in prostate carcinoma remains an enigma. We investigated the molecular mechanism by which androgen-sensitive C-33 LNCaP human prostate cancer cells become NE-like cells in an androgen-reduced environment, mimicking clinical phenomenon. In the androgen-depleted condition, androgen-sensitive C-33 LNCaP cells gradually acquired the NE-like morphology and expressed an increased level of neuron-specific enolase (NSE), a classical marker of neuronal cells. Several NE-like subclone cells were established. Biochemical characterizations of these subclone cells showed that receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase alpha (RPTPalpha) is elevated and ERK is constitutively activated, several folds higher than that in parental cells. In androgen-depleted condition, PD98059, an MEK inhibitor, could efficiently block not only the activation of ERK, but also the acquisition of the NE-like morphology and the elevation of NSE in C-33 LNCaP cells. In RPTPalpha cDNA-transfected C-33 LNCaP cells, ERK was activated and NSE was elevated. In those cells in the presence of PD98059, the ERK activation and NSE elevation were abolished, following a dose-response fashion. Additionally, in constitutively active MEK mutant cDNA-transfected C-33 LNCaP cells, ERK was activated and NSE level was elevated, and cells obtained the NE-like phenotype. Our data collectively indicated that RPTPalpha signaling via ERK is involved in the NE transdifferentiation of androgen-sensitive C-33 LNCaP human prostate cancer cells in the androgen-depleted condition."

https://openalex.org/W2034883068,"Diacylglycerol (DAG) is a versatile molecule that participates as substrate in the synthesis of structural and energetic lipids, and acts as the physiological signal that activates protein kinase C. Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT), the last committed enzyme in triacylglycerol synthesis, could potentially regulate the content and use of both signaling and glycerolipid substrate DAG by converting it into triacylglycerol. To test this hypothesis, we stably overexpressed the DGAT1 mouse gene in human lung SV40-transformed fibroblasts (DGAT cells), which contains high levels of DAG. DGAT cells exhibited a 3.9-fold higher DGAT activity and a 3.2-fold increase in triacylglycerol content, whereas DAG and phosphatidylcholine decreased by 70 and 20%, respectively, compared with empty vector-transfected SV40 cells (Control cells). Both acylation and de novo synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin were reduced by 30–40% in DGAT cells compared with controls, suggesting that DGAT used substrates for triacylglycerol synthesis that had originally been destined to produce phospholipids. The incorporation of [14C]DAG and [14C]fatty acids released from plasma membrane by additions of either phospholipase C or phospholipase A2 into triacylglycerol was increased by 6.2- and 2.8-fold, respectively, in DGAT cells compared with control cells, indicating that DGAT can attenuate signaling lipids. Finally, DGAT overexpression reversed the neoplastic phenotype because it dramatically reduced the cell growth rate and suppressed the anchorage-independent growth of the SV40 cells. These results strongly support the view that DGAT participates in the regulation of membrane lipid synthesis and lipid signaling, thereby playing an important role in modulating cell growth properties.

These results strongly support the view that DGAT participates in the regulation of membrane lipid synthesis and lipid signaling, thereby playing an important role in modulating cell growth properties. Amphipatic lipids, such as diacylglycerols (DAG) 1The abbreviations used are: DAGdiacylglycerolBSAbovine serum albuminDGATdiacylglycerol acyltransferaseFBSfetal bovine serumMEMminimal essential mediumPCphosphatidylcholinePEphosphatidylethanolaminePKCprotein kinase CPLA2phospholipase A2PLCphospholipase CPBSphosphate-buffered salineSMsphingomyelin. and acyl-CoAs exhibit dual actions, as substrates for membrane and energy storage glycerolipids, as well as second messengers for signaling transduction events. As a substrate for de novo glycerolipid synthesis, DAG is a common intermediate for both triacylglycerol and phospholipid synthesis. Studies performed with permeabilized cells indicate that the utilization of de novo synthesized DAG for either neutral or polar lipid synthesis is controlled by DGAT and CDP-choline (ethanolamine) phosphotransferase activities, suggesting the presence of a common DAG pool that is shared for both lipid synthetic routes (1Stals H.K. Top W. Declercq P.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 343: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, at least one other DAG pool is available for glycerolipid synthesis, because DAG that is released from triacylglycerol stores in human fibroblasts can be converted to phospholipids (2Igal R.A. Coleman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16644-16651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Moreover, hepatic cells might contain different DAG pools that are used to synthesize triacylglycerol for storage or for lipoproteins (3Wiggins D. Gibbons G.F. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 4Owen M.R. Corstorphine C.C. Zammit V.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although no definitive evidence exists for specific DAG pools for polar and neutral glycerolipid synthetic pathways, segregation of DAG toward different metabolic routes seems to occur according to the need of the cell. For instance, when phospholipid synthesis is inhibited, DAG originally destined to form phospholipids is re-directed toward triacylglycerol (5Jackowski S. Wang J. Baburina I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). diacylglycerol bovine serum albumin diacylglycerol acyltransferase fetal bovine serum minimal essential medium phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine protein kinase C phospholipase A2 phospholipase C phosphate-buffered saline sphingomyelin. Growth factors and hormones activate phospholipases C and D to promote a bi-phasic accumulation of DAG that triggers signaling events (6Wakelam M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). As a signaling effector, DAG regulates cell growth and differentiation by activating several isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC). A short-term release of DAG is caused by the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol by several isoforms of phosphoinositide-specific PLC (7Katan M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). A second wave of DAG produced by cytokine-activated PC hydrolysis is needed to fully develop mitogenesis. In this regard, quiescent fibroblasts treated with platelet-derived growth factor or bacterial PCPLC increase DAG levels and a concomitant strong mitogenic response (8Larrodera P. Cornet M.E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Lopez-Barahona M. Diaz-Laviada I. Guddal P.H. Johansen T. Moscat J. Cell. 1990; 61: 1113-1120Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Persistent accumulation of intracellular DAG has also been linked to oncogenic transformation. Thus, sustained high levels of DAG produced by overactivation of PC-PLC induce a transformed phenotype in NIH 3T3 cells (9Johansen T. Bjørkøy G. Øvervatn A. Díaz-Meco M.T. Traavik T. Moscat J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 646-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Moreover, neoplastic transformation by simian virus 40 (sv40), and by ras-, src-, and fps oncogenes is accompanied by an excess content of intracellular DAG (10Díaz-Laviada I. Larrodera P. Díaz-Meco M.T. Cornet M.E. Guddal P.H. Johansen T. Moscat J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3907-3912Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11Martin A. Duffy P.A. Liossis C. Gómez-Muñoz A. O'Brien L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Not only are appropriate intracellular levels of signaling DAG necessary for mitogenesis, but a proper supply of DAG substrate for glycerolipid synthesis is also required by proliferating cells. To prepare for mitosis, cells must synthesize new membrane phospholipids; hence precursors for phospholipid synthesis must be available. Thus, mitogenic signals stimulate the formation of new PC by activating the expression of CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (13Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3858-3867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by diverting DAG toward PC synthesis, rather than triacylglycerol formation (5Jackowski S. Wang J. Baburina I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1483: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Moreover, in neurite outgrowth induced by nerve growth factor, PC synthesis is enhanced by an increase in DAG levels together with an activation of the CDP-choline DAG phosphotransferase (14Araki W. Wurtman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11946-11950Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Membrane lipid synthesis is also up-regulated in neoplastic cells, hence a constant supply of lipid precursors for new membranes is required to sustain the unrestricted proliferation of tumor cells. In this regard, increased synthesis and turnover of phospholipids has been observed in neoplastic cells (10Díaz-Laviada I. Larrodera P. Díaz-Meco M.T. Cornet M.E. Guddal P.H. Johansen T. Moscat J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 14783-14789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DAG released from plasma membrane may also be directly incorporated into triacylglycerol, suggesting the presence of a novel mechanism for terminating DAG signals based on the synthesis of a storage lipid (22Igal R.A. Caviglia J.M. de Gómez Dumm I.N. Coleman R.A. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 88-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A key enzyme involved in DAG and triacylglycerol metabolism is acyl-CoA-diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) (23Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y-W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C.

DGAT1, and the recently discovered DGAT2 (24Cases S. Stone S.J. Zhou P. Yen E. Tow B. Lardizabal K.D. Voelker T. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Biol.

The DAG used as a DGAT substrate is primarily derived from the de novo glycerol 3-phosphate pathway. Other sources of DAG for triacylglycerol synthesis include that produced from monoacylglycerol in intestinal cells (25Cao J. Lockwood J. Burn P. Shi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13860-13866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), from the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol (2Igal R.A. Coleman R.A. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 88-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because both DGAT genes are widely expressed in mouse and human tissues (23Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y-W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C. Welch C.B. Lusis A.L. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 38870-38876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar), the presence of two DGAT enzymes in non-adipose tissues suggests that the synthesis of triacylglycerol might be linked to cell functions other than energy storage. For instance, adenoviral expression of DGAT1 in pancreatic islets increased the formation of triacylglycerol by 100% but impaired the secretion of insulin after glucose stimulation (26Kelpe C.L. Johnson S.L. Poitout V. Endocrinology. 2002; 43: 3326-3332Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To understand the role of DGAT in terminating DAG signals, we tested the hypothesis that DGAT overexpression channels DAG and/or fatty acids toward triacylglycerol, thereby sequestering either proliferative lipid signals and/or lipid substrates for membrane biogenesis with a consequent decrease in phospholipid synthesis, normalization of cell proliferation, and a reversion in the abnormal cytological phenotype. Materials—Normal human lung fibroblasts (WI38) and the derived SV40-transformed strain were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). LipofectAMINE™, cell culture media, G418 (Geneticin™) antibiotic, and other culture reagents were from Invitrogen. Ultrafiltered fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Gensa (Buenos Aires, Argentina). Cell culture supplies were from Greiner BioOne (Frickenhausen, Germany). Restriction enzymes and other molecular biology reagents were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). [14C]Oleic acid and [γ-32P]ATP were from Amersham Biosciences, [methyl-14C]choline and [3H]glycerol were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA), phospholipase A2 (PLA2, from Naja naja), PC-specific phospholipase C (PCPLC, from Bacillus cereus), and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody were from Sigma. Pure lipid standards were from Doosan Serdary (Yongin, Korea). 1,6-Diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene was purchased from Aldrich. Silica Gel 60 chromatography plates were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Analytical-grade solvents were from Carlo Erba (Milano, Italy). DAG kinase membrane suspension was from Calbiochem. Cell Culture—Cells were routinely cultured in 100-mm Petri dishes in minimum essential medium with Earle's salts (MEM) with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 1% penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (10 μg/ml), 1% nonessential amino acids, and 1% MEM vitamins (growing medium), at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity. Normal human lung fibroblasts were used for the experiments before reaching the 20th passage. Generation of Stable DGAT1 Overexpressing SV40-transformed Cells—Mouse DGAT1 cDNA with an N-terminal FLAG epitope (kind gift of Dr. Robert V. Farese Jr., Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, University of California) was cloned into the restriction sites EcoRV and XbaI of a pCDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). SV40-transformed cells, grown in 100-mm dishes up to 50% confluence, were washed twice with serum-free Opti-MEM and then transfected with 12 μg of either DGAT1-pCDNA3 plasmid or empty vector plus 35 μl of LipofectAMINE™ (2 mg/ml) in 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM plus 20% FBS. After 5 h incubation, medium was replaced by 10% FBS MEM and transfected cells were grown for an additional 24 h. Then, positive transfectants were selected by culturing the cells in 10% FBS, MEM containing geneticin (600 μg/ml) for 15 days. Ten DGAT1-transfected clones were isolated by using cloning cylinders and were grown in 100-mm Petri dishes with 10% FBS, MEM plus G418 antibiotic (300 μg/ml) for 15 days. Triacylglycerol synthetic rate and content were analyzed in each DGAT-transfected clone, as well as in empty vector-transfected SV40 cells (Control cells), and two DGAT clones (DGAT-A and DGAT-V cells) that showed the highest synthesis of triacylglycerol (measured by the incorporation of [14C]oleate into lipids during a 24-h period) were selected for the experiments. Metabolic Labeling—Preconfluent control and DGAT cells, cultured in 60-mm dishes, were incubated for up to 48 h either with [14C]oleic acid (0.25 μCi/dish), [3H]glycerol (5 μCi/dish) or [methyl-14C]choline (0.5μCi/dish), in the presence or absence of 100 μm oleate, in 10% FBS, MEM supplemented with 0.5% BSA. At the end of each labeling period, the radioactive medium was discarded and cell monolayers were washed twice with 0.1% BSA in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), to eliminate residual label on the cell surface. Next, cells were scraped from the dishes with two additions of 1 ml of ice-cold methanol and 0.5 ml of H2O. Total cellular lipids were obtained according to the procedure of Bligh and Dyer (27Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42875) Google Scholar) and aqueous and lipid fractions were concentrated in a Savant SpeedVac concentrator. Analysis and Quantitation of Lipids and Choline-derived Metabolites—For mass lipid determinations, cells were grown until near confluence in 100-mm dishes and total lipid extracts were obtained as described above. Neutral and polar lipids species were separated on Silica Gel 60 thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates using one-dimensional single development procedures. Routinely, neutral lipid separation was carried out with the following solvent system:hexane:ethyl ether:acetic acid, 80:20:2 (by volume). Polar lipid species were resolved in a solvent system consisting of chloroform:methanol:ammonium hydroxide:water, 50:37.5:3.5:2 (by volume). Known amounts of pure lipid standards were seeded and run on the TLC plates in parallel to samples. To both solvent systems 100 μm 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene was added to visualize the lipid spots on the plate under UV light (22Igal R.A. Caviglia J.M. de Gómez Dumm I.N. Coleman R.A. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 88-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescent lipid spots from samples and standards were photographed and lipid mass was quantified using a DS120 Kodak Image system. For the [14C] and [3H] labeling experiments, individual fluorescent lipid spots were scraped into plastic vials and radioactivity levels were determined in a liquid scintillation counter. To separate water-soluble choline metabolites, aqueous phases were dried and dissolved in H2O, spotted on silica gel chromatoplates, and resolved with 0.6% sodium chloride, methanol, 30% ammonium hydroxide; 50:50:5 (by volume). Pure standards were used as carriers and were added to the samples before chromatography. Radioactive spots were detected in a Berthold II radiometric scanner, scraped into vials, and counted. Total 1,2-DAG was quantitated by the DAG kinase assay according to the procedure of Preiss et al. (28Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using [γ-32P]ATP as substrate. The results of lipid determinations were expressed in nanomoles of lipid per mg of protein. Cell Proliferation—To evaluate cell growth, 1.5 × 104 cells were seeded in duplicate 60-mm dishes. Twenty-four hours later, medium was removed and replaced with fresh growing medium. At this time and up to 144 h cells were then trypsinized, and counted in an hemocytometer. Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation into Total DNA—To measure the rate of DNA synthesis, cells grown in triplicate 60-mm dishes were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/dish) in 2 ml of growing media for 3 h at 37 °C. Media was removed and cell monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and then precipitated with 5% trichloroacetic acid for 10 min at 4 °C. The acid-insoluble material was solubilized with 0.2% SDS in 0.1 n NaOH and an aliquot was counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Cloning in Soft Agar—Control and DGAT cells were plated in quadruplicates at 1 × 104 cells per 60-mm dishes in MEM containing 10% FBS and 0.3% (w/v) agar onto a bottom layer of 0.6 (w/v) agar in MEM. After 3 and 5 weeks, the presence or absence of multicellular colonies (more than eight cells) in both cell groups was verified under the microscope. For macroscopic analysis, cell colonies were stained with ethidium bromide in PBS for 30 min, visualized, and photographed under UV light. Cell Radiolabeling and Phospholipase Treatments—Near confluent control and DGAT cells grown in 60-mm dishes were incubated with trace amounts of [14C]oleic acid (0.25 μCi/dish) in growing medium supplemented with 0.5% BSA for 48 h. After labeling, medium was removed and monolayers were washed twice with 0.1% BSA in warm PBS. Next, cells were treated with 10 units/dish of either PC-PLC or PLA2, or 100 μm oleic acid, for 6 h. After these treatments, the medium was discarded, and cell monolayers were washed with ice-cold PBS and scraped with two additions of ice-cold methanol. Lipid extraction and separation, as well as the quantitation of radioactivity levels of lipid species, were performed as stated above. DGAT Enzyme Assay—Cells were grown in 100-mm Petri dishes until 80–90% confluence. Cells were then trypsinized, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cell homogenates were obtained by sonication on an ice-water bath for 10 s at 50% output and stored at -70 °C until use. DGAT activity was determined using 100 and 200 μg of cell homogenate protein, 200 μm diacylglycerol in acetone, and 30 μm [3H]palmitoyl-CoA following the procedure of Coleman (29Coleman R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 134-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis of FLAG-DGAT—Preconfluent control and DGAT cells were homogenized in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS plus 1% protease inhibitor mixture by sonication in an ice-water bath. Proteins from total cell homogenates (150 μg) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking, membranes were incubated with mouse anti-FLAG as primary antibody and donkey anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate as secondary antibody. Visualization of FLAG-DGAT protein was performed using a SuperSignal West Pico detection kit (Pierce). Other Methods—Protein content was measured as described by Lowry et al. (30Lowry O.R. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]Palmitoyl-CoA was synthesized enzymatically (31Merrill Jr., A.H. Gidwitz S. Bell R.M. J. Lipid Res. 1982; 23: 1368-1373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stable DGAT Overexpression Results in Massive Accumulation of Triacylglycerol and a Decrease in the Levels of DAG and PC—From a pool of SV40-transformed cells transfected with DGAT1 cDNA and selected by resistance to G418 antibiotic resistance, several clones of DGAT overexpressing cells were isolated. Two clones, DGAT-A and DGAT-V, which had the highest rate of TAG synthesis and TAG content were selected for the experiments. DGAT-A cells exhibited a high level of FLAG-DGAT protein expression (Fig. 1A), which correlated with a 3.9-fold increase in the in vitro DGAT activity (Fig. 1B), when compared with control cells. In addition, the DGAT-V cells exhibited a 10-fold increase in DGAT activity over the controls. However, because this DGAT-overexpressing clone showed an extremely low cell proliferation rate (see below), because of feasibility, most of the experiments were performed using the DGAT-A clone. To determine whether FLAG-DGAT protein was functional in the whole cells, the content of triacylglycerol mass in control and DGAT-A cells was analyzed by TLC and densitometric scanning. Accordingly, DGAT-A cells showed a 3.2-fold increase in triacylglycerol levels, with respect to control cells (Fig. 1, C and D). These cells also exhibited a higher level of cholesteryl esters, but this finding was not further investigated. We also observed that triacylglycerol accumulated as numerous small cytosolic droplets (Oil Red O sensitive) surrounding the nucleus (data not shown). This pattern of triacylglycerol depot was similar to that observed in other non-adipose cells (32Wolins N.E. Rubin B. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5101-5108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), indicating that no aberrant localization of triacylglycerol droplets occurred in the DGAT-overexpressing cells. Taken as a whole, this group of observations indicate that the DGAT-transfected clones contained high amounts of functional DGAT enzyme that promoted the accumulation of its product triacylglycerol. Additionally, the mass of the main phospholipids, PC and PE, as well as 1,2-DAG was determined in control cells and DGAT overexpressors (Table I). PC content decreased ∼20% in DGAT-A cells compared with empty vector-transfected SV40 cells, whereas the levels of PE did not show significant changes between the cell groups. Interestingly, the content of total 1,2-DAG in DGAT cells was reduced by 70% with respect to control values, strongly suggesting that the overexpressed DGAT activity is depleting the DAG sources that can be used for phospholipid production by preferentially channeling this lipid intermediate into triacylglycerol stores.Table ILevels of PC, PE, and 1,2-DAG in control and DGAT-A cells SV40-transformed cells stably transfected with either empty vector (Control) or DGAT1 cDNA (DGAT-A) were grown until near confluence in MEM, 10% FBS in the presence of 300 μg/ml geneticin. Cells were harvested and the content of lipid species was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values represent mean ± S.D. of three separate determinations (PC and PE) or the average of duplicate determinations for two independent experiments, with a difference between determinations of less than 10% (1,2-DAG).Nanomole of lipid/mg proteinControlDGAT-APC156 ± 14121 ± 16ap < 0.05, Student's t testPE58 ± 1267 ± 111,2-DAG0.4090.116a p < 0.05, Student's t test Open table in a new tab Synthesis of Neutral Lipids Versus Polar Lipids in DGAT Overexpressing Cells: Regulation of Lipid Partitioning by DGAT—Because it has been hypothesized that PC and triacylglycerol biosynthetic pathways share the same pool of lipid substrates, we analyzed both the synthesis of neutral and polar lipids in control and DGAT-overexpressing cells incubated with traces of [14C]oleic acid. Labeling of total lipids was slightly decreased (∼20%) in DGAT-A cells compared with controls. When the synthesis of the [14C]lipid species was analyzed, it was observed that the formation of triacylglycerol was 2.3- and 5.5-fold higher in DGAT cells than in control cells at 24 and 48 h, respectively (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, synthesis of total polar lipids was decreased by 35% in DGAT overexpressors, both at 24 and 48 h (Fig. 2B). Decreases in both PC and PE, the only polar lipid species labeled with [14C]oleate in both cell groups, accounted for the lower phospholipid labeling (data not shown). Additionally, the levels of cellular [14C]1,2-DAG, measured after a 24-h incubation with trace amounts of [14C]oleate, was ∼30% decreased in DGAT cells compared with empty vector-transfected cells (6694 ± 836 versus 4602 ± 608 dpm/mg of protein, respectively). This observation further confirms that DGAT overexpression preferentially redirects DAG molecules toward the synthesis of triacylglycerol, decreasing the DAG pool available for the formation of phospholipids. Oleic acid can act as a substrate for both acylation of preexisting phospholipids as well as for the de novo synthesis of polar lipids, whereas labeled glycerol is a substrate exclusively for the de novo synthetic pathway, therefore labeling of lipids with [3H]glycerol would help to determine whether this route is specifically affected by DGAT overexpression. Thus, preconfluent control and DGAT-A cells were labeled with [3H]glycerol for 24 h in the presence of 100 μm oleate to enhance lipid synthesis, and labeled neutral and total phospholipids were analyzed. The incorporation of [3H]glycerol into total cell lipids was significantly depressed in DGAT cells compared with the mock-transfected group (Fig. 3), suggesting a specific down-regulation of the de novo pathway for glycerolipid formation in the DGAT overexpressors. However, despite a decreased de novo lipid formation, most of the [3H]glycerol was incorporated into triacylglycerol in DGAT cells at the expense of both PC and PE labeling (Fig. 3, inset), indicating that de novo synthesized lipid substrates were re-directed toward the synthesis of triacylglycero"

https://openalex.org/W2074261724,"4E-BP3 is a member of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F-binding protein family of translational repressors. eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) inhibit translation initiation by sequestering eIF4E, the cap-binding protein, from eIF4G thus preventing ribosome recruitment to the mRNA. Previous analysis of 4E-BP3 expression uncovered an 8.5-kb mRNA variant of unknown origin. To study this splice variant, we determined the structure of the genomic locus encoding human 4E-BP3 (EIF4EBP3). EIF4EBP3 is located on human chromosome 5q31.3 and comprises three exons (A, B, and C) and two introns. Exon B contains the region of the open reading frame responsible for eIF4E binding. GenBank™ searches revealed multiple expressed sequence tags originating from the alternative splicing of exon B with unidentified upstream exons. Further studies revealed that the 8.5-kb transcript arises from the fusion of EIF4EBP3 with the mammalian homologue of Drosophila MASK (multiple ankyrin repeats, single KH domain), which is crucial for photoreceptor differentiation, cell survival, and proliferation. Surprisingly, the open reading frame of the MASK-BP3 transcript is different from that of 4E-BP3, which indicates that exon B is translated using an alternative reading frame. A gene fusion similar to that of MASK and EIF4EBP3 has been reported only once in mammals for the UEV1-Kua transcript. The use of an alternative reading frame is also very rare, having been described for two loci, INK4a/ARF and XLαs/ALEX. The simultaneous exploitation of both mechanisms underscores the flexibility of mammalian genomes and has important implications for the functional analysis of 4E-BP3 and MASK. Interestingly, both eIF4E and MASK are downstream effectors of the Ras/MAPK pathway, which provides a rationale for the MASK-BP3 fusion in mammals. 4E-BP3 is a member of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F-binding protein family of translational repressors. eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs) inhibit translation initiation by sequestering eIF4E, the cap-binding protein, from eIF4G thus preventing ribosome recruitment to the mRNA.

Interestingly, both eIF4E and MASK are downstream effectors of the Ras/MAPK pathway, which provides a rationale for the MASK-BP3 fusion in mammals. The control of translation rates in eukaryotes is an important means to regulate gene expression. Translational control occurs mainly at the rate-limiting initiation step during which the 40 S ribosomal subunit is recruited to the mRNA (1Poulin F. Sonenberg N. Lapointe J. Brakier-Gingras L.

Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 1-31Google Scholar). Ribosomal recruitment is facilitated by the 5′-cap structure (m7GpppN, where N is any nucleotide) present on most cellular eukaryotic mRNAs (3Shatkin A.J. Cell. 1985; 40: 223-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).

Biochem. 1999; 68: 913-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar), and accordingly, its activity is regulated at multiple levels (5Raught B. Gingras A.-C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) transcriptionally via phosphorylation and through the binding of small inhibitory proteins, the eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs). The 4E-BPs specifically inhibit cap-dependent translation initiation by preventing the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G, and thus they prevent ribosome binding to the mRNA (6Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, the 4E-BPs mimic eIF4G and compete for eIF4E binding (6Haghighat A. Mader S.

Cell. 1999; 3: 707-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The binding of the 4E-BPs to eIF4E is regulated by their phosphorylation state. The underphosphorylated forms of 4E-BPs interact with eIF4E, whereas the hyperphosphorylated forms do not (4Gingras A.-C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Annu. Rev.

Upon cell stimulation with serum, growth factors, or hormones, 4E-BPs become phosphorylated on multiple serine/threonine residues and dissociate from eIF4E to relieve translational inhibition (8Gingras A.-C.

To understand this observation, we undertook the characterization of the human EIF4EBP3 genomic locus.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESNorthern Blotting—Human and mouse 4E-BP3 splice variants were analyzed by Northern hybridization using commercial blots (multiple tissue Northern blots MTN1 and MTNM, respectively, Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following DNA fragments were used as probes: mouse 4E-BP3 cDNA, exon 34 of the MASK cDNA (nt 7681-8139), exons B+C of the MASK-BP3ARF cDNA (nt 7829-8265), exon A of the 4E-BP3 cDNA (GenBank accession number AF038869; nt 1-175), exon 0 of the MASK-BP3ARF cDNA (nt 7626-7739), and human β-actin (Clontech).Isolation of Genomic Clones—Phage clones containing the mouse and human 4E-BP3 genes were obtained by screening genomic DNA libraries (human circulating lymphocytes, Stratagene, and mouse 129SvJ, a generous gift from Tak Mak) with the human 4E-BP3 cDNA as a probe.MASK Cloning—The full-length MASK cDNA was cloned by sequential 5′-RACE using a commercial kit (marathon cDNA amplification kit, Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Four GSP oligonucleotides were used: GSP1, 5′-CTC CCC AGC CCT GGT TAG CTG GCA CCT GAC; GSP2, 5′-GGT GGT GGT TGC ACT AGG AGG TTC TAT GGG; GSP3, 5′-GAC TAC CAT CTC CTT CCC CTT CTG GG; and GSP4, 5′-GTC CTC CAC AGG CAG CTA GCG TC. The four RACE products were subcloned together and with ESTs AA465291 and BE622326 to give the full-length human MASK cDNA (GenBank accession number AF521882) and with ESTs T82868 and BE622326 to give the full-length human MASK-BP3ARF cDNA (GenBank accession number AF521883). The cDNAs sequences were confirmed by sequencing.Quantitative RT-PCR—Aliquots (250 ng) from the mouse total RNA master panel (BD Biosciences) or dilutions of the calibrator mouse kidney total RNA (BD Biosciences) were used for quantitative single-step RT-PCR in the LightCycler System using the RNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Diagnostics) as described by the manufacturer. The amplification program consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 30 s followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 s, annealing at 60 °C for 3 s, and extension at 72 °C for 17 s. The amount of fluorescent product was measured at the end of every cycle with a single acquisition at 80 °C for 1 s. Duplicate determinations were made for each sample, and the gene copy number was normalized by the amount of β-actin present in the same sample using the LightCycler Relative Quantification Software (version 1.0; Roche Diagnostics). The following transcript-specific primers were used: m4E-BP3 (ex1 forward, 5′-CAG ACG GCT ACA GCA C-3′; ex3 reverse, 5′-CTG TTC GTC ATC GGT TAT T-3′), mMASK-BP3 (ex33.1 forward, 5′-GGA CTT CAC AAC CCA GA-3′; ex3 reverse, 5′-CTG TTC GTC ATC GGT TAT T-3′), mMASK (ex33.2 forward, 5′-GCT CCC ACT AAC ATT TTT CAC CAG-3′; ex34 reverse, 5′-CCC AGA GTT CTT CCA TAG TCA TAG-3′), and mβ-actin (actin forward, 5′-ACC AAC TGG GAC GAT ATG GAG AAG A-3′; actin reverse, 5′-ACG ACC AGA GGC ATA CAG GGA CAA-3′).Antibodies—Antibody 2275 was raised in a rabbit against a synthetic peptide (CHPMHQQLSDPSTFSQ) comprising amino acids 2423-2437 from MASK exon 32. The peptide (2 mg) was cross-linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and bovine serum albumin using a commercial kit (Imject-activated immunogen conjugation kit, Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-MASK antibodies 2335 and 2336 were raised in rabbits against a GST-MASK fusion (MASK amino acids 2404-2523). Anti-MASK-BP3ARF antibodies 2349 and 2350 were raised in rabbits against a GST-MASK-BP3ARF fusion (MASK-BP3ARF amino acids 2523-2617). Antibodies 2275, 2335, and 2336 recognize both MASK and MASK-BP3ARF. Antibodies 2349 and 2350 specifically recognize MASK-BP3ARF.Cell Culture and Transfections—The prostate cancer cell line LNCaP (21Horoszewicz J.S. Leong S.S. Chu T.M. Wajsman Z.L. Friedman M.

After 6 h, the transfected cells were trypsinized, plated on a 15-cm dish, and grown for 24 h. Cell extracts were prepared by scraping cells in cold Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) and subjecting the suspension to three freeze-thaw cycles. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and the protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay.Immunoprecipitations—For immunoprecipitation experiments, 293T/17 cells (150-mm dish) were lysed 24 h after transfection in 500 μl of cold Nonidet P-40 buffer, and debris was spun down. Total extract (1 mg) was diluted with 2 volumes of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and precleared at 4 °C for 1 h by incubation with protein GSepharose (Amersham Biosciences, 40 μl). The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube together with anti-HA antibody HA.11 (Babco, 5 μg) bound to protein G-Sepharose (40 μl). Incubation with end-over-end rotation was carried out at 4 °C for 2.5 h. Beads were spun down and washed three times with cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The immunoprecipitated material was eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE (6% gel).Immunoblotting—Polypeptides were resolved on SDS-6% polyacrylamide gels and transferred for 16 h at 30 V onto 0.22-μm nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for 24 h with 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST). Membranes were then incubated for 2 h with primary antibodies 2335 (1:1000), 2336 (1:1000), 2349 (1:1000), 2350 (1:1000), and 2275 (1:500) or a monoclonal antibody to HA (HA.11, 1:5000, Babco) all of which were diluted in PBST. Incubation with secondary antibody was performed with peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (1:5000 in PBST, Amersham Biosciences) or with peroxidase-coupled sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin (1:5000 in PBST, Amersham Biosciences). Detection was performed with ECL (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).RESULTSCloning of Human and Mouse 4E-BP3 Gene—In a previous analysis of 4E-BP3 mRNA expression, we observed that the human 4E-BP3 cDNA hybridized with two different messages, a mRNA of ∼800 bp corresponding to the cDNA probe and an unidentified mRNA of ∼8.5 kb (11Poulin F. Gingras A.-C. Olsen H. Chevalier S. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14002-14007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). To determine whether expression of the 8.5-kb variant is conserved in the mouse, we performed a Northern analysis on multiple murine poly(A) RNA using the mouse 4E-BP3 cDNA as a probe (Fig. 1). As anticipated, the 800-bp and 8.5-kb mRNAs were both expressed in the mouse (Fig. 1, lane 7). To better understand the nature of the 8.5-kb mRNA, we isolated the human EIF4EBP3 and mouse Eif4ebp3 genes.The human EIF4EBP3 gene spans 1.9 kb and comprises three exons and two introns (Fig. 2A). Data base searches revealed that human EIF4EBP3 has been assigned to chromosomal location 5q31.3, which was confirmed by sequencing (GenBank™ accession number AC005214). Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the human EIF4EBP3 gene is present as a single copy in each haploid genome (data not shown), which was verified through BLAST searches of the Human Genome sequence database. This analysis also indicated that the EIF4EBP gene family is composed of no more than three expressed genes, EIF4EBP1, EIF4EBP2, and EIF4EBP3. The mouse Eif4ebp3 gene has a structure that is identical to the human gene, but it is 1.7 kb in length. Data base analysis established that Eif4ebp3 is located on mouse chromosome 18, on a DNA fragment that is syntenic with human chromosome 5q31. The sequence of the mouse Eif4ebp3 gene has been released in GenBank™ (accession number AC087795).Fig. 2Structure of the human MASK and EIF4EBP3 loci.A, genomic structure of the EIF4EBP3 locus and the region located immediately upstream. 4E-BP3 mRNA is expressed from this locus (splice variant 1), as are two putative mRNAs (splice variants 2 and 3).

Exons B+C (Fig. 2A) were amplified by PCR and were used to probe a human poly(A) RNA blot (Fig. 3A). This analysis identified an 800-bp and an 8.5-kb message as was observed previously with a full-length cDNA probe (11Poulin F. Gingras A.-C. Olsen H. Chevalier S. Sonenberg N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14002-14007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). A second probe consisting of exon A was used on the same RNA blot (Fig. 3B). In contrast to exons B+C, the exon A probe recognized the 800-bp message but not the 8.5-kb message.Fig. 3Analysis of transcript expression from the human MASK and EIF4EBP3 loci. The expression of transcripts from the EIF4EBP3 locus was analyzed by Northern blotting on 2 μg of poly(A) RNA purified from human tissues. DNA probes derived from the exons illustrated in Fig. 2 were used for the detection of specific transcripts. A, 4E-BP3 and MASK-BP3ARF expression detected by the exons B+C probe.

Data base probing with the sequence of exon A exclusively identified ESTs that were contained within the cDNA of 4E-BP3 (Fig. 2A, EST type 1). In contrast, two categories of ESTs could be detected when the sequence of exons B+C was used as a probe. As with exon A, the first category comprised ESTs contained in the known 4E-BP3 cDNA. The second category, however, consisted of ESTs harboring sequences identical to exons B+C plus some unidentified sequence located at the position where exon A is found in 4E-BP3 cDNA (Fig. 2A, EST type 2). One of these ESTs (GenBank™ accession number T82868) was sequenced. Oligonucleotides were designed from this sequence, and a phage clone containing the EIF4EBP3 gene was sequenced. Two novel putative exons were identified (exons 0 and 33) that are located 5.4 and 8.5 kb upstream of exon A, respectively (Fig. 2A). Data base searches using the sequence of exon 0 failed to reveal any novel splice variants. Searches with the sequence of exon 33, however, exposed a third type of EST that contains a novel putative exon (exon 34) located immediately after exon 33 (Fig. 2A, EST type 3). An EST from the third type (GenBank™ accession number AA465291) was sequenced. Except for exon 34 at the 3′ terminus, it shared all of its upstream sequence with EST T82868. Exons 0 and 34 were amplified and used as probes for a human multiple tissues Northern blot (Fig. 3, C and D, respectively). These analyses revealed messages in which the size and pattern of expression are identical to the 8.5-kb message observed using the EIF4EBP3 exons B+C probe (Fig. 3A).To better characterize the 8.5-kb message, 5′-RACE was performed on poly(A) RNA isolated from LNCaP cells. Four RACE products were successively generated, and they were spliced together, along with ESTs obtained from the IMAGE consortium. Two cDNAs were constructed, the cDNA for splice variant 3 contains exons 33+34 at its 3′ end (Fig. 2A), whereas the cDNA for splice variant 2 contains exons 33+0+B+C (Fig. 2A). The full-length cDNA for splice variant 3 (GenBank™ accession number AF521882) is 8139-bp long and consists of a 5′-UTR of 60 bp, an ORF of 7629 bp, and a 3′-UTR of 450-bp. The 5′-UTR of the cDNA is most probably close to full-length as the size of the mRNA observed in Fig. 3D (8.5 kb) is close to the size of the cDNA (8139 bp), taking into consideration the presence of a poly(A) tail on the mRNA. Moreover, there is an in-frame stop codon located 45 bp upstream from the initiator ATG. The full-length cDNA for splice variant 2 (GenBank™ accession number AF521883) is 8265-bp long and consists of a 5′-UTR of 60 bp that is identical to that of splice variant 3, an ORF of 7854 bp, and a 3′-UTR of 351 bp.Splice Variant 3 Encodes the Human Homologue of Drosophila MASK—The ORF of splice variant 3 encodes a predicted 2542-amino acid protein with a molecular weight of 269,487. The polypeptide contains two identifiable structural motifs, two blocks of ankyrin repeats (10 and 15 repeats) and a KH domain. Although it is shorter, this putative polypeptide is highly similar to the Drosophila melanogaster protein MASK (multiple ankyrin repeats, single KH domain 23). The conservation is especially striking in the regions containing the ankyrin repeats (Fig. 4, A and B) and the KH domain (Fig. 4C). Because of this homology we have named the protein encoded by splice variant 3 human MASK (hMASK).Fig. 4Alignment of hMASK homologous proteins. Regional alignments of hMASK conserved motifs with homologous regions from similar proteins. Black shading denotes identical residues, and gray shading denotes similar residues. The sequences of human MASK, Drosophila MASK, human GTAR, and mouse GTAR have been published in GenBank (accession numbers AF521882, AF425651, NM_032217, and AY026253, respectively). Macaque protein sequence is predicted from a cDNA clone (GenBank accession number AB049837). The sequences of mouse MASK, Anopheles gambiae EAA08897, and C. elegans R11A8.7 are derived from computational analyses of their respective genome sequences.

Simon M.A. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 71-82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), data base searches of GenBank™ define a family of hMASK-related transcripts expressed in several organisms from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans. As expected, the most highly conserved parts of MASK are the ankyrin repeats and the KH domain (Fig. 4). Analysis of the human genome also identified a gene that appears to have arisen from a duplication of MASK. This gene is located on chromosome 4q13.3, and it expresses a transcript that encodes a protein named GTAR (gene trap ankyrin repeat, GenBank™ accession number NM_032217). The human GTAR displays 71% overall homology to hMASK with higher identity in the ankyrin repeats and KH domain regions (Fig. 4).Splice Variant 2 Results from the Fusion of MASK and EIF4EBP3—The gene for hMASK is located on chromosome 5q31.3. It is flanked upstream by the SLC4A9 gene and downstream by the EIF4EBP3 gene. The transcript that we isolated as splice variant 2 (Fig. 2A) results from readthrough transcription of MASK followed by alternative splicing (Fig. 2B). Because splice variant 2 results from the fusion of MASK exons with EIF4EBP3 exons (Fig. 2, A and B), we have named the encoded protein human MASK-BP3 (hMASK-BP3). The hMASK-BP3 ORF encodes a predicted 2617-amino-acid protein with a molecular weight of 277,206. The first 2523 residues are identical to those of hMASK, and they encompass the two blocks of ankyrin repeats as well as the KH domain. The last 94 amino acids result from the translation of exons 0, B, and C. Intriguingly, computer analysis predicts that exons B and C of the MASK-BP3 transcript are translated in a reading frame that differs from that of 4E-BP3 (Fig. 2, C-E). Thus, the second and third exons of the EIF4EBP3 gene potentially encode two different polypeptides. To avoid confusion, the MASK-BP3 protein that we described above will be referred to as MASK-BP3ARF for MASK-4E-BP3 alternate reading frame.4E-BP3, MASK, and MASK-BP3 Are Differentially Expressed in Mouse Tissues—The distribution of m4E-BP3, mMASK, and mMASK-BP3 in multiple mouse tissues was analyzed by real time quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 1B). The relative abundance of the three mRNAs in various tissues was observed to differ substantially. m4E-BP3 is very strongly expressed in the liver with a 10-fold higher expression than in the kidney (Fig. 1B, black bars). Other tissues express variable, and significantly lower, levels of the m4E-BP3 mRNA. This is in contrast to the mMASK mRNA in which expression is more evenly distributed across tissues with slightly higher levels detec"

In an effort to identify proteins that regulate GRK2 function, we searched for interacting proteins by immunoprecipitation of endogenous GRK2 from HL60 cells. Subsequent analysis by gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry revealed that GRK2 associates with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). GRK2 interaction with Hsp90 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and was effectively disrupted by geldanamycin, an Hsp90-specific inhibitor. Interestingly, geldanamycin treatment of HL60 cells decreased the expression of endogenous GRK2 in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and metabolic labeling demonstrated that geldanamycin rapidly accelerated the degradation of newly synthesized GRK2. The use of various protease inhibitors suggested that GRK2 degradation induced by geldanamycin was predominantly through the proteasome pathway. To test whether Hsp90 plays a general role in regulating GRK maturation, additional GRKs were studied by transient expression in COS-1 cells and subsequent treatment with geldanamycin.

Many of these interactions are thought to be important for regulating the localization and enzymatic activity of GRKs. In an effort to identify proteins that interact with endogenous GRKs, here we used immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis and demonstrated that GRK2 interacts with heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90).Hsp90 is a highly conserved protein chaperone that interacts with a diverse group of regulatory and signaling proteins including various protein kinases (25Whitesell L.

For example, Hsp90 can maintain the active state of the serine/threonine kinase Akt by preventing its dephosphorylation (27Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13451-13459Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) functions in protein maturation. Hsp90 contains three functional domains: an N-terminal region that binds ATP, a middle segment that has been implicated in binding client proteins, and a conserved C-terminal region (33Buchner J.

The interaction of Hsp90 with client proteins is dependent on its ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP and can be effectively disrupted by ATP-mimetic drugs including the antibiotics geldanamycin (GA) and herbimycin-A (25Whitesell L.

These antibiotics bind tightly to the Hsp90 ATP/ADP binding pocket often resulting in proteasome-dependent degradation of proteins that require Hsp90 for conformational maturation (35An W.G.

Disruption of GRK2/Hsp90 interaction with geldanamycin resulted in increased degradation of GRK2 mainly through the proteasome pathway. Moreover, additional GRK family members are also regulated by interaction with Hsp90. These studies suggest that heat shock proteins likely play a general role in regulating GRK maturation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—HL60 and COS-1 cells were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Anti-GRK2/3 and anti-GRK4-6 mouse monoclonal antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY) and an anti-GRK2 mouse monoclonal antibody (3A10) was purified from a hybridoma cell culture supernatant. Anti-Hsp90 monoclonal antibodies were from Stressgen Biotechnologies (Victoria, Canada) and Sigma, whereas purified Hsp90 was from Stressgen Biotechnologies. Geldanamycin was from Sigma, and [35S]methionine/cysteine labeling mixture was from Amersham Biosciences. SYPRO ruby protein gel stain was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR), lactacystin and calpeptin were from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), and FuGENE 6™ was from Roche Applied Science.Cell Culture and Transfection—HL60 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and were transfected at a confluence of ∼70% with 1 μg of total DNA/6-cm plate using FuGENE 6™ following the manufacturer's instructions.Immunoprecipitation of GRK2—HL60 cells (∼108) grown in 15-cm plates to a density of ∼2 × 106 cells/ml were harvested by centrifugation, washed two times with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and homogenized with 2 ml of buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 0.1% Triton) using a Brinkman Polytron (14,000 rpm, 2 × 30 s). The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was pre-cleared by incubation with protein G-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was then incubated on a rocker with 20 μl of anti-GRK2/3 or anti-GRK4-6 mAb for 1 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of 100 μl of 50% protein G-agarose pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer and a 1-h incubation at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged, and the pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A and one time with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA on a rocker for 15 min at 4 °C. Bound proteins were eluted by addition of 50 μl of SDS sample buffer followed by boiling for 10 min. Samples were electrophoresed on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Blue or SYPRO ruby stain following the manufacturer's instructions. Stained protein bands were excised from the polyacrylamide gel and stored at -20 °C until further analysis.Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Proteins in polyacrylamide gel slices were digested with 20 ng/μl trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) in 25 mm NH4HCO3 buffer for 16 h at 37 °C. Mass spectra of tryptic peptides were acquired using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization on a hydrophobic H4 chip using a Ciphergen PBS II Instrument (Fremont, CA). Proteins were identified by comparing observed peptide mass fingerprints with those theoretically derived from the NCBInr data base using the Profound data base searching algorithm (Rockefeller University).Immunoblotting—To analyze co-immunoprecipitation of GRK2 and Hsp90, lysates from HL60 or transfected COS-1 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-GRK2/3 mAb as described above, electrophoresed on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted using anti-Hsp90 mAb, horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies, and chemiluminescence (Pierce). To analyze GRK levels in transfected COS-1 cells, cells were homogenized in buffer A and centrifuged, and the supernatants were electrophoresed on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted using anti-GRK2/3 or anti-GRK4-6 mAbs, horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies, and chemiluminescence. Some blots were stripped and reprobed using an α-tubulin mAb (Sigma).Metabolic Labeling—HL60 cells (4 × 107) were harvested and washed two times with 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine and cysteine and then incubated in 10 ml of the same medium with or without 1 μm geldanamycin for 1 h. The cells were then incubated in 4 ml of medium containing 200 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine labeling mixture with or without 1 μm geldanamycin for 30 min (pulse), washed two times with RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and chased with the same medium in the presence of geldanamycin or vehicle for 2-18 h. In an additional series of experiments, geldanamycin was not added until the beginning of the chase period. The cells were then lysed, and GRK2 was immunoprecipitated, electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and detected by fluorography. GRK2 levels were quantified using liquid scintillation counting (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Substrate Phosphorylation—Wild-type GRK2 was overexpressed and purified from Sf9 cells as described in Ref. 37Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Benovic J.L. Receptor. 1993; 3: 39-55PubMed Google Scholar. GRK2 activity was assayed by incubating 22 nm kinase and purified Hsp90 (0, 15, 150, or 1500 nm) with either rod outer segment membranes (4 μm rhodopsin) or tubulin (1 μm) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 4 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (∼1,000 cpm/pmol). Samples were incubated for 5 min (rhodopsin) or 10 min (tubulin) at 30 °C in room light, quenched with SDS buffer, and electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and autoradiographed, and and 32P-labeled proteins were excised and counted to determine pmol of phosphate transferred.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIdentification of Proteins Associated with Endogenous GRK2 in HL60 Cells—GRKs were initially identified via their ability to phosphorylate and regulate the activity of agonist-occupied GPCRs (1Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar, 2Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar). Although GRKs themselves are also subject to numerous regulatory interactions and post-translational modifications (4Penn R.B. Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 5Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), the majority of studies have utilized over-expression or in vitro analysis to analyze these processes. Here we attempted to identify proteins that interact with and potentially regulate the function of endogenous GRKs. The strategy used involved immunoprecipitation of endogenous GRKs from cell lysates followed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. In the present study, we used HL60 cells because they have high endogenous levels of GRK2 (∼170,000 molecules/cell) and GRK6 (∼27,000 molecules/cell) (38Loudon R.P. Perussia B. Benovic J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 4547-4557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An HL60 cell lysate (from ∼108 cells) was incubated with either anti-GRK2/3 monoclonal antibodies that selectively immunoprecipitate GRK2 and -3, or anti-GRK4-6 monoclonal antibodies that immunoprecipitate GRK4, -5, and -6 (39Oppermann M. Diverse-Pierluissi M. Drazner M.H. Dyer S.L. Freedman N.J. Peppel K.C. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7649-7654Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The resulting protein complexes were electrophoresed on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and then stained with Coomassie Blue or SYPRO ruby stain. Protein bands of ∼90, ∼80, and ∼52 kDa were clearly observed in the GRK2/3 immunoprecipitation that were not evident in the GRK4-6 lane (Fig. 1). In contrast, there were no protein bands selectively immunoprecipitated in the GRK4-6 lane. This may reflect the 7-fold lower level of GRK6 compared with GRK2 in HL60 cells (38Loudon R.P. Perussia B. Benovic J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 4547-4557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the lower efficiency of the GRK4-6 antibodies in immunoprecipitation. 2A. Pronin and J. L. Benovic, unpublished observation. The 80-kDa band in the GRK2/3 lane was identified as GRK2 by immunoblotting using an anti-GRK2-specific monoclonal antibody. The 90- and 52-kDa bands were excised from the gel, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The 90-kDa protein was identified as Hsp90-β (19 matching peptides and 31% overall sequence coverage), whereas the 52-kDa protein was a proteolytic fragment of GRK2.To confirm the interaction of Hsp90 and GRK2, we used co-immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. GRK2 from HL60 cells was immunoprecipitated using the anti-GRK2/3 mAb, electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed for Hsp90 using an anti-Hsp90 monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, a 90-kDa band that was slightly larger than the Hsp90 band in the HL60 lysate was specifically detected in the anti-GRK2/3 mAb immunoprecipitation. This band was not detected using Hsp90 antibodies specific for either the α or β isoforms (not shown), suggesting that the ∼90-kDa Hsp90 that co-immunoprecipitates with GRK2 may be a different variant. Indeed, a number of Hsp90 variants have been identified including various polymorphisms of Hsp90-α and -β (40Passarino G. Cavalleri G.L. Stecconi R. Franceschi C. Altomare K. Dato S. Greco V. Luca Cavalli Sforza L. Underhill P.A. de Benedictis G. Hum. Mutat. 2003; 21: 554-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and Hsp90N, a 75-kDa Hsp90 that lacks the ansamycin-binding domain (41Grammatikakis N. Vultur A. Ramana C.V. Siganou A. Schweinfest C.W. Watson D.K. Raptis L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8312-8320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, analysis of the NCBI protein data base reveals a 737-amino acid Hsp90 variant (NCBI accession number T46243) that is 99.6% identical to Hsp90-β over the first 709 residues but contains 13 additional amino acids within a divergent C-terminal tail. It is also possible that the Hsp90 that co-immunoprecipitates with GRK2 is post-translationally modified. However, treatment of the GRK2 immunoprecipitate with alkaline phosphatase did not change the mobility of the Hsp90 band, suggesting that it is not phosphorylated (not shown).Fig. 2Characterization of GRK2/Hsp90 interaction by immunoprecipitation.A, the interaction of GRK2 with Hsp90 was also demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of GRK2 from HL60 cell lysates using anti-GRK2/3 mAb and detection of Hsp90 using an anti-Hsp90 antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” No Hsp90 co-immunoprecipitated with the anti-GRK4-6 mAb (right lane). B, to further verify that Hsp90 co-immunoprecipitated with GRK2, HL60 cells were treated with the Hsp90-specific inhibitor geldanamycin for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were then lysed, immunoprecipitated with anti-GRK2/3 mAb, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (WB) using an anti-Hsp90 mAb. The blot was also stripped and probed for GRK2 using an anti-GRK2 mAb, whereas the lysate was blotted for total Hsp90 and GRK2. IP, immunoprecipitate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Geldanamycin specifically binds to the ATP/ADP pocket of Hsp90 and effectively disrupts Hsp90 interaction with a number of proteins (42Young J.C. Moarefi I. Hartl F.U. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). As further evidence that Hsp90 interacts with GRK2, we incubated HL60 cells with 1 μm geldanamycin for 2 h at 37 °C. Geldanamycin treatment was found to effectively block Hsp90 association with GRK2 as assessed by GRK2 immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2B). Thus, endogenous GRK2 appears to specifically associate with Hsp90 in HL60 cells.Effect of Geldanamycin on the Expression, Maturation, and Degradation of Endogenous GRK2—An in vivo requirement for Hsp90 has been established for steroid hormone receptors (43Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar), various protein kinases such as v-Src, Wee-1, Cdk4, Raf, and Akt (27Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl.

Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar) and calcineurin (48Imai J. Yahara I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9262-9270Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Geldanamycin destabilizes the interaction between Hsp90 and its associated client proteins leading to accelerated degradation and loss of function. To assess the effect of Hsp90 interaction on GRK2 expression, HL60 cells were treated with various concentrations of geldanamycin for 24 h, and GRK2 levels were analyzed by immunoblotting. Geldanamycin induced down-regulation of GRK2 expression in a dose-dependent manner with 50% inhibition observed at ∼0.3 μm and ∼65% lower GRK2 levels at 10 μm geldanamycin (Fig. 3, A and B). This effect was time-dependent with 50% of the maximal reduction in GRK2 levels observed after an ∼8-h treatment with 5 μm geldanamycin (Fig. 3C). The reduction in GRK2 levels suggests that association of GRK2 with Hsp90 is required for GRK2 stability.Fig. 3Inhibition of GRK2 expression in HL60 cells by geldanamycin. HL60 cells were treated with 0, 0.08, 0.4, 2, or 10 μm geldanamycin for 24 h at 37 °C, and total GRK2 levels were then analyzed by Western blotting (WB) using an anti-GRK2 mAb. A, shows a representative immunoblot of GRK2 and α-tubulin expression after geldanamycin treatment. B, shows the relative levels of GRK2 expression from three independent experiments quantified by densitometry. C, shows the time course of geldanamycin treatment. HL60 cells were incubated with 5 μm geldanamycin for 0, 1, 3, 9, or 27 h, harvested, and immunoblotted for total GRK2 and reprobed for α-tubulin as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)One important function for Hsp90 is to catalyze the proper folding of newly synthesized client proteins. In the absence of Hsp90 action, the protein may be subject to rapid degradation. Thus, a decline in the steady state level of GRK2 following geldanamycin treatment could result from changes in the rate of GRK2 synthesis and/or degradation. To characterize these processes, HL60 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 30 min to label newly synthesized proteins, chased for 0, 2, 6, or 18 h with complete medium, and then analyzed for GRK2 levels by immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and autoradiography.To assess whether disrupting Hsp90/GRK2 interaction affects de novo GRK2 synthesis, geldanamycin was present during the entire pulse and chase periods (GA-1), whereas to assess whether Hsp90 affects GRK2 degradation, geldanamycin was present only during the chase period (GA-2). The half-life of GRK2 in HL60 cells in the absence of geldanamycin treatment was ∼20 h (Fig. 4), similar to our previous studies that reported a half-life of 24 h in HL60 cells (38Loudon R.P. Perussia B. Benovic J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 4547-4557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When geldanamycin was present only during the chase period, the half-life of GRK2 was decreased to ∼12 h, suggesting that Hsp90 interaction with GRK2 has a relatively modest stabilizing effect on the rate of GRK2 degradation (Fig. 4). In contrast, when geldanamycin was present during the pulse and chase periods, there was a dramatic increase in the rate of GRK2 degradation, with the half-life of GRK2 decreasing to <2 h (Fig. 4). In addition, although a single protein band of ∼80 kDa was observed in the untreated and GA-2 samples, multiple protein bands were observed in the GA-1 samples. Our data also showed that degradation of GRK2 was mainly accelerated at the early chase times (Fig. 4B), suggesting that disruption of Hsp90 interaction during the synthesis of GRK2 results in proteolytic degradation of GRK2. Thus, the interaction of GRK2 and Hsp90 appears to inhibit proteolytic degradation of newly synthesized GRK2 and likely aids in GRK2 folding and maturation. It is interesting that the half-life for newly synthesized GRK2 in geldanamycin-treated HL60 cells (<2 h) is similar to the ∼1-h half-life reported by Penela et al. (11Penela P. Elorza A. Sarnago S. Mayor Jr., F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5129-5138Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 49Penela P. Ruiz-Gomez A. Castano J.G. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol.

This may reflect differences in co- and/or post-translational processes between these cell types, or it might suggest that Hsp90 interaction with GRK2 is lacking in some cells.Fig. 4Pulse-chase analysis of GRK2 expression in HL60 cells.A, HL60 cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with medium containing [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine and then chased with nonradioactive medium for the indicated time.

HIP-55 binds to actin filaments both in vitro and in vivo. HIP-55 activates HPK1 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which are two important lymphocyte signaling molecules. Until now, the regulation and function of HIP-55 in T cell receptor (TCR) signaling were unknown. We found that HIP-55 was recruited to glycolipid-enriched microdomains upon TCR stimulation, which indicates that HIP-55 is regulated by TCR signaling. HIP-55 interacted with ZAP-70, a critical protein-tyrosine kinase in TCR signaling, and this interaction was induced by TCR signaling. ZAP-70 phosphorylated HIP-55 at Tyr-334 and Tyr-344 in vitro and in vivo, and the HIP-55 mutant (Y334F/Y344F) was not tyrosine-phosphorylated in stimulated T cells. To study its function in T cell activation, HIP-55-deficient Jurkat T cells were established using the RNA interference approach. In the HIP-55-deficient cells, TCR (but not UV)-stimulated JNK activation was decreased. Furthermore, the activation of HPK1, a known JNK upstream activator and HIP-55-interacting protein, was also decreased in the HIP-55-deficient cells.

Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 197-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Engagement of the TCR triggers a cascade of signaling events. First, it initiates the phosphorylation of TCR-associated CD3 by the Src family protein-tyrosine kinases, Lck and Fyn, which subsequently activates another protein-tyrosine kinase, ZAP-70 (70-kDa zeta-associated protein) (2Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Then the activated protein-tyrosine kinases transmit the TCR signals to the downstream molecules, including LAT, phospholipase Cγ, and SLP-76. LAT is localized in specific plasma membrane compartments known as glycolipid-enriched microdomains (GEMs), where the phosphorylated form of LAT acts as a docking protein for several adaptor proteins, including Gads and Grb2 (3Zhang W. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1998; 9: 239-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 4Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The LAT-associated adaptors further recruit various signaling molecules to the GEMs, which are activated within GEMs. Thus, TCR signaling leads to multiple downstream signaling events, such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation, ERK activation, the release of intracellular Ca2+, and increased interleukin-2 production.

JNK activation is an important downstream event after TCR stimulation. The JNK family belongs to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily, which also comprises the ERK and p38 families (5Chen Y.-R. Tan T.-H. Int. J. Oncol. 2000; 16: 651-662PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of MAPKs goes through a conserved signaling cascade: MAPK kinases, MAPK kinase kinases, and sometimes MAPK kinase kinase kinases (6Chen Y.-R. Tan T.-H. Gene Ther. Mol. Biol. 1999; 4: 83-98Google Scholar). In T cells, JNK is implicated in the integration of TCR and CD28 signals, which is required for T cell activation and interleukin-2 production (7Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both ERK and JNK activities are significantly reduced during T cell anergy (8Li W. Whaley C.D. Mondino A. Mueller D.L. Science. 1996; 271: 1272-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). The JNK signaling cascade has also been shown to regulate the stabilization of interleukin-2 mRNA through its 5′-untranslated region (9Chen C.Y. Del Gatto-Konczak F. Wu Z. Karin M. Science. 1998; 280: 1945-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Studies from jnk1-null and jnk2-null mice indicate that both JNK1 and JNK2 are required for the differentiation of CD4+ T cells into effector Th1 cells (10Dong C. Yang D.D. Wysk M. Whitmarsh A.J.

Thus, the collective evidence suggests that HIP-55 may be involved in T lymphocyte signaling. Until now, the role of HIP-55 in TCR signaling was unclear. In this paper, we found that HIP-55 translocated into GEMs upon TCR stimulation. ZAP-70 interacted with and phosphorylated HIP-55 at tyrosine 334 and 344. Furthermore, we established HIP-55-deficient Jurkat T cells using the RNA interference approach. In the HIP-55-deficient T cells, JNK activation upon TCR stimulation, but not UV irradiation, was partially defective. In contrast, ERK activation by TCR stimulation was unaffected in HIP-55-deficient T cells. Moreover, the activation of HPK1, a known JNK upstream activator, was also decreased in the HIP-55-deficient cells. Our results reveal the regulation of HIP-55 during TCR signaling, and using a genetic approach, our data show for the first time that HIP-55 plays a functional role in TCR signaling. Cell Culture and Stimulation—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were maintained and transfected as previously described (22Ling P. Yao Z. Meyer C.F. Wang X.S. Oehl W. Feller S.M. Tan T.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Jurkat T cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. For T cell stimulation, Jurkat cells were resuspended in ice-cold RPMI medium without fetal calf serum and then mixed with anti-CD3 antibody (OKT3, 3 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 10 min. Rabbit anti-mouse antibodies (3 μg/ml) were added and mixed for another 10 min at 4 °C to cross-link the primary antibody. The cells were then placed in a 37 °C water bath to allow stimulation and harvested at the indicated time points. For 6 mm pervanadate preparation, 20 μl of 100 mm Na3VO4, 33 μl of 30% H2O2, and 80 μl of H2O were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The cells were lysed by Triton X-100 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, freshly supplemented with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 3 μg/ml aprotinin). Antibodies—The anti-HIP-55 antibody (Ab571), anti-JNK antibody (Ab102), and anti-HPK1 (Ab484) were described previously (16Ensenat D. Yao Z. Wang X.S. Kori R. Zhou G. Lee S.C. Tan T.-H. J. Biol.

The anti-CD3 mAb (OKT3) was purified from hybridoma supernatants on a protein G affinity column using standard protocols. The anti-ZAP-70 mAb was purchased from BD Transduction Lab (San Diego, CA). The anti-LAT antibody and anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (4G10) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-c-Myc (9E10), anti-ERK2 (C-14), and anti-Lck (3A5) mAbs were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The anti-FLAG mAb (M2) was purchased from Sigma. The anti-HA mAb (12C5) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. The anti-His5 mAb was purchased from Qiagen. Plasmids and Transfections—The FLAG-tagged HIP-55, FLAG-tagged HIP-55 (Y334F/Y344F) mutants, HA-tagged HIP-55 (Y334F), HA-tagged HIP-55 (Y344F), HA-tagged SH3 mutant HIP-55 (W408K), and His-tagged HIP-55 (amino acids 1–144, 145–299, and 300–431) were cloned into mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1-TOPO. Myc-tagged ZAP-70 and Lck constructs were gifts from Dr. R. L. Wange (National Institute of Aging, NIH, Baltimore, MD). For glutathione S-transferase (GST)-HIP-55 protein construction, HIP-55, HIP-55 (145–365), and HIP-55 (360–433) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pGEX4T-3 vector. The pSUPER siRNA vector was a gift from Dr. R. Agami (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, Netherlands) and has been previously described (24Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar). To generate pSUPER-HIP-55 siRNA construct, a 19-nucleotide sequence selected from HIP-55 cDNA was annealed and ligated into pSUPER vector at BglII and HindIII enzyme sites. To generate pSUPER.puro and pSUPERHIP-55.puro constructs, a puromycin-resistant cassette was cut by XbaI and BamHI from pBabe-puro vector and ligated into the pSUPER and pSUPER-HIP-55, respectively. The Jurkat T cells transfection was performed by electroporation as previously described (14Ling P. Meyer C.F. Redmond L.P. Shui J.-W. Davis B. Rich R.R. Hu M.-C.-T. Wange R.L. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18908-18914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For transient transfections, Jurkat TAg T cells were transfected by electroporation and were stimulated, 40 h after transfection, by anti-CD3 treatment to induce TCR signaling. To establish stably transfected Jurkat cells, 2 days after electroporation with pSUPER.puro and pSUPER-HIP-55.puro, 1 mg/ml G418 or 1 μg/ml puromycin was added to the culture medium. After 1 month, drug-resistant clones were isolated by limiting dilution, and the protein levels of HIP-55 in these clones were determined by Western blot analysis. GEM Fractionation—GEM fractions preparation was previously described (25Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Briefly, Jurkat T cells (5 × 107) were either unstimulated or stimulated with an anti-CD3 mAb (OKT3, 10 μg/ml) cross-linked by a rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (5 μg/ml) for 2 min. The cells were collected and lysed in 1 ml of 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer. The cell lysates were well mixed with 1 ml of 80% sucrose and then transferred to ultracentrifuge tubes. These mixtures were overlaid with 2 ml of 30% sucrose and 1 ml of 5% sucrose sequentially and then subjected to ultracentrifugation for 16 h at 4 °C. Twelve fractions (0.4 ml/fraction) were collected from the top to the bottom of the sucrose gradient. The first nine fractions were subjected to immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—The cells were lysed in lysis buffer. The cell lysate was incubated with indicated antibodies and protein G-Sepharose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were washed four times with lysis buffer and then the immunocomplexes were subjected to Western blotting. For Western blot analysis, immunocomplexes or cellular proteins (50–100 μg) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and then the gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 4 °C. Western blotting was performed as previously described using indicated antibodies (16Ensenat D. Yao Z. Wang X.S. Kori R. Zhou G. Lee S.C. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33945-33950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Immunocomplex Kinase Assays—JNK, ZAP-70, ERK, and HPK1 immunocomplex kinase assays were performed as previously described (12Hu M.-C.-T. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F. Tan T.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2251-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). GST-c-Jun was used as a substrate for JNK kinase assay, GSTHIP-55 and its truncated forms were used as substrates for ZAP-70 kinase assay, and myelin basic protein was used for ERK and HPK1 kinase assays. HIP-55 Translocates into GEMs upon TCR Stimulation—It is known that GEMs are important lipid microdomains for TCR signaling (4Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 25Zhang W. Sloan-Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Many critical signaling molecules are constitutively enriched in or recruited to the GEMs upon TCR signaling. Disruption of GEMs leads to the down-regulation of TCR signaling. To determine whether HIP-55 is involved in TCR signaling, we examined whether HIP-55 resides in or translocates to GEMs upon TCR stimulation. Our results showed that HIP-55 was barely detectable in the GEMs in resting Jurkat T cells; however, upon TCR stimulation, a significant portion of the HIP-55 translocated into GEMs (Fig. 1). LAT, a known protein localized to the GEMs, was used as a control to show the location of GEMs in the cell fractions. This result indicates that HIP-55 is recruited to GEMs upon TCR stimulation, suggesting that HIP-55 is involved in TCR signaling. HIP-55 Interacts with ZAP-70 —Lck and ZAP-70 are two important tyrosine kinases in TCR signaling, and their activation is an early event in TCR signaling (2Kane L.P. Lin J. Weiss A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). After the activation of Lck and ZAP-70 by TCR signaling, they phosphorylate the downstream signaling molecules, including LAT, SLP-76, and phospholipase Cγ1. Because HIP-55 may be involved in TCR signaling, it is possible that HIP-55 can interact with Lck or ZAP-70. To examine the interaction between HIP-55 and Lck or ZAP-70, FLAG-tagged HIP-55 was co-transfected into HEK293T cells with Myc-tagged ZAP-70, Lck, or both. HIP-55 was then immunoprecipitated, and its association with ZAP-70 or Lck was examined by Western blotting. From the anti-HIP-55 immunoprecipitates, we detected the associated ZAP-70 (Fig. 2A). In a reciprocal experiment, HIP-55 was also found in the anti-ZAP-70 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that HIP-55 may form a complex with ZAP-70 in vivo. We did not detect any significant interaction between HIP-55 and Lck (data not shown). To study the interaction between endogenous ZAP-70 and HIP-55 during TCR signaling, we stimulated Jurkat cells with an anti-CD3 antibody, then immunoprecipitated HIP-55, and examined the associated ZAP-70. We found that there was a weak basal interaction between endogenous ZAP-70 and HIP-55 and that this interaction was greatly enhanced upon TCR stimulation (Fig. 2C). This finding was consistent with the results of the overexpression system, which showed that the activated form of ZAP-70 strongly interacted with HIP-55 as evidenced by the interaction between HIP-55 and ZAP-70 after ZAP-70 was activated by co-transfection with Lck (Fig. 2, A and B). The results from both the HEK293T and Jurkat T cells indicate that HIP-55 interacts with activated ZAP-70. To map the region of HIP-55 responsible for its interaction with ZAP-70, the SH3 domain mutant and three truncated forms of HIP-55 (amino acids 1–144, 145–299, and 300–431) were examined for binding to ZAP-70. The mutant and the truncated forms of HIP-55 were transfected with ZAP-70 and Lck, and then the ZAP-70 immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted to detect any associated HIP-55. We found that the SH3 domain mutant of HIP-55 still bound to active ZAP-70; however, all three truncated forms of HIP-55 failed to bind to ZAP-70, although they were detectable by Western blotting in cell lysates (Fig. 2D). Our results show that the tyrosine mutant (Fig. 2, A and B) and SH3 domain mutant (Fig. 2D) of HIP-55 are still able to bind to ZAP-70, but no truncated forms of HIP-55 (the N terminus, C terminus, or middle part) can bind to ZAP-70. Thus, it is likely that multiple regions of HIP-55 are required for its interaction with ZAP-70. It is noted that there is a difference between the predicted and apparent molecular weights for the three truncated forms of HIP-55. It is likely that the three truncated forms of HIP-55 have different structural conformations, which causes the difference between the predicted and apparent molecular weights. HIP-55 Is Tyrosine-phosphorylated by ZAP-70 at Tyr-334 and Tyr-344 in Vitro and in Vivo—To investigate the functional relevance of the interaction between HIP-55 and ZAP-70, we examined the ability of ZAP-70 to phosphorylate HIP-55 both in vitro and in vivo. We immunoprecipitated Myc-tagged ZAP-70 from transfected HEK293T cells and used purified GST-HIP-55 as a substrate for a ZAP-70 in vitro kinase assay. HIP-55 was phosphorylated after incubation with ZAP-70, which was activated by co-transfection with Lck (Fig. 3A, left panel). We also found that transfected ZAP-70 alone weakly phosphorylated HIP-55 in vitro (Fig. 3A, left panel), and this may be due to the weak activation of ZAP-70 induced by autophosphorylation in the overexpression system; activated/phosphorylated ZAP-70 was detected as the upper band of the ZAP-70 doublet bands by Western blotting (Fig. 2B). To map the phosphorylation sites of HIP-55 by ZAP-70, several truncated GST-HIP-55 constructs were generated and examined as substrates in an in vitro ZAP-70 kinase assay. We found that only HIP-55 (145–365) could be phosphorylated by ZAP-70 in vitro (Fig. 3A, left panel), although by Coomassie Blue staining, all of the GST fusion proteins were expressed (Fig. 3A, right panel). This indicates that the potential phosphorylation sites may lie within amino acids 145–365 of HIP-55. Within the amino acids 145–365 of HIP-55, there are two tyrosine residues, Tyr-334 and Tyr-344, followed by two proline residues at the Y+3 and Y+4 positions, which are consensus phosphorylation motifs for tyrosine kinases (17Larbolette O. Wollscheid B. Schweikert J. Nielsen P.J. Wienands J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To test whether these two residues are possible phosphorylation targets of ZAP-70, we generated HIP-55 mutants, which carry either single or double tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation at residues 334 and 344. After co-transfection with ZAP-70 and Lck in HEK293T cells, both the wild-type and mutant HIP-55 were immunoprecipitated and examined by Western blotting using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. We found that a single mutation at Tyr-334 or Tyr-344 decreased the phosphorylation levels of HIP-55 by ZAP-70, and mutation of both sites abolished the phosphorylation of HIP-55 by ZAP-70 (Fig. 3, B and C). These results indicate that HIP-55 is tyrosine-phosphorylated by ZAP-70 at Tyr-334 and Tyr-344. To further investigate the tyrosine phosphorylation of HIP-55 in T cells, FLAG-HIP-55 and FLAG-HIP-55-FF (Y334F/Y344F mutant) stably transfected Jurkat T cells were established. Transfected HIP-55 protein levels were examined by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG antibody. Both wild-type and mutant HIP-55 were expressed in these stably transfected Jurkat clones (Fig. 4A). To confirm the tyrosine phosphorylation sites of HIP-55 in T cells, these two stably transfected Jurkat clones were treated with pervanadate, which is a potent phosphatase inhibitor. After stimulation, the transfected wild-type and mutant HIP-55 were immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody and examined by Western blotting using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Phosphorylation was found in the wild-type HIP-55 transfected T cells but not in the FLAG-HIP-55-FF (Y334F/Y344F) mutant transfected cells or untransfected Jurkat cells (Fig. 4B). In summary, this result indicates that HIP-55 is phosphorylated on Tyr-334 and Tyr-344 in the stimulated Jurkat T cells. JNK Activation Induced by TCR Signaling Is Defective in HIP-55-deficient Jurkat T Cells—To further study the function of HIP-55 in TCR signaling, we used the RNA interference approach (24Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3968) Google Scholar) to stably knock down HIP-55 protein expression in Jurkat T cells. A HIP-55 siRNA construct was generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The empty vector or HIP-55 siRNA vector was transfected into Jurkat T cells by electroporation, and transfected cells were selected with puromycin for 4 weeks. In the puromycin-resistant mixed population, the protein level of HIP-55 was reduced (Fig. 5A, left panel). Then the puromycin-resistant single clones were established by the limiting dilution method. HIP-55 protein levels were examined by Western blotting in the parental, empty vector-transfected, and HIP-55 siRNA-transfected Jurkat T cells. As expected, HIP-55 expression was significantly reduced in Jurkat cells stably transfected with HIP-55 siRNA. HIP-55 levels in HIP-55 siRNA-transfected cells were reduced by 80–90% as compared with the levels in the vector-transfected or parental cells (Fig. 5A, right panel). Western blotting was performed using an anti-γ-tubulin antibody as a control to show equal loading (Fig. 5A, right panel). The expression levels of other molecules involved in the TCR signaling were also examined by Western blotting. We found that the protein levels of Lck, HPK1, and LAT were not affected in two independent HIP-55-deficient clones (Fig. 5B), indicating that the RNA interference effects are specific. HIP-55 was shown to activate JNK in an overexpression system (16Ensenat D. Yao Z. Wang X.S. Kori R. Zhou G. Lee S.C. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33945-33950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), but its effect on JNK in physiological conditions was not clear. JNK is activated upon TCR stimulation, and this activation is an important event for T cell activation and cytokine production. To determine whether HIP-55 affects the downstream events of TCR signaling, JNK activation was studied in the empty vector-transfected and HIP-55 siRNA-transfected Jurkat T cells. HA-JNK and HIP-55 siRNA were transiently co-transfected into Jurkat TAg T cells. The transfected T cells were stimulated by anti-CD3 treatment. HA-JNK was immunoprecipitated from cell lysate, and its activity was examined by in vitro kinase assays with GST-c-Jun as a substrate. After TCR stimulation, JNK kinase activity was induced. When HIP-55 siRNA was co-transfected, endogenous HIP-55 was knocked down in the transfected cells, and the induction of JNK kinase activity significantly decreased (Fig. 6A); however, the protein level of JNK was not affected (Fig. 6A). In addition to the examination of transfected JNK in the co-transfection system (Fig. 6A), the activation of endogenous JNK induced by TCR stimulation was also investigated in the HIP-55-deficient Jurkat T cells. After TCR stimulation, endogenous JNK was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate, and GST-c-Jun was used as a substrate for in vitro kinase assays. Compared with the vector-transfected cells, we found that JNK activation induced by TCR signaling was partially abolished in two HIP-55 siRNA stably transfected Jurkat clones, as well as in the mixed population of HIP-55 siRNA stably transfected Jurkat cells (Fig. 6B). In contrast, when the HIP-55 siRNA-transfected Jurkat cells were treated with UV, JNK was still activated to comparable levels as in the vector-transfected cells (Fig. 6C), which indicates that JNK can still be activated by other stimuli in HIP-55-deficient Jurkat cells. Moreover, we observed that ERK activation in response to TCR stimulation was not affected in HIP-55-deficient Jurkat T cells (Fig. 6D). Our results suggest that HIP-55 is an important adaptor for JNK activation in TCR signaling. HPK1 Activation Induced by TCR Stimulation Is Defective in HIP-55-deficient Jurkat T Cells—HPK1 is an upstream kinase of JNK in the kinase cascade and is activated upon TCR stimulation (22Ling P. Yao Z. Meyer C.F. Wang X.S. Oehl W. Feller S.M. Tan T.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). HIP-55 interacts with and activates HPK1 in an overexpression system (16Ensenat D. Yao Z. Wang X.S. Kori R. Zhou G. Lee S.C. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33945-33950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); therefore, HIP-55 may regulate HPK1 during TCR signaling. We examined the activation of HPK1 in HIP-55-deficient Jurkat T cells stably transfected with HIP-55 siRNA. After the T cells were stimulated with an anti-CD3 antibody, HPK1 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-HPK1 antibody, and its activation was examined using HPK1 immunocomplex kinase assay. We observed that HPK1 was activated in the vector-transfected Jurkat cells upon TCR stimulation. However, the activation of HPK1 was decreased in the HIP-55-deficient Jurkat T cells (Fig. 7A). In contrast, the induction of HPK1 kinase activity upon pervanadate treatment was not affected in the HIP-55-deficient cells (Fig. 7B). Our result suggests that HIP-55 plays a role in HPK1 activation induced by TCR signaling. HIP-55 is a novel SH3 domain-containing adaptor protein that was proposed to be involved in lymphocyte receptor signaling (16Ensenat D. Yao Z. Wang X.S. Kori R. Zhou G. Lee S.C. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33945-33950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 17Larbolette O. Wollscheid B. Schweikert J. Nielsen P.J. Wienands J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, it was unclear whether and how HIP-55 is involved in TCR signaling. We investigated the involvement of HIP-55 in T cell signaling and found that upon TCR stimulation, HIP-55 was recruited to GEMs. We found an interaction between the tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 and HIP-55, which was induced by TCR stimulation. ZAP-70 phosphorylated HIP-55 at Tyr-334 and Tyr-344, which were shown to be the tyrosine phosphorylation sites of HIP-55 in stimulated T cells. When we stably knocked down HIP-55 expression in Jurkat T cells using the RNA interference approach, JNK activation induced by TCR stimulation, but not UV irradiation, was partially abolished. In contrast, TCR-induced ERK activation was not affected in HIP-55-deficient Jurkat T cells. Furthermore, the activation of HPK1, a known JNK upstream activator, was also decreased in the HIP-55-deficient Jurkat cells. Our results demonstrate for the first time that HIP-55 is an important adaptor protein for the JNK kinase cascade in TCR signaling. GEMs are microdomains critical for TCR signaling. Many important molecules are recruited or constitutively localized to GEMs. The disruption of GEMs decreases the TCR signaling (4Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 26Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Burshtyn D.N. Stebbins C.C. DeJarnette J.B. Trible R.P. Grinberg A. Tsay H.C. Jacobs H.M. Kessler C.M. Long E.O. Love P.E. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1999; 10: 323-332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). HIP-55 was also recruited to GEMs upon TCR stimulation, suggesting that HIP-55 plays a role in TCR signaling. We demonstrated that the activated form of ZAP-70 interacted with and phosphorylated HIP-55 in vitro and in vivo. The interaction sites between ZAP-70 and HIP-55 are unclear; although there are two SH2 domains in ZAP-70, the HIP-55 (Y334F/Y344F) mutant still interacted with ZAP-70 (Fig. 2A), suggesting that these two tyrosine residues are not critical for the binding. We found that the SH3 mutant of HIP-55 was still able to bind to ZAP-70. However, we did not detect any interaction between ZAP-70 and three truncated forms of HIP-55 (the N terminus, the C terminus, and the middle region). It is likely that multiple regions of HIP-55 may regulate its interaction with ZAP-70. Tyr-334 and Tyr-344 of HIP-55, which are phosphorylated by ZAP-70, are conserved among some HIP-55 related molecules. HS1, another actin-binding protein, also contains two of the conserved tyrosine phosphorylation sites targeted by Syk (27Yamanashi Y. Fukuda T. Nishizumi H. Inazu T. Higashi K. Kitamura D. Ishida T. Yamamura H. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1387-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 28Yamanashi Y. Okada M. Semba T. Yamori T. Umemori H. Tsunasawa S. Toyoshima K. Kitamura D. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3631-3635Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These two tyrosine residues within HS1 are critical for B cell receptor-induced apoptosis (27Yamanashi Y. Fukuda T. Nishizumi H. Inazu T. Higashi K. Kitamura D. Ishida T. Yamamura H. Watanabe T. Yamamoto T. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1387-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which may provide insight about the potential function of HIP-55 in TCR signaling. Cortactin is another actin-binding protein that can also be tyrosine-phosphorylated by the Src family kinases. The tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin by Src kinases inhibits its actin cross-linking activity in vitro (29Huang C. Ni Y. Wang T. Gao Y. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13911-13915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to investigate whether HIP-55 has a similar regulatory mechanism to control the cytoskeleton reorganization upon TCR stimulation. When overexpressed, HIP-55 activates JNK in HEK293 cells (16Ensenat D. Yao Z. Wang X.S. Kori R. Zhou G. Lee S.C. Tan T.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33945-33950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); however, it was unclear whether HIP-55 was involved in the JNK activation pathway under physiological conditions. Our data show that JNK activation induced by TCR stimulation was decreased in the HIP-55 knockdown T cells, suggesting that HIP-55 is an important adaptor for the JNK cascade in TCR signaling. However, the underlying mechanism by which HIP-55 regulates JNK activation induced by TCR stimulation remains unclear. We found that HPK1 activation induced by TCR signaling was also affected by HIP-55 deficiency. Potentially, HIP-55 may facilitate the activation of HPK1 or other upstream kinases, which in turn activate the JNK cascade. It is also possible that HIP-55 functions through ZAP-70 to affect downstream events in TCR signaling. We only observed partial defects in JNK activation; this may be because only 80–90% of the HIP-55 was knocked down by HIP-55 siRNA, and the remaining HIP-55 could still partially activate JNK, but we cannot exclude the possibility that there are other alternate pathways that could activate JNK, independent of HIP-55, in TCR signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2017830053,"In a previous study (Shin, E. Y., Shin, K. S., Lee, C. S., Woo, K. N., Quan, S. H., Soung, N. K., Kim, Y. G., Cha, C. I., Kim, S. R., Park, D., Bokoch, G. M., and Kim, E. G. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 44417–44430) we reported that phosphorylation of p85 βPIX, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for Rac1/Cdc42, is a signal for translocation of the PIX complex to neuronal growth cones and is associated with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-induced neurite outgrowth. However, the issue of whether p85 βPIX phosphorylation affects GEF activity on Rac1/Cdc42 is yet to be explored. Here we show that Rac1 activation occurs in a p85 βPIX phosphorylation-dependent manner. A GST-PBD binding assay reveals that Rac1 is activated in a dose- and time-dependent manner in PC12 cells in response to bFGF. Inhibition of ERK or PAK2, the kinases upstream of p85 βPIX in the bFGF signaling, prevents Rac1 activation, suggesting that phosphorylation of p85 βPIX functions upstream of Rac1 activation. To directly address this issue, transfection studies with wild-type and mutant p85 βPIX (S525A/T526A, a non-phosphorylatable form) were performed. Expression of mutant PIX markedly inhibits both bFGF- and nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced activation of Rac1, indicating that phosphorylation of p85 βPIX is responsible for activation of this G protein. Both wild-type and mutant p85 βPIX displaying negative GEF activity (L238R/L239S) are similarly recruited to growth cones, suggesting that Rac1 activation is not essential for translocation of the PIX complex (PAK2-p85 βPIX-Rac1). However, expression of mutant p85 βPIX (L238R/L239S) results in retraction of the pre-existing neurites. Our results provide evidence that bFGF- and NGF-induced phosphorylation of p85 βPIX mediates Rac1 activation, which in turn regulates cytoskeletal reorganization at growth cones, but not translocation of the PIX complex. In a previous study (Shin, E. Y., Shin, K. S., Lee, C. S., Woo, K. N., Quan, S. H., Soung, N. K., Kim, Y. G., Cha, C. I., Kim, S. R., Park, D., Bokoch, G. M., and Kim, E. G. (2002) J. Biol.

Our results provide evidence that bFGF- and NGF-induced phosphorylation of p85 βPIX mediates Rac1 activation, which in turn regulates cytoskeletal reorganization at growth cones, but not translocation of the PIX complex. The dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton is regulated by Rho family G proteins. To date, the most extensively characterized members of this family include Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA (1.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5219) Google Scholar). It is well established that in fibroblast cells, Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA induce formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffle, and filopodia and stress fiber, respectively (2.Hall A. Paterson H.F. Adamson P. Ridley A.J. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond B Biol. Sci. 1993; 340: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These G proteins regulate cytoskeletal rearrangement in a similar fashion in neuronal cells such as PC12, a model system in which the molecular mechanism of neurite outgrowth has been extensively investigated. However, their activation at neuronal growth cones exerts opposing effects on neurite outgrowth. Specifically, RhoA promotes growth cone collapse resulting in neurite retraction, whereas Rac1 and Cdc42 stimulate neurite outgrowth through the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, respectively (3.Luo L. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Along the same lines expression of dominant-negative Rac1 or Cdc42 blocks nerve growth factor (NGF) 1The abbreviations used are: NGF, nerve growth factor; FBS, fetal bovine serum; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; DH, Dbl homology domain; PH, pleckstrin homology domain; SH3, Src homology domain 3; PXXP, proline-rich domain; GBD, GIT1-binding domain; LZ, leucine-zipper domain; PI3-K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.-induced neurite extension (4.Altun-Gultekin Z.F.

Interconversion between these two forms is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEF), GTPase-activating proteins (GAP), and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDI). GEFs of the Dbl family stimulate activation of Rho GTPases by catalyzing GDP/GTP exchange of these G proteins (5.Schmidt A. Hall A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1587-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 6.Zheng Y. Trends Biochem.

Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). All members of this family contain the Dbl homology (DH) domain, which is responsible for catalytic activity. GEF proteins are activated in various ways, including phosphorylation by protein kinases (6.Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 7.Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Considerable evidence shows that p85 βPIX, a member of Dbl family GEF, is phosphorylated in response to extracellular stimuli (9.Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 44417-44430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, the issue of whether this phosphorylation is associated with Rac1/Cdc42 activation remains to be resolved. p85 βPIX functions as a specific GEF for Rac1/Cdc42, both in vitro and in vivo (9.Manser E.

The protein interacts with p21-activated kinase (PAK) and a group of multidomain proteins displaying Arf-GAP activity, specifically, Cat-1/Git1 (12.Bagrodia S. Bailey D. Lenard Z. Hart M. Guan J.L.

Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), and p95-APP1 (14.Di Cesare A. Paris S. Albertinazzi C. Dariozzi S. Andersen J. Mann M. Longhi R. de Curtis I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), through its SH3 and Git-binding domains (GBD), respectively. The LZ domain of p85 βPIX facilitates dimer formation (15.Kim S. Lee S.H. Park D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10581-10584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic analysis of the isolated DH domain suggests that Rac1 is also a component of the p85 βPIX complex (16.Aghazadeh B. Zhu K. Kubiseski T.J. Liu G.A. Pawson T. Zheng Y. Rosen M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1098-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It seems thus likely that p85 βPIX makes a huge complex interacting with PAK2, p95 family member (presumably p95PKL in PC12 cells) and Rac1. Rac1 is considered a critical regulator in the membrane translocation of cellular complexes in a wide range of processes. Integrin-induced recruitment of the PAK-PIX-PKL complex to focal adhesion for proper cell adhesion (17.Brown M.C. West K.A. Turner C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1550-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) or targeting of the complex for cell migration (18.Manabe R.R. Kovalenko M. Webb D.J. Horwitz A.R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1497-1510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is dependent on Rac1/Cdc42 activation. Rac1 is additionally a component of the NADPH oxidase complex, and its activity is required for the translocation of cytosolic oxidase subunits as well as NADPH oxidase activation (19.Dinauer M.C. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2003; 10: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the issue of whether Rac1 activity is essential for targeting the multimeric p85 βPIX complex (p85 βPIX-PAK2-p95PKL-Rac1) in response to bFGF or NGF for neurite outgrowth remains to be determined. In a previous study, we reported that bFGF, a potent stimulator of neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, induces phosphorylation of p85 βPIX via the Ras/ERK/PAK2 pathway and that its translocation to growth cones is dependent on phosphorylation (11.Shin E.Y. Shin K.S. Lee C.S. Woo K.N. Quan S.H. Soung N.K. Kim Y.G. Cha C.I. Kim S.R. Park D. Bokoch G.M. Kim E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44417-44430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Since one of the activation mechanisms of GEF involves phosphorylation, we postulate that bFGF-induced phosphorylation of p85 βPIX may result in activation of Rac1. Here, we show that phosphorylation of p85 βPIX is directly associated with Rac1 activation in the bFGF signaling. Basic FGF stimulates Rac1 activation in a p85 βPIX phosphorylation-dependent manner. However, p85 βPIX-mediated Rac1 activation is not essential for translocation of the p85 βPIX complex including Rac1, suggesting that the phosphorylated protein regulates activation of Rac1 and translocation of the complex via two distinct signaling pathways in bFGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Our results provide an exemplar case of the mechanism by which Ras and Rac1, key small G proteins in cell regulation, are linked in a linear array for neurite outgrowth. Materials—Human recombinant bFGF, NGF, trypan blue, LipofectAMINE 2000, G418, and hygromycin B were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Anti-PAK2 and anti-Rac1 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and Upstate Biotechnology (Waltham, MA), respectively. Anti-GFP antibody, pDS-Red2 and pEGFP-C2 were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). Anti-p85 βPIX antibody was raised against the C-terminal region of p85 βPIX (439–648 amino acids). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). [35S]GTPγS was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA). GST-Rac1 and GST-PBD (p21-binding domain) were kindly provided by Dr. C. D. Bae (Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Suwon, Korea). DNA Constructs and Mutagenesis—PAK2 and p85 βPIX cDNA constructs were used as described previously (11.Shin E.Y. Shin K.S. Lee C.S. Woo K.N. Quan S.H. Soung N.K. Kim Y.G. Cha C.I. Kim S.R. Park D. Bokoch G.M. Kim E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44417-44430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of these cDNAs was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following primers were employed for mutagenic PCR: p85 βPIX (L238R/L239S): sense, 5′-GTACCCCACACGGTCAAAGGAGCTGGAGAG-3′ and antisense (5′-CTCTCCAGCTCCTTTGACCGTGTGGGGTAC-3′; PAK2 (P185A/R186A): sense, 5′-AAGTACCCCACATCGCGAAAGGAGCTGGAG-3′ and antisense, 5′-CTCCAGCTCCTTTCGCGATGTGGGGTACTT-3′. Rac1 was subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pDS-Red2 (Clontech) for use in determining subcellular localization. Cell Culture and Differentiation—PC12FW cells overexpressing FGF receptor-1 in a tetracycline-dependent manner were cultured as described previously (11.Shin E.Y. Shin K.S. Lee C.S. Woo K.N. Quan S.H. Soung N.K. Kim Y.G. Cha C.I. Kim S.R. Park D. Bokoch G.M. Kim E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44417-44430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Tet System approved fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm glutamine, 1× antibiotics (Invitrogen), 50 μg/ml hygromycin B and 100 μg/ml G418 at 37 °C in 10% CO2. For bFGF-induced differentiation, PC12FW cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM with 1.5 μg/ml doxycycline for 24 h to induce FGF receptor-1 expression, and replaced with DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, 10 ng/ml bFGF and 1.5 μg/ml doxycycline for 24–48 h. For NGF-induced differentiation, PC12FW cells were incubated with DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS and 100 ng/ml NGF. Transient Transfection—PC12FW cells were seeded on 60-mm culture dishes or 20 μg/ml poly-l-lysine-coated cover slips. A mixture of 5 μg DNA and 5 μl LipofectAMINE 2000 was added to culture dishes according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 24–48 h, transfected cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) were monitored with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, CK-40). Translocation of p85 βPIX and Its Effect on Neurite Outgrowth—To analyze translocation of p85 βPIX, PC12FW cells were cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips, induced to differentiate in culture media containing 10 ng/ml bFGF or 100 ng/ml NGF and 2% FBS for 48 h, and transfected with pEGFP-p85 βPIX using LipofectAMINE 2000. Transfected cells were incubated in DMEM containing 2% FBS in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml bFGF or 100 ng/ml NGF for 24–48 h. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% FBS, and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 5 min. After fixation, coverslips were washed twice in PBS and mounted onto a glass slide with gelvatol. Fluorescence was visualized with a laser confocal microscope (MRC-1024, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA). To analyze the effect of translocated p85 βPIX on neurite outgrowth, PC12FW cells were induced to differentiate as described above. Cells were transfected with pEGFP-WT-PIX (wild-type) or pEGFP-MT-PIX (GEF-negative form, L238R/L239S). Six hours after transfection, culture medium was replaced with complete medium containing 10 ng/ml bFGF. Transfected cells were monitored by phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy with an inverted fluorescence microscope for 48 h. Actin Staining—PC12FW cells were cultured on poly-l-lysine-coated cover slips and induced to differentiate with 10 ng/ml bFGF or with 100 ng/ml NGF as described in the above section. Cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% FBS, and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 5 min. After three rinses in PBS, cells were incubated in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2 μm phalloidin-TRITC for 30 min, washed three times in PBS and mounted onto a glass slide with gelvatol. Fluorescence was visualized with a laser confocal microscope. Neurite Retraction Assay—Neurite retraction assay was conduced as previously described (20.Tong J. Elowe S. Nash P. Pawson T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6111-6119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) with a slight modification. Briefly, PC12FW cells were differentiated for 24 h and then transiently transfected with plasmids encoding GFP fusion proteins of GST and wild-type or mutant p85 βPIX. After 6 h, cells were further differentiated with bFGF containing medium. Recording of changes in neurite length under a fluorescence microscope has begun at 24 h following transfection and lasted until 48 h. Cells with neurite length around two times their cell body length were initially selected. Measurement of Cell Viability—Viability of cultured cells in dishes was assessed by a trypan blue exclusion test. Briefly, PC12FW cells were induced to differentiate for the indicated times and transfected with plasmids encoding GFP fusion proteins of wild-type or mutant p85 βPIX. Changes in neurite extension or retraction were monitored under a fluorescence microscope for 24 h (from 24 to 48 h following transfection). Cells were then stained with 0.4% trypan blue (Invitrogen) for 15 min, followed by washing two times with PBS. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 200 μm orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 1 h at 4 °C. Proteins were immunoprecipitated with an appropriate antibody for 3 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by adding protein G Sepharose, and washed five times with lysis buffer and twice with PBS. Samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in a Tris-glycinemethanol buffer (25 mm Tris base, 200 mm glycine, 20% methanol). Membranes were blocked with 3% skimmed milk in PBS for 1 h, incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, and washed three times (10 min each) with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20. Membranes were blotted with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies for 1 h at RT. After five washes with PBS and 0.1% Tween-20, signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). In some cases, membranes were stripped and reprobed with different antibodies. In Vitro Binding Assay—GST or GST-Rac1 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli (DH5α) and purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Equal amounts of GST or GST-Rac1-Sepharose beads were incubated with PC12FW cell lysates or lysates from cells expressing various domains of GFP-p85 βPIX. Beads were washed five times with binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin), resolved on 9% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were immunoblotted with anti-p85 βPIX, GFP, or GST antibody. GST-PBD Binding Assay—Basic FGF- or NGF-stimulated GEF activity of p85 βPIX was measured using a modified version of Yang's method as described (21.Yang F.C. Atkinson S.J. Gu Y. Borneo J.B. Roberts A.W. Zheng Y. Pennington J. Williams D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5614-5618Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), which we call the GST-PBD binding assay. Briefly, GST-PBD was expressed in E. coli (DH5α) and purified with glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PAK2 or anti-GFP antibody. Immunoprecipitates were then loaded with 100 μm GTPγS at 37 °C for 20 min in exchange buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and washed five times with lysis buffer as described above. Immunoprecipitates were further incubated with purified soluble GST-PBD (1 μg) at 4 °C for 2 h in binding buffer (25 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm MgCl2, 40 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and washed five times with binding buffer. Beads were boiled for 5 min, resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Membranes were immunoblotted with anti-GST antibody and then reprobed with anti-PAK2, GFP, p85 βPIX, or Rac1 antibody. Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Assay—GEF activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of [35S]GTPγS into purified GST-Rac1, as described previously (9.Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). PC12FW cells expressing GFP-p85 βPIX (wild-type or mutant) were treated with 10 ng/ml bFGF for 1 h and solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 200 μm orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody. In an exchange assay, GFP-p85 βPIX immunoprecipitates, 3 μg of purified GST-Rac1, and 1 μCi of [35S]GTPγS were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in exchange buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2). The reaction mixture was filtered onto 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane and washed three times with washing buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2). Counts per minute (CPM) of bound [35S]GTPγS were measured using a liquid scintillation counter. Statistical Analysis—Student's paired t test was applied for statistical analysis of neurite retraction assay using The SAS System for Windows (release 8.01) and the statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. p85 βPIX Constitutively Binds to Rac1 through Its DH Domain—To investigate the molecular mechanism by which bFGF stimulates activation of Rac1, we employed a PC12FW model system in which the FGF receptor-1 is overexpressed (11.Shin E.Y. Shin K.S. Lee C.S. Woo K.N. Quan S.H. Soung N.K. Kim Y.G. Cha C.I. Kim S.R. Park D. Bokoch G.M. Kim E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44417-44430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It is suggested that βPIX forms a stable ternary complex with activated Cdc42 and PAK3 (22.Bagrodia S. Taylor S.J. Jordon K.A. Van Aelst L. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23633-23636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic analysis of the interaction between purified βPIX and G protein additionally suggested that the DH domain possesses binding capability in addition to catalytic activity on the G protein (16.Aghazadeh B. Zhu K. Kubiseski T.J. Liu G.A. Pawson T. Zheng Y. Rosen M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1098-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). To determine whether Rac1 binds to p85 βPIX in a complex cellular context, we employed immobilized GST or GST-Rac1 bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads as bait to precipitate endogenous p85 βPIX (Fig. 1A). No specific binding was observed between immobilized GST and p85 βPIX (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). However, GST-Rac1 strongly bound to p85 βPIX irrespective of bFGF stimulation (lanes 3 and 4). To further delineate the region of p85 βPIX responsible for Rac1 binding, cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the various domains of p85 βPIX (Fig. 1C), and lysates were affinity-precipitated with immobilized GST or GST-Rac1 (Fig. 1B). The various domains of p85 βPIX were expressed at similar levels (middle). In the control lanes GST did not precipitate DH-PH and SH3 domains (lanes 1 and 2, top). In contrast, GST-Rac1 specifically interacted with full-length p85 βPIX, DH and DH-PH domains (lanes 3, 5, and 7), but not with SH3 and PH domains (lanes 4 and 6). GBD and LZ domains did not bind GST-Rac1 (not shown). The data confirm that the DH domain of p85 βPIX is sufficient for Rac1 binding. Moreover, the interactions between p85 βPIX and Rac1 are constitutive. Basic FGF Stimulates Activation of Rac1 in a Dose- and Time-dependent Manner—Upon stimulation by agonists, Rho GTPases are converted to active GTP-bound forms, which specifically bind to and activate downstream effectors, such as PAK and Rho kinase (22.Bagrodia S.

Therefore, the binding site of PAK, p21-binding domain (PBD), has been expressed as a fusion protein of GST and been employed to determine the in vivo activity of Rac1 (21.Yang F.C. Atkinson S.J.

In this conventional GST-PBD pulldown assay GST-PBD is immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose beads and used to precipitate active Rac1. Here to specifically monitor Rac1 activation in the PIX complex, we made a slight modification of the conventional GST-PBD pull-down assay by using soluble GST-PBD instead of immobilized one. The principle of this assay, which we call GST-PBD binding assay, is depicted in Fig. 2A. Because the p85 βPIX protein forms a complex with PAK2 (9.Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q.

This pre-clearance step seemed to eliminate background interfering proteins in the lysate, which results in enhancement of a signal-to-noise ratio. We next incubated the immunoprecipitate with soluble GST-PBD and detected GST-PBD bound to active Rac1 by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibody. PC12FW cells were starved and stimulated with the indicated concentrations of bFGF for 1 h (Fig. 2B). Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-PAK2 antibody to retrieve the PIX complex, and activated GTP-bound Rac1 in this complex was determined using soluble GST-PBD as described above. Activated Rac1, evaluated by the accumulation of GST-PBD over the untreated control, is initially observed at 5 ng/ml bFGF. Rac1 activity increases in proportion to bFGF concentrations up to 30 ng/ml. To monitor a time-course of Rac1 activation, cells were stimulated with bFGF (10 ng/ml) for the indicated times (Fig. 2C). After bFGF stimulation, Rac1 activation is apparent at 30 min and reaches a peak at 1 h, followed by a gradual decrease. However, the activity maintains at relatively higher levels, even at 4 h. These results indicate that Rac1 is activated by bFGF in a dose- and time-dependent manner. ERK and PAK2 Function Upstream of bFGF-induced Rac1 Activation—Specific G proteins are activated via the phosphorylation of GEF (9–10). We speculated that bFGF-induced phosphorylation of p85 βPIX might also operate for Rac1 activation. In a previous study, we showed that ERK and PAK2 are the upstream kinases for p85 βPIX phosphorylation (11.Shin E.Y. Shin K.S. Lee C.S. Woo K.N. Quan S.H. Soung N.K. Kim Y.G. Cha C.I. Kim S.R.

Accordingly, we examined whether these two kinases act as upstream regulators in bFGF-induced Rac1 activation. For this purpose, we used PD98059, a specific inhibitor of MEK, or a plasmid encoding a PAK-inhibitory domain (PID) (11.Shin E.Y. Shin K.S. Lee C.S. Woo K.N. Quan S.H. Soung N.K. Kim Y.G. Cha C.I.

Cells were starved and treated with bFGF for 1 h. Lysates were processed as in Fig. 2. Basic FGF induced a ∼4-fold increase in Rac1 activity (Fig. 3A, lane 2), consistent with the result from Fig. 2. Preincubation with PD98059 abolished bFGF-induced Rac1 activation (lane 3). Similarly, expression of PID resulted in marked inhibition of Rac1 activity (lanes 4 and 5). These results strongly suggest that ERK/PAK2-mediated phosphorylation of p85 βPIX is closely associated with Rac1 activation. It is well established that PAK2 interacts with p85 βPIX, and that two residues of PAK2, specifically, proline 185 and arginine 186, are critical in this association (9.Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G.

Single channel analyses revealed that mutation Q4863A dramatically altered the kinetics and apparent affinity of ryanodine interaction with single RyR2 channels and abolished the effect of ryanodol, an analogue of ryanodine, whereas the single channel conductance of the Q4863A mutant and its responses to caffeine, ATP, and Mg2+ were comparable to those of the wild type channels. Furthermore the effect of ryanodine on single Q4863A mutant channels was influenced by the transmembrane holding potential. Together these results suggest that the TM10 sequence and in particular the Q4863 residue constitute an important determinant of ryanodine interaction.

They play an essential role in various cellular functions including excitation-contraction coupling, fertilization, and apoptosis (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

Three RyR isoforms, RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3, are expressed in mammalian tissues. Mutations in the RyR1 gene have been linked to two human diseases, malignant hyperthermia and central core disease (8Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. Physiol.

To understand the impact of the disease-causing mutations and hence the molecular and cellular basis of the diseases, detailed knowledge of the structure-function relationships of RyRs is required. ryanodine receptor human embryonic kidney transmembrane 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate wild type glutathione S-transferase FK506-binding protein, 12.6 kDa. ryanodine receptor human embryonic kidney transmembrane 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate wild type glutathione S-transferase FK506-binding protein, 12.6 kDa. One of the most widely used probes for studying the structure and function of RyRs is ryanodine, a plant alkaloid. The high affinity and specificity of the interaction of ryanodine with RyRs has facilitated the identification, purification, and cloning of the channel (2Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1485-C1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 4Ogawa Y. Crit. Rev.

Ryanodine has also been used to investigate the structural changes associated with channel gating and the mechanisms of ion conduction. Large ryanodine-induced conformational changes in the three-dimensional structure of RyR, in particular in the cytoplasmic assembly, have been observed (13Orlova E.V. Serysheva I.I. van Heel M. Hamilton S.L. Chiu W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). By monitoring the actions of ryanodine on single RyR channels it has been established that this ligand causes profound alterations in channel function. Interactions of ryanodine with a high affinity site on the channel induce the occurrence of a reduced conductance state with increased open probability, producing an overall effect of channel activation. In the presence of high micromolar to millimolar concentrations of ryanodine the RyR channel closes (5Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Welch W. Ruest L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 53-98PubMed Google Scholar, 14Williams A.J. West D.J. Sitsapesan R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 61-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). While the functional effects of ryanodine have been well characterized, the structural basis of the action of ryanodine is largely undefined. To identify the determinants of ryanodine-RyR interaction within the ryanodine molecule, a large number of ryanodine derivatives (ryanoids) have been generated, and their binding properties have been characterized. The affinity and kinetics of interaction with RyR of different ryanoids were found to vary considerably. Unlike ryanodine, which modifies RyR in an irreversible manner on the time scale of single channel experiments, some ryanoids exhibit a reversible effect on single RyR channel function. These reversible ryanoids have provided useful probes for studying the mechanisms of ryanoid-RyR interaction and have been used to demonstrate that ryanoid-RyR interaction is influenced by transmembrane voltage (15Tinker A.

Comprehensive analyses of the binding properties of various ryanoids have revealed that the pyrrole locus at the 3-position of the ryanodine molecule is absolutely required for high affinity ryanodine binding to RyR. In addition to the pyrrole group, other loci on the ryanodine molecule are also involved in binding to RyR (5Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Welch W. Ruest L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 53-98PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular determinants of ryanodine binding in the RyR molecule are, however, much less defined as compared with those in the ryanodine molecule. Biochemical and functional expression studies have localized the ryanodine binding site to the COOH-terminal portion, the pore-forming region, of RyR (19Callaway C. Seryshev A. Wang J.P. Slavik K.J.

J. 1997; 73: 1329-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Evidence in support of a pore localization of the high affinity ryanodine binding site in RyR comes from recent site-directed mutagenesis in a motif located in a luminal loop linking transmembrane domains 8 and 10 (TM8 and TM10) (22Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Phillips M. Green N.M. Lai F.A. Meissner G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2244-2256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 4820GVRAGGGIGD4829. Mutations in this highly conserved motif abolish or markedly reduce high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding to RyR, suggesting that this region constitutes an essential determinant of ryanodine interaction (23Zhao M. Li P. Li X. Zhang L. Winkfein R.J. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25971-25974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 24Chen S.R. Li P. Zhao M. Li X. Zhang L.

Chem. 2001; 276: 31760-31771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The identified residues are, however, unlikely to be the only determinants of ryanodine interaction with RyR since multiple regions of the ryanodine molecule are involved in ryanodine binding. If ryanodine interacts with residues in the putative selectivity filter of RyR (24Chen S.R. Li P. Zhao M. Li X. Zhang L. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2436-2447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), additional determinants of binding would most probably reside in regions that form the membrane-spanning conduction pore of the RyR channel. Based on the hypothetical model of the RyR conduction pore (14Williams A.J. West D.J. Sitsapesan R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2001; 34: 61-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), we have proposed that the putative central cavity of the RyR channel, which is presumably formed, at least in part, by the TM10 segment, contains additional determinants for ryanodine interaction (24Chen S.R. Li P. Zhao M. Li X. Zhang L. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2436-2447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we have carried out a systematic investigation of the significance of the TM10 segment in ryanodine interaction and RyR channel function. We have mutated each residue in the TM10 sequence and determined the effects of the mutations by monitoring caffeine- and ryanodine-induced release of intracellular Ca2+ in HEK293 cells and by measuring binding of [3H]ryanodine to RyR in cell lysates. We have demonstrated that mutations in the TM10 segment can alter the response of RyR to caffeine and/or ryanodine and dramatically reduce the binding of [3H]ryanodine. We have also shown that a single mutation, Q4863A, within TM10 dramatically alters the kinetics and affinity of ryanodine interaction with single RyR2 channels. These observations indicate that the TM10 segment is an essential determinant of ryanodine interaction with RyR2. Part of this work has been presented in abstract form (27Wang R. Bolstad J. Brown C. Zhang L. Chen S.R. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 427aGoogle Scholar). Materials—Ryanodine was obtained from Calbiochem. [3H]Ryanodine was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Anti-RyR antibody was purchased from Affinity Bioreagents Inc. Brain phosphatidylserine, heart phosphatidylethanolamine, and plant phosphatidylcholine were from Avanti Polar Lipids. CHAPS and other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Ryanodol was synthesized as described earlier (5Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Welch W. Ruest L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 53-98PubMed Google Scholar). Site-directed Mutagenesis and DNA Transfection—Single point mutations were introduced into the proposed transmembrane helix TM10 of the mouse cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) by the overlap extension method (28Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) using PCR. The NruI (14,237 bp)-NotI (vector) fragment containing a mutation in the TM10 segment was removed from the PCR products and was subcloned into the full-length mouse RyR2 cDNA. Each mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The generation of mutations G4824A and G4826C within the proposed pore-forming segment of RyR2 has been described earlier (23Zhao M. Li P. Li X.

HEK293 cells grown on 100-mm tissue culture dishes in supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 18–20 h after subculture were transfected with 12–16 μg of wild type (wt) or mutant RyR2 cDNA using the method of Ca2+ phosphate precipitation (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.30-16.73Google Scholar). GST-FKBP12.6 Pull-down and Immunoblotting Analyses—Cell lysates from 2 dishes (100 mm in diameter) of transfected HEK293 cells were prepared as described previously (30Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (20 μl) that was prewashed with PBS (137 mm NaCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl) and prebound with 40 μg of GST-FKBP12.6 at 4 °C for 17–19 h. The glutathione-Sepharose beads were washed with ice-cold lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 137 mm NaCl, 1% CHAPS, 0.5% plant phosphatidylcholine, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) three times, each time for 10 min. The proteins bound to the Sepharose beads were solubilized by the addition of 20 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer (24Chen S.R. Li P. Zhao M. Li X. Zhang L. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2436-2447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) plus 5% β-mercaptoethanol and boiled at 100 °C for 5 min. The solubilized proteins (20 μl) were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE (31Masumiya H. Wang R. Zhang J. Xiao B. Chen S.R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3786-3792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The SDS-PAGE-resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 45 V for 18–20 h at 4 °C in the presence of 0.01% SDS according to Towbin et al. (32Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked for 30 min with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 and 5% skim milk powder. The blocked membrane was incubated with the anti-RyR antibody and washed three times each time for 15 min with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20. The membrane was then incubated with the secondary anti-mouse IgG (heavy and light) antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase for 30–40 min. After washing three times each time for 15 min, the bound antibodies were visualized by the alkaline phosphatase-mediated color reaction using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as the substrates. [3H]Ryanodine Binding—Equilibrium [3H]ryanodine binding to cell lysates was performed as described previously (30Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) with some modifications. [3H]Ryanodine binding was carried out in a total volume of 300 μl of binding solution containing 30 μl of cell lysate, 500 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 200 μm CaCl2, 2.5 mm caffeine, 5 nm [3H]ryanodine, and the protease inhibitor mixture at 37 °C for 2–3 h. The binding mixture was diluted with 5 ml of ice-cold washing buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 250 mm KCl and was immediately filtered through Whatman GF/B filters presoaked with 1% polyethylenimine. The filters were washed, and the radioactivities associated with the filters were determined by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined by measuring [3H]ryanodine binding in the presence of 20 μm unlabeled ryanodine. All binding assays were done in duplicate. Analysis of Ryanodine Interaction with Single Q4863A Mutant Channels—The interaction of ryanodine with individual Q4863A mutant channels was analyzed as described previously (18Tanna B. Welch W. Ruest L. Sutko J.L. Williams A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 2003; 121: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In brief, durations in the normal and ryanodine-modified states were measured directly from digitized single channel recordings and were used to obtain the corresponding mean dwell times. The apparent rate constants for association (kon) and dissociation (koff) of ryanodine interaction were determined from the mean dwell times in the ryanodine-unmodified (tunmod) and ryanodine-modified (tmod) states using the equations: kon = tunmod–1 and koff = tmod–1. The following equations were used to describe the relationship between voltage and the rate constants of association and dissociation: kon(V) = kon(0) × exp(–zon(FV/RT)) and koff(V) = koff(0) × exp(zoff(FV/RT)) where k(V) and k(0) are the rate constants at a particular voltage and at 0 mV, respectively, and z is the valence of the reaction. Plots of the natural logarithm of kon and koffversus holding potential should yield a linear relationship with slopes–zonF/RT and zoffF/RT and intercepts ln(kon(0)) and ln(koff(0)), respectively. The total voltage dependence of the reaction is ztotal = zon + zoff. The dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated using the equation: Kd (μm) = koff (s–1)/kon (μm–1 s–1). Ca2+Release Measurements and Single Channel Recordings—The free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in transfected HEK293 cells was monitored using the fluorescence Ca2+ indicator dye fluo-3-AM as described previously (30Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Recombinant RyR2 wt and mutant proteins were purified from whole cell lysate by sucrose density gradient centrifugation and were used for single channel recordings as described previously (30Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Construction and Expression of Mutants in the Proposed Transmembrane Segment TM10 —The proposed transmembrane segment TM10 consists of 24 amino acid residues from Ile4844[1] to Ile4867[24] (22Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Phillips M. Green N.M. Lai F.A. Meissner G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2244-2256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Square brackets indicate the position of residues in TM10 numbered from the NH2 terminus. To investigate the role of the TM10 segment in ryanodine-RyR interaction, we mutated each amino acid residue in the TM10 sequence to alanine or, in the case of residue Ala4860, to glycine by site-directed mutagenesis using the overlap extension method. To examine the expression of these mutants, HEK293 cells were transfected transiently with wt or mutant RyR2 cDNA. The expressed wt and mutant RyR2 proteins were pulled down by GST-FKBP12.6 bound to glutathione-Sepharose from transfected HEK293 cell lysate, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with an anti-RyR antibody. As shown in Fig. 1B, all TM10 mutants were expressed in HEK293 cells, and their levels of expression were comparable with that of the wt. No immunoreactivity of the anti-RyR antibody was detected from HEK293 cells transfected with the expression vector DNA, pCDNA3 (data not shown). These results also showed that all TM10 mutants retained the ability to bind FKBP12.6. Effect of Mutations in the TM10 Segment on [3H]Ryanodine Binding—We next examined the impact of the mutations on ryanodine-RyR interaction by measuring [3H]ryanodine binding to each TM10 mutant in cell lysates. [3H]Ryanodine binding was carried out in the presence of 200 μm Ca2+ and 2.5 mm caffeine, a condition under which the RyR channel is strongly activated and hence is optimal for the detection of binding. As shown in Fig. 2, [3H]ryanodine bound to the majority of RyR2 TM10 mutants. Mutants I4844A[1], I4845A[2], I4848A[5], F4852A[9], F4853A[10], V4854A[11], I4857A[14], A4860A[17], I4861A[18], I4862A[19], G4864A[21], L4865A[22], and I4867A[24] all had binding capacities in excess of 25% of the wt RyR2. In contrast, mutants F4846A[3], D4847A[4], T4849A[6], F4850A[7], F4851A[8], I4855A[12], V4856A[13], L4858A[15], L4859A[16], Q4863A[20], and I4866A[23] displayed binding capacities of 5% or less of wt RyR2 (Fig. 2 and Table I). As all mutants were expressed in HEK293 cells at a comparable level, the lack of [3H]ryanodine binding to this latter group of mutants was not due to poor expression. These data indicate that mutations in the TM10 segment of RyR2 can have a profound influence on the binding of [3H]ryanodine.Table I[3H]Ryanodine binding and caffeine and ryanodine response of TM10 mutantsTM10 mutants[3H]Ryanodine bindingCaffeine responseRyanodine response%RyR2(wt)100 ± 36++I4844A[1]47 ± 22++I4845A[2]74 ± 14++F4846A[3]5.4 ± 5.0++D4847A[4]0.6 ± 0.8--I4848A[5]59 ± 10++T4849A[6]0.5 ± 0.8++F4850A[7]0.1 ± 0.5--F4851A[8]0.1 ± 0.3--F4852A[9]84 ± 16++F4853A[10]99 ± 28++V4854A[11]36 ± 1.2++I4855A[12]3.8 ± 1.6++V4856A[13]1.0 ± 0.9++I4857A[14]64 ± 2.4++L4858A[15]2.5 ± 1.6--L4859A[16]3.8 ± 1.4--A4860G[17]58 ± 3.5++I4861A[18]98 ± 5.7++I4862A[19]61 ± 2.7+-Q4863A[20]0.0 ± 0.0+-G4864A[21]93 ± 4.3++L4865A[22]87 ± 7.1++I4866A[23]5.1 ± 1.8--I4867A[24]25 ± 6.7+- Open table in a new tab Caffeine and Ryanodine Response of HEK293 Cells Expressing the wt and Mutant RyR2—Since the high affinity ryanodine binding site is only available when the RyR channel is in an open conformation (16Tanna B.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6702-6709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the profound reduction in [3H]ryanodine binding to some TM10 mutants could indicate that these mutations yield channels that do not open under the conditions used in our binding experiments. In other words, the mutant channel, although readily expressed, is not a functional Ca2+ release channel. To examine the functional state of the TM10 mutant channels that displayed minimal binding of [3H]ryanodine we monitored caffeine- and ryanodine-induced release of intracellular Ca2+ in HEK293 cells expressing wt and mutant RyR2. Transfected HEK293 cells were loaded with a fluorescent Ca2+ indicator, fluo-3-AM. Intracellular Ca2+ transients were monitored by measuring the fluo-3 fluorescence intensity before and after the application of extracellular caffeine or ryanodine. As seen in Fig. 3A, a, a transient increase in fluorescence intensity in HEK293 cells expressing wt RyR2 was induced by both caffeine and ryanodine. Cells expressing mutants F4846A[3], T4849A[6], I4855A[12], V4856A[13], and Q4863A[20] all displayed measurable release of Ca2+ in the presence of either 0.25 and/or 2.5 mm caffeine (Figs. 3A, b–f), demonstrating that these mutants form caffeine-activated Ca2+ release channels in HEK293 cells. Furthermore ryanodine-induced Ca2+ release was also detected in HEK293 cells expressing the mutants F4846A[3], T4849A[6], I4855A[12], and V4856A[13] (Figs. 3A, b–e), indicating that these mutant channels remain sensitive to ryanodine modulation in HEK293 cells despite their lack of [3H]ryanodine binding in cell lysates. On the other hand, no measurable caffeine- or ryanodine-induced intracellular Ca2+ release was detected in HEK293 cells expressing mutants D4847A[4], F4850A[7], F4851A[8], L4858A[15], L4859A[16], or I4866A[23] (Fig. 3B). Although expressed in quantities comparable to wt, these mutants displayed severe alterations in channel activation by caffeine and ryanodine. [3H]Ryanodine binding data and the responses to caffeine and ryanodine of HEK293 cells expressing RyR2 wt and all TM10 mutants are summarized in Table I. It should be noted that all TM10 mutants that displayed [3H]ryanodine binding capacities in excess of 25% of wt functioned as ligand-activated Ca2+ release channels in HEK293 cells and that HEK293 cells transfected with the expression vector DNA, pCDNA3, displayed no caffeine- or ryanodine-induced Ca2+ release (data not shown). Interestingly, of the 24 mutants made in the TM10 sequence, Q4863A[20] is the only mutant that lacks both [3H]ryanodine binding and ryanodine-induced Ca2+ release but retains considerable caffeine-induced Ca2+ release activity (Fig. 3A, f, and Table I). These data suggest that residue Gln4863[20] is likely to play a critical role in ryanodine-RyR interaction. Effect of the Q4863A[20] Mutation on the Kinetic and Ligand Gating Properties of Ryanodine Interaction with Single RyR2 Channels—The significance of residue Gln4863[20] in ryanodine-RyR interaction was further investigated by monitoring the effect of ryanodine on single Q4863A[20] mutant channels. We have shown previously that the interaction of ryanodine with single wt RyR2 channels induces a dramatic increase in open probability (Po) and a reduction in unitary conductance (36Masumiya H. Li P. Zhang L. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39727-39735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Once bound, the rate of dissociation of ryanodine from RyR2 wt is so slow that the interaction can be considered as irreversible on the time scale of a single channel experiment. Our inability to detect either [3H]ryanodine binding to the Q4863A[20] mutant channel or ryanodine-induced Ca2+ release in cells expressing this mutant suggests that the mutation has dramatic effects on ryanodine interaction with RyR2. Consistent with this view, we found that the interaction of ryanodine with single Q4863A[20] mutant channels was reversible. Fig. 4A, shows a single Q4863A[20] mutant channel activated by Ca2+ in the absence of ryanodine. Under these conditions we observed current fluctuations between the closed and open states. The addition of ryanodine (20 μm) to the cytosolic side of the channel led to the occurrence of short periods of gating in which unitary conductance was reduced and Po increased (Fig. 4B). Consistent with our previous observation that the probability of ryanoid modification is dependent upon channel Po (16Tanna B. Welch W. Ru"
https://openalex.org/W2043223263,"The retinoid N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-HPR also known as fenretinide) is a potent inducer of apoptosis in breast cancer cells. We observed a 4.5-fold reduction in 4-HPR-mediated apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells transfected with HER2/neu (MCF-7/HER2) as compared with the parental MCF-7 (MCF-7/WT) cells. Blocking HER2/neu with trastuzumab (Herceptin) led to a six-fold increase in 4-HPR-induced apoptosis in HER2/neu-overexpressing cells. These data indicate that HER2/neu reduces the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to 4-HPR. We showed previously that nitric oxide (NO) is essential for 4-HPR to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells. The inhibitory effects of the 4-HPR and trastuzumab combination correlated with the amount of NO produced in HER2/neu-overexpressing cells. When a NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor was used to block NO production, decreased apoptosis by the 4-HPR and trastuzumab combination was observed. Furthermore, 4-HPR-mediated NOSII expression was lower in MCF-7/HER2 than MCF-7/WT cells, but was increased by trastuzumab in HER2/neu-overexpressing cells. Here we report the novel findings that HER2/neu reduces the ability of 4-HPR to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells, and that one mechanism by which HER2/neu increases the resistance of breast cancer cells to 4-HPR is by decreasing NOSII-mediated NO production."

Deregulation of the secretion of these pro-inflammatory cytokines is associated with septic shock and other inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. When complexed with a serum protein, LPS binds to the molecule CD14 on the surface of macrophages. The CD14 receptor itself lacks a cytosolic domain, yet it appears to interact with the toll-like receptors that, in turn, can transduce the signal across the plasma membrane (1Ulevitch R.J.

Indeed, activation of the toll-like receptors triggers an intracellular signaling cascade that involves the adapter proteins MyD 88 and IRAK, and the TRAF6 proteins (for a review see Ref. 5Mak T.W. Yeh W.C. Nature. 2002; 418: 835-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The LPS signal transduction pathway involves the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins and the activation of different mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, including the classical MAPK pathway (6Weinstein S.L.

However, the precise molecular mechanism by which LPS activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1 and ERK2) in the classic MAPK pathway is still not fully understood.The Cot/tpl-2 gene encodes a MAPK kinase kinase (MKKK) that in overexpression studies was originally reported to be capable of triggering several MAPK cascades, namely those leading to activation of the MAPKs ERK1/ERK2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38, and ERK5 (10Salmeron A.

However, more recent studies have shown that peritoneal macrophages from Cot/tpl-2 knockout mice do not activate ERK1/ERK2 in response to LPS, although the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 MAPK pathways remain the same as in wild type mice (15Dumitru C.D.

This suggests that under normal conditions, Cot/tpl-2 may act more specifically within the classical MAPK cascade than when overexpressed in cells. Thus, Cot/tpl-2 is one of the three proteins that can activate MAPK kinase 1 (MKK1) in cells, together with Raf and Mos.The Cot/tpl-2 proto-oncogene was originally identified in a modified C-terminally truncated form.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that Cot is the only MKKK that activates MKK1, and hence ERK1 and ERK2, in macrophages in response to these signals. We also provide evidence that 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), but not rosiglitazone, blocks the LPS-induced activation of Cot and that it also inhibits Cot activity in vitro. These data indicate that 15d-PGJ2 inhibits LPS-induced Cot activation through a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ)-independent mechanism.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from Invitrogen.

Antibodies used to immunoprecipitate Cot and c-Raf were raised in sheep against the Cot immunogenic peptide, CQSLDSALFDRKRLLSRKELE, and bacterially expressed c-Raf protein by the Division of Signal Transduction Therapy at the University of Dundee (performed in P. C.'s laboratory). The rabbit anti-Cot antibody utilized for Western blot analysis has been described previously (22Ballester A. Tobena R. Lisbona C. Calvo V. Alemany S. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1613-1618PubMed Google Scholar).Cell Culture, Metabolic Labeling, and Stimulation—RAW264 macrophages were maintained in a 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere in RPMI plus 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin. One day prior to stimulation, macrophages were plated at a density of 1.2 × 106 cells/90-cm plate. Three hours later, the medium was removed and replaced overnight with 8 ml of RPMI with 1% (v/v) heat-inactivated FBS. For metabolic labeling, cells were kept in methionine-, cysteine- and glutamine-free RPMI for 20 min and then pulsed overnight with RPMI plus 1% heat-inactivated FBS dialyzed against phosphate saline buffer plus 100 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine labeling mixture. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were stimulated with 500 ng/ml LPS, 50 μm Taxol, or 0.4 μg/ml PMA for the times specified in the figure legends. Where indicated, 15d-PGJ2 (10 μm), rosiglitazone (10 μm), or PGE2 (5 mm) was added to the medium 60 min before stimulation. Gö6850 (1 μm) and LY 294002 (50 μm) were added to the medium 30 min before stimulation and Herb A (1 μg/ml) 3 h before stimulation.Immunoprecipitation and Assay of Cot and c-Raf—After stimulation, the medium was removed, and the cells were solubilized in 0.5 ml of ice cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.27 m sucrose, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and complete proteinase inhibitor mixture, 1 tablet/10 ml). The samples were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in aliquots at -70 °C until analysis. Cell extracts were thawed at 0 °C and centrifuged for 10 min at 24,000 × g, and protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method. The protein c-Raf was immunoprecipitated for 1 h at 4 °C by incubating 0.5 mg of cell lysate protein with 1 μg of c-Raf antibody that had been coupled to protein G-Sepharose. Cot was immunoprecipitated for 3 h at 4 °C by incubating 0.5 mg of cell lysate protein with 1.5 μg of Cot antibody covalently bound to protein G-Sepharose. The different immunoprecipitates were washed and subjected to a two-step kinase assay as described previously for c-Raf (30Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Ashworth A. Cowley S. Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). One unit of Cot or c-Raf activity was that amount of enzyme that incorporated 1 nmol of phosphate into myelin basic protein in 1 min.Western Blot Analysis—Western blotting was performed by resolving 35 μg of cell lysate protein on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with anti-phospho-ERK1/ERK2 or anti-phospho-MKK1 antibodies. The blots were developed using a chemiluminescent method (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). As a control of protein loading on the gels, the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were re-probed with anti-ERK2 or anti-MKK1 antibodies.RESULTSLPS and Taxol Activate Cot but Not c-Raf—Treatment of RAW264 macrophages with LPS (500 ng/ml) produced a time-dependent activation of endogenous Cot activity (Fig. 1). Maximal activation reached about 10-fold the basal levels and was attained 15 min after the addition of LPS. In contrast, LPS stimulation did not augment the activity of c-Raf. Because Taxol is reported to mimic LPS-induced activation of murine macrophages through an interaction with CD14 (31Kawasaki K. Nogawa H. Nishijima M. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 413-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 32Moos P.J. Muskardin D.T. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar, 33O'Brien Jr., J.M. Wewers M.D. Moore S.A. Allen J.N. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4113-4122PubMed Google Scholar), we also examined the effect of stimulating RAW264.7 macrophages with 50 μm Taxol for different time periods on Cot and c-Raf activity. Not only did Taxol increase the specific activity of endogenous Cot, although to a lesser extent than LPS, but also Taxol failed to up-regulate c-Raf activity (Fig. 1).PMA Activates c-Raf but Not Cot—It has been well established that through protein kinase C (PKC), the tumor-promoting phorbol esters can trigger the activation of the classical MAPK cascade in a wide variety of cells, including macrophages. We therefore set out to compare the mechanism by which PMA and LPS activate this signaling pathway in macrophages. Stimulation of RAW264 cells with 0.4 μg/ml PMA increased c-Raf activity about 10-fold, with the maximal increase occurring 5 min after stimulation. However, in sharp contrast to LPS or Taxol, PMA did not activate Cot activity (Fig. 1), indicating that PMA and LPS/Taxol activate the MAPK cascade in different ways.The Mechanism by Which LPS Activates Cot—In Western blots of endogenous immunoprecipitated Cot, a single band that migrated in the position expected for the Cot polypeptide was observed (Fig. 2A). On this basis, we assessed the possibility that LPS increased Cot activity by modulating its association/dissociation with putative regulatory subunit(s). Unstimulated and LPS-stimulated cells were labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, and endogenous Cot was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and subsequent autoradiography revealed a single radiolabeled band of the expected size for Cot (Fig. 2B). The absence of any other labeled protein implied that Cot activation by LPS does not result from its association with, or dissociation from, any other protein.Fig. 2Immunoprecipitation of endogenous Cot from RAW264 macrophages stimulated or not with LPS.A, Cot immunoprecipitated from control cell lysates (250 μg) was subjected to Western blot analysis with rabbit anti-Cot antibody. B, 35S-labeled RAW cells were stimulated or not stimulated with 500 ng/ml LPS for 15 min. Cot was immunoprecipitated from the different RAW cells extracts in the presence or absence of 10 mm immunogenic peptide and resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography and radioactivity quantification by Instant Imager. The figure shows one of three experiments performed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Another possible mechanism for Cot activation might involve its phosphorylation at one or more residues. However, treatment of Cot immunoprecipitated from LPS-stimulated cells with high concentrations of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatases 1 or 2A or protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B did not affect the activity of Cot (data not shown). Moreover, the inhibition of serine/threonine phosphatases PP1 or PP2A, potential regulators of Cot phosphorylation, by incubating RAW cells with okadaic acid, did not increase Cot activity (data not shown). Finally, we also transfected Cot into HEK293 cells, which were then stimulated with the protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate, or with orthovanadate plus okadaic acid. However, neither of these treatments increased the activity of Cot (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that it is unlikely that serine/threonine phosphorylation of Cot is responsible for the way in which LPS influences its level of activity.Inhibitors of Protein Tyrosine Kinases Block the Activation of Cot by LPS—Herb A is an irreversible inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinases, and it has been found to block both LPS-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation and the activation of ERK1/ERK2 in macrophages (6Weinstein S.L. Sanghera J.S. Lemke K. DeFranco A.L. Pelech S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14955-14962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the effects that this inhibitor might have on Cot activation. Preincubating RAW264 cells with Herb A prevented the activation of Cot by LPS or Taxol (Fig. 3A), although the same treatment did not affect the activation of c-Raf by PMA. Furthermore, Herb A inhibited the activation of MKK1 and ERK1/ERK2 by LPS or Taxol but not by PMA (Fig. 3B). Similar results were also obtained when Herb A was replaced by genistein or tyrphostin AG825, other protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors not structurally related to Herb A (data not shown).Fig. 3Herb A inhibits Cot activation by LPS. Macrophages were preincubated with Herb A (1 μg/ml) for 3 h and then stimulated with LPS (200 ng/ml) for 15 min, with Taxol (50 μm) for 20 min, or with PMA (0.4 μg/ml) for 5 min. A, Cot or c-Raf was immunoprecipitated from different LPS-, Taxol-, or PMA-treated cells, and MKK1 kinase activity was measured. The results are represented as the mean ± S.E. for three different determinations from two separate dishes. The value 1 corresponds to Cot or c-Raf activities from control cells. B, lysates of the differently treated cells were electrophoresed and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-ERK1/ERK2 and anti-phospho-MKK1 antibodies. As a control of protein loaded, total ERK2 and total MKK1 levels, respectively, were tested. Similar results were obtained in three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Activation of Cot by LPS Is Independent of Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase and Protein Kinase C—It has been reported that protein kinase B, which is activated “downstream” of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), induces the phosphorylation of the C terminus of Cot and that this event is accompanied by an increase in NF-κB activation (26Kane L.P. Mollenauer M.N. Xu Z. Turck C.W. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5962-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, the preincubation of RAW264 cells for 30 min with an inhibitor of PI3K, LY 294002 (50 μm), did not block the phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2 or MKK1 upon stimulation with LPS or PMA (data not shown). Moreover, co-transfection of an active form of PI3K together with Cot in HEK293 cells did not increase the activity of Cot, whether or not the cells were exposed to orthovanadate (data not shown). Protein kinase Cϵ (PKCϵ) has been reported to play a critical role in macrophage activation and in the generation of TNF-α (34Castrillo A. Pennington D.J. Otto F. Parker P.J. Owen M.J. Bosca L. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 1231-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Because Cot also participates in TNF-α secretion (15Dumitru C.D. Ceci J.D. Tsatsanis C. Kontoyiannis D. Stamatakis K.

Tobena R. Alemany S. J. Biol.

As expected, incubation of RAW cells with Gö6850, an inhibitor of PKCα, PKCβ1, PKCδ, and PKCϵ, blocked the PMA-induced activation of c-Raf, MKK1, and ERK1/ERK2. However, preincubation with Gö6850 did not affect the LPS-induced activation of Cot or the phosphorylation of MKK1 and ERK1/ERK2 (Fig. 4), indicating that neither PI3K nor PKCϵ is involved in the activation of Cot by LPS.Fig. 4Gö6850 does not inhibit Cot activation by LPS. Macrophages were preincubated with Gö6850 (1 μm) for 30 min and then stimulated with LPS (200 ng/ml) for 15 min or with PMA (0.4 μg/ml) for 5 min. The phosphorylation states of ERK1/ERK2 and MKK1 (A) and Cot or c-Raf activities (B) were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The value 100% corresponds to Cot or c-Raf activities when cells were stimulated, respectively, with LPS or PMA.

Preincubation of RAW264 macrophages with 15d-PGJ2 (10 μm), a potent natural ligand of PPAR-γ, completely suppressed the activation of Cot by LPS or Taxol (Fig. 5A). Consistent with this finding, when cells were preincubated with 15d-PGJ2, neither MKK1 nor ERK1/ERK2 were activated by LPS. Nevertheless preincubation with 15d-PGJ2 did not decrease the levels of LPS-induced tyrosine phosphorylation as determined by Western blot analysis (data not shown). On the other hand, neither the PMA-induced activation of c-Raf nor the PMA-induced phosphorylation of MKK1 and ERK1/ERK2 was affected by preincubation with 15d-PGJ2 (Fig. 5A).Fig. 515d-PGJ2 inhibits ERK1/ERK2 activation via Cot in RAW macrophages.A, RAW264 macrophages were preincubated with 15d-PGJ2 (PGJ2, 10 μm) for 60 min and then stimulated with LPS for 15 min (200 ng/ml), with Taxol (50 μm) for 20 min, or with PMA for 5 min (0.4 μg/ml), and the phosphorylation state of ERK1/ERK2 and MKK1, as well as Cot or c-Raf activities, was determined. The figure shows one of three experiments performed, and the graphs represent the mean of three different determinations ± S.E. The value 1 corresponds to Cot or c-Raf activities from control cells.

https://openalex.org/W2022135649,"<i>Cryptosporidium parvum,</i> an Apicomplexan parasite of the mammalian gut epithelium, causes a diarrheal illness in a wide range of hosts and is transmitted by contamination of food or water with oocyst-laden feces from an infected animal. We have identified a glycosylinositol phospholipid from the sporozoite stage of the parasite that is frequently recognized by serum antibodies from human cryptosporidiosis patients. The humoral immune response is dominated by IgG<sub>1</sub> subclass antibodies but can also include IgA and IgM antibodies. The glycosylinositol phospholipids were purified by butanol extraction of a Triton X-114-soluble fraction followed by octyl-Sepharose column chromatography and preparative high performance TLC and were shown to include at least 5 species. By using mass spectrometry and radiolabeled neutral glycan analysis, we found that the structure of the dominant glycosylinositol phospholipid antigen contained a C18:0 lyso<i>-</i>acylglycerol, a C16:0-acylated inositol, and an unsubstituted mannose<sub>3</sub>-glucosamine glycan core. Other diacyl species were also identified, most notably a series of glycosylinositol phospholipids having an acyl-linked C20:0 to C28:0 lipid on the inositol ring. Less abundant species having three acyl-linked fatty acids and species with an additional 1–3 hexoses linked to the mannose core were also observed. We are currently working to determine the role that these glycolipids may play in the development of disease and in the clearance of infection."
https://openalex.org/W2070142231,"Apobec-1 is the catalytic subunit of a multicomponent editosome complex that mediates apolipoprotein B (apoB) mRNA editing. We isolated a novel apobec-1-interacting protein by yeast two-hybrid cloning and identified the protein as BAG-4. BAG-4, a chaperone-regulating protein, also known as SODD (silencer of death domains), is a member of the BAG family of proteins. In this report, we found that apobec-1 is localized in the perinucleolar compartment in HepG2 cells and rat liver MCR-RH7777 cells. BAG-4 binds to apobec-1 via its N-terminal region independent of the BAG domain. It is ubiquitously expressed with predominant occurrence in human pancreas, heart, brain, and placenta. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that BAG-4 interacts with Hsc70/Hsp90 in HepG2 cells. BAG-4 tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) or FLAG was localized both in cytoplasm of mouse BNLCL.2 liver cells and human liver hepatoma HepG2 cells. After heat shock, GFP-BAG-4 co-localizes with Hsc70 in the nucleus in HepG2 cells, whereas GFP-BAG-4 mutants lacking the BAG domain remain perinuclear. BAG-4 has no effects on apoB mRNA editing in vitro. However, unlike other apobec-1 complementation factors studied to date, antisense knockdown of BAG-4 in BNLCL.2 cells and in MCR-RH7777 cells increases rather than decreases endogenous apoB mRNA editing. Overexpression of BAG-4 in MCR-RH7777 cells also suppresses apoB mRNA editing. ApoB-48 production also increases with antisense BAG-4 expression in MCR-RH7777 cells. We previously showed that apoB mRNA editing is an intranuclear event (Lau, P. P., Xiong, W. J., Zhu, H. J., Chen, S. H., and Chan, L. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 20550-20554). Thus, BAG-4 overexpression down-regulates apoB mRNA editing by shuttling apobec-1 from the intranuclear perinucleolar compartment to the cytoplasm. We propose that BAG-4 functions as a negative regulator for apobec-1-mediated apoB mRNA editing through its ability to suppress the Hsp/Hsc70 chaperone activity and thereby editosome formation and, as a consequence, prevents nuclear localization of the apobec-1 editosome. Apobec-1 is the catalytic subunit of a multicomponent editosome complex that mediates apolipoprotein B (apoB) mRNA editing.

Apobec-1 is the catalytic subunit of an editosome complex that mediates apoB mRNA editing (2Chan L. Chang B.H. Liao W. Oka K. Lau P.P. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2000; 55PubMed Google Scholar). There are three regions in the primary structure of apobec-1 that have been postulated to be important in its distribution in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. However, none of these experimentally meet the functional criteria of nuclear localization or nuclear export signals. Residues 97-172 in the middle of apobec-1 together with its N-terminal 56 residues modulate nuclear localization. Mutagenesis experiments, however, revealed no discrete nuclear localization signal in apobec-1. Fifteen amino acids (Leu173-Leu187) within the C-terminal domain of apobec-1 were sufficient as a determinant for cytoplasmic distribution. These residues failed to demonstrate nuclear export function in a reporter assay. Leptomycin B, an inhibitor for substrate recognition by CRM1, did not abolish the dual nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution of apobec-1 in MCR-RH7777 cells. Thus, it was proposed that interactions with chaperones play a key role in the intracellular distribution of apobec-1 and in nuclear editing (3Yang Y. Sowden M.P. Smith H.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Molecular chaperones of the Hsp70 family play an important role in the folding, refolding, translocation, and degradation of proteins in eukaryotic cells (4Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2791) Google Scholar). The mammalian chaperone proteins comprise multiple members; Hsp72 is the inducible form, and Hsp73 (or cognate) is the constitutive form. Earlier we reported that an Hsp40/DnaJ protein, ABBP-2, also called DnaJb11, is involved in eukaryotic mRNA editing (5Lau P.P. Villanueva H. Kobayashi K. Nakamuta M. Chang B.H. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46445-46452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A major role of the J domain of DnaJ proteins appears to be the recruitment of Hsp70 to a specific polypeptide substrate for cellular functions. We found that down-regulation of ABBP-2 abolished endogenous apoB mRNA editing in apobec-1-expressing HepG2 cells and mouse liver BNLCL.2 cells and that ABBP-2 works in concert with Hsc70 (5Lau P.P. Villanueva H. Kobayashi K. Nakamuta M. Chang B.H. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46445-46452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this report, we identify BAG-4 as a regulator of apoB mRNA editing by its interaction with apobec-1 in association with the chaperone, Hsc70. BAG-4 belongs to a family of BAG proteins, which share a common BAG domain, a conserved 45-amino acid region near their C termini that binds to Hsc70/Hsp70. Using Hsc70 as the bait, BAG-1 was the first BAG (Bcl2-associated athanogene) protein cloned from two-hybrid screening as a Bcl2-associated protein and was shown to regulate Hsp70 nucleotide exchange and ATPase activity in the same fashion as GrpE does in Escherichia coli (6Takayama S.

Other BAG family proteins, BAG-2, BAG-3, and BAG-4, were subsequently cloned by Hsc70 screening using the two-hybrid method. BAG-1, BAG-2, and BAG-3 also bind the ATPase domain of Hsc70 with high affinity and suppress Hsp70/Hsc70 chaperone activity in vitro (9Takayama S. Xie Z. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 781-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). BAG-3 and BAG-4 both bind to Hsp70 and Bcl2 (10Antoku K. Maser R.S. Scully Jr., W.J. Delach S.M. Johnson D.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 286: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). BAG-4, also known as SODD (silencer of death domains), binds to and inhibits signaling by tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (11Jiang Y. Woronicz J.D. Liu W. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1999; 283: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Moderate to high levels of BAG-4 mRNA transcript were detected in a variety of pancreatic cancer patient samples and cell lines (12Liao Q. Ozawa F. Friess H. Zimmermann A. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Kleeff J. Bèuchler M.W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), conferring to these cells resistance to tumor necrosis factor receptor 1. The antiapoptotic activities of BAG family proteins may be a result of their interactions with Hsc70/Hsp70 and/or binding to Bcl-2 (13Doong H. Vrailas A. Kohn E.C. Cancer Lett. 2002; 188: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition to these cellular functions, here we identify BAG-4/SODD as a negative regulator of apobec-1 function exerting an inhibitory effect on apoB mRNA editing. We demonstrate how BAG-4 interacts with Hsc70 to modulate apoB mRNA editing. Two-hybrid Cloning—Three of the five positive apobec-1-interacting clones that successfully passed the mating assay by failing to interact with nonspecific diploids were reported as two RNA-binding proteins, ABBP-1 (14Lau P.P.

Subsequently, a DnaJ type of co-chaperone, ABBP-2, was isolated from a human liver library (5Lau P.P. Villanueva H. Kobayashi K. Nakamuta M. Chang B.H. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46445-46452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Besides ABBP-2, another clone that was obtained from the human liver library (Clontech) contains a nearly full-length cDNA of a known chaperone regulator, named SODD or BAG-4 (11Jiang Y. Woronicz J.D. Liu W. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1999; 283: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Three codons were missing from the 5′ end of this BAG-4 cDNA clone, which were recovered by PCR subcloning, and the authenticity of the full-length BAG-4 cDNA was verified by sequencing. Biochemical Methods—Polyclonal antibodies to glutathione S-transferase (GST) 1The abbreviations used are: GSTglutathione S-transferaseCMVcytomegalovirusFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindoleACFapobec-1 complementation factorGFPgreen fluorescent protein.-BAG-4 fusion protein and human apobec-1 were raised in New Zealand White rabbits. These BAG-4 antibodies recognized a predominant band on Western blots of mouse S-100 extracts (100,000 × g supernatant). Northern blots of human tissues were purchased from Clontech. Hybridization was performed as previously described (15Lau P.P. Chang B.H. Chan L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (Clontech). After immobilization to glutathione beads, binding of GST-BAG-4 fusion protein to [35S]methionine-labeled apobec-1 was performed in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% Nonidet P-40 solution at 4 °C for 1 h in a rotary shaker as described previously (5Lau P.P.

Truncated GST-BAG-4 cDNAs were constructed into pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences) by PCR subcloning, and their sequences were verified.

Plasmids and Cell Culture Transfection—Full-length cDNAs of BAG-4 and human apobec-1 (17Lau P.P. Zhu H.J. Baldini A. Charnsangavej C. Chan L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8522-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) were subcloned in-frame into pFLAG-CMV-2 expression vector (Eastman Kodak Co.). BAG-4 and truncated BAG-4 mutants were cloned into pcDNA3.1/NT-GFP-TOPO (Invitrogen). Antisense DNAs of BAG-4, apobec-1 complementation factor (ACF), and ABBP-2 were subcloned into pHook-3 (Invitrogen). All subclones were verified by direct sequencing. A mouse liver BNLCL.2 cell line that stably expressed mouse apobec-1 and human hepatoma cell line HepG2 cells that stably expressed human apobec-1 (5Lau P.P. Villanueva H. Kobayashi K. Nakamuta M. Chang B.H. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46445-46452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were used for transfection. Transient transfection was performed with electroporation or LipofectAMINE. For pHook-3 transfection, the transfected cells were collected by hapten-coated magnetic beads. Besides the single chain antibody against a specific hapten, hemagglutinin A epitope tag and Myc epitope tag were preceded by a signal peptide and co-expressed by the Rous sarcoma virus promoter contained in pHook-3; a CMV promoter was used for expressing the inserted DNA. 12-mm poly-l-lysine coverslips (Becton Dickinson) or collagen-coated cover slips were used for BNLCL.2 cells and HepG2 cells, respectively. After 48 h, cells were fixed by paraformaldehyde, and antibody staining was done at room temperature for 30 min and detected by Rhodamine Red-conjugated second rabbit antibody or by MOM fluorescence kit (Vector Laboratories Inc.) In parallel experiments after 48 h, cells were harvested, and RNA was extracted for reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification for apoB mRNA. Gel-purified fragments of apoB were used for dideoxy-G reverse transcriptase editing assays as described (5Lau P.P. Villanueva H. Kobayashi K. Nakamuta M. Chang B.H. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46445-46452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Structure of BAG-4—Using human apobec-1 cDNA as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified a cloned cDNA for another interacting protein besides ABBP-2 from a human liver library; both clones successfully passed the mating assay. The clone obtained was searched with BLAST and revealed a previously published sequence annotated as SODD or BAG-4. The two-hybrid clone contained all but the first three codons. The predicted protein structure of BAG-4 has a BAG domain in the carboxyl-terminal region (Fig. 1A) but lacks the ubiquitin domain present in BAG-1 or the WW domain present in BAG-3. It contains 458 amino acid residues and has a predicted subunit molecular mass of 49.59 kDa. The secondary structure of BAG-4 and the BAG-Hsc70 complex is well characterized (18Sondermann H. Scheufler C. Schneider C. Hohfeld J. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Science. 2001; 291: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of a complex with the ATPase of Hsc70, the BAG domain forms a three-helix bundle, inducing a conformational switch in the ATPase that is incompatible with nucleotide binding in the same fashion as observed in bacterial Hsp70 homologue, DnaK, upon binding of the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE. The tertiary structure of the three helices of the BAG domain as determined by NMR in solution was obtained from a VAST search (Fig. 1A). The second and third helices interact with the ATP-binding pocket of Hsc70/Hsp70. The BAG domain and GrpE of E. coli are structurally unrelated (18Sondermann H. Scheufler C. Schneider C. Hohfeld J. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Science. 2001; 291: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). However, they both interact with the same ATPase subdomains of their respective Hsp70 or DnaK. Tissue Distribution—One criterion for identifying candidate proteins involved in the apoB mRNA editing process is their presence in the tissues actively expressing editing activity. BAG-4 mRNA is present in multiple human tissues including the liver and small intestine as shown on the poly(A) mRNA Northern blots (Fig. 1B). In humans, apoB mRNA editing occurs exclusively in the small intestine, which is also the exclusive tissue for the existence of apobec-1 (17Lau P.P. Zhu H.J. Baldini A. Charnsangavej C. Chan L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8522-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). BAG-4 is a molecular chaperone regulator and participates in various cellular functions, and its universal existence is not unexpected. BAG-4 Interacts with Apobec-1 at the N Terminus—The full-length human BAG-4 cDNA and different deletion mutants were subcloned into pGEX-4T2. The GST fusion proteins of BAG-4 of different lengths were used for an in vitro binding assay (Fig. 2A) to verify the in vivo interaction of BAG-4 and apobec-1 observed in the two-hybrid screening. Nine mutants of progressive deletion of the C-terminal region and the N-terminal region were used to examine the role of the different parts of BAG-4 that are involved in apobec-1 binding. We found that mutants (mu1-5) lacking the BAG domain still bind to apobec-1 essentially as well as the full-length BAG-4. Only when the P/G-rich region of the N terminus was deleted was there a significant attenuation of apobec-1 binding. The apobec-1 binding region of ABBP-1 is proline-rich (14Lau P.P. Zhu H.J. Nakamuta M. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1452-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Proline-rich motifs are commonly involved in protein-protein interaction, and proline-rich sequences are commonly found in situations requiring the rapid recruitment or interchange of several proteins, such as during initiation of transcription and signal cascades (19Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). It was postulated that the nonconserved N-terminal regions of BAG proteins target proteins to their right partners. The C-terminal BAG domain is used for Hsc70/Hsp70 binding in the presence of ATP and its co-chaperone, ABBP-2, and subsequently releases Hsc70-bound substrate and ADP. Apobec-1 Editosome Is Localized in the Perinucleolar Compartment—Human liver HepG2 cells contain no apobec-1 and are incapable of apoB mRNA editing. We introduced apobec-1 into HepG2 cells by transient transfection of pCMV-FLAG-apobec-1 plasmid and examined hundreds of cells. In all cells examined, the presence of apobec-1 was detected by rabbit polyclonal anti-apobec-1 antibodies coupled with Rhodamine Red anti-rabbit IgG second antibodies (Fig. 3A). The intracellular localization of the protein is identical to that detected by the mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (M5) antibodies as visualized by fluorescence anti-mouse IgG antibodies. The two images completely overlapped. Thus, by using these two different antibodies, we determined that apobec-1 was predominantly nuclear (Fig. 3A). Apobec-1 was also found similarly located predominantly in the nucleus in (rat liver) MCR-RH7777 cells and apobec-1-transfected (mouse liver) BNLCL.2 cells. This finding is consistent with our earlier observation that apoB mRNA editing is a predominantly intranuclear event (1Lau P.P. Xiong W.J. Zhu H.J. Chen S.H. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20550-20554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon close observation of the apobec-1-expressing HepG2 cells, we found that apobec-1 is absent from the nucleoli but is localized exclusively in the nucleoplasm with enrichment in the perinucleolar region (Fig. 3B). A similar observation was obtained in MCR-RH7777 cells (Fig. 3B). The perinucleolar compartment is involved in RNA metabolism including splicing and polyadenylation (20Huang S. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); it is also where other apobec-1 auxiliary factors, such as KSRP, CUG-BP, and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins, are located predominantly (20Huang S. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 21Huang S. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Spector D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 35-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). KSRP is a splicing regulatory protein. CUG-BP is a poly(A)-binding protein. Deletion mutagenesis studies showed that at least three RNA recognition motifs at either the carboxyl or amino end of the polypyrimidine binding proteins are required to target the protein to the perinucleolar compartment, suggesting that RNA binding is needed for such intracellular localization. These RNA-binding proteins were previously found to be involved in apoB mRNA editing (22Lellek H. Kirsten R. Diehl I. Apostel F. Buck F. Greeve J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19848-19856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 23Anant S. Henderson J.O. Mukhopadhyay D. Navaratnam N. Kennedy S. Min J. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47338-47351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and apoB mRNA editing was coincidental with splicing and polyadenylation (1Lau P.P. Xiong W.J. Zhu H.J. Chen S.H. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20550-20554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Besides apobec-1, it is of interest to localize the ACF, the only RNA-binding protein that was reported to enhance apoB RNA editing in vitro (16Mehta A. Kinter M.T. Sherman N.E. Driscoll D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1846-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). A polyclonal rabbit antibody against ACF (a gift from Dr. Donna Driscoll) was used to detect its intracellular localization in HepG2 cells, BNLCL.2 cells, and MCR-RH7777 cells; in contrast to apobec-1, which is predominantly in the nucleus, ACF is localized in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments (Fig. 3C, top panel) in HepG2 cells and BNLCL.2 cells but predominantly nuclear and nonnucleolar (Fig. 3C, bottom panel) in MCR-RH7777 cells. According to observations in other laboratories, ACF intracellular localization varies from cytoplasmic to nuclear in different cell lines and varies according to the antibodies used and whether or not it is tagged with epitopes (24Yang Y. Sowden M.P. Smith H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22663-22669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 25Blanc V. Navaratnam N. Henderson J.O. Anant S. Kennedy S. Jarmuz A.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3971-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). When ACF was tagged with c-Myc epitope in CCL13 (a HeLa cell derivative), ACF was predominately localized in the cytoplasm (28Chester A. Somasekaram A. Tzimina M. Jarmuz A. Gisbourne J. O'Keefe R. Scott J. Navaratnam N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3971-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). When ACF is nuclearly localized, the putative nuclear localization signal motif in ACF may not be responsible for its nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking, since the nuclear import of apobec-1 may depend on protein-protein interaction (26Blanc V. Henderson J.O. Kennedy S. Davidson N.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46386-46393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic Localization of BAG-4—We have previously constructed a HepG2 cell line stably expressing apobec-1 with an apoB mRNA editing activity of about 30% (17Lau P.P. Zhu H.J. Baldini A. Charnsangavej C. Chan L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8522-8526Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). BAG-4 was not readily detectable with the rabbit polyclonal antibodies in HepG2 cells, although it was faintly detected in the cytoplasmic compartment in all of the cells examined. BAG proteins (BAG-1) are generally not abundant, at least 10-fold less than HIP (Hsp-interacting protein), so as to allow Hsc70 to fulfill its expanded spectrum of cellular functions (7Hèohfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). In order to more clearly ascertain the localization of BAG-4, we transfected pCMV-FLAG2-BAG-4 cDNA and pcDNA3.1NT-GFP-BAG-4 into this cell line. BAG-4 was detected in the cytoplasmic compartment (Fig. 4A), although occasionally we detected GFP-BAG-4 in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments when it was overly expressed. We also transfected GFP-BAG-4 into a mouse liver cell line BNLCL.2 that stably expressed apobec-1, producing about 50% apoB mRNA editing (5Lau P.P. Villanueva H. Kobayashi K. Nakamuta M. Chang B.H. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46445-46452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). GFP-BAG-4 was localized predominantly in the cytoplasm with some enrichment in the perinuclear region (Fig. 4B). Similarly, BAG-1 and BAG-1M were mostly located in the cytoplasm but were occasionally found in the nucleus, depending on the cell type and whether the cells were exposed to stress conditions (13Doong H. Vrailas A. Kohn E.C. Cancer Lett. 2002; 188: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Association of BAG-4 with Hsp70 and Hsp90 in HepG2 Cells—It is known that BAG-4 binds to both forms of Hsp70, Hsc70 (Hsp73), the constitutive form of heat shock protein 70, and Hsp72, the inducible form (18Sondermann H. Scheufler C. Schneider C. Hohfeld J. Hartl F.U. Moarefi I. Science. 2001; 291: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). We have previously characterized ABBP-2 (DnaJb11) and its association with the constitutive form of the Hsp70, Hsc70, in HepG2 cells. In this study, we ascertained Hsp70 association with BAG-4 in these cells. We transfected HepG2 cells with FLAG-BAG-4 and prepared S-100 extracts from them; we then performed an immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody beads. Indeed, we detected Hsc70 with an Hsc70-specific antibody in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 5A). Conversely, an antibody to apobec-1 also pulled down BAG-4 (Fig. 5A). Similarly, Hsp70 was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody against BAG-4 (Fig. 5B). In the same immunoprecipitate, Hsp90 was also detected with a monoclonal antibody against Hsp90 (Fig. 5B). Thus, these pull-down experiments suggest that BAG-4 associates with Hsp70 and Hsp90 as well as with apobec-1 inside HepG2 cells. BAG-1 regulates Hsc70 in a manner opposite to that of HIP (7Hèohfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), which stabilizes the ADP-bound state of Hsc70 and inhibits ATPase activity of Hsc70. BAG proteins are known to stimulate Hsc70 ATPase activity in the presence of a J-protein. Hence, we investigated the effect of BAG-4 acting as a nucleotide exchange factor. In Fig. 5C, we showed that ABBP-2 stimulates Hsc70 ATPase activity and that the addition of BAG-4 enhances the effect of ABBP-2. BAG-4 Is an Hsp70 Co-chaperone—Previously, we showed that the Hsc70/ABBP-2 pair was involved in modulating apoB mRNA editing in vivo (5Lau P.P. Villanueva H. Kobayashi K. Nakamuta M. Chang B.H. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46445-46452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). ABBP-2 is a co-chaperone DnaJ protein. The orthodox members of DnaJ subfamily Dj2 and Dj3 have J, G/F, and zinc finger domains and are farnesylated, whereas Dj1 (Hsp40/Hdj-1) and ABBP-2 are noncanonical members that lack the zinc finger domain and the prenylation motif. The BAG-1 protein stimulates refolding of denatured proteins of Hsc70/Dj2 and Hsc70/Dj3 pairs but is not effective with Hsc70/Dj1. BAG-1, BAG-2, and BAG-3 were also reported to suppress chaperone activity of Hsc70 (7Hèohfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 29Bimston D. Song J. Winchester D. Takayama S. Reed J.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6871-6878Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It was further shown that Hsc70/Dj2 and Hsc70/Dj3 do not translocate into the nucleus and remain cytoplasmic and perinuclear after heat shock, whereas the Hsc70/Dj1 pair translocates inside the nucleus and accumulates in the nucleolus (30Terada K. Mori M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24728-24734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The fact that apobec-1 interacts with both ABBP-2 and BAG-4 has prompted us to investigate whether BAG-4 is a co-chaperone of the Hsc70/ABBP-2 pair. After heat shock, BAG-4 enters the nucleus in HepG2 cells (Fig. 6A). Since the BAG domain is required to suppress Hsc70 chaperone activity, we transfected BAG-4 mutant (mu2) that lacks a functional BAG domain with helix 2 partially deleted and helix 3 totally deleted. The transfected cells were then subjected to heat shock. As expected, BAG-4-mu2 remained perinuclear and cytoplasmic after heat shock (Fig. 6C). In the same mu2-transfected HepG2 cells, Hsc70 was still able to enter the nucleus and nucleolus (Fig. 6B). Thus, BAG-4 is a co-chaperone of Hsc70 and is totally dependent on its BAG domain for its interaction with Hsc70 so that it can move into the nucleus with the latter after heat shock. Down-regulation of BAG-4 Increases apoB mRNA Editing in Vivo—One criterion to qualify a candidate protein to be an auxiliary factor is that alteration in its expression changes apoB mRNA editing. In all cases studied with one exception to date, down-regulation of the auxiliary factors inhibits apoB mRNA editing in vivo. This was true for ABBP-1 (14Lau P.P. Zhu H.J. Nakamuta M. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1452-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), ABBP-2 (5Lau P.P. Villanueva H. Kobayashi K. Nakamuta M. Chang B.H. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46445-46452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and ACF (5Lau P.P. Villanueva H. Kobayashi K. Nakamuta M. Chang B.H. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46445-46452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In one case (GRY-RBP), 2P. P. Lau and L. Chan, unpublished data. there was no effect. Contrary to these previous examples, we found that antisense down-regulation of BAG-4 enhances editing in BNLCL.2-apobec-1-expressing cells. In Fig. 7A, the bound fraction in the Capture-Tec pHook-3 system represents the enriched fraction of antisense BAG-4 DNA-transfected cells; in these cells, editing increased from 50% (mock control in Fig. 7A, lanes 1 and 2) to almost completion, 98% (Fig. 7A, lanes 3-6). This observation indicates that BAG-4 is an inhibitor of apoB mRNA editing in vivo. This is consistent with the hypothesis that BAG-4 inhibits the assembly of apobec-1-editosome in the presence of the Hsc70/ABBP-2 pair. In contrast and consistent with previous observations, we found that antisense DNAs to ACF and ABBP-2 knocked down the endogenous apoB mRNA editing from 55% to 2.5 and 5%, respectively, in BNLCL.2-apobec-1-expressing cells (Fig. 7A, lanes 7-9). We also tested the effects of antisense BAG-4 cDNA expression in MCA-RH7777 rat hepatoma cells that naturally expressed apobec-1 and displayed about 45% apoB mRNA editing. In these cells, expression of antisense BAG-4 cDNA by transfection increased endogenous apoB mRNA editing from 45 to 96% (Fig. 7B, lanes 1 and 2). On the other hand, overexpression of sense BAG-4 DNA suppressed editing from 40% down to ∼5% (Fig. 7B, lanes 3-5). To further verify this in vivo effect and the downstream effect of BAG-4 down-regulation, we labeled the cellular proteins in MCR-RH7777 cells with [35S]methionine. SDS-PAGE analysis of the 35S-labeled apoB immunoprecipitate showed an increase in the amount of [35S]apoB-48 relative to [35S]apoB-100 (from 44 ± 12.8% (S.D.) to 76 ± 15.3%, p = 0.0500) in extracts isolated from the antisense BAG-4 cDNA-transfected cells compared with those from mock-transfected cells (Fig. 7C). This observation confirms that down-regulation of BAG-4 increases endogenous editing. Interestingly, when we co-incubated purified BAG-4 with apobec-1-expressing S-100 extract from HepG2 cells, we observed no effect on in vitro editing (Fig. 7D). The data suggest that the effect of BAG-4 on editing in vivo is indirect and probably involves the targeting of apobec-1 and other required proteins to the right partner and/or cellular compartment for editing to occur through regulation of Hsp70 or other chaperones. Shuttling of Apobec-1 to the Cytoplasm by BAG-4 Overexpression—We found strong evidence for the role of BAG-4 in apobec-1 trafficking (Fig. 8). When BAG-4 was overexpressed, apobec-1 was shuttled to the cytoplasmic compartment in MCR-RH7777 cells (Fig. 8A). Apobec-1 was predominantly localized in the nucleus and changed dramatically to the cytoplasmic compartment after transfection by pHook-3-BAG-4 sense DNA. Similarly, overexpression of BAG-4 in BNLCL.2-apobec-1-expressing cells facilitated apobec-1 export from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Fig. 8B). Apobec-1 was localized in the nucleus in the extranucleolar compartment in BNLCL2-apobec-1 cells and was exported drastically to the cytoplasm after transfection with pCMV2-FLAG-BAG-4 sense DNA. The appearance of speckles in the cytoplasm may represent the apobec-1 aggregates in cells with the chaperone regulator overly expressed. To date, by two-hybrid cloning using human apobec-1 as bait, our laboratory has identified two RNA-binding proteins, ABBP-1 and GRY-RBP (14Lau P.P. Zhu H.J. Nakamuta M. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1452-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 15Lau P.P. Chang B.H. Chan L. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 2001; 276: 46445-46452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and Bag-4. Other RNA-binding proteins, such as ACF (ASP), KSRP (16Mehta A. Kinter M.T. Sherman N.E.

In this study, we have further localized apobec-1 in the perinucleolar compartment (Fig. 3B). We note that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein, KSRP, and CUGBP are also preferentially localized in this compartment (20Huang S. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The perinucleolar compartment is a highly dynamic structure; for example, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis revealed a rapid turnover of the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein within this compartment (21Huang S.

There is evidence indicating that the perinucleolar compartment is actively involved in RNA metabolism (20Huang S. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 129: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Deletion mutagenesis analysis showed that at least three RNA recognition motifs are required for the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein to be targeted to the perinucleolar compartment (31Kaminski A. Jackson R.J. RNA. 1998; 4: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The identified auxiliary proteins of the apobec-1-editosome, including ABBP-1, GRY-BP, KSRP, and ACF, each contain two or three RNA recognition motifs. Many of them were identified by UV cross-linking to the AU-rich apoB mRNA. Taken together, we speculate that regulated apoB mRNA editing also occurs in the perinucleolar compartment. Here we further showed that BAG-4 regulates apobec-1-mediated editing through its interaction with Hsc70 and Hsp90. This finding is consistent with our earlier identification of ABBP-2, a DnaJ co-chaperone protein that works with Hsc70, and their involvement in regulating apoB mRNA editing through their interaction with apobec-1. ABBP-2 acts as a positive regulator by stimulating chaperone activity of Hsc70 and therefore is required for apobec-1 editosome assembly in the presence of HIP by causing a slow ADP release (Fig. 9A). In Fig. 9A, we depict the possible role of the various co-chaperone proteins involved in apobec-1 editosome assembly and transport. In the presence of ATP, Hsc70 and DnaJ (ABBP-2) mediate the assembly of the apobec-1 editosome before it is imported into the nucleus. In the presence of Hsp90 and HOP (hsp-organizing protein), Hsp90 may assist in the import of apobec-1 into the nucleus. BAG-4 acts as a chaperone regulator by binding to the ATPase domain of Hsc70 N-terminal region, dissociating the Hsp90-editosome complex. This is analogous to the previous findings that BAG-1 regulates p53 stabilization and subcellular localization (8King F.W. Wawrzynow A. Hèohfeld J. Zylicz M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6297-6305Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and that Hsp90 may assist p53 import into the nucleus by exposing its nuclear localization signal (32Zylicz M. King F.W. Wawrzynow A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4634-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Overexpression of BAG-4 would facilitate both the stabilization and cytoplasmic sequestration of apobec-1 aggregates (Fig. 8B). BAG domain proteins stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc70 in an Hsp40/Dnaj-dependent manner (Fig. 5C) and in this way induce the release of substrates from Hsc70. Efficient interaction of Hsc70 with a polypeptide depends on the conversion of bound ATP to ADP (7Hèohfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Only the ADP-bound form confers stable substrate binding (33Minami Y. Hèohfeld J. Ohtsuka K. Hartl F.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19617-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). By accelerating substrate release, the half-life of the Hsp70-substrate complex is decreased (7Hèohfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Therefore, BAG proteins suppress Hsc70 chaperone refolding activity. Indeed, it was shown in a comparative study (including human BAG-1, BAG-2, BAG-3, BAG-4, and BAG-5) that BAG proteins, which functioned as a competitive antagonist of the co-chaperone, HIP, inhibited restoration of denatured luciferase activity by Hsc70/DnaJ in vitro (9Takayama S. Xie Z. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 781-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Our finding is consistent with the model of BAG-4 acting as a negative regulator of the Hsc70/ABBP-2 pair in suppressing Hsc70 chaperone activity by interfering with HIP in stabilizing the Hsc70-ADP-substrate complex, and, as a consequence, BAG-4 is a negative regulator for apobec-1-editosome assembly by speeding up ADP release and subsequently inhibits apobec-1-mediated editing as shown in Fig. 7, A-C. However, the exact network of competing and cooperating cofactors of the Hsc70 or Hsp90 chaperone system that modulates the assembly of editosome and intracellular localization needs further investigation when all of the components are identified and specific antibodies against them become available. We, however, postulate that the possible roles of BAG-4 and ABBP-2 play are their competitive and noncompetitive binding with HIP and HOP to Hsc70 in its N-terminal and C-terminal binding domains, respectively (Fig. 9B). We propose this hypothesis based on the fact that the modulation of chaperone activity of Hsc70 involves cooperation with Hsp40 (a J-domain protein); BAG-1; the Hsc70-interacting protein, HIP; and the Hsc70-Hsp90-organizing protein, HOP. It is also known that HOP and Hsp40 bind to the carboxyl terminus of Hsc70 in a noncompetitive manner, whereas Bag-1 and HIP compete in binding to Hsc70 at the amino-terminal ATPase domain (34Demand J. Lèuders J. Hèohfeld J. Zmbh Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). It is not surprising that the multitasking housekeeping chaperone system is involved in regulating the highly precise and targeted editing of a specific glutamine codon on the pre-mRNA of apoB in the nucleus so that potentially harmful, uncontrolled, promiscuous RNA editing in the cytoplasm can be prevented. Our report on the regulation of RNA editing by molecular chaperones is unique in uncovering the fact that Hsc70 and Hsp90 chaperone system modulates apoB mRNA editing by utilizing a positive regulator, the J-protein ABBP-2 (5Lau P.P. Villanueva H. Kobayashi K. Nakamuta M. Chang B.H. Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46445-46452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and a negative regulator BAG-4 (this report) to control apobec-1 editosome assembly and its subcellular localization.

https://openalex.org/W2050814038,"A secreted 450-kDa complex of proteins called counting factor (CF) is part of a negative feedback loop that regulates the size of the groups formed by developing <i>Dictyostelium</i> cells. Two components of CF are countin and CF50. Both recombinant countin and recombinant CF50 decrease group size in <i>Dictyostelium. countin</i><sup>-</sup> cells have a decreased cAMP-stimulated cAMP pulse, whereas recombinant countin potentiates the cAMP pulse. We find that <i>cf50</i><sup>-</sup> cells have an increased cAMP pulse, whereas recombinant CF50 decreases the cAMP pulse, suggesting that countin and CF50 have opposite effects on cAMP signal transduction. In addition, countin and CF50 have opposite effects on cAMP-stimulated Erk2 activation. However, like recombinant countin, recombinant CF50 increases cell motility. We previously found that cells bind recombinant countin with a Hill coefficient of ∼2, a <i>K</i><sub>H</sub> of 60 pm, and ∼53 sites/cell. We find here that cells also bind <sup>125</sup>I-recombinant CF50, with a Hill coefficient of ∼2, a <i>K</i><sub>H</sub> of ∼15 ng/ml (490 pm), and ∼56 sites/cell. Countin and CF50 require each other's presence to affect group size, but the presence of countin is not necessary for CF50 to bind to cells, and CF50 is not necessary for countin to bind to cells. Our working hypothesis is that a signal transduction pathway activated by countin binding to cells modulates a signal transduction pathway activated by CF50 binding to cells and <i>vice versa</i> and that these two pathways can be distinguished by their effects on cAMP signal transduction."

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in hematopoiesis, regulation of immune responses, and the acute phase reaction (2.Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M.

This cytokine belongs to the family of interleukin-6-type cytokines that includes interleukin-11 (IL-11), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), oncostatin M (OSM), and cardiotrophin like factor. All of these cytokines share the characteristic four-helix bundle protein fold (6.Sprang S.R. Bazan J.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 815-827Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). This family of proteins signals via receptor complexes, which contain at least one molecule of gp130, the common signal transducing protein of the IL-6-type family of cytokines (3.Grötzinger J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). IL-6 and IL-11 act via a homodimer of gp130, whereas CNTF, CT-1, LIF, and OSM induce a signaling event via the heterodimerization of gp130 and LIFR. Alternatively, OSM recruits gp130 and the OSM receptor. On target cells, IL-6, IL-11, and CNTF first bind to their specific α-receptor subunits, IL-6R, IL-11R, and CNTFR, respectively, which are not involved in the intracellular signal transduction cascade (3.Grötzinger J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These membrane-bound α-receptors can be functionally replaced by their soluble forms, which lack transmembrane and cytoplasmic parts (7.Jones S. Rose-John S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been shown recently that CNTF not only interacts with CNTFR but also with the IL-6R (8.Schuster B. Kovaleva M. Sun Y. Regenhard P. Matthews V. Grötzinger J. Rose-John S. Kallen K.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9528-9535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). All receptors of the IL-6-type cytokines belong to the cytokine receptor class I family characterized by the presence of at least one cytokine receptor homology (CRH) region consisting of two FN domains (6.Sprang S.R. Bazan J.F. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 815-827Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The conserved CRH plays a central role in cytokine recognition by the receptor. The N-terminal FN domain of the CRH contains four conserved cysteine residues, whereas the C-terminal FN domain is characterized by a tryptophan-serine-X-tryptophan-serine (WSXWS) sequence motif. The extracellular part of the IL-6R consists of an Ig domain (D1) and one CRH (D2 and D3). It is the C-terminal domain of IL-6R and IL-11R of the corresponding CRH that are primarily responsible for ligand binding, since these domains have been shown to account for more than 90% of the binding energy (9.Özbek S.

In addition, the crystal structure (3.65 Å resolution) of the hexameric IL-6·IL-6R·gp130 complex has recently been published (14.Boulanger M.J. Chow D.-C. Brevnova E.E. Garcia K.C. Science. 2003; 300: 2101-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). A number of amino acid residues of IL-6 and IL-6R involved at the interaction interface have been defined by mutational studies (15.Kalai M. Montero-Julian F.A. Grötzinger J. Fontaine V.

Chow D.-C. Brevnova E.E. Garcia K.C. Science. 2003; 300: 2101-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Using chemical shift mapping in combination with the current structural data the amino acid residues of IL-6R that are key in the interaction with its cognate cytokine are detailed. The results confirm the conclusions drawn from previous mutagenesis studies and clearly indicate that structural rearrangement of the IL-6R-D3 is required to induce the correct interaction between this domain and its cognate cytokine. In contrast, the NMR results presented do not entirely translate to the recent crystal structure of the complex and indicate that such structural rearrangements are not fully accounted for in the current complex model. Protein Expression and Purification—Unlabeled interleukin-6 was expressed and purified as described previously (17.Arcone R. Arpaia G. Ruoppolo M. Malorni A. Pucci P. Marino G. Ialenti A. Di Rosa M.

The third domain of IL-6R was expressed using the BL21(DE3)pLysS Escherichia coli strain, refolded, and purified as described previously (9.Özbek S. Grötzinger J. Krebs B. Fischer M. Wollmer A.

NMR Sample Preparation—After purification protein concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy. Unlabeled IL-6 was mixed with the 15N-labeled IL-6R-D3 in a molar ratio of 1:1. This sample was concentrated using an Amicon stirring cell (Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) to a final concentration of about 0.5 mm in 20 mm phosphate buffer at pH 5.0 containing 95% H2O/5% D2O and used to record two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra. NMR Spectroscopy—The NMR sample of the complex consisted of a 0.5 mm 1:1 complex of 15N-enriched IL-6R-D3·IL-6, 20 mm sodium phosphate in 260 μl of 95% H2O/5% D2O, pH 5.0. The NMR sample of 15N-enriched IL-6R-D3 was prepared in identical buffer conditions. All NMR data were acquired at 20 °C on a Varian Inova Unity 600 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a z axis pulsed-field gradient 1H/15N/13C probe optimized for 1H detection. Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC experiments were recorded with the insensitive nuclei enhanced by polarization transfer delay set to 2.25 ms as a compromise between the fast relaxing amide protons and the optimal transfer time for the 1JNH couplings of ∼90 Hz. The recycle delay was 1.3 s. The data matrix consisted of 128* × 384* data points (where n* refers to complex points) with acquisition times of 61 (tN) and 96 ms (tHN). A total of 32 scans per complex tN increment was collected. The total measuring time for each experiment was 1.6 h. The experiment was performed with the 1H carrier positioned in the center of the amide proton frequency (7.52 ppm) and the 15N carrier at 118.4 ppm. 15N decoupling was applied during data acquisition. Sequence-specific backbone assignments of IL-6R-D3 were achieved 2A. Schwantner, A. J. Dingley, S. Özbek, O. Hecht, S. Rose-John, and J.

Proton chemical shifts were referenced with respect to 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate, while 13C and 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly using the gyromagnetic ratios of 13C:1H (0.251449530) and 15N:1H (0.101329118), respectively. All data were processed using the nmrPipe software package (18.Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

The two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the IL-6R-D3 is presented in Fig. 1A. The sequence-specific 1H-15N assignment of IL-6R-D3 was derived from a series of three-dimensional triple resonance experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”) and resonances are labeled with assignment information. The chemical shift index (CSI) is a simple and reliable statistical method to predict secondary structure elements from recorded chemical shifts by comparison with their corresponding random coil values (20.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar, 21.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar). From the calculated CSI values derived from the 1HN, 1Hα, 13Cα, and 13Cβ chemical shifts a consensus CSI value can be determined that allows the identification of α-helical, β-strand, or coiled structures by indices of -1, +1, or 0, respectively (20.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar, 21.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar). The third domain of the extracellular part of IL-6R has been predicted to share a fibronectin type III-like fold consisting of seven β-strands that has been recently confirmed by the x-ray structure of the extracellular part of the IL-6R (13.Varghese J.N.

The chemical shifts of 1HN, 1Hα, 15N, 13Cα, and 13Cβ nuclei of the IL-6R-D3 were derived from the following set of experiments: two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC, three-dimensional HBHA(CBCACO)NH, three-dimensional CBCA(CO)NH, three-dimensional CBCANH, and three-dimensional HNCA spectra. Chemical shift indexing was performed with the 1HN, 1Hα, 13Cα, and 13Cβ chemical shifts to obtain an estimate of the secondary structure of the IL-6R-D3 (Fig. 1B). Of the expected seven β-strands observed in the crystal structure, six β-strands were estimated from the CSI values. Only the short β-strand G was not clearly identified. The CSI results agree with the lengths of the β-strands determined in the x-ray structure (13.Varghese J.N. Moritz R.L. Lou M.Z. Van Donkelaar A. Ji H. Ivancic N. Branson K.M. Hall N.E. Simpson R.J.

Apparently, the shorter β-strand C is due to the absence of assignment data for the 1Hα and 13Cβ of Glu-235 due to spectral overlap.Fig. 1Sequential assignment of the third extracellular domain of the interleukin-6 receptor.A, two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the third extracellular domain of IL-6R acquired at 20 °C.

Differences of more than ± 0.1 ppm with respect to random coil values for the 1Hα, 1HN, 13Cα, and 13Cβ chemical shifts received an index value of +1 or -1. For the 1Hα chemical shifts, three consecutive positive (downfield shift) or four consecutive negative (upfield shift) indices designate β-strand or α-helical structures, respectively. 13Cβ chemical shifts can only be used to identify stretches of β-strands, and a grouping of four or more positive indices denotes such a secondary structure (20.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar, 21.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar). For the 1HN and 13Cα chemical shift values, three consecutive negative index values indicate that those residues form a β-strand, whereas four positive indices imply an α-helix (20.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1893) Google Scholar, 21.Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar). All other regions are designated as random coil or flexible regions of the protein. Residue numbers correspond to the full-length IL-6R.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The 1H and 15N chemical shifts of the resonances arising from the 15N-enriched IL-6R-D3·unlabeled IL-6 complex were compared with the 1H and 15N chemical shifts of the resonances arising from the unbound 15N-enriched IL-6R-D3. The majority of the resonances showed only minor or no chemical shift changes upon formation of the complex and were unambiguously assigned using the assignment data for the free IL-6R-D3. Such chemical shift changes are indicative that these residues of IL-6R-D3 are not located at the binding interface but are probably a reflection that binding of IL-6 causes subtle conformational changes to be transmitted through the protein to facilitate binding of IL-6. The much larger chemical shift changes or disappearance observed for some resonances abrogated the ability to unambiguously assign the full complement of resonances in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of IL-6R-D3 in complex with IL-6. The large shifts observed for these resonances are indicative of slow-to-intermediate exchange and strongly suggest that the binding of IL-6 to IL-6R-D3 has a low dissociation constant. This observation is supported by the measured ka and kd values of 2.72 × 104m-1 s-1 and 1.04 × 10-2 s-1, respectively (9.Özbek S. Grötzinger J. Krebs B. Fischer M. Wollmer A. Jostock T. Müllberg J. Rose-John S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21374-21379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although we were not able to reassign all the resonances that showed the largest shifts or disappeared, due to intermediate exchange, using the assignment data for the free IL-6R-D3 did provide unambiguous identification of those key residues located at the binding interface (see below for discussion). For a quantitative analysis of these data the normalized chemical shift differences were calculated. Fig. 2 shows the normalized chemical shift change for each residue of the IL-6R-D3 after binding to IL-6. Depending on the magnitude of the detected changes in the chemical shifts, residues were divided into two groups. The first group contains peaks that showed no or small changes in chemical shifts (<0.03 ppm). The second group contains peaks with a significantly larger chemical shift difference (>0.03 ppm). Chemical shift differences could not be calculated for some of the IL-6R-D3 residues, since their corresponding resonances in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the protein complex could not be unambiguously assigned. Although chemical shift differences were not calculated for these resonances, the residues were considered to be involved in the binding interface with IL-6. For some resonances (e.g. Asp-253 and Gln-272), nearby or overlapping peaks obscured accurate chemical shift measurements and were excluded from this analysis. Using the crystal structure of the IL-6R (13.Varghese J.N. Moritz R.L. Lou M.Z. Van Donkelaar A. Ji H. Ivancic N. Branson K.M. Hall N.E. Simpson R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15959-15964Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), the measured changes in the 1H and 15N chemical shifts of the amide groups were projected onto the structure of the third extracellular domain of this receptor with regions colored red indicating the largest changes observed (i.e. >0.03 ppm). As can be seen in Fig. 3A, changes in IL-6R-D3 conformation upon interacting with IL-6 occur predominately in the B/C, D/E, and F/G loops and the adjacent stretches in the corresponding β-strands. Interestingly, some significant chemical shift changes were observed on the opposite side of this domain in the E/F loop. Since a contact with the ligand can be excluded, this may indicate that upon binding IL-6 a slight structural displacement of one or both of the β-strands E and F results in a subsequent movement of the E/F loop to accommodate the displacement. The involvement of the B/C, D/E, and F/G loops in the binding interface with IL-6 has been predicted from model building and site-directed mutagenesis studies (15.Kalai M. Montero-Julian F.A.

Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1705-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These predictions are confirmed by the NMR data. Recently, the medium-resolution x-ray data of the IL-6·IL-6R·gp130 complex (14.Boulanger M.J. Chow D.-C. Brevnova E.E. Garcia K.C. Science. 2003; 300: 2101-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) coupled with high resolution structures of the single components, IL-6 (11.Somers W. Stahl M. Seehra J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 989-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), IL-6R (13.Varghese J.N. Moritz R.L. Lou M.Z. Van Donkelaar A. Ji H. Ivancic N. Branson K.M. Hall N.E. Simpson R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15959-15964Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and the three membrane-distal domains of gp130 (23.Chow D.-C. He X.-L. Snow A.L. Rose-John S. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 291: 2150-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) were used to create a model of the protein complex. Using this model, the authors suggested several residues in IL-6R to be involved in the interaction with IL-6. In Fig. 3B the crystal structure of the IL-6·IL-6R (D2 and D3) complex is shown. The crucial role of the residues Phe-229 and Tyr-230 in the B/C loop and Glu-278 and Phe-279 in the F/G loop for ligand binding has been demonstrated by site-directed mutagenesis (15.Kalai M. Montero-Julian F.A. Grötzinger J. Fontaine V. Vandenbussche P. Deschuyteneer R. Wollmer A. Brailly H. Content J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1319-1333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and was confirmed by the structure of the IL-6·IL-6R complex (14.Boulanger M.J. Chow D.-C. Brevnova E.E. Garcia K.C. Science. 2003; 300: 2101-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). According to this model Phe-229 (B/C loop) and Phe-279 (F/G loop) contribute 28 and 20%, respectively, to the total binding area (14.Boulanger M.J. Chow D.-C. Brevnova E.E. Garcia K.C. Science. 2003; 300: 2101-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Besides Phe-229, an apparent conformational change of the IL-6R-D3 was also observed for the adjacent residues in the B/C loop upon binding to its cognate cytokine. Chemical shift differences greater than 0.03 ppm were observed between residues Trp-225 (0.040 ppm) and Arg-231 (0.037 ppm). The resonances arising from the amide groups of Asn-226 to Tyr-230 either broadened due to intermediate chemical exchange or disappeared and reappeared due to slow exchange in the spectrum and were consequently not assigned in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the complex. Such changes clearly showed that these residues undergo conformational changes upon binding to IL-6. One of the significant differences between the crystal structure and our NMR data concerned Arg-233 (start of β-strand C). Arg-233 and the adjacent residues display chemical shift differences suggesting their involvement in IL-6 binding. In accordance with this observation are site-directed mutagenesis results that showed that Arg-233 plays an important role in binding to IL-6 (15.Kalai M. Montero-Julian F.A. Grötzinger J. Fontaine V. Vandenbussche P. Deschuyteneer R. Wollmer A. Brailly H. Content J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1319-1333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the crystal structure, this residue apparently does not participate in the interaction with IL-6 but has intramolecular contacts with main-chain atoms of residue Phe-297, which is one of the signature residues in the IL-6/IL-6R interface (14.Boulanger M.J. Chow D.-C. Brevnova E.E. Garcia K.C. Science. 2003; 300: 2101-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Therefore, the observed chemical shift difference of Arg-233 reflects a conformational change at the beginning of strand C rather than a direct involvement in ligand binding. The chemical shift mapping data revealed residues located in the D/E loop (Fig. 3A) to be influenced by ligand binding. The amino acid residues in this loop, especially Leu-254, Gln-255, His-256, and in addition Cys-258 (beginning of β-strand E), exhibit pronounced chemical shift differences (0.050, 0.048, 0.077, and 0.042, respectively), which are among the largest differences observed in this study. These observations are in excellent agreement with data derived from a site-directed mutagenesis studies (22.Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Natsuka S. Murakami M. Yamasaki K. Hibi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1705-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Yawata et al. (22.Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Natsuka S. Murakami M. Yamasaki K. Hibi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1705-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) reported that a double mutant Gln-255-Leu and His-256-Gln resulted in a decreased binding capacity of 39% compared with the wild type protein. These data are somewhat contradictory to what can be deduced from the crystal structure of the complex (14.Boulanger M.J. Chow D.-C. Brevnova E.E. Garcia K.C. Science. 2003; 300: 2101-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In this model, the D/E loop is far from the bound IL-6 with the shortest Cα-Cα distance of 11.9 Å (IL-6, Lys-27; IL-6R-D3, Asp-253). Furthermore, the side chains of the corresponding residues of IL-6-D3 D/E loop are not geometrically positioned in the crystal structure to be making opposite contacts with the bound IL-6. Like in the case of the B/C loop, the pronounced chemical shift differences observed in the D/E loop seem to indicate a more general conformational change rather than a direct involvement in the interaction with IL-6. Pronounced chemical shift differences were measured for resonances arising from residues located in the F/G loop (Fig. 3, A and B). This loop and the adjacent β-strands comprise the residues Gln-276 to Glu-283. This region contains Phe-279, which, in analogy to the human growth hormone receptor, is the hot spot residue that contributes the largest ligand binding energy (24.Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1764) Google Scholar). The Phe-279 → Ile mutation resulted in a complete loss of binding (22.Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Natsuka S. Murakami M. Yamasaki K. Hibi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1705-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). For this residue as well as the preceding one (Glu-278), no resonances could be unambiguously identified in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra. The missing assignment data of Glu-278 and Phe-279 of IL-6R-D3 are indicative of fast chemical exchange (i.e. conformational flexibility) in the unbound form. Both residues have been shown to be crucial for IL-6 binding (15.Kalai M. Montero-Julian F.A. Grötzinger J. Fontaine V. Vandenbussche P. Deschuyteneer R. Wollmer A. Brailly H. Content J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1319-1333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Natsuka S. Murakami M. Yamasaki K. Hibi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1705-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This loop also contains two glycines, Gly-280 and Gly-282. Mutagenesis of Gly-282 abolished binding to IL-6 completely (22.Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Natsuka S. Murakami M. Yamasaki K. Hibi M. Taga T. Kishimoto T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1705-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), reflecting the importance of this residue in the F/G loop. Since glycines are known to impart flexibility to loop regions, these two residues might also be responsible for the apparent flexibility of other residues in this loop. The measured chemical shift differences for the resonances corresponding to these two glycines are the largest measured (Fig. 2), indicating a distinct change in their chemical environment. These results imply an induced fit mechanism, in which the apparently flexible F/G loop adopts a specific rigid conformation upon IL-6 binding. Many cytokine receptors exhibit glycines at identical positions in the F/G loop (16.Grötzinger J. Kurapkat G. Wollmer A. Kalai M. Rose-John S. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 27: 96-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and the residues crucial for binding (hot spots) are also located in this loop (22.Yawata H. Yasukawa K. Natsuka S. Murakami M.

Intriguingly, in all type I cytokine receptors these conserved glycines precede the canonical WSXWS sequence motif that is the typical signature of the C-terminal domain of the CRH. It has been suggested that this motif plays a structural role (26.Yamasaki K. Naito S. Anaguchi H. Ohkubo T. Ota Y. Nat. Struct.

Our data and other data suggest that this motif serves as an anchor for the adjacent mobile F/G loop that is crucial for the ligand receptor interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2065792515,"We have evaluated the contribution of intracellular tyrosine residues of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (GCSF-R) to its signaling and cellular outcomes. We began with stable BaF3 cell lines overexpressing wild-type or mutant GCSF-Rs. When all four intracellular tyrosines of the GCSF-R were replaced with phenylalanine (FFFF GCSF-R), cell proliferation and survival were compromised. Replacement of only the membrane-distal tyrosine (YYYF GCSF-R) also showed reduced survival following a GCSF withdrawal/replacement protocol, suggesting a role for this tyrosine. Proliferation by FFFY GCSF-R cells was attenuated by ∼70%. In evaluating the biochemical steps involved in signaling, we then showed that the membrane-distal tyrosine was necessary and sufficient for c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. With the use of a cell-permeable JNK-inhibitory peptide, JNK was implicated in the proliferation of the FFFY GCSF-R mutant. To further define the events linking the membranedistal tyrosine and JNK activation, the Src homology 2 domains of Shc, Grb2, and 3BP2 were shown to bind the full-length GCSF-R and a phosphopeptide encompassing the membrane-distal tyrosine. When binding to variant phosphopeptides based on this membrane-distal tyrosine was tested, altering the amino acids immediately following the phosphotyrosine could selectively abolish the interaction with Shc or Grb2, or the binding to both Grb2 and 3BP2. When these changes were introduced into the full-length GCSF-R and new cell lines created, only the mutant that did not interact with Grb2 and 3BP2 did not activate JNK. Our results suggest that direct binding of Shc by the GCSF-R is not essential for JNK activation.

Griffin J.D. Blood. 1991; 78: 2791-2808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand these important physiological activities, the intracellular signaling events initiated by the G-CSF receptor (GCSF-R) have been extensively evaluated. The GCSF-R has three domains: the extracellular ligand-binding domain, the transmembrane domain, and the intracellular signal transducing domain, which lacks protein kinase activity but contains three subdomains (box 1, 2, and 3), as well as four tyrosine (Y) residues. In the murine GCSF-R these are Tyr-703, Tyr-728, Tyr-743, and Tyr-763 (2.Pan C.-X. Fukunaga R. Yonehara S. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25818-25823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following G-CSF binding, the GCSF-R rapidly homodimerizes and is phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases such as the Janus tyrosine kinases (3.Nicholson S.E. Oates A.C. Harpur A.G. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A.F. Layton J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2985-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The activation of several mitogenic signaling pathways (including Janus tyrosine kinase-STAT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways) then follows (4.Bashey A. Healy L. Marshall C.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 949-957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Tian S.-S. Lamb P. Seidel H.M. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Blood. 1994; 84: 1760-1764Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Rausch O. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1170-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Studies utilizing truncated GCSF-Rs have further defined functional regions within the signal transducing domain. Specifically, the region including box 1 and 2 is critical for mitogenic signaling in BaF3 and FDC-P1 cells (7.Dong F. van Buitenen C. Pouwels K. Hoefsloot L.H. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7774-7781Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 8.Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Pan C.X. Seto Y. Nagata S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2855-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), whereas the region containing box 3, Tyr-728, Tyr-743, and Tyr-763 is essential for differentiation of L-GM, FDC-P1, and 32D myeloid cells (7.Dong F. van Buitenen C. Pouwels K. Hoefsloot L.H. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7774-7781Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 9.Fukunaga R. Ishizaka-Ikeda E. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 74: 1079-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, there are also conflicting results obtained with this approach (7.Dong F. van Buitenen C. Pouwels K. Hoefsloot L.H. Lowenberg B. Touw I.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7774-7781Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 10.Hunter M.G. Avalos B.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4979-4987PubMed Google Scholar), and so the role of the individual Tyr residues has also been assessed more specifically by mutagenesis within the context of the intact GCSF-R. In this way, each Tyr has been replaced alone or in combination with phenylalanine (Phe) (11.Nicholson S.E. Starr R. Novak U. Hilton D.J. Layton J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26947-26953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 12.Akbarzadeh S. Ward A.C. McPhee D.O. Alexander W.S. Lieschke G.J. Layton J.E.

Blood. 1996; 87: 132-140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon phosphorylation, each Tyr of the receptor would be expected to interact directly with Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins, thereby bringing signaling proteins together (15.Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar, 16.Pawson T. Gish G. Cell. 1992; 71: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). The binding specificity of each SH2 domain is dictated by the three residues immediately C-terminal to the phosphotyrosine (17.Fantl W.J. Escobedo J.A. Martin G.A. Turck C.W. del Rosario M. McCormick F. Williams L.T. Cell. 1992; 69: 413-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 18.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T.

This explains how the disruption of a single Tyr could specifically affect a defined signal transduction event. Therefore, the membrane-proximal tyrosine (Tyr-703), which is a predicted STAT3 binding site (YXXQ) in the GCSF-R can be disrupted. This Tyr-703 → Phe mutant displayed reduced ability to activate STAT3 in M1 myeloid leukemic cells (19.Chakraborty A. Dyer K.F. Cascio M. Mietzner T.A. Tweardy D.J. Blood. 1999; 1: 15-24Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, disruption of the membrane-distal tyrosine (a Tyr-763 → Phe mutation) completely abrogated G-CSF-stimulated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) MAPK activation in BaF3 pro-B cells (6.Rausch O. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1170-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In this study, we found signaling initiated by the membrane-distal tyrosine of the GCSF-R contributed to cell proliferation and survival, as well as JNK activation in response to G-CSF. Utilization of a cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of JNK showed that JNK mediated the proliferative signal initiated from the membrane-distal tyrosine. Binding partners for the membrane-distal tyrosine were then investigated to evaluate how cytokine receptors initiate JNK pathway activation. Previous data predicting SH2 domain binding partners (18.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B.

Biol. 1994; 14: 2777-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar) could not unambiguously identify a direct binding partner for GCSF-R Tyr-763, although we confirmed that Shc interacted with the membrane-distal tyrosine of the full-length GCSF-R. We therefore utilized peptides based on the sequence surrounding this phosphorylated membrane-distal tyrosine of the GCSF-R to biochemically identify candidate direct binding proteins. Using BIAcore analyses we identified three adaptor proteins (Shc, Grb2, and 3BP2) as high affinity partners. This analysis was extended to evaluate how alteration of the amino acids immediately following the membrane-distal tyrosine might confer signaling specificity, with these mutations then introduced into the context of the full-length GCSF-R. This analysis revealed that the direct binding of Shc or Grb2 is not required for JNK activation by the GCSF-R. Materials—All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. The Shc and Grb2 antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The Fyn, SHP2, 3BP2, ERK, JNK1, and Stat3 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, whereas the Tyr(P)-705 Stat3 antibody (clone 9E12), phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10), and phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The GCSF-R antibody LMM741 was produced as described (3.Nicholson S.E. Oates A.C. Harpur A.G. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A.F. Layton J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2985-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The Anti-Active® JNK and ERK antibodies were from Promega. The horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies and Supersignal chemiluminescence reagents were from Pierce. LumiLight PLUS chemiluminescence reagents were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Interleukin-3 (IL-3) and Nonidet P-40 were from Calbiochem. [γ-32P]ATP, Hybond ECL nitrocellulose, and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were from Amersham Biosciences. R-phycoerythrin (PE) goat anti-mouse IgG1 (γ1) conjugate was from Molecular Probes. Recombinant human G-CSF was a gift from Amgen. Peptides—Peptides based on the wild-type and altered membrane-distal tyrosine (Tyr-763; YENI) sequence of the murine GCSF-R were commercially produced. The equivalent tyrosine of the human GCSF-R (Tyr-764) is contained within a similar sequence, with a conservative isoleucine → leucine substitution at the Y+3 position (YENL). A peptide sequence based on the phosphorylated membrane-distal tyrosine of the GCSF-R (9-mer) was obtained with an added N-terminal biotinylated penetratin (cell-permeable) peptide sequence. This peptide is referred to as BP-Y*ENI (B-Ahx-RRWRRWWRRWWRRWRRSPKSY*ENIW-amide; Auspep). As controls, we also obtained a phenylalanine mutant (BP-FENI; B-Ahx-RRWRRWWRRWWRRWRRSPKSFENIW-amide; Auspep) and the biotinylated penetratin alone (BP; B-Ahx-RRWRRWWRRWWRRWRR-amide; Mimotopes). An additional biotinylated 9-mer peptide was also synthesized, but without the inclusion of the penetratin sequence, to produce B-Y*ENI (B-Ahx-TPSPKSY*ENIWF-amide; Auspep). A series of unbiotinylated peptides were also produced by the UWA Protein Facility and included Y*ENI (CSPKSY*ENIW-amide), Y*EAI (CSPKSY*EAIW-amide), Y*VNV (CSPKSY*VNVW-amide), Y*AAA (CSPKSY*AAAW-amide), and Y*ENQ (CSPKSY*ENQW-amide). All peptides were >70% pure, as determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. GCSF-R Mutagenesis and Generation of Stable BaF3 Cell Lines— GCSF-R mutants in which tyrosines were replaced with phenylalanine were mutant human GCSF-Rs. The membrane-distal tyrosine was replaced with phenylalanine (YYYF), only the membrane-distal tyrosine retained (FFFY), or all tyrosine residues replaced (FFFF). The residues following the membrane-distal tyrosine were also mutated within the murine GCSF-R to produce the YEAI, YVNV, and YAAA mutants. The residues C-terminal to the membrane-distal tyrosine were similarly mutated within the human GCSF-R to create the YENQ GCSF-R mutant. A wild-type murine or human GCSF-R cell line was produced with each set of mutants and used as a control. The FFFY, YYYF, and FFFF GCSF-R cell lines were produced by the method described (11.Nicholson S.E. Starr R. Novak U. Hilton D.J. Layton J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26947-26953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), except for co-transfection with the pgKNeo-pA plasmid encoding neomycin resistance. The YEAI, YVNV, and YAAA mutant GCSF-R cell lines were produced by the method described (6.Rausch O. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1170-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The YENQ mutant was produced by mutation of the full-length GCSF-R cDNA (21.Fukunaga R. Seto Y. Mizushima S. Nagata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8702-8706Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) in Bluescript SK+ using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutated GCSF-R was then cloned into the XbaI site of the mammalian expression vector pEF-BOS (22.Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18 (5322): 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar) and correct orientation and presence of mutation confirmed by Dye Terminator sequencing (ABI PRISM™). Parental BaF3 cells were electroporated at 230 V, 960 microfarads for 1 s with pEF-BOS plasmids containing wild-type or mutated GCSF-Rs and ScaI-linearized pcDNA3.1 containing the neomycin resistance gene (Invitrogen). Following selection in neomycin (1.2 mg/ml), cells stably expressing the GCSF-R were stained using 10 μg/ml anti-human GCSF-R antibody LMM741, and PE-goat anti-mouse IgG1 (γ1) conjugate, and sorted by flow cytometry. Cell Culture and Stimulation—BaF3 cells, which stably express the wild-type or mutated GCSF-R, and NFS-60 cells, which endogenously express the GCSF-R, were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.01 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) WEHI-3BD-conditioned medium (6.Rausch O. Marshall C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1170-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Prior to each experiment, BaF3 or NFS-60 cells were cultured (1 × 107 cells/ml) in the absence of IL-3 for 3 h. Cells were then stimulated with G-CSF (75 ng/ml; times as indicated). Assessment of BaF3 Cell Survival and Proliferation—The contribution of the membrane-distal tyrosine to proliferation and survival signaling was determined following the creation of stable BaF3 cell lines expressing the wild-type GCSF-R or the Tyr → Phe GCSF-R mutants YYYF, FFFY, and FFFF. For all cell lines, expression of comparable levels of GCSF-R was confirmed by flow cytometry using the anti-human GCSF-R antibody LMM741. For the evaluation of the contribution of the membrane-distal tyrosine of the GCSF-R to survival signaling, cells were deprived of G-CSF for between 2 and 24 h, then G-CSF returned to media for the remaining 24-h period. Viability at 24 h was determined by staining with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) (23.Chay K.-O. Park S.S. Mushinski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14521-14529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Viable cells were those that excluded both reagents. For the evaluation of the contribution of the membrane-distal tyrosine of the GCSF-R to proliferative signaling, cells were deprived of IL-3 for 2 h and then stimulated with G-CSF (50 ng/ml) or IL-3 (20 ng/ml) for 6 days. Viable cells only (discriminated by exclusion of trypan blue) were counted using a hemocytometer. Results shown are from one clone expressing each receptor mutant; similar results were also obtained in two other FFFF clones and one other clone for the wild-type, YYYF, and FFFY GCSF-R. 2T. S. Kendrick and M. A. Bogoyevitch, unpublished observations. Where indicated, cells were cultured in the presence of G-CSF with 10 μm FITC-labeled cell-permeable inhibitor of JNK (FITCGRKKRRQRRRPPRPKRPTTLNLF; Tat-TIJIP; Auspep) based on the human immunodeficiency virus Tat protein transduction domain (24.Schwarze S.R. Hruska K.A. Dowdy S.F. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 290-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) and a peptide JNK inhibitor (25.Barr R.K. Kendrick T.S. Bogoyevitch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10987-10997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), which was replenished every 48 h. Preparation of Cellular Lysates—Cells (2 × 107) were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 500 μm dithiothreitol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100) (26.Ng D.C.H. Bogoyevitch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40856-40866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (20,800 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), the supernatants retained as the cellular lysates, and protein concentrations assayed (27.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Preparation of Recombinant SH2 Domain Fusion Proteins—Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and then purified (28.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 67: 31-40Crossref Scopus (5043) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined (27.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) and size and purity evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. All proteins were ≥95% pure. Affinity Purification of Interacting Proteins from Cellular Lysates— Interaction of GST-SH2 domains with the GCSF-R was evaluated. We incubated 20 μg of GST-Shc SH2 or GST-Grb2 SH2 domain fusion proteins with cellular lysates prepared from BaF3 cells expressing the WT, FFFY, or YYYF GCSF-Rs for 2h at 4 °C. Complexes were captured on glutathione-Sepharose 4B by incubation overnight at 4 °C, pellets washed, and SDS sample buffer added. For cells treated with cell-permeable peptides, rapid peptide uptake was confirmed by flow cytometry.2 Streptavidin-agarose was added to each cellular lysate (3.75 mg of protein/sample) and incubated for 1 hat 4 °C. Pellets were washed and SDS sample buffer added. For evaluation of binding in vitro, each cellular lysate (1.27 mg of protein/sample) was incubated with 3.4 μm BP, BP-FENI, or BP-Y*ENI overnight at 4 °C. Streptavidin-agarose was added during the final 60 min, after which pellets were washed and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Immunoblotting and Far Western Analyses—Proteins (either total cell lysates, or the resulting pelleted proteins from association with the GCSF-R-derived peptides) were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10 or 12% gels as appropriate, transferred to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes, and then blotted with antibodies specific for Shc, Grb2, phosphotyrosine, GCSF-R, or phospho-Stat3. In parallel experiments we also immunoblotted with antibodies to PLC-γ, Stat3, SHP-2, Fyn, or 3BP2, but in these instances either there was no indication of association with the membrane-distal tyrosine (PLC-γ, Stat3, SHP-2, or Fyn) or poor immunoreactivity and poor specificity of reaction with total cell lysates (3BP2).2 Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for 1 h in either 1% (w/v) BSA/TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for the detection of phosphotyrosine; 1% (w/v) BSA/TBS for phospho-JNK or phospho-ERK; or 5% (w/v) milk powder/TBST for the detection of all remaining proteins. Membranes were then incubated overnight in the primary antibody (1/500 to 1/2000 in the appropriate block solution or 0.1% (w/v) BSA/TBST for phospho-JNK or phospho-ERK; 4 °C). Following incubation with HRP-labeled secondary antibodies, detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence using either the Supersignal reagent or the higher sensitivity LumiLight Plus reagent as appropriate. In addition, Far Western analysis of binding partners was performed. GST fusion proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and blocked in 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 1% (w/v) BSA, 5% (w/v) milk in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 1 h. Membranes were washed in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) and incubated overnight at 4 °C in 5 μm biotinylated Y*ENI (B-Y*ENI) in Buffer A. Membranes were then washed in Buffer A without dithiothreitol and incubated in streptavidin-HRP (1/1000 in 1% (w/v) milk/TBST) for 2 hat room temperature. Following washing in TBST, bound phosphopeptide was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. The position of the GST-SH2 domain fusion proteins was confirmed by Ponceau Red staining. BIAcore Analyses—Real-time kinetic studies of the interactions between GST-SH2 domain fusion proteins and peptides based on the membrane-distal tyrosine of the GCSF-R were performed on a BIAcore 2000 biosensor. For all studies, the running and sample dilution buffer was 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20. The biotinylated peptides (BP, BP-FENI, and BP-Y*ENI) were immobilized onto 3 flow cells of each 4-flow cell streptavidin-biosensor chip. Low concentrations corresponding to ∼50-100 resonance units (RU) were used to control for mass transport effects and the avidity effects of GST dimers (29.Ladbury J.E. Lemmon M.A. Zhou M. Green J. Botfield M.C. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3199-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The remaining flow cell on each chip remained blank to measure background interactions. The binding of a GST-SH2 domain protein to the immobilized peptides was recorded as RU in real time to provide a sensorgram. A flow rate of 20 μl/min reduced mass transport effects and the overestimation of affinity as a result of rebinding. In these studies, the chip was regenerated with 0.1% (w/v) SDS between injections. Data were analyzed using BIAevaluation software version 3.1. In-solution competitive binding assays were used to evaluate the relative affinities of the SH2 domains for the phosphopeptides. The GST-SH2 domains at subsaturating amounts (400 nm or 1 μm) were preincubated with increasing amounts of the Y*ENI, Y*ENQ, Y*AAA, Y*EAI, or Y*VNV peptides and flowed over the immobilized B-Y*ENI peptide. For these studies, the chip was regenerated with 3 m potassium thiocyanate (two 1-min pulses) at the end of each cycle, followed by 6 m guanidine HCl (two 1-min pulses) at the end of each day. Data (RU expressed as a percentage of total RU bound in the absence of competing peptide) were plotted against the log [competing peptide]. The data were fitted to a Logistic 3 parameter sigmoidal plot by nonlinear regression using Sigma Plot (SPSS Inc.), and IC50 values determined as the concentration of peptide required to displace 50% of the bound SH2 domain. JNK Activation Assays—Activation of JNK was assayed by the in vitro phosphorylation of GST-c-Jun (30.Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). Cellular lysate (75 μg) was incubated with GST-c-Jun and glutathione-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C. Following washing, the kinase reaction was initiated with 1μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate) containing 20 μm ATP, 100 μm sodium vanadate, and 500 μm dithiothreitol, then incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. 32P incorporation into the substrate was assessed by autoradiography followed by Cerenkov counting of the SDS-PAGE-separated proteins. For assessment of JNK and ERK activity in the presence of the JNK inhibitor, Tat-TIJIP, lysate (200 μg) from G-CSF-stimulated WT GCSF-R BaF3 cells was incubated with 40 μg of GST-c-Jun or GST-Elk (26.Ng D.C.H. Bogoyevitch M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40856-40866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), complexes captured on glutathione-Sepharose 4B and divided into two aliquots. Samples were then treated with buffer or Tat-TIJIP (2 μm) for 10 min at 30 °C, prior to assaying of kinase activity by incubation with [γ-32P]ATP as described above. Evaluation of Cell Survival and Proliferation Mediated by Mutant GCSF-Rs—To evaluate the contribution of the GCSF-R membrane-distal tyrosine to G-CSF-mediated biological effects, we assessed cell survival and cell proliferation mediated by the wild-type GCSF-R in parallel with GCSF-R mutants containing only the membrane-distal tyrosine (FFFY), without this tyrosine (YYYF), or with all tyrosines mutated (FFFF). The expression of comparable levels of the GCSF-Rs was first confirmed by flow cytometry using LMM741 and an anti-mouse IgG1-PE conjugate.2 For survival studies, cells were deprived of G-CSF for between 2 and 24 h. G-CSF was returned to the media for the remaining time in the 24-h period, and the viability determined by staining with annexin V-FITC and PI at this 24-h time point. Staining was detected by flow cytometry, and those cells excluding both reagents were counted as viable cells (Fig. 1a). No significant changes in viability were observed with up to 5 h of G-CSF deprivation (Fig. 1a, upper left panel). Following 7 and 8 h of G-CSF withdrawal, all of the GCSF-R mutants showed reduced survival. Viability of the YYYF and FFFF GCSF-R mutants continued to fall during the subsequent 8-12 h of G-CSF withdrawal (Fig. 1a, middle and lower left panels). In addition, after 10 h of G-CSF withdrawal, the survival of cells expressing the wild-type GCSF-R was also compromised (Fig. 1a, middle right panel). Deprivation of G-CSF for 12-24 h affected the survival of all cells (Fig. 1a, lower panels), and specifically by 24 h there was no significant difference in the survival advantage noted for each cell line following prolonged G-CSF withdrawal (Fig. 1a, lower right panel). These observations confirm an essential role of signaling by the tyrosine residues of the GCSF-R with the loss of all tyrosines of the GCSF-R being most deleterious to cell survival following short periods of G-CSF withdrawal (7-12 h). Loss of the three membrane-proximal tyrosines in the FFFY GCSF-R mutant had less severe effects, whereas loss of the membrane-distal tyrosine alone in the YYYF GCSF-R mutant was intermediate in effect. This suggests that the membrane-distal tyrosine contributes to survival signaling by the GCSF-R. The contribution of the membrane-di"

We found that a sub-population of brain synapsin Ia, a splice variant of one of three synapsin isoforms, inhibits the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity of several RGS proteins. Inhibition is highly selective for Gαz, a member of the Gi family that is found in neurons, platelets, adrenal chromaffin cells, and a few other neurosecretory cells. Gz has been indirectly implicated in the regulation of secretion. Synapsin Ia constitutes a major fraction of the total GAP-inhibitory activity in brain, and its inhibitory activity is absent from the brains of synapsin I-/-/II-/- mice. Inhibition depends on the cationic D/E domain of synapsin. Phosphorylation of synapsin Ia at serine 9 by either cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase or p21-activated protein kinase (PAK1) attenuates its potency as a GAP inhibitor more than 7-fold. Synapsin can thus act as a phosphorylation-modulated mediator of feedback regulation of Gz signaling by the synaptic machinery.

Gz is a member of the Gi family of heterotrimeric G proteins that is expressed primarily in neurons, platelets, and adrenal chromaffin cells (1Fields T.A. Casey P.J. Biochem.

Consistent with its expression in committed secretory cells, Gz is apparently involved in signaling from cell surface receptors to the secretory machinery. It is required for normal platelet degranulation in response to α-adrenergic stimulation (3Yang J. Wu J. Kowalska M.A. Dalvi A. Prevost N. O'Brien P.J. Manning D. Poncz M. Lucki I. Blendy J.A.

Although Gz can regulate the usual group of Gi effector proteins, it may also have unique targets of its own (2Ho M.K.C. Wong Y.H.

Fong H.K.W. Simon M.I. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2383-2390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To carry out cellular signaling with reasonable response kinetics, Gz relies on GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) 1The abbreviations used are: GAPGTPase-activating proteinCaMcalmodulinPAKp21-activated protein kinasePKAprotein kinase AGSTglutathione S-transferasePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideRecrecombinant synapsin IaNatsynapsin Ia purified from brainPP2Aprotein phosphatase 2aMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: GAPGTPase-activating proteinCaMcalmodulinPAKp21-activated protein kinasePKAprotein kinase AGSTglutathione S-transferasePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideRecrecombinant synapsin IaNatsynapsin Ia purified from brainPP2Aprotein phosphatase 2aMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. of the RGS protein family. Members of the RGSZ subfamily can accelerate hydrolysis of Gαz-bound GTP over 600-fold (9Wang J. Ducret A. Tu Y. Kozasa T. Aebersold R. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26014-26025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and other RGS proteins probably stimulate to similar extents (10Tu Y. Woodson J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20160-20166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Such acceleration both allows Gz to respond to removal of receptor agonists on a reasonable physiological time scale and provides a way of inhibiting Gz-mediated signaling by decreasing its activation lifetime (11Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about how GAP activity is regulated in cells. RGS proteins can be inhibited by phosphorylation or palmitoylation, by binding to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and by phosphorylation or palmitoylation of their Gα substrates. However, the quantitative importance and physiological control of these processes are not well understood (see Refs. 11Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 12Hollinger S. Hepler J.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 527-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar, 13De Vries L. Zheng B.

Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar for reviews).During the purification of the Gz-selective GAP RGSZ1 from brain, we noted that membrane-bound Gz GAP activity increased when a crude cerebral cortical membrane fraction was washed with high ionic strength buffer (14Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We show here that the high salt extract contains protein inhibitors of Gz GAP activity as well as inhibitors of other G protein GAPs. By purifying the inhibitory factors, we found that synapsin Ia is a major and selective inhibitor of Gz GAP activity in brain.Synapsins are abundant neuronal phosphoproteins that bind both actin filaments and synaptic vesicles, and they are responsible for ordered vesicle packing in the reserve pool of the synaptic terminal (see Refs. 15Pieribone V.A.

Three synapsin genes exist in mammals, and each is expressed as at least two splice products, but unique roles for the individual synapsin proteins have been hard to ascertain. Disruption of the genes for either or both major synapsin proteins I and II causes disorganization of synaptic vesicles and leads to a decrease in vesicle number. Consequent physiological effects of synapsin gene disruption include deficient vesicle recycling, altered adaptive response to paired or repetitive stimulation and a tendency to seizures (18Ryan T.A.

Long term and developmental anomalies caused by synapsin gene disruption may result from loss of synaptic vesicle organization but may also reflect novel regulatory roles of the synapsins (22Ferreira A. Rapoport M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Diverse protein kinases phosphorylate synapsins at multiple sites in response to a wide variety of extracellular inputs (16Hilfiker S.

Both CaM kinase II and p21-regulated kinase (PAK) catalyze phosphorylation of two serine residues, and phosphorylation at these sites results in the inability of synapsin to bind to actin (23Czernik A.J.

Nature. 1987; 326: 704-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). One of these sites, serine 9, is also phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (23Czernik A.J. Pang D.T. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7518-7522Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The complexity of synapsin phosphorylation suggests that it may mediate signaling events in addition to actin binding, and some of these events may account for yet unexplained effects of synapsin gene disruption. As an initial step toward understanding the functional interaction between synapsin I, Gz, and RGS proteins in regulating synaptic activity, we characterize here the ability of synapsin Ia to inhibit Gz GAPs and the control of inhibition by synapsin phosphorylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—RGS proteins, Gαi1 and Gαo were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (9Wang J.

The catalytic subunit of PKA was purchased from Sigma. Gαz was purified from Sf9 cells as described previously (14Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

Wang C.-R. Hosaka M. Smagula S.C. Südhof T.C. Deisenhofer J.

Sf9 cell pellets were homogenized at 4 °C in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.02 mg/ml DNase I, and protease inhibitors (0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.01 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.002 mg/ml pepstatin)). After 10 min, 250 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100 were added and the cell lysates were stirred for 30 min. After centrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min), the supernatant was diluted 4-fold with buffer A (20 mm NaHepes (pH 8), 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors) and applied to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose that was equilibrated with buffer A plus 0.2% Triton X-100. The resin was washed with 200 ml of buffer A plus 1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 7.5 mm imidazole and then with 50 ml of buffer A plus 100 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Triton X-100. Synapsin was eluted with buffer A plus 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 150 mm imidazole. Purified synapsin was exchanged into storage buffer (50 mm NaHepes (pH 8), 0.05% Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol), flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Protein was estimated according to the method of Schaffner and Weismann (28Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal.

Cerebral cortices from two to three steers were washed in 0.9% NaCl and homogenized in a Waring blender in 1 liter of TEP buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm PMSF, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin). The homogenate was passed through cheesecloth and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was homogenized in TEP buffer and centrifuged again. The pellet was suspended in 300 ml of TEP buffer plus 1 mm dithiothreitol and 300 mm NaCl, homogenized by five strokes with a Dounce homogenizer and stirred at 4 °C for 30 min. The homogenate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The clear supernatant was diluted 6-fold with Buffer I (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm PMSF, 0.05% Lubrol PX) and passed through a 200-ml column of DEAE-Sephacel that was equilibrated with Buffer I. The flowthrough was incubated with 30 ml of CM-Sepharose 6B for at least 1 h. The resin was washed in a column with 200 ml of Buffer I and 50 ml of Buffer I plus 30 mm NaCl. Protein was eluted with a 150-ml gradient of 30-300 mm NaCl in Buffer I. A broad peak of GAP-inhibitory activity was eluted between 150 and 250 mm NaCl. The pooled peak fractions (∼40 ml) were mixed with 4 m NaCl and 2 m (NH4)2SO4 to yield final concentrations of 1 m NaCl and 0.4 m (NH4)2SO4. The mixture was centrifuged, and the supernatant was mixed with 5 ml of phenyl-Sepharose for 45 min. The resin was washed in a column with Buffer I plus 1 m NaCl and 0.4 m (NH4)2SO4 and GAP-inhibitory activity was eluted with buffer I. Pooled active fractions were diluted 5-fold with Buffer II (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Lubrol, 0.3 mm PMSF) and applied to a column of Mono S (1.5 ml) that had been equilibrated with Buffer II. The column was washed sequentially with Buffer II, Buffer II plus 0.05 m NaCl, and a gradient of 0.05-0.40 m NaCl in Buffer II. Active fractions were concentrated on an Amicon PM10 membrane.

Pooled inhibitor was denatured at room temperature in Tris-phosphate sample buffer (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar) that contained 0.25% SDS and 10 mm dithiothreitol and fractionated by electrophoresis at 4 °C on 10% acrylamide gels (∼0.2 mg on a 180-× 150-× 0.75-mm gel). Proteins were extracted from gel slices by homogenization in 5-10 volumes of renaturation buffer (20 mm NaHepes (pH 7.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Triton X-100) and shaking overnight at 4 °C. About 50-60% of GAP-inhibitory activity was recovered from the gel. Activity was broadly distributed between 15 and 100 kDa (data not shown; recoveries in Table II), with two peaks of activity reproducibly appearing at about 20 and 80 kDa. The 80-kDa region was cut and extracted again, and eluted protein was electrophoresed similarly on a 8% acrylamide gel. The highest inhibitory activity could be assigned to a single protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa.To compare GAP-inhibitory activity in brains of wild type and synapsin I-/-/II-/- mice (20Rosahl T.W. Spillane D. Missler M. Herz J. Selig D.K. Wolff J.R. Hammer R.E. Malenka R.C. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 488-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), inhibitor was partially purified by DEAESephacel and CM-Sepharose as described above. The active fractions were concentrated by Centricon PM10 and electrophoresed on 10% gels at 4 °C. Activity was extracted from the 70- to 100-kDa and 15- to 25-kDa regions of the gels.Protein Analysis—The ∼75-kDa protein band from the 8% acrylamide gel described above was transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and visualized by Amido Black staining. Protein bands were cut in 1-mm squares, and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C in 15-20 μl of 15 mmN-ethylmorpholine, 5 mm acetic acid, 1% Zwittergent 3-16 (Calbiochem) that contained 1 μg of sequencing grade-modified trypsin (Promega). The supernatant was collected, the membrane pieces were washed with another 15 μl of digestion buffer, and both fractions were pooled for peptide analysis.Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—Samples were denatured, reduced with dithiothreitol, and alkylated by N-ethylmaleimide. Amounts of protein applied to gels for immunoblots were normalized according to Coomassie Blue staining of the specific band. Immunoblots from 8% acrylamide gels were probed with antiserum in 10% blocking solution and developed according to instructions in the ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). Polyclonal synapsin antibody (E028), a gift from Thomas Südhof, was raised against a peptide common to all synapsin isoforms (30Hosaka M. Südhof T.C. J. Biol.

Protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, ∼20 μg), equilibrated in the same buffer, was added, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. After centrifugation, 6 μl of each supernatant was assayed for GAP inhibition. The amount of synapsin remaining in the supernatant was estimated by immunoblot.GAP Assay—GAP activity was measured according to the acceleration of hydrolysis of [γ-32P]GTP that was pre-bound to a Gα subunit as described previously (14Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 32Wang J. Tu Y. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Biddlecome G.H. Ross E.M. Manning D.R. G Proteins: Techniques of Analysis. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1999: 123-151Google Scholar). GAP activities are described either as the increment in the first-order rate constant for GTP hydrolysis (1 GAP unit = 1 min-1 increment) or in terms of Vmax and Km for the overall reaction in which the GAP is formally assumed to catalyze the conversion of Gα-GTP to Gα-GDP. To quantitate inhibitory activity, we define a unit as the amount that decreases the Gz GAP activity of RGS4 by 50%. For these assays, the concentration of RGS4 was 0.4 nm and that of Gz-[γ-32P]GTP was usually ∼2.5 nm (Km ∼ 8 nm). To measure inhibition of RGS4 with other Gα substrates (see Table III), GAP assays were performed at 4 °C with 3 nm RGS4, 8.5 nm [γ-32P]GTP-Gαz, 10 nm [γ-32P]GTP-Gαi1, and 11 nm [γ-32P]GTP-Gαo. Crude extracts of cerebral cortex were prepared by homogenizing cortex in 20 mm Hepes, 0.2% Triton X-100, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, and 300 mm NaCl, sonicating four times for 30 s and centrifuging at 30,000 × g for 30 min to remove particulate material.Table IIISynapsin Ia specifically inhibits Gz GAP activity GAP assays were performed at 4 °C as described previously (10Tu Y. Woodson J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20160-20166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Activities are shown as the increment in the hydrolytic rate constant of each Gα-[γ-32P]GTP (min-1) caused by 3 nm RGS4 in the absence of inhibitor and in the presence of either 300 nm recombinant synapsin Ia or 50 μg/ml of a crude extract of bovine cerebral cortex. Concentrations of substrates and their intrinsic GTPase rate constants were, for Gαz: 8.5 nm, <0.006 min-1; Gαo: 11 nm, 0.07 min-1; Gαi1: 10 nm, 0.24 min-1. Data shown are averages from two separate experiments with each determination in duplicate.SubstrateGAP activityControlSynapsinBrain extractmin-1Gαz0.140.0120.10Gαo0.370.360.22Gαi10.560.570.37 Open table in a new tab Synapsin Phosphorylation—To phosphorylate synapsin fractions, synapsin was incubated with or without 100 nm GST-PAK1 at 30 °C for 2 h in 50 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and either unlabeled ATP or [γ-32P]ATP (0.5 mm). For phosphorylation with the catalytic subunit of PKA, the concentration of MgCl2 was 5 mm and 0.1 mm EGTA was included. Reactions were terminated by addition of EDTA to 10 mm. Fractional phosphorylation was determined by scintillation counting of radioactive bands cut from polyacrylamide gels. For dephosphorylation with intestinal alkaline phosphatase or PP2A, either recombinant synapsin Ia (Rec) or synapsin Ia purified from brain (Nat) was treated as follows: 3.2 μg of Rec or 1.6 μg of Nat, 10 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (or phosphatase inactivated at 100 °C for 10 min), 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 30 min, 30 °C; 8 μg of Rec or 2 μg of Nat, 1.4 μg of PP2A, 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.4), 20 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 25 min, 30 °C. For dephosphorylation with acid phosphatase, synapsin Ia (1 μm recombinant or 0.5 μm from bovine brain) was incubated at 30 °C for 1.5-2 h with potato acid phosphatase (Sigma type VII; 0.3 unit/μg of synapsin) in 25 mm MES-OH, pH 5.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.3 mm PMSF, 2.5 mm benzamidine. In experiments where dephosphorylation followed in vitro phosphorylation reactions, hexokinase (1 unit) and 1 mm glucose were added to destroy ATP, and, after 20 min at 30 °C, pH was adjusted to 5.0-5.5 with MES before addition of acid phosphatase.Synapsin Ia was hyperphosphorylated by exposing baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells to 1 μm okadaic acid for 2 h before harvest. The lysis buffer included 25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2, 20 μg/ml DNase I, 50 mm NaF, 3 μmp-nitrophenyl phosphate, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 250 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100. Purification following lysis was as described above.RESULTSIdentification of Synapsin Ia as a GzGAP Inhibitor in Brain—In the course of purifying the Gz-selective GAP RGSZ1 from bovine brain, we observed that total Gz GAP activity in the membrane fraction increased about 2-fold after washing with high ionic strength buffer, which suggested that washing removed some inhibitory activity (14Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5732-5740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, the high salt extract inhibited both the endogenous Gz GAP activity of the washed brain membranes and the Gz GAP activity of purified RGS4. The extent of inhibition increased with the amount of extract added to the GAP assay, and maximal inhibition exceeded 90% (Fig. 1A). The extract could also inhibit the GAP activities of purified recombinant RGSZ1 or RGS10, although the extent and potency of inhibition varied depending on which GAP was used (see below). The inhibitory activity was sensitive to trypsin, was not found in cytosol, and was eluted from membranes maximally by 300 mm NaCl (data not shown). The inhibitor thus behaved like a cytoskeletal or peripheral membrane protein. GAP-inhibiting activity was found in several mammalian cell types, but was not found in Escherichia coli or in Sf9 insect cells (Fig. 1B).Table IGAP-inhibiting activity in bovine brain membranes Gz GAP activity was measured in crude bovine brain membranes before and after washing with 1 m NaCl. The mixture of washed membranes plus high salt extract displayed a total activity of 31 milliunits, and the activity of the membranes after subtraction of the GAP activity in the extract is shown. The ability of the extract to inhibit the GAP activity of RGS4 is also shown, again after subtraction of the activity in the extract alone. Data are averages of duplicate determinations in two separate experiments and are expressed as milliunits of GAP activity (14Wang J. Tu Y. Woodson J. Song X. Ross E.M. J. Biol.

We used the inhibition of RGS4, a soluble and convenient nonspecific GAP (10Tu Y. Woodson J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20160-20166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), to follow purification of inhibitory activity. As shown in Table II, inhibitory activity did not bind to anion exchangers but did bind to cation exchangers and to phenyl-Sepharose, and initial chromatographic purification was about 100-fold. However, the chromatographic behavior of the inhibitory activity suggested that it was not a single species. Partially purified inhibitor was permanently deactivated by heating in SDS plus dithiothreitol, but could be reactivated after exposure to SDS if it was not heated. This behavior allowed further separation of inhibitory factors by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by renaturation in buffer that contained Triton X-100. GAP-inhibiting activity was separated into two fractions of apparent molecular masses of 70-80 and 15-20 kDa, neither of which was homogeneous according to protein staining. The two fractions contained about equal activity, and recovery of total activity was about 50% (Table II). The low molecular weight fraction was diffuse according to both protein staining and activity (not shown) and was not studied further. The high molecular weight fraction contained discrete protein bands according to protein staining, and inhibitory activity could be assigned to a single protein band after electrophoresis on large gels under optimized conditions (Fig. 2).Fig."
https://openalex.org/W2069361788,"Mammalian Vav signal transducer proteins couple receptor tyrosine kinase signals to the activation of the Rho/Rac GTPases, leading to cell differentiation and/or proliferation. The unique and complex structure of mammalian Vav proteins is preserved in the Drosophila melanogaster homologue, DroVav. We demonstrate that DroVav functions as a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for DRac. Drosophila cells overexpressing wild-type (wt) DroVav exhibited a normal morphology. However, overexpression of a truncated DroVav mutant (that functions as an oncogene when expressed in NIH3T3 cells) results in striking changes in the actin cytoskeleton, resembling those usually visible following Rac activation. Dominant-negative DRac abrogated these morphological changes, suggesting that the effect of the truncated DroVav mutant is mediated by activation of DRac. In Drosophila cells, we find that stimulation of the Drosophila EGF receptor (DER) increases tyrosine phosphorylation of DroVav, which in turn associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated DER. In addition, the following results imply that DroVav participates in downstream DER signalling, such as ERK phosphorylation: (a) overexpression of DroVav induces ERK phosphorylation; and (b) 'knockout' of DroVav by RNA interference blocks ERK phosphorylation induced by DER stimulation. Unlike mammalian Vav proteins, DroVav was not found to induce Jnk phosphorylation under the experimental circumstances tested in fly cells. These results establish the role of DroVav as a signal transducer that participates in receptor tyrosine kinase pathways and functions as a GEF for the small RhoGTPase, DRac."
https://openalex.org/W2087689856,"TGFα/p53+/− transgenic mice represent a genetically engineered mouse model for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The tumors develop a characteristic pattern of secondary genetic changes. From one of these tumors, the permanent cell line TD2 was established. Here, we describe in detail the genetic changes by molecular–cytogenetic techniques. The original tumor-specific CGH profile has been retained unchanged. The most characteristic aberration pattern bears chromosome 11. Egfr, localized on proximal chromosome 11, is amplified two to three times and leads to an easily identifiable, stable marker chromosome with a large amplification unit, which is present in each metaphase. The wild-type p53 gene on distal chromosome 11 is lost. The p16Ink4a locus on chromosome 4 is hypermethylated. For c-Myc a 15-fold amplification, present in a 1.65 Mb amplification unit, is detected on chromosome 15. Transition between presence in the form of several double minutes, DMs, or a single homogeneously staining region, HSR, was observed for c-Myc. Molecular–cytogenetic analysis of both amplification units show that Egfr amplification and c-Myc amplification represent two alternative modes by which genes get amplified in tumor cells. The expression level of the respective genes was proven by Northern blot analysis. The cell line TD2 represents a valuable in vitro model for pancreatic adenocarcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W1966988153,"Phospholipase D from Streptomyces chromofuscus (sc-PLD) is a member of the diverse family of metallo-phosphodiesterase/phosphatase enzymes that also includes purple acid phosphatases, protein phosphatases, and nucleotide phosphodiesterases. Whereas iron is an essential cofactor for scPLD activity, Mn2+ is also found in the enzyme. A third metal ion, Ca2+, has been shown to enhance scPLD catalytic activity although it is not an essential cofactor. Sequence alignment of scPLD with known phosphodiesterases and phosphatases requiring metal ions suggested that His-212, Glu-213, and Asp-389 could be involved in Mn2+ binding. H212A, E213A, and D389A were prepared to test this hypothesis. These three mutant enzymes and wild type scPLD show similar metal content but considerably different catalytic properties, suggesting different roles for each residue. His-212 appears involved in binding the phosphate group of substrates, whereas Glu-213 acts as a ligand for Ca2+. D389A showed a greatly reduced phosphodiesterase activity but almost unaltered ability to hydrolyze the phosphate group in p-nitrophenyl phosphate suggesting it had a critical role in aligning groups at the active site to control phosphodiesterase versus phosphatase activities. We propose a model for substrate and cofactor binding to the catalytic site of scPLD based on these results and on sequence alignment to purple acid phosphatases of known structure."

Here, we expressed in Chinese hamster V79 cells green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged human TRF1, and found that a major fraction of GFP-TRF1 bound to ITs is diffusionally mobile. This fraction strongly decreases after treatment of cells with wortmannin, a protein kinase inhibitor, and this drug also increases the frequency of chromosome aberrations. Ionizing radiation does not induce detectable translocation of GFP-TRF1 to the sites of random double-strand breaks visualized using antibodies against histone gamma-H2AX. TRF1 is known to be eliminated from telomeres by overexpression of tankyrase 1 which induces TRF1 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. We transfected V79 cells by plasmid encoding tankyrase 1 and found that the frequency of chromosome rearrangements is increased in these cells independently of their treatment by IR. Taken together, our results suggest that TRF1 is involved in sequence-specific protection of internal nontelomeric (TTAGGG)n repeats."
