Inhibition of the uptake of strontium by rats given doses of sodium alginate has been reported1–3 and there was a similar experiment with a human adult4. The absorption of calcium was not significantly affected. The results were considered to have potential value in connexion with therapy of overdoses of strontium-90 (ref. 5). The effect of two commercial alginates with different chemical compositions, that is, different ratios of mannuronic and guluronic acid residues in the alginate, on strontium uptake in rats was compared6. The alginate with the greater content of guluronic acid residues reduced the uptake of strontium from the diet more effectively."

https://openalex.org/W1978884049,"WHEN it is given consecutive trials in a T maze, the rat will typically enter one arm of the maze on the initial trial and the opposite arm on the second. This phenomenon has been termed “spontaneous alternation”1. Lesions to the hippocampus or the administration of cholinergic blocking drugs, processes which have been found to interfere with learning and remembering, also impair spontaneous alternation2,3. This suggests that the rate at which an animal spontaneously alternates could be a function of its ability to acquire and retain information. The present investigation was concerned with spontaneous alternation as a function of age. It is well established that the ability to learn and remember develops with maturation4–6. We postulated a parallel development for alternation performance."

https://openalex.org/W2079580837,"RECENTLY there have been several reports on nuclear blebs found in human leukaemic cells1 and in human bone marrow cells of leukaemic patients on drug therapy2. Similar nuclear structures have also been found in developing human3 and guinea-pig4 thymocytes, and possibly in Burkitt's lymphoma5. Anderson6 noted identical nuclear structures in myeloblasts from patients with treated and untreated acute myelocytic leukaemia and referred to them as nuclear loops."

Magnesium, aluminium, cadmium, nickel, copper, gold and platinum, which cover a wide range in the electromotive series, were chosen for the present investigation."

https://openalex.org/W1964551633,"CRYSTALLINE riboflavin is present in the eyes of several fishes and mammals (for example, Galago crassicaudatus)1. Its role in vision, however, is obscure. One possible function may be that of a transducer to convert blue light (efficiently absorbed by the flavin but not by rhodopsin) into energy that can be utilized by rhodopsin producing the chemical signal. This conversion may be achieved by the trivial process of re-emission (the wavelength of fluorescence of riboflavin is at 530 mµ, which is favourable for absorption by rhodopsin)2 or by direct energy transfer either of a singlet–singlet or of a triplet–triplet type."
https://openalex.org/W2084441504,"IN the course of immunological experiments involving the C57BL/Ka and C57BL/6 Jax strains of mice, black spots were noted on the spleens of some mice. These spots were usually found in the posterolateral aspect of the spleens, although a few cases were noted in which the spot was in the anterior portion of the spleen. Histological sections of these spots were characterized by a diffuse scattering of pigmented cells, involving primarily the red pulp of the affected portion of the spleen. These spots occur in a number of (C57BL/Ka × Balb/C)F1 hybrids, but not in Balb/c mice. They are present in affected strains in similar frequency from birth onwards. In order to test whether the appearance of this phenomenon is genetic, and perhaps indicative of some residual heterozygosity in our colony, we carried out laparotomies on a number of hybrid mice, then set up the following mating pairs: black spot × black spot, black spot × normal, normal by normal. The results are shown in Table 1."

https://openalex.org/W1978944759,"MANY ectoparasitic insects are characterized by one or more regular rows of closely set, large stout spines. These rows of spines are termed combs, or ctenidia, and have evolved independently in fleas (Siphonaptera), bat flies (Nycteribiidae), bat bugs (Polyctenidae), and in the beaver beetle Platypsyllus. Hitherto there has been little evidence about their function. It has recently been shown1 that the spacing of spines in the combs of fleas bears a close relationship to the diameter of the hairs of the appropriate host. The gap between the tips of the spines is usually about 1.75 times greater than the average diameter of the host's hairs, but the gap narrows almost to zero towards their base. The same relationship occurs between the combs of Nycteribiids and the fur of their Chiropteran hosts. The general applicability of this principle among ectoparasites was confirmed by measuring the comb of Platypsyllus castoris and the fur of the beaver. The results are summarized in Fig. 1."

Steward et al.5 have recently described the isolation from irradiated sucrose solution of a salt of formic acid which was characterized as sodium formate, and was shown to suppress the growth of carrot phloem explants."

G. saubinetti (conidial stage Fusarium graminearum Schw.). This was followed by the publication of a number of papers on the effect of feeding infected grain to domestic animals."

https://openalex.org/W1967889031,COXSACKIE viral infections are known to cause myocardial lesions in various animal species1. The identification and localization of the Coxsackie viral particles in the heart have not been adequately demonstrated because of the absence of morphological criteria which will differentiate virus particles from glycogen granules and ribosomes. This communication describes the ultrastructural localization of Coxsackie B4 virus particles in the mouse heart by a ferritin antibody technique.

https://openalex.org/W2025117010,"THE population explosion throughout the world is an important problem for governments and a topic much debated among demographers and economists. Any hint about the natural factors which might exercise control over population growth would seem to be worthy of further investigation by experts. The ranges of fertility in different communities vary and the variation would seem to be heritable. Mourant1 states that “blood group studies are probably at present more valuable as a source of genetical information about human populations than studies of all other factors combined, and blood groups will surely remain for many years more important than any other class of factors”."
