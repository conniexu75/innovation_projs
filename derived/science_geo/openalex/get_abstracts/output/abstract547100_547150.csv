https://openalex.org/W2188223075,"The RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 is a versatile genome-editing tool with a broad range of applications from therapeutics to functional annotation of genes. Cas9 creates double-strand breaks (DSBs) at targeted genomic loci complementary to a short RNA guide. However, Cas9 can cleave off-target sites that are not fully complementary to the guide, which poses a major challenge for genome editing. Here, we use structure-guided protein engineering to improve the specificity of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9). Using targeted deep sequencing and unbiased whole-genome off-target analysis to assess Cas9-mediated DNA cleavage in human cells, we demonstrate that ""enhanced specificity"" SpCas9 (eSpCas9) variants reduce off-target effects and maintain robust on-target cleavage. Thus, eSpCas9 could be broadly useful for genome-editing applications requiring a high level of specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2180291937,"The ability to perturb genes in human cells is crucial for elucidating gene function and holds great potential for finding therapeutic targets for diseases such as cancer. To extend the catalog of human core and context-dependent fitness genes, we have developed a high-complexity second-generation genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 gRNA library and applied it to fitness screens in five human cell lines. Using an improved Bayesian analytical approach, we consistently discover 5-fold more fitness genes than were previously observed. We present a list of 1,580 human core fitness genes and describe their general properties. Moreover, we demonstrate that context-dependent fitness genes accurately recapitulate pathway-specific genetic vulnerabilities induced by known oncogenes and reveal cell-type-specific dependencies for specific receptor tyrosine kinases, even in oncogenic KRAS backgrounds. Thus, rigorous identification of human cell line fitness genes using a high-complexity CRISPR-Cas9 library affords a high-resolution view of the genetic vulnerabilities of a cell."
https://openalex.org/W2177415512,"Gene essentiality is typically determined by assessing the viability of the corresponding mutant cells, but this definition fails to account for the ability of cells to adaptively evolve to genetic perturbations. Here, we performed a stringent screen to assess the degree to which Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells can survive the deletion of ~1,000 individual ""essential"" genes and found that ~9% of these genetic perturbations could in fact be overcome by adaptive evolution. Our analyses uncovered a genome-wide gradient of gene essentiality, with certain essential cellular functions being more ""evolvable"" than others. Ploidy changes were prevalent among the evolved mutant strains, and aneuploidy of a specific chromosome was adaptive for a class of evolvable nucleoporin mutants. These data justify a quantitative redefinition of gene essentiality that incorporates both viability and evolvability of the corresponding mutant cells and will enable selection of therapeutic targets associated with lower risk of emergence of drug resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2252937219,"Increasing antibacterial resistance presents a major challenge in antibiotic discovery. One attractive target in Gram-negative bacteria is the unique asymmetric outer membrane (OM), which acts as a permeability barrier that protects the cell from external stresses, such as the presence of antibiotics. We describe a novel β-hairpin macrocyclic peptide JB-95 with potent antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli. This peptide exhibits no cellular lytic activity, but electron microscopy and fluorescence studies reveal an ability to selectively disrupt the OM but not the inner membrane of E. coli. The selective targeting of the OM probably occurs through interactions of JB-95 with selected β-barrel OM proteins, including BamA and LptD as shown by photolabeling experiments. Membrane proteomic studies reveal rapid depletion of many β-barrel OM proteins from JB-95-treated E. coli, consistent with induction of a membrane stress response and/or direct inhibition of the Bam folding machine. The results suggest that lethal disruption of the OM by JB-95 occurs through a novel mechanism of action at key interaction sites within clusters of β-barrel proteins in the OM. These findings open new avenues for developing antibiotics that specifically target β-barrel proteins and the integrity of the Gram-negative OM."
https://openalex.org/W2189553045,"The peripheral nerve system has an intrinsic regenerative capacity in response to traumatic injury. To better understand the molecular events occurring after peripheral nerve injury, in the current study, a rat model of sciatic nerve crush injury was used. Injured nerves harvested at 0, 1, 4, 7, and 14 days post injury were subjected to deep RNA sequencing for examining global gene expression changes. According to the temporally differential expression patterns of a huge number of genes, 3 distinct phases were defined within the post-injury period of 14 days: the acute, sub-acute, and post-acute stages. Each stage showed its own characteristics of gene expression, which were associated with different categories of diseases and biological functions and canonical pathways. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that genes involved in inflammation and immune response were significantly up-regulated in the acute phase, and genes involved in cellular movement, development, and morphology were up-regulated in the sub-acute stage, while the up-regulated genes in the post-acute phase were mainly involved in lipid metabolism, cytoskeleton reorganization, and nerve regeneration. All the data obtained in the current study may help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying peripheral nerve regeneration from the perspective of gene regulation, and to identify potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of peripheral nerve injury."

Hajdu Cheney syndrome, a disease characterized by osteoporosis and fractures, is associated with NOTCH2 mutations resulting in a truncated stable protein and gain-of-function. We created a mouse model reproducing the Hajdu Cheney syndrome by introducing a 6955C→T mutation in the Notch2 locus leading to a Q2319X change at the amino acid level. Notch2Q2319X heterozygous mutants were smaller and had shorter femurs than controls; and at 1 month of age they exhibited cancellous and cortical bone osteopenia. As the mice matured, cancellous bone volume was restored partially in male but not female mice, whereas cortical osteopenia persisted in both sexes. Cancellous bone histomorphometry revealed an increased number of osteoclasts and bone resorption, without a decrease in osteoblast number or bone formation. Osteoblast differentiation and function were not affected in Notch2Q2319X cells. The pre-osteoclast cell pool, osteoclast differentiation, and bone resorption in response to receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand in vitro were increased in Notch2Q2319X mutants. These effects were suppressed by the γ-secretase inhibitor LY450139. In conclusion, Notch2Q2319X mice exhibit cancellous and cortical bone osteopenia, enhanced osteoclastogenesis, and increased bone resorption.

Hajdu Cheney syndrome is a devastating disease characterized by focal bone lysis of distal phalanges and by generalized osteoporosis (25Cheney W.D. Acro-Osteolysis.Am. J. Roentgenol. Radium. Ther.

Hajdu Cheney syndrome is transmitted as an autosomal dominant disease, although sporadic cases occur. Whole exome sequencing in families affected by Hajdu Cheney syndrome revealed the presence of point mutations or short deletions in exon 34 of NOTCH2 leading to the creation of a stop codon and the premature termination of the protein product upstream from the PEST (proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S), and (T) threonine) domain (27Gray M.J.

Mutations in NOTCH2 in patients with Hajdu-Cheney syndrome.Osteoporos. Int. 2013; 24: 2275-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Because the PEST domain is necessary for the ubiquitinylation and degradation of Notch, the mutations lead to a stable NICD protein and persistence of NOTCH2 signaling because the sequences required for the formation of the Notch transcriptional complex are preserved (Fig. 1). Despite the pronounced skeletal abnormalities reported in Hajdu Cheney syndrome, little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying the bone loss or the effects of Notch2 gain-of-function in the skeleton. Information obtained from iliac crest bone biopsies has been inconclusive and reported in a small number of subjects with Hajdu Cheney syndrome (32Udell J. Schumacher Jr., H.R. Kaplan F.

To this end, we created a mouse model reproducing the NOTCH2 mutation (6949C→T) found in a subject affected by the disease and presenting with pronounced osteoporosis and fractures (28Isidor B. Lindenbaum P. Pichon O. Bézieau S. Dina C. Jacquemont S. Martin-Coignard D. Thauvin-Robinet C. Le Merrer M. Mandel J.L. David A. Faivre L. Cormier-Daire V. Redon R. Le Caignec C.

To create a Hajdu Cheney syndrome mutant mouse, we introduced the human NOTCH2 mutation of 6949C→T into the corresponding base of the mouse Notch2 (6955C→T) gene, creating a stop codon in exon 34 and leading to a Q2319X change at the amino acid level with a truncated Notch2 protein of 2318 amino acids (Fig. 1). In this study, we define the skeletal phenotype of Notch2Q2319X mutant mice and the mechanisms responsible. To create a mouse model of Hajdu Cheney syndrome, we reproduced the mutation reported in a subject with the disease (28Isidor B. Lindenbaum P. Pichon O. Bézieau S. Dina C. Jacquemont S.

In the individual, a C at nucleotide 6949 from the translational start of NOTCH2 mutated into a T (6949C→T) leading to the creation of a premature stop codon in exon 34. The mutation corresponding to the 6949C→T substitution (6955C→T) was introduced into the mouse Notch2 locus by homologous recombination. A targeting vector containing 4.6 kb of 5′-homology arm from exon 30 to exon 33 of Notch2, a phosphoglycerate kinase promoter-driven neomycin (neo) selection cassette flanked by loxP sites ∼400 nucleotides upstream of exon 34, a 6955C→T mutation, and a 3′-homology arm of 3.0 kb, was used (Fig. 1). Embryonic (ES) cells from 129Sv/C57BL/6j embryos were electroporated, and G418-resistant colonies were selected. Targeted clones were verified by long range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of genomic DNA. To ensure proper integration of the 5′-homology arm, we used forward F1 5′-GGTTGACAGGTGATGCAGTGCCAG-3′ and reverse R1 5′-GGCTGGACGTAAACTCCTCTTCAG-3′ primers followed by nested forward F2 5′-GCACATACCACACGGTCAGCTGAG-3′ and reverse R25′-GATCGGAATTGGGCTGCAGGAATT-3′ primers. To ensure proper integration of the 3′-homology arm, forward F3 5′-GGCTTCTGAGGCGGAAAGAACCAG-3′ and reverse R3 5′-CAATGGGGAGCCGTCATCATCGG-3′ primers were used (Fig. 1B). The presence of the 6955C→T mutation in the selected clone was confirmed by DNA sequencing (GENEWIZ, South Plainfield, NJ) (Fig. 1). Targeted ES clones were used for aggregations to generate chimeric mice at the Gene Targeting and Transgenic Facility of University of Connecticut Health Center. Chimeric male mice were bred with female mice expressing Cre under the control of the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt) promoter to remove the PGKneo cassette (36Tang S.H.

The removal of the cassette was verified by PCR, and the Hprt-Cre transgene was segregated by crossing with C57BL/6j wild type mice. Genomic DNA was obtained from ear punches of F1 pups, and the Notch2 mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing (GENEWIZ) as shown in Fig. 1C. Genotyping of Notch2Q2319X mice was conducted in tail DNA extracts by PCR using forward primer Nch2Lox gtF5′-CCCTTCTCTCTGTGCGGTAG-3′ and reverse primer Nch2Lox gtR 5′-CTCAGAGCCAAAGCCTCACTG-3′. In this study, we characterized 129Sv/C57BL/6j mutant mice and sex-matched littermate controls obtained by crossing heterozygous Notch2Q2319X Hajdu Cheney mutants with wild type mice. Studies were approved by the Institutional Animal and Care Use Committees of Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center and University of Connecticut Health Center. Bone microarchitecture of femurs from experimental and control mice was determined using a microcomputed tomography instrument (μCT 40; Scanco Medical AG, Bassersdorf, Switzerland), which was calibrated periodically using a phantom provided by the manufacturer (37Bouxsein M.L.

Femurs were scanned in 70% ethanol at high resolution, energy level of 55 peak kV, intensity of 145 μA, and integration time of 200 ms. A total of 100 slices at midshaft and 160 slices at the distal metaphysis were acquired at an isotropic voxel size of 216 μm3 and a slice thickness of 6 μm and were chosen for analysis. Trabecular bone volume fraction and microarchitecture were evaluated starting ∼1.0 mm proximal from the femoral condyles. Contours were manually drawn every 10 slices a few voxels away from the endocortical boundary to define the region of interest for analysis. The remaining slice contours were iterated automatically. Trabecular regions were assessed for total volume, bone volume, bone volume fraction (bone volume/total volume), trabecular thickness, trabecular number, trabecular separation, connectivity density, and structure model index, using a Gaussian filter (σ = 0.8) and user-defined thresholds (37Bouxsein M.L.

For analysis of femoral cortical bone, contours were iterated across 100 slices along the cortical shell of the femoral midshaft, excluding the marrow cavity. Analysis of bone volume/total volume, porosity, cortical thickness, total cross-sectional and cortical bone area, periosteal perimeter, endosteal perimeter, and material density was performed using a Gaussian filter (σ = 0.8, support = 1), and user defined thresholds. Static and dynamic cancellous bone histomorphometry was carried out on experimental and control mice after they were injected with calcein, 20 mg/kg, and demeclocycline, 50 mg/kg, at an interval of 2 days in 1-month-old or of 5 days in 3-month-old animals. Five micron longitudinal sections of undecalcified femurs embedded in methyl methacrylate were cut on a microtome (Microm, Richards-Allan Scientific, Kalamazoo, MI) and stained with 0.1% toluidine blue or von Kossa. Static parameters of bone formation and resorption were measured in a defined area between 360 and 2160 μm from the growth plate, using an OsteoMeasure morphometry system (Osteometrics, Atlanta, GA). For dynamic histomorphometry, mineralizing surface per bone surface and mineral apposition rate were measured on unstained sections under ultraviolet light, using a triple diamidino-2-phenylindole/fluorescein/Texas red set long pass filter, and bone formation rate was calculated. For cortical histomorphometry, femurs from 1- and 3-month-old mice were embedded in methyl methacrylate and cut through the mid-diaphysis with an EXAKT Precision Saw. Slides were ground using an EXAKT 400 CS micro grinding system to a thickness of ∼15 μm and surface-polished. Cortical sections were processed either in-house or at Alizee Pathology (Baltimore, MD). Slides were left unstained for fluorescence microscopy or stained with hematoxylin/eosin to establish cellular parameters and analyzed at a magnification of ×400 using OsteoMeasureXP software. Stained sections were used to draw the cortical bone, marrow space, osteoid, and cell surfaces as well as to count osteocytes within the cortex and osteoblasts and osteoclasts along the endocortical surface. Data from 1-month-old mice were generated from an all-inclusive cortical section, whereas data from 3-month-old mice were obtained from approximately half of a cortical section. Osteocyte number was expressed as cells/bone area measured. The terminology and units used for cancellous and cortical bone are those recommended by the Histomorphometry Nomenclature Committee of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (39Dempster D.W.

Serum levels of C-terminal collagen cross-links, procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase form 5b (TRACP5b) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Immunodiagnostic Systems, Bolton, England). Serum from Notch2Q2319X and control littermate mice was obtained following an overnight fast, and assays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The parietal bones of 3–5-day-old control and Notch2Q2319X mutant mice were exposed to type II collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum (Worthington) pretreated with N-α-tosyl-l-lysyl-chloromethyl ketone hydrochloride at 17 μg/ml (Calbiochem) (41Hefley T.

Transfections were conducted in cells cultured to 70% confluence using X-tremeGENE 9 (1.5 μl of X-tremeGENE 9:1 μg of DNA), according to manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). A construct where the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter directs the expression of β-galactosidase (CMV/β-galactosidase; Clontech) was used to correct for transfection efficiency. Cells were exposed to the X-tremeGENE 9/DNA mix for 16 h, and the medium was replaced after 24 h. Subsequently, cells were harvested in reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and lysed by freezing at −80 °C and thawing at 37 °C. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined, respectively, with the luciferase assay system kit (Promega) and galacton plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) in accordance with manufacturer's instructions on an Optocomp luminometer (MGM Instruments, Hamden, CT).

Fcγ receptors (FcγR) on immune cells such as macrophages play an important role in tumor-specific antibody-mediated immune responses, but many such responses involve Btk. Here we tested the effects of ibrutinib on FcγR-mediated activities in monocytes. We found that ibrutinib did not affect monocyte FcγR-mediated phagocytosis, even at concentrations higher than those achieved physiologically, but suppressed FcγR-mediated cytokine production. We confirmed these findings in macrophages from Xid mice in which Btk signaling is defective. Because calcium flux is a major event downstream of Btk, we tested whether it was involved in phagocytosis. The results showed that blocking intracellular calcium flux decreased FcγR-mediated cytokine production but not phagocytosis. To verify this, we measured activation of the GTPase Rac, which is responsible for actin polymerization. Results showed that ibrutinib did not inhibit Rac activation, nor did the calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester). We next asked whether the effect of ibrutinib on monocyte FcγR-mediated cytokine production could be rescued by IFNγ priming because NK cells produce IFNγ in response to antibody therapy. Pretreatment of monocytes with IFNγ abrogated the effects of ibrutinib on FcγR-mediated cytokine production, suggesting that IFNγ priming could overcome this Btk inhibition. Furthermore, in monocyte-natural killer cell co-cultures, ibrutinib did not inhibit FcγR-mediated cytokine production despite doing so in single cultures. These results suggest that combining ibrutinib with monoclonal antibody therapy could enhance chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell killing without affecting macrophage effector function.

https://openalex.org/W2186191745,"The role of dietary fiber in supporting healthy gut microbiota and overall well-being of the host has been revealed in several studies. Here, we show the effect of a bacterial polyfructan levan on the growth dynamics and metabolism of fecal microbiota in vitro by using isothermal microcalorimetry. Eleven fecal samples from healthy donors were incubated in phosphate-buffered defined medium with or without levan supplementation and varying presence of amino acids. The generation of heat, changes in pH and microbiota composition, concentrations of produced and consumed metabolites during the growth were determined. The composition of fecal microbiota and profile of metabolites changed in response to substrate (levan and amino acids) availability. The main products of levan metabolism were acetic, lactic, butyric, propionic and succinic acids and carbon dioxide. Associated growth of levan-degrading (e.g. Bacteroides) and butyric acid-producing (e.g. Faecalibacterium) taxa was observed in levan-supplemented media. The study shows that the capacity of levan and possibly also other dietary fibers/prebiotics to modulate the composition and function of colon microbiota can be predicted by using isothermal microcalorimetry of fecal samples linked to metabolite and consortia analyses."

Here, we show that post-translational regulation of the transcription factors ETV1, ETV4, and ETV5 by the ubiquitin ligase COP1 (also called RFWD2) in β cells is critical for insulin secretion. Mice lacking COP1 in β cells developed diabetes due to insulin granule docking defects that were fully rescued by genetic deletion of Etv1, Etv4, and Etv5. Genes regulated by ETV1, ETV4, or ETV5 in the absence of mouse COP1 were enriched in human diabetes-associated genes, suggesting that they also influence human β-cell pathophysiology. In normal β cells, ETV4 was stabilized upon membrane depolarization and limited insulin secretion under hyperglycemic conditions. Collectively, our data reveal that ETVs negatively regulate insulin secretion for the maintenance of normoglycemia."

The response rate was 88.8%, with 5,329 students completing the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Family Environment Scale Chinese Version (FES-CV), which was adapted for the Chinese population. Differences between the groups were tested for significance by the Student's t-test; ANOVA was used to test continuous variables. The relationship between soft family environmental factors and BDI were tested by Pearson correlation analysis. Hierarchical linear regression analysis was conducted to model the effects of hard environmental factors and soft environmental factors on depression in university students.A total of 11.8% of students scored above the threshold of moderate depression (BDI≧14). Hard family environmental factors such as parent relationship, family economic status, level of parental literacy and non-intact family structure were associated with depressive symptoms. The soft family environmental factors--conflict and control--were positively associated with depression, while cohesion was negatively related to depressive symptom after controlling for other important associates of depression. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that the soft family environment correlates more strongly with depression than the hard family environment.Soft family environmental factors--especially cohesion, conflict and control--appeared to play an important role in the occurrence of depressive symptoms. These findings underline the significance of the family environment as a source of risk factors for depression among university students in China and suggest that family-based interventions and improvement are very important to reduce depression among university students."

We demonstrate reactive oxygen species-mediated activation of AMP-activated kinase in Huh7.5 cells during HCV (JFH-1)-induced growth arrest. Metabolic labeling experiments provided direct evidence that lipid synthesis is attenuated, and β-oxidation is enhanced in these cells. A striking increase in nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α, which plays a dominant role in the expression of β-oxidation genes after ligand-induced activation, was also observed, and we provide evidence that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α is constitutively activated in these cells. The combination of attenuated lipid synthesis and enhanced β-oxidation is not conducive to lipid accumulation, yet cellular lipids still accumulated during this stage of infection. Notably, the serum in the culture media was the only available source for polyunsaturated fatty acids, which were elevated (2-fold) in the infected cells, implicating altered lipid import/export pathways in these cells.

Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) is considered a conserved endogenous ligand for TSPO. In bacteria, TSPO was identified to regulate tetrapyrrole metabolism and chemical catalysis of PPIX in the presence of light, and in vertebrates, TSPO function has been linked to porphyrin transport and heme biosynthesis. Positive correlation between high TSPO expression in cancer cells and susceptibility to photodynamic therapy based on their increased ability to convert the precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to PPIX appeared to reinforce this mechanism. In this study, we used TSPO knock-out (Tspo−/−) mice, primary cells, and different tumor cell lines to examine the role of TSPO in erythropoiesis, heme levels, PPIX biosynthesis, phototoxic cell death, and mitochondrial bioenergetic homeostasis. In contrast to expectations, our results demonstrate that TSPO deficiency does not adversely affect erythropoiesis, heme biosynthesis, bioconversion of ALA to PPIX, and porphyrin-mediated phototoxic cell death. TSPO expression levels in cancer cells do not correlate with their ability to convert ALA to PPIX. In fibroblasts, we observed that TSPO deficiency decreased the oxygen consumption rate and mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) indicative of a cellular metabolic shift, without a negative impact on porphyrin biosynthetic capability.

https://openalex.org/W2182272691,"Cellular respiration depletes stored carbohydrates during extended periods of limited photosynthesis, e.g. winter dormancy or drought. As respiration rate is largely a function of temperature, the thermal conditions during such periods may affect non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) availability and, ultimately, recovery. Here, we surveyed stem responses to temperature changes in 15 woody species. For two species with divergent respirational response to frost, P. integerrima and P. trichocarpa, we also examined corresponding changes in NSC levels. Finally, we simulated respiration-induced NSC depletion using historical temperature data for the western US. We report a novel finding that tree stems significantly increase respiration in response to near freezing temperatures. We observed this excess respiration in 13 of 15 species, deviating 10% to 170% over values predicted by the Arrhenius equation. Excess respiration persisted at temperatures above 0 °C during warming and reoccurred over multiple frost-warming cycles. A large adjustment of NSCs accompanied excess respiration in P. integerrima, whereas P. trichocarpa neither excessively respired nor adjusted NSCs. Over the course of the years included in our model, frost-induced respiration accelerated stem NSC consumption by 8.4 mg (glucose eq.) cm(-3) yr(-1) on average in the western US, a level of depletion that may continue to significantly affect spring NSC availability. This novel finding revises the current paradigm of low temperature respiration kinetics."

Selection of IgG variants with increased FcRn binding using random and directed mutagenesis: impact on effector functions.Front. Immunol. 2015; 6: 39Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)? Currently, there is no proposed mechanism by which a reduction in the stability of the unbound IgG with pH contributes to an increase in FcRn affinity. The idea that differences in sub-global Fc domain stability prior to binding FcRn might influence affinity has not been explored. In fact, the locations of structural regions in the Fc domain sensitive to pH are also unknown. Does pH reduction cause sub-global Fc domain destabilization in a manner that could influence FcRn affinity? If so, how do conformational dynamics prior to binding FcRn relate to binding affinity? To address this, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of the role of protein dynamics on the pH-dependent affinity of the IgG-FcRn complex by measuring the HX rates of a wild-type IgG1 antibody (WT) and its cognate YTE mutant (YTE) at both pH 7 and pH 5.5±FcRn. We account for changes in hydroxide concentrations on HX rates, enabling a direct assessment of the change in local Fc domain stability as a function of pH. In doing so, pH dependence profiles for structural free energy are constructed between WT and YTE in the absence of FcRn along with the stability conferred to each molecule upon binding FcRn. Magnitudes of changes in structural free energy between all relevant states (pH 7, pH 5.5±FcRn) and between molecules, WT and YTE, are compared with SPR affinity measurements to explore whether pH-sensitive changes to conformational dynamics in the absence of FcRn play any causal role in pH-dependent FcRn affinity. Measurements show that in the presence of FcRn, the conformational dynamics of WT and YTE are nearly indistinguishable, suggesting that changes in affinity are the result of differences in stability prior to binding FcRn. Every structural element stabilized by binding FcRn is also destabilized by pH reduction in both molecules, suggesting that increased mobility, prior to binding FcRn, is indeed a determinant for affinity. The particular structural locations identified as sensitive to pH and FcRn binding allow us to propose that pH-driven destabilization increases affinity for FcRn by breaking specific intramolecular backbone H-bonds known to form intermolecular contacts with FcRn along with increasing side-chain adaptability in all residues that are known to reorient upon binding FcRn. To our knowledge, this work is the first to suggest a mechanism by which pH-induced destabilization increases affinity for the FcRn receptor. Mass analysis was performed on WT and YTE for native and deglycosylated forms after reduction. Each antibody was deglycosylated by adding N-glycosidase F in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.1, to a substrate/enzyme ratio of 0.14 unit/μg of mAb and then incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Both native and deglycosylated WT and YTE were reduced using 0.2 m tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) in 4 m guanidinium chloride at 37 °C for 30 min and desalted by size exclusion chromatography. Electrospray ionization mass spectra were acquired on a maXis Q-TOF (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a TriVersa NanoMate (Advion, Ithaca, NY). For data evaluation, software developed in-house was used. This verified that both WT and YTE had expected masses and the same glycan distributions, reported in Table 1.TABLE 1Glycan composition of WT and YTE molecules in this studyGlycoformWTYTE%%No glycan69G0 + fucose5952G1 + fucose2932G2 + fucose77 Open table in a new tab A Biacore T200 SPR spectrometer was utilized to determine the binding strength of WT and YTE antibodies at pH 5.5 and pH 7.0. Prior to the actual assay, a CM5 sensor chip was prepared by immobilizing about 50 response units of scFcRn 5scFcRn indicates single-chain FcRn, which is FcRn and β2-microglobulin fused together as a single polypeptide chain. This prevents dissociation of the FcRn complex. (low density) onto flow cell two, about 400 response units of scFcRn onto flow cell three, and about 4000 response units of scFcRn onto flow cell four (high density), via amine coupling chemistry (BR-1000-50, GE Healthcare) at pH 4.5. Flow cell one was immobilized as a blank to be used as reference. A PBS-P+ (28-9950-84, GE Healthcare), pH 5.5, buffer was connected to the “buffer A” tubing, and a PBS-P+, pH 7.0, buffer was connected to the “buffer B” tubing of the Biacore instrument. The assay consisted of two identical steps, of which one was carried out with buffer A and the other was carried out with buffer B. Each cycle consisted of a sample association (200 s, 50 μl/min), a sample dissociation (600 s, 50 μl/min), and two 30-s-long regeneration steps with PBS-P+, pH 8.8, at a flow speed of 30 μl/min. All samples were diluted independently for both steps in the corresponding running buffer. The sample set for each assay step included a 1:2 dilution series ranging from 1000 to 0.49 nm of the WT and YTE antibody variant. The soluble extracellular domain of FcRn with His-Avi-Tag® associated with β-2-microglubulin was immobilized onto POROS® streptavidin beads that were packed into a 300-μl column (22Schlothauer T.

Approximately 30 μg of IgG was loaded in 20 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.0, where it was washed and eluted by pH gradient: 100% mobile phase A to 66% mobile phase B in 5 min; to 75% mobile phase B and 25% mobile phase C in 5 min; to 15% mobile phase B and 75% mobile phase C in 20 min; to 100% mobile phase C in 8 min; hold 100% mobile phase C for 9 min; to 100% mobile phase A in 2 min; hold 100% mobile phase A for 12 min.

Samples (30 μm IgG) were diluted 1:15 into a solution of D2O containing 20 mm histidine, 50 mm NaCl, at either pD 5.5 or pD 7.0, and allowed to exchange for seven time intervals from 0.5 to 1000 min. Time points taken in triplicate were randomized and collected by the LEAPv1 HX robotics platform (Leap Technologies, Carrboro, NC). For FcRn-bound experiments, IgG and FcRn were mixed at a 1:7 ratio and allowed to sit on the bench for 30 min before beginning labeling as described previously (23Jensen P.F. Larraillet V.

H-bonds sequester protons from exchange with solvent, and thus observed deuterium uptake rates under native conditions are dictated by H-bond opening rates (kop) and reformation rates (kcl). The influences of changes in H-bond equilibria (kop/kcl) on HX uptake rates are well understood and have been discussed previously (34Skinner J.J. Lim W.K. Bédard S. Black B.E. Englander S.W.

We utilized these principles and developed a method to approximate changes in H-bond equilibria at the peptide level from HX MS data. To quantify approximate changes in H-bond equilibria between any two experimental conditions, C1 and C2, from changes in deuterium uptake traces at the peptide level, we computed peptide protection factors (PFC1→C2) by comparing the amount of time required for equivalent deuterium incorporation between experimental conditions. In thermodynamic terms, taking Kcl = kcl/kop to represent the association constant for H-bonds, PFC1→C2, scales changes from one condition to the other by Kcl,C1 × PFC1→C2 ≅ Kcl,C1 in the same way as an increase in affinity, represented by Ka,C1→C2, scales association constants between two conditions by Ka,C1 × Ka,C1→C2 = Ka,C2. Peptide protection factors are directly related to changes in free energy by ΔΔGC1→C2 = −RTln(PFC1→C2). An extended mathematical synthesis to establish the validity of our approach and a visual diagram that delineates each step of the PFC1→C2 computation for peptide level HX are given in the supplemental text.

This study uses a pre-test-training-post-test design to evaluate the effects of a training program based on letter-speech sound associations with a special focus on gains in reading fluency. A sample of 44 children with dyslexia and 23 typical readers, aged 8 to 9, was recruited. Children with dyslexia were randomly allocated to either the training program group (n = 23) or a waiting-list control group (n = 21). The training intensively focused on letter-speech sound mapping and consisted of 34 individual sessions of 45 minutes over a five month period. The children with dyslexia showed substantial reading gains for the main word reading and spelling measures after training, improving at a faster rate than typical readers and waiting-list controls. The results are interpreted within the conceptual framework assuming a multisensory integration deficit as the most proximal cause of dysfluent reading in dyslexia.ISRCTN register ISRCTN12783279."
https://openalex.org/W2185468729,"Preclinical and clinical studies have previously shown that systemic administration of GM1 ganglioside has neuroprotective and neurorestorative properties in Parkinson's disease (PD) models and in PD patients. However, the clinical development of GM1 for PD has been hampered by its animal origin (GM1 used in previous studies was extracted from bovine brains), limited bioavailability, and limited blood brain barrier penetrance following systemic administration.To assess an alternative therapeutic approach to systemic administration of brain-derived GM1 to enhance GM1 levels in the brain via enzymatic conversion of polysialogangliosides into GM1 and to assess the neuroprotective potential of this approach.We used sialidase from Vibrio cholerae (VCS) to convert GD1a, GD1b and GT1b gangliosides to GM1. VCS was infused by osmotic minipump into the dorsal third ventricle in mice over a 4-week period. After the first week of infusion, animals received MPTP injections (20 mg/kg, s.c., twice daily, 4 hours apart, for 5 consecutive days) and were euthanized 2 weeks after the last injection.VCS infusion resulted in the expected change in ganglioside expression with a significant increase in GM1 levels. VCS-treated animals showed significant sparing of striatal dopamine (DA) levels and substantia nigra DA neurons following MPTP administration, with the extent of sparing of DA neurons similar to that achieved with systemic GM1 administration.The results suggest that enzymatic conversion of polysialogangliosides to GM1 may be a viable treatment strategy for increasing GM1 levels in the brain and exerting a neuroprotective effect on the damaged nigrostriatal DA system."

A more differentiated approach at determining the co-occurrence of physical activity and media use behaviors within subjects may be warranted. The aim of this study was to determine the co-occurrence of physical activity and media use by identifying clusters of adolescents with specific behavior patterns including physical activity in various settings (school, sports club, leisure time) and different types of media use (watching TV, playing console games, using PC / Internet).Cross-sectional data of 2,083 adolescents (11-17 years) from all over Germany were collected between 2009 and 2012 in the Motorik-Modul Study. Physical activity and media use were self-reported. Cluster analyses (Ward's method and K-means analysis) were used to identify behavior patterns of boys and girls separately.Eight clusters were identified for boys and seven for girls. The clusters demonstrated that a high proportion of boys (33%) as well as girls (42%) show low engagement in both physical activity and media use, irrespective of setting or type of media. Other adolescents are engaged in both behaviors, but either physical activity (35% of boys, 27% of girls) or media use (31% of boys and girls) predominates. These adolescents belong to different clusters, whereat in most clusters either one specific setting of physical activity or a specific combination of different types of media predominates.The results of this study support to some extent the hypothesis that media use and physical activity compete: Very high media use occurred with low physical activity behavior, but very high activity levels co-occurred with considerable amounts of time using any media. There was no evidence that type of used media was related to physical activity levels, neither setting of physical activity was related to amount of media use in any pattern."

Similar to FL CFTR, F508del NBD1 expression was reduced 50–60% by Hsp27; it interacted preferentially with the mutant and was modified primarily by SUMO-2. Mutation of the consensus SUMOylation site, Lys447, obviated Hsp27-mediated F508del NBD1 SUMOylation and degradation. As for FL CFTR and NBD1 in vivo, SUMO modification using purified components in vitro was greater for F508del NBD1 versus WT and for the SUMO-2 paralog. Several findings indicated that Hsp27-Ubc9 targets the SUMOylation of a transitional, non-native conformation of F508del NBD1: (a) its modification decreased as [ATP] increased, reflecting stabilization of the nucleotide-binding domain by ligand binding; (b) a temperature-induced increase in intrinsic fluorescence, which reflects formation of a transitional NBD1 conformation, was followed by its SUMO modification; and (c) introduction of solubilizing or revertant mutations to stabilize F508del NBD1 reduced its SUMO modification. These findings indicate that the Hsp27-Ubc9 pathway recognizes a non-native conformation of mutant NBD1, which leads to its SUMO-2 conjugation and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. A newly identified pathway for selective degradation of the common mutant of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), F508del, is initiated by binding of the small heat shock protein, Hsp27. Hsp27 collaborates with Ubc9, the E2 enzyme for protein SUMOylation, to selectively degrade F508del CFTR via the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin E3 ligase, RNF4 (RING finger protein 4) (1Ahner A. Gong X.

To map the inactive and active dimeric orientations of the TM helices, we performed asparagine (Asn)-scanning mutagenesis of the TM domains of the murine and human TpoR. Substitution of Asn at only one position (S505N) activated the human receptor, whereas Asn substitutions at several positions activated the murine receptor. Second site mutational studies indicate that His499 near the N terminus of the TM domain is responsible for protecting the human receptor from activation by Asn mutations. Structural studies reveal that the sequence preceding His499 is helical in the murine receptor but non-helical in peptides corresponding to the TM domain of the inactive human receptor. The activating S505N mutation and the small molecule agonist eltrombopag both induce helix in this region of the TM domain and are associated with dimerization and activation of the human receptor. Thus, His499 regulates the activation of human TpoR and provides additional protection against activating mutations, such as oncogenic Asn mutations in the TM domain.

This study explored seasonal variations of soil respiration and its controlling biochemical properties under a gradient of Nitrogen addition during two consecutive winter wheat growing seasons (2013-2015). N was applied at four different levels: 0, 120, 180 and 240 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) (denoted as N0, N12, N18 and N24, respectively). Soil respiration exhibited significant seasonal variation and was significantly affected by soil temperature with Q10 ranging from 2.04 to 2.46 and from 1.49 to 1.53 during 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 winter wheat growing season, respectively. Soil moisture had no significant effect on soil respiration during 2013-2014 winter wheat growing season but showed a significant and negative correlation with soil respiration during 2014-2015 winter wheat growing season. Soil respiration under N24 treatment was significantly higher than N0 treatment. Averaged over the two growing seasons, N12, N18 and N24 significantly increased soil respiration by 13.4, 16.4 and 25.4% compared with N0, respectively. N addition also significantly increased easily extractable glomalin-related soil protein (EEG), soil organic carbon (SOC), total N, ammonium N and nitrate N contents. In addition, soil respiration was significantly and positively correlated with β-glucosidase activity, EEG, SOC, total N, ammonium N and nitrate N contents. The results indicated that high N fertilization improved soil chemical properties, but significantly increased soil respiration."

Using data from the Korea Health Panel survey, we examined the relationship between quality of life measured by EQ-5D and work status among Korean adults. We also tested whether and how the relationship between quality of life and work status differed by gender. Quality of life among working adults was better than among non-working adults. The gap between the two groups was larger among male than female participants. Further, the gender differential effect was larger in the 41-60-year-old age group than in the 18-40-year-old and 61-or-older groups. Being employed has a positive relation to quality of life among adults. Work status plays a more important role in quality of life for men than for women, especially for the working elderly men than working elderly women."
https://openalex.org/W2183529531,"Landscapes and features of the everyday world were scarcely represented in Paleolithic art, especially those features associated with the human landscape (huts and campsites). On the contrary, other figurative motifs (especially animals) and signs, traditionally linked to the magic or religious conceptions of these hunter-gatherer societies, are the predominant themes of Upper Paleolithic art. This paper seeks to present an engraved schist slab recently found in the Molí del Salt site (North-eastern Iberia) and dated at the end of the Upper Paleolithic, ca. 13,800 years ago. This slab displays seven semicircular motifs that may be interpreted as the representation of dome-shaped huts. The analysis of individual motifs and the composition, as well as the ethnographic and archeological contextualization, suggests that this engraving is a naturalistic depiction of a hunter-gatherer campsite. Campsites can be considered the first human landscape, the first area of land whose visible features were entirely constructed by humans. Given the social meaning of campsites in hunter-gatherer life-styles, this engraving may be considered one of the first representations of the domestic and social space of a human group."
https://openalex.org/W2194332833,"Unintended pregnancy accounts for more than 40% of the total pregnancies worldwide. An Unintended pregnancy can have serious implications on women and their families. With more than one-fourth of the children in India born out of unintended pregnancies such pregnancies are considered to be one of the major public health concerns today. The present study is aimed at determining major predictors of unintended pregnancy among currently pregnant ever-married women in India. The present study has used National Family Health Survey (NFHS) data, conducted by the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), Mumbai, to show the trend, pattern and determinants of mistimed and unwanted pregnancies. Bivariate and multinomial logistic regression model have been used with the help of Stata 13 software. The results show that the likelihood of a mistimed pregnancy is more prevalent among young women whereas the prevalence of unwanted pregnancy is observed more among the women aged 35 years or more. The results also show that the risk of experiencing mistimed pregnancy decreases if the woman belongs to 'other' castes and has higher education. The likelihood of unwanted pregnancy decreases among married women aged 18 years and above, those women having higher education, some autonomy and access to any mode of mass communication. Knowledge of these predictors of mistimed and unwanted pregnancy will be helpful in identifying the most vulnerable group and prioritize the intervention strategies of the reproductive health programmes for the population in need."

We sought to assess the association between PI use and the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the anus (SCCA) in HIV-infected individuals. We performed a retrospective cohort study among male US veterans diagnosed with HIV who were diagnosed between 1985 and 2010, using the Veterans Affairs HIV Clinical Case Registry (CCR). We calculated hazards ratios associated with PI use (both as percent time on PI and as 12-month intervals of PI use), utilizing time-dependent Cox models. We adjusted for risk factors, including age, race, year of enrolment into CCR, recent and nadir CD4, and percent time undetectable HIV viral load. A total of 28, 886 HIV-infected men met inclusion criteria. Of these, 373 were newly diagnosed with SCCA during the study period. In multivariate analysis, increasing percent time on PIs was associated with an increased risk of SCCA (aHR 1.07; 95% CI = 1.03–1.10 per 10% increase in time on PI). Poor immunologic recovery and virologic control, a history of condylomata acuminata, and CCR enrolment in the late combined antiretroviral therapy era were also associated with increased SCCA risk. Increasing percent time on a PI-based combined antiretroviral therapy regimen may be associated with an increased risk of developing SCCA in HIV-infected male US veterans. Future studies, better accounting for HIV control and treatment compliance, are necessary to further clarify this association."
https://openalex.org/W2189085448,"Conventional wisdom holds that only one of the two strands in a micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) precursor duplex is selected as the active miRNA guide strand. The complementary miRNA passenger strand, however, is thought to be inactive. High levels of the oncogenic miRNA (oncomiR) guide strand called miR-17-5p is overexpressed in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and can inhibit ribosomal translation of tumor suppressor gene mRNAs, such as programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) or phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). We hypothesized that knocking down the oncogenic microRNA (oncomiR) miR-17-5p might restore the expression levels of PDCD4 and PTEN tumor suppressor proteins, illustrating a route to oligonucleotide therapy of TNBC. Contrary to conventional wisdom, antisense knockdown of oncomiR miR-17-5p guide strand reduced PDCD4 and PTEN proteins by 1.8±0.3 fold in human TNBC cells instead of raising them. Bioinformatics analysis and folding energy calculations revealed that mRNA targets of miR-17-5p guide strand, such as PDCD4 and PTEN, could also be regulated by miR-17-3p passenger strand. Due to high sequence homology between the antisense molecules and miR-17-3p passenger strand, as well as the excess binding sites for the passenger strand on the 3’UTR of PDCD4 and PTEN mRNAs, introducing a miR-17-3p DNA-LNA mimic to knock down miR-17-5p reduced PDCD4 and PTEN protein expression instead of raising them. Our results imply that therapeutic antisense sequences against miRNAs should be designed to target the miRNA strand with the greatest number of putative binding sites in the target mRNAs, while minimizing affinity for the minor strand."
https://openalex.org/W2190709444,"A sequence of complex conformational changes is required for insulin to bind to the insulin receptor. Recent experimental evidence points to the B chain C-terminal (BC-CT) as the location of these changes in insulin. Here, we present molecular dynamics simulations of insulin that reveal new insights into the structural changes occurring in the BC-CT. We find three key results: 1) The opening of the BC-CT is inherently stochastic and progresses through an open and then a ""wide-open"" conformation--the wide-open conformation is essential for receptor binding, but occurs only rarely. 2) The BC-CT opens with a zipper-like mechanism, with a hinge at the Phe24 residue, and is maintained in the dominant closed/inactive state by hydrophobic interactions of the neighboring Tyr26, the critical residue where opening of the BC-CT (activation of insulin) is initiated. 3) The mutation Y26N is a potential candidate as a therapeutic insulin analogue. Overall, our results suggest that the binding of insulin to its receptor is a highly dynamic and stochastic process, where initial docking occurs in an open conformation and full binding is facilitated through interactions of insulin receptor residues with insulin in its wide-open conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2188527342,"The difference between total serum protein and albumin, i.e. the gamma gap, is a frequently used clinical screening measure for both latent infection and malignancy. However, there are no studies defining a positive gamma gap. Further, whether it is an independent risk factor of mortality is unknown.This study examined the association between gamma gap, all-cause mortality, and specific causes of death (cardiovascular, cancer, pulmonary, or other) in 12,260 participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999-2004. Participants had a comprehensive metabolic panel measured, which was linked with vital status data from the National Death Index. Cause of death was based on ICD10 codes from death certificates. Analyses were performed with Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for mortality risk factors. The mean (SE) age was 46 (0.3) years and the mean gamma gap was 3.0 (0.01) g/dl. The population was 52% women and 10% black. During a median follow-up period of 4.8 years (IQR: 3.3 to 6.2 years), there were 723 deaths. The unadjusted 5-year cumulative incidences across quartiles of the gamma gap (1.7-2.7, 2.8-3.0, 3.1-3.2, and 3.3-7.9 g/dl) were 5.7%, 4.2%, 5.5%, and 7.8%. After adjustment for risk factors, participants with a gamma gap of ≥3.1 g/dl had a 30% higher risk of death compared to participants with a gamma gap <3.1 g/dl (HR: 1.30; 95%CI: 1.08, 1.55; P = 0.006). Gamma gap (per 1.0 g/dl) was most strongly associated with death from pulmonary causes (HR 2.22; 95%CI: 1.19, 4.17; P = 0.01).The gamma gap is an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality at values as low as 3.1 g/dl (in contrast to the traditional definition of 4.0 g/dl), and is strongly associated with death from pulmonary causes. Future studies should examine the biologic pathways underlying these associations."
https://openalex.org/W2265165715,"Extracellular fibrinogen-binding protein (Efb) from Staphylococcus aureus inhibits platelet activation, although its mechanism of action has not been established. In this study, we discovered that the N-terminal region of Efb (Efb-N) promotes platelet binding of fibrinogen and that Efb-N binding to platelets proceeds via two independent mechanisms: fibrinogen-mediated and fibrinogen-independent. By proteomic analysis of Efb-interacting proteins within platelets and confirmation by pulldown assays followed by immunoblotting, we identified P-selectin and multimerin-1 as novel Efb interaction partners. The interaction of both P-selectin and multimerin-1 with Efb is independent of fibrinogen. We focused on Efb interaction with P-selectin. Excess of P-selectin extracellular domain significantly impaired Efb binding by activated platelets, suggesting that P-selectin is the main receptor for Efb on the surface of activated platelets. Efb-N interaction with P-selectin inhibited P-selectin binding to its physiological ligand, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1), both in cell lysates and in cell-free assays. Because of the importance of P-selectin-PSGL-1 binding in the interaction between platelets and leukocytes, we tested human whole blood and found that Efb abolishes the formation of platelet-monocyte and platelet-granulocyte complexes. In summary, we present evidence that in addition to its documented antithrombotic activity, Efb can play an immunoregulatory role via inhibition of P-selectin-PSGL-1-dependent formation of platelet-leukocyte complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2346783774,"KCNQ (voltage-gated K(+) channel family 7 (Kv7)) channels control cellular excitability and underlie the K(+) current sensitive to muscarinic receptor signaling (the M current) in sympathetic neurons. Here we show that the novel anti-epileptic drug retigabine (RTG) modulates channel function of pore-only modules (PMs) of the human Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 homomeric channels and of Kv7.2/3 heteromeric channels by prolonging the residence time in the open state. In addition, the Kv7 channel PMs are shown to recapitulate the single-channel permeation and pharmacological specificity characteristics of the corresponding full-length proteins in their native cellular context. A mutation (W265L) in the reconstituted Kv7.3 PM renders the channel insensitive to RTG and favors the conductive conformation of the PM, in agreement to what is observed when the Kv7.3 mutant is heterologously expressed. On the basis of the new findings and homology models of the closed and open conformations of the Kv7.3 PM, we propose a structural mechanism for the gating of the Kv7.3 PM and for the site of action of RTG as a Kv7.2/Kv7.3 K(+) current activator. The results validate the modular design of human Kv channels and highlight the PM as a high-fidelity target for drug screening of Kv channels."
https://openalex.org/W4291222822,"Sports trauma are able to induce muscle injury with fibrosis and accumulation of intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT), which affect muscle function. This study was designed to investigate whether hypoactivity would influence IMAT accumulation in regenerating mouse skeletal muscle using the glycerol model of muscle regeneration. The animals were immediately hindlimb unloaded for 21 days after glycerol injection into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. Muscle fiber and adipocyte cross-sectional area (CSA) and IMAT accumulation were determined by histomorphometric analysis. Adipogenesis during regenerative processes was examined using RT-qPCR and Western blot quantification. Twenty-one days of hindlimb unloading resulted in decreases of 38% and 50.6% in the muscle weight/body weight ratio and CSA, respectively, in soleus muscle. Glycerol injection into TA induced IMAT accumulation, reaching 3% of control normal-loading muscle area. This IMAT accumulation was largely inhibited in unloading conditions (0.09%) and concomitant with a marked reduction in perilipin and FABP4 protein content, two key markers of mature adipocytes. Induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα mRNA, two markers of adipogenesis, was also decreased. Furthermore, the protein expression of PDGFRα, a cell surface marker of fibro/adipogenic progenitors, was much lower in regenerating TA from the unloaded group. Exposure of regenerating muscle to hypoactivity severely reduces IMAT development and accumulation. These results provide new insight into the mechanisms regulating IMAT development in skeletal muscle and highlight the importance of taking into account the level of mechanical constraint imposed on skeletal muscle during the regeneration processes."

Because the function of CNAγ in the brain has not been examined, the potential role of the PPP3CC gene in schizophrenia has remained unclear. In this study, we show that CNAγ is expressed in adult rodent and human brains, dephosphorylates known presynaptic calcineurin substrates, and is present in presynaptic terminals in the hippocampus. We further show that RNAi-mediated knockdown of CNAγ results in a slowing of synaptic vesicle endocytosis. These data suggest that PPP3CC risk alleles may contribute to schizophrenia pathogenesis by altering synaptic vesicle cycling, adding to evidence implicating presynaptic dysfunction in central nervous system disorders (19Cottrell J.R.

Rabbit polyclonal antisera were generated (Open Biosystems) against peptides unique to the individual calcineurin isoforms (Fig. 1A): CNAα, RRDAMPSDANLNSINK; CNAβ, RKDAVQQDGFNSLNTAH; human CNAγ 1, RKLDRFTEPPAFGPVCDLL; human CNAγ 2, PRKDSIHAGGPMKSVTS; mouse CNAγ, CHPQASRRTDHGKKAL; and rat CNAγ, SYHHDAGKTHPHPSKRSDHGKKAL. Affinity purification of antisera was performed (Open Biosystems). As specified in the text, purified antibodies or the original antisera were used for different assays. For antiserum specificity analysis, human and mouse CNAα, CNAβ, and CNAγ cDNAs were subcloned into the pcDNA-DEST53 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen), which includes an N-terminal cycle 3 GFP tag. The rat CNAγ construct was acquired in the pExpress-1 mammalian expression vector (Open Biosystems) without an epitope tag. Recombinant CNA proteins were generated by transfecting 293T cells in 6-well plates with the expression constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (Sigma) and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants were harvested, and protein concentrations were determined with a bicinchoninic acid kit (Pierce). Protein (30 μg) was solubilized in NuPAGE running buffer and loaded onto 4–12% NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked in 10% milk, and incubated in custom rabbit anti-mouse CNAα, CNAβ, and CNAγ antisera (1:5000) overnight and in secondary antibodies for 1 h in 5% milk/Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% Triton X-100. The secondary antibody was HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were developed with chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and imaged on a Biochemi (UVP). For tissue Western blot analyses, tissue protein samples from adult male BALB/c mice were obtained from a commercial supplier (Biochain) and solubilized in NuPAGE running buffer. Western blot analyses were performed using custom rabbit anti-mouse CNAα, CNAβ, and CNAγ antisera (1:5000) as described above. For brain tissue Western blot analysis of 2-week-old or younger animals, brain tissue from three Swiss-Webster mice of either gender was harvested. For samples from mice older than 2 weeks, brain tissue from three male Swiss-Webster mice was harvested. Western blotting was performed as described above. Human cerebral cortex samples (Asterand) were homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer plus protease inhibitors (Roche) and centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g. Supernatants were incubated with affinity-purified antibody (5 μg) overnight at 4 °C with rocking. Protein A/G-agarose beads (20 μl, Thermo Scientific) were added, and samples were rocked for 1 h. Beads were pelleted and washed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and protein was solubilized with 20 μl of NuPAGE sample buffer. C terminus GFP-tagged constitutively active forms of human CNAα, β, and γ were produced using PCR to generate sequences encoding the catalytic and CNB1 binding domains in pcDNA-DEST53 (Invitrogen). 293T cells in 6-well plates were co-transfected with individual constitutively active calcineurin constructs and a dynamin I cDNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After overnight incubation, protein was extracted from transfected cells using radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and Western blotting was performed. Additional primary antibodies were anti-GAPDH (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GFP (1:1000, Abcam), anti-Ser(P)-778 dynamin I (1:1000, Abcam), and anti-dynamin I (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Additional secondary antibodies were HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-sheep IgG (1:5000, Abcam). Postnatal hippocampal cultures were generated as described previously (21Ryan T.A. Inhibitors of myosin light chain kinase block synaptic vesicle pool mobilization during action potential firing.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1317-1323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Neurons were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked with 5% BSA, and subsequently incubated with primary antibodies, purified rabbit anti-rat CNAγ (1 μg/ml) and mouse anti-vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1, 1:1000, Synaptic Systems), overnight at 4 °C. After washing to remove primary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse- or Alexa Fluor 546 anti-rabbit-conjugated secondary antibodies were applied (1:1000). Images were acquired using a ×63 (numerical aperture 1.34) objective lens on a Leica epifluorescence microscope with a CoolSNAP HQ charge-coupled device camera driven by Metamorph. To quantify presynaptic CNAγ distribution, vGlut1-positive puncta were selected as a presynaptic marker, and the intensities of both vGlut1 and CNAγ were quantified using ImageJ. Vibratome sections of 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde perfusion-fixed mouse hippocampi were immunostained using rabbit anti-mouse CNAγ antiserum overnight at room temperature. Sections were incubated with biotinylated horse anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (1:250, Vector) for 2 h and in Avidin biotin peroxidase (1:200, Vector) for 2 h at room temperature. Tissue-bound peroxidase was visualized with a diaminobenzidine (5 mg/ml, H2O2 0.03%) reaction. Slices were osmicated, dehydrated, and embedded in durcupan (FLUKA, ACM). Ultrathin sections (60 nm thick) were prepared on an Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Leica) and analyzed in a Tecnai 10 electron microscope. For post-embedding immuno-EM, sections were washed in phosphate buffer overnight and placed into sucrose solutions with increasing concentrations (0.5, 1, and 2 m sucrose for 0.5, 1, and 2 h, respectively). Sections were slammed onto copper blocks, cooled in liquid nitrogen, and, following low-temperature dehydration and freeze substitution, embedded in Lowicryl HM 20 resin (Chemische Werke Lowi). Post-embedding immunocytochemistry was performed on 60-nm serial sections on pioloform-coated nickel grids. Sections were incubated on drops of blocking solution for 1 h (20% BSA), followed by incubation on drops of anti-CNAγ antisera overnight at room temperature. The primary and secondary antibodies (15 nm gold-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, 1:20, Amersham Biosciences) were diluted in TBS plus 0.03% Triton X-100 and 2% human serum albumin (Sigma). Following washes in TBS, the sections were washed in water and contrasted with saturated aqueous uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Oligonucleotides of the rat Ppp3cc cDNA target sequence (CGGCTAACTTTGAAGGAAGTA, Invitrogen) were annealed and ligated into pSUPER. Constructs were transfected for 8 days, and experiments were performed 14–21 days after plating. To quantify the efficiency of the knockdown, immunocytochemistry was performed on neurons co-transfected with the Ppp3cc shRNA vector and vGlut1-pHluorin (22Balaji J. Ryan T.A. Single-vesicle imaging reveals that synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis are coupled by a single stochastic mode.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20576-20581Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) using GFP (Invitrogen) and CNAγ antibodies and Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated secondary antibodies. Cells were imaged using an epifluorescence microscope with an electron multiplying charge-coupled device camera. Fluorescence levels of CNAγ were measured and corrected for background in surrounding regions at cell bodies in transfected knockdown neurons and in non-transfected control neurons, as described previously for related proteins (23Kim S.H. Ryan T.A. CDK5 serves as a major control point in neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2010; 67: 797-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Transfected neurons were identified by vGlut1-pHluorin expression, which marks cell bodies when cells are fixed and permeabilized. For the shRNA-resistant construct, the rat Ppp3cc cDNA in the pExpress-1 expression vector was acquired (Open Biosystems). The shRNA target sequence was mutated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The sequence for the shRNA target sequence was changed to CGGCTTACGTTAAAAGAAGTA, leaving the amino acid sequence unchanged. For the inactive form of CNAγ, histidine 147 in the catalytic region of rat CNAγ was mutated to alanine as described previously (24Mondragon A. Griffith E.C. Sun L. Xiong F. Armstrong C. Liu J.O. Overexpression and purification of human calcineurin α from Escherichia coli and assessment of catalytic functions of residues surrounding the binuclear metal center.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4934-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). Rat CNAα and CNAβ in the pcDNA3 vector were utilized for rescue experiments in CNAγ shRNA-transfected neurons. Coverslips were mounted in a perfusion and stimulation chamber on a custom-built epifluorescence microscope. Cells were perfused at 75–250 μl/min with a solution containing 119 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 30 mm glucose plus 10 μm 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (Sigma) and 50 μm d,l-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (Sigma). Cells were imaged at 30 °C with a flexible resistive objective heater (Omega) utilizing an on/off controller (Minco). Cells were illuminated utilizing a 488-nm diode-pumped solid-state laser (Coherent), shuttered using an acousto-optic modulation. Fluorescence excitation and collection was through a ×40/1.3 numerical aperture Fluar Zeiss objective using 515- to 560-nm emission and 510-nm dichroic filters (Chroma) and a ×1.6 Optivar tube lens. Laser power at the back aperture was ∼1 milliwatt, imaging onto an iXon+ (Andor, DU-897E-BV) back-illuminated, electron-multiplying, charge-coupled device camera. Action potentials were evoked by passing 1-ms current pulses via platinum-iridium electrodes from an isolated current stimulator (World Precision Instruments). Fitting of endocytosis time constants with single exponential decays was done using OriginPro (OriginLab) with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with a temporal offset for reacidification of ∼5 s (22Balaji J. Ryan T.A. Single-vesicle imaging reveals that synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis are coupled by a single stochastic mode.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20576-20581Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The kinetics of synaptic vesicle reacidification were measured, with minor modifications, as described previously (25Atluri P.P. Ryan T.A. The kinetics of synaptic vesicle reacidification at hippocampal nerve terminals.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2313-2320Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Neurons transfected with vGlut1-pHluorin with or without CNAγ shRNA were stimulated at 50 Hz for 4 s. Surface vGlut1-pHluorin was acutely quenched by puffing MES-based Tyrode's buffer (pH 5.5), which permits the isolation of fluorescence from recently endocytosed synaptic vesicles. The decay of fluorescence was measured during this period, marking the reacidification of recently internalized vesicles. Data presented are mean ± S.E. Mann-Whitney U test or Student's t test was used for comparisons performed in GraphPad Prism 4.03, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. To examine the expression and localization of CNAγ relative to α and β, it was critical to develop antibodies specific to the individual isoforms. The C-terminal region of the proteins was chosen as the target for antibody generation because of its high level of amino acid sequence divergence (see “Experimental Procedures”). Custom rabbit polyclonal antibodies were developed against each isoform using peptides within this region as immunogens. The minimal sequence overlap between the corresponding peptides in the three calcineurin isoforms resulted in the absence of cross-reactivity of the antibodies (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis of mouse hippocampal protein extracts using these custom antisera demonstrated that CNAγ, as well as CNAα and CNAβ, are expressed in the brain (Fig. 1B). Tissue expression analysis demonstrated that, consistent with previous reports (3Jiang H. Xiong F. Kong S. Ogawa T. Kobayashi M. Liu J.O. Distinct tissue and cellular distribution of two major isoforms of calcineurin.Mol. Immunol. 1997; 34: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), CNAα and β proteins are enriched in the mouse brain. In addition, we found that, although CNAγ is expressed at the highest level in the testis, it is enriched in the brain relative to all other examined tissues (Fig. 1C). We confirmed the expression of CNAγ in the human neocortex by performing immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis using purified custom anti-CNAγ antibodies (Fig. 1D). A previous report on the basis of in situ hybridization analysis indicated that expression of Ppp3cc mRNA is regulated developmentally in specific rodent brain regions, with the highest expression during embryonic development, whereas expression of Ppp3ca and Ppp3cb peaks postnatally (26Eastwood S.L. Salih T. Harrison P.J. Differential expression of calcineurin A subunit mRNA isoforms during rat hippocampal and cerebellar development.Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 3017-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To determine whether a similar regulation is observed at the protein level, we examined the developmental expression of the CNAγ protein in the mouse neocortex. We found that the protein levels for all three CNA isoforms increased postnatally, reaching a peak around 2 weeks of age and remaining higher than embryonic levels well into adulthood (Fig. 1D). Despite being divergent from CNAα and β (2Rusnak F. Mertz P. Calcineurin: form and function.Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar), CNAγ forms a functional phosphatase (10Kilka S. Erdmann F. Migdoll A. Fischer G. Weiwad M. The proline-rich N-terminal sequence of calcineurin Aβ determines substrate binding.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 1900-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether it dephosphorylates calcineurin substrates involved in neuronal function. To address this question, we examined whether CNAγ can dephosphorylate the calcineurin substrate dynamin I, a protein critical for presynaptic function (27Ferguson S.M. De Camilli P. Dynamin, a membrane-remodelling GTPase.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). We first generated expression constructs for constitutively active forms of the human CNA isoforms lacking the autoinhibitory domain and for dynamin I. We used these constructs to co-express each isoform with dynamin I in 293T cells and analyzed the level of phosphorylation of the dynamin I residue Ser-778, a known calcineurin substrate (28Anggono V. Smillie K.J. Graham M.E. Valova V.A. Cousin M.A. Robinson P.J. Syndapin I is the phosphorylation-regulated dynamin I partner in synaptic vesicle endocytosis.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 752-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Expression of all three isoforms of CNA, including CNAγ, resulted in a decreased level of phosphorylation of dynamin I Ser-778 (Fig. 1E), indicating that CNAγ forms a functional phosphatase capable of modifying known synaptic calcineurin substrates. Calcineurin is known to modulate neuronal processes occurring in multiple subcellular compartments (1Groth R.D. Dunbar R.L. Mermelstein P.G. Calcineurin regulation of neuronal plasticity.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 1159-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To investigate the neuronal functional role of CNAγ, we first analyzed whether it is localized to a specific neuronal subcellular compartment. Fluorescence immunocytochemistry analysis of CNAγ performed on cultured rat hippocampal neurons revealed a punctate staining pattern colocalized with vGlut1, a marker of excitatory presynaptic terminals (Fig. 2A). Densitometry measurements performed for CNAγ and vGlut1 on 504 vGlut1 puncta showed that most excitatory synapses within hippocampal cultures contain measurable levels of CNAγ and that the level of CNAγ signal correlates with vGlut1 levels (Fig. 2B, R2 = 0.38, p < 0.0001). These data indicate that CNAγ is localized to synaptic contacts. We next performed immuno-EM analysis to further resolve the subcellular localization of CNAγ. Pre-embedding immuno-EM labeling for CNAα and CNAβ in the mouse hippocampus showed a postsynaptic enrichment (Fig. 3, A and B), consistent with previous reports on the localization of calcineurin (29Halpain S. Hipolito A. Saffer L. Regulation of F-actin stability in dendritic spines by glutamate receptors and calcineurin.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9835-9844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Sík A. Hájos N. Gulácsi A. Mody I. Freund T.F. The absence of a major Ca2+ signaling pathway in GABAergic neurons of the hippocampus.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 3245-3250Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In contrast, CNAγ labeling was observed most prominently in the vicinity of synaptic vesicle clusters (Fig. 3, C–E). This subcellular localization of CNAγ was supported using post-embedding immunogold labeling in mouse hippocampal sections (Fig. 3, F–H). These results indicate that CNAγ is present in presynaptic terminals. The localization of CNAγ to presynaptic terminals suggests that it may have a role in modulating presynaptic function. Therefore, we examined the effects of shRNA-mediated CNAγ knockdown on synaptic vesicle cycling in primary neurons using the vGlut1-pHluorin system (22Balaji J. Ryan T.A. Single-vesicle imaging reveals that synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis are coupled by a single stochastic mode.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 20576-20581Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Rat hippocampal neurons were co-transfected with a Ppp3cc-specific shRNA and the vGlut1-pHluorin construct, and immunocytochemistry analysis for CNAγ was performed to confirm knockdown of the CNAγ protein (Fig. 4, A and B; Mann-Whitney U test, U = 2289, p < 0.0001). We next analyzed the effects of CNAγ knockdown on synaptic vesicle release and recycling. First, we measured vGlut1-pHluorin responses to a 10-Hz, 100-action potential stimulation from individual neurons transfected with Ppp3cc shRNA plus vGlut1-pHluorin or vGlut1-pHluorin alone. The fluorescence signals induced by the stimulation at each bouton were normalized to those obtained by rapid alkalization of the entire labeled vesicle pool using NH4Cl (23Kim S.H. Ryan T.A. CDK5 serves as a major control point in neurotransmitter release.Neuron. 2010; 67: 797-809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). These experiments showed that reduction of CNAγ expression led to a modest reduction in vesicle exocytosis, but this difference did not achieve statistical significance (Fig. 4, C and D; Student's t test, t(25) = 1.25, p = 0.24). In contrast, when we examined the kinetics of vesicle endocytosis by fitting the fluorescence recovery with a single exponential curve (Fig. 4, C and E), we found that there was a significant slowing of the time constant of fluorescence recovery (Fig. 3E; Student's t test, t(26) = 3.91, p < 0.001). Critically, restoration of the expression of CNAγ by co-transfection with a shRNA-resistant expression vector resulted in a restoration of synaptic vesicle endocytosis (Fig. 4E; Student's t test, t(18) = 0.43, p = 0.7 relative to the control). These data indicate that CNAγ modulates synaptic vesicle recovery. The recovery kinetics result from a combination of two processes: vesicle endocytosis and vesicle re"

We excluded patients diagnosed with psychoses, without a known GP, those not able to complete a questionnaire, and patients admitted to psychiatric in-patient care or other institutions where their GP could not follow them immediately after discharge.The GPs received a written guideline, contacted the patients and scheduled a consultation within one week after discharge, and then provided regular consultations for six months. We randomised the patients to either intervention (n = 78) or treatment as usual (n = 98).Primary outcome measure was the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI). Secondary outcomes were Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), self-reported further self-harm and treatment for DSP in a general hospital or an emergency medical agency (EMA). We assessed patients on entry to the trial and at three and six months. We collected data from interviews, self-report questionnaires, and hospital and EMA medical records.There were no significant differences between the groups in SSI, BDI, or BHS mean scores or change from baseline to three or six months. During follow-up, self-reported DSP was 39.5% in the intervention group vs. 15.8% in controls (P = 0.009). Readmissions to general hospitals were similar (13% in both groups (P = 0.963), while DSP episodes treated at EMAs were 17% in the intervention group and 7% in the control group (P = 0.103).Structured follow-up by GPs after an episode of DSP had no significant effect on suicide ideation, depression or hopelessness. There was no significant difference in repeated episodes of DSP in hospitals or EMAs. However, the total number of incidents of deliberate self-harm reported by the patients was significantly higher in the intervention group.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01342809."
https://openalex.org/W2295441273,"Individual joint deviations are often identified in the analysis of cerebral palsy (CP) gait. However, knowledge is limited as to how these deviations affect the control of the locomotor system as a whole when striving to meet the demands of walking. The current study aimed to bridge the gap by describing the control of the locomotor system in children with diplegic CP in terms of their leg stiffness, both skeletal and muscular components, and associated joint stiffness during gait. Twelve children with spastic diplegia CP and 12 healthy controls walked at a self-selected pace in a gait laboratory while their kinematic and forceplate data were measured and analyzed during loading response, mid-stance, terminal stance and pre-swing. For calculating the leg stiffness, each of the lower limbs was modeled as a non-linear spring, connecting the hip joint center and the corresponding center of pressure, with varying stiffness that was calculated as the slope (gradient) of the axial force vs. the deformation curve. The leg stiffness was further decomposed into skeletal and muscular components considering the alignment of the lower limb. The ankle, knee and hip of the limb were modeled as revolute joints with torsional springs whose stiffness was calculated as the slope of the moment vs. the angle curve of the joint. Independent t-tests were performed for between-group comparisons of all the variables. The CP group significantly decreased the leg stiffness but increased the joint stiffness during stance phase, except during terminal stance where the leg stiffness was increased. They appeared to rely more on muscular contributions to achieve the required leg stiffness, increasing the muscular demands in maintaining the body posture against collapse. Leg stiffness plays a critical role in modulating the kinematics and kinetics of the locomotor system during gait in the diplegic CP."
https://openalex.org/W2186800652,"Carnivorous plants primarily use aspartic proteases during digestion of captured prey. In contrast, the major endopeptidases in the digestive fluid of the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) are cysteine proteases (dionain-1 to -4). Here, we present the crystal structure of mature dionain-1 in covalent complex with inhibitor E-64 at 1.5 Å resolution. The enzyme exhibits an overall protein fold reminiscent of other plant cysteine proteases. The inactive glycosylated pro-form undergoes autoprocessing and self-activation, optimally at the physiologically relevant pH value of 3.6, at which the protective effect of the pro-domain is lost. The mature enzyme was able to efficiently degrade a Drosophila fly protein extract at pH 4 showing high activity against the abundant Lys- and Arg-rich protein, myosin. The substrate specificity of dionain-1 was largely similar to that of papain with a preference for hydrophobic and aliphatic residues in subsite S2 and for positively charged residues in S1. A tentative structure of the pro-domain was obtained by homology modeling and suggested that a pro-peptide Lys residue intrudes into the S2 pocket, which is more spacious than in papain. This study provides the first analysis of a cysteine protease from the digestive fluid of a carnivorous plant and confirms the close relationship between carnivorous action and plant defense mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W2258857075,"In this study, we present data indicating a robust and specific domain interaction between the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) first cytosolic loop (CL1) and nucleotide binding domain 1 (NBD1) that allows ion transport to proceed in a regulated fashion. We used co-precipitation and ELISA to establish the molecular contact and showed that binding kinetics were not altered by the common clinical mutation F508del. Both intrinsic ATPase activity and CFTR channel gating were inhibited severely by CL1 peptide, suggesting that NBD1/CL1 binding is a crucial requirement for ATP hydrolysis and channel function. In addition to cystic fibrosis, CFTR dysregulation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of prevalent diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acquired rhinosinusitis, pancreatitis, and lethal secretory diarrhea (e.g. cholera). On the basis of clinical relevance of the CFTR as a therapeutic target, a cell-free drug screen was established to identify modulators of NBD1/CL1 channel activity independent of F508del CFTR and pharmacologic rescue. Our findings support a targetable mechanism of CFTR regulation in which conformational changes in the NBDs cause reorientation of transmembrane domains via interactions with CL1 and result in channel gating."
https://openalex.org/W2261850458,"Hyaluronan (HA) is synthesized by three HA synthases (HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3) and secreted in the extracellular matrix. In human skin, large amounts of HA are found in the dermis. HA is also synthesized by keratinocytes in the epidermis, although its epidermal functions are not clearly identified yet. To investigate HA functions, we studied the effects of HA depletion on human keratinocyte physiology within in vitro reconstructed human epidermis. Inhibition of HA synthesis with 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) did not modify the expression profile of the epidermal differentiation markers involucrin, keratin 10, and filaggrin during tissue reconstruction. In contrast, when keratinocytes were incubated with 4MU, cell proliferation was decreased. In an attempt to rescue the proliferation function, HA samples of various mean molecular masses were added to keratinocyte cultures treated with 4MU. These samples were unable to rescue the initial proliferation rate. Furthermore, treatments with HA-specific hyaluronidase, although removing almost all HA from keratinocyte cultures, did not alter the differentiation or proliferation processes. The differences between 4MU and hyaluronidase effects did not result from differences in intracellular HA, sulfated glycosaminoglycan concentration, apoptosis, or levels of HA receptors, all of which remained unchanged. Similarly, knockdown of UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase (UGDH) using lentiviral shRNA effectively decreased HA production but did not affect proliferation rate. Overall, these data suggest that HA levels in the human epidermis are not directly correlated with keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation and that incubation of cells with 4MU cannot equate with HA removal.

Importantly, endothelial dysfunction is a common feature of cerebral blood vessels in AD. In this study, we sought to determine if regional heterogeneity of cerebral microvessels might help explain the susceptibility of the hippocampus and cortex as compared to the cerebellum. We isolated microvessels from wild type mice from the cerebellum, cortex, and hippocampus to characterize their vascular phenotype. Superoxide anion was significantly higher in microvessels isolated from the cortex and hippocampus as compared to the cerebellum. Importantly, protein levels of NADPH oxidase (NOX)-2 and NOX-4 were significantly higher in the cortical and hippocampal microvessels as compared to microvessels from the cerebellum. In addition, expression of manganese superoxide dismutase protein was significantly lower in microvessels from the cortex and hippocampus as compared to cerebellum while other antioxidant enzymes were unchanged. There was no difference in eNOS protein expression between the microvessels of the three brain regions; however, bioavailability of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an essential cofactor for eNOS activity, was significantly reduced in microvessels from the hippocampus and cortex as compared to the cerebellum. Higher levels of superoxide and reduced tetrahydrobiopterin bioavailability may help explain the vulnerability of the hippocampus and cortical microvessels to oxidative stress and development of endothelial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2188168399,"Unlike resting CD4+ T cells, activated CD4+T cells are highly susceptible to infection of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1). HIV-1 infects T cells and macrophages without activating the nucleic acid sensors and the anti-viral type I interferon response. Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is an RNA editing enzyme that displays antiviral activity against several RNA viruses. Mutations in ADAR1 cause the autoimmune disorder Aicardi-Goutieères syndrome (AGS). This disease is characterized by an inappropriate activation of the interferon-stimulated gene response. Here we show that HIV-1 replication, in ADAR1-deficient CD4+T lymphocytes from AGS patients, is blocked at the level of protein translation. Furthermore, viral protein synthesis block is accompanied by an activation of interferon-stimulated genes. RNA silencing of ADAR1 in Jurkat cells also inhibited HIV-1 protein synthesis. Our data support that HIV-1 requires ADAR1 for efficient replication in human CD4+T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2190222425,"Eukaryotic 20S proteasome assembly remains poorly understood. The subunits stack into four heteroheptameric rings; three inner-ring subunits (β1, β2, and β5) bear the protease catalytic residues and are synthesized with N-terminal propeptides. These propeptides are removed autocatalytically late in assembly. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, β5 (Doa3/Pre2) has a 75-residue propeptide, β5pro, that is essential for proteasome assembly and can work in trans. We show that deletion of the poorly conserved N-terminal half of the β5 propeptide nonetheless causes substantial defects in proteasome maturation. Sequences closer to the cleavage site have critical but redundant roles in both assembly and self-cleavage. A conserved histidine two residues upstream of the autocleavage site strongly promotes processing. Surprisingly, although β5pro is functionally linked to the Ump1 assembly factor, trans-expressed β5pro associates only weakly with Ump1-containing precursors. Several genes were identified as dosage suppressors of trans-expressed β5pro mutants; the strongest encoded the β7 proteasome subunit. Previous data suggested that β7 and β5pro have overlapping roles in bringing together two half-proteasomes, but the timing of β7 addition relative to half-mer joining was unclear. Here we report conditions where dimerization lags behind β7 incorporation into the half-mer. Our results suggest that β7 insertion precedes half-mer dimerization, and the β7 tail and β5 propeptide have unequal roles in half-mer joining."
https://openalex.org/W2185672106,"Krill (Euphausiids) play a vital ecosystem role in many of the world's most productive marine regions, providing an important trophic linkage. We introduce a robust modeling approach to link Cassin's auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus) abundance and distribution to large-scale and local oceanic and atmospheric conditions and relate these patterns to similarly modeled distributions of an important prey resource, krill. We carried out at-sea strip transect bird surveys and hydroacoustic assessments of euphausiids (2004-2013). Data informed separate, spatially-explicit predictive models of Cassin's auklet abundance (zero-inflated negative binomial regression) and krill biomass (two-part model) based on these surveys. We established the type of prey responsible for acoustic backscatter by conducting net tows of the upper 50 m during surveys. We determined the types of prey fed to Cassin's auklet chicks by collecting diet samples from provisioning adults. Using time-depth-recorders, we found Cassin's auklets utilized consistent areas in the upper water column, less than 30 m, where krill could be found (99.5% of dives were less than 30 m). Birds primarily preyed upon two species of euphausiids, Euphausia pacifica and Thysanoessa spinifera, which were available in the upper water column. Cassin's auklet abundance was best predicted by both large scale and localized oceanic processes (upwelling) while krill biomass was best predicted by local factors (temperature, salinity, and fluorescence) and both large scale and localized oceanic processes (upwelling). Models predicted varying krill and bird distribution by month and year. Our work informs the use of Cassin's auklet as a valuable indicator or krill abundance and distribution and strengthens our understanding of the link between Cassin's auklet and its primary prey. We expect future increases in frequency and magnitude of anomalous ocean conditions will result in decreased availability of krill leading to declines in the Farallon Islands population of Cassin's auklets."

In this study, Lactobacillus plantarum strains NC8 and WCFS1 were used as oral delivery vehicles containing a pSIP411-VP1 recombinant plasmid to initiate mucosal and systemic immune responses in guinea pigs. Guinea pigs were orally vaccinated (three doses) with NC8-pSIP411, NC8-pSIP411-VP1, WCFS1-pSIP411, WCFS1-pSIP411-VP1 or milk. Animals immunized with NC8-pSIP411-VP1 and WCFS1-pSIP411-VP1 developed high levels of antigen-specific serum IgG, IgA, IgM, mucosal secretory IgA (sIgA) and neutralizing antibodies, and revealed stronger cell-mediated immune responses and enhanced protection against FMDV challenge compared with control groups. The recombinant pSIP411-VP1 effectively improved immunoprotection against FMDV in guinea pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2264052247,"A broadcast encryption scheme with personalized messages (BEPM) is a scheme in which a broadcaster transmits not only encrypted broadcast messages to a subset of recipients but also encrypted personalized messages to each user individually. Several broadcast encryption (BE) schemes allow a broadcaster encrypts a message for a subset S of recipients with public keys and any user in S can decrypt the message with his/her private key. However, these BE schemes can not provide an efficient way to transmit encrypted personalized messages to each user individually. In this paper, we propose a broadcast encryption scheme with a transmission of personalized messages. Besides, the scheme is based on multilinear maps ensure constant ciphertext size and private key size of each user and the scheme can achieve statically security. More realistically, the scheme can be applied to the Conditional Access System (CAS) of pay television (pay-TV) efficiently and safely."
https://openalex.org/W2255553757,"Sports trauma are able to induce muscle injury with fibrosis and accumulation of intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT), which affect muscle function. This study was designed to investigate whether hypoactivity would influence IMAT accumulation in regenerating mouse skeletal muscle using the glycerol model of muscle regeneration. The animals were immediately hindlimb unloaded for 21 days after glycerol injection into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle. Muscle fiber and adipocyte cross-sectional area (CSA) and IMAT accumulation were determined by histomorphometric analysis. Adipogenesis during regenerative processes was examined using RT-qPCR and Western blot quantification. Twenty-one days of hindlimb unloading resulted in decreases of 38% and 50.6% in the muscle weight/body weight ratio and CSA, respectively, in soleus muscle. Glycerol injection into TA induced IMAT accumulation, reaching 3% of control normal-loading muscle area. This IMAT accumulation was largely inhibited in unloading conditions (0.09%) and concomitant with a marked reduction in perilipin and FABP4 protein content, two key markers of mature adipocytes. Induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα mRNA, two markers of adipogenesis, was also decreased. Furthermore, the protein expression of PDGFRα, a cell surface marker of fibro/adipogenic progenitors, was much lower in regenerating TA from the unloaded group. Exposure of regenerating muscle to hypoactivity severely reduces IMAT development and accumulation. These results provide new insight into the mechanisms regulating IMAT development in skeletal muscle and highlight the importance of taking into account the level of mechanical constraint imposed on skeletal muscle during the regeneration processes."
https://openalex.org/W2264340267,"Epiregulin (EPR) is a ligand of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family that upon binding to its epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) stimulates proliferative signaling, especially in colon cancer cells. Here, we describe the three-dimensional structure of the EPR antibody (the 9E5(Fab) fragment) in the presence and absence of EPR. Among the six complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), CDR1-3 in the light chain and CDR2 in the heavy chain predominantly recognize EPR. In particular, CDR3 in the heavy chain dramatically moves with cis-trans isomerization of Pro(103). A molecular dynamics simulation and mutational analyses revealed that Arg(40) in EPR is a key residue for the specific binding of 9E5 IgG. From isothermal titration calorimetry analysis, the dissociation constant was determined to be 6.5 nm. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that the dissociation rate of 9E5 IgG is extremely slow. The superimposed structure of 9E5(Fab)·EPR on the known complex structure of EGF·EGFR showed that the 9E5(Fab) paratope overlaps with Domains I and III on the EGFR, which reveals that the 9E5(Fab)·EPR complex could not bind to the EGFR. The 9E5 antibody will also be useful in medicine as a neutralizing antibody specific for colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2261334695,"Mumps viruses show diverse cytopathic effects (CPEs) of infected cells and viral plaque formation (no CPE or no plaque formation in some cases) depending on the viral strain, highlighting the difficulty in mumps laboratory studies. In our previous study, a new sialidase substrate, 2-(benzothiazol-2-yl)-4-bromophenyl 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-α-D-glycero-D-galacto-2-nonulopyranosidonic acid (BTP3-Neu5Ac), was developed for visualization of sialidase activity. BTP3-Neu5Ac can easily and rapidly perform histochemical fluorescent visualization of influenza viruses and virus-infected cells without an antiviral antibody and cell fixation. In the present study, the potential utility of BTP3-Neu5Ac for rapid detection of mumps virus was demonstrated. BTP3-Neu5Ac could visualize dot-blotted mumps virus, virus-infected cells, and plaques (plaques should be called focuses due to staining of infected cells in this study), even if a CPE was not observed. Furthermore, virus cultivation was possible by direct pick-up from a fluorescent focus. In conventional methods, visible appearance of the CPE and focuses often requires more than 6 days after infection, but the new method with BTP3-Neu5Ac clearly visualized infected cells after 2 days and focuses after 4 days. The BTP3-Neu5Ac assay is a precise, easy, and rapid assay for confirmation and titration of mumps virus."
https://openalex.org/W2182655205,"Background Automatic detection of the 1st (S1) and 2nd (S2) heart sounds is difficult, and existing algorithms are imprecise. We sought to develop a wavelet-based algorithm for the detection of S1 and S2 in children with and without pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Method Heart sounds were recorded at the second left intercostal space and the cardiac apex with a digital stethoscope simultaneously with pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP). We developed a Daubechies wavelet algorithm for the automatic detection of S1 and S2 using the wavelet coefficient ‘D6’ based on power spectral analysis. We compared our algorithm with four other Daubechies wavelet-based algorithms published by Liang, Kumar, Wang, and Zhong. We annotated S1 and S2 from an audiovisual examination of the phonocardiographic tracing by two trained cardiologists and the observation that in all subjects systole was shorter than diastole. Results We studied 22 subjects (9 males and 13 females, median age 6 years, range 0.25–19). Eleven subjects had a mean PAP < 25 mmHg. Eleven subjects had PAH with a mean PAP ≥ 25 mmHg. All subjects had a pulmonary artery wedge pressure ≤ 15 mmHg. The sensitivity (SE) and positive predictivity (+P) of our algorithm were 70% and 68%, respectively. In comparison, the SE and +P of Liang were 59% and 42%, Kumar 19% and 12%, Wang 50% and 45%, and Zhong 43% and 53%, respectively. Our algorithm demonstrated robustness and outperformed the other methods up to a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 10 dB. For all algorithms, detection errors arose from low-amplitude peaks, fast heart rates, low signal-to-noise ratio, and fixed thresholds. Conclusion Our algorithm for the detection of S1 and S2 improves the performance of existing Daubechies-based algorithms and justifies the use of the wavelet coefficient ‘D6’ through power spectral analysis. Also, the robustness despite ambient noise may improve real world clinical performance."
https://openalex.org/W2185213501,"Introduction Sea turtles face threats globally and are protected by national and international laws. Allometry and scaling models greatly aid sea turtle conservation and research, and help to better understand the biology of sea turtles. Scaling, however, may differ between regions and/or life stages. We analyze differences between (i) two different regional subsets and (ii) three different life stage subsets of the western North Atlantic loggerhead turtles by comparing the relative growth of body width and depth in relation to body length, and discuss the implications. Results and Discussion Results suggest that the differences between scaling relationships of different regional subsets are negligible, and models fitted on data from one region of the western North Atlantic can safely be used on data for the same life stage from another North Atlantic region. On the other hand, using models fitted on data for one life stage to describe other life stages is not recommended if accuracy is of paramount importance. In particular, young loggerhead turtles that have not recruited to neritic habitats should be studied and modeled separately whenever practical, while neritic juveniles and adults can be modeled together as one group. Even though morphometric scaling varies among life stages, a common model for all life stages can be used as a general description of scaling, and assuming isometric growth as a simplification is justified. In addition to linear models traditionally used for scaling on log-log axes, we test the performance of a saturating (curvilinear) model. The saturating model is statistically preferred in some cases, but the accuracy gained by the saturating model is marginal."
https://openalex.org/W2187245592,"A growing body of evidence has found that mortality rates are positively correlated with social inequalities, air pollution, elevated ambient temperature, availability of medical care and other factors. This study develops a model to predict the mortality rates for different diseases by county across the US. The model is applied to predict changes in mortality caused by changing environmental factors. A total of 3,110 counties in the US, excluding Alaska and Hawaii, were studied. A subset of 519 counties from the 3,110 counties was chosen by using systematic random sampling and these samples were used to validate the model. Step-wise and linear regression analyses were used to estimate the ability of environmental pollutants, socio-economic factors and other factors to explain variations in county-specific mortality rates for cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), all causes combined and lifespan across five population density groups. The estimated models fit adequately for all mortality outcomes for all population density groups and, adequately predicted risks for the 519 validation counties. This study suggests that, at local county levels, average ozone (0.07 ppm) is the most important environmental predictor of mortality. The analysis also illustrates the complex inter-relationships of multiple factors that influence mortality and lifespan, and suggests the need for a better understanding of the pathways through which these factors, mortality, and lifespan are related at the community level."
https://openalex.org/W2257617546,"This study aims at demonstrating the immunomodulatory property of jacaric acid, a conjugated linolenic acid (CLNA) isomer that is present in jacaranda seed oil, on murine peritoneal macrophages. Our results showed that jacaric acid exhibited no significant cytotoxicity on the thioglycollate-elicited murine peritoneal macrophages as revealed by the neutral red uptake assay, but markedly increased their cytostatic activity on the T-cell lymphoma MBL-2 cells as measured by the fluorometric CyQuant® NF Cell Proliferation Assay Kit. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that jacaric acid could enhance the endocytic activity of macrophages and elevated their intracellular production of superoxide anion. Moreover, jacaric acid-treated macrophages showed an increase in the production of nitric oxide which was accompanied by an increase in the expression level of inducible nitric oxide synthase protein. In addition, the secretion of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interferon-γ, interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, was up-regulated. Collectively, our results indicated that the naturally-occurring CLNA isomer, jacaric acid, could exhibit immunomodulating activity on the murine peritoneal macrophages in vitro, suggesting that this CLNA isomer may act as an immunopotentiator which can be exploited for the treatment of some immunological disorders with minimal toxicity and fewer side effects."
