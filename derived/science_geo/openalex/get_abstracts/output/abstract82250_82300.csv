https://openalex.org/W2028180466,"The distribution of T cells and T cell subsets was examined within the human central nervous system in active lesions from seven patients with chronic multiple sclerosis. The monoclonal antibodies anti-T11, anti-T4, and anti-T8 were used to detect total (whole) T cells, helper T cells, and suppressor-cytotoxic T cells, respectively, and a monoclonal antibody against human Ia was used for macrophages and B cells. Lesion progression was associated with large numbers of T4+ cells at the lesion margin and these extended great distances into the adjacent normal-appearing white matter. T8+ cells were most commonly concentrated around the lesion margin and displayed a preferential perivascular distribution. Within the lesion center, only a few T cells were found. Ia+ macrophages were most numerous within the centers of active lesions and were always present in the adjacent normal white matter. The monoclonal antibodies to T cells did not cross-react with glial cells including oligodendrocytes. These results indicate that T4+ cells are actively involved in lesion extension and Ia+ cells, in demyelination."
https://openalex.org/W1638222837,"In human platelets stimulated by thrombin and collagen, diacylglycerol is rapidly produced from phosphatidylinositol. Concurrently, an endogenous protein having a molecular weight of about 40,000 (40K protein) is phosphorylated, and serotonin is released. These reactions are all inhibited by a prior treatment of platelets with prostaglandin E1, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, sodium nitroprusside, or with 8-bromo-cyclic GMP, which are known as potent inhibitors for platelet activation. Ca2+-activated phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) preferentially phosphorylates 40K protein. As judged by fingerprint analysis, the sites in 40K protein that are phosphorylated during the platelet activation appear to be identical with those phosphorylated by protein kinase C in a purified cell-free system. 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, which directly activates protein kinase C by substituting for diacylglycerol, stimulates 40K protein phosphorylation and release reaction without inducing diacylglycerol formation. Tetracaine, which inhibits protein kinase C by competing with phospholipid, blocks 40K protein phosphorylation and serotonin release without inhibiting the receptor-linked diacylglycerol formation. The results indicate that thrombin and collagen activate platelets in almost similar mechanisms and that protein kinase C may lie on a common pathway which leads to the release of serotonin. However, analysis with indomethacin indicates that the role of thromboxane A2 appears to be more predominant for the action of collagen, and it is suggestive that this arachidonate metabolite activates platelets in an analogous mechanism to thrombin."

https://openalex.org/W2091437986,"It has been suggested that the λ repressor stimulates transcription of its own gene by binding to the λ operator and contacting RNA polymerase bound to the adjacent promoter. We describe three different mutants (called pc) of the λ phage repressor that are specifically deficient in the positive control function. We show that the amino acid residues altered in the pc mutants lie on the surface of the DNA-bound repressor that we predict, based on structural and other evidence, would most closely approach DNA-bound polymerase. Furthermore, we describe a pc mutant of the P22 repressor. We argue that in both the λ and P22 repressors a structure comprised of two alpha helices has two functions: to bind DNA and to contact RNA polymerase. In the two cases, however, different regions of this structure contact polymerase to mediate positive control."
https://openalex.org/W2011715107,"Induction of prophage lambda inhibits the expression of the gal operon from its cognate promoters. The effect is observed only in cis, and is due to frequent transcription of the gal promoter region by RNA polymerase molecules initiating upstream at the prophage PL promoter. The frequency of transcription initiation at PL is some 30 times greater than that at the gal promoter, Pg1. PL is one of the strongest procaryotic promoters. This ""promoter occlusion"" is essentially complete when the distance between gal and PL is small (less than or equal to 10 kb); and when PL is fully active (that is, in the absence of the cl or cro repressors). We discuss the possibility that promoter occlusion at two lambda promoters, Pint and PR', might play a role in the sequential expression of viral functions."

Such immunotoxins are highly effective in killing murine leukemic cells in infiltrated bone marrow and should be useful in the bone marrow rescue approach for the treatment of cancer. Similar immunotoxins injected parentally can help to induce prolonged remissions in leukemic mice, and antigen-containing immunotoxins can induce immunologic unresponsiveness in vitro in normal murine splenocytes. Thus, long-range goals for the parental use of immunotoxins include the killing of cancer cells in vivo and the modulation of the immune response for therapeutic purposes."

Both activities were measured in the presence of 5 micrograms of oligomycin/mg of protein which completely inhibited these reactions catalyzed by submitochondrial particles. Analyses performed during the purification procedure demonstrated that the oligomycin-resistant pump was concentrated and highly purified in the fractions containing coated vesicles. Moreover, vesicles precipitated by either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies against clathrin contained the H+ pump activity. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (0.5 mM) and N-ethylmaleimide (1 mM) added to the assay mixture inhibited the pump completely, whereas neither vanadate, sodium azide, efrapeptin, or mitochondrial ATPase inhibitor had an effect."

https://openalex.org/W2155635337,"The cII protein of bacteriophage lambda has a decisive role in the regulatory switch between the lysogenic and lytic pathways of viral development. Recent work has indicated that cII may be the primary control function providing for the initial partition between the two pathways, with other host and viral regulatory genes acting to determine the levels of cII in an infected cell. We have studied the synthesis and stability of cII protein with two experimental systems, phage infection and a cII-producing plasmid. We have found that the stability of cII is controlled by the host hflA and viral cIII genes; hflA protein facilitates degradation of cII, whereas cIII protects cII. The synthesis of cII appears to be under the positive control of the host himA and himD genes. We conclude that posttranscriptional regulation of cII by host and viral genes is critical for the choice of a developmental pathway."

https://openalex.org/W1518609368,"Mouse mammary epithelial (NMuMG) cells produce both cellular and extracellular heparan sulfate-rich proteoglycans. A cellular proteoglycan, but no extracellular proteoglycans, associates quantitatively and vectorially with lipid vesicles, as assessed by column chromatography and centrifugation. This lipophilic cellular proteoglycan is extracted as an aggregate when cells are treated with 4 M guanidine HCl, but is extracted as a single component in the presence of detergent, suggesting that it aggregates with cellular lipid. An association with lipid is confirmed by intercalation of the proteoglycan into the bilayer of lipid vesicles. Formation of lipid vesicles in the presence of the proteoglycan causes the proteoglycan to have the chromatographic and sedimentation behavior of the vesicles while destruction of the vesicles with detergent nullifies this effect. The proteoglycan is intercalated nullifies this effect. The proteoglycan is intercalated into the vesicles with its glycosaminoglycan-containing domain exposed to the exterior since mild trypsin treatment quantitatively removes this portion of the proteoglycan from the vesicle. After cleavage from the vesicle, the released proteoglycan chromatographs with an apparent molecular size similar to that of the whole proteoglycan, but no longer aggregates with lipid. Thus, trypsin removes a lipophilic domain which is responsible for its interaction with lipid and presumably anchors the proteoglycan in cellular membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1532142157,"The interaction between the inhibitor protein and the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase has been investigated by steady state kinetics and by an assessment of the requirement of this interaction for ATP. By analysis for tightly bound inhibitors, inhibition by the inhibitor protein was shown to be competitive versus peptide substrate and uncompetitive versus Mg X ATP2-. This, together with the observations of Gronot et al. (Gronot, J., Mildvan, A.S., Bramson, H. N., Thomas, N., and Kaiser, E.T. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 602-610) and those given in the accompanying paper (Whitehouse, S., Feramisco, J.R., Casnellie, J.E., Krebs, E.G., and Walsh, D.A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 3693-3701), would indicate that the probable reaction mechanism of the protein kinase is ordered with the nucleotide binding first and that the inhibitor protein blocks catalysis by interaction with the catalytic subunit-Mg X ATP complex. The Ki for this interaction at saturating Mg X ATP and zero peptide substrate is 0.49 nM. Multiple inhibition analysis in the presence of 5'-adenylimidodiphosphate (AMP X PNP) indicates that the inhibitor protein does not interact with a catalytic subunit-AMP X PNP complex. The requirement for ATP for the inhibitor protein-catalytic subunit interaction has also been demonstrated by direct binding measurements and by the observation that the efficiency of the inhibitor protein is increased by preincubation of the inhibitor protein, catalytic subunit, and ATP in the absence of peptide substrate. By either measurement, the catalytic subunit in the presence of the inhibitor protein, was shown to exhibit an apparent Kd of 20 approximately 60 nM for ATP; this value is two orders of magnitude higher than the affinity for ATP by the catalytic subunit alone. This high apparent affinity of the catalytic subunit for ATP (in the presence of the inhibitor) does not require that there be a specific binding site on the inhibitor protein for some moiety of the ATP but may simply be a reflection of the formation of a catalytic subunit-Mg X ATP X inhibitor protein complex with resultant displacement of the equilibrium of ATP binding to the protein kinase."

https://openalex.org/W1996853815,"The N gene product of coliphage lambda acts with host factors (Nus) through sites (nut) to render subsequent downstream transcription resistant to a variety of termination signals. These sites, nutR and nutL, are downstream, respectively, from the early promoters PR and PL. Thus a complicated set of molecular interactions are likely to occur at the nut sites. We have selected mutations in the nutR region that reduce the effectiveness of pN in altering transcription initiating at the PR promoter. DNA sequence analysis of three independently selected mutations revealed, in each case, a deletion of a single base pair in the cro gene. Consideration of the effect of such mutations on the extension of translation of cro message into the adjacent downstream nut region led to the identification of a consensus sequence CGCTCT(T)TAA that appears to play a role in the recognition of a host factor, possibly the NusA protein."
https://openalex.org/W2123428556,"Using indirect immunofluorescence, we studied the reaction of antibodies specific for left-handed Z DNA with the nuclei of the hypotrichous ciliate Stylonychia mytilus. In the vegetative cell, the macronucleus reacts strongly with these antibodies, but no reaction can be detected with micronuclei. However, an antibody that binds to denatured and right-handed B DNA reacts with both types of nuclei. No reaction of the anti-Z DNA antibody is seen in the macronuclear replication band. Digestion of macronuclei with DNAase I leads to a decrease in the anti-Z DNA antibody reaction. Some stages of the developing macronucleus were also investigated. No reaction is seen at the polytene chromosome stage, but following DNA elimination the nucleus is seen to react with the antibody."
https://openalex.org/W1528377984,"The ADP-ribosylation of nonhistone, high mobility group (HMG) proteins in intact cultured cells was investigated. Radioactively labeled adenosine was used as a precursor to detect (ADP-ribose)n on protein. A protein fraction enriched in HMG proteins and histone H1 was separated from RNA and DNA by CsCl density gradient centrifugation, 5% perchloric acid extraction, and CM-Sephadex C-50 column chromatography. Poly- and mono(ADP-ribose) were recovered following alkaline hydrolysis, and 5'-AMP and (2'-(5-phosphoribosyl)-5'-AMP) were produced by phosphodiesterase treatment, indicating that the protein-bound radioactive material was (ADP-ribose)n. An average chain length of 1.5 to 1.8 was determined. Analysis of proteins by sodium dodecyl sulfate and acetic acid/urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that HMG 1, 2, 14, and 17 as well as histone H1 contained (ADP-ribose)n. Treatment of cells with 3-aminobenzamide, an inhibitor of (ADP-ribose)n synthetase, decreased endogenous ADP-ribosylation in both types of chromosomal proteins but that of HMG 14 and 17 was affected more."
https://openalex.org/W2086407097,"We show that displaced single-stranded overhangs are transiently generated and destroyed during nick translation by E. coli DNA polymerase I. Evidence that hyper- rec mutants have an increased frequency of such overhang structures is discussed. The transient generation of overhangs may be significant for general recombination. The 5′ → 3′ exonuclease activity of polymerase I specifically hydrolyzes such overhangs to yield a nick. Overhangs are generated by polymerization, but after every polymerization step, either polymerase or exonuclease can act— 55% of the time, polymerization occurred first. At this frequency overhangs of ⩾12 nucleotides are generated every 1300 nucleotides polymerized. We suggest that many DNA strand discontinuities are displaced single-strand overhangs, rather than gaps or simple nicks."
https://openalex.org/W2040388235,"Wild-type lambda repressor activates transcription from the lambda PRM promoter by stimulating the rate-limiting isomerization step in the initiation reaction. The positive-control mutants of lambda repressor retain the ability to bind operator DNA normally, but fail to activate transcription from the lambda PRM promoter in vivo. We have characterized one of these mutants in vitro, and have determined the biochemical nature of the defect. We show that the mutant repressor was deficient in its ability to stimulate the isomerization step in transcription initiation. The initial binding of RNA polymerase to PRM was only slightly reduced by the mutant repressor. We also found that the mutant and wild-type repressors had similar affinities for all three binding sites in the rightward operator. These results provide support for the hypothesis that direct repressor-RNA polymerase interactions are important in the PRM activation mechanism."

Mucins appeared to be poor acceptors. Methylation and hydrolysis of the product formed in an incubation with UDP-GlcNAc and asialo-alpha 1-acid [3H]glycoprotein yielded 2,4,6-trimethyl [3H]galactose and 2,3,4-trimethyl [3H]galactose, indicating that N-acetylglucosaminyl residues were introduced to position C-3 and C-6 of the terminal galactoses on the glycoprotein. It is concluded that Novikoff cells contain two N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases which might be involved in the synthesis of linear and branched forms of cell surface polylactosaminoglycans and blood group I/i antigenic structures."

https://openalex.org/W1502410387,"Quantitative measurements have been made of the interaction of human complement subcomponent C1q with mucopolysaccharides. The binding of C1q to heparin was quantitatively examined by utilizing an assay that employs a 125I-labeled low molecular weight heparin glycosaminoglycan (LMW-Hep) (Mr = 8500). Two classes of binding sites were detected. The first class of sites bound 2.02 mol of LMW-Hep/mol of C1q with a Kd of 76.6 nM. The second class of sites complexes with 12 mol of LMW-Hep with a Kd of 1.01 microM. The higher affinity-binding site for LMW-Hep could be assigned to the collagenous region of C1q (C1q-c); 2.2 mol of 125I-LMW-Hep were bound/mol of purified isolated C1q-c with a Kd = 381 nM. In contrast, the isolated C1q globular region did not bind to 125I-LMW-Hep. The binding of LMW-Hep to C1q and the C1q-c region was confirmed by fluorescence polarization experiments; C1q and C1q-c bound 2.3 and 2.02 mol of fluorescamine-labeled LMW-Hep/mol of protein, respectively. A variety of mucopolysaccharides were able to inhibit interaction of C1q with 125I-LMW-Hep, the most effective being heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate. LMW-Hep (2.5 nM) inhibited the ability of C1q (0.5 nM) to recombine with C1r (1.4 nM) and C1s (1.6 nM) to form hemolytically active C1. At 250 mM, LMW-Hep inhibited the hemolytic activity of reconstituted C1. The ability of mucopolysaccharides to interact with purified C1q suggests a role for such molecules in the regulation of the first component of complement."
https://openalex.org/W1583400983,"Membrane vesicles were isolated from purified liver lysosomes of rats treated with Triton WR-1339. In order to preserve ATP-dependent acidification activity, proteolysis of membranes was minimized by adding protease inhibitors and by centrifuging to form dilute bands of vesicles rather than highly concentrated pellets. The membrane vesicle fraction represented about 20% of the total lysosomal protein, 80% of the ATPase activity, and 3% of the solute proteins as marked by N-acetylglucosaminidase. About one-half of the membranes were oriented right side out. The space unavailable to [14C]sucrose corresponded to 3 microliters/mg of membrane protein which indicates that the membranes form vesicles about one-tenth the size of lysosomes. Uptake of either [14C]methylamine or [14C]chloroquine by lysosomal membrane vesicles was ATP-dependent, indicating acidification of the intravesicle space. The acidification activity was inhibited when either 1.5 microM carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxy-phenylhydrazone, 100 microM dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or millimolar concentrations of such permeant weak bases as ammonium sulfate and dansyl cadaverine were added. Acidification of lysosomal vesicles by ATP occurred electroneutrally. This acidification activity was not dependent on added salts but was inhibited by the anion transport inhibitors pyridoxal phosphate and diisothiocyanostilbene disulfonic acid, thus suggesting co-transport of protons and anions. Results which indicate that phosphate is the transported anion included (a) ATP-dependent uptake of [32P]phosphate by lysosomal membrane vesicles and (b) stimulation of ATP-dependent acidification of these vesicles by added phosphate. These observations provide further evidence that maintenance of the acid intralysosomal pH necessary for activation of lysosomal hydrolases is due to an ATP-driven proton pump located in the lysosomal membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1499753117,"Techniques are described for selectively removing the carbohydrate moieties from the high mobility group (HMG) 14 and 17 proteins of Friend erythroleukemia and calf thymocyte cells without causing degradation of these nonhistone proteins. Investigations were therefore undertaken to investigate the possible significance of this secondary biochemical modification by comparing the activity of the HMGs with and without their glycosyl side chains in various functional assays of the proteins. For example, these HMGs have been found to be equally effective in the partial inhibition of the histone deacetylase enzymes of mammalian cell nuclei whether or not they contain covalently bound carbohydrate residues. We also investigated the possibility that the glycosyl modifications might be involved in the reported ability of these HMGs to specifically cause reconstitution of the DNase I-sensitive structure of genes in salt-depleted chromatin. Unexpectedly, in experiments with both the active beta-globin gene of Friend cells and the total complement of active genes in these same mouse cells (which can be preferentially labeled by nuclear nick translation) we have been unable, using purified HMG 14 and 17 preparations, to reconstitute the active DNase I structure of genes in salt-depleted chromatin preparations. Therefore, the possible role, if any, played by HMG glycosylation in such reconstitution experiments remains unknown. However, in the course of these experiments we did find that HMG 14 and 17 proteins covalently linked to carbohydrate side chains bind preferentially to the nuclear protein matrix of mammalian cells. Furthermore, this association appears to be mediated through the glycosyl side chains since enzymatic removal of these modifications from the HMGs greatly reduced their binding to the nuclear matrix. Since numerous workers have implicated the nuclear matrix as the site of both RNA transcription and DNA replication in eukaryotic cells, the finding of HMG association with this nuclear structure may have significance for our understanding of the overall architectural organization of the active domains of chromatin in cells."
https://openalex.org/W168738858,"In order to characterize the form of the phosphorylated Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum which occludes the calcium bound in the enzyme (Takisawa, H., and Makinose, M. (1981) Nature (Lond.) 290, 271-273), a kinetic method was developed allowing quantitation of the amount of ADP-sensitive and ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme. The relationships between occluded Ca2+ in the enzyme and the two forms of phosphoenzyme were studied at various concentrations of CaCl2 and MgCl2. The amount of tightly bound Ca2+ in the phosphoenzyme increases concordantly with the increase in the amount of ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme, suggesting that occlusion of Ca2+ occurs in the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme. These results suggest that 1 mol of ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme occludes 2 mol of Ca2+. Ca2+ is released from the enzyme under conditions which favor the formation of the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme (e.g. 5 mM MgCl2 and 50 microM CaCl2). Ca2+ release correlates approximately with the formation of the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme. The simulated time course of Ca2+ release, based on the Ca2+-binding properties of the two forms of phosphoenzyme, shows a good fit with the Ca2+ release curves observed, indicating that the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme binds no Ca2+ under these conditions."

Transformants containing intact copies of the C3 gene were isolated and shown by primer extension analysis to produce C3 transcripts that had authentic 5′ termini. The steady state level of the transcripts was under androgen control in three cell lines tested which had low copy numbers of the intact C3 gene, but was not regulated in a cell line which had a very high C3 gene copy number.

The purification was about 10- and 100-fold over the enzyme activities of matrix vesicle fraction and cell homogenate, respectively. The pyrophosphohydrolase and alkaline phosphatase were separated by a sequential application of Sepharose CL-6B and DEAE-cellulose column chromatographies. The purified enzyme migrated as a single band corresponding to the molecular weight of 230,000 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide disc gel by electrophoresis. The enzyme absolutely required Zn2+ for its activity and appeared to bind Zn2+ strongly with an apparent affinity of p[Zn2+]0.5 = 13.4. The apparent Km for ATP was 0.18 mM. The enzyme was also reactive toward various nucleoside triphosphates including GTP, CTP, and UTP. In contrast, various phosphodiesters including RNA, UDP-glucose, NAD, and bis-p-nitrophenylphosphate were 5% or less as reactive as the nucleoside triphosphates. The pyrophosphohydrolase was inactive toward adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate or various phosphonates. UDP-glucose (1 mM), NAD (1 mM), or RNA (1 mg/ml) failed to inhibit the ATP pyrophosphohydrolase activity. These observations suggest that the ATP pyrophosphohydrolase of the cartilage is probably not a phosphodiesterase I. The matrix vesicle fraction, which probably also included some plasma membrane vesiculated during collagenase digestion, contained the highest specific activity of the enzyme as compared to other subcellular fractions of either epiphyseal or articular cartilage."
https://openalex.org/W1510904966,"The [H+]-ATPase of the Neurospora plasma membrane is composed of a single Mr = 104,000 polypeptide (B. J. Bowman, F. Blasco, and C. W. Slayman, J. Biol. Chem. (1981) 256, 12343-12349). The carboxyl-modifying reagent N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) inactivates the ATPase with pseudo-first order kinetics, suggesting that one site on the enzyme is involved. The rate constant for inactivation at pH 7.5 and 30 degrees C is approximately 1000 M-1 min-1, similar to values reported for the DCCD-binding proteolipid of F0-F1-type [H+]-ATPases and for the sarcoplasmic reticulum [Ca+2]-ATPase. Although hydrophobic carbodiimides are inhibitory at micromolar concentrations, a hydrophilic analogue, 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide, is completely inactive even at millimolar concentrations. This result implies that the DCCD-reactive site is located in a lipophilic environment. [14C]DCCD is incorporated into the Mr = 104,000 polypeptide at a rate similar to the rate of inactivation. There is no evidence for a separate low molecular weight DCCD-binding proteolipid. Using quantitative amino acid analysis, we established that complete inhibition occurs at a stoichiometry of 0.4 mol of DCCD/mol of polypeptide. Overall, the results are consistent with the idea that DCCD reacts with a single amino acid residue of the Neurospora [H+]-ATPase, thereby blocking ATP hydrolysis and proton translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1757543239,"Glycolysis in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells suspended in buffer containing 5 mM Pi was 50% inhibited by ouabain. In the absence of Pi the inhibition was less striking. Permeabilization of the cells with filipin abolished glycolysis, but glycolysis was restored by addition of Pi and AMP. Neither ouabain nor quercetin inhibited glycolysis in these permeabilized cells. We conclude that quercetin did not inhibit hexokinase sufficiently to affect glycolysis. An extract of Ehrlich ascites tumor cells glycolyzed weakly unless either Pi or an ATPase (e.g. (Na+K+)-ATPase) was added. The low rate of glycolysis of the extract was even further reduced when an endogenous ATPase was removed by precipitation with CaATP. The glycolytic activity of this ATPase-deficient extract was restored by addition of purified (Na+K+)-ATPase or of CaATP-precipitable ATPase. Addition of hexokinase without Pi did not restore glycolytic activity to the extract. An explanation for the contradictory conclusions by Bustamante, E., Morris, H.P., and Pedersen, P.L. (J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1494895690,"Selective proteolysis has been used to delineate the hemoglobin-binding site on haptoglobin heavy chain. Haptoglobin was cleaved specifically by plasmin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, staphylococcal protease, and thermolysin. Haptoglobin-hemoglobin complex was treated with these enzymes to determine which sites were protected from cleavage by the hemoglobin. The modified haptoglobins were tested for changes in their hemoglobin and hemoglobin alpha chain-binding properties. The sites of proteolytic cleavage were identified from the newly generated NH2 termini by automated Edman degradation amino acid-sequencing techniques. The results suggest that residues 128 through 131, 136 and 137, as well as 9 and 10 of the heavy chain may be involved in the binding of hemoglobin. On the other hand, residues 159 and 160, which lie in the 17-residue additional loop that is unique to haptoglobin among its homologous serine protease family, and residues 73 and 74, which lie close to the carbohydrate-binding residues, appear to be remote from the hemoglobin-binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1568102934,"Treatment of the purified plasma membrane [H+]-ATPase of Neurospora crassa with the sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) leads to a marked inhibition of ATPase activity. Several lines of evidence indicate that inhibition is caused by the reaction of NEM with a single cysteine residue on the Mr = 104,000 polypeptide. (1) Inhibition by NEM follows pseudo-first order kinetics. (2) MgADP protects against NEM inactivation and at the same time decreases the incorporation of [14C]NEM into the Mr = 104,000 polypeptide. When [14C]NEM incorporation is plotted as a function of inhibition of ATPase activity, a linear relationship is observed with a slope of 0.8. (3) Labeling of the ATPase with [14C]NEM can be restricted to the protectable site by pretreatment with cold NEM in the presence of MgADP, followed by an incubation with [14C]NEM in the absence of nucleotides. When this is done, and the enzyme is subjected to tryptic mapping and autoradiography, a single radioactive peptide fragment is found. The protectable site may yield information about the role of cysteine in the ATPase mechanism, and should also serve as a useful point of reference in enzyme mapping studies."

In this model, only the 11,000-dalton subunit would be phosphorylated. The partial dissociation of the 23,000-dalton phosphorylated protein would result in the formation of the 19,000 (11,000 + 8,000)-dalton or the 15,000 (11,000 + 4,000)- dalton phosphorylated components.

https://openalex.org/W1608929964,"Small unilamellar vesicles (75-100 nm diameter) and large liposomes (greater than 1 micron in diameter) were prepared containing the lamB protein, an outer membrane protein of Escherichia coli and Shigella which serves as the receptor for bacteriophage lambda. Bacteriophage were observed to bind to these liposomes and vesicles by their tails and in most cases the heads of the bound bacteriophage appeared empty or partially empty of DNA. The lambda DNA was usually only partially ejected from the bacteriophage head when small unilamellar liposomes were used, presumably because the vesicles are too small to contain all the DNA. The partially ejected DNA was not susceptible to DNase unless the vesicle bilayer was first disrupted suggesting that DNA injection of phage DNA into the vesicle had occurred. After disruption of these vesicles on electron microscope grids, the bacteriophage are seen to have partially empty heads and a small mass of DNA associated with their tails. Using larger liposomes prepared by the fusion of lamB bearing vesicles with polyethylene glycol and n-hexyl bromide, the heads of most of the bound bacteriophage appeared to be completely empty of DNA. Disruption of these preparations on electron microscope grids revealed circular arrays of empty-headed bacteriophage surrounding DNA which had apparently been contained within the intact liposomes. These results indicate that high molecular weight DNA can be entrapped within liposomes with high efficiency by ejection from bacteriophage lambda. The possible use of these DNA-containing liposomes to facilitate gene transfer in eukaryotic cells is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1561610742,"The Ca2+-dependent ATPase was solubilized from rat heart sarcolemmal membranes upon digestion with trypsin and was found to be different from Ca2+-stimulated Mg2+-dependent ATPase (Dhalla, N. S., Anand-Srivastava, M. B., Tuana, B. S., and Khandelwal, R. L. (1981) J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 13, 413-423). The enzyme was purified by high speed centrifugation, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and column chromatography and was seen as a single protein band in nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In sodium dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gels, the enzyme dissociated into two subunits or fragments with molecular weights of about 55,000 and 12,000. The molecular weight of the enzyme, estimated by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-100 column, was found to be about 67,000. The enzyme utilized ATP with a Km of 0.20-0.26 mM but was also able to utilize ITP, CTP, GTP, and ADP as substrates at much lower rates. It was activated by Ca2+ with a Ka of 0.13-0.21 mM; it was also activated by other cations in the order Ca2+ greater than Mn2+ greater than Sr2+ greater than Ba2+ greater than Mg2+. Divalent cations like Cu2+, Ni2+, and Mg2+ were potent inhibitors. The enzyme was insensitive to ouabain, verapamil, oligomycin, cyanide, and vanadate but was markedly inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide. Calmodulin failed to stimulate Ca2+-dependent ATPase and instead inhibited slightly. Unlike K+, Na+ produced a marked inhibition of the Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity, and this inhibition was associated with an 8- 10-fold decrease in the affinity of the enzyme for Ca2+. The competitive action of Na+ indicates that the Ca2+-dependent ATPase may be a site of Na+-Ca2+ antagonism in the cell membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1511656221,"A study of the initial velocity kinetics of the Escherichia coli transcription termination protein rho, with respect to its poly(C)-dependent ATPase, indicates that this reaction occurs by an ordered sequential mechanism. Product inhibition and substrate analogue studies suggest that ATP binding must precede the binding of poly(C) and that the order of release of the products is ADP followed by Pi, then poly(C). A possible mechanism for relating the ATPase to the termination reaction of rho is discussed in relation to the model for rho proposed by Richardson (5)."
https://openalex.org/W1570915566,"Mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae completely lacking the soluble glycolytic enzyme fructose-6-P kinase are described. The mutations are semidominant, do not complement one another, and define a gene PFK1 located 28-cm distal to rna1 on the extended right arm of chromosome XIII. Of 10 independent mutants, 3 can be suppressed by ochre suppressors. All mutants examined synthesize proteins that cross-react to the antibody against the purified yeast P-fructokinase. The enzyme in spontaneous revertants is distinguishable from the wild type enzyme with respect to thermolability and ATP inhibition. The locus PFK1 thus defines the structural gene of the enzyme. The pfk1 mutants are not leaky in vivo. All the glucose consumed by a double mutant lacking both P-fructokinase and 6-P-gluconate dehydrogenase ends up as 6-P-gluconate, yet the pfk1 mutants can glycolyze and grow on glucose in air. The cell mass produced per unit of glucose also remains unchanged. Anaerobically, however, growth does not take place, nor does glycolysis. P-fructokinase is thus a dispensable enzyme for aerobic growth, but indispensable for anaerobic growth. The properties of pfk1 mutants suggest that yeast has an alternative mechanism for the aerobic metabolism of fructose-6-P, presumably through the recently reported particulate P-fructokinase (Lobo, Z., and Maitra, P. K. (1982) FEBS Lett. 137, 279-282)."
https://openalex.org/W1515437982,"The structure of thin crystalline plates of beef heart F1-ATPase has been investigated by a combination of electron microscopy and computer-based image processing. Both negatively stained thin crystals and thin sections of embedded crystals were used in the analysis. Some inherent twinning was observed in the thin crystals and two distinct orthorhombic crystal forms present in the microcrystal population were characterized. The form I crystals are space group P2(1)2(1)2 with unit cell parameters of a = 164 A, b = 324 A, and c = 118 A. The form I crystals have 1 molecule of beef heart coupling factor-ATPase/asymmetric unit and averaged reconstructions of projections of the (001) and (100) planes allowed the deduction of the packing of single F1-ATPase complexes in the crystals. The form II crystals have unit cell parameters of a = 156 A, c = 162 A, beta = 90 degrees and are either space group P2(1)2(1)2 or P222(1). Furthermore, based on the results presented in this report, it is clear that the monoclinic crystalline inclusions which have been observed in human mitochondria are not directly related to the form I or form II crystals of the F1-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1557622894,"ATP synthesis and hydrolysis by Rhodospirillum rubrum chromatophores as well as the soluble RrF1-ATPase activity are inhibited by 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan (NBD-C1) in a dithiothreitol-reversible manner. Using the method earlier developed in these chromatophores to remove specifically the beta-subunit from their membrane-bound RrF1 leaving all other subunits attached to the resulting inactive beta-less chromatophores (Philosoph, S., Binder, A., and Gromet-Elhanan, Z. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 8747-8752), we have tested the effect of NBD-Cl also on the isolated beta-subunit and on the beta-less chromatophores before and after their reconstitution with the missing beta-subunit. The isolated purified beta-subunit as well as the RrF1-ATPase bind covalently [14C]NBD-Cl with an accompanying increase in absorbance at 385 nm, indicative of a tyrosyl-O-NBD bond. But, unlike the inactive RrF1-NBD complex, the beta-NBD adduct is as capable as the native beta-subunit to reconstitute beta-less chromatophores and restore their ATP synthesis and hydrolysis activities. On the other hand, incubation of beta-less chromatophores with NBD-Cl before or after their reconstitution with either native beta or the NBD-saturated beta adduct results in complete inhibition of their restored activities. It is, therefore, concluded that there are different binding sites for NBD-Cl on the isolated beta-subunit and on the beta-less chromatophores or on chromatophores reconstituted with the beta-NBD adduct, where the beta-site is already occupied. Furthermore, the site responsible for inactivation by NBD-Cl of the coupled and reconstituted chromatophores and of the soluble RrF1 is different from the site modified by NBD-Cl on the isolated beta-subunit. Its subunit location is as yet unknown."
https://openalex.org/W1489091607,"The carboxyl group reagents dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) and N-ethoxycarboxyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) inactivate the soluble Rhodospirillum rubrum F1-ATPase (RrF1). The inactivation is both time- and concentration-dependent and also pH-dependent, being more marked at acid pH. Under the same conditions, N-ethyl-5-phenylisoxazolium 3'-sulfonate causes almost no inactivation of the RrF1-ATPase. Complete inhibition of the enzyme activity requires the binding of 1 mol of DCCD/mol of RrF1. The isolated, reconstitutively active, beta-subunit of RrF1 is affected by the three carboxyl group reagents in a very similar manner to the RrF1-ATPase. Incubation of the beta-subunit with DCCD and EEDQ eliminates its capacity to rebind to beta-less chromatophores. Consequently the DCCD or EEDQ-modified beta-subunit cannot restore ATP synthesis or hydrolysis activities to the beta-less chromatophores. The interaction of the isolated beta-subunit with DCCD and EEDQ is both time and concentration dependent. The elimination of the reconstitutive activity of the beta-subunit by DCCD is accompanied with a covalent binding of about 1 mol of [14C]DCCD/mol of beta and is pH-dependent, showing a half-maximal effect at about pH 7.4. Divalent cations, inorganic phosphate, and to a lesser extent ATP and ADP decrease the binding stoichiometry of DCCD to the beta-subunit. Pretreatment of either RrF1 or its isolated beta-subunit with EEDQ reduces drastically their ability to bind [14C]DCCD, suggesting that in both RrF1 and the beta-subunit, EEDQ and DCCD might react at the same site. The similar effect of the carboxyl group reagents on RrF1 and on its isolated beta-subunit is in accord with the suggestion that DCCD and EEDQ affect the F1-ATPases by interacting with their beta-subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1504485620,"Isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles exhibited different functional characteristics in the presence of zwitterionic as compared to anionic buffers. In the absence of oxalate, dicarboxylic anions (e.g. maleate, succinate) in a dose-dependent manner enhanced ATP-supported Ca2+ accumulation, the ensuing spontaneous Ca2+ release, and Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity compared to zwitterionic buffers (e.g. piperazine-N,N'-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (Pipes) and 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) (Hepes). This was not attributed to ionic strength and osmotic effects. The additional anion-dependent Ca2+ accumulation was linked to augmented Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity, and both could be induced by the addition of anion at any time during Ca2+ accumulation as long as ATP was present. Since the initial Ca2+ accumulation rates and acyl phosphoenzyme formation were the same between the two buffer classes, and the presence of either oxalate (a Ca2+-precipitating anion) or A23187 (a Ca2+ ionophore) abolished differences in Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity between the two buffer classes, it is likely that conditions favoring high intravesicular Ca2+ concentration allow the expression of the observed effect of the anions. Initial spontaneous Ca2+ release in the presence of maleate was not caused by ATP depletion, and it was virtually absent in Pipes buffer. The rate of spontaneous release was also stimulated in a dose-dependent manner by the dicarboxylic anions, with the time of release being related to the time of anion addition and not ATP addition. A later, more rapid release phase in either maleate or Pipes buffer corresponded to ATP depletion, and could be duplicated at any time in the Ca2+ accumulation/release cycle by the addition of an ATP trap. With an ATP-regenerating system present or with very high ATP concentrations, the maximal peak Ca2+ accumulation in Pipes buffer could approach that in maleate buffer. The data suggest that dicarboxylic anions stimulate the filling of a Ca2+ compartment from which spontaneous Ca2+ release occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1520370615,"(Ca2+ + Mg2+)-dependent ATPase purified from sarcoplasmic reticulum was phosphorylated by [gamma-32P]ATP in the presence of ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, and magnesium up to levels of 1.0 mumol of phosphoenzyme/g of protein. In the presence of 30% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, phosphorylation by ATP measured in the absence of calcium was abolished by 100 mM NaCl or KCl. Optimal pH for phosphoenzyme formation was 5.5 to 6.0. The phosphoenzyme levels were not significantly affected by varying the temperature of the reaction medium in the range from 0 to 20 degrees C. Increasing dimethyl sulfoxide concentrations lead to a progressive increase of the steady state level of phosphoenzyme and to a decrease of both the velocities of formation and breakdown of phosphoenzyme. The observed decrease of phosphoenzyme hydrolysis was greater than that of formation, accounting for the higher phosphoenzyme levels observed with increasing dimethyl sulfoxide concentrations. Phosphoenzyme formed from ATP in the absence of calcium is an acylphosphate-type compound, as demonstrated by its pH and hydroxylamine sensitivity. The phosphate radioactivity was incorporated into the (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase as shown by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Controls were performed that eliminate both the possibility of calcium bound to the enzyme and the possibility of enzyme phosphorylation by contaminant 32Pi."
https://openalex.org/W1650544130,"The aim of the present study is to elucidate the enzymological and chemical properties of the plasminogen activator in bile, bilokinase. A bilokinase preparation was obtained from 94.2 liters of bovine gall bladder bile through seven purification steps, two of which employed a precipitation method in which ammonium sulfate and acetone were used sequentially. Twenty mg of bilokinase preparation with a specific activity of 5,900 IU/mg were obtained, for a 9% yield with 6,556-fold purification. This preparation revealed a single band upon disc electrophoresis. The bilokinase was a 3.32 S protein and its molecular weight was found to be 57,000. Isoelectric focusing showed that the bilokinase was separable into 5 fractions having different isoelectric points ranging from pH 7.4 to 9.0 The properties of the individual fractions have not yet been determined. The enzymatic activity of bilokinase was recognized to be heat-labile and to be stable at pH 4.0. The activation of plasminogen by bilokinase took place most effectively at pH 7.8 in a manner similar to that of urokinase. In its hydrolysis of both N alpha-acetylglycyl-L-lysine-methyl ester-acetate and H-D-Glu-Gly-Arg-pNA (S-2227), bilokinase showed similar Km values to those of urokinase; however, they were quite distinct from those of plasmin. It was concluded therefore that bilokinase is a plasminogen activator with enzymatic properties which are quite similar to those of the urinary plasminogen activator urokinase. The origin of bilokinase and its relation to liver function are now under investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1573394322,"A comparison of the transient kinetics of cardiac ventricular normal and hyperthyroid modified myosin subfragment-1 reveals substantial similarities between the two proteins. The nucleotide-binding kinetics are nonexponential for both proteins, but the large tryptophan fluorescence changes, 34% for ATP binding and 12% for ADP binding which are comparable to those of rabbit skeletal myosin subfragment-1, permit the kinetic data to be resolved into a sum of two exponentials. Both the fast and slow forms of the proteins reach limiting rate constants at high nucleotide concentration. The fast forms of normal and thyrotoxic cardiac subfragment-1 are kinetically identical for nucleotide binding at 20 degrees C and pH 7 and the slow forms differ by less than a factor of 2. The kinetic data for ADP release and the single turnover of ATP could neither be fit by a single exponential nor resolved into two components, which indicates a difference in the rate constants by a factor of 2 or less. The largest difference found was in the steady state turnover of ATP for which thyrotoxic subfragment-1 had a 2.5 times faster turnover as compared to normal subfragment-1. The fractions of fast and slow forms of the two proteins are dependent on the nucleotide concentration and the fractions as well as the rate constants are a function of the protein concentration. This is consistent with the kinetic heterogeneity of cardiac myosin subfragment-1 resulting from aggregation. The differences in the rate constant for the steady state turnover of ATP and in aggregation properties between normal and hyperthyroid cardiac subfragment-1 are consistent with the induction of a myosin isozyme by thyroxine treatment. Moreover, the increase in the steady state turnover of ATP is consistent with the increase in contractility of the muscle in the hyperthyroid state."

https://openalex.org/W1497144587,"The trifunctional beta-subunit of anthranilate synthase complex of Neurospora crassa has been purified from a mutant which produces no detectable alpha-subunit. The isolated beta-subunit appeared to be a highly asymmetric dimer with a s20,w of 7.35 and an apparent molecular weight of 200,000 as determined by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-300 compared with a monomer molecular weight of approximately 84,000 Da as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The purified subunit was cleaved by elastase, trypsin, or chymotrypsin into fragments which retained the three enzyme activities. After elastase digestion, two active fragments were separated by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. A 30,000-Da fragment, which behaved as a monomer on gel filtration, interacted with free alpha-subunit to produce glutamine-dependent anthranilate synthase activity. A second 56,000-Da fragment, which behaved as an asymmetric dimer (apparent molecular weight 140,000) on gel filtration, retained both N-(5'-phosphoribosyl)anthranilate isomerase and indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase activity. The failure to detect an NH2-terminal amino acid residue on either the intact beta-subunit or the 30,000-Da complementing fragment, while the 56,000-Da fragment possessed an NH2-terminal histidine residue, indicated that the complementing fragment was derived from the NH2-terminal sequence of the beta-subunit."
