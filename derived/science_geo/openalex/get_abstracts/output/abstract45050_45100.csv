https://openalex.org/W1529552889,"As an approach to defining the molecular basis for the periodic expression of thymidine kinase activity during the cell cycle, we have examined properties of the cytosolic enzyme in cycling HeLa cells synchronized by centrifugal elutriation and mitotic selection. By immunoblot analyses with a specific antiserum raised against the purified HeLa enzyme, we have demonstrated that changes in the levels of thymidine kinase activity reflect similar changes in the levels of thymidine kinase polypeptide. In contrast, the steady state levels of thymidine kinase mRNA show relatively small changes during the cell cycle. Using pulse labeling methods, we have shown that the synthetic rate of thymidine kinase protein is about 10-fold greater in S phase than in G1 phase, indicating that the efficiency of translation of thymidine kinase mRNA increases as cells begin DNA replication. In addition, the stability of thymidine kinase protein dramatically decreases upon cell division, resulting in the rapid clearance of the enzyme from newly divided G1 cells. Thus, two different post-transcriptional mechanisms largely account for the periodic behavior of the enzyme activity during the cell cycle."

https://openalex.org/W1894369717,"Platelet-derived growth factor is expressed as dimers of two homologous polypeptide chains, termed A and B, encoded by different genes. A and B chain mRNA levels in microvascular endothelial cells are increased by phorbol ester, thrombin, and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and are reduced by agents that elevate cyclic AMP. In this report, we investigated the effects of these regulatory agents on A and B chain transcription rates. By nuclear run-on analysis, TGF-beta stimulated transcription of both A and B chain genes. Thrombin and phorbol ester stimulated B chain transcription and had little or no detectable effect on A chain transcription. Pretreatment of cultures with 50 microM forskolin, a potent activator of adenylyl cyclase, completely blocked B chain transcription by thrombin and TGF-beta, but did not inhibit A chain transcription induced by TGF-beta. These results show that expression of platelet-derived growth factor mRNA involves both positive and negative transcriptional regulation and that there are differences in the transcriptional control of the A and B chain genes."

https://openalex.org/W1529027655,"We have isolated and characterized cDNA clones for both the rat and human liver microsomal GSH S-transferase (mGST) mRNAs. The rat sequence is 883 nucleotides long with 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions of 55 and 360 nucleotides, respectively, and contains two polyadenylation signals. The highest level of mRNA expression occurs in the rat liver, with widely varied levels of expression in extrahepatic tissues. Primer extension of rat liver poly(A) RNAs showed that only 12 nucleotides exist beyond the isolated cDNA. Southern blotting analysis of rat genomic DNA showed that this gene resides in a single EcoRV band of approximately 23 (kilobases) kb. Digestions with other restriction enzymes were consistent with the microsomal GST gene being a single copy gene with at least 3 exons spanning less than 12 kb. Human microsomal GST cDNAs were also characterized, and a 909 nucleotide sequence was determined with 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions of 74 and 368 nucleotides, respectively. RNA blot hybridization of human liver mRNA demonstrated that the human mGST is very similar in size to the rat mGST poly(A) RNA. Both the rat and human sequences contain a 154-amino acid reading frame and both show the same seven amino acid changes compared to the previously published protein sequence which upon reevaluation reveals the cDNA-deduced sequence to be correct. These two transcripts share 77% nucleotide similarity in the coding region, 47% in the 5'-untranslated regions and 61% in the 3'-untranslated regions. The rat and human microsomal GSTs show 95% conservation in amino acids. Several lines of evidence suggest that neither transcript contains a membrane-directing cleavable signal sequence."
https://openalex.org/W1493816947,"The diversity of protein structure is significantly enhanced by cotranslational and posttranslational modifications. Structural features at the amino terminus are especially important contributors to protein function and stability. Amino-terminal processing of cytosolic proteins includes the cleavage of the initiator methionine and N alpha-acetylation. To better understand the rules that govern these cotranslational events, site-directed mutants of the human beta-globin gene encoding for all 19 amino acid replacements of Val-beta 1 were expressed in a cell-free transcription and translation system. The initiator methionine was 100% cleaved when the side chain of the adjacent residue was relatively small (radius of gyration less than 1.29 A), whereas the initiator methionine was 100% retained when the side chain was relatively large. The extent of N alpha-acetylation ranged from 0 to 100% depending on the amino-terminal sequence. The experimental results in this cell-free system faithfully mimic what occurs in nature as judged by the structures of normal and variant human hemoglobins as well as a broad spectrum of other cytosolic proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1489708200,"Apolipoprotein E (apoE), unlike the other major lipoproteins, is synthesized in a variety of tissues. We examined which regions of the human apoE gene contributed to its tissue-specific expression using HepG2 and HeLa cells as examples of expressing and nonexpressing tissues, respectively. Regions between -360 bp and -80 bp and within the first intron were shown to be necessary for full expression activity in HepG2 cells by a nuclease protection assay which demonstrated correct transcriptional initiation of the transfected constructions. To fine map the regulatory regions, we constructed a series of deletions fused to the reporter gene chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. We discovered eight regions which had a positive effect on expression and three regions that had a negative effect on expression, in both HepG2 and HeLa cells. In addition we found three regions which had a tissue-specific negative effect on expression in HeLa cells and one region with a tissue-specific positive effect in HepG2 cells. A DNase I protection assay revealed eight footprints within the proximal 5'-flanking sequence and the first intron. Seven of these footprints fell within closely defined regions with positive expression activity. Sequence analysis of these footprint elements revealed the presence of previously identified elements and two novel elements related to each other, identified here as B1 and B2. We also defined another repeated sequence, the A element; all three of the tissue-nonspecific negative regions contained this element or sequences with homology to it. In the context of a heterologous promotor, a synthetic oligonucleotide containing the B1 and B2 elements behaved like a classical enhancer, having a positive effect on expression, even when placed at a distance. This effect was neutralized by a different synthetic oligonucleotide containing an A element repeat."
https://openalex.org/W1524812740,"To map transcriptional events associated with mineralization in developing long bones, we have established protocols for preparing RNA from regions of chick epiphyseal cartilage. Using these RNA preparations, we have probed for appearance of mRNA coding for type I, II, and X collagen, as well as osteonectin and calmodulin. Type II collagen mRNA was found in proliferating cartilage and, in lower amounts, in hypertrophic/calcifying cartilage. Type X mRNA was absent from proliferating cartilage and present in hypertrophic/calcifying cartilage at steady state levels slightly lower than that of type II mRNA. Type I mRNA was the major collagen mRNA species in endochondral bone; however, significant amounts of type X mRNA were also found. Examination of type X/type II ratios suggest that the cells producing type X mRNA in bone are different from those in the hypertrophic/calcifying cartilage region. Osteonectin mRNA was present in endochondral bone; however, significant amounts were also detected in precalcified cartilage. Indeed, the level of osteonectin mRNA was significantly higher in the resting/proliferating region than in the hypertrophic/calcifying region of the cartilage. No correlation was observed between calmodulin mRNA and the development of mineralization; levels of this message were slightly lower in endochondral bone, embryonic sterna, and calvaria than they were in chick liver and considerably lower than the calmodulin mRNA levels in chick brain."
https://openalex.org/W1557894700,"Human transferrin receptor is a disulfide-linked homodimer of 90-kDa glycoprotein subunits, capable of binding two transferrins. We report a new high yield affinity purification protocol for transferrin receptor from placenta which produces 3-4 mg of highly purified protein. Trypsin cleaves the protein at arginine-121, producing a stable fragment that contains 95% of the extracytoplasmic sequence; similar fragments are produced by several other proteases. The tryptic fragment is a nondisulfide-linked dimer in solution and binds two transferrin molecules. The dimensions of both the dimer fragment and its complex with transferrin are estimated by gel filtration."
https://openalex.org/W1538955993,"An oligoribonucleotide (35-mer) that mimics the alpha-sarcin and the ricin region of eukaryotic 28 S rRNA was transcribed in vitro from a synthetic template with T7 RNA polymerase and was used to test whether the specificity of the hydrolysis by the toxins was retained. alpha-Sarcin, at a low concentration, cleaved a single phosphodiester bond on the 3' side of a guanosine residue in the synthetic oligomer that corresponds to G-4325 in 28 S rRNA, the site of action of the toxin in intact ribosomes. At a high concentration of alpha-sarcin, the substrate (35-mer) was hydrolyzed after each of its purines. alpha-Sarcin was without an effect on a synthetic RNA (20-mer) that reproduces the near universal sequence of nucleotides in the loop, but lacks the stem, of the toxin's domain. Thus, the specificity of the attack of alpha-sarcin on a precise region of 28 S rRNA appears to be contingent on the sequence of the nucleotides and the structure of the domain. Ricin depurinated a nucleotide in the synthetic oligomer (35-mer), and in the presence of aniline the phosphoribose backbone was cleaved at a position that conforms to A-4324 in 28 S rRNA, the site of action of the toxin in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1522824956,"We characterized a de novo 4.5 kilobase pair deletion in the paternally derived alpha 2(I) collagen allele (COL1A2) from a patient with perinatal lethal osteogenesis imperfecta. The intron-to-intron deletion removed the seven exons which encode residues 586-765 of the triple helical domain of the chain. Type I procollagen molecules that contain the mutant pro-alpha 2(I) chain have a lower than normal thermal stability, undergo increased post-translational modification amino-terminal to the deletion junction, and are retained within the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The block to secretion appears to result from improper assembly of the triple helix, apparently a consequence of a disruption of charge-charge interactions between the shortened pro-alpha 2(I) chain and normal pro-alpha 1(I) chains. The lethal effect may be due to decreased secretion of normal collagen and secretion of a small amount of abnormal collagen that disrupts matrix formation."
https://openalex.org/W1583478748,"The Na+/Ca2+ antiporter is present in aortic smooth muscle cells of the A7r5 cell line. Imposing an outward Na+ gradient to the cells promoted a 45Ca2+ uptake component which was sensitive to amiloride derivatives and insensitive to blockers of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel. The Ca2+ uptake system was dependent on intracellular Na+ concentration; it was inactive when Li+ replaced intracellular Na+ and it was electrogenic. Flow cytometric analysis of cells that had been loaded with the Ca2+ indicator indo-1 showed that all conditions that promoted Ca2+ influx led to corresponding increases in the free cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration. Treatment of the A7r5 cells with phorbol myristate acetate, a known activator of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme), led to a two-fold activation of the system and to larger intracellular Ca2+ transients when cells were shifted to Na+-free solutions. Activation was observed at all intracellular Na+ concentrations. Changing the activity of the Na+/Ca2+ system did not affect the size and duration of intracellular Ca2+ transients elicited by the Ca2+ mobilizing hormone vasopressin. It is concluded that the Na+/Ca2+ antiporter in smooth muscle cells is a target for protein kinase C but that the system is not involved in the regulation of Ca2+ transients induced by vasopressin."
https://openalex.org/W2097769498,"Washed, buffered microsomes from bovine retinal pigment epithelium catalyze retinyl ester synthesis from retinol in the absence of an exogenous acyl donor. A plot of retinyl ester synthesis versus time reaches a plateau at 123 +/- 26 nmol of retinyl ester mg-1 microsomal protein, providing a minimum value of the concentration of the endogenous acyl donor. Fatty acyl-CoA analysis by three different methods employing high performance liquid chromatography resulted in the detection of less than 1 nmol mg-1 protein of acyl-CoA, indicating that fatty acyl-CoA is not the endogenous acyl donor. Stimulation of the rate of retinyl ester synthesis by palmitoyl-CoA or ATP, CoA, and palmitate is observed following its addition at the beginning of the reaction or after the endogenous acyl source has been exhausted by 20 min of reaction with retinol. Palmitate from [14C]palmitoyl-CoA is incorporated into retinyl ester at a rate similar to that for the incorporation of [3H] retinol, demonstrating the presence of an apparent acyl-CoA:retinol acyl transferase activity. The acyl group from palmitoyl-CoA can be transferred initially to a component of the microsomes and subsequently to retinol. The product of retinyl ester synthesis from all-trans-retinol and palmitoyl-CoA is all-trans-retinyl palmitate, indicating that the stereochemical configuration is retained during esterification. The kinetic parameters for the esterification of 11-cis-retinol and all-trans-retinol are similar."
https://openalex.org/W1560826405,"Abstract Monoclonal antibodies have been utilized to characterize the hepatocyte Na+-dependent bile acid transport system. Sinusoidal plasma membrane proteins in the 49-54-kDa range, which are thought to be components of this transport system, based on photo-affinity labeling and reconstitution studies, have been partially purified by affinity chromatography and utilized as an immunogen for the production of a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAb). One of these mAbs, 25A-3, recognized both a 49- and a 54-kDa protein as assessed by immunoprecipitation. In addition, it was shown to protect the bile acid transport system from inhibition by 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) in a dose-dependent manner. DIDS covalently labeled membrane proteins of 49 and 54 kDa, and this process could be significantly inhibited when performed in the presence of mAb 25A-3. Furthermore, the DIDS-labeled membrane proteins were immunoprecipitated by 25A-3. These results establish that one of these membrane components is the bile acid carrier protein. Another mAb (25D-1) which immunoprecipitated only a 49-kDa protein was shown to block the protective effect of 25A-3 on DIDS inhibition of bile acid transport. In addition both antibodies effected each other's binding capacity to hepatocytes and reacted with the same 49-kDa protein as established by sequential immunoprecipitation. Binding studies indicated that there are approximately 3.3 X 10(6) 49-kDa transport molecules/hepatocyte. These results firmly establish that the 49-kDa protein is the Na+-dependent hepatocyte bile acid transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1545819738,"Na+-driven flagellar motors of alkalophilic Bacillus were found to be inhibited by amiloride, a potent inhibitor for many Na+-coupled systems. A concentration of 0.5 mM of amiloride completely inhibited motility but showed almost no effect on the membrane potential, the intracellular pH homeostasis, and the ATP content of the cells. Furthermore, the activity of a Na+-coupled amino acid transport system was reduced only by half by this concentration of amiloride. Thus, the inhibition of motility of alkalophilic Bacillus by amiloride was rather specific. The inhibition of motility produced by amiloride was restored by increasing Na+ concentrations in the medium. Kinetic analysis of the data revealed that the inhibition was competitive with respect to the concentration of Na+ in the medium. Therefore, it is quite logical to assume that amiloride inhibits the rotation of the Na+-driven flagellar motors of alkalophilic Bacillus by competing with Na+ at the force-generating site of the motor. Some amiloride analogs known to selectively inhibit Na+ channels were potent inhibitors for the flagellar motors, suggesting that the Na+-interacting site of the motors has some similarity to that of the Na+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W1487547957,"A variety of different 4-substituted 1,4-dihydropyridine Hantzsch esters are substrates for ring dehydrogenation by a cytochrome P-450 (P-450) enzyme (P-450 UT-A); the substitutent could be varied from a hydrogen to a naphthalenyl, but a pyrenyl derivative was not dehydrogenated. When a 4-alkyl group is present, both the P-450 which oxidizes the substrate and other P-450s can be inactivated (by putative alkyl radicals). P-450s did not discriminate with regard to removal of the 4-H atoms from an enantiomeric pair of dihydropyridines. Losses of the 4-proton and N-methyl from a N-methyl-1,4-dihydropyridine occur at similar rates. The calculated intrinsic kinetic hydrogen isotope effect (Dk) for dehydrogenation of 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-4-phenyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester was 2.9 in a reconstituted P-450 UT-A enzyme system. No significant kinetic hydrogen isotope effect was observed in microsomal incubations for the dehydrogenation of this compound or 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid diethyl ester in a variety of competitive and noncompetitive experiments. In light of previous studies on the magnitude of kinetic hydrogen isotope effects in P-450 systems (e.g. Miwa et al., 1983 (Miwa, G. T., Walsh, J. S., Kedderis, G. L., and Hollenberg, P. F. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 14445-14449], the mechanistic proposals of Augusto et al., 1982 (Augusto, O., Beilan, H. S., and Ortiz de Montellano, P. R. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 11288-11295)) for enzyme inactivation by 4-alkyl-substituted Hantzsch pyridine esters, and other precedents for sequential electron transfer in amine oxidation by P-450s, we interpret these results as being consistent with P-450-mediated 1-electron oxidation of dihydropyridines followed by the facile loss of the 4-proton, with subsequent electron transfer to complete the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1589567139,"Cytochrome P-450 (P-450)-catalyzed oxidation of 2,6-dimethyl-4-phenyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid diethyl ester gives rise to 2,6-dimethyl-4-phenyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid monoethyl ester and to 2-hydroxymethyl-6-methyl-4-phenyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid diethyl ester, identified in this work. A pyridine hydroxymethyl diester of the sort of the latter compound is novel; under acidic or dehydrating conditions the diester is readily converted to a cyclic lactone (2-hydroxymethyl-6-methyl-4-phenyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid 5-ethyl ester lactone). 2,6-Dimethyl-4-phenyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylic acid monoethyl ester was not hydroxylated to form this hydroxymethyl compound or lactone, but 1,4-dihydro-2-hydroxymethyl-4-phenyl-6-methyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxyli c acid diethyl ester was enzymatically oxidized to give both products. The rates of oxidative carboxylic ester cleavage and methyl hydroxylation varied among individual forms of P-450 tested. Experiments with 2H and 3H labels were used to estimate an intrinsic kinetic deuterium isotope effect of 15 for ethyl ester cleavage by rat liver P-450PB-B in a reconstituted system. Rat liver microsomal systems showed kinetic deuterium and tritium isotope effects of 8 and 11, respectively, and this deuterium isotope effect was not attenuated in either intra- or intermolecular competitive experiments. When deuterium was present in the ethyl (ester) groups, increases in the rate of 2-methyl hydroxylation were observed in rat liver microsomes and with purified P-450 beta NF-B (but not with P-450PB-B). Deuteration of the methyl groups gave rise to kinetic isotope effects of 7-11, but no increases were seen in the rates of ester cleavage. These studies and those on rates of substrate disappearance indicate that isotopically sensitive branching (metabolic switching) observed in these systems is not necessarily bidirectional."
https://openalex.org/W1569015609,"A human erythrocyte Band 3 peptide, affinity labeled with pyridoxal phosphate, was purified by a combination of gel permeation and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. The amino acid sequence of the transmembrane peptide was determined by sequencing subfragments of the peptide obtained from lysyl endopeptidase and staphylococcal proteinase V8 digestions. When a peptide containing the COOH-terminal of human erythrocyte Band 3 was also purified and sequenced, the affinity-labeled peptide was found to be located close to the COOH-terminal of Band 3, where it could be aligned with amino acid residues 852-927 of a murine erythrocyte Band 3, deduced from a nucleotide sequence of a cDNA clone (Kopito, R. R., and Lodish, H. F. (1985) Nature 316, 234-238). The amino acid sequence of the COOH-terminal region was highly homologous to that of murine Band 3. As a result, the sequence of the COOH-terminal peptide of Band 3 was established as follows. (Formula: see text). The pyridoxal phosphate binding site was identified as Lys-18 which corresponded to Lys-869 of the deduced sequence. It appears that the COOH-terminal region of Band 3 constitutes at least a part of the active center for anion transport in human erythrocyte membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1537941474,"Recent investigations have shown that the heart atrium is an endocrine tissue. In the present studies, high levels of peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), which catalyzes the formation of bioactive alpha-amidated peptides from their glycine-extended precursors, have been found in particulate fractions from bovine and rat heart atrium; only low levels of PAM activity were present in soluble fractions. Corresponding fractions from the ventricles contained 20-fold less activity. Immunocytochemical studies demonstrated that PAM was localized primarily to atrial cardiocytes, with a distribution resembling that of atriopeptin. Following differential centrifugation of rat atrial homogenates, most of the PAM activity was associated with crude granule fractions, with lesser amounts of activity associated with crude microsomal fractions. Upon further subcellular fractionation, PAM activity in the rat atrium was found primarily with immunoactive atriopeptin in fractions enriched in secretory granules. Following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, antisera to purified bovine pituitary PAM identified a 113,000-dalton protein in bovine atrial microsomes and secretory granules; the protein predicted from the sequence of the cDNA encoding bovine pituitary PAM is of similar size (Eipper, B. A., Park, L. P., Dickerson, I. M., Keutmann, H. T., Thiele, E. A., Rodriguez, H., Schofield, P. R., and Mains, R. E. (1987) Mol. Endocrinol. 1, 777-790). Northern blot analysis using cDNA probes encoding bovine pituitary PAM demonstrated higher levels of PAM mRNA in heart atrium than in anterior pituitary. Rat heart contains PAM mRNA species of 3.6 and 3.8 kilobases, the smaller mRNA species corresponding in size to the PAM mRNA expressed in rat anterior pituitary."
https://openalex.org/W1500936509,"The synthesis of a major collagen-binding glycoprotein of molecular weight 47,000 was previously shown to be altered by malignant transformation as well as by heat shock in chick embryo fibroblasts (Nagata, K., and Yamada, K.M. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7531-7536 and Nagata, K., Saga, S., and Yamada, K.M. (1986) J. Cell Biol. 103, 223-229). In this paper, we examined the synthesis of this heat shock protein (hsp47) in terms of possible functional precursors and its regulation after heat shock and transformation by Rous sarcoma virus. Actinomycin D inhibited the induction of hsp47 after heat shock. Messenger RNAs purified from chick embryo fibroblasts (CEF), heat-treated CEF, and transformed CEF were analyzed in an in vitro translation system. In vitro translated products readily bound to gelatin-Sepharose, and levels were increased after heat shock and decreased after transformation. The increase in mRNA after heat shock was shown more directly by Northern assay using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe. We identified two putative precursors of hsp47 using an in vitro translation/processing system and tunicamycin: one is a 42-kDa primary translation product and the second is a 41-kDa polypeptide lacking signal peptide and carbohydrate moieties. Both of these precursors are biologically active as determined by gelatin-binding activity, in contrast to the lack of binding activity of precursors in several other membrane-associated receptor systems."
https://openalex.org/W1615484104,"Bovine adrenal cortical microsomes possess high (Kd = 3.68 +/- 1.02 X 10(-9) M) and lower (Kd = 9.20 +/- 1.71 X 10(-8) M) affinity binding sites for inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate. The binding to these sites is rapid, saturable (reaches equilibrium by 15 min at 0 degrees C), and reversible. Competition studies with other inositol phosphate analogs indicate that the high affinity binding sites are clearly distinct from the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors which are, however, responsible for a fraction of the lower affinity binding. The characteristics of the inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate binding sites described are compatible with their possible receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W1615554109,"Abstract Band-shifting and DNase I footprinting analyses detected a specific DNA binding protein extracted from oviduct nuclei that binds to the ovalbumin gene 5' sequence between -1094 and -1125. This fragment, when inserted upstream of the SV40 or ovalbumin promoters fused to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene, enhances chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity 5-10-fold following transfection into CV1 cells. The sequence to which the oviduct factor binds contains a nuclear factor-1 (NF-1) half-site (GCCAA). An oligonucleotide matching the sequence of the adenovirus NF-1 binding site competed for binding to the -1100 footprinted region with a higher affinity than an oligonucleotide for the -1100 region itself. Similarly, the -1100 region oligonucleotide also competes for binding of the factor to the NF-1 oligonucleotide. These data suggest that the oviduct factor which binds to the -1100 region is an NF-1-like protein that serves as a steroid hormone-independent enhancer of the ovalbumin gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1573515145,"In an accompanying paper (Kennedy, M. C., Spoto, G., Emptage, M. H., and Beinert, H. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 8190-8193), it was shown that one cysteine per mol of aconitase is modified by a variety of sulfhydryl reagents. We have identified the tryptic peptide that contains the iodoacetamide-reactive cysteine. We have also demonstrated that this cysteine is the primary site of modification by phenacyl bromide (2-bromoacetophenone), a spin label analogue of N-ethylmaleimide (HO-461) and iodoacetate in both the 3Fe and 4Fe forms of aconitase. The amino acid sequence of the peptide containing the reactive cysteine from beef heart aconitase shares no homology with the reactive cysteine-containing peptide reported for pig heart aconitase (Hahm, K.-S., Gawron, O., and Piszkiewicz, D. (1981) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 667, 457-461). We also report the amino acid compositions and sequences of seven other cysteine-containing tryptic peptides from beef heart aconitase. However, none of the cysteinyl peptides isolated were found to correspond to the reported pig heart reactive cysteinyl peptide. Evidence is also presented that no previously unreactive cysteine becomes exposed and reactive to sulfhydryl reagents in the conversion from the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the enzyme to the [3Fe-4S] cluster. We conclude from this that any potential cysteine ligand to the Fea site of the cluster must be inaccessible to solvent in the 3Fe form or, alternatively, that active 4Fe aconitase does not contain a cysteine ligand to the Fea site."
https://openalex.org/W1631638135,"Sn-protoporphyrin IX (SnPP), an inhibitor of heme oxygenase and a potential therapeutic agent for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, is bound tightly by hemopexin. The apparent dissociation constant (Kd) at pH 7.4 is 0.25 +/- 0.15 microM, but estimation of the Kd for the SnPP-hemopexin complex is hampered by the fact that at physiological pH SnPP exists as monomers and dimers, both of which are bound by hemopexin. SnPP is readily displaced from hemopexin by heme (Kd less than 1 pM). The hemopexin-SnPP interaction, like that of heme-hemopexin, is dependent on the histidine residues of hemopexin. However, as expected from the differences in the coordination chemistries of tin and iron, the stability of the histidyl-metalloporphyrin complex is lower for SnPP-hemopexin than for mesoheme-hemopexin. Nevertheless, when SnPP binds to hemopexin, certain of the ligand-induced changes in the conformation of hemopexin which increase the affinity of the protein for its receptor are produced. Binding of SnPP produces the conformational change in hemopexin which protects the hinge region of hemopexin from proteolysis, but SnPP does not produce the characteristic increase in the ellipticity of hemopexin at 231 nm that heme does. Competition experiments confirmed that human serum albumin (apparent Kd = 4 +/- 2 microM) has a significantly lower affinity for SnPP than does hemopexin. Appreciable amounts of SnPP (up to 35% in adults and 20% in neonates) would be bound by hemopexin in the circulation, and the remainder of SnPP would be associated with albumin due to the latter's high concentration in serum. Essentially no non-protein-bound SnPP is present. Importantly, SnPP-hemopexin binds to the hemopexin receptor on mouse hepatoma cells with an affinity comparable to that of heme-hemopexin and treatment of the hepatoma cells with SnPP-hemopexin causes a rapid increase in the steady state level of heme oxygenase messenger RNA. These results show that hemopexin participates in the transport of SnPP to heme oxygenase and in its regulation by SnPP."
https://openalex.org/W1506365814,"Plasmin cleaves rabbit serum apohemopexin (Mr = 60,000) at a single site producing a heme-binding domain (I, Mr = 35,000) and a second domain (II, Mr = 25,000) (W. T. Morgan and A. Smith (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12001-12005). The absorbance spectra of heme-domain I are indicative of a bis-histidyl coordination complex with the central heme iron atom. Chemical modification of the 5 histidine residues of apo-domain I with diethylpyrocarbonate abolished heme binding, supporting this assignment. Upon binding heme, domain I migrates more rapidly in sucrose gradients, and, in sedimentation velocity experiments, the s value of domain I increases from 3.17 +/- 0.04 to 3.71 +/- 0.09, a notably large increase which indicates that the domain becomes much more compact. This conformational change which plays a pivotal role in hemopexin function requires the bis-histidyl coordination with heme iron and leads to a tighter association between domain I and domain II shown by the co-migration of heme-domain I and domain II in sucrose gradients. In turn, the association of heme-domain I with domain II increases the thermal stability of the heme-domain I chromophore. Results of binding studies using mouse hepatoma cells and isolated domains indicate that domain I not only binds heme but also plays a vital part in the hemopexin-receptor interaction. The change in conformation of domain I upon heme binding and the association between domains I and II induced by heme are both notable determinants of the strength of the hemopexin-receptor interaction, but an intact hinge region between the domains is not necessary for receptor binding. The importance of both domains in bringing about the transport function of hemopexin is confirmed by the ability of three (two specific for domain I and one for domain II) of seven monoclonal antibodies raised against hemopexin to inhibit the hemopexin-receptor interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1534796958,"The insulin receptor from the liver of stingray, a cartilaginous fish, has characteristics which are in marked contrast to those of the mammalian insulin receptor. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cross-linked, affinity-labeled stingray insulin receptor shows an apparent molecular mass of 210 kDa for the intact receptor. Reduction with mercaptoethanol resulted in no alteration in the apparent size of the stingray insulin receptor. Gel filtration studies of Triton X-100 solubilized stingray insulin receptor demonstrated an apparent Stokes radius of 7.6 nm. Ultracentrifugation sucrose gradient studies of cross-linked affinity labeled stingray receptor resulted in determination of a sedimentation coefficient of 13 S. Both of these parameters were greater than simultaneously obtained data for the human insulin receptor (7.2 nm and 11 S, respectively). Unlabeled insulin competed with binding of 125I-insulin and 125I-insulin growth factor (IGF) I with a half-maximal concentration of 1 nM for either. Unlabeled IGF I and II also competed, but were 4-5-fold less potent than insulin. It was found that not only did IGF I bind to the 210-kDa material, but both insulin and IGF I stimulated phosphorylation of a 210-kDa material which was immunoprecipitable by a polyclonal insulin receptor antibody. Elution of this material from the gel followed by hydrolysis and thin layer chromatography demonstrated that the 210-kDa material was specifically phosphorylated on tyrosine only. These data suggest that the insulin receptor from stingray liver is a dimer made up of 2 identical subunits of about 210 kDa size which contain both binding regions and insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase. Specificity studies suggest that the stingray insulin receptor may represent a phylogenetic position prior to the evolutionary divergence of insulin and the insulin-like growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1523162871,"Two extracellular matrix cell surface proteins which bind the proteoglycan-like aggregation factor from the marine sponge Microciona prolifera (MAF) and which may function as physiological receptors for MAF were identified and characterized for the first time. By probing nitrocellulose blots of nonreducing sodium dodecyl sulfate gels containing whole sponge cell protein with iodinated MAF, a 210- and a 68-kDa protein, which have native molecular masses of approximately 200-400 and 70 kDa, were identified. MAF binding to blots is species-specific. It is also sensitive to reduction and is completely abolished by pretreatment of live cells with proteases, as was cellular aggregation, indicating that the 210- and 68-kDa proteins may be located on the cell surface. The additional observations that the 68 kDa is an endoglycosidase F-sensitive glycoprotein and that antisera against whole sponge cells or membranes can immunoprecipitate the 210 kDa when prebound to intact cells are consistent with a cell surface location. Both proteins can be isolated from sponge cell membranes and from the sponge skeleton (insoluble extracellular matrix), but the 210-kDa MAF-binding protein can also be found in the soluble extracellular matrix (buffer washes of cells and skeleton) as well. A third MAF-binding protein of molecular mass 95 kDa was also found in the sponge extracellular matrix but rarely on cells. Both of the cell-associated 210- and 68-kDa proteins are nonintegral membrane proteins, based on Triton X-114 phase separation, flotation of liposomes containing sponge membrane lysates, and their extraction from membranes by buffer washes. Both proteins bind MAF affinity resins, indicating that they each exhibit a moderate affinity for MAF under native conditions. They can also be separated from each other and from the bulk of the protein in an octylpolyoxyethylene extract of membranes by fast protein liquid chromatography Mono Q anion exchange chromatography, as assessed by native dot blot and denaturing Western blot assays. Although neither protein bound to heparin, gelatin, hexosamine, or uronic acid-Sepharose resins, their affinity for an invertebrate proteoglycan, their roles in sponge cell adhesion, and their peripheral membrane protein natures suggest that they may represent early invertebrate analogs of cell-associated vertebrate extracellular matrix adhesion proteins, such as fibronectin or vitronectin, or else an entirely novel set of cell adhesion molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1529319566,"Using a modified DNA mobility shift assay, we have identified and purified a novel 9-kDa polypeptide (designated p9) from plasmacytoma nuclear extracts which forms salt-stable DNA-protein complexes without apparent sequence specificity. In competition studies, p9 bound exclusively with naturally occurring DNA relative to RNA and preferentially with polydeoxypyrimidines among 10 homopolynucleotides tested. Nuclear extracts prepared from various murine and human cell lines contained a common factor which, when cross-linked with photoreactive [32P]DNA, co-migrated with covalent [32P]DNA-p9 complexes on polyacrylamide gels. An oligonucleotide, constructed on the basis of the N-terminal 29 amino acid residues of p9, was employed to isolate a 700-base pair cDNA clone encoding the complete polypeptide. On Northern blots, p9 cDNA hybridized with a mRNA species of comparable size from both mouse and human cell lines, suggesting a significant degree of interspecies sequence conservation. Amino acid and cDNA sequence analyses demonstrated that p9 derives from the 77-residue C-terminal domain of a 14-kDa polypeptide comprised of 127 amino acids. DNA binding activity was exhibited by peptides synthesized in vitro from run-off RNA transcripts corresponding to the truncated 9-kDa C-terminal domain, but not to the 14-kDa precursor, implicating proteolysis as a post-translational mechanism required for functional activation of p9."
https://openalex.org/W1606080269,"Abstract Treatment of rats fed a balanced Purina Chow diet with beta,beta'-tetramethyl-substituted hexadecanedioic acid (MEDICA 16) (Bar-Tana, J., Rose-Kahn, G., and Srebnik, M. (1985) J. Biol. Chem. 260, 8404-8410) resulted in an acute 70-80% decrease in plasma chylomicrons-triacylglycerols which was sustained as long as the drug was administered. The hypochylomicronemic effect resulted from an enhanced plasma clearance of chylomicrons whereas their intestinal production and absorption remained unaffected. Chylomicrons-triacylglycerols clearance in MEDICA 16-treated rats was characterized by a fast initial phase lasting for 1-2 min and consisting of elimination of 50-60% of the injected chylomicrons' tracer at a fractional clearance rate of 0.77 +/- 0.27 min-1 as compared to 0.08 +/- 0.01 min-1 in nontreated rats. The fractional clearance rate of chylomicrons-cholesterol ester was similarly affected by MEDICA 16 treatment and amounted to 0.48 +/- 0.05 and 0.05 +/- 0.01 min-1 in MEDICA 16-treated and nontreated rats, respectively. The increased fractional clearance rate of plasma chylomicrons in MEDICA 16-treated rats presumably reflects the primary action of the drug rather than being secondary to the hypochylomicronemic state, since it was similarly observed in MEDICA 16-treated animals made transiently normolipemic by loading them with intestinal lipid. The increase in the fractional clearance rate of plasma chylomicrons resulted from their enhanced uptake by the liver complemented with their activated extrahepatic catabolism. The activation of both catabolic modes in MEDICA 16-treated rats could be accounted for by a 10-fold decrease in the apoC-III content of plasma chylomicrons. No increase was observed in hepatic apoB,E or apoE receptors, nor in the maximal capacity of lipoprotein lipase. The pharmacological reduction of plasma apoC-III may thus offer a treatment mode of choice for selected hyperlipidemic states."
https://openalex.org/W1612696915,"Murine T-lymphomas and Thy-1- mutants were labeled overnight with [3H]ethanolamine to detect proteins which possess a glycophospholipid anchor. When labeled cells were treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and then analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography, both Thy-1 and a second intensely labeled protein (46 kDa) were observed. The presence of the radiolabeled 46-kDa protein in wild type and class E Thy-1 negative cells (cells in which Thy-1 is synthesized but cannot be labeled with [3H]ethanolamine) suggested incorporation into a distinct moiety. Labeling of the 46-kDa protein with [3H]ethanolamine is rapidly inhibited by cycloheximide. Further characterization of the 46-kDa protein by subcellular fractionation and Triton X-114 partitioning indicated that the protein is located in the cytosol. The protein is basic and does not bind to either concanavalin A or wheat germ agglutinin. Labeling of a 46-kDa protein has also been demonstrated in Chinese hamster ovary, COS, rat myeloma, cloned human T-lymphocytes, and HeLa cells. Pronase digestion of the [3H]ethanolamine-labeled 46-kDa protein of wild type lymphoma cells generated a nonbasic and polar labeled fragment which is labile to strong acid and base ([3H]ethanolamine is liberated), insensitive to periodate oxidation and alkaline phosphatase, and does not bind to concanavalin A or wheat germ agglutinin. Judging from methylation studies, the labeled ethanolamine residue does not contain a free amino group. Based on these results, we report a novel post-translational modification of selected protein(s) by the covalent addition of [3H]ethanolamine."

https://openalex.org/W1508815514,"A cDNA containing the complete genome of satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV) RNA was constructed and cloned into a plasmid vector containing the T7 polymerase promotor. A second clone containing the first 54 nucleotides from the 5' end, which includes the ribosome binding site, was also constructed. RNAs were transcribed from these plasmids (pSTNV1239 and pSTNV54) and tested for their ability to bind to wheat germ 40 S ribosomal subunits in the presence of wheat germ initiation factors eIF-4A, eIF-4F, eIF-4G, eIF-3, eIF-2, Met-tRNA, ATP, and guanosine 5'-(beta, gamma-imino)triphosphate (GMP-PNP). Maximal binding of the STNV RNA transcribed from pSTNV1239 is obtained only in the presence of all the initiation factors and ATP. In contrast, close to maximal binding of STNV RNA transcribed from pSTNV54 is obtained in the absence of eIF-4A, eIF-4F, eIF-4G, and ATP. A series of deletion clones from the 3' end of the STNV cDNA was prepared, and the requirements for binding to 40 S ribosomal subunits were determined. STNV RNAs containing more than 134 nucleotides from the 5' end require eIF-4A, eIF-4F, eIF-4G, and ATP for maximal binding to 40 S ribosomal subunits, whereas STNV RNAs containing 86 nucleotides or less no longer require ATP and these factors. These findings indicate that a region 3' to the initiation codon affects the requirements for eIF-4A, eIF-4F, eIF-4G, and ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1535934876,"Abstract Human erythrocyte ghosts catalyze a low rate of 32Pi uptake. A severalfold stimulation of 32Pi uptake was observed after exposure of the membranes to an erythrocyte lysate or to hemoglobin in the presence of Mg2+. Ghosts prepared from erythrocytes that had been exposed to 10 microM 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid showed a marked reduction in 32Pi uptake. Reconstitution of membranes with added phospholipids by freezing and thawing, by octylglucoside dilution or by cholate dialysis, yielded vesicles that catalyzed 32Pi uptake. When membranes were incubated with hemoglobin and Mg2+ prior to reconstitution, the rate of uptake was increased severalfold. The inhibition of hemoglobin and Mg2+-dependent uptake of 32Pi by chloride suggests that the transport in the reconstituted vesicles is catalyzed by the classical inorganic anion transporter."

https://openalex.org/W1519913135,"Cells from Dictyostelium discoideum carry chemotactic cAMP receptors on their surface. Kinetic studies have revealed the existence of two slowly dissociating, high affinity receptor forms (SS and S) and one or more fast dissociating, low affinity forms (F) (Van Haastert, P.J.M., and De Wit, R.J.W. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 13321-13328). We have studied the interaction of these different cAMP-receptor types with a detergent-insoluble membrane residue. Isolated D. discoideum membranes were extracted with the detergent 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate (CHAPS), which was previously shown to be the only detergent in the presence of which cAMP receptor binding is completely preserved (Janssens, P. M. W., and Van Driel, R. (1986) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 885, 91-101). The protein composition of the CHAPS-insoluble membrane residue appeared to be similar to that of the Triton X-100-insoluble membrane skeleton. Cyclic AMP binding studies revealed a specific association of the slowly dissociating cAMP receptors (SS and S forms) with this CHAPS-insoluble residue. All fast dissociating (F type) receptors were solubilized by CHAPS. GTP induced a transition of 75% of the SS and S receptors to faster dissociating forms. This transition was accompanied by the release of an equal number of receptors from the residue. These effects of GTP required that the cAMP receptor was occupied, and were completely reversible. After removal of the guanine nucleotide SS and S type receptors reappeared, bound to the residue, with a t1/2 of 5-10 min at 0 degrees C. We conclude that a detergent-insoluble membrane residue is involved in signal transduction via the chemotactic cAMP receptor. Both receptor occupation and a guanine nucleotide binding protein control receptor-residue interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1601564698,"When carbohydrates in aqueous solution combine with biological receptors, their interactions with the binding site take the place of previous interactions with solvent water. Free energies of binding can therefore be considered to depend on free energies of solvation of the interacting partners before and after complexation. Because carbohydrates contain so many polar substituents, their overall preferences for aqueous surroundings are overwhelming, so that they do not yield readily to analysis of their solvation properties. We therefore decided to eliminate most of the secondary hydroxyl groups and to compare the distribution properties of simple sugar analogs based on tetrahydropyran. The results suggest that compounds containing an anomeric hydroxyl group are less strongly solvated than expected from the properties of simple alcohols. Group transfer potentials of O- and N-glycosides, lactones, and acylals are substantially affected by differences in free energy of solvation between reactants and products. In contrast, equilibria of ring chain tautomerism and covalent hydration of aldoses are almost completely insensitive to the polarity of their surroundings."
https://openalex.org/W1620104059,"Na+-dependent amino acid transport can be reconstituted from solubilized Ehrlich cell plasma membranes by addition of asolectin vesicles, gel filtration, and a freeze-thaw cycle. Removal of phosphatidic acid (approximately 10% of the total lipid) by Ba2+ precipitation reduces the efficiency of reconstitution of Na+-dependent amino acid transport by approximately 73% and decreases intravesicular volume of the proteoliposomes by approximately 43%. The loss of transport activity is not due to exclusion of specific proteins during reconstitution. The phosphatidic acid-free liposomes are less permeable and require more time to attain an equilibrium distribution of solute. Transport activity and intravesicular volume can be restored to Ba2+-precipitated asolectin proteoliposomes by addition of egg-phosphatidic acid during reconstitution. The extent of recovery of transport activity is proportional to the change in intravesicular volume and depends on the amount of phosphatidic acid present. Replacement of phosphatidic acid with 20% phosphatidylserine or phosphatidylglycerol leads to increases in intravesicular volume with little or no increase in amino acid transport. Generation of phosphatidic acid in situ by treatment of Ba2+-precipitated proteoliposomes with phospholipase D also restored transport. The observed increase in transport activity (9-fold) is accompanied by a 46% increase in intravesicular volume, presumably caused by vesicle fusion. Phosphatidic acid is also required for successful reconstitution of Na+-dependent amino acid transport from pure phosphatidylcholine:phosphatidylethanolamine (1:1) mixtures with only a small change (approximately 16%) in intravesicular volume. The results provide evidence for both indirect and direct effects of phosphatidic acid on reconstitution of Na+-dependent amino acid transport. The indirect effects occur through enlargement of intravesicular volume, large vesicles showing higher rates of transport. However, there is also evidence to indicate a specific effect of phosphatidic acid on the Na+-dependent amino acid transporter, since other acidic lipids may change intravesicular volume without a commensurate change in transport activity."
