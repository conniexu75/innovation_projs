https://openalex.org/W2004228512,"Hyperglycemia and lesions of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans developed in some, but not all, adult mice infected with a variant of the encephalomyocarditis virus. Large amounts of virus were recovered from the pancreas during acute stages of infection. At this time blood glucose concentrations were markedly elevated and the islets of Langerhans exhibited focal necrosis and degranulation of beta cells. Evidence of abnormal glucose metabolism persisted for varying periods after recovery from the infection. The islets of Langerhans of chronically hyperglycemic mice were distorted and decreased in size, and the beta cells were degranulated. Encephalomyocarditis virus appears to cause diabetes mellitus by reducing the mass of functional beta cells of the islets of Langerhans."

https://openalex.org/W1527105416,"Abstract The electron paramagnetic resonance absorption of nitric oxide hemoglobin was observed as a possible model system for oxyhemoglobin. The electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum showed three g factors indicating a rhombic symmetry around the paramagnetic center. By use of 15NO, the unpaired electron was found very little associated with NO nitrogen, in contrast to what has been customarily assumed. Modifying NO-hemoglobin with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) shifted the whole spectrum toward a lower magnetic field retaining the rhombic symmetry. The 14N hyperfine structure was now resolved in one of the peaks with the splitting of 15 gauss. The number of SDS molecules to complete this transformation was found equal to the number of the basic amino acid residues. At high SDS concentrations (g0.2 m) further transformation of the spectrum took place which indicated the randomization of the structure and the change of symmetry type around the paramagnetic center from rhombic to axial. NO-hemoglobin powdered specimen after dehydration gave a spectral pattern indistinguishable from that of the SDS-modified NO-hemoglobin. This spectral conversion to dehydrated type could be repeated completely reversibly by evacuating and replenishing H2O vapor. The interaction with 0.03 to 0.5 m sodium salicylate resulted in a decrease of absorption with concomitant appearance of four new peaks, tentatively interpreted as due to a low spin Fe(III) type electronic configuration. The possible implication of the rearrangement of the electronic state was discussed in connection with the known oxidase-like activity of oxyhemoglobin under similar conditions."

The presence of antibodies to type 1 and type 2 herpesvirus was examined in patients with carcinoma of the cervix, in matched controls, random controls, and patients with other types of malignancy. Antibodies to type 2 were found with greater frequency in patients with carcinoma of the cervix (83 percent) than in the other groups tested (0 to 20 percent). The data suggest an association of genital herpesvirus and carcinoma of the cervix."

Adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) also stimulates fluid secretion and may be involved in the mode of action of 5-hydroxytryptamine."

https://openalex.org/W1578908619,"Abstract Cycloheximide, administered to rats in amounts that block protein synthesis in the adrenals, inhibits the stimulation of corticosterone production by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). In the present studies the effect of the antibiotic on the pathway of adrenal steroid hormone production from acetate to corticosterone is investigated. It is concluded that cycloheximide blocks the action of ACTH by preventing the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone (3β-hydroxypregn-5-ene-20-one)."

https://openalex.org/W1569256603,"Abstract The inhibition in vitro of a highly purified preparation of mevalonate kinase by terpenyl pyrophosphates has been studied. Geranyl-PP and farnesyl-PP are potent inhibitors, while isopentenyl-PP, dimethylallyl-PP, and inorganic pyrophosphate do not inhibit significantly. The kinetics of geranyl-PP inhibition were investigated further and found to be uncompetitive with respect to mevalonic acid and competitive with respect to MgATP2-. Computer analysis of the data gave values of 2.65 ± 0.14 µm for Kii and 1.19 ± 0.12 µm for Kis. These results are consistent with the suggestion that geranyl-PP and farnesyl-PP act as physiological controls over farnesyl-PP biosynthesis and ATP utilization."
https://openalex.org/W2087842705,Significant alcohol dehydrogenase activity has been demonstrated in the soluble fraction of rat brain and is very similar to the liver enzyme in kinetic properties and responses to inhibitors. A cerebral mechanism that oxidizes ethanol may play a significant role in local adjustments during exposure to ethanol and in the pathogenesis of the neural disorders associated with chronic alcohol ingestion or withdrawal.
https://openalex.org/W1549640468,"Abstract The reduction of retinal to retinol was examined with enzyme preparations from homogenates of rat intestinal mucosa. Retinal reduction was catalyzed by a soluble mucosal enzyme which was purified 13-fold by ammonium sulfate precipitation, column chromatography, and heating (55° for 6 min). The enzyme was relatively heat-stable and had a molecular weight approximately in the range of 60,000 to 80,000. The partly purified reductase was unable to oxidize ethanol in the presence of NAD+. Retinal reduction required NADH or NADPH as cofactor. Both reduced nucleotides were effective; at low nucleotide concentration NADH was more effective, whereas at high concentrations the reaction rate was slightly greater with NADPH. The reaction was stimulated by the addition of glutathione and was inhibited by —SH inhibitors. No other cofactors were required. There was a sharp pH optimum near 6.3. Retinal reduction displayed typical Michaelis kinetics, with a Vmax of 2 x 10-6 moles of retinal formed per hour per mg of protein and with an apparent Km of 2 x 10-5 m. The enzyme appears to be a relatively nonspecific aldehyde reductase. Short and medium chain aliphatic aldehydes, of length C-2 to C-14, were actively reduced, with greatest activity being seen with aldehydes of length C-4 to C-8. Unsaturated C-18 fatty aldehydes were reduced at a lesser rate, but saturated aldehydes of length C-16 or greater were not reduced. The enzyme was stereospecific for 4R-NADH-4-3H1, and did not incorporate tritium from 4S-NADH-4-3H1 into the product retinol."

https://openalex.org/W1615323035,"Abstract A micro method, employing the fluorescent 1-dimethyl-aminonaphthalene-5-sulfonyl (dansyl) group, was developed for the detection of the 1-l-β-aspartamido[-2-acetamido]-1, 2-dideoxy-β-d-glucose linkage in glycoproteins. With this procedure, dansyl 1-l-β-aspartamido[-2-acetamido]-1,2-dideoxy-β-d-glucose was isolated from an acid hydrolysis of the dansylated ribonuclease B glycopeptide. Similar results were obtained with the glycopeptide from ovalbumin. Confirmation for the N-acetylglucosamine-asparagine linkage was obtained with a glycopeptide amidohydrolase isolated from hen oviduct, an enzyme that hydrolyzes 1-l-β-aspartamido[-2-acetamido]-1,2-dideoxy-β-d-glucose to N-acetyl-glucosamine, aspartic acid, and ammonia. With the use of this enzyme it was shown that N-acetylglucosamine was on the reducing end of the polysaccharides enzymically released from the ribonuclease B and ovalbumin glycopeptides. Treatment of the ribonuclease B glycopeptide with periodate or β-N-acetylglucosaminidase did not affect the glucosamine content of the glycopeptide. These results indicate that the second glucosamine moiety of the ribonuclease glycopeptide is located internally in the polysaccharide and is glycosidically linked at either position 3 or 4."

https://openalex.org/W1583688387,"The activity of lactate dehydrogenase of the supernatant fraction of brain, heart, skeletal muscle, and liver of 1-day and 4-, 12-, 30-, 74-, and 96-week old rats was determined to study the changes in this enzyme with increasing age. Units of enzyme per g, wet weight, of all the tissues increased during the growth phase, reaching a maximum at 30 weeks, and then decreased. NADHL:NADHH ratios, Km values, and percentage of inhibition of lactate dehydrogenase by oxalate showed that the ratio of H-lactate dehydrogenase to M-lactate dehydrogenase increased after adulthood. This was due to a decrease of M-lactate dehydrogenase and not due to any increase in H-lactate dehydrogenase. Lower levels of lactate dehydrogenase and of M-lactate dehydrogenase in old age may make the tissues more oxygen dependent and decrease the period of tolerance for anaerobic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1485465502,"The circular dichroism and absorption spectra of pyridine dinucleotides are discussed with respect to interbase coupling of the electronic transitions. The presence of reciprocal relations in the circular dichroism spectra, shown by solvent, pH, and temperature studies, gives strong evidence that the interacted state is substantially populated at low temperatures for all pyridine dinucleotides studied. In α-DPN the 260 mµ adenine-210 mµ nicotinamide transitions vary reciprocally with solvent, pH, and temperature changes. In β-DPN the reciprocal behavior involves primarily the 266 mµ nicotinamide-260 mµ adenine transitions, giving rise to two adjacent circular dichroic bands of opposite sign and almost equal rotational strength. Studies on β-DPNH show that the coupling mainly involves the 260 mµ adenine-215 mµ dihydronicotinamide transitions, whereas in α-DPNH the 215 mµ dihydronicotinamide-210 mµ adenine bands couple, giving rise to two large, adjacent circular dichroic bands of approximately equal magnitude but opposite sign. These results are found to be qualitatively in accord with recent experimental and theoretical reports regarding the electronic structures of the adenine, nicotinamide, and dihydronicotinamide chromophores. A conformation consistent with the analysis is proposed for the interacted state of β-DPNH."

https://openalex.org/W1481169258,"Abstract The uptake and metabolism of nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, and quinolinic acid at physiological concentrations by perfused rat liver have been studied. At a level of 400 mµmoles per liver, nicotinic acid was a more effective precursor of NAD than was nicotinamide. Labeled NAD in the liver reached maximum levels 10 min after nicotinic acid was added to the perfusate. When nicotinamide was the substrate, methylated compounds were the major products identified. The absence of labeled nicotinamide mononucleotide as well as nicotinic acid mono- and dinucleotides precludes the possibility of choosing between the deamidation of nicotinamide or its direct incorporation into NAD. With large doses (1 mmole) of nicotinic acid the NAD level in the liver decreased, whereas NAD increased 2.5-fold during perfusion with nicotinamide (2 mmoles). Quinolinic acid was not a good precursor of NAD because of its limited uptake by the liver. During perfusion quinolinate transribosylase was released from the liver and catalyzed the decarboxylation of quinolinic acid as 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate became available."

https://openalex.org/W1527234155,"Abstract A variety of metabolites and chelating agents have been found to elicit a unique form of inhibition on an NAD-specific glutamate dehydrogenase from Blastocladiella emersonii. When measuring the initial rate of the reaction, the oxidative deamination of glutamate was completely inhibited by the metabolites citrate, isocitrate, fructose 1,6-diphosphate, and fumarate and by the nonmetabolites ATP and ethylenediaminetetraacetate. (ATP may be regarded as a metabolite in some reactions involving its transformation to ADP and AMP.) The rate of the reductive amination of α-ketoglutarate reaction was not affected by any of the inhibitors except ATP. The phenomenon of unidirectional inhibition in these initial velocity studies does not consider the microscopic reversibility of the reaction. Divalent cations, AMP, and ADP reversed this inhibition. AMP and ADP, in addition, served as allosteric effectors of this enzyme, activating the reaction in both directions of assay. ATP, on the other hand, participated as a negative allosteric effector. The inhibitory effects of the metabolites and EDTA were dependent on pH. All of the metabolic inhibitors are important intermediates which are involved in the production of energy in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and in glycolysis. A scheme that incorporates these findings into a regulatory network connecting glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle is formulated."
https://openalex.org/W2006723156,"In isolated thyroid cells I-epinephrine (0.1 and 10.0 micrograms per milliliter), norepinephrine and isoproterenol consistently stimulated the accumulation and organic binding of iodine. The effect was partially inhibited by phentolamine, but not propranolol, and hence may be mediated by alpha receptors. Theophylline did not mimic or enhance the epinephrine effect, suggesting that the latter may not result from activation of adenyl cyclase."

As calculated from hydrodynamic measurements, the active enzyme has a molecular weight of 104,000 and appears to be composed of four subunits, each of which has a molecular weight of approximately 26,000. The enzyme catalyzes the reversible reduction of tartronic semialdehyde to d-glycerate in the presence of DPNH or TPNH. Glyoxylate and lactate are not substrates. The equilibrium constant of 6 x 1011 has been calculated when DPNH formation is measured. The reaction is anion sensitive."

https://openalex.org/W1650943298,"Abstract It is clear from previous work that the oxygenated form of cytochrome oxidase is not a mixture of oxidized and reduced forms, and that the oxygenated form is spectrally indistinguishable from the hydrogen peroxide derivative of cytochrome oxidase, but that it can be obtained under conditions which preclude the generation of stoichiometric amounts of peroxide in the system. The present work shows that reduction of the oxygenated form by dithionite is faster and is kinetically distinguishable from the reduction of the oxidized form. On standing, the oxygenated form is unstable both with respect to the absorbance in the Soret region and the enzymic activity. Carbon monoxide causes an intensification and sharpening of the Soret peak. Regeneration of the oxidized form from the oxygenated form is accelerated by low oxygen concentrations, or by the addition of potassium ferricyanide, cupric sulfate, or ferricytochrome c. Almost immediate regeneration is produced by addition of a 3-fold molar excess of ferrocytochrome c. Regeneration of the oxidized form coincides with a cessation of destruction of the Soret peak and enzymic activity. The results are interpreted to indicate that in the absence of ferrocytochrome c, reduced cytochrome oxidase has an insufficient supply of electrons to reduce oxygen to water rapidly. However, the turnover between oxygenated and oxidized cytochrome oxidase, even in the presence of cytochrome c, is apparently too slow to account for the normal action of the enzyme."
