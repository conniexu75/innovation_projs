https://openalex.org/W4297991272,"Multi-marker metabarcoding is increasingly being used to generate biodiversity information across different domains of life from microbes to fungi to animals such as for molecular ecology and biomonitoring applications in different sectors from academic research to regulatory agencies and industry. Current popular bioinformatic pipelines support microbial and fungal marker analysis, while ad hoc methods are often used to process animal metabarcode markers from the same study. MetaWorks provides a harmonized processing environment, pipeline, and taxonomic assignment approach for demultiplexed Illumina reads for all biota using a wide range of metabarcoding markers such as 16S, ITS, and COI. A Conda environment is provided to quickly gather most of the programs and dependencies for the pipeline. Several workflows are provided such as: taxonomically assigning exact sequence variants, provides an option to generate operational taxonomic units, and facilitates single-read processing. Pipelines are automated using Snakemake to minimize user intervention and facilitate scalability. All pipelines use the RDP classifier to provide taxonomic assignments with confidence measures. We extend the functionality of the RDP classifier for taxonomically assigning 16S (bacteria), ITS (fungi), and 28S (fungi), to also support COI (eukaryotes), rbcL (eukaryotes, land plants, diatoms), 12S (fish, vertebrates), 18S (eukaryotes, diatoms) and ITS (fungi, plants). MetaWorks properly handles ITS by trimming flanking conserved rRNA gene regions as well as protein coding genes by providing two options for removing obvious pseudogenes. MetaWorks can be downloaded from https://github.com/terrimporter/MetaWorks and quickstart instructions, pipeline details, and a tutorial for new users can be found at https://terrimporter.github.io/MetaWorksSite ."
https://openalex.org/W4297983678,"The COVID-19 outbreak and governmental measures to keep the population safe had a great impact on many aspects of society, including well-being. Using data from N = 1281 participants from six countries (Argentina, France, Greece, Italy, Japan, and Turkey), we first explored differences in anxiety, depression (measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HADS), and time perspectives (Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory; ZTPI), between these countries during the first weeks of the pandemic. We observed that Turkish participants reported the highest levels of anxiety, and Japanese and Greek the lowest. For depression symptoms, the Japanese scored highest and Italians lowest. Next, for each country, we investigated how well the relatively time-stable personality traits of time perspectives, chronotype (reduced Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire; rMEQ), and Big Five personality traits (short Big Five Inventory; BFI) predicted the levels of anxiety and depression (HADS). The regression analyses showed that negative attitudes towards the past predicted the levels of both anxiety and depression in most of the countries we analyzed. Additionally, in many countries, a Past Positive orientation negatively predicted depression whereas the Present Fatalistic subscale predicted anxiety and depression. The chronotype did not contribute additionally to the models. The Big Five traits (and particularly neuroticism) showed substantial incremental explanatory power for anxiety in some countries but did not consistently predict anxiety levels. For depression, the additional variance accounted for by including the BFI as predictors was rather small. Importantly, the ZTPI subscales were retained as significant predictors in the model still when the BFI and rMEQ were considered as potential predictors. Our results yield evidence that the ZTPI time perspectives are valuable predictors for anxiety and depression levels during the first period of the pandemic."

This study aimed to assess the effect of telemedicine management of diabetes in obese and overweight young and middle-aged patients with T2DM during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A single-center randomized control study was conducted in 120 obese or overweight (body mass index [BMI] ≥ 24 kg/m 2 ) young and middle-aged patients (aged 18–55 years) with T2DM. Patients were randomly assigned to the intervention (telemedicine) or control (conventional outpatient clinic appointment) group. After baseline assessment, they were home isolated for 21 days, received diet and exercise guidance, underwent glucose monitoring, and followed up for 6 months. Glucose monitoring and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) scores were evaluated at 22 days and at the end of 3 and 6 months. Results Ninety-nine patients completed the 6-month follow-up (intervention group: n = 52; control group: n = 47). On day 22, the fasting blood glucose (FBG) level of the intervention group was lower than that of the control group (p &lt; 0.05), and the control group’s SDS increased significantly compared with the baseline value (p &lt; 0.05). At the end of 3 months, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and FBG levels in the intervention group decreased significantly compared with those in the control group (p &lt; 0.01). At the end of 6 months, the intervention group showed a significant decrease in postprandial blood glucose, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels as well as waist-to-hip ratio compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.05); moreover, the intervention group showed lower SDS scores than the baseline value (p &lt; 0.05). Further, the intervention group showed a significant reduction in BMI compared with the control group at the end of 3 and 6 months (p &lt; 0.01). Conclusion Telemedicine is a beneficial strategy for achieving remotely supervised blood glucose regulation, weight loss, and depression relief in patients with T2DM.

https://openalex.org/W4297983684,"Background Lumbo-sacral transitional vertebrae (LSTV) are one of the most common congenital variances of the spine. They are associated with an increased frequency of degeneration in the cranial adjacent segment. Hypermobility and concomitant increased loads are discussed as a possible reason for segmental degeneration. We therefore examined the lumbar and segmental motion distribution in patients with LSTV with flexion-extension radiographs. Methods A retrospective study of 51 patients with osteochondrosis L5/S1 with flexion and extension radiographs was performed. Of these, 17 patients had LSTV and were matched 1:1 for age and sex with patients without LSTV out of the collective of the remaining 34 patients. The lumbar and segmental range of motion (RoM) by segmental lordosis angle and the segmental wedge angle were determined. Normal distribution of parameters was observed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov-test. Parametric data were compared by paired T-test. Non-parametric data were compared by Wilcoxon-rank-sum-test. Correlations were observed using Spearman’s Rank correlation coefficient. A p-value &lt;0.05 was stated as statistically significant. Results Patients with LSTV had mean age of 52.2±10.9, control group of 48.9±10.3. Both groups included 7 females and 10 males. Patients with LSTV presented with reduced RoM of the lumbar spine (LSTV 37.3°±19.2°, control 52.1°±20.5°, p = 0.065), however effects were statistically insignificant. LSTV significantly decreased segmental RoM in the transitional segment (LSTV 1.8°±2.7°, control 6.7°±6.0°, p = 0.003). Lumbar motion distribution differed significantly; while RoM was decreased in the transitional segment, (LSTV 5.7%, control 16.2%, p = 0.002), the distribution of lumbar motion to the cranial adjacent segment was increased (LSTV 30.7%, control 21.6%, p = 0.007). Conclusion Patients with LSTV show a reduced RoM in the transitional segment and a significantly increased motion distribution to the cranial adjacent segment in flexion-extension radiographs. The increased proportion of mobility in the cranial adjacent segment possibly explain the higher rates of degeneration within the segment."
https://openalex.org/W4297946094,"Green innovation has become the goal for promoting the transformation and upgrading heavy pollution industries in the context of high-quality development, and the key factor for the success of green innovation is increasing the green innovation efficiency of heavy pollution industries. To understand the current situation of China’s industrial innovation and get out of the dilemma, we use non-expected Slacks-based model (SBM) to measure green innovation efficiency in Chinese industry, Lasso regression to screen the influencing factors of heavy pollution industries, tobit regression to study the influence degree and direction of different influencing factors on green innovation efficiency of heavy pollution industry. The results show that: (1) The green innovation efficiency of the 16 heavily polluting industries studied in this paper is generally low; (2) Coordination, green and openness all have a positive impact on the green innovation efficiency of the industry. (3) A certain degree of government scientific research support is conducive to improving the efficiency of industrial green innovation and exceeding the limit will have a restraining effect on enterprise innovation. According to the results, we put forward the corresponding policy implications."
https://openalex.org/W4297946107,"Among smallholder maize farmers in Ethiopia (and similar areas in Africa), yield and stress tolerance traits in maize varieties are important. While high yields remain a major objective, breeding and seed system development programs are increasingly based on the recognition that farmers also have an interest in other agronomic and consumption traits. In this paper we illustrate these issues by measuring the trade-offs farmers may be willing to make for specific traits in the mid-altitude maize markets in Ethiopia. Based on Choice Experiments among 1499 respondents, we estimate the preference for a set of agronomic and consumption traits relative to yield. by capturing farmers' ""willingness to sacrifice yield"". The results suggest a significant willingness to sacrifice yield for drought tolerance among both male and female household members, but not for early maturity per se. There was also a high willingness to sacrifice yields for plant architecture traits like closed tip and lodging resistance among male participants, but not among females. Heterogeneity in responses according to gender, education and land area under maize cultivation suggests that market segmentation is necessary for seed system development to become more demand-led and inclusive. Final and realistic segmentation will depend on the commercial viability or social impact potential of each segment."
https://openalex.org/W4297984177,"Salinity is a major abiotic stress affecting cereal production. Thus, tritipyrum (x. Tritipyrum), a potential novel salt-tolerant cereal, was introduced as an appropriate alternative for cereal production. The purposes of this study were to evaluate agronomic traits, yield, and yield stability of eight primary tritipyrum lines, five promising triticale lines, and four bread wheat varieties and to screen a stable yielding line. The experiments were conducted in randomized complete block designs with three replicates in three locations during four growing seasons. Analysis of variance in each environment and Bartlett's test for the variance homogeneity of experimental errors were made. Subsequently, separate experiments were analyzed as a combined experiment. The stability of grain yield was analyzed according to Eberhart and Russell's regression method, environmental variance, Wrick's ecovalance, Shokla's stability variance, AMMI, and Tai methods. Genotype × environment interactions (GEI) and environments were significant for the agronomic traits. Stability analysis revealed that combined primary tritipyrum line (Ka/b)(Cr/b)-5 and triticale 4115, 4108, and M45 lines had good adaptability in all environments. The results of the AMMI3 model and pattern analysis showed that the new cereal, tritipyrum, had the most stable response in various environments. The tritipyrum line (Ka/b)(Cr/b)-5 had the best yield performance and general adaptability. Based on Tai's method, the contribution of spike number to the stability of grain yield over different environments was higher than that of other yield components. Also, tritipyrum lines demonstrated higher stability compared with wheat and triticale. Totally, M45 triticale and tritipyrum (Ka/b)(Cr/b)-5 lines were the most stable genotypes with high grain yield. Complementary agronomic experiments may then release a new grain crop of triticale and a new pasture line of combined primary tritipyrum for grain and forage. Moreover, the combined tritipyrum line can be used in bread wheat breeding programs for producing salt-tolerant wheat cultivars."
https://openalex.org/W4297990808,"Previous literature has shown that music preferences (and thus preferred musical features) differ depending on the listening context and reasons for listening (RL). Yet, to our knowledge no research has investigated how features of music that people dance or move to relate to particular RL. Consequently, in two online surveys, participants (N = 173) were asked to name songs they move to (“dance music”). Additionally, participants (N = 105) from Survey 1 provided RL for their selected songs. To investigate relationships between the two, we first extracted audio features from dance music using the Spotify API and compared those features with a baseline dataset that is considered to represent music in general. Analyses revealed that, compared to the baseline, the dance music dataset had significantly higher levels of energy, danceability, valence, and loudness, and lower speechiness, instrumentalness and acousticness. Second, to identify potential subgroups of dance music, a cluster analysis was performed on its Spotify audio features. Results of this cluster analysis suggested five subgroups of dance music with varying combinations of Spotify audio features: “fast-lyrical”, “sad-instrumental”, “soft-acoustic”, “sad-energy”, and “happy-energy”. Third, a factor analysis revealed three main RL categories: “achieving self-awareness”, “regulation of arousal and mood”, and “expression of social relatedness”. Finally, we identified variations in people’s RL ratings for each subgroup of dance music. This suggests that certain characteristics of dance music are more suitable for listeners’ particular RL, which shape their music preferences. Importantly, the highest-rated RL items for dance music belonged to the “regulation of mood and arousal” category. This might be interpreted as the main function of dance music. We hope that future research will elaborate on connections between musical qualities of dance music and particular music listening functions."
https://openalex.org/W4297991065,"Stillbirth and perinatal mortality issues continue to receive inadequate policy attention in Ghana despite government efforts maternal health care policy intervention over the years. The development has raised concerns as to whether Ghana can achieve the World Health Organization target of 12 per 1000 live births by the year 2030.In this study, we compared stillbirth and perinatal mortality between two groups of women who registered and benefitted from Ghana's 'free' maternal health care policy and those who did not. We further explored the contextual factors of utilization of maternal health care under the 'free' policy to find explanation to the quantitative findings.The study adopted a mixed method approach, first using two rounds of Ghana Demographic and Health Survey data sets, 2008 and 2014 as baseline and end line respectively. We constructed outcome variables of stillbirth and perinatal mortality from the under 5 mortality variables (n = 487). We then analyzed for association using multiple logistics regression and checked for sensitivity and over dispersion using Poisson and negative binomial regression models, while adjusting for confounding. We also conducted 23 in-depth interviews and 8 focus group discussions for doctors, midwives and pregnant women and analyzed the contents of the transcripts thematically with verbatim quotes.Stillbirth rate increased in 2014 by 2 per 1000 live births. On the other hand, perinatal mortality rate declined within the same period by 4 per 1000 live births. Newborns were 1.64 times more likely to be stillborn; aOR: 1.64; 95% [CI: 1.02, 2.65] and 2.04 times more likely to die before their 6th day of life; aOR: 2.04; 95% [CI: 1.28, 3.25] among the 'free' maternal health care policy group, compared to the no 'free' maternal health care policy group, and the differences were statistically significant, p< 0.041; p< 0.003, respectively. Routine medicines such as folic acid and multi-vitamins were intermittently in short supply forcing private purchase by pregnant women to augment their routine requirement. Also, pregnant women in labor took in local concoction as oxytocin, ostensibly to fast track the labor process and inadvertently leading to complications of uterine rapture thus, increasing the risk of stillbirths.Even though perinatal mortality rate declined overall in 2014, the proportion of stillbirth and perinatal death is declining slowly despite the 'free' policy intervention. Shortage of medicine commodities, inadequate monitoring of labor process coupled with pregnant women intake of traditional herbs, perhaps explains the current rate of stillbirth and perinatal death."
https://openalex.org/W4297991381,"Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease accompanied by heterogenous clinical and histological features, including a characteristic keratinocyte hyperproliferation and dermal immunogenic profile. In addition, psoriasis is associated with widespread transcriptomic alterations including changes in microRNA (miRNA) and circular RNA (circRNA) abundance, which constitute non-coding RNA (ncRNA) classes with specific regulatory capacities in diverse physiological and pathological processes. However, the knowledge about the expression dynamics of ncRNA during psoriasis treatment is sparse. To elucidate the dynamics of miRNA and circRNA abundance during secukinumab (anti-IL-17A) treatment, we studied their expression patterns in skin biopsies from 14 patients with severe plaque-type psoriasis before and during an 84-day secukinumab therapy at day 0, 4, 14, 42, and 84 using NanoString nCounter technology. We found a comprehensive downregulation of the majority of investigated circRNAs and specific alterations in the miRNA profile, including an upregulation of miR-203a-3p, miR-93-5p, and miR-378i in lesional compared to non-lesional skin before treatment. During treatment, the circRNAs progressively returned to the expression levels observed in non-lesional skin and already four days after treatment initiation most circRNAs were significantly upregulated. In comparison, for miRNAs, the normalization to baseline during treatment was delayed and limited to a subset of miRNAs. Moreover, we observed a strong correlation between multiple circRNAs, including ciRS-7 and circPTPRA, and the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI). Similar pronounced correlations could, however, not be found for miRNAs. Finally, we did not observe any significant changes in circRNA expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells during treatment. In conclusion, we uncovered a rapid shift in global circRNA abundance upon anti-IL-17A treatment, which predated clinical and histological improvements, and a strong correlation with PASI, indicating a biomarker potential of individual circRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W4297983718,"Introduction Women engaged in sex work (WESW) have an elevated risk of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and sexually transmitted infections (STI). Estimates are three times higher than the general population. Understanding the predictors of HIV and STI among WESW is crucial in developing more focused HIV and STI prevention interventions among this population. The study examined the prevalence and predictors of HIV and STI among WESW in the Southern part of Uganda. Methodology Baseline data from the Kyaterekera study involving 542 WESW (ages 18–55) recruited from 19 HIV hotspots in the greater Masaka region in Uganda was utilized. HIV and STI prevalence was estimated using blood and vaginal fluid samples bioassay. Hierarchical regression models were used to determine the predictors of HIV and STI among WESW. Results Of the total sample, 41% (n = 220) were found to be HIV positive; and 10.5% (n = 57) tested positive for at least one of the three STI (Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis) regardless of their HIV status. Older age (b = 0.09, 95%CI = 0.06, 0.13, p≤0.001), lower levels of education (b = -0.79, 95%CI = -1.46, -0.11, p≤0.05), fewer numbers of children in the household (b = -0.18, 95%CI = -0.36, -0.01), p≤0.05), location (i.e., fishing village (b = 0.51, 95%CI = 0.16, 0.85, p≤0.01) or small town (b = -0.60, 95%CI = -0.92, -0.28, p≤0.001)), drug use (b = 0.58, 95%CI = 0.076, 1.08, p≤0.05) and financial self-efficacy (b = 0.05, 95%CI = -0.10, 0.00, p≤0.05), were associated with the risk of HIV infections among WESW. Domestic violence attitudes (b = -0.24, 95%CI = -0.42, -0.07, p≤0.01) and financial distress (b = -0.07, 95%CI = -0.14, -0.004, p≤0.05) were associated with the risk of STI infection among WESW. Conclusion Study findings show a high prevalence of HIV among WESW compared to the general women population. Individual and family level, behavioural and economic factors were associated with increased HIV and STI infection among WESW. Therefore, there is a need for WESW focused HIV and STI risk reduction and economic empowerment interventions to reduce these burdens."
https://openalex.org/W4297984044,"Attitudes toward aggression is a controversial phenomenon in psychiatry. This study examined and compared attitudes toward patient aggression in psychiatric hospitals from the perspectives of nurses, patients and informal caregivers and identified factors associated to these attitudes. A total of 2,424 participants completed a self-reported instrument regarding attitudes toward aggression (12-items Perception of Aggression Scale; POAS-S). We analysed data from nurses (n = 782), patients (n = 886), and informal caregivers (n = 765). Pearson’s r correlations were used to examine associations between variables. Differences between group scores were analysed using ANOVA/MANOVA with post-hoc Sheffe tests. Multivariate logistic regression models and logistic regression analysis were used to examine the effects of respondents’ characteristics on their attitudes toward aggression. Nurses had significantly more negative and less tolerant perceptions toward aggression (mean [SD] 47.1 [7.5], p&lt;0.001) than the patients (mean [SD] 44.4 [8.2]) and the informal caregivers (mean [SD] 45.0 [6.9), according to the POAS-S total scores. The same trend was found with the dysfunction and function sub-scores (mean [SD] 25.3 [4.1] and 15.0 [3.6], respectively); the differences between the groups were statistically significant (p &lt;0.001) when nurses’ scores were compared to those of both the patients (mean [SD] 23.7 [5.3] and 14.0 [4.1], respectively) and the informal caregivers (mean [SD] 24.4 [4.2] and 13.9 [3.5], respectively). The study offers new understanding of aggressive behavior in different treatment settings where attitudes toward patient behavior raises ethical and practical dilemmas. These results indicate a need for more targeted on-the-job training for nursing staff, aggression management rehabilitation programs for patients, and peer-support programs for informal caregivers focused on patient aggression."
https://openalex.org/W4297984158,"Background Ethiopia has low malaria prevalence compared to most other malaria-endemic countries in Africa. However, malaria is still a major public health problem in the country. The binary logistic regression model has been widely used to analyse malaria indicator survey (MIS) data. However, most MIS have a hierarchical structure which may result in dependent data. Since this model assumes that conditional on the covariates the malaria statuses of individuals are independent, it ignores potential intra-cluster correlation among observations within a cluster and may generate biased analysis results and conclusions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to quantify the variation in the prevalence of malaria between sample enumeration areas (SEAs) or clusters, the effects of cluster characteristics on the prevalence of malaria using the intra-class correlation coefficient as well as to identify significant factors that affect the prevalence of malaria using the multilevel logistic regression modelling in three major regions of Ethiopia, namely Amhara, Oromia and Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples’ (SNNP). Methods Dataset for three regional states extracted from the 2011 Ethiopian National Malaria Indicator Surveys (EMIS) national representative samples was used in this study. It contains 9272 sample individuals selected from these regions. Various multilevel models with random sample SEA effects were applied taking into account the survey design weights. These weights are scaled to address unequal probabilities of selection within clusters. The spatial clustering of malaria prevalence was assessed applying Getis-Ord statistic to best linear unbiased prediction values of model random effects. Results About 53.82 and 28.72 per cents of the sampled households in the study regions had no mosquito net and sprayed at least once within the last 12 months, respectively. The results of this study indicate that age, gender, household had mosquito nets, the dwelling has windows, source of drinking water, the two SEA-level variables, i.e. region and median altitude, were significantly related to the prevalence of malaria. After adjusting for these seven variables, about 45% of the residual variation in the prevalence of malaria in the study regions was due to systematic differences between SEAs, while the remaining 55% was due to unmeasured differences between persons or households. The estimated MOR, i.e. the unexplained SEA heterogeneity, was 4.784. This result suggests that there is high variation between SEAs in the prevalence of malaria. In addition, the 80% interval odds ratios (IORs) related to SEA-level variables contain one suggesting that the SEA variability is large in comparison with the effect of each of the variable. Conclusions The multilevel logistic regression with random effects model used in this paper identified five individual / household and two SEA-level risk factors of malaria infection. Therefore, the public health policy makers should pay attentions to those significant factors, such as improving the availability of pure drinking water. Further, the findings of spatial clustering provide information to health policymakers to plan geographically targeted interventions to control malaria transmission."
https://openalex.org/W4297984304,"The co-existence of undernutrition and overnutrition is a global public health threat. We aim to report the burden of both nutritional deficiency (Protein-Energy Malnutrition) and overweight (high Body Mass Index) in Nepal over a decade (2010-2019) and observe the changes through trend charts.We did a secondary data analysis using the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)'s Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database to download age-standardized data on Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) and high Body Mass Index (BMI). We presented the trend of death, Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Years of Life Lost (YLL), and Years Lost due to Disability (YLD) of PEM and high BMI in Nepal from 2010 to 2019 and also compared data for 2019 among South Asian countries.Between 2010 and 2019, in Nepal, the Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) due to PEM were declining while high BMI was in increasing trend. Sex-specific trends revealed that females had higher DALYs for PEM than males. In contrast, males had higher DALYs for high BMI than females. In 2019, Nepal had the highest death rate for PEM (5.22 per 100,000 populations) than any other South Asian country. The burden of PEM in terms of DALY was higher in under-five children (912 per 100,000 populations) and elderly above 80 years old (808.9 per 100,000 populations), while the population aged 65-69 years had the highest burden of high BMI (5893 per 100,000 populations). In the last decade, the DALYs for risk factors contributing to PEM such as child growth failure (stunting and wasting), unsafe water, sanitation and handwashing, and sub-optimal breastfeeding have declined in Nepal. On the contrary, the DALYs for risk factors contributing to high BMI, such as a diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages, a diet high in trans fatty acid, and low physical activity, have increased. This could be a possible explanation for the increasing trend of high BMI and decreasing trend of PEM.Rapidly growing prevalence of high BMI and the persistent existence of undernutrition indicate the double burden of malnutrition in Nepal. Public health initiatives should be planned to address this problem."
https://openalex.org/W4297990394,"We hypothesized that a drug's clinical signature (or phenotype) of liver injury can be assessed and used to quantitatively develop a computer-assisted DILI causality assessment-tool (DILI-CAT). Therefore, we evaluated drug-specific DILI-phenotypes for amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMX/CLA), cefazolin, cyproterone, and Polygonum multiflorum using data from published case series, to develop DILI-CAT scores for each drug.Drug specific phenotypes were made up of the following three clinical features: (1) latency, (2) R-value, and (3) AST/ALT ratio. A point allocation system was developed with points allocated depending on the variance from the norm (or ""core"") for the 3 variables in published datasets.The four drugs had significantly different phenotypes based on latency, R-value, and AST/ALT ratio. The median cyproterone latency was 150 days versus < 43 days for the other three drugs (median: 26 for AMX/CLA, 20 for cefazolin, and 20 for Polygonum multiflorum; p<0.001). The R-value for the four drugs was also significantly different among drugs (cyproterone [median 12.4] and Polygonum multiflorum [median 10.9]) from AMX/CLA [median 1.44] and cefazolin [median 1.57; p<0.001]). DILI-CAT scores effectively separated cyproterone and Polygonum multiflorum from AMX/CLA and cefazolin, respectively (p<0.001). As expected, because of phenotypic overlap, AMX/CLA and cefazolin could not be well differentiated.DILI-CAT is a data-driven, diagnostic tool built to define drug-specific phenotypes for DILI adjudication. The data provide proof of principle that a drug-specific, data-driven causality assessment tool can be developed for different drugs and raise the possibility that such a process could enhance causality assessment methods."
https://openalex.org/W4297990526,"The aim of this study is to construct and validate “physical literacy self-assessment questionnaire” (PLAQ) for Chinese students in grades 3–6. This study uses qualitative and quantitative methods to construct evaluation indicators of PL and determine the weights of each indicator. The 60 items of original PLAQ was based on literature review and interviews, and administered to 1179 primary students graded 3–6 in China. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) are used to optimize the structure and verify the reliability and validity of the questionnaire. The model of PLAQ is composed of 4 first-level indicators, 10 second-level indicators and 35 third-level indicators. The results of EFA and CFA resulted in a 44-items, 4-factor questionnaire. EFA item loadings ranged from 0.558 to 0.896, and Cronbach’s alpha ranged from 0.818 to 0.892. The results of CFA show that the constructed model fits well, and PLAQ has good convergent validity and discriminative validity. The PLAQ appeared to be reliable and valid that can be used as an assessment tool for students in grades 3–6. PLAQ can be used as a guide for the development of PL. Additionally, PLAQ gives us a shared understanding about what PL is and how it can be developed by Chinese children. However, studies on the accuracy and generalizability of the PLAQ should be conducted to improve it in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4297990768,"Scientific evidence to support the development of appropriate policy for electronic cigarette use is limited by rapidly changing technology and a lack of long-term data. Perceptions of risk and benefits determine diverse framings of the e-cigarette debate and complicate policy decisions. E-cigarette use by smokers who are attempting to quit may result in improved health outcomes, while their use among young people and non-smokers may lead to adverse health consequences. The purpose of this study was to identify the types of evidence used during public consultations on proposed revisions to New Zealand's e-cigarette legislation in 2020.Using submissions to parliament made by the tobacco/e-cigarette industry and the health sector, we assessed the cited evidence for quality and independence measured by publication type and tobacco industry connections. We identified themes from a sub-sample of frequently cited evidence to understand how stakeholders and organisations used evidence.The sample consisted of 57 submissions from the e-cigarette and tobacco industry (n = 21) and health organisations (n = 36). A total of 442 pieces of evidence were cited at least once. Health organisations were more likely to cite peer-reviewed evidence (OR = 2.99). The industry was more likely to cite evidence outside of peer review and sources with tobacco industry connections (OR = 4.08). In the sample of frequently cited evidence, youth prevalence and flavours were the most common themes. In some cases the same evidence was used by both groups to support opposing policy positions.The industry continues to rely more heavily on evidence published outside of the peer-review process, which is, therefore, subjected to less scientific scrutiny. By using a smoking-cessation or harm-reduction narrative, the industry could be seen as a legitimate stakeholder in policy development."

Several studies were conducted in Ethiopia to assess early neonatal death; however, most of the studies had limited participants and did not well address the two main determinant factors covered in this study. In response to this gap, this study attempted to examine factors related to early neonatal death based on perinatal death surveillance data in consideration of all the possible determinants of early neonatal death.The national perinatal death surveillance data were used for this study. A total of 3814 reviewed perinatal deaths were included in the study. Bayesian multilevel parametric survival analysis was employed to identify factors affecting the survival of newborns during the early neonatal period. Adjusted time ratio (ATR) with 95% Bayesian credible intervals (CrI) was reported and log-likelihood was used for model comparison. Statistical significance was declared based on the non-inclusion of 1.0 in the 95% CrI.More than half (52.4%) of early neonatal deaths occurred within the first two days of birth. Per the final model, as gestational age increases by a week the risk of dying during the early neonatal period is reduced by 6% [ATR = 0.94,95%CrI:(0.93-0.96)]. There was an increased risk of death during the early neonatal period among neonates deceased due to birth injury as compared to neonates who died due to infection [ATR = 2.05,95%CrI:(1.30-3.32)]; however, perinates who died due to complication of an intrapartum event had a lower risk of death than perinates who died due to infection [ATR = 0.87,95%CrI:(0.83-0.90)]. As the score of delay one and delay three increases by one unit, the newborn's likelihood of surviving during the early neonatal period is reduced by 4% [ATR = 1.04,95%CrI:(1.01-1.07)] and 21% [ATR = 1.21,95%CrI:(1.15-1.27)] respectively. Neonates born from mothers living in a rural area had a higher risk of dying during the early neonatal period than their counterparts living in an urban area [ATR = 3.53,95%CrI:(3.34-3.69)]. As compared to neonates treated in a primary health facility, being treated in secondary [ATR = 1.14,95%CrI:(1.02-1.27)] and tertiary level of care [ATR = 1.15,95%CrI:(1.04-1.25)] results in a higher risk of death during the early neonatal period.The survival of a newborn during the early neonatal period is determined by both individual (gestational age, cause of death, and delay one) and facility (residence, type of health facility and delay three) level factors. Thus, to have a positive early neonatal outcome, a tailored intervention is needed for the three major causes of death (i.e Infection, birth injury, and complications of the intrapartum period). Furthermore, promoting maternal health, improving the health-seeking behaviour of mothers, strengthening facility readiness, and narrowing down inequalities in service provision are recommended to improve the newborn's outcomes during the early neonatal period."
https://openalex.org/W4297990838,"Use of insecticide treated nets (ITN), one of the most cost-effective malaria interventions contributes to malaria cases averted and reduction in child mortality. We explored the use of ITN in children under five (CU5) and children of school age to understand factors contributing to ITN use.A cross-sectional study analyzed 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey data. The outcome variable was CU5 or children of school age who slept under ITN the night before the survey. Independent variables include child sex, head of household's sex, place of residence, state, household owning radio and television, number of household members, wealth quintile, years since ITN was obtained and level of malaria endemicity. Multi-level logistic regression model was used to access factors associated with ITN use among children.In total, 32,087 CU5 and 54,692 children of school age were examined with 74.3% of CU5 and 57.8% of children of school age using ITN the night before the survey. While seven states had more than 80% of CU5 who used ITN, only one state had over 80% of school children who used ITN. ITN use in CU5 is associated with living in rural area (aOR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.26) and residing in meso endemic area (aOR = 3.1, 95% CI 2.89 to 3.54). While In children of school age, use of ITN was associated with female headed households (aOR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.19), meso (aOR = 3.17, 95% CI 2.89 to 3.47) and hyper (aOR = 14.9, 95% CI 12.99 to 17.07) endemic areas. Children residing in larger households were less likely to use ITN.This study demonstrated increased use of ITN in CU5 from poor households and children living in rural and malaria endemic areas. Findings provide some policy recommendations for increasing ITN use in school children."
https://openalex.org/W4297990878,"Bladder cancer is the tenth most common cancer in the United Kingdom. Currently, open radical cystectomy (ORC) is the gold standard. Due to the risk of complications and a 2.3-8% mortality rate1, there is growing interest in the use of robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC). The aim of this study is to perform a cost-utility analysis, comparing RARC to ORC for bladder cancer patients from the perspective of the National Health Service England.A three-stage decision tree: surgery, post-surgery transfusions and complications, in a 90-day time horizon, was produced to simulate possible pathways of patients. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated based on data derived from current literature. Multiple univariate sensitivity analysis was carried out to evaluate influences of varying costs of RARC and ORC on the ICER.The ICER for RARC compared to ORC resulted in £25,536/QALY. At the lower threshold of £20,000/QALY, RARC resulted in a negative NMB (£-4,843.32) and at the upper threshold of £30,000/QALY, a positive NMB (£624.61) compared to ORC. Threshold analysis showed that the intervention costs of £13,497 and £14,403 are met at the lower and upper threshold respectively. The univariate sensitivity analysis showed that the intervention costs of RARC or ORC, and the probabilities of complications, had the greatest impact on the ICER.As the resultant ICER did not fall below the £20,000/QALY threshold, our study did not provide a definitive recommendation for RARC for bladder cancer. Negative values for the NMB at the lower threshold indicated the intervention was not feasible from a cost perspective. At the upper threshold of £30,000/QALY, this situation was reversed. The intervention became cost-effective. Therefore, further research is needed to justify the intervention."
https://openalex.org/W4297991087,"Introduction In resource-limited settings incorporating the Telemedicine system into the healthcare system enhances exchanging valid health information for practicing evidence-based medicine for the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. Despite its great importance, the adoption of telemedicine in low-income country settings, like Ethiopia, was lagging and increasingly failed. Assessing the readiness of health professionals before the actual adoption of telemedicine is considered the prominent solution to tackle the problem. However, little is known about Health professionals’ telemedicine readiness in this study setting. Objective Accordingly, this study aimed to assess health professionals’ readiness and its associated factors to implement a Telemedicine system at private hospitals in North West, Ethiopia. Materials and methods An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 3 to April 7, 2021. A total of 423 health professionals working in private hospitals were selected using a simple random sampling technique. Multi-variable logistic regression was fitted to identify determinant factors of health professional readiness after the other covariates were controlled. Result In this study the overall readiness of telemedicine adoption was 65.4% (n = 268) [95% CI:60.1–69.8]. Knowledge (AOR = 2.5;95% CI: [1.4, 4.6]), Attitude (AOR = 3.2;95% CI: [1.6, 6.2]), computer literacy (AOR = 2.2; 95% CI: [1.3, 3.9]), computer training (AOR = 2.1;95% CI: [1.1, 4.1]), Computer skill (AOR = 1.9;95% CI: [1.1, 3.4]), computer access at office (AOR = 2.1;95% CI: [1.1, 3.7]), Internet access at office (AOR = 2.8; 95% CI: [1.6, 5.1]), Own personal computer (AOR = 3.0; 95% CI: [1.5, 5.9]) and work experience (AOR = 3.1; 95% CI: [1.4, 6.7]) were significantly associated with the overall health professionals readiness for the adoption of telemedicine using a cut point of p-value lessthan 0.05. Conclusion and recommendation Around two-thirds of the respondents had a good level of overall readiness for the adoption of telemedicine. The finding implied that less effort is required to improve readiness before the implementation of telemedicine. This findings implied that respondents who had good knowledge and a favorable attitude toward telemedicine were more ready for such technology. Capacity building is needed Enhance computer literacy, and computer skills building their confidence to rise ready for such technology. Building their capacity through training, building good internet connection, and availability of computers, where the necessary measures to improve Telemedicine readiness in this setting. Additionally, further studies are recommended to encompass all types of telemedicine readiness such as organizational readiness, technology readiness, societal readiness, and so on. Additionally, exploring the healthcare provider opinion with qualitative study and extending the proposed study to other implementation settings are recommended to be addressed in future works. The study has a positive impact on the successful implementation and use of telemedicine throughout hospitals at countries level by providing pertinent information about health professionals’ preparedness status. Therefore, implementing telemedicine will have a significant contribution to the health system performance improvement in terms of providing quality care, accessibility to health facilities, reduction of costs, and creating a platform for communication between health professionals across different health institutions for providing quality patient care."
https://openalex.org/W4297991148,"Control charts are an amazing and essential statistical process control (SPC) instrument that is commonly used in monitoring systems to detect a specific defect in the procedure. The mixed Tukey modified exponentially weighted moving average - moving average control chart (MMEM-TCC) with motivation detection ability for fewer shifts in the process mean under symmetric and non-symmetric distributions is proposed in this paper. Average run length (ARL), standard deviation of run length (SDRL), and median run length (MRL) were used as efficiency criteria in the Monte Carlo simulation, and their efficiency was compared to existing control charts. Furthermore, the expected ARL (EARL) is a method for evaluating the performance of control charts beyond a specific range of shift sizes. The distinguishing feature of the proposed chart is that it performs efficiently in detecting small to moderate shifts. There are applications for PM 2.5 and PM 10 data that demonstrate the performance of the proposed chart."
https://openalex.org/W4297991174,"Rural settlements in oasis are primary habitations, and their changes are related to natural environment and anthropogenic activities. The spatiotemporal variations of rural settlements in an oasis are significant in arid regions. In this study, Qipan Township (QPT) and Yamansu Township (YMST) were chosen as a case study and validation case, respectively. Datasets, including Landsat images in 2002, 2010, and 2018, were collected. The cellular automata (CA)-agent-based model (ABM) and patch-generating land use simulation (PLUS) model were used to simulate the spatiotemporal dynamic variations of rural settlement and other land use types in the oasis in this study. Natural environmental, socioeconomic conditions, and human decision-making are the three driving factors that were used in the model. Human decision-making involves the actions of two types of agents: authority agent and resident agent. On the basis of land use data of 2002 and 2010, the rural settlement and other land use in 2018 were predicted using the CA-MAS and PLUS models. The following results were obtained: First, human decision-making behaviors were the leading factor in the changes of rural settlements in the CA-ABM model. Second, CA based on multiple random seed (CARS) of PLUS could better simulate the spatiotemporal variations of QPT rural settlements than CA-ABM and linear regression of PLUS. Similarly, CARS of PLUS also simulated the spatiotemporal evolution of rural settlements in YMST with high accuracy. Third, the areas of croplands, roads, and residential lands in QPT will expand to 20.7, 5.7, and 4.6 km2, respectively, in 2026, but the unused land will shrink, as predicted by CARS of PLUS. This study provides a scientific basis for the environmental protection of rural settlements in the oasis and sustainable settlement planning in arid regions."
https://openalex.org/W4297991246,"Predicting the export price of shrimp is important for Vietnam's fisheries. It not only promotes product quality but also helps policy makers determine strategies to develop the national shrimp industry. Competition in global markets is considered to be an important factor, one that significantly influences price. In this study, we predicted trends in the export price of Vietnamese shrimp based on competitive information from six leading exporters (China, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Ecuador, and Chile) who, alongside Vietnam, also export shrimp to the US. The prediction was based on a dataset collected from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and the World Trade Organization (WTO) (May-1995 to May-2019) that included price, required farming certificates, and disease outbreak data. A super learner technique, which combined 10 single algorithms, was used to make predictions in selected base periods (3, 6, 9, and 12 months). It was found that the super learner obtained results in all base periods that were more accurate and stable than any candidate algorithms. The impacts of variables in the predictive model were interpreted by a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to determine their influence on the price of Vietnamese exports. The price of Indian, Thai, and Chinese exports highlighted the advantages of being a World Trade Organization member and the disadvantages of the prevalence of shrimp disease in Vietnam, which has had a significant impact on the Vietnamese shrimp export price."
https://openalex.org/W4297946081,"Introduction Resistance training can induce skeletal muscle hypertrophy and strength gains, but is also associated with acute muscle damage, characterised by muscle soreness, impaired muscle function, and structural damage to muscle cell membranes and its components. These consequences can be detrimental to future exercise performance and dampen long-term training adaptations. Previous research has considered resistance exercise intensity as a factor in exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD), though a clear direction of the findings has not yet been established. Further, female populations are heavily underrepresented in this field of study. Therefore, we here propose a study protocol designed to examine sex differences in the muscle damage response to resistance exercise performed with low or high loads in a population of untrained, young adults. Methods This study will employ a randomised parallel group design. Twenty-four males and 24 females will perform an acute leg-based resistance exercise session at either 30% (low-load) or 80% (high-load) of their pre-determined one-repetition maximum (1RM). Maximal leg strength will be determined by a 1RM test 3 wk before and 72 and 168 h after the exercise bout. Additionally, muscle damage will be assessed immediately before the exercise bout and immediately, 24, 48, 72, and 168 h after the exercise bout through measures of muscle soreness, limb circumference, range of motion, and serum concentrations of creatine kinase and interleukin-6. The outcomes of this trial could inform sex-specific resistance training recommendations and help bridge the sex data gap in sport and exercise science research."
https://openalex.org/W4297946188,"The acquisition of sensory information about the world is a dynamic and interactive experience, yet the majority of sensory research focuses on perception without action and is conducted with participants who are passive observers with very limited control over their environment. This approach allows for highly controlled, repeatable experiments and has led to major advances in our understanding of basic sensory processing. Typical human perceptual experiences, however, are far more complex than conventional action-perception experiments and often involve bi-directional interactions between perception and action. Innovations in virtual reality (VR) technology offer an approach to close this notable disconnect between perceptual experiences and experiments. VR experiments can be conducted with a high level of empirical control while also allowing for movement and agency as well as controlled naturalistic environments. New VR technology also permits tracking of fine hand movements, allowing for seamless empirical integration of perception and action. Here, we used VR to assess how multisensory information and cognitive demands affect hand movements while reaching for virtual targets. First, we manipulated the visibility of the reaching hand to uncouple vision and proprioception in a task measuring accuracy while reaching toward a virtual target (n = 20, healthy young adults). The results, which as expected revealed multisensory facilitation, provided a rapid and a highly sensitive measure of isolated proprioceptive accuracy. In the second experiment, we presented the virtual target only briefly and showed that VR can be used as an efficient and robust measurement of spatial memory (n = 18, healthy young adults). Finally, to assess the feasibility of using VR to study perception and action in populations with physical disabilities, we showed that the results from the visual-proprioceptive task generalize to two patients with recent cerebellar stroke. Overall, we show that VR coupled with hand-tracking offers an efficient and adaptable way to study human perception and action."

While the binary result of an antigen test is sufficient for a clinical result, greater nuance can be gathered for malaria infection status based on quantitative and sensitive detection of Plasmodium antigens and machine learning analytical approaches.Three independent malaria studies performed in Angola and Haiti enrolled persons at health facilities and collected a blood sample. Presence and parasite density of P. falciparum infection was determined by microscopy for a study in Angola in 2015 (n = 193), by qRT-PCR for a 2016 study in Angola (n = 208), and by qPCR for a 2012-2013 Haiti study (n = 425). All samples also had bead-based detection and quantification of three Plasmodium antigens: pAldolase, pLDH, and HRP2. Decision trees and principal component analysis (PCA) were conducted in attempt to categorize P. falciparum parasitemia density status based on continuous antigen concentrations.Conditional inference trees were trained using the known P. falciparum infection status and corresponding antigen concentrations, and PCR infection status was predicted with accuracies ranging from 73-96%, while level of parasite density was predicted with accuracies ranging from 59-72%. Multiple decision nodes were created for both pAldolase and HRP2 antigens. For all datasets, dichotomous infectious status was more accurately predicted when compared to categorization of different levels of parasite densities. PCA was able to account for a high level of variance (>80%), and distinct clustering was found in both dichotomous and categorical infection status.This pilot study offers a proof-of-principle of the utility of machine learning approaches to assess P. falciparum infection status based on continuous concentrations of multiple Plasmodium antigens."
https://openalex.org/W4297984203,"The ideal Intracranial pressure (ICP) estimation method should be accurate, reliable, cost-effective, compact, and associated with minimal morbidity/mortality. To this end several described non-invasive methods in ICP estimation have yielded promising results, however the reliability of these techniques have yet to supersede invasive methods of ICP measurement. Over several publications, we described a novel imaging method of Modified Photoplethysmography in the evaluation of the retinal vascular pulse parameters decomposed in the Fourier domain, which enables computationally efficient information filtering of the retinal vascular pulse wave. We applied this method in a population of 21 subjects undergoing lumbar puncture manometry. A regression model was derived by applying an Extreme Gradient Boost (XGB) machine learning algorithm using retinal vascular pulse harmonic regression waveform amplitude (HRWa), first and second harmonic cosine and sine coefficients (an1,2, bn1,2) among other features. Gain and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) values ranked feature importance in the model. Agreement between the predicted ICP mean, median and peak density with measured ICP was assessed using Bland-Altman bias±standard error. Feature gain of intraocular pressure (IOPi) (arterial = 0.6092, venous = 0.5476), and of the Fourier coefficients, an1 (arterial = 0.1000, venous = 0.1024) ranked highest in the XGB model for both vascular systems. The arterial model SHAP values demonstrated the importance of the laterality of the tested eye (1.2477), which was less prominent in the venous model (0.8710). External validation was achieved using seven hold-out test cases, where the median venous predicted ICP showed better agreement with measured ICP. Although the Bland-Altman bias from the venous model (0.034±1.8013 cm water (p<0.99)) was lower compared to that of the arterial model (0.139±1.6545 cm water (p<0.94)), the arterial model provided a potential avenue for internal validation of the prediction. This approach can potentially be integrated into a neurological clinical decision algorithm to evaluate the indication for lumbar puncture."

The preferred therapeutic approach is cytoreductive surgery (CRS) accompanied by hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC); the role of systemic chemotherapy is not well established. While some limited retrospective studies report worse outcomes with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, our institution has favored the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for symptom relief and surgical optimization. The aim of our study was to assess the outcomes of patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, compared to those receiving adjuvant or no perioperative chemotherapy.We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study of treatment-naïve, non-papillary DMPM patients seen at our institution between 1/1/2009 and 9/1/2019. We explored the effect of type of systemic therapy on clinical outcomes and estimated median overall survival (mOS) using Kaplan-Meier curves. Hazard ratios (HR) calculated by Cox proportional hazard model were used to estimate effect of the exposures on overall survival.47 patients were identified with DMPM (median age at diagnosis 61.2 years, 76.6% epithelioid histology, 74.5% white race, 55.3% known asbestos exposure). CRS was performed in 53.2% of patients (25/47); 76.0% of surgical patients received HIPEC (19/25). The majority received systemic chemotherapy (37/47, 78.7%); among patients receiving both CRS and chemotherapy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was more common than adjuvant chemotherapy (12 neoadjuvant, 8 adjuvant). Overall mOS was 84.1 months. Among neoadjuvant patients, 10/12 underwent surgery, and 2 were lost to follow-up; the majority (9/10) had clinically stable or improved disease during the pre-operative period. There were numerical more issues with chemotherapy with the adjuvant patients (4/8: 2 switches in platinum agent, 2 patients stopped therapy) than with the neoadjuvant patients (2/10: 1 switch in platinum agent, 1 delay due to peri-procedural symptoms). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with worse mOS compared to adjuvant chemotherapy (mOS NR vs 95.1 mo, HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.18-4.5, p = 0.89).When used preferentially, the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in DMPM patients was not associated with worse outcomes compared to adjuvant chemotherapy. It was well-tolerated and did not prevent surgical intervention."
https://openalex.org/W4297990942,"Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is a rare disease characterized by increased ventricular stiffness and preserved ventricular contraction. Various sarcomere gene variants are known to cause RCM; however, more than a half of patients do not harbor such pathogenic variants. We recently demonstrated that cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) play important roles in inhibiting the diastolic function of cardiomyocytes via humoral factors and direct cell-cell contact regardless of sarcomere gene mutations. However, the mechanical properties of CFs that are crucial for intercellular communication and the cardiomyocyte microenvironment remain less understood. In this study, we evaluated the rheological properties of CFs derived from pediatric patients with RCM and healthy control CFs via atomic force microscopy. Then, we estimated the cellular modulus scale factor related to the cell stiffness, fluidity, and Newtonian viscosity of single cells based on the single power-law rheology model and analyzed the comprehensive gene expression profiles via RNA-sequencing. RCM-derived CFs showed significantly higher stiffness and viscosity and lower fluidity compared to healthy control CFs. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing revealed that the signaling pathways associated with cytoskeleton elements were affected in RCM CFs; specifically, cytoskeletal actin-associated genes (ACTN1, ACTA2, and PALLD) were highly expressed in RCM CFs, whereas several tubulin genes (TUBB3, TUBB, TUBA1C, and TUBA1B) were down-regulated. These results implies that the signaling pathways associated with cytoskeletal elements alter the rheological properties of RCM CFs, particularly those related to CF-cardiomyocyte interactions, thereby leading to diastolic cardiac dysfunction in RCM."

In the present study, we investigated the relationship between a simple sensory evaluation of anti-slipperiness by foot rubbing in standing and sitting positions and the actual friction properties obtained with in situ measurements at slip onset and during sliding. We also verified the possibility of identifying a hazardous area with a high slip-induced fall risk by the sensory evaluation scores. At the foot rubbing tests, more than half of the 15 participants in experiments could adequately perceive the slip resistance using the proposed method without any education on its perception. Furthermore, hazard detection scores, where a friction coefficient of 0.2 was detected as hazardous area, were obtained from optimal cut-off points of receiver operatorating characteristic curves for the participants with friction perception capability. The scores were 28.7, 20.7, 24.7, and 52.3/100 for the slip onset while standing, sliding while standing, slip onset while sitting, and sliding while sitting, respectively. From the viewpoint of hazard detection accuracies, the standing position was a better way than the sitting although limited to participants with the capability of perceiving friction. Based on the analysis of how to apply forces, the participants who showed a small movement of the center of pressure while standing or an increase in the vertical load while sitting had the capability of perceiving friction."

Methods 476 older adults (61% Female; 71 ± 5 years) with no history of myocardial infarction, stroke, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, or diabetes were included in this cross-sectional study. Diverticulitis cases were identified by self-reported physician diagnosis from the medical history questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the prevalence of diverticulitis by tertiles of CRF and BMI category. CRF and BMI were further dichotomized into either “unfit” (the lowest one-third of CRF), “fit” (the upper two-thirds of CRF), “overweight/obese” (BMI ≥25.0 kg/m 2 ), or “normal-weight” (BMI &lt;25.0 kg/m 2 ) to investigate the joint association of CRF and BMI with diverticulitis. Results Thirty-five (7.4%) participants were identified as having diverticulitis. Compared with the lowest CRF tertile, the ORs (95% CIs) of diverticulitis were 0.52 (0.22–1.22) and 0.33 (0.12–0.94) in the middle and upper CRF tertiles, respectively, after adjusting for potential confounders. After further adjustment for BMI, the association was no longer significant with ORs (95% CIs) of 0.55 (0.23–1.33) and 0.37 (0.12–1.10) in middle and upper CRF tertiles, respectively. Compared with the normal-weight group, the ORs (95% CIs) of diverticulitis were 2.86 (1.05–7.79) and 2.98 (0.95–9.35) in the overweight and obese groups, respectively, after adjusting for possible confounders and CRF. Compared with the “unfit and overweight/obese” group in the joint analysis, the OR (95% CI) of diverticulitis was 0.16 (0.04–0.61) in the “fit and normal-weight” group. Conclusions Older adults who maintain higher CRF and lower BMI may have significantly lower odds of diverticulitis, with the lowest odds found in the normal-weight and fit older adults."
https://openalex.org/W4297991011,"Personal care products are increasingly being marketed to protect skin from the potentially harmful effects of air pollution. Here, we experimentally measure ozone deposition rates to skin and the generation rates and yields of oxidized products from bare skin and skin coated with various lotion formulations. Lotions reduced the ozone flux to the skin surface by 12% to 25%; this may be due to dilution of reactive skin lipids with inert lotion compounds or by reducing ozone diffusivity within the resulting mixture. The yields of volatile squalene oxidation products were 25% to 70% lower for a commercial sunscreen and for a base lotion with an added polymer or with antioxidants. Lower yields are likely due to competitive reactions of ozone with lotion ingredients including some ingredients that are not intended to be ozone sinks. The dynamics of the emissions of squalene ozonation product 6 methyl-2-heptenone (6MHO) suggest that lotions can dramatically reduce the solubility of products in the skin film. While some lotions appear to reduce the rate of oxidation of squalene by ozone, this evidence does not yet demonstrate that the lotions reduce the impact of air pollution on skin health."
https://openalex.org/W4297991041,"Parkinson’s disease is the second most common age-related, neurodegenerative disease. A small collection of genes has been linked to Parkinson’s disease including LRRK2 , SAT1 , and SNCA , the latter of which encodes the protein alpha-synuclein that aggregates in Lewy bodies as a hallmark of the disease. Overexpression of even wild-type versions of these genes can lead to pathogenesis, yet the regulatory mechanisms that control protein production of the genes are not fully understood. Pumilio proteins belong to the highly conserved PUF family of eukaryotic RNA-binding proteins that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression through binding conserved motifs in the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA targets known as PUF Recognition Elements (PREs). The 3’UTRs of LRRK2 , SNCA and SAT1 each contain multiple putative PREs. Knockdown (KD) of the two human Pumilio homologs (Pumilio 1 and Pumilio 2) in a neurodegenerative model cell line, SH-SY5Y, resulted in increased SNCA and LRRK2 mRNA, as well as alpha-synuclein levels, suggesting these genes are normally repressed by the Pumilio proteins. Some studies have indicated a relationship between Pumilio and microRNA activities on the same target, especially when their binding sites are close together. LRRK2 , SNCA , and SAT1 each contain several putative microRNA-binding sites within the 3’UTR, some of which reside near PREs. Small RNA-seq and microRNA qPCR assays were performed in both wild type and Pumilio KD SH-SY5Y cells to analyze global and differential microRNA expression. One thousand four hundred and four microRNAs were detected across wild type and Pumilio KD cells. Twenty-one microRNAs were differentially expressed between treatments, six of which were previously established to be altered in Parkinson’s disease patient samples or research models. Expression of ten miRs predicted to target LRRK2 and SNCA was verified by RT-qPCR. Collectively, our results demonstrate that Pumilios and microRNAs play a multi-faceted role in regulating Parkinson’s disease-associated genes."

We examined 43 skulls of adult Eurasian otters belonging to 18 sampling localities and three genetic clusters (Shetlands, Wales and Scotland). For each sample location, information regarding climate was described using bioclimatic variables from WorldClim, and information on otter diet was extracted from the literature. By using photogrammetry, 3D models were obtained for each skull. To explore any evidence of adaptive divergence within these areas we used a three dimensional geometric morphometric approach to test differences in skull size and shape between areas with genetically distinct populations, as well as the influence of diet, isolation by distance and climate. Males were significantly larger in skull size than females across all the three genetic clusters. Skull shape, but not size, appeared to differ significantly among genetic clusters, with otters from Shetland exhibiting wider zygomatic arches and longer snouts compared to otters from Wales, whereas otters from Scotland displayed intermediate traits. A significant relationship could also be found between skull shape variation, diet as well as climate. Specifically, otters feeding on freshwater fish had more slender and short-snouted skulls compared to otters feeding mostly on marine fish. Individuals living along the coast are characterised by a mixed feeding regime based on marine fish and crustaceans and their skull showed an intermediate shape. Coastal and island otters also had larger orbits and eyes more oriented toward the ground, a larger nasal cavity, and a larger distance between postorbital processes and zygomatic arch. These functional traits could also represent an adaptation to favour the duration and depth of diving, while the slender skull of freshwater feeding otters could improve the hydrodynamics."
https://openalex.org/W4297991060,"Non availability of effective anti-TB vaccine impedes TB control which remains a crucial global health issue. A fusion molecule based on immunogenic antigens specific to different growth phases of Mycobacterium tuberculosis can enhance T-cell responses required for developing a potent vaccine. In this study, six antigens including EspC, TB10.4, HspX, PPE57, CFP21 and Rv1352 were selected for constructing EspC-TB10.4 (bifu25), TnCFP21-Rv1352 (bifu29), HspX-EspC-TB10.4 (trifu37), HspX-TnCFP21-Rv1352 (trifu44) and HspX-EspC-TB10.4-PPE57 (tetrafu56) fusion proteins. Th1-cell epitopes of EspC, PPE57 and Rv1352 antigens were predicted for the first time using different in silico tools. The fusion molecule tetrafu56, which consisted of antigens from both the replicating and the dormant stages of Mtb , induced a release of 397 pg/mL of IFN-γ from PBMCs of the active TB patients. This response was comparable to the response obtained with cocktail of the component antigens (396 pg/mL) as well as to the total of the responses obtained separately for each of its component antigens (388 pg/mL). However, PBMCs from healthy samples in response to tetrafu56 showed IFN-γ release of only 26.0 pg/mL Thus a previous exposure of PBMCs to Mtb antigens in TB plasma samples resulted in 15-fold increase in IFN-γ response to tetrafu56 as compared to the PBMCs from the healthy controls. Hence, most of the T-cell epitopes of the individual antigens seem to be available for T-cell interactions in the form of the fusion. Further investigation in animal models should substantiate the immune efficacy of the fusion molecule. Thus, the fusion tetrafu56 seems to be a potential candidate for developing an effective multistage vaccine against TB."
https://openalex.org/W4297946074,"US service members injured in the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan were more likely to survive than those in previous conflicts because of advances in medicine and protective gear. However, there is limited research examining the long-term impact of injuries while deployed on physical and mental quality of life (QOL) among service members. We used data from two time-points with an average follow-up period of 4.27 years (SD = 2.13; n = 118,054) to prospectively examine the association between deployment and injury status with QOL. Data were derived from the Millennium Cohort Study surveys (2001 to 2016) and linked with the Department of Defense Trauma Registry (DoD-TR) among a cohort of US service members from all branches and components. The primary predictor (a combination of deployment and injury status) was comprised of the following four categories: 1) not deployed, 2) deployed and not injured, 3) deployed and non-battle injured, and 4) deployed and battle injured. Demographic, military, psychological and behavioral health, and life stress factors were adjusted for in multivariable models. Outcomes of interest were physical and mental QOL from the Short-Form Health Survey for Veterans (VR-36) measured at ~4 year follow-up. Between group comparisons indicated that those deployed and battle-injured had the greatest decline in both mental (-3.82) and physical (-10.13) QOL scores over time (p < .05). While deployment and injury status were associated with poorer mental and physical QOL in adjusted models; only the association between deployment and injury status with physical QOL was clinically meaningful (more than 2.5). In adjusted models, Time 1 mental and physical QOL explained most of the variance (23-25%) in Time 2 mental and physical health QOL as compared to other covariates (e.g., injury and deployment, and other sociodemographic factors increased variance by ~5%). Time 1 QOL was the most significant predictor of later QOL, but those injured while deployed experienced significant and meaningful decrements to long-term physical QOL. This suggests that prevention and rehabilitation interventions should focus on improving physical health among injured service members to avoid long-term adverse effects."
https://openalex.org/W4297946078,"Twin pregnancy carries a high risk of pregnancy-related complications including adverse perinatal outcomes. Although evidence from international studies indicated an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes in twin pregnancies, little is known about the adverse perinatal outcomes in twin pregnancies and associated factors in Ethiopia. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to estimate the incidence of twin pregnancies and related-adverse perinatal outcomes and identify factors associated with adverse perinatal outcomes in twin pregnancies in Ethiopia.A hospital-based retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted among 322 mothers who gave twin birth at Adama Hospital Medical College between 08 July 2015 and 07 June 2017. In this study, the adverse perinatal outcome was defined as the presence of any of the following main conditions: low birth weight, preterm birth, stillbirth, low Apgar Scores, mal-presentation, Admission to neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and early neonatal deaths. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.0. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to identify factors associated with adverse perinatal outcome at 95% CI or P-value of less than 0.05.Of 10,850 births recorded in the hospital, 354 births were twins and 322 of these paired records had complete perinatal information. One hundred ninety-nine (61.8%) of the 322 paired birth records had at least one adverse perinatal outcome on one or both twins. Low birth weight was the most common perinatal outcome followed by preterm birth. After adjusting for confounding factors, younger maternal age (AOR = 4.1, 95% CI; 1.3, 12.5) and not having ultrasound scan during antenatal care (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.2, 3.1) were significantly associated with adverse perinatal outcomes.The incidence of adverse perinatal outcome in twin pregnancies was high, that is, in 61.8% of twin births, there was at least one adverse perinatal outcome on one or both twins. Moreover, younger maternal age at birth and not having an ultrasound scan during antenatal care were found to be strong predictors for the observed high incidence of adverse perinatal outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4297983706,"Mask-wearing is the simplest yet most effective preventive behavior during COVID-19. However, it has sparked great controversy, particularly in America. Little is known about what psychosocial factors predict people’s decision to mask. This research challenges three myths about mask-wearing. First, does mask-wearing provide a false sense of security? Second, is knowledge of COVID-19 a more robust predictor than political ideology of mask-wearing behavior? Third, does resistance to masks reflect anti-authoritarianism or a lack of trust in government? With nationally representative samples across two cultures ( N = 1,121), findings reveal a significant positive correlation between mask-wearing and other preventive behaviors. Moreover, knowledge of COVID-19 and trust in government significantly predicted mask-wearing. Implications of the results are also discussed in the cross-cultural context. Critically, findings could provide practical implications for public education and policymaking by uncovering how to more effectively promote compliance with recommended preventive behaviors during our ongoing struggle with COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4297984196,"Introduction Risk analyses within rural regions of Nigeria are not routinely conducted, yet could help inform access to skilled birth care. The objective of this study was to assess and compare the proportion of pregnant women at risk for maternal mortality or morbidity in Benue State, Nigeria by analysing data collected during routine antenatal visits and through the Community Maternal Danger Score (CMDS), a validated risk-analysis tool. Methods Two cohorts, comprised of pregnant women presenting to primary healthcare centres within Gboko, Benue State between 2015–2017 and 2020–2021, were included in this study. The 2015–2017 cohort had their risk assessed retrospectively through analysis of routinely collected data. Identification of risk was based on their age, parity, and disease status (HIV and diabetes). The 2020–2021 cohort had their risk assessed prospectively using the CMDS. Results Routinely collected data from 2015–2017 demonstrated that up to 14.9% of women in Gboko were at risk for mortality or morbidity. The CMDS reported that up to 21.5% of women were at a similar level of risk; a significant difference of 6.6% (p = 0.006). The CMDS was more efficient in obtaining and assessing this data, and the identification of risk occurred in real-time. Conclusion Routine data collected in Gboko identifies a high proportion of pregnant women at risk for mortality or morbidity. The CMDS is an evidence-based risk analysis tool that expands on this assessment by also estimating individual and community-level risk, which allows for more efficient mitigation and prevention strategies of maternal mortality."
https://openalex.org/W4297990748,"During the Covid-19 pandemic, older people have been in the spotlight of the public debate. Given their higher risk of severe outcomes of the disease, they have been described as especially vulnerable and as a burden to others and society. We thus wanted to investigate how older people's perception of their own age, that is their subjective age, as well as their Covid-19 related risks and worries were related during the pandemic and whether these relationships varied according to participants' subjective health. We used data from the longitudinal CRISIS study which was conducted in the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg in June and October 2020. Participants were aged 60-98 and responded on questionnaires regarding their subjective age, worry of falling ill with Covid-19, perceived risk of contracting the virus, perceived risk of falling seriously ill if they contracted Covid-19, as well as their subjective health and covariates. Three cross-lagged panel models were constructed to explore the longitudinal, bidirectional relationships between the variables. Cross-sectionally, a higher subjective age was related to more perceived risk of a serious course of disease. Longitudinally, subjective age and worry did not show any significant association over time, and neither did subjective age and perceived risk of contracting the virus. However, subjective health significantly moderated the relationship of worry and subjective age, showing different trajectories in the relationship depending on whether subjective health was good or bad. Higher perceived risk of falling seriously ill increased subjective age over time. Again, subjective health moderated this relationship: the perceived risk of falling seriously ill affected subjective age only for those with better subjective health. Our findings show the interactive relationship between subjective age and Covid-19 related cognitions and emotions and provide guidance for identifying older people that are most susceptible for negative age-related communication during the pandemic."

https://openalex.org/W4297990979,"People prefer music with an intermediate level of predictability; not so predictable as to be boring, yet not so unpredictable that it ceases to be music. This sweet spot for predictability varies due to differences in the perception of predictability. The symptoms of both psychosis and Autism Spectrum Disorder have been attributed to overestimation of uncertainty, which predicts a preference for predictable stimuli and environments. In a pre-registered study, we tested this prediction by investigating whether psychotic and autistic traits were associated with a higher preference for predictability in music. Participants from the general population were presented with twenty-nine pre-composed music excerpts, scored on their complexity by musical experts. A participant's preferred level of predictability corresponded to the peak of the inverted U-shaped curve between music complexity and liking (i.e., a Wundt curve). We found that the sweet spot for predictability did indeed vary between individuals. Contrary to predictions, we did not find support for these variations being associated with autistic and psychotic traits. The findings are discussed in the context of the Wundt curve and the use of naturalistic stimuli. We also provide recommendations for further exploration."
https://openalex.org/W4297991075,"Several previous studies have evaluated the predictors of relapse in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis. Nonetheless, the association between renal-limited vasculitis and relapse has not been evaluated.To assess the association between renal-limited vasculitis and the incidence of relapse in Japan among patients with microscopic polyangiitis/renal-limited vasculitis.This retrospective cohort study included consecutive patients in remission at 6 months, with renal-limited vasculitis (n = 24, renal-limited vasculitis group) and microscopic polyangiitis with renal and extra-renal involvement (n = 56, non-renal-limited vasculitis group) between 2004 and 2020.During the median follow-up period of 35 (range, 15‒57) months, 28 (35.0%) patients had a relapse. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models revealed that the lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (per -10 mL/min/1.73 m2; adjusted hazard ratio = 0.87, 95% confidence interval: 0.76-0.99; P = 0.043), renal-limited vasculitis (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.23, 95% confidence interval: 0.08-0.68; P = 0.008), and glucocorticoid combined with intravenous cyclophosphamide or rituximab (adjusted HR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.11-0.96; P = 0.042) were associated with a decreased risk of relapse. Glucocorticoid dose during the observation period was lower in the renal-limited vasculitis group than in the non-renal-limited vasculitis group.Renal-limited vasculitis was associated with a lower risk of relapse than non-renal-limited vasculitis. Our data may contribute to the development of optimal management for renal-limited vasculitis, which may assist in minimizing the adverse effects of immunosuppressive therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4297991213,"Background Oxaliplatin causes acute cold-induced neurotoxicity and chronic cumulative neuropathy, which can require dose modification and impacts quality of life. However, effective strategies for managing oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OIPN) among affected patients remain elusive. Objective This retrospective study aimed to identify predictors for the development of OIPN. Methods Participants comprised 322 cancer patients at our hospital who were receiving oxaliplatin between January 2017 and March 2021. For the regression analysis of factors associated with OIPN, variables were manually extracted from medical charts. The severity of OIPN was evaluated using the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5. Multivariate ordered logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors for the development of OIPN. Optimal cut-off thresholds were determined using receiver operating characteristic analysis. Values of P &lt;0.05 (2-tailed) were considered significant. Results Significant risk factors identified included higher body mass index (BMI) (odds ratio [OR] = 1.06, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.00–1.12; P = 0.043), female sex (OR = 1.67, 95%CI = 1.06–2.61; P = 0.026) and higher total dosage (OR = 2.39, 95%CI = 1.67–3.42; P = &lt; 0.0001). Conclusion High BMI, female sex and high total dosage were identified as significant predictors for the development of OIPN."
https://openalex.org/W4297991273,"Despite the potential benefits of implicit measures over self-report measures, they are rarely used in real-world contexts to predict behavior. Two potential reasons are that (a) traditional implicit measures typically show low predictive validity and (b) the practical utility of implicit measures has hardly been investigated. The current studies test the practical utility of a new generation of implicit measures for predicting drunk driving. Study 1 ( N = 290) examined whether an implicit measure of beliefs about past drunk driving (i.e., the Past Driving Under the Influence Implicit Association Test; P-DUI-IAT) retrospectively predicts drunk driving in driving school students, a population for which this measure could have applied value. Study 1 also explored whether P-DUI-IAT scores prospectively predicted drunk driving over six months. Due to the low number of offenders, however, Study 1 had low statistical power to test this latter question. In Study 2 ( N = 228), we therefore examined the utility of the P-DUI-IAT and a new variant of this test (i.e., the Acceptability of Driving Under the Influence Implicit Association Test; A-DUI-IAT) to prospectively predict drunk driving in an online sample with a high number of offenders. Results from Study 1 show that the P-DUI-IAT predicts self-rated past drunk driving behavior in driving school students (ORs = 3.11–6.12, p s &lt; .043, 95% CIs = [1.11, 37.69]). Results from Study 1 do not show evidence for utility of the P-DUI-IAT to prospectively predict self-rated drunk driving. Results from Study 2, on the other hand, show strong evidence for the utility of both implicit measures to prospectively predict self-rated drunk driving (ORs = 3.80–5.82, p s &lt; .002, 95% CIs = [1.72, 14.47]). Although further applied research is necessary, the current results could provide a first step towards the application of implicit measures in real-world contexts."
https://openalex.org/W4297991337,"Human smooth pursuit eye movements and motion perception behave similarly when observers track and judge the motion of simple objects, such as dots. But moving objects in our natural environment are complex and contain internal motion. We ask how pursuit and perception integrate the motion of objects with motion that is internal to the object. Observers ( n = 20) tracked a moving random-dot kinematogram with their eyes and reported the object’s perceived direction. Objects moved horizontally with vertical shifts of 0, ±3, ±6, or ±9° and contained internal dots that were static or moved ±90° up/down. Results show that whereas pursuit direction was consistently biased in the direction of the internal dot motion, perceptual biases differed between observers. Interestingly, the perceptual bias was related to the magnitude of the pursuit bias ( r = 0.75): perceptual and pursuit biases were directionally aligned in observers that showed a large pursuit bias, but went in opposite directions in observers with a smaller pursuit bias. Dissociations between perception and pursuit might reflect different functional demands of the two systems. Pursuit integrates all available motion signals in order to maximize the ability to monitor and collect information from the whole scene. Perception needs to recognize and classify visual information, thus segregating the target from its context. Ambiguity in whether internal motion is part of the scene or contributes to object motion might have resulted in individual differences in perception. The perception-pursuit correlation suggests shared early-stage motion processing or perception-pursuit interactions."
https://openalex.org/W4297991347,"Despite many innovative ideas generated in response to COVID-19, few studies have examined community preferences for these ideas. Our study aimed to determine university community members' preferences for three novel ideas identified through a crowdsourcing open call at the University of North Carolina (UNC) for making campus safer in the pandemic, as compared to existing (i.e. pre-COVID-19) resources. An online survey was conducted from March 30, 2021 -May 6, 2021. Survey participants included UNC students, staff, faculty, and others. The online survey was distributed using UNC's mass email listserv and research directory, departmental listservs, and student text groups. Collected data included participant demographics, COVID-19 prevention behaviors, preferences for finalist ideas vs. existing resources in three domains (graduate student supports, campus tours, and online learning), and interest in volunteering with finalist teams. In total 437 survey responses were received from 228 (52%) staff, 119 (27%) students, 78 (18%) faculty, and 12 (3%) others. Most participants were older than age 30 years (309; 71%), women (332, 78%), and white (363, 83.1%). Five participants (1%) were gender minorities, 66 (15%) identified as racial/ethnic minorities, and 46 (10%) had a disability. Most participants preferred the finalist idea for a virtual campus tour of UNC's lesser-known history compared to the existing campus tour (52.2% vs. 16.0%). For graduate student supports, 41.4% of participants indicated no preference between the finalist idea and existing supports; for online learning resources, the existing resource was preferred compared to the finalist idea (41.6% vs. 30.4%). Most participants agreed that finalists' ideas would have a positive impact on campus safety during COVID-19 (81.2%, 79.6%, and 79.2% for finalist ideas 1, 2 and 3 respectively). 61 (14.1%) participants indicated interest in volunteering with finalist teams. Together these findings contribute to the development and implementation of community-engaged crowdsourced campus safety interventions during COVID-19."

The selection of patients, drug dosages, and dosing intervals in LDM is empirical. In this study, we systematically examined the schedule-dependent interaction of drugs on a breast cancer cell line (BCC) cultured in chambered coverslips. The LDM studies were combined with cell staining in order to better characterize different cell states and cell death modes, including caspase-dependent apoptosis, caspase-independent cell death and autophagy-dependent cell death. Microscope images were examined using the Fiji Trainable Weka Segmentation plugin to analyse cell area in 7500 images showing different modes of cell death. Paclitaxel combined with LDM chemotherapy demonstrated a reduction in the area covered by live cells. In contrast, there was an induction of high levels of cell death due to caspase-dependent apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W4297991421,"The burden of missed healthcare appointments is so great that even small reductions in Did Not Attend (DNA) rate can secure tangible benefits. Previous studies have identified demographic factors that predict DNA rate. However, it is not obvious that these insights can be used to improve attendance, as healthcare providers do not control patient demographics. One factor that providers do control is appointment scheduling. We previously reported that appointments at the beginning of the week are more likely to be missed than appointments at the end of the week. This observation suggests a simple intervention to reduce DNA rate: schedule appointments for later in the week. Using data from a UK mental health hospital, we compared attendance rates for 12-months before and 12-months after the intervention began (916 appointments in total). Overall DNA rate fell from 34.2% pre-intervention to 23.4% post-intervention [χ2 (1, N = 916) = 13.01, p < 0.001; Relative Risk Reduction, 31.6%]. This effect was carried mainly by female patients, for whom more appointments could be moved to later in the week. Our findings confirm that DNA rate can be significantly reduced by loading appointments onto high-attendance days."
