https://openalex.org/W2949311293,"Understanding the diversity of cell types in the brain has been an enduring challenge and requires detailed characterization of individual neurons in multiple dimensions. To systematically profile morpho-electric properties of mammalian neurons, we established a single-cell characterization pipeline using standardized patch-clamp recordings in brain slices and biocytin-based neuronal reconstructions. We built a publicly accessible online database, the Allen Cell Types Database, to display these datasets. Intrinsic physiological properties were measured from 1,938 neurons from the adult laboratory mouse visual cortex, morphological properties were measured from 461 reconstructed neurons, and 452 neurons had both measurements available. Quantitative features were used to classify neurons into distinct types using unsupervised methods. We established a taxonomy of morphologically and electrophysiologically defined cell types for this region of the cortex, with 17 electrophysiological types, 38 morphological types and 46 morpho-electric types. There was good correspondence with previously defined transcriptomic cell types and subclasses using the same transgenic mouse lines."
https://openalex.org/W2950945543,"Both the timing and molecular determinants of metastasis are unknown, hindering treatment and prevention efforts. Here we characterize the evolutionary dynamics of this lethal process by analyzing exome-sequencing data from 118 biopsies from 23 patients with colorectal cancer with metastases to the liver or brain. The data show that the genomic divergence between the primary tumor and metastasis is low and that canonical driver genes were acquired early. Analysis within a spatial tumor growth model and statistical inference framework indicates that early disseminated cells commonly (81%, 17 out of 21 evaluable patients) seed metastases while the carcinoma is clinically undetectable (typically, less than 0.01 cm3). We validated the association between early drivers and metastasis in an independent cohort of 2,751 colorectal cancers, demonstrating their utility as biomarkers of metastasis. This conceptual and analytical framework provides quantitative in vivo evidence that systemic spread can occur early in colorectal cancer and illuminates strategies for patient stratification and therapeutic targeting of the canonical drivers of tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2952426443,"A key assumption of optogenetics is that light only affects opsin-expressing neurons. However, illumination invariably heats tissue, and many physiological processes are temperature-sensitive. Commonly used illumination protocols increased the temperature by 0.2–2 °C and suppressed spiking in multiple brain regions. In the striatum, light delivery activated an inwardly rectifying potassium conductance and biased rotational behavior. Thus, careful consideration of light-delivery parameters is required, as even modest intracranial heating can confound interpretation of optogenetic experiments. Optogenetics has revolutionized neuroscience, but intracranial illumination can cause off-target effects. Owen et al. identify a temperature-sensitive potassium current that modulates neuronal activity and behavior independent of opsin expression."
https://openalex.org/W2949485830,"Ligand-dependent protein degradation has emerged as a compelling strategy to pharmacologically control the protein content of cells. So far, however, only a limited number of E3 ligases have been found to support this process. Here, we use a chemical proteomic strategy that leverages broadly reactive, cysteine-directed electrophilic fragments coupled to selective ligands for intracellular proteins (for example, SLF for FKBP12, JQ1 for BRD4) to screen for heterobifunctional degrader compounds (or proteolysis targeting chimeras, PROTACs) that operate by covalent adduction of E3 ligases. This approach identified DCAF16—a poorly characterized substrate recognition component of CUL4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin ligases—as a target of electrophilic PROTACs that promote the nuclear-restricted degradation of proteins. We find that only a modest fraction (~10–40%) of DCAF16 needs to be modified to support protein degradation, pointing to the potential for electrophilic PROTACs to induce neosubstrate degradation without substantially perturbing the function of the participating E3 ligase."
https://openalex.org/W2950911502,"Nimbolide, a terpenoid natural product derived from the Neem tree, impairs cancer pathogenicity; however, the direct targets and mechanisms by which nimbolide exerts its effects are poorly understood. Here, we used activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) chemoproteomic platforms to discover that nimbolide reacts with a novel functional cysteine crucial for substrate recognition in the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF114. Nimbolide impairs breast cancer cell proliferation in-part by disrupting RNF114-substrate recognition, leading to inhibition of ubiquitination and degradation of tumor suppressors such as p21, resulting in their rapid stabilization. We further demonstrate that nimbolide can be harnessed to recruit RNF114 as an E3 ligase in targeted protein degradation applications and show that synthetically simpler scaffolds are also capable of accessing this unique reactive site. Our study highlights the use of ABPP platforms in uncovering unique druggable modalities accessed by natural products for cancer therapy and targeted protein degradation applications. The natural product nimbolide covalently reacts with a functional cysteine of the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF114, resulting in impaired substrate recognition and degradation, enabling the use of nimbolide for targeted protein degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2950336920,"Microglia rapidly respond to changes in neural activity and inflammation to regulate synaptic connectivity. The extracellular signals, particularly neuron-derived molecules, that drive these microglial functions at synapses remain a key open question. Here we show that whisker lesioning, known to dampen cortical activity, induces microglia-mediated synapse elimination. This synapse elimination is dependent on signaling by CX3CR1, the receptor for microglial fractalkine (also known as CXCL1), but not complement receptor 3. Furthermore, mice deficient in CX3CL1 have profound defects in synapse elimination. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that Cx3cl1 is derived from cortical neurons, and ADAM10, a metalloprotease that cleaves CX3CL1 into a secreted form, is upregulated specifically in layer IV neurons and in microglia following whisker lesioning. Finally, inhibition of ADAM10 phenocopies Cx3cr1−/− and Cx3cl1−/− synapse elimination defects. Together, these results identify neuron-to-microglia signaling necessary for cortical synaptic remodeling and reveal that context-dependent immune mechanisms are utilized to remodel synapses in the mammalian brain. Microglia are resident immune cells of the CNS. Here the authors show that neurons communicate to microglia via activity-dependent fractalkine and ADAM10 signaling to induce removal of synapses in the brain after sensory loss."
https://openalex.org/W2953085814,"We describe an experimental method of three-dimensional (3D) structure determination that exploits the increasing ease of high-throughput mutational scans. Inspired by the success of using natural, evolutionary sequence covariation to compute protein and RNA folds, we explored whether ‘laboratory’, synthetic sequence variation might also yield 3D structures. We analyzed five large-scale mutational scans and discovered that the pairs of residues with the largest positive epistasis in the experiments are sufficient to determine the 3D fold. We show that the strongest epistatic pairings from genetic screens of three proteins, a ribozyme and a protein interaction reveal 3D contacts within and between macromolecules. Using these experimental epistatic pairs, we compute ab initio folds for a GB1 domain (within 1.8 Å of the crystal structure) and a WW domain (2.1 Å). We propose strategies that reduce the number of mutants needed for contact prediction, suggesting that genomics-based techniques can efficiently predict 3D structure. The authors present a method for determining 3D protein structures using high-throughput mutation experiments. Pairs of residues with the largest positive epistasis are sufficient to determine the 3D fold."
https://openalex.org/W2950483953,"Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection is ubiquitous worldwide and is associated with multiple cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The importance of EBV viral genomic variation in NPC development and its striking epidemic in southern China has been poorly explored. Through large-scale genome sequencing of 270 EBV isolates and two-stage association study of EBV isolates from China, we identify two non-synonymous EBV variants within BALF2 that are strongly associated with the risk of NPC (odds ratio (OR) = 8.69, P = 9.69 × 10−25 for SNP 162476_C; OR = 6.14, P = 2.40 × 10−32 for SNP 163364_T). The cumulative effects of these variants contribute to 83% of the overall risk of NPC in southern China. Phylogenetic analysis of the risk variants reveals a unique origin in Asia, followed by clonal expansion in NPC-endemic regions. Our results provide novel insights into the NPC endemic in southern China and also enable the identification of high-risk individuals for NPC prevention. Whole-genome sequencing and association analysis of 270 Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) isolates from China identify two non-synonymous EBV variants within BALF2 that are strongly associated with the risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2949728293,"Tight junction barrier is critical to intestinal homeostasis. Applying antibiotics to treat infections is common in clinical practice, which may affect intestinal microbiota. Intestinal microbiota dysbiosis is involved in the occurrence of some gastrointestinal diseases. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the influence of antibiotics on intestinal tight junction barrier and the possible underlying mechanisms. Healthy adult female C57BL/6 mice were treated with a broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail for 14 days. 16S rDNA Illumina sequencing and headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-GC/MS) were respectively used to analyze microbial community and to detect short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) contents. In vivo intestinal paracellular permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-dextran) was measured. Protein expression was determined by immunoblotting. Immunofluoresence was applied to observe the distributions of ZO-1, LC3B and ASC. Antibiotics remarkably altered intestinal microbiota composition in healthy mice, accompanying reduced SCFAs' concentrations. In addition, the intestinal tight junction barrier was disrupted by antibiotic treatment, as evidenced by increased intestinal paracellular permeability to FITC-dextran, decreased tight junction protein expressions, and disrupted ZO-1 morphology. Furthermore, NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy were activated by antibiotic treatment. In conclusion, intestinal epithelial tight junction barrier dysfunction induced by antibiotics is associated with intestinal microbiota dysbiosis, activated NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2952214667,"Determining the three-dimensional structures of macromolecules is a major goal of biological research, because of the close relationship between structure and function; however, thousands of protein domains still have unknown structures. Structure determination usually relies on physical techniques including X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and cryo-electron microscopy. Here we present a method that allows the high-resolution three-dimensional backbone structure of a biological macromolecule to be determined only from measurements of the activity of mutant variants of the molecule. This genetic approach to structure determination relies on the quantification of genetic interactions (epistasis) between mutations and the discrimination of direct from indirect interactions. This provides an alternative experimental strategy for structure determination, with the potential to reveal functional and in vivo structures. This method predicts three-dimensional protein structures based on the activity of mutant variants. The approach relies on quantifying genetic interactions between mutations to infer direct contacts between residues."
https://openalex.org/W2952501183,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects up to 1 in 59 individuals1. Genome-wide association and large-scale sequencing studies strongly implicate both common variants2-4 and rare de novo variants5-10 in ASD. Recessive mutations have also been implicated11-14 but their contribution remains less well defined. Here we demonstrate an excess of biallelic loss-of-function and damaging missense mutations in a large ASD cohort, corresponding to approximately 5% of total cases, including 10% of females, consistent with a female protective effect. We document biallelic disruption of known or emerging recessive neurodevelopmental genes (CA2, DDHD1, NSUN2, PAH, RARB, ROGDI, SLC1A1, USH2A) as well as other genes not previously implicated in ASD including FEV (FEV transcription factor, ETS family member), which encodes a key regulator of the serotonergic circuitry. Our data refine estimates of the contribution of recessive mutation to ASD and suggest new paths for illuminating previously unknown biological pathways responsible for this condition."
https://openalex.org/W2951264754,"Cannabis is the most frequently used illicit psychoactive substance worldwide; around one in ten users become dependent. The risk for cannabis use disorder (CUD) has a strong genetic component, with twin heritability estimates ranging from 51 to 70%. Here we performed a genome-wide association study of CUD in 2,387 cases and 48,985 controls, followed by replication in 5,501 cases and 301,041 controls. We report a genome-wide significant risk locus for CUD (P = 9.31 × 10−12) that replicates in an independent population (Preplication = 3.27 × 10−3, Pmeta-analysis = 9.09 × 10−12). The index variant (rs56372821) is a strong expression quantitative trait locus for cholinergic receptor nicotinic α2 subunit (CHRNA2); analyses of the genetically regulated gene expression identified a significant association of CHRNA2 expression with CUD in brain tissue. At the polygenic level, analyses revealed a significant decrease in the risk of CUD with increased load of variants associated with cognitive performance. The results provide biological insights and inform on the genetic architecture of CUD. The study reports a genome-wide significant locus for cannabis use disorder, replicating in an independent cohort, and implicates CHRNA2, which encodes an acetylcholine receptor subunit, in the disorder by analyses of genetically regulated gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2949426619,"Protein-DNA interactions are critical to the regulation of gene expression, but it remains challenging to define how cell-to-cell heterogeneity in protein-DNA binding influences gene expression variability. Here we report a method for the simultaneous quantification of protein-DNA contacts by combining single-cell DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) with messenger RNA sequencing of the same cell (scDam&T-seq). We apply scDam&T-seq to reveal how genome-lamina contacts or chromatin accessibility correlate with gene expression in individual cells. Furthermore, we provide single-cell genome-wide interaction data on a polycomb-group protein, RING1B, and the associated transcriptome. Our results show that scDam&T-seq is sensitive enough to distinguish mouse embryonic stem cells cultured under different conditions and their different chromatin landscapes. Our method will enable the analysis of protein-mediated mechanisms that regulate cell-type-specific transcriptional programs in heterogeneous tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2951086344,"The lateral habenula encodes aversive stimuli contributing to negative emotional states during drug withdrawal. Here we report that morphine withdrawal in mice leads to microglia adaptations and diminishes glutamatergic transmission onto raphe-projecting lateral habenula neurons. Chemogenetic inhibition of this circuit promotes morphine withdrawal-like social deficits. Morphine withdrawal-driven synaptic plasticity and reduced sociability require tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) release and neuronal TNF receptor 1 activation. Hence, habenular cytokines control synaptic and behavioral adaptations during drug withdrawal. The authors show that decreased synaptic efficacy onto raphe-projecting lateral habenula neurons supports opiate withdrawal-induced sociability deficits, and they demonstrate a role for TNF-α signaling in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2949702355,"Objectives Primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by reduced lacrimal and salivary secretion. Sicca symptoms together with fatigue and musculoskeletal pain can significantly reduce the patients’ quality of life. Furthermore, low salivary secretion may disrupt the oral microbial homeostasis. The aim of this study was to compare the salivary microbiota from pSS patients with patients with sicca symptoms not fulfilling the classification criteria for pSS (non-SS), and with healthy controls without sicca complaints. Methods Pellets from centrifuged chewing-stimulated whole saliva from pSS patients (n = 15), non-SS sicca patients (n = 15) and healthy controls (n = 15) were prepared. DNA was extracted and analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The acquired sequencing data were performed using the human oral microbiome database (HOMD). Results We detected 42, 45, and 34 bacterial genera in saliva samples from pSS patients, non-SS sicca patients, and healthy controls, respectively. The most abundant genera in all samples were Prevotella, Veillonella, Streptococcus, and Haemophilus. At species level Streptococcus intermedius, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella nancensis, Tannerella spp., and Treponema spp. were detected in the samples from pSS and non-SS only, while Porphyromonas pasteri was mostly found among the healthy controls. Conclusion Our study indicated dysbiosis in the salivary microbiota from pSS and non-SS patients compared to healthy controls. Additionally, the results showed that the salivary microbiome in the pSS group differed significantly from the non-SS group."
https://openalex.org/W2950952672,"Locating diseases precisely from medical images, like ultrasonic and CT images, have been one of the most challenging problems in medical image analysis. In recent years, the vigorous development of deep learning models have greatly improved the accuracy in disease location on medical images. However, there are few artificial intelligent methods for identifying cholelithiasis and classifying gallstones on CT images, since no open source CT images dataset of cholelithiasis and gallstones is available for training the models and verifying their performance. In this paper, we build up the first medical image dataset of cholelithiasis by collecting 223846 CT images with gallstone of 1369 patients. With these CT images, a neural network is trained to “pick up” CT images of high quality as training set, and then a novel Yolo neural network, named Yolov3-arch neural network, is proposed to identify cholelithiasis and classify gallstones on CT images. Identification and classification accuracies are obtained by 10-fold cross-validations. It is obtained that our Yolov3-arch model is with average accuracy 92.7% in identifying granular gallstones and average accuracy 80.3% in identifying muddy gallstones. This achieves 3.5% and 8% improvements in identifying granular and muddy gallstones to general Yolo v3 model, respectively. Also, the average cholelithiasis identifying accuracy is improved to 86.50% from 80.75%. Meanwhile, our method can reduce the misdiagnosis rate of negative samples by the object detection model."
https://openalex.org/W2951825772,"Microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) is a potential method for improvement of soil. A laboratory study was conducted to investigate the influence of temperatures for soil improvement by MICP. The ureolytic activity experiments, MICP experiments in aqueous solution and sand column using Sporosarcina pasteurii were conducted at different temperatures(10, 15, 20, 25 and 30°C). The results showed there were microbially induced CaCO3 precipitation at all the temperatures from 10 to 30°C. The results of ureolytic activity experiments showed that the bacterial had higher ureolytic activity at high temperatures within the early 20 hours, however, the ureolytic activity at higher temperatures decreased more quickly than at lower temperatures. The results of MICP experiments in aqueous solution and sand column were consistent with tests of ureolytic activity. Within 20 to 50 hours of the start of the test, more CaCO3 precipitation was precipitated at higher temperature, subsequently, the precipitation rate of all experiments decreased, and the higher the temperature, the faster the precipitation rate dropped. The final precipitation amount of CaCO3 in aqueous solution and sand column tests at 10 °C was 92% and 37% higher than that at 30 °C. The maximum unconfined compressive strength of MICP treated sand column at 10 °C was 135% higher than that at 30 °C. The final treatment effect of MICP at lower temperature was better than that at high temperature within the temperature range studied. The reason for better treatment effect at lower temperatures was due to the longer retention time of ureolytic activity of bacteria at lower temperatures."

Here we visualize the interaction between the Escherichia coli acyl carrier protein (AcpP) and β-ketoacyl-ACP-synthase I (FabB) using X-ray crystallography, NMR, and molecular dynamics simulations. We leveraged this structural information to alter lipid profiles in vivo and provide a molecular basis for how protein-protein interactions can regulate the fatty acid profile in E. coli."
https://openalex.org/W2950075861,"The pathophysiology of refractive errors is poorly understood. Myopia (nearsightedness) in particular both blurs vision and predisposes the eye to many blinding diseases during adulthood. Based on past findings of diurnal variations in the dimensions of the eyes of humans and other vertebrates, altered diurnal rhythms of these ocular dimensions with experimentally induced myopia, and evolving evidence that ambient light exposures influence refractive development, we assessed whether disturbances in circadian signals might alter the refractive development of the eye. In mice, retinal-specific knockout of the clock gene Bmal1 induces myopia and elongates the vitreous chamber, the optical compartment separating the lens and the retina. These alterations simulate common ocular findings in clinical myopia. In Drosophila melanogaster, knockouts of the clock genes cycle or period lengthen the pseudocone, the optical component of the ommatidium that separates the facet lens from the photoreceptors. Disrupting circadian signaling thus alters optical development of the eye in widely separated species. We propose that mechanisms of myopia include circadian dysregulation, a frequent occurrence in modern societies where myopia also is both highly prevalent and increasing at alarming rates. Addressing circadian dysregulation may improve understanding of the pathogenesis of refractive errors and introduce novel therapeutic approaches to ameliorate myopia development in children."
https://openalex.org/W2951567773,"The temporal and spatial evolution of malaria was described for the postfrontier phase of the Brazilian Amazon in 2003-2013. The current ecological study aimed to understand the relationship between spatial population mobility and the distribution of malaria cases. The study identified epidemiologically relevant areas using regional statistical modeling and spatial analyses that considered differential infections and types of work activities. Annual parasite incidence (API) in the region was highest in hotspots along the Amazon River and in the south and west settlement zone of Hiléia, with concentrations in environmental protection areas and açaí and Brazil nut extraction areas. The dispersal force decreased in the Central Amazon due to rapid urbanization and improved socioeconomic conditions for workers in consolidated settlement areas. The study characterized the spatial patterns of disease transmission according to the economic activity and regionalization of geographic areas, confirming that the incidence of infection by work activity and labor flow is linked to extractive activities and agricultural settlements."
https://openalex.org/W2951159369,"Acute pancreatitis (AP) is acute inflammation of the pancreas, mainly caused by gallstones and alcohol, driven by changes in communication between cells. Heparin-binding proteins (HBPs) play a central role in health and diseases. Therefore, we used heparin affinity proteomics to identify extracellular HBPs in pancreas and plasma of normal mice and in a caerulein mouse model of AP. Many new extracellular HBPs (360) were discovered in the pancreas, taking the total number of HBPs known to 786. Extracellular pancreas HBPs form highly interconnected protein-protein interaction networks in both normal pancreas (NP) and AP. Thus, HBPs represent an important set of extracellular proteins with significant regulatory potential in the pancreas. HBPs in NP are associated with biological functions such as molecular transport and cellular movement that underlie pancreatic homeostasis. However, in AP HBPs are associated with additional inflammatory processes such as acute phase response signalling, complement activation and mitochondrial dysfunction, which has a central role in the development of AP. Plasma HBPs in AP included known AP biomarkers such as serum amyloid A, as well as emerging targets such as histone H2A. Other HBPs such as alpha 2-HS glycoprotein (AHSG) and histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) need further investigation for potential applications in the management of AP. Pancreas HBPs are extracellular and so easily accessible and are potential drug targets in AP, whereas plasma HBPs represent potential biomarkers for AP. Thus, their identification paves the way to determine which HBPs may have potential applications in the management of AP."
https://openalex.org/W2951264729,"SNP datasets are high-dimensional, often with thousands to millions of SNPs and hundreds to thousands of samples or individuals. Accordingly, PCA graphs are frequently used to provide a low-dimensional visualization in order to display and discover patterns in SNP data from humans, animals, plants, and microbes—especially to elucidate population structure. PCA is not a single method that is always done the same way, but rather requires three choices which we explore as a three-way factorial: two kinds of PCA graphs by three SNP codings by six PCA variants. Our main three recommendations are simple and easily implemented: Use PCA biplots, SNP coding 1 for the rare allele and 0 for the common allele, and double-centered PCA (or AMMI1 if main effects are also of interest). We also document contemporary practices by a literature survey of 125 representative articles that apply PCA to SNP data, find that virtually none implement our recommendations. The ultimate benefit from informed and optimal choices of PCA graph, SNP coding, and PCA variant, is expected to be discovery of more biology, and thereby acceleration of medical, agricultural, and other vital applications."
https://openalex.org/W2952057388,"Purpose To investigate associations between lipid profiles and fatigue in a cohort of progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) patients on a diet-based multimodal intervention. Methods This pilot study included 18 progressive MS patients who participated in a prospective longitudinal study of fatigue following a diet-based multimodal intervention that included exercise, neuromuscular electrical stimulation and stress reduction. The diet recommended high intake of vegetables and fruits, encouraged consumption of animal and plant protein and excluded foods with gluten-containing grains, dairy and eggs. Fatigue was measured on the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) at baseline and every 3 months for 12 months. A lipid profile consisting of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) was obtained on fasting blood samples at baseline and 12 months. Results FSS scores decreased from a baseline of 5.51 (95% CI: 4.86, 6.16) to a mean of 3.03 (95% CI: 2.23, 3.82) at 12 months (p < 0.001). At 12 months, increases in HDL-C (mean change: +6.0 mg/dl; 95% CI: 0.3, 12.0; p = 0.049) and decreases in BMI (mean change: -2.6 kg/m2; 95% CI: -3.6, -2.5; p < 0.001), LDL-C (mean change: -10.4 mg/dl; 95% CI:-19.7, -1.2; p = 0.029), TG (mean change: -29.2 mg/dl; 95% CI: -44.3, -14.2; p = 0.001), TG to HDL-C ratio (mean change: -0.6; 95% CI: -1.0, -0.3; p = 0.002) and TC to HDL-C ratio (mean change:-0.6; 95% CI: -1.0, -0.3; p = 0.003) were observed compared to baseline. Improvements in FSS were associated with increases in HDL-C (β = -0.05; 95% CI: -0.1, -0.0004; p = 0.048) and changes in TC (p = 0.005) from baseline to 12 months. Conclusions Lipid profile variables are associated with improvements in fatigue in progressive MS patients on a diet-based multimodal intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2952411925,"Use of cardiopulmonary bypass in cardiac surgery triggers systemic inflammation by neutrophil activation leading to neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) release. Hence, nuclear DNA released by necrotic and apoptotic cells might contribute to an increase in circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA). cfDNA/NETs might induce endothelial damage and organ dysfunction. This study focuses on the accuracy of cfDNA to predict acute kidney injury (AKI) after on-pump surgery. 58 cardiac patients undergoing on-pump surgery were prospectively enrolled. Blood samples were taken preoperatively, immediately after surgery, at day 1, 2, 3 and 5 from patients with (n = 21) or without (n = 37) postoperative AKI development. Levels of cfDNA, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and creatinine in patients’ plasma were quantified. ROC curves were used to assess the predictive value of the biomarkers for AKI. Further baseline characteristics and perioperative variables were analyzed.cfDNA and NGAL levels highly increased in AKI patients and significant intergroup differences (vs. non-AKI) were found until day 3 and day 5 after surgery, respectively. cfDNA levels were significantly elevated in patients who developed late AKI (>24 hours), but not in those with AKI development during the first 24 hours (early AKI). NGAL and creatinine, which were highest in patients with early AKI, accurately predicted during the first 24 postoperative hours (early AKI). At day 3, at a threshold of 260.53 ng/ml cfDNA was the best predictor for AKI (AUC = 0.804) compared to NGAL (AUC = 0.699) and creatinine (AUC = 0.688). NGAL, but not cfDNA, was strongly associated with AKI stages and mortality. Monitoring of cfDNA levels from the first postoperative day might represent a valuable tool to predict late AKI after on-pump surgery."
https://openalex.org/W2951195415,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly recognized as important mediators of intercellular communication that carry protein, lipids, and nucleic acids via the circulation to target cells whereupon they mediate physiological changes. In pregnancy, EVs are released in high quantities from the placenta and have been postulated to target multiple cell types, including those of the vascular and immune systems. However, most studies of pregnancy-associated EVs have used clinical samples and in vitro models; to date, few studies have taken advantage of murine models in which pregnancy can be precisely timed and manipulated. In this study, we used a murine model to determine whether the quantity of EVs is altered during healthy pregnancy and during inflammation-associated preterm birth. To facilitate data analysis, we developed a novel software package, tidyNano, an R package that provides functions to import, clean, and quickly summarize raw data generated by the nanoparticle tracking device, NanoSight (Malvern Panalytical). We also developed shinySIGHT, a Shiny web application that allows for interactive exploration and visualization of EV data. In mice, EV concentration in blood increased linearly across pregnancy, with significant rises at GD14.5 and 17.5 relative to EV concentrations in nonpregnant females. Additionally, lipopolysaccharide treatment resulted in a significant reduction in circulating EV concentrations relative to vehicle-treated controls at GD16.5 within 4 hours. Use of tidyNano facilitated rapid analysis of EV data; importantly, this package provides a straightforward framework by which diverse types of large datasets can be simply and efficiently analyzed, is freely available under the MIT license, and is hosted on GitHub (https://nguyens7.github.io/tidyNano/). Our data highlight the utility of the mouse as a model of EV biology in pregnancy, and suggest that placental dysfunction is associated with reduced circulating EVs."

We conducted in-depth interviews with 22 women who screened positive for depression using a locally validated Chichewa version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at antenatal and postnatal clinics in 1 rural and 1 urban health care setting in Lilongwe District, Malawi. We also conducted 10 key informant interviews with maternal care health workers. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. An interview guide was used to guide enquiry about perceptions of perinatal depression and health service needs. Interviews were transcribed, translated and analysed using content analysis approach.Perinatal depression was recognized as a common mental health problem that affected self-care activities and functioning of women in the perinatal period. Financial difficulties, relationship problems (polygamy, lack of support, neglect, and infidelity), traumatic events (intimate partner violence and loss) and fear of birth outcomes were identified as causes of depression. All study participants acknowledged the need for support and an intervention that will address the identified challenges. Additionally, they viewed strengthening the health delivery system as crucial to effectively address their needs and gaps identified in the system.The results of this study support plans to develop a family focused intervention for perinatal depression in Malawi addressing relationship, psychosocial and economic issues. It also highlights the importance of strengthening the health delivery system especially at primary care level where the majority of women access care in Malawi and across Sub-Saharan Africa."

We quantified movement of aphidophagous predators between soybean and five adjacent habitats common in Manitoba using bi-directional Malaise traps. To test the contribution of predators from neighboring habitats to soybean aphid suppression, we performed experimental manipulations in adjacent soybean and alfalfa fields and monitored the movement of sevenspotted lady beetles, Coccinella septempunctata, using mark-release-recapture experiments. The identity of adjacent habitats affected the net movement of predators into soybean. The most abundant predators were hover flies (Diptera: Syrphidae), moving from woodlands to soybean. Similar (but non-significant) trends were found for lady beetles, minute pirate bugs, and green and brown lacewings. There was also a net movement of hover flies and green lacewings from soybean to canola. Lady beetles showed higher bidirectional movement in alfalfa and wheat borders than in woodland and canola borders in a high lady beetle abundance year. Soybean aphid populations in predator exclusion cages were 21- to 122- fold higher than populations exposed to predators, both in alfalfa and soybean fields. Aerial predators provide similar levels of aphid suppression as aerial and epigeal predators combined. Mark-release-recapture experiments showed high dispersal of C. septempunctata between soybean and alfalfa, with a net movement towards alfalfa, probably due to the lack of aphids in soybean. These results demonstrate that predator assemblages from both soybeans and alfalfa can suppress soybean aphids. Our findings indicate that the type of adjacent habitat and predator identity affect the directionality of predator movement into soybean. This study suggests that information on predator movement can be used to design the distribution of crops and natural habitats in agricultural landscapes that maximize pest control services."
https://openalex.org/W2949336676,"Poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) depolymerase is known to decompose PHB, biodegradable polymers and therefore has great commercial significance in the bioplastic sector. However, reports on PHB depolymerases from isolates obtained from plastic-contaminated sites that reflect the potential of the source organism is scarce. In this study, we evaluated the production of extracellular PHB depolymerase from Microbacterium paraoxydans RZS6 isolated from the plastic-contaminated site in the municipal area of Shahada, Maharashtra, India, for the first time. The isolate was identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, gas chromatographic analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (GC-FAME), and BIOLOG method. Ithydrolyzed PHB on minimal salt medium (MSM) containing PHB as the only source of carbon. The isolate produced PHB depolymerase at 45°C during 48 h of incubation. The enzyme was purified most efficiently using octyl-sepharose CL-4B column, with the highest purification yield of 6.675 Umg-1mL-1. The activity of the enzyme was enhanced in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions but inhibited by Fe2+ (1 mM) ions and mercaptoethanol (1000 rpm). the nzyme kinetic analysis revealed that the enzyme was a metalloenzyme; requiring Mg2+ ions, that showed optimum enzyme activity at 30°C (mesophilic) and under neutrophilic (pH 7) conditions. Scale-up from the shake-flask level to a laboratory-scale bioreactor further enhanced the enzyme yield by 0.809 UmL-1. The molecular weight of the enzyme (40 kDa), as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, closely resembled the PHB depolymerase of Aureobacterium saperdae. Our findings highlighted the applicability of M. paraoxydans as a producer of extracellular PHB depolymerase having potential of degrading PHB under diverse conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2952496588,"Stress-induced cardiac hypertrophy leads to heart failure. Our previous studies demonstrate that insulin-like growth factor—II receptor (IGF-IIR) signaling is pivotal to hypertrophy regulation. In this study, we show a novel IGF-IIR alternative spliced transcript, IGF-IIRα (150 kDa) play a key role in high-salt induced hypertrophy mechanisms. Cardiac overexpression of IGF-IIRα and high-salt diet influenced cardiac dysfunction by increasing pathophysiological changes with up-regulation of hypertrophy markers, atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). We found that, cardiac hypertrophy under high-salt conditions were amplified in the presence of IGF-IIRα overexpression. Importantly, high-salt induced angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) up regulation mediated IGF-IIR expressions via upstream mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)/silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1)/heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) pathway. Further, G-coupled receptors (Gαq) activated calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 3 (NFATc3)/protein kinase C (PKC) signaling was significantly up regulated under high-salt conditions. All these effects were observed to be dramatically over-regulated in IGF-IIRα transgenic rats fed with a high-salt diet. Altogether, from the findings, we demonstrate that IGF-IIRα plays a crucial role during high-salt conditions leading to synergistic cardiac hypertrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2952726109,"Compared with the idealized isotropic coal seam, the effectively cracking distances of deep-hole pre-splitting blasting in different directions have significant difference in the structural anisotropy of coal seam. In this paper, based on the test results of coal mechanical parameters in different coring directions, the blasting crack distances in these coring directions of coal seam are theoretically calculated and analyzed, and then a new method of blasthole layout in coal seam is designed and the blasting crack effect is investigated according to the test data of gas drainage. The research results show that both compressive strength and tensile strength of the direction of perpendicular to bedding are larger than that in other directions, especially parallel to bedding. The blasting crack distances of calculation results are in great agreement with that of underground in-situ measurement, so the blasting crack zone caused by the differences of mechanical properties in different directions can be approximately treated as an ellipse. Comparing the conventional method of blasthole layout, the blasting crack effect with new method has greatly enhanced the methane concentration and gas drainage quantity. Pure methane quantities with the new method and conventional method are about 2.8 times and 1.67 times as large as that before blasting, and pure methane quantity with the new method is about 1.46 times that with the conventional method. Therefore, considering the anisotropic characteristics of coal seams, the reasonable blasthole layout plays an important role for enhancing gas drainage in low permeability and outburst working face."

By the end of 2017, the program had supported the publication of hundreds of scholarly works, but it was unclear to what extent it had stimulated the development of a new research community. We identified 307 works funded by the MoBE program, as well as a comparison set of 698 authors who published in the same journals during the same period of time but were not part of the Sloan Foundation-funded collaboration. Our analysis of collaboration networks for both groups of authors suggests that the Sloan Foundation’s program resulted in a more consolidated community of researchers, specifically in terms of number of components, diameter, density, and transitivity of the coauthor networks. In addition to highlighting the success of this particular program, our method could be applied to other fields to examine the impact of funding programs and other large-scale initiatives on the formation of research communities."
https://openalex.org/W2952058196,"The “ship” of the Arabian and North African deserts, the one-humped dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) has a remarkable capacity to survive in conditions of extreme heat without needing to drink water. One of the ways that this is achieved is through the actions of the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP), which is made in a specialised part of the brain called the hypothalamo-neurohypophyseal system (HNS), but exerts its effects at the level of the kidney to provoke water conservation. Interestingly, our electron microscopy studies have shown that the ultrastructure of the dromedary HNS changes according to season, suggesting that in the arid conditions of summer the HNS is in an activated state, in preparation for the likely prospect of water deprivation. Based on our dromedary genome sequence, we have carried out an RNAseq analysis of the dromedary HNS in summer and winter. Amongst the 171 transcripts found to be significantly differentially regulated (>2 fold change, p value <0.05) there is a significant over-representation of neuropeptide encoding genes, including that encoding AVP, the expression of which appeared to increase in summer. Identification of neuropeptides in the HNS and analysis of neuropeptide profiles in extracts from individual camels using mass spectrometry indicates that overall AVP peptide levels decreased in the HNS during summer compared to winter, perhaps due to increased release during periods of dehydration in the dry season."

Objectives To determine the prevalence and factors associated with renal dysfunction among children with SCD aged 6 months to 12 years attended at a tertiary hospital in Northwestern Tanzania. Methods A cross sectional hospital-based study with a short follow up component of 3 months for 153 children with SCD was done to document demographics, clinical characteristics and features of renal dysfunction including urine dipstick albuminuria (>20mg/l) and eGFR (<60ml/ml/min/1.73m2). Other potential renal insults such as HIV infection and Schistosomiasis were also evaluated. Results At enrollment, 48/153(31.37%) children had renal dysfunction declining to 31(20.3%) at 3 months follow up. Acute chest syndrome (OR 3.04, 95% CI [1.08–8.96], p = 0.044), severe anemia (OR 0.44, 95% CI [0.26–0.76],p = 0.003), urinary schistosomiasis (OR 7.43, 95% CI [2.10–26.32] p<0.002) and acute malnutrition (OR 4.92, 95% CI [1.29–18.84], p = 0.020). were associated with renal dysfunction. Conclusion Where prevalent, urinary schistosomiasis and acute malnutrition increase the risk for renal dysfunction in children with SCD. We recommend albuminuria routine screening in children with SCD especially those presenting with acute chest syndrome, severe anemia and features of acute malnutrition for early detection of renal dysfunction among children with SCD."
https://openalex.org/W2953332052,"We investigated the differences in biological behaviors of sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) between young and elderly patients. CRC is a common cancer, with a mean age at onset of > 65 years. However, recent reports indicate increasing rates in younger populations. The biological behaviors of sporadic CRC in elderly patients could differ from those in young patients.Between September 2007 and August 2012, we selected 723 CRC patients from our institution. The patients were divided into Group Y (n = 127, aged ≤50 years) and Group O (n = 596, aged >50 years). The clinicopathologic and oncologic outcomes in the two groups were compared.Group Y tumors were characterized by higher incidences of mucin production (13.4% vs. 6.7%; P = 0.017), high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) (19.8% vs. 5.2%; P < 0.001), and N2 stage (32.3% vs. 22.1%; P = 0.020) than those in Group O. The recurrence rates were similar in both groups (14.9% vs. 17.3%; P = 0.665). The 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival did not differ. Multivariate analysis indicated that cellular differentiation and pathologic stage were significant prognostic factors for 5-year overall survival.Although age was not a prognostic factor for overall survival and young patients did not show a worse prognosis, there were differences in mucin production, MSI-H, and N2 stage between the two groups. Further studies are needed to clarify the clinical and biological characteristics of CRC, improve its treatment strategies, and promote better outcomes in young patients."
https://openalex.org/W2949186947,"We evaluated the difference in awareness of stroke warning signs (SWS) and emergency response among occupational groups in the community-dwelling population. From the 2016 Korea Community Health Survey, a total of 10,445 individuals without stroke were included in the analysis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to explore the association of occupation with awareness of SWS and correct emergency response. SWS included the following: sudden numbness or weakness, sudden difficulty speaking or understanding speech, sudden dizziness, sudden visual impairment, and sudden severe headache. Respondents' occupation was classified into six groups: managers and professionals (MP); clerks; service and sales workers (SSW); agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers (AFFW); mechanical and manual laborers (MML); or housewives and unemployed people (HUP). Awareness of each SWS was the same with the highest for MP and lowest for AFFW. After adjusting for socio-demographic factors, compared to MP (reference), AFFW (odds ratio 0.49; 95% confidence interval 0.36-0.67), HUP (0.55; 0.40-0.75), MML (0.57; 0.42-0.79), and SSW (0.62; 0.45-0.86) had significantly lower ORs for knowing at least one of the SWS. Additionally, AFFW (0.79; 0.66-0.96) and MML (0.76; 0.63-0.91) had significantly lower ORs for knowing all five SWS compared to MP. However, there was no significant occupational difference in correct emergency response when a stroke occurred. To improve stroke literacy and to reduce the disparity of awareness of SWS in community settings, public health efforts with an emphasis on AFFW and MML are needed."
https://openalex.org/W2949440588,"Dietary insufficiencies have been well documented to decrease growth rates and survival (and therefore overall production) in fish aquaculture. By contrast, the effects of dietary insufficiencies on the sensory biology of cultured fish remains largely unstudied. Diets based solely on plant protein sources could have advantages over fish-based diets because of the cost and ecological effects of the latter, but plant proteins lack the amino acid taurine. Adequate levels of taurine are, however, necessary for the development of a fully functional visual system in mammals. As part of ongoing studies to determine the suitability of plant-based diets, we investigated the effects of normal and reduced taurine dietary levels on retinal anatomy and function in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). We could not demonstrate any effects of dietary taurine level on retinal anatomy, nor the functional properties of luminous sensitivity and temporal resolution (measured as flicker fusion frequency). We did, however, find an effect on spectral sensitivity. The peak of spectral sensitivity of individuals fed a 5% taurine diet was rightward shifted (i.e., towards longer wavelengths) relative to that of fish fed a 0% or 1.5% taurine diet. This difference in in spectral sensitivity was due to a relatively lower level of middle wavelength pigment (maximum absorbance .500 nm) in fish fed a 5% taurine diet. Changes in spectral sensitivity resulting from diets containing different taurine levels are unlikely to be detrimental to fish destined for market, but could be in fishes that are being reared for stock enhancement programs."
https://openalex.org/W2952902714,"Bone finite element (FE) studies based on infant post-mortem computed tomography (CT) examinations are being developed to provide quantitative information to assist the differentiation between accidental and inflicted injury, and unsuspected underlying disease. As the growing skeleton contains non-ossified cartilaginous regions at the epiphyses, which are not well characterised on CT examinations, it is difficult to evaluate the mechanical behaviour of the developing whole bone. This study made use of paired paediatric post mortem femoral CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations at two different stages of development (4 and 7 months) to provide anatomical and constitutive information for both hard and soft tissues. The work aimed to evaluate the effect of epiphyseal ossification on the propensity to shaft fractures in infants. The outcomes suggest that the failure load of the femoral diaphysis in the models incorporating the non-ossified epiphysis is within the range of bone-only FE models. There may however be an effect on the metaphysis. Confirmation of these findings is required in a larger cohort of children."
https://openalex.org/W2953355797,"Soil microbiome responses to short-term nitrogen (N) inputs remain uncertain when compared with previous research that has focused on long-term fertilization responses. Here, we examined soil bacterial/archaeal and fungal communities pre- and post-N fertilization in an 8 year-old switchgrass field, in which twenty-four plots received N fertilization at three levels (0, 100, and 200 kg N ha-1 as NH4NO3) for the first time since planting. Soils were collected at two depths, 0–5 and 5–15 cm, for DNA extraction and amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and ITS regions for assessment of microbial community composition. Baseline assessments prior to fertilization revealed no significant pre-existing divergence in either bacterial/archaeal or fungal communities across plots. The one-time N fertilizations increased switchgrass yields and tissue N content, and the added N was nearly completely removed from the soil of fertilized plots by the end of the growing season. Both bacterial/archaeal and fungal communities showed large spatial (by depth) and temporal variation (by season) within each plot, accounting for 17 and 12–22% of the variation as calculated from the Sq. root of PERMANOVA tests for bacterial/archaeal and fungal community composition, respectively. While N fertilization effects accounted for only ~4% of overall variation, some specific microbial groups, including the bacterial genus Pseudonocardia and the fungal genus Archaeorhizomyces, were notably repressed by fertilization at 200 kg N ha-1. Bacterial groups varied with both depth in the soil profile and time of sampling, while temporal variability shaped the fungal community more significantly than vertical heterogeneity in the soil. These results suggest that short-term effects of N fertilization are significant but subtle, and other sources of variation will need to be carefully accounted for study designs including multiple intra-annual sampling dates, rather than one-time “snapshot” analyses that are common in the literature. Continued analyses of these trends over time with fertilization and management are needed to understand how these effects may persist or change over time."

Safety and reactogenicity were assessed, and seroconversion rates (i.e. proportion of participants with a ≥ 4-fold rise from baseline in serum vibriocidal antibody titers against V. cholerae O1 Inaba, O1 Ogawa and O139, respectively) were determined 14 days after each vaccine dose. No serious adverse events were reported during the study. Commonly reported solicited adverse events were headache and general ill feeling. Seroconversion rates after the first and second dose in adults were 67.7% and 55.2%, respectively, against O1 Inaba; 47.9% and 45.8% against O1 Ogawa; and 19.8% and 20.8% against O139. In children, seroconversion rates after the first and second dose were 80.2% and 68.8%, respectively, against O1 Inaba; 72.9% and 67.7% against O1 Ogawa; and 26.0% and 18.8% against O139. The geometric mean titers against O1 Inaba, O1 Ogawa, and O139 in both adults and children were significantly higher after each vaccine dose compared to baseline titers (P < 0.001; for both age groups after each dose versus baseline). The seroconversion rates for O1 Inaba, O1 Ogawa, and O139 in both age groups were similar to those in previous studies with the vaccine. In conclusion, the killed, bivalent, whole-cell oral cholera vaccine has a good safety and reactogenicity profile, and is immunogenic in healthy adults and children.

https://openalex.org/W2950001497,"Most studies on perceptions of social structures in organizations rely on cross-sectional evidence and lack a longitudinal perspective. In order to address this gap, we collected whole network perception data at three time points from a cohort of MBA students. First, we asked whether or not individuals become more accurate in their perception of the network over time. We found no significant increase in accuracy. Second, we examined one's perception of his or her own direct ties and found a consistent tendency to inflate incoming friendship ties, confirming existing studies. However, we find that individuals were quite capable of recognizing the broader dynamics of social hierarchy (i.e., whether they were becoming more or less popular) even as they became no more accurate in understanding either the overall networks or their own ego-net. Third, we explored possible explanations for the persistence of perception errors and showed that most of the errors at time point two and time point three were due to a failure to update previous perception decisions. Finally, we shifted the analysis from accuracy at a given time point and considered the narrative arc of dyadic relations. Our findings suggest that stable dyads across time are more likely to be accurately perceived whereas other types of dyads are poorly tracked. We conclude by presenting possible research questions for future studies to further our understanding of the temporal aspects of network perception."
https://openalex.org/W2950009203,"Heart failure (HF) is characterized, among other factors, by a progressive loss of contractile function and by the formation of an arrhythmogenic substrate, both aspects partially related to intracellular Ca2+ cycling disorders. In failing hearts both electrophysiological and structural remodeling, including fibroblast proliferation, contribute to changes in Ca2+ handling which promote the appearance of Ca2+ alternans (Ca-alt). Ca-alt in turn give rise to repolarization alternans, which promote dispersion of repolarization and contribute to reentrant activity. The computational analysis of the incidence of Ca2+ and/or repolarization alternans under HF conditions in the presence of fibroblasts could provide a better understanding of the mechanisms leading to HF arrhythmias and contractile function disorders.The goal of the present study was to investigate in silico the mechanisms leading to the formation of Ca-alt in failing human ventricular myocytes and tissues with disperse fibroblast distributions. The contribution of ionic currents variability to alternans formation at the cellular level was analyzed and the results show that in normal ventricular tissue, altered Ca2+ dynamics lead to Ca-alt, which precede APD alternans and can be aggravated by the presence of fibroblasts. Electrophysiological remodeling of failing tissue alone is sufficient to develop alternans. The incidence of alternans is reduced when fibroblasts are present in failing tissue due to significantly depressed Ca2+ transients. The analysis of the underlying ionic mechanisms suggests that Ca-alt are driven by Ca2+-handling protein and Ca2+ cycling dysfunctions in the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum and that their contribution to alternans occurrence depends on the cardiac remodeling conditions and on myocyte-fibroblast interactions.It can thus be concluded that fibroblasts modulate the formation of Ca-alt in human ventricular tissue subjected to heart failure-related electrophysiological remodeling. Pharmacological therapies should thus consider the extent of both the electrophysiological and structural remodeling present in the failing heart."

Objectives To demonstrate how careful study design can reveal POLST’s impact at hospital admission and why analyses of state registry data are unlikely to capture POLST’s effects. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting and participants Adult in-patients with Do Not Intubate and/or Do Not Resuscitate (DNR/I) orders in the electronic medical record at the time of discharge from Johns Hopkins Hospital over 18 months. For patients with unplanned readmissions within 30 days, records were reviewed to determine if a Maryland Medical Order for Life-Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) form was presented and for the time from readmission to a DNR/I order in the EMR. Analyses were stratified by whether patients could communicate or were accompanied by a proxy at readmission. Results Among 1,507 patients with DNR/I orders at discharge, 124 (8%) had unplanned readmissions, 112 (90%) could communicate or were accompanied by a proxy at readmission, and 12 (10%) could not communicate and were unaccompanied. For patients who were unaccompanied and could not communicate, MOLST significantly decreased the median time from readmission to DNR/I order (1.2 vs 27.1 hours, P = .001), but this association was greatly attenuated among patients who could communicate or were accompanied by a proxy (16.4 vs 25.4 hours P = .10). Conclusion Among patients who wanted to avoid intubation and/or CPR, MOLST forms were protective when the patient was unaccompanied by a healthcare proxy at admission and could not communicate. Fewer than 10% of patients met these criteria during unplanned readmissions, and state registry data does not allow this sub-population to be identified."

Methods Fifty-six rats were divided into 4 groups: control diet (C), control diet with tumor (TC), xanthan gum diet (XG), xanthan gum diet with tumor (TXG). Results The ingestion of xanthan gum promotes changes in cytokine content: increasing IL-6 TNF-α and IL-10 in retroperitoneal adipose tissue compared to the control group; and increasing TNF-α in the mesenteric adipose tissue compared to the C and TXG groups. On the contrary, the addition of xanthan gum to the diet did not affect the development of Walker 256 tumors in rats. Conclusion The continuous use of xanthan gum triggered a pro-inflammatory response, promoting an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines in the adipose tissue, but it did not have an effect on the tumor development in the animals inoculated with Walker 256 tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2951321583,"This research quantifies the bias caused in hospital productivity measurements when cost heterogeneity is not considered. A multi-output stochastic cost frontier under a normalised translog specification is used to approximate the structure of technology of a sample of public general hospitals in Spain during the period 2002-2009. To control for observable heterogeneity in costs, a set of variables related to hospital characteristics are included in the cost frontier specification (i.e., hospital complexity, degree of specialisation, availability of outpatient clinics, variety of high-technology equipment available, teaching activity and quality of care), whereas unobservable heterogeneity is accounted for by means of individual dummy variables. A measure of hospitals' cost efficiency is first obtained, and the analysis is then completed by measuring and decomposing the total factor productivity index (TFP-I) change. Findings reveal that controlling for heterogeneity decreases total productivity from an annual average rate of 0.028% to 1.330%, mainly driven by the negative contribution of the cost efficiency change component. Hence, a bias of 1.303 percentage points in the overall TFP-I is found as consequence of not controlling for heterogeneity. In addition to this, if heterogeneity factors are not accounted for, the mean cost efficiency index during the period analysed is 0.730, figure that increases up to 0.974 if heterogeneity is considered. Hence, the omission of heterogeneity leads to a bias of 24.4 percentage points in the mean cost efficiency. Therefore, not adjusting for heterogeneity in costs gives rise to distorted measurements of hospital productivity, as well as distortions in the contribution of each of its components, which may lead to the adoption of inadequate policies and decisions on resource allocation."

We reviewed the obstetric records of singleton pregnant Japanese women who delivered at our institute at ≥ 22 weeks' gestation from 2000 through 2002 and those from 2016 through 2018. From 2000-2002 to 2016-2018, numbers of pregnant women in their twenties decreased and pregnant women in their forties increased significantly (p < 0.01). There were no significant changes in the prevalence of underweight pregnant women between the 2 periods. The prevalence of women whose weight gain during pregnancy was less than optimal increased (p = 0.049). There was no difference in obstetric outcomes between the 2 periods. Based on the current results, we cannot judge the necessity of further education to curb the increasing trend of Japanese women who desire slimness. Maternal weight may not have a high priority as an indicator of the gestational nutritional status associated with obstetric outcomes in Japan."
https://openalex.org/W2953144546,"Hepatitis E virus genotype 3 (HEV-3) is an emerging zoonotic pathogen, responsible for sporadic cases of acute hepatitis E worldwide. Primate models have proven to be an essential tool for the study of HEV pathogenesis. Here we describe the outcomes of HEV infection in Macaca fascicularis (cynomolgus) inoculated experimentally with genotype 3. Eight adult cynomolgus macaques were inoculated intravenously with HEV-3 viral particles isolated from swine and human samples. Liver, spleen, duodenum, gallbladder and bile were sequential assessed up to the end-point of this study, 67 days post-inoculation (dpi). Our previously published findings showed that biochemical parameters return gradually to baseline levels at 55 dpi, whereas anti-HEV IgM and HEV RNA become undetectable in the serum and feces of all animals, indicating a non-viremic phase of recovery. Nevertheless, at a later stage during convalescence (67 dpi), the presence of HEV-3 RNA and antigen persist in central organs, even after peripheral viral clearance. Our results show that two cynomolgus inoculated with swine HEV-3 (animals I3 and O1) presented persistence of HEV RNA low titers in liver, gallbladder and bile. At this same stage of infection, HEV antigen (HEV Ag) could be detected in all infected animals, predominantly in non-reactive Kupffer cells (CD68+iNOS-) and sinusoidal lining cells. Simultaneously, CD4+, CD3+CD4+, and CD3+CD8+ immune cells were identified in hepatic sinusoids and small inflammatory clusters of lobular mononuclear cells, at the end-point of this study. Inability of HEV clearance in humans can result in chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, with subsequent liver failure requiring transplantation. The results of our study support the persistence of HEV-3 during convalescence at 67 dpi, with active immune response in NHP. We alert to the inherent risk of viral transmission through liver transplantation, even in the absence of clinical and biochemical signs of acute infection. Thus, besides checking conventional serological markers of HEV infection, we strongly recommend HEV-3 RNA and antigen detection in liver explants as public health measure to prevent donor-recipient transmission and spread of hepatitis E."
https://openalex.org/W2951738248,"A brain-computer interface (BCI), based on motor imagery EEG, uses information extracted from the electroencephalography signals generated by a person who intends to perform any action. One of the most important issues of current research is how to detect automatically whether the user intends to send some message to a certain device. This study presents a proposal, based on a hierarchical structured system, for recognising intentional and non-intentional mental tasks on a BCI system by applying machine learning techniques to the EEG signals. First-level clustering is performed to distinguish between intentional control (IC) and non-intentional control (NC) state patterns. Then, the patterns recognised as IC are passed on to a second stage where supervised learning techniques are used to classify them. In BCI applications, it is critical to correctly classify NC states with a low false positive rate (FPR) to avoid undesirable effects. According to the literature, we selected a maximum FPR of 10%. Under these conditions, our proposal achieved an average test accuracy of 66.6%, with an 8.2% FPR, for the BCI competition IIIa dataset. The main contribution of this paper is the hierarchical approach, based on machine learning paradigms, which performs intentional and non-intentional discrimination and, depending on the case, classifies the intended command selected by the user."
