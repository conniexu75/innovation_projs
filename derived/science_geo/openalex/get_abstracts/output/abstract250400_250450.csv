https://openalex.org/W2159423849,"Cassini has identified a geologically active province at the south pole of Saturn's moon Enceladus. In images acquired by the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS), this region is circumscribed by a chain of folded ridges and troughs at â¼55Â°S latitude. The terrain southward of this boundary is distinguished by its albedo and color contrasts, elevated temperatures, extreme geologic youth, and narrow tectonic rifts that exhibit coarse-grained ice and coincide with the hottest temperatures measured in the region. Jets of fine icy particles that supply Saturn's E ring emanate from this province, carried aloft by water vapor probably venting from subsurface reservoirs of liquid water. The shape of Enceladus suggests a possible intense heating epoch in the past by capture into a 1:4 secondary spin/orbit resonance."
https://openalex.org/W2108889829,"Until recently, northern Bering Sea ecosystems were characterized by extensive seasonal sea ice cover, high water column and sediment carbon production, and tight pelagic-benthic coupling of organic production. Here, we show that these ecosystems are shifting away from these characteristics. Changes in biological communities are contemporaneous with shifts in regional atmospheric and hydrographic forcing. In the past decade, geographic displacement of marine mammal population distributions has coincided with a reduction of benthic prey populations, an increase in pelagic fish, a reduction in sea ice, and an increase in air and ocean temperatures. These changes now observed on the shallow shelf of the northern Bering Sea should be expected to affect a much broader portion of the Pacific-influenced sector of the Arctic Ocean."
https://openalex.org/W2105729200,"Crop domestication frequently began with the selection of plants that did not naturally shed ripe fruits or seeds. The reduction in grain shattering that led to cereal domestication involved genetic loci of large effect. The molecular basis of this key domestication transition, however, remains unknown. Here we show that human selection of an amino acid substitution in the predicted DNA binding domain encoded by a gene of previously unknown function was primarily responsible for the reduction of grain shattering in rice domestication. The substitution undermined the gene function necessary for the normal development of an abscission layer that controls the separation of a grain from the pedicel."

This kitten state is generated by subtracting one photon from a squeezed vacuum beam, and it clearly presents a negative Wigner function. The predicted influence of the experimental parameters is in excellent agreement with the experimental results. The amplitude of the coherent states can be amplified to transform our “Schrödinger kittens” into bigger Schrödinger cats, providing an essential tool for quantum information processing."
https://openalex.org/W2065588235,"ATR is a key regulator of checkpoint responses to incompletely replicated and damaged DNA, but the mechanisms underlying control of its kinase activity are unknown. TopBP1, the vertebrate homolog of yeast Cut5/Dbp11, has dual roles in initiation of DNA replication and regulation of checkpoint responses. We show that recombinant TopBP1 induces a large increase in the kinase activity of both Xenopus and human ATR. The ATR-activating domain resides in a conserved segment of TopBP1 that is distinct from its numerous BRCT repeats. The isolated ATR-activating domain from TopBP1 induces ectopic activation of ATR-dependent signaling in both Xenopus egg extracts and human cells. Furthermore, Xenopus egg extracts containing a version of TopBP1 with an inactivating point mutation in the ATR-activating domain are defective in checkpoint regulation. These studies establish that activation of ATR by TopBP1 is a crucial step in the initiation of ATR-dependent signaling processes.

In eukaryotic cells, various checkpoint-control mechanisms help to preserve the integrity of the genome (Nyberg et al., 2002Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.A. Toward maintaining the genome: DNA damage and replication checkpoints.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 617-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, Sancar et al., 2004Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Ünsal-Kaçmaz K. Linn S. Molecular mechanisms of mammalian DNA repair and the DNA damage checkpoints.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). Components of these regulatory systems monitor the genome for the presence of damaged or incompletely replicated DNA. Upon detecting key features associated with these DNA structures, checkpoint systems mobilize enzymatic cascades that regulate cell-cycle progression and other critical processes. Members of the phosphoinositide kinase-related family of protein kinases (PIKKs), such as ATM and ATR, are key upstream regulators of checkpoint responses (Abraham, 2001Abraham R.T. Cell cycle checkpoint signaling through the ATM and ATR kinases.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). ATM responds principally to the occurrence of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) in the genome. ATR plays a distinct role in the detection of stalled DNA replication forks, but it also participates in DNA damage responses (Abraham, 2001Abraham R.T. Cell cycle checkpoint signaling through the ATM and ATR kinases.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar, Bakkenist and Kastan, 2004Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Initiating cellular stress responses.Cell. 2004; 118: 9-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Significantly, ATM and ATR depend upon numerous other proteins in order to phosphorylate their downstream targets. For example, one important target of ATR is Chk1, a checkpoint effector kinase that regulates key cell-cycle enzymes such as Cdc25 and Wee1 (Guo et al., 2000Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G.

The ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 requires ATRIP, a binding partner of ATR (Cortez et al., 2001Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 38355-38364Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition, the trimeric Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 (9-1-1) clamp, which depends upon the clamp loader Rad17-RFC for deposition onto recessed DNA ends, is necessary for this process (Sancar et al., 2004Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Ünsal-Kaçmaz K. Linn S. Molecular mechanisms of mammalian DNA repair and the DNA damage checkpoints.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). Moreover, various checkpoint mediator proteins are crucial for the ability of PIKKs to phosphorylate downstream kinases (Nyberg et al., 2002Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.A. Toward maintaining the genome: DNA damage and replication checkpoints.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 617-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, Sancar et al., 2004Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Ünsal-Kaçmaz K. Linn S. Molecular mechanisms of mammalian DNA repair and the DNA damage checkpoints.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2329) Google Scholar). Checkpoint mediator proteins include Claspin and certain proteins that possess BRCA1 carboxy-terminal (BRCT) domains, such as 53BP1 (Kumagai and Dunphy, 2000Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Claspin, a novel protein required for the activation of Chk1 during a DNA replication checkpoint response in Xenopus egg extracts.Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, Canman, 2003Canman C.E. Checkpoint mediators: relaying signals from DNA strand breaks.Curr.

Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30057-30062Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have indicated that Claspin directly facilitates the phosphorylation of Chk1 by ATR (Kumagai et al., 2004Kumagai A. Kim S.-M. Dunphy W.G. Claspin and the activated form of ATR-ATRIP collaborate in the activation of Chk1.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49599-49608Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, accumulating evidence has suggested that the term “mediator,” although useful, understates the complexity of these proteins. For example, Claspin appears to have additional roles in DNA replication and sensing of replication forks (Lee et al., 2003Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Claspin, a Chk1-regulatory protein, monitors DNA replication on chromatin independently of RPA, ATR, and Rad17.Mol.

Roles of replication fork-interacting and Chk1-activating domains from Claspin in a DNA replication checkpoint response.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5269-5282Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, 53BP1 recognizes two features of modified histones, which suggests that its interaction with chromatin is important for some facet of a DNA damage response (see van Attikum and Gasser, 2005van Attikum H. Gasser S.M. The histone code at DNA breaks: a guide to repair?.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 757-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). TopBP1 is another example of a BRCT-containing protein that has been implicated in genomic stability (Garcia et al., 2005Garcia V. Furuya K. Carr A.M. Identification and functional analysis of TopBP1 and its homologs.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2005; 4: 1227-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). It is well known that relatives of TopBP1 in fission yeast (Cut5) and budding yeast (Dbp11) play essential roles in both initiation of DNA replication and checkpoint regulation (Saka and Yanagida, 1993Saka Y.

Identification and functional analysis of TopBP1 and its homologs.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2005; 4: 1227-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Human TopBP1, which was discovered in two-hybrid studies as a topoisomerase IIβ binding protein, has been reported to contain eight BRCT repeats (Yamane et al., 1997Yamane K. Kawabata M. Tsuruo T. A DNA-topoisomerase-II-binding protein with eight repeating regions similar to DNA-repair enzymes and to a cell-cycle regulator.Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Like its yeast counterparts, vertebrate TopBP1 has been implicated in both DNA replication and checkpoint control (Makiniemi et al., 2001Makiniemi M. Hillukkala T. Tuusa J. Reini K. Vaara M. Huang D. Pospiech H. Majuri I. Westerling T. Makela T.P. Syväoja J.E. BRCT domain-containing protein TopBP1 functions in DNA replication and damage response.J. Biol.

Identification and functional analysis of TopBP1 and its homologs.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2005; 4: 1227-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Additionally, a Drosophila homolog called Mus101 appears to possess similar functional properties (Holway et al., 2005Holway A.H. Hung C. Michael W.M. Systematic, RNA-interference-mediated identification of mus-101 modifier genes in Caenorhabditis elegans.Genetics. 2005; 169: 1451-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In humans, there is evidence that TopBP1 also participates in transcriptional regulation and chromatin structure (Garcia et al., 2005Garcia V. Furuya K. Carr A.M. Identification and functional analysis of TopBP1 and its homologs.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2005; 4: 1227-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Although the numerous BRCT repeats of TopBP1 could help to explain its wide-ranging functions, it is not understood how TopBP1 participates in such diverse aspects of DNA metabolism. We have been studying the checkpoint responses to incompletely replicated and damaged DNA in Xenopus egg extracts. In this system, Xenopus ATR (Xatr) carries out the activating phosphorylation of Xenopus Chk1 (Xchk1) in response to stalled DNA replication forks (Kumagai et al., 1998Kumagai A. Guo Z. Emami K.H. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. The Xenopus Chk1 protein kinase mediates a caffeine-sensitive pathway of checkpoint control in cell-free extracts.J.

These components also participate in the detection of various forms of damaged DNA (Kumagai et al., 1998Kumagai A. Guo Z. Emami K.H. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). During these responses, Xatr undergoes a substantial increase in kinase activity (Guo et al., 2000Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. Requirement for Atr in phosphorylation of Chk1 and cell cycle regulation in response to DNA replication blocks and UV-damaged DNA in Xenopus egg extracts.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, Kumagai et al., 2004Kumagai A.

The mediator protein Claspin directly facilitates the phosphorylation of Xchk1 by Xatr (Kumagai et al., 2004Kumagai A. Kim S.-M. Dunphy W.G. Claspin and the activated form of ATR-ATRIP collaborate in the activation of Chk1.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49599-49608Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In the egg-extract system, Xenopus TopBP1 (XtopBP1), also known as Xcut5 and Xmus101, has two overall functions. It is essential for the loading of Cdc45 onto origins of replication and is thus necessary for the initiation of DNA replication (Van Hatten et al., 2002Van Hatten R.A. Tutter A.V. Holway A.H. Khederian A.M. Walter J.C. Michael W.M. The Xenopus Xmus101 protein is required for the recruitment of Cdc45 to origins of DNA replication.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, Hashimoto and Takisawa, 2003Hashimoto Y. Takisawa H. Xenopus Cut5 is essential for a CDK-dependent process in the initiation of DNA replication.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2526-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, it possesses a distinct function in controlling the activation of Xchk1 (Parrilla-Castellar and Karnitz, 2003Parrilla-Castellar E.R. Karnitz L.M. Cut5 is required for the binding of Atr and DNA polymerase alpha to genotoxin-damaged chromatin.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45507-45511Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the exact role that XtopBP1 plays in this process has been unclear. In this report, we have investigated the molecular mechanism by which Xatr-Xatrip undergoes an increase in kinase activity upon induction of checkpoint responses. Our overall goal has been to understand how components at stalled replication forks and sites of DNA damage participate in the activation of Xatr-Xatrip in Xenopus egg extracts and, by extension, of ATR-ATRIP in human cells. In searching for factors that might be involved in this process, we have found that XtopBP1 serves as direct positive effector of Xatr by strongly stimulating its kinase activity. These findings indicate that interaction of Xatr with a critical protein at replication forks and sites of DNA damage induces its activation and thus provide a key insight into how these DNA structures trigger checkpoint responses. We have previously shown that Xatr undergoes a substantial increase in kinase activity in response to checkpoint-inducing DNA templates in Xenopus egg extracts (Guo et al., 2000Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. Requirement for Atr in phosphorylation of Chk1 and cell cycle regulation in response to DNA replication blocks and UV-damaged DNA in Xenopus egg extracts.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, Kumagai et al., 2004Kumagai A. Kim S.-M. Dunphy W.G. Claspin and the activated form of ATR-ATRIP collaborate in the activation of Chk1.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49599-49608Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that Xatr undergoes activation upon interaction with DNA, a DNA-associating protein (or proteins), or both. In assessing various plausible candidates for Xatr-activating factors, we considered the model wherein XtopBP1 might play a direct role in this process. To examine this possibility, we first isolated Xatr from egg extracts by pull-downs with FLAG-tagged Xenopus ATRIP (Xatrip). For these experiments, we used both full-length Xatrip and an N-terminal truncation mutant (ΔN222) that supports normal Xatr-dependent activation of Xchk1 in egg extracts (Kumagai et al., 2004Kumagai A. Kim S.-M. Dunphy W.G. Claspin and the activated form of ATR-ATRIP collaborate in the activation of Chk1.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49599-49608Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, Kim et al., 2005Kim S.M. Kumagai A. Lee J. Dunphy W.G. Phosphorylation of Chk1 by ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) in Xenopus egg extracts requires binding of ATRIP to ATR but not the stable DNA-binding or coiled-coil domains of ATRIP.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38355-38364Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 1A, Xatr bound well to beads containing either wild-type or ΔN222 Xatrip but not to control beads lacking Xatrip. We eluted the beads with FLAG peptide and mixed the eluates with a His6-tagged version of XtopBP1 that had been purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells (Figure 1B). Finally, we added [32P]ATP and PHAS-I, a commonly used model substrate for ATR (Abraham, 2001Abraham R.T. Cell cycle checkpoint signaling through the ATM and ATR kinases.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). As shown in Figure 1C, addition of XtopBP1 induced a very large increase in the kinase activity of both Xatr-Xatrip complexes toward PHAS-I. The Xatr-Xatrip preparations themselves exhibited relatively low kinase activity under these conditions. In addition, the preparation of recombinant XtopBP1 alone contained negligible kinase activity toward PHAS-I. In a dose-response analysis, we observed that half-maximal induction of kinase activity occurred at approximately 10–15 μg/ml XtopBP1 (Figures 1D and 1E). For comparison, the endogenous concentration of XtopBP1 in egg extracts is about 5 μg/ml (Hashimoto and Takisawa, 2003Hashimoto Y. Takisawa H. Xenopus Cut5 is essential for a CDK-dependent process in the initiation of DNA replication.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2526-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In order to establish the specificity of our assay, we carried out similar experiments with egg extracts lacking Xatr. For this purpose, we removed Xatr from the extracts by immunodepletion with anti-Xatr antibodies. In parallel, we prepared mock-depleted extracts with control antibodies. Next, we incubated recombinant XatripΔN222-FLAG in mock-depleted and Xatr-depleted extracts in the presence of anti-FLAG beads. We reisolated the beads, eluted with FLAG peptide, added His6-XtopBP1, and assayed kinase activity toward PHAS-I. As expected, Xatr was present in the preparation from mock-depleted but not from Xatr-depleted extracts (Figure 2A). We observed that His6-XtopBP1 could not elicit any kinase activity toward PHAS-I in the preparation from Xatr-depleted extracts (Figures 2A and 2B). By contrast, consistent with the results described above, His6-XtopBP1 induced strong kinase activity in the preparation from mock-depleted extracts. These findings indicate that the induced kinase activity is due to Xatr. We also characterized the sensitivity of the XtopBP1-activated form of Xatr to caffeine, a documented inhibitor of ATR in numerous organisms (Abraham, 2001Abraham R.T. Cell cycle checkpoint signaling through the ATM and ATR kinases.Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). As shown in Figures 2C and 2D, caffeine inhibited the activated form of Xatr very effectively, with half-maximal inhibition occurring at approximately 0.4 mM. This concentration is comparable to that previously reported for inhibition of both human and Xenopus ATR (Sarkaria et al., 1999Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Inhibition of ATM and ATR kinase activities by the radiosensitizing agent, caffeine.Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar, Guo et al., 2000Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X.

Next, we performed structure-function studies in order to identify which part of XtopBP1 is responsible for the activation of Xatr. For this purpose, we produced a series of overlapping GST fusion proteins containing approximately 300–350 amino acids from XtopBP1. Both human TopBP1 and XtopBP1 are relatively large proteins that contain approximately 1500 amino acids. XtopBP1, like human TopBP1, has been reported to contain eight BRCT repeats (Yamane et al., 1997Yamane K. Kawabata M. Tsuruo T.

Xenopus Cut5 is essential for a CDK-dependent process in the initiation of DNA replication.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2526-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Four expression constructs were designed to contain two adjoining BRCT repeats each (e.g., residues 1–348, 333–646, 623–984, and 1197–1513) as designated in Figure 3A. In addition, we also prepared a GST fusion protein containing a conserved region between BRCT domains VI and VII (residues 972–1279). Upon incubation with Xatr-Xatrip, we observed that the 972–1279 peptide induced activation of Xatr as effectively as full-length XtopBP1 (Figure 3B). By contrast, none of the BRCT-containing fusion proteins had any effect on the activity of Xatr. We also found that a similar fragment of human TopBP1 (residues 978–1192) from between BRCT domains VI and VII likewise activated Xatr-Xatrip very effectively (Figure 3C). Therefore, the ATR-activating function is conserved in both Xenopus and human TopBP1. In order to pursue these observations further, we produced a full-length version of XtopBP1 in which most of the ATR-activating domain had been deleted (the Δ993–1196 mutant) (Figure 3D). In contrast to the full-length protein, the XtopBP1Δ993–1196 mutant protein displayed no Xatr-activating capacity (Figure 3E). Therefore, a conserved segment of XtopBP1 between BRCT domains VI and VII appears to be both necessary and sufficient for activation of Xatr. To extend our analyses, we also examined two documented physiological substrates of Xatr, namely Xenopus Mcm2 (Xmcm2) and Xchk1 (Guo et al., 2000Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G.

For Xmcm2, we used the GST-Xmcm2(62–122) fusion peptide, in which S92 is a target for Xatr (Yoo et al., 2004Yoo H.Y. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G.

In the case of Xchk1, we used both the whole protein (Xchk1-Myc-His6) and a GST fusion peptide from its regulatory domain (residues 306–352) that contains S344, the major phosphorylation site for Xatr (Guo et al., 2000Guo Z.

For these experiments, we used the GST-XtopBP1(972–1279) fragment as the activator of Xatr. We found that the XtopBP1 fragment induced a strong Xatr-dependent phosphorylation of the GST-Xmcm2(62–122) peptide (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). This phosphorylation occurred on S92 because there was no 32P incorporation into the S92A mutant of this peptide. Similarly, we observed that the XtopBP1 fragment readily induced phosphorylation of both the GST-Xchk1(306–352) peptide and full-length Xchk1-Myc-His6 on S344 (Figure S1). These experiments establish that XtopBP1 strongly stimulates the ability of Xatr to phosphorylate a variety of different substrates. Furthermore, our results imply that the increased phosphorylation is due to elevated kinase activity rather than XtopBP1-mediated tethering of Xatr to substrates because we have observed this effect with two different small peptides approximately 50–60 residues in length as well as a model substrate protein (PHAS-I). It seems implausible that all of these substrates could be using XtopBP1 as an adaptor protein. However, our observations do not rule out the possibility that TopBP1 could play an additional role in recognition of intact physiological substrates apart from the process that we have characterized in this paper. As another means to examine the specificity of this activation process, we asked whet"

Early endosomes have been considered as the initial sorting station where cargos for degradation separate from those for recycling. Using live-cell imaging to monitor individual endosomes and ligand particles in real time, we have discovered a sorting mechanism that takes place prior to early endosome entry. We show that early endosomes are in fact comprised of two distinct populations: a dynamic population that is highly mobile on microtubules and matures rapidly toward late endosomes and a static population that matures much more slowly. Several cargos destined for degradation are preferentially targeted to the dynamic endosomes, whereas the recycling ligand transferrin is nonselectively delivered to all early endosomes and effectively enriched in the larger, static population.

Proper sorting of proteins and lipids is essential for many cellular activities. Internalized nutrients must be targeted to different organelles for processing, and newly synthesized proteins are directed to specific cellular locations for function. A primary function of the endocytic system is to sort internalized ligands and receptors to different destinations (Trowbridge et al., 1993Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R.

Early endosomes, also referred to as the sorting endosomes, have traditionally been considered as the initial sorting stations, where cargos destined for recycling begin to separate from those bound for degradation (Yamashiro and Maxfield, 1987Yamashiro D.J.

Transferrin, LDL, and EGF are all believed to first enter a common pool of early endosomes where sorting takes place (Dickson et al., 1983Dickson R.B. Hanover J.A. Willingham M.C. Pastan I.

While research efforts have mainly focused on understanding the sorting occurring in early endosomes, a fundamental question remains open as to whether the sorting of endocytic cargos between recycling and degradation pathways may begin even before entering early endosomes. Recently, it has been found that different endocytic receptors require different adaptor proteins for endocytosis (Schmid, 1997Schmid S.L. Clathrin-coated vesicle formation and protein sorting.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 511-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, Traub, 2003Traub L.M. Sorting it out: AP-2 and alternate clathrin adaptors in endocytic cargo selection.J.

Cargo recognition during clathrin-mediated endocytosis: a team effort.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, the significance of the diversity of adaptor proteins and how these adaptors might direct endocytic sorting remains unclear. As the endocytic system is comprised of a highly dynamic network of vesicles and endosomes, monitoring the evolution of this network in real time is crucial for a better understanding of intracellular trafficking. In this work, we observed the trafficking of endocytic ligands by real-time tracking of the interactions between individual cargo particles and endosomes in live cells. We show that early endosomes are not made of a uniform pool of endocytic compartments nondiscriminatively accepting all internalized cargos but instead are comprised of two populations with distinct mobility and maturation kinetics. Surprisingly, ligands including transferrin, LDL, EGF, and influenza virus, which all enter cells primarily via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, are differentially trafficked into these two populations: those ligands destined for degradation are preferentially targeted to the small population of dynamic, rapidly maturing early endosomes, whereas the recycling ligand transferrin is nonselectively targeted to all early endosomes and effectively enriched in the larger population of static, slowly maturing early endosomes. This preearly endosome sorting begins at the plasma membrane and depends on the composition and motility of endocytic vesicles. Rab GTPases are specifically localized to different intracellular organelles (Zerial and McBride, 2001Zerial M. McBride H. Rab proteins as membrane organizers.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 107-119Google Scholar, Pfeffer and Aivazian, 2004Pfeffer S. Aivazian D. Targeting RAB GTPases to distinct membrane compartments.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 886-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). For example, Rab5 and Rab7 primarily associate with early and late endosomes, respectively, and Rab11 is a recycling endosome marker, though small amounts of Rab11 were also found in early endosomes and Golgi (Chavrier et al., 1990Chavrier P.

In order to visualize early and late endosomes, we coexpressed Rab5 and Rab7, fused to cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins (ECFP and EYFP), respectively, in BS-C-1 cells. ECFP-Rab5 shows discrete spots primarily distributed in the cell periphery; EYFP-Rab7 spots are more common in the perinuclear region (see Movie S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). While most of the Rab5-positive endosomes show only the Rab5 signal, a small fraction (∼14%) contains partially overlapping domains of Rab5 and Rab7. We interpret the former as early endosomes and the latter as transient intermediates, which are maturing toward late endosomes (Stoorvogel et al., 1991Stoorvogel W. Strous G.J. Geuze H.J. Oorschot V.

Indeed, the Rab5-only endosomes show 80% colocalization with early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1; Figure 1A) but only 10% colocalization with a late endosome marker, the cation-independent mannose phosphate receptor (CI-MPR; Figure 1B). In contrast, 57% of the endosomes that contain both Rab5 and Rab7 overlap with CI-MPR (Figure 1B). Substantial overexpression of Rab5 was previously shown to cause pronounced enlargement of early endosomes and their redistribution to the perinuclear region (Nielsen et al., 1999Nielsen E. Severin F. Backer J.M. Hyman A.A. Zerial M. Rab 5 regulates motility of early endosomes on microtubules.Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). In our experiments, ECFP-Rab5 was expressed at sufficiently low levels such that the enlargement and redistribution of endosomes were not observed. The expression of ECFP-Rab5 and EYFP-Rab7 also did not affect the internalization and postendocytic trafficking kinetics of endocytic ligands (Figures S1 and S2). Next, we tracked early endosomes that initially carry Rab5 and observed the change of their Rab content in real time (Figures 1C and 1D; Movies S2 and S3). Surprisingly, we observed two distinct populations of early endosomes: about 35% of Rab5-positive endosomes either mature rapidly by accumulating Rab7 with a time constant of 30 s or already carry Rab7 at the beginning of our observation; the remaining 65% mature on a much slower time scale, not acquiring Rab7 even after 100 s (Figure 1E). The accumulation of Rab7 mostly occurs gradually (Figure 1D). The maturation kinetics are identical between cells maintained at 37°C and cells that have just experienced a temperature jump from 0°C to 37°C (Figure S3). The maturation rate of early endosomes is highly correlated with their mobility along microtubules (Figure 1F). The rapidly maturing population shows significantly higher mobility and exhibits directed movement, demonstrated by a mean-square-displacement analysis of the endosome trajectories (Figure S4). In contrast, the slowly maturing population is much less mobile. The mobility of the rapidly maturing population is reduced to the level of the slowly maturing endosomes by treatment with the microtubule-disrupting drug nocodazole (Figure 1F), indicating that the rapidly maturing population is actively transported on microtubules whereas the slowly maturing population is not. Some of the slowly maturing endosomes eventually acquire Rab7 before significant photobleaching begins to interfere with imaging. Shortly before Rab7 accumulation, the mobility of these endosomes typically increases to a level similar to that of the rapidly maturing population (data not shown), suggesting that the two observed populations may represent two different stages in the life cycle of early endosomes. The existence of two populations of early endosomes naturally raises the question of whether these populations are functionally distinct. To address this, we used real-time, three-color imaging to track individual cargo particles as they entered Rab-labeled endosomes. We first tested the trafficking of cargos destined for degradation, including LDL, EGF, and influenza virus. LDL delivers cholesterol into cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Anderson et al., 1977Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Role of the coated endocytic vesicle in the uptake of receptor-bound low density lipoprotein in human fibroblasts.Cell. 1977; 10: 351-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether the two populations of early endosomes are equally efficient in accepting LDL, we imaged the uptake of fluorescently labeled LDL in live cells. Remarkably, the great majority of internalized LDL is directly targeted to the dynamic, rapidly maturing endosomes (Figure 2A; Movie S4). Even though this population represents only 35% of all early endosomes, 80% of LDL particles are directed to these structures (Figure 2B). In particular, 53% of LDL particles are delivered to endosomes that already contain both Rab5 and Rab7, indicating that LDL is indeed preferentially targeted to this population instead of stimulating the acquisition of Rab7. The delivery of LDL to dynamic endosomes often occurs soon after the LDL-carrying vesicle undergoes microtubule-dependent transport (Figure 2C). EGF primarily enters cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis when added at low concentrations (Carpenter and Cohen, 1979Carpenter G. Cohen S. Epidermal growth-factor.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 193-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At high concentrations, some EGF molecules are diverted to other pathways (Jiang and Sorkin, 2003Jiang X. Sorkin A.

At the concentration used here, we found that EGF clusters into discrete structures on the cell surface, and nearly all of these clusters colocalize with clathrin-coated pits before entry (data not shown). Much like LDL, upon internalization, EGF is preferentially targeted directly to the dynamic, rapidly maturing population of early endosomes (86%) with only a small fraction (14%) joining the static, slowly maturing endosomes. Influenza virus enters cells by multiple endocytic mechanisms (Matlin et al., 1981Matlin K.S. Reggio H. Helenius A. Simons K.

Uncoating of influenza virus in endosomes.J. Virol. 1984; 51: 497-504PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that influenza virus primarily enters cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (65%), with a small fraction (35%) entering via a clathrin- and caveolin-independent pathway (Rust et al., 2004Rust M.J. Lakadamyali M. Zhang F. Zhuang X. Assembly of endocytic machinery around individual influenza viruses during viral entry.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). To observe the trafficking of influenza, we added DiD-labeled virus particles to cells in situ while imaging at 37°C. Like LDL, the virus particles are preferentially directed to the dynamic population of early endosomes (Figures 3A and 3B; Movie S5). Again, the majority of virus particles joins endosomes after the onset of microtubule-dependent transport (Figures 3C and 3D). This is also consistent with our previous observation that the virus particles experience their initial acidification to pH 6 (early endosome pH) after the onset of microtubule-dependent transport (Lakadamyali et al., 2003Lakadamyali M. Rust M.J. Babcock H.P. Zhuang X. Visualizing infection of individual influenza viruses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 9280-9285Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Viral fusion events are identified by fluorescence dequenching due to spreading of DiD into the larger endosomal membrane (Figure 3A; Movie S5; Lakadamyali et al., 2003Lakadamyali M. Rust M.J. Babcock H.P. Zhuang X. Visualizing infection of individual influenza viruses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 9280-9285Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the majority of fusion events (72%) occur in maturing endosomes when both Rab5 and Rab7 are present (Figure 3A). Transferrin delivers iron to cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Hopkins and Trowbridge, 1983Hopkins C.R. Trowbridge I.S. Internalization and processing of transferrin and the transferrin receptor in human carcinoma A431 cells.J. Cell Biol. 1983; 97: 508-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Internalized transferrin was previously believed to initially follow the same path taken by LDL, entering a common set of early endosomes before being recycled to the plasma membrane (Dunn et al., 1989Dunn K.W. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. Iterative fractionation of recycling receptors from lysosomally destined ligands in an early sorting endosome.J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3303-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, Ghosh et al., 1994Ghosh R.N. Gelman D.L. Maxfield F.R. Quantification of low density lipoprotein and transferrin endocytic sorting in HEp2 cells using confocal microscopy.J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, our real-time tracking of transferrin indicates that the initial trafficking of transferrin is drastically different from that of LDL. Transferrin shows more than 90% colocalization with all Rab5-positive endosomes after uptake (Figure 4A). In single-particle tracking experiments, transferrin-carrying vesicles, which initially exhibit no detectable Rab5 signal, are nondiscriminately delivered to both populations of early endosomes (Figures 4B and 4C). Since the static, slowly maturing endosomes constitute a larger population than the dynamic, rapidly maturing ones, the effective result is that most of the transferrin molecules are delivered to the static population. This difference in transferrin and LDL trafficking is quantitatively consistent with the global distributions of these ligands obtained in cells expressing (or not expressing) fluorescent Rab proteins by using Rab5 and Rab7 (or EEA1 and CI-MPR) as the endosome markers (Figure S5). The results are also independent of whether or not a low-temperature ligand binding step was employed prior to uptake. In cells expressing EYFP-Rab11, a recycling endosome marker, transferrin molecules were observed to join Rab11-positive endosomes (Figure 4D; Movie S6), indicating that they were indeed delivered to the recycling pathway. Drugs interfering with recycling, such as wortmannin and neomycin, substantially reduce the percentage of transferrin spots colocalizing with Rab11 (data not shown). Besides going through the recycling endosomes, transferrin can also take a direct recycling pathway back to the cell surface (Sheff et al., 1999Sheff D.R. Daro E.A. Hull M. Mellman I. The receptor recycling pathways contains two distinct populations of early endosomes with different sorting function.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 123-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, Sheff et al., 2002Sheff D. Pelletier L. O'Connell C.B. Warren G. Mellman I. Transferrin receptor recycling in the absence of perinuclear recycling endosomes.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Typically within minutes (96 ± 44 s on average) of association with Rab11, the transferrin spot forms tubular structures and breaks up into optically resolvable smaller vesicles (Figure 4D; Movie S6), indicating tubular segments of endosomes pinching off to recycle transferrin back to the cell surface (Sonnichsen et al., 2000Sonnichsen B. De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. Distinct membrane domains on endosomes in the recycling pathway visualized by multicolor imaging of Rab4, Rab5 and Rab11.J.

Rab conversion as a mechanism of progression from early to late endosome.Cell. 2005; 122: 735-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, such tubulation behavior was not observed for ligands destined to degradation, such as LDL or EGF. The tubulation of transferrin was observed from both static and dynamic early endosomes, including those containing both Rab5 and Rab7, suggesting that transferrin can be recycled from both endosome populations. The acidity of the early endosome (∼pH 6) is important for its ability to sort cargos between degradation and recycling pathways (Mellman et al., 1986Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Acidification of the endocytic and exocytic pathways.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To observe the initial entry of cargo into an acidic endosome, we tracked influenza virus particles labeled with pH-sensitive dyes (Lakadamyali et al., 2003Lakadamyali M. Rust M.J. Babcock H.P. Zhuang X. Visualizing infection of individual influenza viruses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 9280-9285Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The initial acidification step coincides with viral entry into a Rab5-positive endosome (Figures 3E and 3F), indicating that prior to the association with Rab5, the cargo did not join any acidic endosome. In addition, treatment with ammonium chloride to raise endosome pH did not affect the differential sorting of LDL and transferrin into the dynamic and static populations of early endosomes (Figure 5A), indicating that this pre-early endosome sorting is pH independent, unlike the sorting process occurring inside the early endosomes. An important difference between the two populations of early endosomes is that the rapidly maturing endosomes are highly mobile along microtubules while the slowly maturing ones are largely stationary. This, together with the observation that LDL and influenza mostly join early endosomes after the onset of microtubule-dependent transport, suggests that microtubules may play an important role in preferentially targeting these cargos to the dynamic, rapidly maturing endosome population. This is strongly supported by the observation that treatment with nocodazole to disrupt microtubules resulted in LDL and influenza nonselectively joining all early endosomes, just like transferrin (Figure 5B). We infer from these results that endocytic vesicles with microtubule-dependent motility will be preferentially delivered to dynamic, rapidly maturing endosomes which are also moving on mic"

Complement fragments deposited on the particle surface serve as targets for complement receptors present on phagocytic cells. Although Kupffer cells, the liver resident macrophages, play a dominant role in clearing particles in circulation, complement receptors involved in this process have yet to be identified. Here we report the identification and characterization of a Complement Receptor of the Immunoglobulin superfamily, CRIg, that binds complement fragments C3b and iC3b. CRIg expression on Kupffer cells is required for efficient binding and phagocytosis of complement C3-opsonized particles. In turn, Kupffer cells from CRIg-deficient mice are unable to efficiently clear C3-opsonized pathogens in the circulation, resulting in increased infection and mortality of the host. CRIg therefore represents a dominant component of the phagocytic system responsible for rapid clearance of C3-opsonized particles from the circulation."

On the third and closest flyby, on 14 July 2005, multiple Cassini instruments detected evidence for ongoing endogenic activity in a region centered on Enceladus' south pole. The polar region is the source of a plume of gas and dust, which probably emanates from prominent warm troughs seen on the surface. Cassini's Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) detected 3 to 7 gigawatts of thermal emission from the south polar troughs at temperatures up to 145 kelvin or higher, making Enceladus only the third known solid planetary body-after Earth and Io-that is sufficiently geologically active for its internal heat to be detected by remote sensing. If the plume is generated by the sublimation of water ice and if the sublimation source is visible to CIRS, then sublimation temperatures of at least 180 kelvin are required."

In contrast to other C. elegans nuclear receptors, a considerable amount of genetic evidence supports the existence of a steroid-like ligand for the orphan receptor, DAF-12. daf-12 belongs to a group of over 30 genes, collectively called daf (dauer formation) genes, which transduce environmental signals that influence the choice between alternative developmental programs of dauer diapause or reproductive development (Antebi et al., 2000Antebi A. Yeh W.H. Tait D. Hedgecock E.M. Riddle D.L. daf-12 encodes a nuclear receptor that regulates the dauer diapause and developmental age in C. elegans.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1512-1527PubMed Google Scholar, Riddle and Albert, 1997Riddle D.L.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Colds Spring Harbor, NY1997: 739-768Google Scholar). Dauer diapause occurs when second-larval-stage animals (L2) delay further reproductive development under conditions of diminishing food or overcrowding and instead form the nonfeeding, nonreproductive, and long-lived dauer larva (Riddle and Albert, 1997Riddle D.L. Albert P.S. Genetic and environmental regulation of dauer larva development.in: Riddle D.L. Meyer B. Priess J. Blumenthal T. C. elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Colds Spring Harbor, NY1997: 739-768Google Scholar). Under more favorable conditions, dauer larvae resume feeding and reproductive growth. Mutations in Daf genes generally produce a dauer-constitutive phenotype (Daf-c) or a dauer-defective phenotype (Daf-d). Daf-c mutants always arrest as dauers, while Daf-d mutants bypass dauer, regardless of environmental signals. Loss of daf-12 results in Daf-d as well as L3 stage heterochronic phenotypes, indicating that daf-12 is required for dauer formation and for proper developmental timing in the reproductive state (Antebi et al., 1998Antebi A.

Analysis of Daf genes has revealed that favorable environments activate insulin/IGF-1 and TGFβ signaling pathways within the organism that converge on DAF-12 to inhibit its dauer-promoting function and activate its reproductive function (Kimura et al., 1997Kimura K.D.

Acting cell nonautonomously, these pathways are believed to directly or indirectly stimulate the production of a DAF-12 ligand by the cytochrome P450, DAF-9 (Gerisch et al., 2001Gerisch B. Weitzel C.

DAF-9, a cytochrome P450 regulating C. elegans larval development and adult longevity.Development. 2002; 129: 221-231PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence for this model stems from the findings that insulin-like receptor (daf-2), TGFβ (daf-7), and cytochrome P450 (daf-9) signaling mutants are Daf-c and act upstream of daf-12 (Vowels and Thomas, 1992Vowels J.J.

Cell. 2001; 1: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In addition, Daf-c mutants of daf-12 have been isolated that map to a single residue (R564) in the putative ligand binding domain of DAF-12 and are predicted to perturb ligand binding (Antebi et al., 2000Antebi A. Yeh W.H. Tait D. Hedgecock E.M. Riddle D.L. daf-12 encodes a nuclear receptor that regulates the dauer diapause and developmental age in C. elegans.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1512-1527PubMed Google Scholar). Phenotypically, these mutants arrest as partial dauers but recover and resemble weak daf-9 alleles that exhibit gonadal migration (Mig) defects (Gerisch et al., 2001Gerisch B. Weitzel C.

DAF-9, a cytochrome P450 regulating C. elegans larval development and adult longevity.Development. 2002; 129: 221-231PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the predicted loss of hormone production in daf-9 null worms or loss of hormone binding by daf-12 Daf-c worms results in the failure to inhibit dauer-promoting functions and activate L3 stage reproductive functions of DAF-12. Several lines of evidence suggest that DAF-12 ligands may be derived from cholesterol and function as either endocrine or paracrine hormones. First, C. elegans lacks the ability to synthesize cholesterol (Chitwood, 1999Chitwood D.J. Biochemistry and function of nematode steroids.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 273-284Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and cholesterol deprivation produces Mig and Daf-c phenotypes (Gerisch et al., 2001Gerisch B. Weitzel C. Kober-Eisermann C. Rottiers V.

Second, worms missing both homologs (ncr-1, ncr-2) of the human Niemann-Pick type C1 gene, a membrane glycoprotein implicated in cholesterol transport, arrest constitutively as dauers (Li et al., 2004Li J. Brown G. Ailion M. Lee S. Thomas J.H.

Furthermore, recent evidence shows lipid extracts from wild-type worms can rescue daf-9 phenotypes (Gill et al., 2004Gill M.S. Held J.M. Fisher A.L. Gibson B.W. Lithgow G.J. Lipophilic regulator of a developmental switch in Caenorhabditis elegans.Aging Cell. 2004; 3: 413-421Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Finally, unlike DAF-12, DAF-9 functions non-cell autonomously and is restricted to a few cell types such as XXX cells, which are believed to be neuroendocrine cells and a main source of DAF-12 ligands (Ohkura et al., 2003Ohkura K. Suzuki N. Ishihara T. Katsura I. SDF-9, a protein tyrosine phosphatase-like molecule, regulates the L3/dauer developmental decision through hormonal signaling in C. elegans.Development. 2003; 130: 3237-3248Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although these findings support the hypothesis that a sterol-derived hormone promotes reproductive development in C. elegans, the identities of DAF-9-derived hormonal ligands that activate DAF-12 have remained elusive. In this study, we identified a group of 3-keto-sterols that serve as DAF-9 substrates and are metabolized through successive oxidation to produce DAF-12 ligands. These ligands rescue the Daf-c phenotypes displayed by mutations in daf-9, daf-2, daf-7, and ncr-1;ncr-2. Finally, fractionation of C. elegans lipid extracts shows that these metabolites exist in vivo but are absent in daf-9 null worms. These data provide unequivocal evidence for the existence of nematode hormones and demonstrate the evolutionary conservation of broad aspects of endocrine steroid signaling from worms to human. DAF-12 ligand screening was performed using a chimeric GAL4-DAF-12 cotransfection assay in HEK293 cells. Assays were performed in the presence or absence of cotransfected DAF-9, based on genetic evidence suggesting its requirement for synthesis of the DAF-12 ligand (Gerisch and Antebi, 2004Gerisch B.

This screen identified 3-keto-lithocholic acid (3K-LCA, Figure 1A) as a weak activator of DAF-12 independent of DAF-9 (Figure 1B). Lithocholic acid (LCA), which differs from 3K-LCA by an α-hydroxyl group at C-3, did not exhibit activity on its own or in the presence of cotransfected DAF-9 (Figure 1B). These results suggested that a C-3 ketone was required for DAF-12 activation by 3K-LCA. No other bile acids or steroids tested activated DAF-12, including cholic acid (CA), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), deoxycholic acid (DCA), 6-keto-lithocholic acid (6K-LCA), 7-keto-lithocholic acid (7K-LCA), progesterone, pregnenolone, testosterone, estradiol, corticosterone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and 20-hydroxyecdysone (Figure 1B and data not shown). The above data suggested that endogenous 3-keto-sterols from C. elegans are candidate DAF-12 ligands.

Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 172-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), while worms grown only in the presence of lophenol constitutively entered dauer diapause (Matyash et al., 2004Matyash V. Entchev E.V. Mende F. Wilsch-Brauninger M. Thiele C. Schmidt A.W. Knolker H.J. Ward S. Kurzchalia T.V. Sterol-derived hormone(s) controls entry into diapause in Caenorhabditis elegans by consecutive activation of DAF-12 and DAF-16.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: e280https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.0020280Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These studies suggest lathosterol but not lophenol may be a direct precursor to the DAF-12 ligand. Therefore, we tested lathosterol and lophenol along with their respective 3-keto derivatives, lathosterone and lophenone, for activity in the cotransfection assay. Upon cotransfection with DAF-9, activation of DAF-12 was markedly increased by lathosterone (433-fold) and lophenone (103-fold), but not by their respective 3β-hydroxy derivatives (Figure 1C). In addition, 4-cholesten-3-one, a natural oxidation product of cholesterol, activated DAF-12 (109-fold) in the presence of DAF-9 (Figure 1C). Unlike 3K-LCA, activation of DAF-12 by lathosterone, lophenone, and 4-cholesten-3-one required the presence of DAF-9. Structurally, 3K-LCA differs from these 3-keto-sterols in the length and oxidation state of the side chain and in the saturation of the sterol nucleus (Figure 1A). These results suggest that DAF-9 converts 3-keto-sterols, possibly through side chain oxidation, into DAF-12 activators. To determine whether the 3-keto-sterol metabolites were biologically relevant we tested their ability to rescue the Daf-c and Mig phenotypes of daf-9 null animals (Albert and Riddle, 1988Albert P.S.

DAF-9, a cytochrome P450 regulating C. elegans larval development and adult longevity.Development. 2002; 129: 221-231PubMed Google Scholar). Individual 3-keto sterols or their respective 3β-hydroxy sterols were incubated with Sf9 cell microsomes containing DAF-9 and the human P450 oxidoreductase (hOR), which we refer to in all future experiments as DAF-9 microsomes. As a control, microsomes from cells expressing hOR alone were used. For rescue experiments we utilized daf-9(dh6)dhEx24 worms, which carry an unstable extrachromosomal array of daf-9(+) linked to the nuclear marker sur-5::gfp (Gerisch et al., 2001Gerisch B. Weitzel C. Kober-Eisermann C. Rottiers V. Antebi A. A hormonal signaling pathway influencing C. elegans metabolism, reproductive development, and life span.Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 841-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The progeny of these animals, which contain a mixture of both daf-9(+) and daf-9(−) worms, were treated with the microsomal extracts for 48 hr. daf-9(−) worms were then isolated and scored 24 hr later for presence of the dauer phenotype. Extracts from DAF-9 microsomes incubated with either 4-cholesten-3-one or lathosterone resulted in 100% rescue of the Daf-c and Mig phenotypes in daf-9(−) animals (Figure 1D). Remarkably, these animals were indistinguishable from wild-type adults. Indeed, they bypassed dauer, exhibited normal gonadal migration, and produced all Daf-c progeny upon passage to plates lacking microsomal extracts. Rescue by 4-cholesten-3-one and lathosterone required conversion by DAF-9, since their incubation with control microsomes did not rescue any daf-9 phenotypes (data not shown). Extracts from DAF-9 microsomes incubated with lathosterol (which does not contain a 3-keto group) partially rescued (83%) the Daf-c phenotype, but these animals were Mig and sterile (Figure 1D). This effect also required DAF-9 and was not seen using control microsomes (data not shown). Finally, although incubation of lophenone with DAF-9 microsomes resulted in rescue of Daf-c, none of these animals were normal (58% were Mig; 42% failed to enter dauer, had molting defects, or were dead; Figure 1D). This effect was dependent on DAF-9 and the C-3 ketone in lophenone, since no effect was seen using lophenol or control microsomes. Also, no effects were seen using cholesterol as a substrate. Altogether, these assays revealed that DAF-9 microsomes convert 4-cholesten-3-one and lathosterone into activities that completely rescued daf-9 null animals. The data above suggested that DAF-9 has enzymatic activity that converts 4-cholesten-3-one and lathosterone into DAF-12 ligands. Although the absolute potency of these DAF-9 products could not be determined using the rescue assay, dose-response curves from the cotransfection assay revealed that lathosterone metabolites were either significantly more potent or more abundantly produced than 4-cholesten-3-one metabolites (Figure 1E). To identify these DAF-9 products, we utilized liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The 3-keto-Δ4-enone structure present in 4-cholesten-3-one has significant UV absorbance at 240 nm, permitting detection of the metabolites. Incubation of 4-cholesten-3-one with DAF-9 microsomes yielded two new peaks at 240 nm that were not present in the control microsomes (Figure 2A). These products eluted at 4.0 (peak 1) and 5.5 (peak 2) minutes on a reverse phase C18 column, raising the possibility that they were oxidized derivatives of 4-cholesten-3-one, which elutes at 12.5 min (Figure 2A). Since lathosterone is not UV active, its DAF-9 metabolites were scanned in negative-ion mode, revealing two peaks that were not present in the control microsome reactions. DAF-9 products of lathosterone eluted much earlier than lathosterone at 4.0 and 4.2 min (peaks 3 and 4), analogous to the pattern seen for 4-cholesten-3-one (Figure 2B and data not shown). Fractions from DAF-9 microsomal reactions subjected to reverse-phase HPLC were also tested for DAF-12 activation and rescue of daf-9 null animals (Figures 2C–2F). Fractions corresponding to peaks 1–4 (i.e., the 4-cholesten-3-one and lathosterone derivatives) activated DAF-12 several hundred-fold in the absence of cotransfected DAF-9 (Figures 2C and 2D) and rescued daf-9 null animals (Figures 2E and 2F). Again, the lathosterone derivatives were stronger at activating DAF-12 and rescuing daf-9, suggesting these compounds may be more abundant, potent, or efficacious. Next, we utilized LC/MS as a first step in the identification of the activities in peaks 1–4. Based on the molecular weight of 4-cholesten-3-one ([M + H]+ m/z = 385) and the retention times and mass spectra of the new compounds, peak 2 is consistent with a monohydroxylated derivative of 4-cholesten-3-one ([M + H]+ m/z = 401) and peak 1 is consistent with a carboxylic acid derivative ([M + H]+ m/z = 415) (Figure 2G). Further evidence that peak 1 represented a carboxylic acid derivative was found after a negative-ion scan in which a unique peak at 4.0 min was found only in the DAF-9 microsomes with a base peak at m/z 413 (Figure 2G). Peak 4, which was scanned in negative ion mode, yielded similar mass spectra to peak 1, consistent with the conclusion that peak 4 is the carboxylic acid derivative of lathosterone (Figure 2H). Finally, peak 3 contained one DAF-9-specific product at m/z 415 (Figure 2H). Although the identity of this peak remains unknown, the activity we observed in fractions 4 and 5 (from Figures 2B and 2D) tracks predominantly with peak 4 and not peak 3 (see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). The finding that 3K-LCA was a weak activator of DAF-12 suggested that the position of oxidation of DAF-9 metabolites was on the side chain. The commercial availability of monohydroxylated derivatives of cholesterol permitted us to focus on defining the site of oxidation on the 4-cholesten-3-one metabolites of DAF-9. A panel of side chain oxidized 4-cholesten-3-one derivatives was generated by converting 5-cholesten-3β-ol (ring A, 3β-hydroxy-Δ5) oxysterols (20(S)-OH-, 22(R)-OH-, 22(S)-OH-, 24-OH-, 25-OH-, (25R),26-OH-, and (25S),26-OH-cholesterol) into their respective 4-cholesten-3-one (ring B, 3-keto-Δ4) oxysterols using cholesterol oxidase (Figure 3A). When tested in the cotransfection assay without DAF-9, two diastereomers of 26-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one ((25S),26-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and (25R),26-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one) were strongly active (Figure 3B). In contrast, the ring A oxysterols were inactive, confirming the idea that DAF-12 ligands require a 3-keto group. Chromatographic separation of the ring B oxysterols and comparison to the 4-cholesten-3-one metabolites of DAF-9 resolved peak 2 (Figure 2A) into two peaks that coeluted with the diastereomers of 26-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (Figure 3C). These results revealed that DAF-9 is a nonstereoselective 4-cholesten-3-one 26-hydroxylase. Given that DAF-9 microsomes produced both hydroxylated and carboxylated metabolites of 4-cholesten-3-one, we investigated whether DAF-9 oxidizes 4-cholesten-3-one at C-26 to produce both diastereomers of 26-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and their corresponding carboxylic acids. Indeed, incubation of either (25S) or (25R),26-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one with DAF-9 microsomes resulted in the production of a single UV active peak at 4 min and m/z 415 in positive-ion mode (Figure 3D). This retention time and mass spectral property were identical to the carboxylated metabolite found after incubation 4-cholesten-3-one with DAF-9 microsomes (Figure 2A, peak 1) and were not detected in control microsomal reactions (Figure 3D). In this context, DAF-9 substrate specificity required a 3-keto-Δ4 structure, since the 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-sterols, (25R) and (25S),26-hydroxycholesterol were not oxidized (data not shown). Finally, incubation of either sterol (25R),26-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (R-OH) or (25S),26-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (S-OH) with DAF-9 microsomes resulted in complete rescue of Daf-c and Mig phenotypes in 100% of animals tested (Figure 3E). In contrast, extracts from control microsomes incubated with the (25R)-sterol had no effect, while the (25S)-sterol caused an incomplete rescue (10% molt defects, 75% sterile Mig adults) resembling the activity in peak 2 of Figure 2A (Figure 3E). These results demonstrated that DAF-9 converts 4-cholesten-3-one into daf-9 rescuing activities through successive oxidations at C-26, resulting in the production of carboxylic acid metabolites. Like DAF-9, successive oxidation of sterol substrates at C-26 has been demonstrated for the mammalian cytochrome P450, CYP27A1 (Cali and Russell, 1991Cali J.J. Russell D.W. Characterization of human sterol 27-hydroxylase. A mitochondrial cytochrome P-450 that catalyzes multiple oxidation reaction in bile acid biosynthesis.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7774-7778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, in vitro studies have shown that CYP27A1 utilizes 4-cholesten-3-one more efficiently than cholesterol (Norlin et al., 2003Norlin M. von Bahr S. Bjorkhem I. Wikvall K. On the substrate specificity of human CYP27A1: implications for bile acid and cholestanol formation.J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 1515-1522Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the ability of CYP27A1 to metabolize 4-cholesten-3-one into a DAF-12 activator. Cotransfection of HEK293 cells with GAL4-DAF-12, human or mouse CYP27A1, and bovine adrenodoxin resulted in strong activation of GAL4-DAF-12 (Figure S2). In contrast, DAF-12 was not activated by 4-cholesten-3-one in the presence of bovine adrenodoxin alone. Interestingly, cotransfection of CYP27A1 in the presence of 25μM lathosterone (which is a very good DAF-9 substrate) had no effect. Therefore, DAF-9 and CYP27A1 have similar enzymatic activities and overlapping, but distinct, substrate specificities. To confirm C-26 carboxylic acids of 4-cholesten-3-one (i.e., 3-keto-4-cholestenoic acid) as the more potent DAF-9 metabolites, we synthesized their diastereomers (Figure 4A; Table S1) and tested their ability to transactivate DAF-12. The synthetic compounds exhibited chromatographic and mass spectral properties identical to the acidic metabolites obtained from DAF-9 microsomes (Figure S3). When tested in the cotransfection assay, DAF-12 responded to all fo"

Together, CSL and ANK create a groove to bind the MAML-1 polypeptide as a kinked, 70 A helix.

Here we report the 3.1 A structure of the ternary complex formed by CSL, NotchIC, and Mastermind bound to DNA. As expected, the RAM domain of Notch interacts with the beta trefoil domain of CSL; however, the C-terminal domain of CSL has an unanticipated central role in the interface formed with the Notch ankyrin repeats and Mastermind. Ternary complex formation induces a substantial conformational change within CSL, suggesting a molecular mechanism for the conversion of CSL from a repressor to an activator."

This asymmetric signature is consistent with a locally enhanced dust production in the south polar region of Enceladus. Other Cassini experiments revealed evidence for geophysical activities near Enceladus' south pole: a high surface temperature and a release of water gas. Production or release of dust particles related to these processes may provide the dominant source of Saturn's E ring."

In this study, we identify and analyze genes required for germline removal to extend life span. We find that the reproductive system communicates with the intestine through lipophilic-hormone signaling and that a gene called kri-1 is likely to act in the intestine to promote DAF-16 nuclear localization in response to this signal. This lipophilic-signaling pathway and kri-1 are not required for DAF-16's nuclear localization and life-span extension in animals with decreased insulin/IGF-1 signaling. Thus, this pathway specifically enables the integration of cues from the reproductive system with central DAF-16-activation pathways to influence the aging of the animal."
https://openalex.org/W2111012767,"Drosophila Polycomb group (PcG) proteins silence homeotic genes through binding to Polycomb group response elements (PREs). Fab-7 is a PRE-containing regulatory element from the homeotic gene Abdominal-B. When present in multiple copies in the genome, Fab-7 can induce long-distance gene contacts that enhance PcG-dependent silencing. We show here that components of the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery are involved in PcG-mediated silencing at Fab-7 and in the production of small RNAs at transgenic Fab-7 copies. In general, these mutations do not affect the recruitment of PcG components, but they are specifically required for the maintenance of long-range contacts between Fab-7 copies. Dicer-2, PIWI, and Argonaute1, three RNAi components, frequently colocalize with PcG bodies, and their mutation significantly reduces the frequency of PcG-dependent chromosomal associations of endogenous homeotic genes. This suggests a novel role for the RNAi machinery in regulating the nuclear organization of PcG chromatin targets."

Here, we report an unprecedented link between TGF-beta signaling and arterial hypertension based on the analysis of mice mutant for Emilin1, a cysteine-rich secreted glycoprotein expressed in the vascular tree. Emilin1 knockout animals display increased blood pressure, increased peripheral vascular resistance, and reduced vessel size. Mechanistically, we found that Emilin1 inhibits TGF-beta signaling by binding specifically to the proTGF-beta precursor and preventing its maturation by furin convertases in the extracellular space. In support of these findings, genetic inactivation of Emilin1 causes increased TGF-beta signaling in the vascular wall. Strikingly, high blood pressure observed in Emilin1 mutants is rescued to normal levels upon inactivation of a single TGF-beta1 allele. This study highlights the importance of modulation of TGF-beta availability in the pathogenesis of hypertension."

In C. elegans, the sole insulin/IGF-1 receptor, DAF-2, negatively regulates the FOXO transcription factor, DAF-16. We report here on a new component of the IIS longevity pathway, SMK-1, which specifically influences DAF-16-dependent regulation of the aging process in C. elegans by regulating the transcriptional specificity of DAF-16 activity. Localization analysis of DAF-16 places SMK-1 downstream of DAF-16's phosphorylation-dependent relocation to the nucleus. Physiological and transcription analyses indicate that smk-1 is required for the innate immune, UV, and oxidative stress but not the thermal stress functions of DAF-16. SMK-1 therefore plays a role in longevity by modulating DAF-16 transcriptional specificity without affecting other processes regulated by IIS."

https://openalex.org/W2000764014,"Many prokaryotic protein complexes underlie polar asymmetry. In Caulobacter crescentus, a flagellum is built exclusively at the pole that arose from the previous cell division. The basis for this pole specificity is unclear but could involve a cytokinetic birth scar that marks the newborn pole as the flagellum assembly site. We identified two developmental proteins, TipN and TipF, which localize to the division septum and the newborn pole after division. We show that septal localization of TipN/F depends on cytokinesis. Moreover, TipF, a c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase homolog, is a flagellum assembly factor that relies on TipN for proper positioning. In the absence of TipN, flagella are assembled at ectopic locations, and TipF is mislocalized to such sites. Thus TipN and TipF establish a link between bacterial cytokinesis and polar asymmetry, demonstrating that division does indeed leave a positional mark in its wake to direct the biogenesis of a polar organelle."

The Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science instrument inferred little plasma density increase near Enceladus. These data are consistent with ion formation via charge exchange and pickup by Saturn's magnetic field.

Here we identify a landmark protein, TipN, which acts as a spatial and temporal cue for setting up the correct polarity in the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus. TipN marks the new pole throughout most of the cell cycle, and its relocation to the nascent poles at the end of division provides a preexisting reference point for orienting the polarity axis in the progeny. Deletion of tipN causes pleiotropic polarity defects, including frequently reversed asymmetry in progeny size and mislocalization of proteins and organelles. Ectopic localization of TipN along the lateral side of the cell creates new axes of polarity leading to cell branching and formation of competent cell poles. Localization defects of the actin-like protein MreB in the ΔtipN mutant suggest that TipN is upstream of MreB in regulating cell polarity."

Type 1A PI3Ks, p110α, p110β, and p110δ, associate with one of the five regulatory subunits: p50α, p55α, and p85α (products of alternative splicing of a single gene) and p55γ and p85β (2Koyasu S. Nat.

Type 1A PI3Ks are activated by interactions with tyrosine-phosphorylated molecules, whereas p110γ is activated by heterotrimeric G proteins Gα and Gβγ that bind to the pleckstrin homology domain found in the NH2-terminal region of PI3Kγ (3Stephens L.R.

PI3Ks catalyze the conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which is involved in the recruitment and activation of a variety of regulatory proteins via interactions with their pleckstrin homology and phox homology domains (21Ellson C.D.

NADPH oxidase is a tightly regulated membrane-bound enzyme complex catalyzing the one-electron reduction of oxygen to superoxide with the simultaneous oxidation of cytosolic NADPH (25Babior B.M. Lambeth J.D. Nauseef W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). We showed that TNFα-induced oxidant generation in ECs requires activation of PKCζ (26Rahman A. Anwar K.N. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C906-C914Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rahman A. Bando M. Kefer J. Anwar K.N. Malik A.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 575-583PubMed Google Scholar). PKCζ associates with and phosphorylates p47phox, and in turn promotes p47phox association with Nox2 to generate the active NADPH oxidase complex (28Frey R.S. Rahman A. Kefer J.C. Minshall R.D. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 29Dang P.M. Fontayne A. Hakim J. El Benna J. Perianin A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1206-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). We also showed that PKCζ activation of NADPH oxidase was required for TNFα-induced oxidant generation in ECs (28Frey R.S. Rahman A. Kefer J.C. Minshall R.D. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In the present study, we addressed a possible role for PI3Kγ as an upstream regulator of PKCζ activation and thereby in mediating NADPH oxidase assembly and generating the oxidant signaling required for NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression in ECs. Our results show that TNFα induces PIP3 production and mediates the PI3Kγ activation of PKCζ. We show that PI3Kγ plays a crucial role in signaling the activation of NADPH oxidase required for NF-κB activation and ICAM-1 expression in ECs.

Cell Culture—HPAECs were cultured in EBM2 (endothelial basal medium) complete medium in gelatin-coated flasks with bullet kit additives. Mouse lung vascular endothelial cells (MLVECs) from WT (C57BL/6) and p110γ–/– mice were cultured as described (28Frey R.S. Rahman A. Kefer J.C. Minshall R.D. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 30Fan J. Frey R.S. Malik A.B. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1234-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). C57BL/6 WT mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories and p110γ knockout mice were provided by J. Penninger (Amgen Institute, Toronto, Canada). MLVECs were characterized by their cobblestone morphology, Factor VIII and VE-cadherin staining, and uptake of low density lipoprotein. RAW 264.7 cells are a macrophage-like, Abelson leukemia virus transformed cell line derived from BALB/c mice. The cells are grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 mm HEPES, and 2 mm l-glutamine at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Prior to assay, the medium is changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 2 h. After the addition of zymosan A (125 μg/ml), the cells are placed on ice, and the medium is aspirated at the appropriate time point. The cells are washed with 1.5 ml of ice-cold PBS solution, pelleted, and PBS-aspirated. PKCζ Kinase Assay—PKCζ activity was assayed as described (32Javaid K. Rahman A. Anwar K.N. Frey R.S. Minshall R.D. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against PKC using protein A/G conjugated to agarose. The immunocomplexes were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and once with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 2.5 μg of histone H1, 0.5 mm cold ATP, and 20–30 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixture was incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and the reaction terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer. The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the phosphorylated form of histone H1 was detected by autoradiography. Phosphatidylinositol Extraction—The procedures were conducted as described (31Milne S.B. Ivanova P.T. Decamp D. Hsueh R.C. Brown H.A. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1796-1802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, ice-cold 1:1 CHCl3:CH3OH is added to each cell pellet and vortexed for 1 min, samples are centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C, and supernatant is discarded. The remaining cell pellet is suspended in 200 μl of 2:1CHCl3:CH3OH containing 0.25% 12 n HCl, vortexed for 5 min, and pulse-spun. To the supernatant 40 μl of 1 n HCl are added, vortexed for 15 s, and centrifuged to separate the phases. The solvent from the collected lower layer is evaporated in a vacuum centrifuge, and lipid film was rapidly redissolved in 55 μl of 1:1:0.3 CHCl3: CH3OH:H2O. Before analysis, 5 μl of 300 mm piperidine are added, and the sample is vortexed and pulse-spun. MS Analysis of PIP3—Mass spectral analysis was performed on a Finnigan TSQ Quantum triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo-Finnigan, San Jose, CA) as described (31Milne S.B. Ivanova P.T. Decamp D. Hsueh R.C. Brown H.A. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1796-1802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The samples were analyzed at an infusion rate of 10 μl/min in negative ionization mode over the range of m/z 400–1200. Peaks corresponding to known PIP3s were fragmented and manually inspected for the presence of the identification peaks. A confirmed identification was achieved when key fragmentation peaks were larger than three times the signal to-noise ratio. The lower limit of detection using this method was reported to be less than 9 pmol/ml for 38:4 PIP3 (Avanti Polar Lipids). Immunoblotting—ECs were washed with ice-cold Tris-buffered saline and lysed in 10 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. The lysates were sonicated for 10 s and then ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected and designated as cytosolic fraction. To isolate the membrane fraction, the remaining pellet was resuspended in the above lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, sonicated, and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C (28Frey R.S. Rahman A.

Immunocomplexes were Western blotted as described (32Javaid K. Rahman A. Anwar K.N. Frey R.S. Minshall R.D. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 1089-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For analysis of Ser-p47phox phosphorylation, total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with p47phox antibody and Western blotted with phospho-Ser antibody. For analysis of total p47phox phosphorylation, total cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with p47phox antibody and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and gels were stained with Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein gel stain (33Martin K. Steinberg T.H. Cooley L.A. Gee K.R. Beechem J.M. Patton W.F. Proteomics. 2003; 3: 1244-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy—HPAECs, grown on gelatin-coated coverslips, were treated as indicated, washed with HBSS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and blocked with 5% goat serum containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.01% NaN3, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Thereafter, the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 1 μg of the indicated primary antibody. After three washes in HBSS, 4 μg/ml secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 and 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were added for an additional 2 h at room temperature. The cells were extensively washed in HBSS and mounted on glass slides with ProLong Antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes), and the images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope. For p110γ-PKCζ co-localization studies, the cells were incubated with TNFα, fixed, and co-incubated with a rat monoclonal antibody to PKCζ, a rabbit polyclonal antibody to p110γ and secondary antibodies Alexa Fluor 488 and 594 IgG as described above. For PIP3 detection, WT MLVECs were incubated with TNFα, fixed, and incubated with monoclonal antibody to PIP3 (34Chen R. Kang V.H. Chen J. Shope J.C. Torabinejad J. DeWald D.B. Prestwich G.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2002; 50: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and secondary Alexa Flour 594 IgM. Appropriate band filters were used to detect both proteins and PIP3. Fixed cells labeled with p110γ-PKCζ antibodies were optically sectioned into z-stacks (0.3-μm-thick confocal sections) with the pinhole set to 1 Airy unit. Quantification of co-localization between p110γ and PKCζ was performed using the co-localization module of Zeiss LSM 510–3.2 software. Alterations in Cell Surface ICAM-1—MLVECs from WT and p110γ–/– mice were grown on gelatin-coated coverslips, incubated with TNFα, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.4% Triton X-100/PBS, blocked with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% gelatin, and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with ICAM-1 antibody, or for 1 h with anti-ICAM IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate and goat polyclonal VE-cadherin antibodies. The cells were washed three times with PBS, incubated with Alexa Fluor 594 IgG, and mounted on glass slides with ProLong Antifade mounting medium (Molecular Probes). The images were acquired with a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope. Quantification of ICAM-1 staining intensity in VE-cadherin-stained plasma membranes was from three to four images/coverslip, with each image containing an average of eight cells using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). RT-PCR—All of the methods were performed by ACGT Inc. (Wheeling, IL). Total RNA was isolated and reversed-transcribed using the Invitrogen Super-Script RT-PCR kit. All of the following human gene specific primers for p110γ amplification were used for PCR (35Krymskaya V.P. Ammit A.J. Hoffman R.K. Eszterhas A.J. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Am. J.

Mouse specific primers designed to span exons 3 to 6 of the p110γ gene were as follows: forward, 5′-AGAGAAGTATGACGTCAGTTCC-3′; reverse 5′-TTGAGCCATCGTTGTGGCATCC-3′. The cDNA obtained from RT-PCR was PCR-amplified using Invitrogen Platinum Taq, and the entire PCR product was sequenced in double strand and compared with the expected reference sequence. The human sequence is deposited in Gen-Bank™ (accession number AY496423), and the mouse sequence is deposited in GenBank™ (accession number AY831679). Oxidant Generation—Oxidant generation in MLVECs was measured as described (28Frey R.S. Rahman A. Kefer J.C. Minshall R.D. Malik A.B. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1012-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The cells were loaded with the fluorescent dye carboxy-H2DCFDA (10 μm; Molecular Probes) for 1 h. After treatment with TNFα, the cells were washed twice with HBSS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. The cultures were then viewed with fluorescence microscopy. Electrophoretic Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear protein extracts were prepared as described with the addition of protease inhibitors (37Fan J. Frey R.S. Rahman A. Malik A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3404-3411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The extracted protein was quantified, aliquoted (40–50 μg/aliquot), and stored at –70 °C until use. The oligonucleotide was radiolabeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear protein (10–15 μg) was incubated for 15 min at room temperature with labeled oligonucleotide. Incubation mixtures were separated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The following oligonucleotides were used for gel shift analysis: ICAM-1 NF-κB: 5′-AGCTTGGAAATTCCGGAGCTG-3′ and Ig-κB: 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′. The oligonucleotide designated as ICAM-1 NF-κB represents the 21-bp sequence of ICAM-1 promoter encompassing NF-κB binding site located 223 bp upstream of translation initiation site. The Ig-κB oligonucleotide contains the consensus NF-κB binding site present in the immunoglobulin gene. Sequence motifs within the oligonucleotides are underlined. PMN Adhesion Assay—PMN adhesion to endothelial cells was determined with the modifications as described below (38Lo S.K. Janakidevi K. Lai L. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L406-L412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated MLVECs from WT and p110γ–/– mice were grown to confluence in 96-well gelatin-coated plates. Mouse PMNs were isolated from whole blood as described (38Lo S.K. Janakidevi K. Lai L. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: L406-L412Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); PMN purity was >95%, and the viability assessed by trypan blue exclusion was >98%. PMNs labeled with calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) were added to MLVECs pretreated with TNFα (40 ng/ml) for the times indicated at 37 °C. Naïve PMNs were incubated with MLVECs for 2 h and washed six times with EBM2 medium, and the fluorescence readings were obtained using the PTI spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International, Monmouth Junction, NJ) with detection at 494 and 517 nm, respectively. Data Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using two-way analysis of variance. The numbers of experiments in the different groups are given in the figure legends. A value of p < 0.05 was used as the criterion for significance. The ECL signal was quantitated with Scion Image 4.02 software (Scion Image Corp., Frederick, MD). Carboxy-H2DCFDA fluorescence was quantified using Image Pro-Plus 1.3 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD), and ICAM-1 cell surface expression was quantified using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The data for MS were collected with the Xcalibur software package (Thermo, San Jose, CA). PI3Kγ Expression in Endothelial Cells—We initially determined the expression profile of p110γ mRNA and protein in primary human and mouse ECs. RT-PCR was carried out using a set of primers specific for human and mouse p110γ mRNA on total RNA from HPAECs, human monocytic cell line THP-1, and MLVECs (35Krymskaya V.P. Ammit A.J. Hoffman R.K.

https://openalex.org/W1978950863,"A biosynthetic approach was developed to control and probe cooperativity in multiunit biomotor assemblies by linking molecular motors to artificial protein scaffolds. This approach provides precise control over spatial and elastic coupling between motors. Cooperative interactions between monomeric kinesin-1 motors attached to protein scaffolds enhance hydrolysis activity and microtubule gliding velocity. However, these interactions are not influenced by changes in the elastic properties of the scaffold, distinguishing multimotor transport from that powered by unorganized monomeric motors. These results highlight the role of supramolecular architecture in determining mechanisms of collective transport."

Here we show that Laonastes is actually a surviving member of the otherwise extinct rodent family Diatomyidae, known from early Oligocene to late Miocene sites in Pakistan, India, Thailand, China, and Japan. Laonastes is a particularly striking example of the “Lazarus effect” in Recent mammals, whereby a taxon that was formerly thought to be extinct is rediscovered in the extant biota, in this case after a temporal gap of roughly 11 million years."
https://openalex.org/W2034804198,"Zebrafish is a powerful vertebrate model system for using forward genetics to elucidate mechanisms of early development. We have used chemical mutagenesis to screen for mutants that show defects in the CNS. Here we describe the isolation of the bap28 mutation that leads to abnormalities in the brain starting at midsomitogenesis stages. Mutant embryos display excess apoptosis primarily in the central nervous system (CNS) and die by days 6-7 after fertilization. The mutation was positionally cloned and shown to affect a gene that encodes a large protein with high similarity to the uncharacterized human protein BAP28 and lower similarity to yeast Utp10. Utp10 is a component of a nucleolar U3 small nucleolar RNA-containing RNP complex that is required for transcription of ribosomal DNA and for processing of 18 S rRNA. We show that zebrafish Bap28 likewise is required for rRNA transcription and processing, with a major effect on 18 S rRNA maturation. We suggest that bap28 is required for cell survival in the CNS through its role in rRNA synthesis and processing. Inhibition of p53 protein expression in bap28 mutants led to embryos with morphologically normal appearance, suggesting that p53 is involved in triggering apoptosis in the bap28 mutant CNS.

The bap28 mutation provides a genetic approach to study the role of ribosome biogenesis in the development of a vertebrate embryo. Cell growth and proliferation in vertebrates must be synchronized with differentiation because cells usually withdraw from the cell cycle before terminal differentiation. Deregulation of these processes can lead to hypertrophy, apoptosis, or cancer. Such coordinate control requires the production of proteins in proportion to the rate of proliferation and increases in cell size. Thus, ribosome biogenesis is a tightly regulated process that involves many events including rRNA transcription, processing, modification, and folding, the coordinated synthesis of ribosomal proteins, and the assembly and export of the ribosomal particles. This process has been studied most extensively in yeast because of the powerful genetic and biochemical tools available in this organism. The steps for rRNA synthesis and maturation are complicated processes that are regulated by protein complexes at different levels. RNA polymerase I and cofactors transcribe the multicopy rRNA genes to produce a large rRNA precursor that contains the 18 S, 5.8 S, and 28 S rRNA sequences as well as spacer regions. External transcribed spacers (ETS) 3The abbreviations used are: ETS, external transcribed spacers; ITS, internal transcribed spacers; TMP, 4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; sno, small nucleolar; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; TUNEL, terminal dUTP nick-end labeling; MO, morpholino; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism; CNS, central nervous system; hpf, hours post-fertilization; dpf, days post-fertilization; contig, group of overlapping clones. 3The abbreviations used are: ETS, external transcribed spacers; ITS, internal transcribed spacers; TMP, 4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen; RNP, ribonucleoprotein; sno, small nucleolar; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; TUNEL, terminal dUTP nick-end labeling; MO, morpholino; RFLP, restriction fragment length polymorphism; CNS, central nervous system; hpf, hours post-fertilization; dpf, days post-fertilization; contig, group of overlapping clones. are located at both the 5′ and 3′ ends of the pre-rRNAs, and two internal transcribed spacers (ITS) lie between the 18, 5.8, and 28 S sequences. The pre-rRNA undergoes multiple modifications and cleavages to generate the mature forms. This overall pattern of rRNA synthesis and processing is well conserved among eukaryotes, but the specific order of processing steps and the length of spacers and to a lesser extent of mature rRNAs varies considerably. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cleavage in the ETS followed by cleavages in the ITS1 generate precursors to the mature 18 S and 25 S rRNAs (1Granneman S. Baserga S.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 296: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In Xenopus laevis, rRNA processing follows two alternate pathways, one leading from a large precursor directly to 18 S rRNA, and the other including an 18 S rRNA-specific intermediate named 20 S RNA (2Savino R. Gerbi S.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2299-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). rRNA maturation requires several RNP complexes containing small nucleolar (sno) RNAs and many proteins (3Filipowicz W. Pogacic V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 4Kiss T. Cell. 2002; 109: 145-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). U3 snoRNA complexes are prominently involved in the production of 18 S rRNA and assembly of the small ribosomal subunit (2Savino R. Gerbi S.A.

In S. cerevisiae a 90 S complex has been identified many years ago as a precursor to 40 S and 60 S subunits (6Udem S.A. Warner J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 65: 227-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 7Trapman J. Planta R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 442: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Trapman J. Planta R.J. Raue H.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 442: 275-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Pre-ribosomes are assembled and processed in the nucleolus, transferred to the nucleoplasm as pre-60 S and pre-40 S intermediates, and exported to the cytoplasm to form mature 60 S and 40 S ribosome subunits. Recently, several pre-ribosomal complexes have been isolated, and their protein composition has been elucidated (9Grandi P. Rybin V. Bassler J. Petfalski E. Strauss D. Marzioch M. Schafer T. Kuster B. Tschochner H. Tollervey D. Gavin A.C. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 105-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Nascent pre-rRNA appears to assemble co-transcriptionally with a protein complex, as indicated by the “terminal knobs” seen at the 5′ end of pre-rRNAs in Miller spreads (10Miller O.L. Jr-Beatty B.R. Science. 1969; 164: 955-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). These knobs may correspond to RNP particles named the small ribosomal subunit (SSU) processome or 90 S pre-ribosome; these particles appear to be precursors to the 40 S ribosomal subunit as they contain U3 snoRNA and known small subunit processing factors but few components involved in large subunit processing (9Grandi P. Rybin V. Bassler J. Petfalski E. Strauss D. Marzioch M. Schafer T. Kuster B. Tschochner H. Tollervey D. Gavin A.C. Hurt E. Mol.

A component of the SSU processome named Utp10, a protein that is essential for survival in yeast, is located in the nucleolus and contains the Huntington-elongation-A subunit-TOR (HEAT) repeat designated as a protein interaction domain (12Oeffinger M. Dlakic M. Tollervey D. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Utp10 also is a component of a distinct U3 snoRNA-containing complex that associates with the 5′-ETS of pre-rRNA (13Krogan N.J. Peng W.T. Cagney G. Robinson M.D. Haw R. Zhong G. Guo X. Zhang X. Canadien V. Richards D.P. Beattie B.K. Lalev A. Zhang W. Davierwala A.P. Mnaimneh S. Starostine A. Tikuisis A.P. Grigull J. Datta N. Bray J.E. Hughes T.R. Emili A. Greenblatt J.F. Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 225-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Thus, Utp10 is implicated in processing events that lead to mature 18 S rRNA and the 40 S ribosomal subunit in yeast. The tumor suppressor gene product p53 protects cells from transformation and tumorigenesis by responding to various stresses to activate genes that induce apoptosis, cell growth arrest, and senescence (14Sharpless N.E. DePinho R.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 15Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5798) Google Scholar). Normally, p53 protein is maintained at a low level by a negative feedback mechanism. Mdm2, a ring finger containing E3 ubiquitin ligase, plays a major role in this negative regulation by ubiquitinating p53 to trigger its degradation by the proteasome (15Vogelstein B. Lane D. Levine A.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (5798) Google Scholar). Ribosomal biogenesis stress leads to effects on the cell cycle in a p53-dependent manner (16Pestov D.G. Strezoska Z. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4246-4255Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), and perturbation of rRNA synthesis by actinomycin D or by injection of anti-upstream binding factor antibody stabilizes p53 protein (17Andera L. Wasylyk B. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 852-863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Rubbi C.P. Milner J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6068-6077Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). In addition, ribosomal proteins L5, L11, and L23 form a complex with MDM2, and thus, free ribosomal proteins may activate p53 by preventing its proteasomal degradation (19Dai M.S. Zeng S.X. Jin Y. Sun X.X. David L. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 7654-7668Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of p53 is one mechanism through which impairment of ribosome biogenesis may affect cell behavior. We report here the isolation and characterization of a mutant in zebrafish that affects development of the early nervous system. Increased apoptosis leads to diminished populations of neural cells with a notable deficit in neuronal precursors, whereas the overall patterning of the nervous system is not changed. We have identified the locus disabled in this mutation as encoding Bap28, a vertebrate homolog of Utp10 whose function has not been studied previously. In mutant zebrafish embryos, processing of rRNA and especially of 18 S rRNA is reduced, providing a molecular basis for the phenotype that we observed. Knockdown of p53 through an antisense morpholino in bap28 mutant embryos led to a significant reduction of apoptotic cell death, indicating that impairment of bap28 activates p53. The bap28 mutant allows the study of developmental consequences of compromised ribosome biogenesis in a vertebrate embryo. Zebrafish Maintenance—The Oregon AB* line was used for mutagenesis. Heterozygous mutants were crossed to the WIK line for mapping (20Nechiporuk A. Finney J.E. Keating M.T. Johnson S.L. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 1231-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Embryos were kept at 28.5 °C and staged according to Kimmel et al. (21Kimmel C.B. Ballard W.W. Kimmel S.R. Ullmann B. Schilling T.F. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 203: 253-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8709) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis—Wild type sperm was collected by gently squeezing the abdomen of male fish 8-14 months old. Approximately 5 μl of sperm in 350 μl of isotonic buffer (116 mm NaCl, 23 mm KCl, 6 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgSO4, 29 mm NaHCO3, 0.5% fructose) was mixed with 4,5′,8-trimethylpsoralen (TMP) at 50 pg/ml on ice and irradiated with 366-nm UV light (Ultraviolet Products, Inc. model UVSL-58) held 3.5 cm above the sample for 6 min. TMP-treated sperm were used to fertilize wild type eggs (22Walker C. Methods Cell Biol. 1999; 60: 43-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization—Embryos were analyzed by whole-mount in situ hybridization by the protocol of Strahle et al. (23Strahle U. Blader P. Ingham P.W. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 40: 929-940PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modification; 1) 0.3% CHAPS was added to all wash solutions, and 2) after hybridization, samples were washed twice with 0.2 × SSC (1 × SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.3% CHAPS at 65 °C for 0.5 h. The bap28 probe contained the 3.3-kilobase region from the 3′ end of the cDNA. TUNEL Assay—For detection of apoptotic cells, the TUNEL assay was performed as described by Kawahara and Dawid (24Kawahara A. Dawid I.B. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1353-1357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Morpholino Oligonucleotide Injection—Control, BAP28, and p53 morpholinos were obtained from Gene Tools, LLC. Sequences are: control morpholino (MO), 5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA-3′; BAP28-MO, 5′-GATGCGCTAACGATGTCATCTTTGG-3′. The sequence complementary to the initiation codon is underlined. The sequence of p53 morpholino was described by Langheinrich et al. (25Langheinrich U. Hennen E. Stott G. Vacun G. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 2023-2028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). 0.5 or 3 ng of morpholinos against BAP28 or p53 were injected into the yolk region of one-to-two-cell embryos. Northern Blotting—Total cellular RNA was prepared from 18 somite stage embryos using RNA wizard (Ambion). Total RNA (1.5 μg per lane) was separated by electrophoresis on a 6% formaldehyde, 1.2% agarose gel and blotted onto a nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham Biosciences). RNA blots were fixed to the membrane by UV irradiation and probed with 32P-labeled zebrafish 5′-ETS, ITS1, and ITS2 sequences, amplified from genomic DNA by PCR using the following primers: 5′-ETS (5′-CCGGTCTACCTCGAAAGTC-3′ and 5′-CGAGCAGAGTGGTAGAGGAAG-3′); ITS1 (5′-CTCGGAAAACGGTGAACCTG-3′ and 5′-GTGTTCGTTTCAGGGTCCG-3′); ITS2 (5′-CCTAAGCGCAGACCGTCAC-3′ and 5′-AGCGCTGGCCTCGGAGATC-3′); and 18 S (5′-CCGCTAGAGGTGAAATTCTTG-3′ and 5′-CAGCTTTGCAACCATACTCC-3′). Incubation was in hybridization buffer (Rapid hyb bf, Amersham Biosciences) at 65 °C for 12 h followed by washing twice with 2 × saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA (SSPE), 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min and once in 1 × SSPE, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 30 min, and bands were visualized by autoradiography. Meiotic and Physical Mapping—Simple sequence length polymorphism mapping was described previously (26Knapik E.W. Goodman A. Ekker M. Chevrette M. Delgado J. Neuhauss S. Shimoda N. Driever W. Fishman M.C. Jacob H.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones were identified from filters (CHORI-211) by hybridization using oligonucleotide probes. We followed the description of Roman et al. (27Roman B.L. Pham V.N. Lawson N.D. Kulik M. Childs S. Lekven A.C. Garrity D.M. Moon R.T. Fishman M.C. Lechleider R.J. Weinstein B.M. Development. 2002; 129: 3009-3019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to find polymorphisms and design restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers (27Roman B.L. Pham V.N. Lawson N.D. Kulik M.

To recognize the mutation site, the genomic DNAs extracted from normal and mutant embryos were amplified. The sequences for the primers are 5′-GGACTGGAGGAGCTGATG-3′ and 5′-TTCAATGCATTTCAGAGCAGGC-3′. The 194-bp PCR products were digested by GsuI (Fermentas). Expected sizes of cleaved bands from homozygous wild type are 25 and 179 bp, whereas homozygous mutants yield bands of 25, 114, and 55 bp. With the aim of obtaining mutations that affect the development of the CNS, we evaluated the potential of the DNA cross-linking reagent TMP as a mutagen in zebrafish. TMP has been used as a mutagen in Escherichia coli and is known to induce small deletions in Caenorhabditis elegans (28Kirkland D.J. Creed K.L. Mannisto P. Mutat. Res. 1983; 116: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Yandell M.D. Edgar L.G. Wood W.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In zebrafish, no tectal neuron (ntn) is a TMP-induced mutant that has been shown to carry a 143-bp deletion (30Lekven A.C. Helde K.A. Thorpe C.J. Rooke R. Moon R.T. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 2: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 31Ando H. Mishina M. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 244: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 32Matsuda N. Mishina M. Development. 2004; 131: 1913-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Among a small number of mutants obtained we chose a line that showed defects in brain development for further analysis. For reasons that will be explained below we named the affected locus bap28. bap28 Mutants Exhibit Abnormalities in the Midbrain-Hindbrain Boundary and the Forebrain—Zebrafish embryos homozygous for the bap28 allele, which is recessive, showed an abnormal structure and dark, rough tissue in the midbrain-hindbrain boundary by 12-18 somite stages, whereas the trunk region including the somites and notochord appeared to be normal (Fig. 1, A and B). From this stage onward, the bap28 mutant embryos showed delayed development. At 25 hpf, enlargement of tectal and hindbrain ventricles was observed in the mutant, whereas the trunk and tail still appeared normal (Fig. 1, C-F), and by 2 days post-fertilization (dpf), the head and eye were smaller in bap28 embryos as compared with the wild type. The heart and brain region in mutant embryos displayed severe edema by 4 dpf, and blood flow was slow and often accompanied by shunts in major vessels. The mutant embryos died between 6 and 7 dpf. Neuronal Progenitor Cells Are Reduced in the bap28 Mutant—To reveal the cell types affected in the bap28 mutant, we performed in situ hybridization with marker genes characteristic for various cell types in the CNS. The expression of the neuronal progenitor markers zash1a and neurogenin1 (ngn1) (33Allende M.L. Weinberg E.S. Dev. Biol. 1994; 166: 509-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 34Korzh V. Sleptsova I. Liao J. He J. Gong Z. Dev. Dyn. 1998; 213: 92-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) was reduced in the mutant. Zash1a was significantly reduced in the retina of bap28 mutant embryos by the 18 somite stage (Fig. 2, A and B), and this reduction became more apparent in the entire brain at 25 hpf (Fig. 2, C and D). Likewise, ngn1 expression was reduced in the midbrain and hindbrain at the 18 somite stage, and the deficit became more prominent at 25 hpf (Fig. 2, E-H). Although the expression level of these genes was strongly reduced, their pattern of expression seemed unaffected, suggesting that cell fate is not changed in the mutant. The expression of other markers including shh and krox20 was not affected in the mutant embryos except for a general delay in development noted above (Fig. 2, I-L). Thus, it appears that the mutant embryos have normal anterior-posterior and dorsal-ventral patterning in the brain. Increased Apoptosis in the CNS of bap28 Mutants—Our results imply that neuronal progenitor cells are initially formed in bap28 mutants but fail to give rise to a normal number of cells in subsequent development. Thus, these neuronal progenitor cells might be blocked in their development, leading to apoptosis. We tested this notion by checking for apoptotic cell death by TUNEL assay at different developmental stages. Similar levels and patterns of TUNEL-positive cells were detected in wild type embryos as reported by Cole and Ross (35Cole L.K. Ross L.S. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 123-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), but DNA fragmentation in the bap28 mutant appeared to increase at the 10 somite stage. At the 18 somite stage, when morphological defects become apparent, cell death increased dramatically within the mutant brain and spinal cord (Fig. 3, A and B). Cell death in the spinal cord was unexpected because the morphology of trunk and tail appears to be normal. Sections of the trunk region of bap28 mutant embryos showed that dying cells are localized within the spinal cord, and no bias was observed with respect to localization of degenerating cells at specific dorsoventral levels (data not shown). Slightly elevated levels of cell death were also observed in the tail bud. Thus, mutation in the bap28 gene results in increased apoptosis primarily in the CNS, which can account for the compromised development of the brain in the mutant embryos. This bap28 mutant phenotype appeared to be similar to the mutant named gumowy described in a large scale ethylnitrosourea screen (36Abdelilah S. Mountcastle-Shah E. Harvey M. Solnica-Krezel L. Schier A.F. Stemple D.L. Malicki J. Neuhauss S.C. Zwartkruis F. Stainier D.Y. Rangini Z. Driever W. Development. 1996; 123: 217-227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but we have not tested complementation between these two lines. Molecular Nature of the bap28 Mutant—To identify the gene responsible for the mutation, we mapped bap28 by bulk segregant analysis with simple sequence length polymorphism markers (37Postlethwait J.H. Talbot W.S. Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 183-190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) to chromosome 12 (data not shown). Linkage was confirmed by genotyping of individual mutant embryos with the flanking simple sequence length polymorphism markers Z23536, Z1473, and Z10806. Fine mapping allowed us to restrict the critical interval harboring the mutation between markers Z23536 and Z10806 (Fig. 4A). To establish a physical contig starting from Z23536, BAC clones were isolated using Z23536 sequences as probe (see “Experimental Procedures”). We obtained BAC clones zC90G3 and zC100M12 that overlap with Z23536. These BAC clones overlap with ctg11003 from the Sanger Center zebrafish genome data base (Assembly version 2), and contig sequences were used to identify BAC clones zC146F4, zC277H15, and zC68H15 in the fpc website of the Sanger Institute (Fig. 4A, red). Three RFLP markers, named A, B, and C, were designed from the sequences in the latter BAC clones. All three RFLP markers showed strong linkage to the mutant: A (2 recombinations in 904 meiosis), B (0/1526), and C (1/1104), with the critical interval falling between A and C (Fig. 4A). The RFLP marker B that showed no recombination with the mutation is located within a gene with high sequence similarity to a named but uncharacterized human gene, BAP28 (direct submission GenBank™ XM375853); similarity between the zebrafish and human proteins is distributed along the entire length of the protein (zebrafish bap28 gene, GenBank™ NM199900) (Fig. 5A; supplemental Fig. S1). To test whether this gene is affected in the zebrafish mutant, the cognate cDNA was isolated and sequenced from wild type and mutant embryos (Fig. 4, B-D). bap28 cDNA from mutant embryos contained a 5-bp deletion at amino acid 92 that results in a frameshift adding 22 unrelated residues before a stop codon is encountered (Fig. 4C). The mutant is expected to produce an N-terminal peptide corresponding to less than 5% of the entire Bap28 sequence and, therefore, almost certainly represents a null mutation. A search for a possible domain structure using two independent motif search databases revealed the presence of HEAT repeats, considered to be protein-protein interaction modules. The 5-bp deletion in the mutant introduces a stop codon before the first of these HEAT repeats (Fig. 4D). To further test the conclusion that impairment of the bap28 gene is sufficient to cause the mutant morphology, an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide overlapping the start codon of bap28 RNA was injected into wild type embryos. Injection of 0.5 ng of the morpholino was sufficient to phenocopy the mutant (Fig. 4E), indicating that lack of Bap28 protein production is the cause of the phenotype. We, therefore, named the mutant bap28. Because the function of the mammalian Bap28 protein has not been characterized, we searched for similar proteins in other species. These searches indicated low but substantial sequence similarity along much of their entire length between Bap28 and the Utp10 proteins of S. cerevisiae (GenBank™; NC001142) and Schizosaccharomyces pombe (GenBank™; CAA18872) (supplemental Fig. S1). We believe that the Utp10 proteins are the orthologs of zebrafish and more generally vertebrate Bap28 because no more similar gene exists in either yeast genome, both of which are fully sequenced. It is notable that S. cerevisiae Utp10 is about as similar to zebrafish Bap28 as it is to S. pombe Utp10; in contrast, the zebrafish and human Bap28 proteins are much more closely related (Fig. 5, A and B; supplemental Fig. S1). The spatial expression of zebrafish bap28 was analyzed by wholemount in situ hybridization (Fig. 6). Bap28 mRNA was expressed maternally and distributed globally until the bud stage (Fig. 6, A-C). Subsequently, high levels of expression were concentrated in the forebrain primordium, eye, midbrain, and midbrain-hindbrain boundary (Fig. 6, D-H). This distribution is consistent with the domains that showed phenotypic abnormalities during somitogenesis stages in the bap28 mutant. rRNA Synthesis and Maturation Are Impaired in the bap28 Mutant—S. cerevisiae Utp10 has been identified as a component of a U3 snoRNA-containing nucleolar complex involved in rRNA maturation that was named the SSU processome (11Dragon F. Gallagher J.E. Compagnone-Post P.A. Mitchell B.M. Porwancher K.A. Wehner K.A. Wormsley S. Settlage R.E. Shabanowitz J. Osheim Y. Beyer A.L. Hunt D.F. Baserga S.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 967-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Utp10 is essential for growth in yeast; its elimination leads to cessation of the production of 18 S rRNA, whereas 28 S rRNA is reduced but not eliminated. Based on the sequence similarity of Bap28 and Utp10, we hypothesized that Bap28 may regulate rRNA maturation in zebrafish. Among eukaryotes, ribosomal gene structure is highly conserved, but details of the processing pathways are more variable. To generate an overview of zebrafish rRNA processing, we generated probes from the external and both internal transcribed spacers (ETS and ITS) based on the available genomic sequence (Fig. 7B). Although sequence similarity allows prediction of mature rRNA regions and, thus, ITS domains in zebrafish, the extent of ETS regions is not known. Northern blots of RNA isolated from 18 somite-stage zebrafish embryos were hybridized with the three transcribed spacer probes, as shown in the wild type (w) lanes of Fig. 7A. We interpret the results as follows (Fig. 7B). A large precursor (a) that contains 5′-ETS and may contain 3′-ETS sequences (the latter was not tested) is processed rapidly to a large intermediate that still retains 5′-ETS and both portions of the ITS (b). Cleavage in ITS1 then separates the 18 S (d) from the 28 S precursor (c); we did not test which of the intermediates retains the 5.8 S RNA but drew it with the 28 S precursor following other systems. We stress that this is only an outline of rRNA processing in zebrafish, especially as it is possible that pathways branch as reported for example in Xenopus (2Savino R. Gerbi S.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2299-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To assess the possible function of Bap28 in rRNA maturation, we compared the processing patterns between sibling phenotypically wild type (homozygous wild type plus heterozygous) and homozygous bap28 mutant embryos at the 18 somite stage. It is important to note that this is the earliest stage at which the mutants can be securely identified and before widespread cell death occurs in the CNS of the affected embryos. Mutant embryos showed strongly reduced rRNA precursors and intermediates (Fig. 7A, compare mutant (m) with wild type (w) lanes). This overall reduction of rRNA production without the accumulation of intermediates implies that Bap28, like its homolog Utp10, might directly regulate rDNA transcription in addition to being an essential component for rRNA processing (38Gallagher J.E. Dunbar D.A. Granneman S. Mitchell B.M. Osheim Y. Beyer A.L. Baserga S.J. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2506-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However the extent of reduction was different for 18 S and 28 S rRNA precursors. Intermediates leading to 18 S rRNA such as RNAs (d) and (e) were almost entirely absent in the mutants, whereas 28 S rRNA intermediates such as RNA (c) were reduced but still present. This result is consistent with the effect of the elimination of Utp10 in yeast where 18 S rRNA is more strongly r"

The N2 position of G, located in minor groove side of duplex DNA, is a major site for DNA modification by various carcinogens. Oligonucleotides with varying adduct size at G N2 were analyzed for bypass ability and fidelity with human pol ι. Pol ι effectively bypassed N2-methyl (Me)G and N2-ethyl(Et)G, partially bypassed N2-isobutyl(Ib)G and N2-benzylG, and was blocked at N2-CH2(2-naphthyl)G (N2-NaphG), N2-CH2(9-anthracenyl)G (N2-AnthG), and N2-CH2(6-benzo[a]pyrenyl)G. Steady-state kinetic analysis showed decreases of kcat/Km for dCTP insertion opposite N2-G adducts according to size, with a maximal decrease opposite N2-AnthG (61-fold). dTTP misinsertion frequency opposite template G was increased 3–11-fold opposite adducts (highest with N2-NaphG), indicating the additive effect of bulk (or possibly hydrophobicity) on T misincorporation. N2-IbG, N2-NaphG, and N2-AnthG also decreased the pre-steady-state kinetic burst rate compared with unmodified G. High kinetic thio effects (Sp-2′-deoxycytidine 5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate)) opposite N2-EtG and N2-AnthG (but not G) suggest that the chemistry step is largely interfered with by adducts. Severe inhibition of polymerization opposite N2,N2-diMeG compared with N2-EtG by pol η but not by pol ι is consistent with Hoogsteen base pairing by pol ι. Thus, polymerization by pol ι is severely inhibited by a bulky group at G N2 despite an advantageous mode of Hoogsteen base pairing; pol ι may play a limited role in translesion synthesis on bulky N2-G adducts in cells.

The accurate and efficient replication of DNA is crucial for preservation of genomic integrity and survival of organisms (1Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication.2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1992Google Scholar). The major obstacle for DNA replication is various DNA lesions that are inevitably formed by both endogenous sources and exogenous mutagens in cells, some of which escape repair and are usually present in replicating DNA (2Searle C.E. Chemical Carcinogens.Vols. 1 and 2. American Chemical Society, Washington, D. C.1984Google Scholar). When encountering lesions during DNA replication, DNA polymerases often show abnormal behavior, misinsertion of incorrect nucleotides, slippage, and blockage of replication, which cause mutation or cell death, leading in turn to detrimental effects, including aging and cancer (3Friedberg E. Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis.2nd Ed. American Society for Microbiololgy, Washington, D. C.2006Google Scholar). Replicative DNA polymerases, which have high fidelity and efficiency with unmodified DNA bases, are intolerant of the geometric DNA distortions caused by many DNA lesions and thus are blocked (and/or misinsert bases inefficiently) opposite modified DNA adducts during replication. To cope with this replication barrier, organisms utilize TLS 2The abbreviations used are: TLS, translesion synthesis; Et, ethyl; Ib, isobutyl; Bz, benzyl; N2-Naph, N2-methyl(2-naphthyl); N2-Anth, N2-methyl(9-anthracenyl); N2-BP, N2-methyl(6-benzo[a]pyrenyl); BPDE, benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide; dCTPαS, 2′-deoxycytidine 5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate); MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; 8-oxoG, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroG; pol, DNA polymerase; RT, reverse transcriptase. 2The abbreviations used are: TLS, translesion synthesis; Et, ethyl; Ib, isobutyl; Bz, benzyl; N2-Naph, N2-methyl(2-naphthyl); N2-Anth, N2-methyl(9-anthracenyl); N2-BP, N2-methyl(6-benzo[a]pyrenyl); BPDE, benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide; dCTPαS, 2′-deoxycytidine 5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate); MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight; 8-oxoG, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroG; pol, DNA polymerase; RT, reverse transcriptase.

Although TLS DNA polymerases can readily accommodate and replicate through bulkier DNA lesions than replicative DNA polymerases, their synthesis can still be inhibited (or blocked) by certain DNA lesions, and bypass can be error-prone or error-free, depending on the adduct (7Prakash S.

N2-EtG and larger N2 -G adducts cause the strong blockage of polymerization by pol T7– and HIV-1 RT (17Choi J-Y. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol.

Guengerich F.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 72-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Pol ι has distinctive enzymatic properties in replicating four template bases with very different efficiencies and fidelities (19Tissier A. McDonald J.P. Frank E.G. Woodgate R.

Pol ι exhibits higher efficiencies of polymerization opposite purines (A and G; A being greater) than pyrimidines (C and T), and lower fidelities opposite T (lowest) and G than opposite A and C.

Pol ι has been proposed to bypass bulky minor groove purine lesions, such as N2-G adducts due to a unique Hoogsteen base-pairing mode opposite template purines in the active site (25Nair D.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Aggarwal A.K. Nature. 2004; 430: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 26Nair D.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Aggarwal A.K. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 1569-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, detailed kinetic evidence to support this view has not yet been presented. Recent reports suggest a possible role of pol ι in carcinogenesis. For instance, the pol ι gene has been shown to be a modifier of mouse lung tumorigenesis (27Wang M. Devereux T.R. Vikis H.G. McCulloch S.D. Holliday W. Anna C. Wang Y. Bebenek K. Kunkel T.A. Guan K. You M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1924-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Pol ι is overexpressed in certain types of human cancer samples and breast cancer cells, which may lead to reduction of DNA replication fidelity (28Albertella M.R. Lau A. O'Connor M.J. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2005; 4: 583-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 29Yang J. Chen Z. Liu Y. Hickey R.J. Malkas L.H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 5597-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The molecular size of DNA adducts, along with shape and chemical properties, may be a key differentiating factor in the blockage and misincorporation of DNA polymerases, which have confined active site pockets. The bulkiness of DNA adducts is important in understanding mechanisms of mutagenesis, especially caused by environmental chemicals (30Guengerich F.P. Chem.

We have previously studied some of the details of blockage and misincorporation with the model replicative DNA polymerases pol T7– and HIV-1 RT in work focused on various modifications of G at the C8 (8-oxoG), O6 (O6-MeG and O6-BzG), and N2 atoms (N2-MeG, N2-EtG, N2-IbG, N2-BzG, N2-AnthG, N2-(2,3,4-trihydroxy-1-butyl)G, 8-hydroxy-1, N2-propanoG, 8-hydroxy-6-methyl-1,N2-propanoG, and the styrene oxide and BPDE products formed at the G N2 atom) of guanine (17Choi J-Y.

Small adducts, such as 8-oxoG, O6-MeG, and N2-MeG, are bypassed fairly readily with some misincorporations, depending upon the polymerase (32Woodside A.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1027-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 33Woodside A.M. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1039-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 36Einolf H.J.

However, with other bulky adducts, the polymerase catalytic efficiency and fidelity are dramatically decreased. The effect of adduct size is consistently seen in one TLS polymerase, pol η, although pol η is more resistant to bulky adducts than pol T7– and HIV-1 RT (18Choi J-Y. Guengerich F.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 72-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In the present work, we systematically evaluated the effect of varying size at the guanine N2 atom in studying human pol ι, which has been proposed to bypass bulky N2-G adducts via a Hoogsteen base-pairing mode. We prepared site-specifically modified oligonucleotides containing N2-MeG, N2-EtG, N2,2N2-diMeG, N2-IbG, N2-BzG, N2-NaphG, N2-AnthG, and N2-BPG adducts (i.e. with gradually increasing size at the guanine N2-adduct) (Fig. 1) and used these with pol ι. Steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics were investigated, along with the features of DNA substrate and dNTP binding to pol ι. DNA polymerization by human pol ι is moderately tolerated up to the size of N2-BzG but strongly interfered with by bulk equal to or larger than N2-NaphG, in a size-dependent manner. The hydrophobicity increases along with bulk and may also be a contributing factor. The mechanism of interference is discussed in the context of the kinetic behavior of pol ι with bulky N2-G adducts.

Open table in a new tab Isolation of Human POLI cDNA and Construction of Recombinant Baculovirus—Human DNA polymerase ι cDNA was obtained by PCR amplification from human testis cDNA (as template) using Pfu ultra DNA polymerase with the corresponding two primers 5′-CTCGAGGCATGGAACTGGCGGACGT-3′ and 5′-TCCCTTGCTTTTCAGACCTT-3′. The resulting 2.2-kb PCR product of POLI was cloned into the vector pPCR-Script Amp, and nucleotide sequencing was done to confirm the entire sequence of the coding region. The fragment containing the human POLI gene was cloned into the XhoI and NotI sites of the vector pAcHLT-B to generate a fusion tag containing six histidines at the N terminus, yielding the vector pAcHLT/HPOLI. This plasmid was co-transfected into Sf9 insect cells with BaculoGold DNA using a BaculoGold transfection kit to generate the recombinant baculovirus expressing human pol ι. Expression and Purification of Human DNA Polymerases—Recombinant human pol ι was expressed in Sf9 insect cells (2 × 109 cells) with the amplified recombinant baculovirus for 60 h. The harvested cell pellets were lysed in 100 ml of Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture). The cell debris was removed by ultracentrifugation at 105 × g for 60 min. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto a 5-ml HisTrap column (Amersham Biosciences) and washed sequentially with 50 ml of buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 20 mm imidazole and then with 50 ml of Buffer B containing 40 mm imidazole and finally with 50 ml of Buffer B containing 50 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were eluted with 400 mm imidazole in Buffer B. Eluted proteins were dialyzed against Buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 10% (v/v) glycerol and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and loaded onto a 1-ml MonoQ column (Amersham Biosciences). Pol ι was eluted with a 30-ml linear gradient of 0–1.0 M NaCl in Buffer C. Eluted fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with silver staining (39Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2491) Google Scholar), and pol ι was found to be eluted at 100 mm NaCl. Pooled pol ι fractions were concentrated using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device to a volume of 100 μl and were further purified to near homogeneity using a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) with Buffer C containing 150 mm NaCl (see supplemental data). The active enzyme concentration of pol ι was determined by the active site titration method described below. Recombinant human pol η was prepared as described previously (18Choi J-Y. Guengerich F.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 72-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Reaction Conditions for Enzyme Assays—Unless indicated otherwise, standard DNA polymerase reactions were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml (w/v), and 10% glycerol (v/v) with 100 nm primer-template at 37 °C. Primers were 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ-32P]ATP and annealed with template (36-mer). All reactions were initiated by the addition of dNTP and MgCl2 (5 mm final concentration) to preincubated enzyme/DNA mixtures. Primer Extension Assay with All Four dNTPs—A 32P-labeled primer, annealed to either an unmodified or adducted template, was extended in the presence of all four dNTPs (100 μm each) for 15 min. Reaction mixtures (8 μl) were quenched with 2 volumes of a solution of 20 mm EDTA in 95% formamide (v/v). Products were resolved using a 16% polyacrylamide (w/v) gel electrophoresis system containing 8 m urea and visualized with a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Steady-state Reactions—A 32P-labeled primer, annealed to either an unmodified or adducted template, was extended in the presence of increasing concentrations of a single dNTP. The molar ratio of primer-template to enzyme was at least 10:1. Enzyme concentrations and reaction times were chosen so that maximal product formation would be ≤20% of the substrate concentration (40Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The primer-template was extended with dNTP in the presence of 0.1–5 nm enzyme for 5 or 10 min. All reactions (8 μl) were done at 10 dNTP concentrations (in duplicate) and quenched with 2 volumes of a solution of 20 mm EDTA in 95% formamide (v/v). Products were resolved using a 16% polyacrylamide (w/v) electrophoresis gel containing 8 m urea and quantitated by phosphorimaging analysis using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX instrument and Quantity One software. Graphs of product formation versus dNTP concentration were fit using nonlinear regression (hyperbolic fits) in GraphPad Prism version 3.0 (San Diego, CA) for the determination of kcat and Km values. Pre-steady-state Reactions—Rapid quench experiments were performed using a model RQF-3 KinTek Quench Flow Apparatus (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). Reactions were initiated by rapid mixing of 32P-primer-template/polymerase mixtures (12.5 μl) with the dNTP-Mg2+ complex (10.9 μl) and then quenched with 0.3 m EDTA after times varying from 5 ms to 4 s (or 30 s for N2-IbG-, N2-NaphG-, and N2-AnthG-containing oligonucleotides). Reactions were mixed with 450 μl of formamide-dye solution (20 mm EDTA, 95% formamide (v/v), 0.5% bromphenol blue (w/v), and 0.05% xylene cyanol (w/v)) and run on a denaturing electrophoresis gel, with quantitation as described for the steady-state reactions. Pre-steady-state experiments were fit with the burst equation y = A(1–e–kpt) + ksst, where y represents the concentration of product, A is burst amplitude, kp is pre-steady-state rate of nucleotide incorporation, t is time, and kss is the steady-state rate of nucleotide incorporation (not normalized for enzyme concentration in the equation) (41Patel S.S.

Phosphorothioate Analysis—With the 32P-primer annealed to either an unmodified or adducted template, reactions were initiated by rapid mixing of 32P-primer-template/polymerase mixtures (12.5 μl) with Sp-dCTPαS-Mg2+ complex (or dCTP-Mg2+) (10.9 μl) and then quenched with 0.3m EDTA after reaction times varying from 5 ms to 4 s (or 30 s for N2-AnthG-containing DNA). Products were analyzed as described for the pre-steady-state reactions mentioned earlier. DNA Dissociation from Pol ι koff Measurements—DNA dissociation rates from the polymerase-oligonucleotide complex (E·DNA) were determined using a rapid quench-flow apparatus (33Woodside A.M.

Preincubated solutions of pol ι (350 nm) and unlabeled target DNA (24-mer/36-mer; 50 nm) were rapidly mixed with 32P-labeled 24-mer/36-G-mer (450 nm) for times of 0.8–4 s, and then polymerization was initiated by the addition of 1 mm dNTP-Mg2+ from the central drive syringe, for a constant reaction time of 0.5 s. Expelled samples from the apparatus were rapidly mixed into tubes containing 500 μl of 0.3 m EDTA (in 50% formamide (v/v)) to stop the reaction. Products were quantified by gel electrophoretic analysis. Graphs of nm product versus time were fit using the equation, y = Ef + E0 (1–e–kt), where y represents the concentration of product, Ef is the free enzyme concentration, E0 is the DNA-bound enzyme concentration, koff is the dissociation rate of DNA from E·DNA, and t is time (33Woodside A.M.

Active Site Titration and Determination of KdDNA—The KdDNA for productive binding of pol ι to 24-mer/36-mer DNA substrates was determined using pre-steady-state analysis. Pol ι, preincubated with increasing concentrations of the DNA substrate in sample syringe A, was mixed with saturating dCTP-Mg2+ from sample syringe B and then quenched with 0.3 m EDTA after times of 0.5 s. A graph of the burst amplitude versus total DNA concentration was plotted and fit to a quadratic equation, A = 0.5(Kd + Et + Dt) – [(0.25(Kd + Et + Dt)2 – EtDt)]1/2, where A represents burst amplitude, Et is the active enzyme concentration, Dt is DNA concentration, and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant for productive DNA binding (41Patel S.S.

Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) in GraphPad Prism version 3.0. Determination of KddCTP—KdDNA was estimated by performing pre-steady-state reactions at different dNTP concentrations with reaction times varying from 5 ms to 4 s. A graph of the burst rate (kobs) versus dCTP concentration was fit to the hyperbolic equation, kobs = kpol[dNTP]/([dNTP] + Kd), where kpol represents the maximal rate of nucleotide incorporation and KddCTP is the equilibrium dissociation constant for dCTP (41Patel S.S.

Primer Extension by Human Pol ι in the Presence of All Four dNTPs— Processive polymerization by human pol ι at various N2-G adducts, in the presence of all four dNTPs, was analyzed in “standing start” assays using 24-mer/36-mer duplexes containing G and each of seven different N2-G adducts (Fig. 1) at position 25 of the template (Fig. 2). Pol ι readily extended the 24-mer primer annealed to the unmodified G, N2-MeG, and N2-EtG templates in proportion to the concentration of enzyme, mainly up to 27- and 28-mer products (with some 25-, 26-, 29-, 30-, and 31-mer products) but yielded no full-length 36-mer products. Polymerization with N2-IbG and N2-BzG derivatives yielded a pattern of extension similar to unmodified G but partially blocked in the steps of incorporation opposite the lesion (N2-IbG and N2-BzG) and/or the subsequent extension (N2-BzG). The polymerization of N2-NaphG, N2 -AnthG, and N2-BPG yielded only 1-base extension products, indicating that pol ι was strongly blocked at the site of those lesions and the subsequent extension step.

https://openalex.org/W1998396637,"Even in small molecules, the influence of electronic state on rotational and vibrational product energies is not well understood. Here, we use experiments and theory to address this issue in photodissociation of formaldehyde, H2CO, to the radical products H + HCO. These products result from dissociation from the singlet ground electronic state or the first excited triplet state (T1) of H2CO. Fluorescence spectra reveal a sudden decrease in the HCO rotational energy with increasing photolysis energy accompanied by substantial HCO vibrational excitation. Calculations of the rotational distribution using an ab initio potential energy surface for the T1 state are in very good agreement with experiment and strongly support dominance of the T1 state in the dynamics at the higher photolysis energies."

Tid1 is a human homolog of bacterial DnaJ and the Tid56 tumor suppressor of Drosophila melanogaster. DnaJ-like proteins function as co-chaperones with DnaK-like ATPases to promote the folding, translocation, and/or degradation of polypeptides (1Bukau B. Horwich A.

DnaJ- and DnaK-like proteins are highly conserved, and homologs are found in nearly every compartment of the eukaryotic cell and in several tumor viruses (4Kelley W.L. Georgopoulos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, the absence of Tid56 results in abnormal differentiation and morphogenesis, giving rise to Tumorous imaginal discs that lead to lethality during early development (5Kurzik-Dumke U. Gundacker D. Renthrop M. Gateff E. Dev. Genet. 1995; 16: 64-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying Tid56 function is unknown. In humans, two alternatively spliced forms of Tid1 are expressed, Tid1-long (Tid1-L) and Tid1-short (Tid1-S), that differ only at their carboxyl-terminal tails (Fig. 1A) (6Syken J. De-Medina T.

Tid1-L contains 33 amino acids unique to its carboxyl terminus, whereas Tid1-S has 6 amino acids (Fig. 1A). Both Tid1-L and -S have a predicted amino-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence as well as the signature J-domain carrying an HPD motif required for stimulating the ATPase activity of eukaryotic DnaK-like chaperones (1Bukau B.

The described functions of Tid1 include modulation of cell death and proliferation, in addition to participation in signaling pathways that are mediated, for example, by Jak2, NFκB, Ras GTPase-activating protein, and Trk receptor tyrosine kinases. These findings raise several fundamental questions that remain unanswered. Do Tid1 proteins function as mitochondrial DnaJ-like chaperones? Do Tid1-L and -S behave identically or differently, and do they interact with one another? What potential mechanism(s) determine whether Tid1 functions inside or outside mitochondria? In this study we demonstrate that Tid1 proteins exhibit a conserved mitochondrial DnaJ-like function, substituting for the yeast mitochondrial DnaJ-like protein Mdj1p in a J-domain-dependent manner. Like Mdj1p, Tid1-L and -S localize to human mitochondrial nucleoids, which are large protein complexes associated with mtDNA. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using isoform-specific antibodies show that unlike other DnaJ-like proteins described thus far, cellular Tid1-L and -S are present not only in an unassembled state but also as heterocomplexes. Pulse-chase analysis demonstrates that Tid1-L has a significantly longer residency time in the cytosol prior to mitochondrial import, in contrast to Tid1-S. Consistent with these findings, mutants of Tid1-L and -S lacking their amino-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequences (N-65L and N-65S, respectively) exhibit different fates in the cytosol. N-65L is relatively stable, whereas N-65S is rapidly degraded. These observations suggest that the increased cytosolic residency time and stability of Tid1-L may be explained by protein-protein interactions outside mitochondria. Results from two-step immunoprecipitation reactions show that unassembled Tid1-L interacts with cytosolic Hsc70, whereas Tid1-S does not. Unassembled Tid1-L also associates with the cytosolic STAT1 and STAT3. We show that the unique carboxyl terminus of Tid1-L is necessary for interactions with Hsc70 and the potential substrates STAT1 and STAT3. Collectively, these results support the model that the fate and function of Tid1 proteins both inside and outside of mitochondria are influenced by cytosolic protein interactions. Antibodies—Antisera specifically recognizing the unique carboxyl termini of Tid1-L or -S were produced in rabbits and affinity-purified (αL and αS, respectively). Antibodies recognizing both Tid1 isoforms, referred to as αTid1 (MS-1564, Neomarkers; and sc-1882, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Cox2 (Molecular Probes), Hsc70 (SPA-816, StressGen), mtHsp70 (MA3-028, Affinity Bioreagents), the Myc epitope (sc-40, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), STAT1, STAT3, and tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 (610186, 610190 and 612133, respectively, BD Transduction Laboratories) were also used in this study.

In Vitro Mutagenesis and Plasmids—Tid1 variants were engineered by PCR-based mutagenesis. For expression in mammalian cells, Tid1 cDNAs were cloned into pCDNA3.1 or pIRES2-EGFP; for expression in yeast, Tid1 cDNAs were cloned into pYC2/CT.

Suppression of the temperature-sensitive mdj1-5 growth defect was assayed by growing transformed strains to mid-log phase in selective galactose-containing medium, adjusting the liquid culture to the same cell density, spotting yeast onto medium containing the nonfermentable carbon sources ethanol and glycerol (YPEG), and incubating the yeast at the permissive (30 °C) or nonpermissive (37 °C) temperatures. mdj1-5 and Δmdj1 were provided by Dr. Elisabeth Schwarz (University of Halle, Germany). Cell Culture—COS-7, 293-T, or U2OS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin (complete DMEM) at 37 °C. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. For induction of STAT1 phosphorylation, U2OS cells were treated with or without IFN-γ (1,000 units/ml; Roche Applied Science) for 15 min or with interleukin-6 (IL-6, 20 ng/ml; PeproTech) for 30 min at 37 °C. Mitochondrial Nucleoids—Mitochondrial nucleoids were isolated from HEK293EBNA cells as described previously (25Garrido N. Griparic L. Jokitalo E. Wartiovaara J. van der Bliek A.M. Spelbrink J.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1583-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria were thawed on ice, resuspended in NE2 buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and diluted with an equal volume of 0.5× NE2 buffer to a final concentration of 5–7 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml. Spermidine (1.0 m) was added to a final concentration of 3 mm, and mitochondria were lysed by adding 20% Nonidet P-40 to a final concentration of 0.5%. After gentle stirring for 15 min, the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min resulting in a supernatant (S0) and pellet (P0) fraction. P0 was resuspended in NE2 buffer as above; S0 and P0 were layered on top of step gradients composed of 3.5 ml of 20%, 2.5 ml of 40%, 1.8 ml of 60%, and 0.9 ml of 75% sucrose in gradient buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm spermidine, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 111,000 × g for 75 min. The resulting gradient fractions (S1 and P1) were analyzed for distribution of mtDNA and protein. mtDNA containing fractions from P1 were collected, diluted with 2 volumes of ice-cold gradient buffer, treated again with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 15 min, and centrifuged through a second step gradient at 49,000 × g for 3 h to yield S2 and P2. Mitochondrial nucleoids were isolated in P2. Immunoblotting, Immunoprecipitation, and Metabolic Labeling—The methods used have been described previously (26Lu B. Liu T. Crosby J.A. Wohlever J.T. Lee I. Suzuki C.K. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cellular protein was extracted in lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), NaF (1 mm), and Na3VO4 (1 mm). Immunoblotting was carried out using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, cell extracts were incubated with antibody overnight at 4 °C; protein A-agarose was added, incubated for 4 h at 4 °C, and washed three times with wash buffer. Sequential two-step immunoprecipitations were performed as follows. In the first step, cell extracts or mitochondrial extracts were immunoprecipitated with isoform-specific antibodies recognizing the unique carboxyl terminus of Tid1-S (αS) or -L (αL) to determine whether the other isoform was co-precipitated. In the second step, the unbound extract was immunoprecipitated with αL or αS to determine whether unassembled isoforms were present. Metabolic labeling was performed by incubating cells in methionine-free DMEM for 30 min prior to replacement with methionine-free DMEM containing [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml; Trans35S-Label, ICN) for the time as indicated; cells were chased in complete DMEM. Radiolabeled protein was immunoprecipitated and visualized by autoradiography. Fluorescence Microscopy—Fluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (26Lu B. Liu T. Crosby J.A. Wohlever J.T. Lee I. Suzuki C.K. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 306: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). For indirect immunofluorescence, cells adhered to coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with either 0.1% Triton X-100 or acetone. Incubations with primary antibody were at room temperature followed by incubations with Cy-2- or Cy-3-conjugated secondary antibodies. Mitochondrial staining was carried out using MitoTracker Green or MitoTracker Red (500 nm; Molecular Probes). Tid1-L and -S Are Conserved Mitochondrial DnaJ-like Proteins—The function of mitochondrial DnaJ-like chaperones is best understood in Saccharomyces cerevisiae; the yeast mitochondrial DnaJ-like protein Mdj1p is essential for the quality control of matrix proteins and for the metabolism of mtDNA. A chaperone system that includes Mdj1p, mitochondrial Hsp70 (mtHsp70, also referred to as Ssc1p), and the mitochondrial nucleotide exchange factor GrpE (Mge1p) prevents protein aggregation and promotes the folding or degradation of non-native polypeptides. Mdj1p is also present in large protein-mtDNA complexes, called mitochondrial nucleoids, and is important for maintaining the mtDNA polymerase in an active conformation during cell stress (27Germaniuk A. Liberek K. Marszalek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27801-27808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 28Duchniewicz M. Germaniuk A. Westermann B. Neupert W. Schwarz E. Marszalek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8201-8210Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As there are no functional assays for mitochondrial DnaJ-like activities in mammalian cells, we examined whether Tid1 proteins substituted for Mdj1p in yeast. Tid1-L and -S were expressed in a mutant strain mdj1-5 that produces a temperature-sensitive variant of Mdj1p. At 30 °C mdj1-5 exhibits wild type growth, and at 37 °C mdj1-5 fails to grow on the nonfermentable carbon sources ethanol and glycerol that require mitochondrial function. Expression of either Tid1-L or -S alone suppressed the growth defect of mdj1-5 at 37 °C (Fig. 1B); thus Tid1 proteins functionally replace Mdj1p in the folding and degradation of mitochondrial proteins. Deletion of the amino-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence of Tid1 from amino acids 1 to 65 as predicted by PSORT (N-65L or N-65S) abolished Mdj1p-like activity (Fig. 1B); Tid1 import into the mitochondrial matrix was therefore required for suppression of the mdj1-5 growth defect. Not all mammalian mitochondrial targeting sequences are functional in yeast; however, the native amino-terminal sequence of Tid1 was able to direct efficient import into yeast mitochondria. Mutational analyses of various DnaJ-like proteins demonstrate that the HPD motif within the J-domain is essential for stimulating the ATPase activity of a cognate DnaK-like protein (29Tsai J. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9347-9354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). J-domain mutants of Tid1 were engineered in which the conserved histidine at position 121 was replaced by a glutamine (LH121Q or SH121Q). When expressed in mdj1-5, LH121Q and SH121Q failed to suppress the respiration-dependent growth defect at 37 °C (Fig. 1B), suggesting that Tid1-L and -S cooperate with mtHsp70. Successive truncation of the unique carboxyl terminus of Tid1-L did not interfere with suppression of the mdj1-5 growth defect (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that the unique carboxyl terminus of Tid1 proteins was not essential for Mdj1p-like function. The inability of the N-65 or J-domain mutants to substitute for Mdj1p was not attributed to a lack of protein expression. All mutant Tid1 proteins were expressed in mdj1-5 cells at similar levels with the exception of N-65L, which was consistently detected at higher levels for reasons that we do not understand (Fig. 1B). Previous work has shown that Mdj1p is predominantly associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane (24Westermann B. Gaume B. Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Schwarz E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7063-7071Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Rowley N. Prip-Buus C. Westermann B. Brown C. Schwarz E. Barrell B. Neupert W. Cell. 1994; 77: 249-259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and bound to mtDNA (27Germaniuk A. Liberek K. Marszalek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27801-27808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed to determine the submitochondrial distribution of Tid1 in human cells. Mitochondria were purified using the procedure of Spelbrink and co-workers (25Garrido N. Griparic L. Jokitalo E. Wartiovaara J. van der Bliek A.M. Spelbrink J.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1583-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In mitochondrial extracts from HEK293EBNA cells using 0.5% Triton X-100, 4–5-fold more Tid1-S than Tid1-L was observed; a similar ratio of Tid1-S to Tid1-L was detected in whole cell extracts (see Fig. 2, C and D). To determine the submitochondrial localization of Tid1, mitochondria were lysed with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and the resulting lysates were centrifuged. Tid1 distributed to the pellet fraction (P0) and was not detected in the supernatant (S0) (Fig. 2A, left panel). In a similar manner, the nucleoid marker mitochondrial TFAM distributed to the pellet fraction and was not detected in the supernatant. The S0 and P0 fractions were subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation (1° gradient) resulting in supernatant (S1) and pellet (P1) fractions. Immunoblotting results showed that after the 1° gradient, Tid1, TFAM, and the mitochondrial inner membrane marker Cox2 (cytochrome c oxidase II) distributed to the P1 fractions (Fig. 2, A and B), which contained mtDNA (data not shown). The P1 fractions were pooled and treated for a second time with Nonidet P-40 and then subjected to a second sucrose gradient centrifugation (2° gradient), which was required to separate inner membrane proteins such as Cox2 from the nucleoid components TFAM and mtDNA. After the 2° gradient, Tid1-L and -S co-purified with the nucleoid marker TFAM in the pellet fractions (P2, f19, and f20) (Fig. 2A) and were not found with the inner membrane marker Cox2 in the supernatant (S2) (Fig. 2B). Tid1 proteins like Mdj1p are localized to the inner membrane and co-purify with mitochondrial nucleoids. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Tid1-L and -S exhibit a conserved chaperone activity in yeast and behave as mitochondrial DnaJ-like proteins in cultured human cells, which co-purify with mitochondrial nucleoids. Hetero-oligomeric as Well as Unassembled Tid1-L and -S Are Observed in Cultured Cells—To investigate the assembly state of Tid1-L and -S, two-step immunoprecipitations were performed. To determine the levels of complexed and unassembled Tid1-L, cell extracts were first immunoprecipitated with isoform-specific antibodies recognizing the unique carboxyl terminus of Tid1-S (αS) to determine whether the long isoform was co-precipitated; the unbound extract was then subjected to a second sequential immunoprecipitation using antibodies recognizing the unique carboxyl terminus of Tid1-L (αL) to determine whether unassembled Tid1-L was present. Using the same protocol, complexed and unassembled Tid1-S were also determined by sequential immunoprecipitations except that αL was used in the first step and αS in the second step (Fig. 2, C–E). The isoform specificity of these antibodies was demonstrated as shown in supplemental Fig. 1. In whole cell extracts as well as in mitochondrial extracts from HEK293EBNA cells, Tid1-L and -S were found to co-immunoprecipitate with one another in the first step (Fig. 2, C and D, lanes 2 and 4). Densitometric analysis suggested that the stoichiometry of long and short isoforms in Tid1 heterocomplexes was 1:1 in HEK293EBNA whole cell and mitochondrial extracts (Fig. 2, C and D, compare lanes 2 and 4). Sequential second step immunoprecipitation demonstrated that unassembled Tid1-L and -S were also present in both whole cell and mitochondrial extracts (Fig. 2, C and D, lanes 3 and 5). In HEK293EBNA cells, the level of Tid1-S was 4–5-fold greater than Tid1-L in both whole cell extracts and in mitochondria (Fig. 2, C and D, lanes 1). We observed that the relative levels of Tid1-L and -S vary depending on the cell line assayed. For example, in U2OS cells, the ratio of Tid1-L and -S is essentially 1:1 (Fig. 2E, lane 1). Two-step immunoprecipitations using U2OS cell extracts demonstrated that Tid1-L and -S were also found in both a hetero-oligomeric complex as well as in an unassembled state (Fig. 2E, lanes 2–5). In U2OS cells, densitometric analysis suggested that the stoichiometry of long and short isoforms in Tid1 heterocomplexes in this cell line was between 2:1 and 1:1 (Fig. 2E, compare lanes 2 and 4). Tid1-L Has a Longer Cytosolic Residency Time Prior to Mitochondrial Import and Greater Cytosolic Stability as Compared with Tid1-S—The biosynthesis and fate of Tid1-L and -S were examined by metabolic labeling pulse-chase analysis and fluorescence microscopy. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that endogenous as well as overexpressed Tid1 were predominantly localized to mitochondria (Fig. 3, A and B). In U2OS cells, endogenous Tid1-L and -S co-localized with the mitochondrial dye Mitotracker Green (Fig. 3A). Similarly, in COS-7 cells, overexpressed Tid1-L and -S co-localized with Mitotracker (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. 2). Pulse-chase analysis demonstrated that Tid1-L and -S were synthesized as full-length precursor proteins that were post-translationally processed to the mature mitochondrial form (Fig. 3D). COS-7 cells overexpressing Tid1-L or -S were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min and then chased for up to 12 h. Immunoprecipitation of Tid1 showed that the precursor of Tid1-S was efficiently imported into mitochondria; in the pulse, 55% of newly synthesized Tid1-S was already processed to the mature mitochondrial form. By contrast, the precursor of Tid1-L was processed more slowly; in the pulse 84% of the newly synthesized Tid1-L was present as the precursor form, and even after a 12-h chase the precursor protein was still detectable. Once imported into mitochondria, both Tid1-L and -S were for the most part stable. The cytosolic stability of Tid1-L and -S was addressed by analyzing the half-life of cytosolic Tid1 mutants N-65L and N-65S lacking their respective mitochondrial targeting sequences. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that little if any overexpressed N-65L and N-65S co-localization with Mitotracker (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. 2); rather, these proteins were distributed throughout the cytosol co-localizing with cytosolic green fluorescent protein (data not shown). Pulse-chase experiments showed that N-65S was rapidly turned over; after a 30-min pulse and a 2-h chase, little if any N-65S was observed (Fig. 3E, left panel). By contrast, N-65L exhibited a significantly longer half-life; after a 12-h chase, N-65L was still present (Fig. 3E, right panel). The unique carboxyl terminus of Tid1-L thus confers increased stability outside mitochondria. Taken together, these data suggested the possibility that Tid1-L may interact with cytosolic proteins resulting in protease resistance, either by blocking degradation or promoting the folded state. The interaction of Tid1-L with cytosolic proteins may also explain the slower mitochondrial import kinetics of Tid1-L as compared with Tid1-S as shown in Fig. 3D. Hsc70 Interacts with Unassembled Tid1-L—In bacteria and eukaryotes, DnaJ-like proteins have been shown to physically interact with DnaK-like (Hsp70-like) proteins, which function together as a chaperone system in the folding, translocation, and degradation of unfolded polypeptides (1Bukau B.

Observations of these signatures by Cassini's Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument allow remote monitoring of Enceladus' gas and dust environments. This reveals substantial outgassing variability at the moon and suggests increased dust concentrations at its Lagrange points.

The model postulates at least two conformations of a transporter, an outward and an inward facing conformation, which seal the translocation pathway to the interior and exterior of the cell, respectively. It is not clear how the conformational switch is triggered in neurotransmitter/sodium symporters, but Na+ is likely to play an essential role.

Binding experiments with the inhibitor 2β-[3H]carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)tropane (β-[3H]CIT) supported the conjecture that the mutant transporters preferentially adopted the inward facing conformation: β-[3H]CIT interacted with SERT in a manner consistent with binding to the outward facing state. Accordingly, the Na+-induced acceleration of β-[3H]CIT association was most pronounced in wild-type SERT, followed by SERT-E136D > SERT-E136Q > SERT-E136A. Similarly, SERT-E136Q supported substrate efflux in a manner indistinguishable from wild-type SERT, whereas SERT-E136A was inactive.

Efficient neurotransmission is contingent on reuptake of neurotransmitters, which allow for rapid retrieval of the signaling molecule or, in the case of acetylcholine, its breakdown product into the presynaptic specialization (1Rudnick G.

Saier Jr., M.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 37: 287-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The monoamine transporters, i.e. the transporters for serotonin (SERT), dopamine (DAT), and norepinephrine (NET), belong to the NSS family, which also comprises, among others, the transporters for glycine, γ-aminobutyric acid, and choline (4Torres G.E. Gainetdinov R.R. Caron M.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar).

However, despite a conserved overall topology and extensive homology, TM2 of SERT differs substantially from those of GAT1 and DAT. Specifically, SERT does not contain a canonical leucine heptad repeat; the second leucine in GAT1 is Ala125 in SERT. In addition, if TM2 is assumed to adopt an α-helical conformation, there is a glycine residue (Gly128) in SERT one helical turn below Ala125. Together, these two residues create a large cavity that precludes any leucine heptad repeat-stabilized oligomeric interaction. Accordingly, the oligomeric structure of SERT is stabilized by an interface of SERT comprising TM11 and TM12 (12Just H. Sitte H.H. Schmid J.A. Freissmuth M. Kudlacek O. J. Biol.

This allowed us examine the role of the highly conserved glutamate residue (Glu136) in TM2 of SERT without the confounding effect on oligomeric assembly and endoplasmic reticulum export. Our experiments show that, in SERT, Glu136 plays a pivotal role in regulating the transport cycle because it is required to afford the outward facing conformation. Substitutions with closely related amino acids sufficed to impair the translocation process, and the resulting mutant transporters accumulated in a state that was consistent with their being in the inward facing conformation.

Chem. 2001; 276: 3805-3810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange II (Invitrogen). Transient transfection of cells (2-20 μg of plasmid DNA) was achieved following the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Epifluorescence Microscopy—The subcellular localization of SERT molecules tagged with YFP was examined by fluorescence microscopy (11Korkhov V.M. Farhan H. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55728-55736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In brief, 0.3 × 106 HEK293 cells were seeded onto a 15-mm glass coverslip coated with poly-d-lysine. The next day, cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding either YFP-tagged wild-type SERT or appropriate mutants thereof; after 24 h, YFP-tagged proteins were visualized in living cells using a Zeiss Axiovert M200 epifluorescence microscope. [3H]Serotonin Uptake and Release Experiments—The procedures for uptake and superfusion experiments with radioactively labeled serotonin have been described previously (6Scholze P. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43682-43690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Uptake of serotonin was determined as follows. Cells (5 × 105) stably expressing SERT were incubated for 1 min at 22 °C in Krebs-HEPES buffer (120 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgSO4, 20 mm dextrose (final pH 7.35), and 10 mm HEPES (pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH)) with 2 μCi of [3H]serotonin in the absence (total uptake) and presence (nonspecific uptake) of 1 μm paroxetine. The specific activity was adjusted with unlabeled serotonin to vary between 15 cpm/fmol and 50 cpm/pmol. After 1 min, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were rapidly rinsed with 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Uptake experiments with radiolabeled [3H]serotonin were done in parallel in triplicate under identical conditions (cells seeded in parallel and same incubation time and washing procedure). The procedure for measuring release has been described in detail (16Sitte H.H. Hiptmair B. Zwach J. Pifl C. Singer E.A. Scholze P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were grown overnight on poly-d-lysine-coated round glass coverslips and preincubated in the presence of 0.4 μm [3H]serotonin for 60 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 0.1 ml of buffer. Coverslips were then transferred to superfusion chambers (0.2 ml) and superfused with Krebs-HEPES buffer at 25 °C and a perfusion rate of 0.7 ml/min. After a washout period of 45 min to establish stable efflux of radioactivity, the experiment was started with collection of 2-min fractions. The buffers were switched to sodium-free buffer after 6 min (NaCl replaced with choline HCl) as indicated in the figure legends. The pH of the sodium-free buffer was adjusted with Tris base. After 18 min, p-chloroamphetamine (PCA; 10 μm, dissolved in H2O) was added to each buffer. At the end of the experiment, cells were lysed in 1% SDS, and the amount of tritium remaining in the cells was determined. The release of 3H is expressed as fractional rate, i.e. the radioactivity released during a fraction is expressed as a percentage of the total radioactivity present in the cells at the beginning of that fraction. All comparisons of wild-type and mutant SERTs were done in parallel. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy—A Zeiss Axiovert 200-LSM 510 confocal microscope equipped with an argon laser (30 milliwatts), a helium/neon laser (1 milliwatt), and an oil immersion objective (Zeiss Plan-Neofluar 40×/1.3) was used. Transiently transfected cells were plated on glass coverslips (3-cm diameter) and covered with Krebs-Ringer-HEPES buffer (0.1 ml). The thickness of the optical sections was between 0.8 and 1.5 μm (frame scan). Cell-surface expression was assayed by staining the cell surface with the fluorescent dye trypan blue as described by Oksche and co-workers (17Wuller S. Wiesner B. Loffler A. Furkert J. Krause G. Hermosilla R. Schaefer M. Schulein R. Rosenthal W. Oksche A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47254-47263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-tagged constructs were detected with a band pass filter (475-525 nm) using the 458-nm laser line at 30-45% input power. The plasma membrane was visualized after addition of 20 μl of trypan blue (0.05% in phosphate-buffered saline) at an excitation wavelength of 543 nm with a long pass filter (585 nm). CFP and trypan blue images were captured sequentially, and the overlay images were produced with Zeiss imaging software. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was also recorded on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser scanning microscope. Circular regions of interest were specified for bleaching (bleach regions). Before bleaching, a whole frame scan was obtained; the area of interest was then bleached (70 iterations) at maximum laser power (at 558 nm). Subsequently, pictures were captured (40 scans). The recorded fluorescence intensities were digitized and averaged over the bleach region using Image J equipped with plugins from the Wright Cell Imaging Facility (available at www.uhnresearch.ca/facilities/wcif/index.htm) after correction for nonspecific bleaching of the remaining cell area and background fluorescence. The corrected values obtained were plotted and subjected to nonlinear curve fitting to an equation describing the monoexponential rise to a maximum: y = bottom + (top - bottom)·(1 - e-kx), where “bottom” refers to the relative fluorescence intensity immediately after bleaching (before recovery) and “top” refers to the value reached at equilibrium (after recovery). The half-time for fluorescence recovery in the bleach region was calculated from the estimate of k. β-[3H]CIT Binding Assays—Equilibrium binding of β-[3H]CIT was determined as described (12Just H. Sitte H.H. Schmid J.A. Freissmuth M. Kudlacek O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6650-6657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) in a reaction volume of 0.1 or 0.2 ml with minor modifications. For association kinetics measurements, the membrane preparations (10 μg/assay) were incubated with the radioligand (2-10 nm β-[3H]CIT) in 20 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4) with NaCl, KCl, and choline HCl at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends. Nonspecific binding was defined in parallel incubations done in the presence of 1 μm paroxetine; at 10 nm radioligand and 120 mm NaCl, it was <10% of total equilibrium binding regardless of whether wild-type or mutant SERT was investigated. The incubation time was varied between 2 and 120 min, and the reaction was terminated by rapid filtration over glass-fiber filters. The radioactivity trapped on the filter was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. The on-rate (kapp) was determined by fitting the data by nonlinear regression to an equation describing a single exponential association. To assess the kinetics of β-[3H]CIT dissociation, association of the radioligand (2-10 nm) was allowed to proceed for 1 h. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was diluted 100-fold in 20 mm Tris-HCl and 1 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4) with NaCl, KCl, and choline HCl at the concentrations indicated in the figure legends, and aliquots of the diluted mixture were filtered at successive time points. The koff values were determined by fitting the data to an equation describing monoexponential decay. All data are reported as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA followed by Scheffe's post hoc test (where appropriate, as indicated below or in the figure legends). Cell-surface Expression of the Mutant Serotonin Transporters—Glu136 in SERT is invariant in all Na+-dependent neurotransmitter symporters and is also found in many distantly related transporters (including archaeal and bacterial transporters) (18Androutsellis-Theotokis A. Goldberg N.R. Ueda K. Beppu T. Beckman M.L. Das S. Javitch J.A. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12703-12709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In GAT1, mutation of this residue results in loss of oligomer formation; hence, the mutant transporters are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. TM2 of SERT differs substantially from that of GAT1. To explore the role of Glu136 in SERT, we replaced it with a residue of equal charge, an isosteric residue, and a residue devoid of any hydrogen bond-donating side chain, resulting in mutants SERT-E136D, SERT-E136Q, and SERT-E136A, respectively. Upon expression in HEK293 cells, the three YFP-tagged mutant transporters were visualized at the cell surface by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1A). In fact, cells expressing mutant SERT were indistinguishable from those expressing wild-type SERT. Specific uptake of [3H]serotonin was detectable in cells expressing SERT-E136D (Fig. 1B, ▴), but not in those expressing SERT-E136A and SERT-E136Q (Fig. 1B, ▾ and ♦, respectively). Epifluorescence microscopy is well suited to visualize the distribution of fluorescently tagged proteins. However, it is not possible to rule out that the SERT mutants were trapped in a submembranous compartment and that defective membrane insertion accounted for the reduction or loss of substrate influx. We addressed this issue by two approaches: (i) confocal microscopy using trypan blue (17Wuller S. Wiesner B. Loffler A. Furkert J. Krause G. Hermosilla R. Schaefer M. Schulein R. Rosenthal W. Oksche A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47254-47263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and (ii) fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. The membrane-impermeable dye trypan blue binds to the outer leaflet of the cell membrane and emits a strong fluorescence at >585 nm (17Wuller S. Wiesner B. Loffler A. Furkert J. Krause G. Hermosilla R. Schaefer M. Schulein R. Rosenthal W. Oksche A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47254-47263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The differences in the fluorescence spectrum between trypan blue and CFP are large. Thus, trypan blue is ideally suited to visualize the cell surface of cells that have been transfected to express surface molecules tagged with CFP. In confocal images, we observed extensive co-localization of the fluorescence emitted by trypan blue (Fig. 2, middle panels) with that of wild-type and mutant SERTs at the cell surface (upper panels); this is readily evident from the overlays shown in Fig. 2 (lower panels). When compared with transporters confined to vesicles (submembranous), transporters residing in the plasma membrane are predicted to have extensive lateral mobility. We tested this by bleaching the CFP moiety attached to SERT (Fig. 3A), SERT-E136A (Fig. 3B), SERT-E136D (Fig. 3C), and SERT-E136Q (Fig. 3D) at the cell surface. As can be seen from the summary of half-lives (Fig. 3E), the kinetics of fluorescence recovery were virtually identical for all transporters. We ruled out that fluorescence recovery was due to photo recovery by bleaching transporters (wild-type and mutant) trapped in intracellular vesicles. Fluorescence emission from intracellular transporters did not recover to any appreciable extent over the time course of the experiments (Fig. 3F). Incidentally, these control experiments also showed that the transporters seen at the cell surface must be in the cell membrane rather than in submembranous vesicles because transporters in vesicles could not support fluorescence recovery within the observation period. There is the caveat that the transporters that initially resided in vesicles may have been reinserted into the membrane and that their fluorescence had recovered but was no longer visible in a vesicular form but was present as surface fluorescence. Although we cannot formally rule out this possibility, it appears unlikely: control experiments were also done with transporters with mutated C termini. These were trapped within the cell and never reached the plasma membrane (10Farhan H. Korkhov V.M. Paulitschke V. Dorostkar M.M. Scholze P. Kudalcek O. Freissmuth M. Sitte H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28553-28563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Fluorescence emitted by these transporters also failed to recover within the observation period. Binding of β-[3H]CIT as a Conformational Probe—Given that wild-type and mutant SERTs co-localized with trypan blue and had comparable lateral mobility, we surmised that all transporters were present at the cell surface. Hence, we hypothesized that SERT-E136A, SERT-E136Q, and possibly SERT-E136D were trapped in a conformation that was not conducive to transport of substrate. The substrate translocation process is described by the alternate access model, which assumes a minimum of two distinct conformations of the transporter, i.e. an outward and an inward facing conformation. Inhibitors bind to the outward facing conformation, and their binding is contingent on the presence of Na+(19Talvenheimo J. Nelson P.J. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4631-4635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Talvenheimo J. Fishkes H. Nelson P.J. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6115-6119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using membrane preparations from cells expressing wild-type SERT, we therefore tested whether binding of the radioligand inhibitor β-[3H]CIT is useful as a probe for the conformational cycle of the transporter. The apparent association rate of β-[3H]CIT binding was too slow to be measured reliably in the total absence of Na+ (ionic strength being preserved by choline chloride) (see Fig. 6B). In the presence of a low concentration of Na+ (5 mm, i.e. within the range of the [Na+]i), binding of β-[3H]CIT was slow (kapp = 0.08 ± 0.01 min-1, n = 3) (Fig. 4A, ▴). When the concentration of Na+ was raised to 120 mm (i.e. within the extracellular range), the apparent association rate was dramatically accelerated, and equilibrium was reached within 5 min (kapp = 0.36 ± 0.06 min-1, means ± S.E., n = 3) (Fig. 4A, ▪). Binding was also accelerated by K+ (kapp = 0.17 ± 0.01 min-1, n = 3) (Fig. 4A,▾), but the observed kapp was substantially lower than that achieved in the presence of equimolar Na+, although the concentrations of Na+ and K+ were lower than and exceeded normal intracellular [Na+]i and [K]i, respectively. Thus, both ions promoted the accumulation of the conformation that supported binding of the radioligand inhibitor, but Na+ was substantially more effective.FIGURE 4Binding ofβ-[3H]CIT to wild-type SERT. A, kinetics of β-[3H]CIT association with wild-type SERT (10 μg of protein/assay; 10 nm β-[3H]CIT) in buffer containing 120 mm NaCl (▪), 5 mm NaCl and 120 mm choline HCl (▴), and a combination of 5 mm NaCl and 120 mm KCl (▾). Experiments were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” B, dissociation ofβ-[3H]CIT from SERT following 100-fold dilution of the reaction in buffer containing 120 mm NaCl (▪) or choline HCl (•). Membranes (10 μg/reaction) were preincubated with 10 nm β-[3H]CIT and buffer containing 120 mm NaCl for 1 h; subsequently (t = 0), the reaction was diluted with 1 ml of buffer containing either 120 mm NaCl or choline HCl, and dissociation was allowed to proceed for the indicated times. C, sodium-promoted equilibrium binding of β-[3H]CIT. Membranes (10 μg) were incubated in the presence of 0.8 (▾) and 16 (▪)nm β-[3H]CIT for 1 h in buffer containing the indicated concentrations of Na+. Inset, binding observed at 0.8 (▿), 1.6 (▵), and 16 (□) nm was normalized by setting the respective maximum binding to 100% to highlight the fact that the EC50 of Na+ is independent of the β-[3H]CIT concentration. Data are from a single experiment carried out in parallel; two additional experiments gave similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Na+ and K+ also differed in their effects on the dissociation kinetics of β-[3H]CIT binding. If β-[3H]CIT was allowed to bind to wild-type SERT in the presence of 120 mm Na+ and if the reaction mixture was subsequently diluted 100-fold in sodium-free (choline-containing) solution, the complex dissociated with a half-life in the range of ∼6-10 min (Fig. 4B, •; and Table 1). If the reaction mixture was diluted in a solution containing Na+, the lifetime of the complex was prolonged by a factor of ∼2.5 (Fig. 4B, ▪; and Table 1). In contrast, dilution in K+-containing solution did not affect the dissociation rate of β-[3H]CIT to an appreciable extent (Table 1; see also Fig. 8A).TABLE 1Dissociation rate constant (koff) for β-[3H]CIT binding to wild-type SERT and SERT mutated at Glu136 The reaction was carried out as described in the legends to Figs. 2B, 5, and 6. Data are means ± S.E. from three to five independent experiments performed in duplicate.koffCholineNa+K+min–1Wild-type SERT0.07 ± 0.010.03 ± 0.010.10 ± 0.02SERT-E136A0.27 ± 0.040.10 ± 0.010.13 ± 0.01SERT-E136D0.24 ± 0.030.10 ± 0.010.21 ± 0.03SERT-E136Q0.33 ± 0.040.11 ± 0.010.22 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab It is evident that Na+ had a more pronounced effect on the association rate compared with the dissociation rate of β-[3H]CIT binding. Sodium and the inhibitor may bind in a sequential order: in this model, Na+ binds independently of the inhibitor and induces or stabilizes a conformation that is prone to interact with β-[3H]CIT. Alternatively, the radioligand and Na+ may bind concomitantly and stabilize their binding to SERT in a reciprocal manner. The latter model predicts that the concentration-response curve of sodium depends on the radioligand concentration. This was not the case; as shown in Fig. 4C, the half-maximum concentration of Na+ required to promote binding of β-[3H]CIT was comparable at a low concentration (<KD) and at a quasi-saturating concentration of the radioligand. Thus, Na+ binding was independent of inhibitor binding, whereas inhibitor binding was dependent on Na+ binding. This is consistent with the interpretation that sequential binding is the favored reaction: Na+ binding occurs first and promotes the conformational switch that allows for binding of β-[3H]CIT. Binding of β-[3H]CIT to SERT Mutated at Position 136—When β-[3H]CIT binding was assessed under conditions that afforded equilibrium binding in wild-type SERT, it was evident that only the SERT-E136D mutant bound the radioligand with an affinity comparable with that of wild-type SERT (KD = 1.36 ± 0.31 and 3.24 ± 1.05 nm for wild-type SERT and SERT-E136D, respectively; means ± S.E., n = 3) (Fig. 5A, ▪ and ▾, respectively). In contrast, binding to SERT-E136Q (Fig. 5A, ♦) and SERT-E136A (Fig. 5A, ▴) was of low affinity; hence, a reliable calculation of the dissociation constant was not possible. The loss of affinity was not confined to the binding of the inhibitor β-[3H]CIT; the natural substrate serotonin also bound with an affinity that was reduced by >1 and 2 orders of magnitude to SERT-E136Q and SERT-E136A, respectively, compared with wild-type SERT and SERT-E136D (Fig. 5B). Because KD values could not be reliably calculated for SERT-E136Q and SERT-E136A, IC50 values (summarized in the legend to Fig. 5) were not converted to Ki values. However, it is obvious that the concentration of β-[3H]CIT employed in the competition assay was far below its KD for SERT-E136Q and SERT-E136A; thus, the difference in IC50 reflects a reduced affinity of these mutant transporters for their substrate. Previous experiments raised the possibility that, in GAT1, the homologous glutamate (Glu101) might function as the counterion for Na+ (21Keshet G.I. Bendahan A. Su H. Mager S"
https://openalex.org/W2070103798,"Numerous studies have suggested an important role of adenine at position –11 of the nontemplate strand of bacterial promoters for sequence-specific recognition of the –10 promoter element in single-stranded form. In this work, we attempted to identify a specific step in transcription initiation reaction that is most critically dependent on specific recognition of –11A. Mutating –11A in the context of a model promoter resulted in a profound decrease of the rate of heparin-resistant promoter complex formation and in a modest increase of the rate of heparin-resistant complex dissociation. The identity of nontemplate base at position –11 became relatively unimportant when the duplex in the vicinity of this position was destabilized by base pair mismatches. For promoters with a nonnative thymine at nontemplate position –11, we observed a remarkable correlation between the rate of heparin-resistant complex formation (or transcription activity) and the free energy of duplex stability in the vicinity of this residue, indicating that the replacement of –11A with a T affected a step in the reaction that involves local melting of DNA duplex. These data show that a promoter melting defect caused by a loss of RNA polymerase contact with –11A can be rescued by artificially induced local destabilization of the DNA duplex. These results are consistent with and support the idea that specific recognition of adenine at the nontemplate –11-position is important only for the initial nucleation of melting, which probably involves the flipping of this adenine out from the DNA duplex.

The transcription initiation reaction includes a critical step of promoter melting that is needed to expose the DNA template strand for template-directed RNA synthesis. Transcription initiation in the case of bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) 2The abbreviations used are: RNAP, DNA-directed RNA polymerase holoenzyme; WT, wild type; nt, nucleotide(s). is a multistep reaction involving at least two major steps, a closed and an open complex (1deHaseth P.L.

In the closed complex, the enzyme makes sequence-specific contacts with at least one of the two conserved DNA hexamers that define bacterial promoter (the –10 and –35 elements). DNA template remains double-stranded in the closed complex. Subsequent isomerization to the open complex involves further conformational changes in the polymerase-promoter complex and includes a crucial DNA melting reaction. It has been suggested that this transition from closed to open complex involves two steps: a conformational transition in RNAP-promoter complex and a subsequent melting of promoter DNA (1deHaseth P.L.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5959-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). There is evidence that, at least for some promoters and at physiological temperatures, promoter melting is very rapid and that the step involving conformational transition in RNAP-promoter complex is rate-limiting for open complex formation (4Roe J-H.

However, significant evidence exists that suggests that some localized melting does occur during the rate-limiting step involving conformational change in RNAP. For example, extensive study of the effects of base depurination and DNA prenicking in the vicinity of the –10 region on open complex formation showed that facilitation of DNA melting contributed to the rate of open complex formation (8Li X-Y. McClure W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23558-23566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Such observations are consistent with an idea that promoter melting leading to formation of the open complex is a stepwise process that can be divided into at least two steps: nucleation of melting involving a very small subset of promoter region, which eventually becomes single-stranded in the open complex, and subsequent expansion of the melted region (3Helmann J.D. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5959-5967Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Stepwise melting has been detected in footprinting experiments (9Chen Y-F. Helmann J.D. J. Mol.

Bacterial RNAP can melt promoter in the absence of any accessory factors and without the input of energy from external sources. This indicates that the enzyme melts promoter DNA utilizing the energy from favorable noncovalent protein-DNA interactions in the RNAP-promoter complex. There are numerous contacts between various subunits of RNAP and promoter DNA (1deHaseth P.L. Zupancic M.L. Record Jr., M.T. J.

Base-specific recognition of the nontemplate strand of the –10 region of the promoter was first suggested by the unexpected requirement of the σ subunit for promoter-proximal pausing at the phage λ late gene promoter. DNA sequences required for this pausing exhibited striking similarity to nontemplate strand –10 sequence (14Ring B.Z. Yarnell W.S. Roberts J.W. Cell. 1996; 86: 485-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Subsequent binding studies utilizing single-stranded oligonucleotides or fork junction partial duplexes containing nontemplate strand single-stranded extensions confirmed that σ subunit in the holoenzyme recognizes the –10 nontemplate strand sequence with high selectivity and high affinity (15Marr M.T. Roberts J.W. Science. 1997; 276: 1258-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 16Huang X. Lopez de Saro F.J. Helmann J.D.

The potential importance of σ-nontemplate –10 DNA interactions in promoter melting is highlighted by the recent findings that the core of promoter melting activity of RNAP is localized to a very small subset of all promoter-polymerase contacts, limited essentially to σ –10 nontemplate strand contacts (19Young B.A. Gruber T.M. Gross C.A. Science. 2004; 303: 1382-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Niedziela-Majka A. Heyduk T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38219-38227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The above conclusion is based on data showing that a small fragment of RNAP (containing polymerase elements responsible for –10 nontemplate strand recognition) could efficiently melt promoter DNA (19Young B.A. Gruber T.M. Gross C.A. Science. 2004; 303: 1382-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RNAP was found to melt very short promoter fragments containing only the –10 consensus promoter element (20Niedziela-Majka A. Heyduk T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38219-38227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Adenine at position –11 in the nontemplate strand appears to be of special importance for promoter melting reaction. It is one of the most conserved residues in the –10 region of bacterial promoters (21Lisser S. Margalit H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). It is also critically important for sequence-specific recognition of the nontemplate strand –10 region by the σ subunit in the holoenzyme, since mutations at this position strongly decrease the binding affinity (16Huang X. Lopez de Saro F.J. Helmann J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2603-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17Guo Y. Gralla J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 22Matlock D.L. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12274-12283Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Fine dissection of determinants responsible for the preference for –11 adenine identified the N1 position of the base as critical for high affinity binding (22Matlock D.L. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12274-12283Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Position C2 was also suggested as important for –11A function (23Lee H.J. Lim H.M. Adhya S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16899-16902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, available data suggest that the C2 position is not essential and that the effects of substitutions at C2 are likely to be indirect due to close proximity of the C2 and N1 positions (22Matlock D.L. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12274-12283Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the DNA duplex, the N1 position of adenine is normally involved in hydrogen bonding with its complementary T residue. The interaction of RNAP with the N1 of –11 adenine and the A-T base pairing at –11 are thus mutually exclusive, indicating that the –11A interaction with RNAP could either catalyze disruption of the –11A-T base pair or could stabilize extrahelical conformation of spontaneously flipped-out –11A. Dynamic fluorescence polarization studies indicated tight association of the –11A with the polymerase in model RNAP·DNA complexes containing –11A in single-stranded conformation, supporting the notion of a specific contact between –11A and RNAP (24Tsujikawa L. Strainic M.G. Watrob H. Barkley M.D. deHaseth P.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15334-15341Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Protein-catalyzed or protein-stabilized DNA duplex states with a single base flipped out of the DNA duplex are well documented in the case of DNA repair enzymes (25Stivers J.T. Jiang Y.L. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2729-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). All of the above characteristics of the nontemplate –11A together with its locations exactly at the upstream boundary of the transcription bubble (where promoter melting is presumably nucleated) suggest a possibility that –11A could play a specific role in facilitating nucleation of promoter DNA melting through a flipped-out intermediate involving this residue. We describe here results of experiments indicating that indeed –11A interactions with the polymerase are involved in promoter melting nucleation. Materials—Sybr Green was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). All of the other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. Core RNAP enzyme was purified from Escherichia coli K12 cells (obtained from the fermentation facility at the University of Alabama) using the method of Burgess and Jendrisak (26Burgess R.R. Jendrisak J.J. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4634-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar) as modified by Polyakov et al. (27Polyakov A. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Cell. 1995; 83: 365-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and Hager et al. (28Hager D.A. Jin D.J. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7890-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Recombinant WT σ70 was expressed and purified as described previously (29Callaci S. Heyduk E. Heyduk T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32995-33001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Holoenzyme was reconstituted by incubating 2 μm core with 6 μm σ70 for 15 min at 37 °C. Oligonucleotides were obtained from commercial sources (IDT (Coralville, IA) or the Keck Oligonucleotide Synthesis Facility at Yale University (New Haven, CT)). Fluorescein (when present) was added to the 5′-end of the oligonucleotide during oligonucleotide synthesis. Oligonucleotides were purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Phosphoramidates used to incorporate diaminopurine, nebularine, and dSpacer were from Glen Research (Sterling, VA). Promoter DNA—The sequence of 160-bp promoter DNA (–110 to +50) used in this study was derived from λPR promoter sequence (supplemental data). It contained λPR sequence from –60 to +20 with –12G changed to T. Thus, both –10 and –35 hexamers were consensus. The rest of the sequence (–110 to –61 and +21 to +50) was unrelated random sequence DNA generated by a computer. Promoter DNA was assembled from two synthetic oligonucleotides: top strand 98-nt oligonucleotide (–110 to –13) and bottom strand 79-nt oligonucleotide (+50 to –29). The above oligonucleotides were mixed at 5 μm concentration in Klenow polymerase buffer and annealed (through the complementary 17-bp sequence at the 3′-ends of the oligonucleotides) by heating to 95 °C for 1 min and slowly (2 h) cooling down to room temperature. After annealing, dNTPs were added to 1 mm concentration, and Klenow fragment was added (5–8 units/μl) to fill in single-stranded regions of hybridized constructs. 160-bp promoter fragments containing mutations or mismatched base pairs were prepared as described above using top or bottom strand oligonucleotides with appropriate base substitutions. In the case of promoters with mismatched base pairs in the –10 region, 106 nt (–110 to –5) top oligonucleotides were used to prepare promoter fragments. The extended 25-bp complementary region in the case of this longer top oligonucleotide included the entire –10 region, allowing incorporation of mismatched base pairs into this region. Products of Klenow extension reactions were purified by ion exchange chromatography on a 1-ml Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was eluted with a 30-ml salt gradient (0.45-0.90 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 μm EDTA). The 160-bp promoter fragments were eluted from the column at ∼0.65 m NaCl. Pooled fractions were concentrated on Microcon Y-30 filter (Amicon). Concentration of promoter fragments was determined from absorbance at 260 nm. Some promoter templates for transcription assays were prepared by PCR amplification using promoters prepared as described above as a template. Kinetics of Heparin-resistant Complex Formation—Kinetics of heparin-resistant complex formation was determined using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (30Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed at 25 °C in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions were initiated by mixing 4 μl of 18.75 nm DNA template with 1 μl of 1 μm holoenzyme. Final concentrations were 15 nm and 200 nm for the template and the holoenzyme, respectively. At this high saturating concentration of the polymerase, the observed rates of heparin-resistant complex formation were independent of polymerase concentration and thus reflected the kinetics of the steps following the initial binding of the polymerase to the promoter. Reactions were terminated at the desired time points by adding 2 μl of heparin-Ficoll mix. Final concentration of heparin was 0.2 mg/ml. Immediately after the addition of heparin, 7-μl samples of the reaction mixture were loaded on a 7.5% native polyacrylamide gel running at constant 80 V in TBE buffer. Gels were stained with Sybr Green and were imaged on Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad). Total fluorescence of free DNA bands was determined using the scanner software and plotted as a function of time. Pseudo-first order apparent rate constants were obtained from nonlinear fitting of the data to a single-exponential decay model. In order to measure kinetics of open complex dissociation, open complexes were first preformed in a 150-μl sample containing 15 nm template and 150 nm holoenzyme. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, 3 μl of 10 mg/ml heparin were added (0.2 mg/ml final heparin concentration). At the desired time points, 5-μl samples were withdrawn and immediately loaded on a 7.5% native polyacrylamide gel running at constant 40 V in TBE buffer. The gels were stained and analyzed as described above. Permanganate Footprinting—5′-Ends of promoter templates were labeled with 32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase for 30 min at 37 °C (5–10 pmol of 5′ termini in 30 μl of reaction mixture containing 70 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), and 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). 32P-Labeled DNA fragments were purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). This labeling procedure produced DNA duplexes with both strands labeled at the 5′-end. Since the promoter sequence was positioned asymmetrically within promoter DNA fragments used, the footprints from both strands did not overlap each other when analyzed on polyacrylamide gel. Alternatively, DNA fragments with 32P label on one strand only were prepared by digesting promoter fragments with BglII or BamHI (for the lower strand labeling) and HindIII (for upper strand labeling). Following restriction enzyme digestion, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP (0.2 mm final concentration) and 13 pmol of [α-32P]dATP (in the case of BglII and BamHI digest) or dATP, dGTP, and dTTP (0.2 mm final concentration) and 13 pmol of [α-32P]dCTP (in the case of HindIII digest) and 5 units of Klenow fragment were added. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Radioactive labeled DNA fragments were purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Oxidative modification with KMnO4 was performed with 5 nm labeled template, 100 nm holoenzyme in 10 μl of transcription buffer. RNAP and template DNA were first mixed, and the open complex was allowed to form. The reaction was initiated by adding KMnO4 to a final concentration of 2 mm, and the mixture was incubated for 15 s at 37 °C. The reaction was quenched by adding 10 μl of 1% β-mercaptoethanol and 6 μg of calf thymus DNA in 50 μl of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). Reaction mixture was extracted with phenol, followed by chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. DNA pellets were dissolved in 100 μl of freshly prepared 1 m piperidine, and the samples were boiled for 10 min. Piperidine was extracted by chloroform, and DNA was precipitated by ethanol. Pellets were washed with 70% ethanol, 96% ethanol and were dried and dissolved in 7–10 μl of formamide colored with bromphenol blue. Samples were loaded on 8% sequencing gel. After the run, the gels were fixed in 5% acetic acid, dried on the gel dryer, and exposed with a phosphorus screen overnight. The images were scanned using PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and were analyzed quantitatively using ImageQuantMac version 1.2. KMnO4 footprints of naked DNA templates were performed in an analogous manner except that the reaction was initiated by adding KMnO4 to a final concentration of 2.5 mm followed by incubation for 3 min at 37 °C. Transcription Assays—Transcription assays were performed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 30 min. Holoenzyme for transcription assays was reconstituted by mixing 2 μm core enzyme and 5 μm σ70. Reconstituted holoenzyme was added to 10 μl of 10 nm template to a final concentration of 54 nm. Open complex was allowed to form for 10 min at 37 °C. Transcription was initiated by adding 2 μl of NTP mix (1.2 μl of 50 μm NTP, 0.56 μl of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml), 0.12 μl of 20 mm ATP, 0.12 μl of 10 mg/ml heparin). Reaction mixture was incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μl of formamide-containing stop buffer. Transcription products were resolved by 20% denaturing urea PAGE. Bands of radioactive RNA products were visualized using PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and were quantified using the program ImageQuantMac version 1.2. Stability of DNA Duplexes Containing Mismatched Bases—The relative stability of DNA duplexes containing various mismatched base pairs was determined using a simple partitioning assay (Fig. 5). 19-nt oligonucleotide (50 nm) corresponding to the fragment of promoter nontemplate strand around the –10 region (containing T at the –11-position), labeled at the 5′-end with fluorescein, was mixed with a 39-nt oligonucleotide (100 nm) corresponding to the template strand sequence (containing A at the –11-position) and 79-nt oligonucleotide (500 nm) corresponding to the template strand sequence (containing various mismatched bases at the –11-position). Relative amounts of fluorescein-labeled 19-nt oligonucleotides hybridized to 39 and 79 oligonucleotides were measured by running the samples on a native polyacrylamide gel and scanning the gel using MolecularImager FX. The ratio of these two duplexes was used to calculate relative stability of the two duplexes according to a procedure analogous to that described in Ref. 22Matlock D.L. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12274-12283Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar. Relative stability was calculated as a free energy difference between stability of 19-nt/39-nt duplex (containing a T-A base pair at position –11) and stability of 19-nt/79-nt duplex (containing the corresponding base pair mismatch at position –11). Stability measurements were made in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Essentially the same results were obtained if the samples were mixed at 25 °C or were first heated up to 95 °C followed by slow cooling to 25 °C. Effects of Mutations in the –10 Region of the Promoter on the Kinetics of Promoter Melting and on the Binding Affinity of –10 Single-stranded Nontemplate Strand DNA Exhibit a Similar Pattern—In our previous studies, we have determined the energetic consequences of mutating each of the –10 promoter region consensus bases on the binding affinity of a model fork junction DNA construct containing –10 nontemplate strand in single-stranded form (22Matlock D.L. Heyduk T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12274-12283Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These studies showed that mutations at positions –11 and –7 produced the largest decrease in the binding affinity. In the present work, we assessed the role of sequence-specific interactions between RNAP and the nontemplate strand by determining if these interactions are involved in formation of kinetically significant intermediates in the promoter melting reaction. We prepared 13 mutant promoter constructs containing various single base pair substitutions in the –10 region. For each of these mutants, the kinetics of formation of heparin-resistant complex was examined. Resistance to the challenge with heparin is a hallmark of the formation of the first intermediate in the closed to open complex isomerization reaction (7Saecker R.M. Tsodikov O.V. McQuade K.L. Schlax Jr., P.E. Capp M.W. Record Jr., M.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 649-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 illustrates results of these experiments. The formation of heparin-resistant complex was extremely fast with promoter containing the consensus –10 and –35 elements (Fig. 1, A and B). The reaction was essentially complete within the time required to mix the reagents (∼15 s). In contrast, a promoter bearing an A to T substitution at position –11 exhibited much slower kinetics of heparin-resistant complex formation (Fig. 1, C and D). Although promoter melting was much slower in the case of this mutant, the final open complexes with the wild-type and mutant promoters had a similar structure, as judged by KMnO4 probing experiments (Fig. 2). The same set of template strand thymine residues (with the obvious exception of the template strand –11T, which is missing in the mutant promoter) became susceptible to KMnO4 oxidation in the presence of RNAP, indicating a qualitatively similar extent of promoter melting in the case of the wild-type and mutant promoter. Additionally, these probing experiments confirmed the slower kinetics of promoter melting in the case of the mutant promoter, since full footprint is established within 0.5 min in the case of the wild-type promoter, whereas only a very faint"

In the present study, we elucidated the involvement of maxi-K channel activation in the antiangiogenic effect of rosiglitazone, a well known PPARγ ligand in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. We found that the antiangiogenic effects of rosiglitazone were reversed by either bisphenol A diaglycidyl ether, a PPARγ antagonist, or iberiotoxin, a maxi-K channel blocker. Knockdown of maxi-K channel expression also reversed the antiangiogenic effects. Iberiotoxin reversed the rosiglitazone-induced hyperpolarization while having no effect on the endogenous PPARγ activation, suggesting that rosiglitazone activates maxi-K channel via PPARγ. In the rosiglitazone-induced antiangiogenic process, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase-Ser1179 phosphorylation and NO production were significantly elevated, and treatment with the NOS inhibitor NG-monomethyl-l-arginine acetate abolished the antiangiogenic and apoptotic effects of rosiglitazone, indicating NO as a key mediator of the rosiglitazone actions. In conclusion, rosiglitazone significantly inhibited VEGF165-induced angiogenesis by a proapoptotic mechanism via PPARγ-mediated NO production, followed by maxi-K channel opening.

Since the progression of tumor growth and metastasis appears to be dependent on angiogenesis, antiangiogenic drugs are clinically relevant for cancer therapy. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and bind to specific DNA sequences to induce transcriptional activation of specific genes (6Schoonjans K.

Cobb J.E. Cowan D.J. Wiethe R.W. Correa I.D. Prakash S.R. Beck K.D. Moore L.B. Kliewer S.A. Lehmann J.M. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Recent investigations suggested that PPARγ ligands have inhibitory effects on tumor cell lines, but the effects appear not to be entirely elicited by the direct action on tumor cells. Similarly, Panigrahy et al. (12Panigrahy D. Singer S. Shen L.Q. Butterfield C.E. Freedman D.A. Chen E.J. Moses M.A. Kilroy S. Duensing S. Fletcher C. Fletcher J.A. Hlatky L. Hahnfeldt P. Folkman J.

In addition, 15-deoxy-Δ-12,14-prostaglandin J2, an endogenous PPARγ ligand, inhibited VEGF-induced angiogenesis in the rat cornea (13Xin X. Yang S. Kowalski J. Gervitsen M.E. J. Biol.

However, the direct mechanism for the antiangiogenic effects of PPARγ activation in the endothelial cells remains currently unclear. The endothelium plays a pivotal role in a variety of vascular functions such as blood pressure control, vascular remodeling, and angiogenesis, where ion channels, particularly large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (also known as the BK channel or maxi-K channel), are the key mediators (17Ling S. Woronuk G. Sy L. Lev S. Braun A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30683-30689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Maxi-K channels are distributed in various tissues, such as human brain tumors, vascular smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells, and their activations were shown to inhibit migration of human glioma cells (18Kraft R. Krause P. Jung S. Basrai D. Liebmann L. Bolz J. Patt S. Pflugers Arch. 2003; 446: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The maxi-K channels are synergistically regulated by various intracellular second messengers, such as cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration, cGMP, hydrogen peroxide, and nitric oxide (NO) (19Bolotina V.M. Najibi S. Palacino J.J. Pagano P.J. Cohen R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar, 20Fukao M. Mason H.S. Britton F.C. Kenyon J.L. Horowitz B. Keef K.D. J. Biol.

Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 199-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). NO is produced by a group of enzymes called nitric-oxide synthases (NOS), and endothelial NOS (eNOS or NOS3) is responsible for the production of NO in vascular endothelial cells. Although the expression and activity of eNOS seems to be constitutive, the activity was shown to be regulated by serine phosphorylation (22Cho D.H. Choi Y.J. Jo S.A. Jo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2499-2506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the possible involvement of maxi-K channels in the antiangiogenic effects of rosiglitazone in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The inhibitory action of rosiglitazone on VEGF-stimulated angiogenesis was blocked either by iberiotoxin or by knockdown of maxi-K channel expression, and the effect was associated with apoptotic action as shown by DNA fragmentation and Bcl-2 and Bax regulation. The mediator involved in the maxi-K channel opening by rosiglitazone appears to be NO, produced by PPARγ-activated eNOS. These findings provide important understanding that maxi-K channel plays a critical role in the rosiglitazone-induced antiangiogenesis in HUVECs. Cell Cultures—HUVEC (ATCC CRL-1730; endothelial cell line derived from vein of human umbilical cord) were cultured in Kaighn's F12K medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mg/ml heparin sodium, 0.03-0.05 mg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement, and 1% antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Cells were grown to confluence at 37 °C in 5% CO2 on 0.1% gelatin-coated culture dishes and used for experiments at no greater than passage 8. Angiogenesis Assays—The tube formation assay was performed on 24-well plates coated with 250 μl of Matrigel Basement Membrane Matrix (10 mg/ml)/well and polymerized for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells treated with either bisphenol A diaglycidyl ether (BADGE) or iberiotoxin for 30 min at 37 °C were plated onto a layer of Matrigel at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well and followed by the addition of either rosiglitazone or NS-1619. Matrigel cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 18 h and photographed (×100). An in vivo Matrigel plug assay was carried out by injecting 0.5 ml of Matrigel containing VEGF165 (5 ng/ml) and heparin (40 units/ml) into C57BL/6J mice subcutaneously. After 5 days, mice were sacrificed, and Matrigel plug was recovered, fixed with 10% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and examined with hematoxylin/eosin stain after paraffin embedment. To quantify the formation of new blood vessels, the amount of hemoglobin was measured using the total hemoglobin kit. The concentration of hemoglobin was calculated from a known amount of hemoglobin assayed in parallel. Cell Proliferation Assay—HUVECs seeded at a density of 1 × 104 cells/well in 96-well plates were incubated for 3 h in Kaighn's F12K medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum and exposed to rosiglitazone or NS-1619 (0.1-10 μm) for 1 h followed by VEGF165 (10 ng/ml) stimulation for 4 days. After incubation, an MTT assay was carried out (23Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46262) Google Scholar), and the optical density was measured at 570-630 nm using a microplate spectrometer (Bio-Rad). Apoptosis Assays—Cells were treated with either rosiglitazone (10 μm) or NS-1619 (10 μm) for 3 h in the presence or absence of either BADGE (20 μm), iberiotoxin (0.3 μm), clotrimazole (10 μm), or glibenclamide (10 μm). Then cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml VEGF165 for 2 days. DNA fragmentation was detected by electrophoresis of DNA (15-20 μg/well) on 1.6% agarose gel, followed by visualization using ethidium bromide staining, and gel pictures were taken by UV transillumination. Apoptotic index was further quantified by acridine orange/ethidium bromide uptake, as previously reported (24Kalvelyte A. Imbrasaite A. Bukauskiene A. Verselis V.K. Bukauskas F.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cells treated as described above were stained by using acridine orange (final 25 μg/ml) and ethidium bromide (final 25 μg/ml) mixture for 10 min, and then cells were photographed (×100). Western Blotting Assay—Cells treated as described above were stimulated with 10 ng/ml VEGF165 for 1 h (eNOS) or 24 h (Bcl-2 and Bax) or 48 h (PPARγ). Following centrifugation of cell lysates at 12,000 rpm, 10 μg of total protein was loaded into an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Protein bands were visualized using chemiluminescence (Pierce) and quantified with UN-SCAN-IT gel 5.1 software (Silk Scientific, Inc., Orem, UT). Polyclonal antibodies against Bax, PPARγ, phospho-eNOS-Ser1179, phospho-eNOS-Thr497, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, actin, and monoclonal antibody against Bcl-2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Membrane Potential Measurement Using Voltage-sensitive Fluorescent Dye—Cells (1.5 × 104 cells/well) were incubated with 200 nm DiBAC in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 37 °C and exposed to BADGE (20 μm), iberiotoxin (0.3 μm), or NG-monomethyl-l-arginine acetate (l-NMMA, 10 μm) for 1 h and then stimulated by rosiglitazone or NS-1619 (10 μm) for 3 h, followed by VEGF165 (10 ng/ml) for 1 h. The fluorescence intensities of DiBAC molecules were recorded at 545 nm using a fluorescence plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc. Winooski, VT). Hyperpolarization resulted in the extrusion of the dye from cells, causing a subsequent decrease in fluorescence intensity. Maxi-K Channel Knockdown Using Stealth™ RNAi Oligonucleotide—The Stealth™ RNAi oligonucleotide was synthesized by Invitrogen with the following sequence complementary to human maxi-K mRNA (GenBank™ accession number nm 002547, beginning at the position 1726 target sequence site): sense, 5′-CCG AAG AUA AGA AUC AUC ACU CAA A; antisense, 5′-UUU GAG UGA UGA UUC UUA UCU UCG G. The Stealth™ RNAi negative control Duplex (Invitrogen) was used as a control oligonucleotide. Transfection efficiency was monitored using a fluorescent oligonucleotide (BLOCK-iT fluorescent oligonucleotide; Invitrogen) and estimated to be 80-90%. The Stealth™ RNAi molecules were transfected into HUVECs using Lipofectamine and Plus reagent following Invitrogen's protocols. The final concentration of 100 nm Stealth™ RNAi oligonucleotide was empirically determined to maximally suppress target RNA expression, and the Stealth™ RNAi oligonucleotide was transfected to the medium 48 h prior to the treatment of rosiglitazone. The ability of the Stealth™ RNAi oligonucleotide to knock down maxi-K channel expression was analyzed by Western blot and real time PCR on whole cell extracts. Measurement of Cytosolic Ca2+ and NO Concentrations—Cells transfected with either control RNAi or Maxi-K channel Stealth™ RNAi were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well in 12-well tissue culture plates and incubated with Kaighn's F12K medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum plus BADGE or iberiotoxin for 1 h and then exposed to rosiglitazone or NS-1619 for 3 h. Thereafter, VEGF165 was added and incubated for 3 h. Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration was determined by measuring the fluorescence of fluo-3 AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) at 545 nm using a fluorescence plate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments). NO production by HUVECs was measured as nitrite (a stable metabolite of NO) concentrations in cell culture supernatants using Griess reagent system following Promega's protocols. Drugs—Recombinant human VEGF165 was purchased from R&D Systems. Rosiglitazone was synthesized in the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (Daejeon, Korea). NS-1619, iberiotoxin, BADGE, clotrimazole, endothelial cell growth supplement, heparin, acridine orange, ethidium bromide, and MTT were from Sigma. The Hemo-s reagent kit was from YD Diagnostics (Seoul, Korea). l-NMMA and glibenclamide were from Tocris. Matrigel was from BD Biosciences. Rosiglitazone, NS-1619, BADGE, iberiotoxin, clotrimazole, glibenclamide, and l-NMMA were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide as a 20 mm stock solution and then diluted with phosphate-buffered saline. Statistics—The results are expressed as means ± S.E. Student's t test was used for analyzing values between vehicle groups and compound-treated groups. p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Effects of Maxi-K Channel Modulators and Rosiglitazone on VEGF-induced Angiogenesis—Matrigel-plated HUVECs elongated and migrated in the presence of VEGF, forming a tubular network, as evidenced by morphological changes. Both rosiglitazone and NS-1619, a maxi-K channel opener, markedly suppressed the formation of tube-like structures at 10μm (Fig. 1). The suppression of tube formation by rosiglitazone (10 μm) was reversed by either BADGE (20 μm), a PPARγ antagonist, or iberiotoxin (0.3 μm), a maxi-K channel blocker. The concentrations of BADGE and iberiotoxin were selected as 20 and 0.3μm, respectively, which showed maximum effect without cytotoxicity. Five days after implantation of Matrigel containing VEGF165 (5 ng/ml) in mice, histological examination and measurement of hemoglobin content of Matrigel were carried out. The microvessel formation and hemoglobin content were significantly increased in the Matrigel containing VEGF165 (5 ng/ml) (Fig. 2, B and F). Rosiglitazone (10 μm) significantly reduced the formation of VEGF165-stimulated neomicrovessels and hemoglobin contents (57% inhibition; VEGF165 only, 6.12 ± 0.60 g/dl; rosiglitazone + VEGF165, 2.44 ± 0.47 g/dl), which was completely antagonized by either BADGE or iberiotoxin (Fig. 2F). These results suggest that rosiglitazone elicited a strong in vivo antiangiogenic activity via PPARγ-dependent maxi-K channel opening. Effects of Maxi-K Channel Modulators and Rosiglitazone on the VEGF-induced Cell Proliferation—When HUVECs were incubated in the medium containing 10 ng/ml VEGF165 for 4 days, cell proliferation was increased to about 2-fold. Rosiglitazone (0.1-10 μm) suppressed the cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner with about 70% inhibition at 10 μm (Fig. 3). The effect of rosiglitazone was partially reversed by BADGE (20 μm) and iberiotoxin (0.3 μm), suggesting that the antiproliferative effects of rosiglitazone may be, at least in part, mediated by PPARγ activation and by maxi-K channel opening (Fig. 3). The extent of the observed inhibitory effects of rosiglitazone was similar to that described in previous reports (13Xin X. Yang S. Kowalski J. Gervitsen M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 13: 9116-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 25Murata T. Hata Y. Ishibashi T. Kim S. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. Hinton D.R. Arch. Ophthalmol. 2001; 119: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In parallel, NS-1619 (0.1-10 μm) significantly suppressed the cell proliferation induced by VEGF165 (10 ng/ml) in a concentration-dependent manner, which was reversed by iberiotoxin but was not reversed by BADGE. Apoptotic Effects of Rosiglitazone on HUVECs—To examine whether antiangiogenic and antiproliferative activities of rosiglitazone are related with apoptosis, we measured the effects of rosiglitazone on DNA fragmentation. Rosiglitazone (10 μm) induced prominent oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, indicating the apoptotic action of rosiglitazone (Fig. 4A). Apoptotic cell death induced by rosiglitazone was further confirmed by acridine orange and ethidium bromide staining. As shown in Fig. 4C, control and VEGF165-treated cells had a uniform green color in nuclei, but rosiglitazone-treated cells had bright orange areas of condensed chromatin in the nucleus. The rosiglitazone-induced apoptosis was inhibited by either BADGE (20 μm) or iberiotoxin (0.3 μm), suggesting that the apoptosis seems to be mediated by PPARγ-dependent maxi-K channel opening. NS-1619 (10 μm) significantly induced the DNA fragmentation and stained orange in the nucleus, which was reversed by iberiotoxin (0.3 μm) but not by BADGE (20 μm) (Fig. 4). Either BADGE or iberiotoxin alone had no effect on oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation. On the other hand, clotrimazole (10 μm), an intermediate conductor of Ca2+-activated K+ channel blocker, and glibenclamide (10 μm), an ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker, were not capable of inhibiting rosiglitazone-induced DNA fragmentation, suggesting the specific involvement of maxi-K channel in the rosiglitazone-induced apoptotic action (Fig. 4B). The DNA fragmentation by rosiglitazone was accompanied by suppression of Bcl-2 (antiapoptotic protein) expression and increased Bax (proapoptotic protein) expression (Fig. 5), further suggesting that the suppression of endothelial cell viability is associated with apoptotic effects. These effects were also reversed by BADGE (20 μm) and iberiotoxin (0.3 μm). Effects of Knockdown of Maxi-K Channel Expression on the Rosiglitazone-induced Antiangiogenic and Antiproliferative Actions—The transfection of Stealth™ RNAi oligonucleotide in HUVECs resulted in the reduction of maxi-K channel expression to 10% of control (Fig. 6A). In contrast to the antiangiogenic and antiproliferative effects of rosiglitazone in negative control Stealth™ RNAi-transfected HUVECs, rosiglitazone (10 μm) was ineffective on VEGF165-induced tube formation and cell proliferation in maxi-K channel-knocked down cells (Fig. 6, B and C). These results provide conclusive evidence that maxi-K channel activation is required for the antiangiogenic and antiproliferative effects of rosiglitazone on endothelial cells. Rosiglitazone-induced Maxi-K Channel Opening via PPARγ Activation—To directly demonstrate that rosiglitazone induces maxi-K channel opening, we examined the effect of rosiglitazone on the membrane potential of HUVECs using DiBAC fluorescence. Rosiglitazone caused endothelial hyperpolarization, which was reversed by either BADGE (20 μm) or iberiotoxin (0.3 μm) (Fig. 7A). These results provide the direct evidence that rosiglitazone activates maxi-K channel opening in HUVECs. NS-1619 also resulted in the endothelial hyperpolarization being reversed by iberiotoxin but not reversed by either BADGE or l-NMMA. To confirm that maxi-K channel activation is the downstream effect of rosiglitazone-induced PPARγ activation, the effect of iberiotoxin on the rosiglitazone-induced endogenous PPARγ activation was determined. Rosiglitazone increased endogenous PPARγ expression as expected, but this effect was not affected by iberiotoxin (Fig. 7B), indicating that activation of maxi-K channel is indeed the consequence of PPARγ activation by rosiglitazone. In addition, iberiotoxin had no effect on the endogenous PPARγ transcriptional activity stimulated by rosiglitazone when determined with a transcription reporter assay using PPAR-responsive element reporter genes (data not shown). Effect of Rosiglitazone on eNOS Phosphorylation and NO Release— To determine whether rosiglitazone opened the maxi-K channel via NO production, we examined the eNOS phosphorylation by rosiglitazone. The eNOS-Ser1179 phosphorylation was significantly and concentration dependently elevated by rosiglitazone (1 and 10 μm). Increased eNOS-Ser1179 expression was antagonized by 20 μm BADGE but not antagonized by 0.3 μm iberiotoxin (Fig. 8A). On the other hand, eNOS-Thr497 phosphorylation was little affected by rosiglitazone treatment. Concurrent with increased eNOS-Ser1179 phosphorylation, rosiglitazone increased NO production, as shown in Fig. 8B. Rosiglitazone (10 μm) increased NO production to about 900 nm, which approximates the required concentration to activate maxi-K channels (19Bolotina V.M. Najibi S. Palacino J.J. Pagano P.J. Cohen R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). Increased NO production by rosiglitazone was antagonized by either 20 μm BADGE or 10 μm l-NMMA (data not shown) but not antagonized by 0.3 μm iberiotoxin or by knockdown of maxi-K channel expression (Fig. 8B). In addition, l-NMMA pretreatment prevented rosiglitazone-induced hyperpolarization (Fig. 7A), suggesting that NO is an important player for PPARγ-mediated maxi-K channel activation. The DNA fragmentation and suppression of in vitro tube formation (Fig. 8, C and D) by rosiglitazone were antagonized by 10 μm l-NMMA, further indicating that NO is involved as a key mediator of rosiglitazone-induced apoptotic and antiangiogenic effects. l-NMMA itself had no effect on VEGF165-induced in vitro tube formation and DNA fragmentation. The concentration of 10 μm of l-NMMA was chosen, because 10 μm l-NMMA exhibited maximum effect without cytotoxicity. Effect of Rosiglitazone on Cytosolic Ca2+ Concentrations—We studied the effects of rosiglitazone and NS-1619 on the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration based on the previous observation that maxi-K channel activation resulted in the increase of intracellular Ca2+ concentration (26Kuhlmann C.R. Trumper J.R. Abdallah Y. Wiebke Ludders D. Schaefer C.A. Most A.K. Backenkohler U. Neumann T. Walther S. Piper H.M. Tillmanns H. Erdogan A. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 92: 1099-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Rosiglitazone elevated cytosolic Ca2+ concentration (45 ± 3% increase), which was antagonized either by 0.3 μm iberiotoxin or by 20 μm BADGE (Fig. 9). In parallel, NS-1619 treatment also increased intracellular Ca2+ concentration (results not shown). To determine whether increased Ca2+ is the upstream or downstream effect of maxi-K channel activation by rosiglitazone, we checked the effects of rosiglitazone on the cytosolic Ca2+ in the maxi-K channel RNAi-transfected cells. The increased Ca2+ by rosiglitazone was abolished in maxi-K channel RNAi-transfected cells, suggesting that increased Ca2+ may be the consequence of the maxi-K channel activation by rosiglitazone. PPARγ has been recognized as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of pathologic neovascularization (13Xin X. Yang S. Kowalski J. Gervitsen M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 13: 9116-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 25Murata T. Hata Y. Ishibashi T. Kim S. Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. Hinton D.R. Arch. Ophthalmol. 2001; 119: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), since various PPARγ ligands inhibited growth and/or migration of vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, monocytes, and certain tumor cells (27Hsueh W.A. Law R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 1891-1895Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 28Willson T.M. Lambert M.H. Kliewer S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 341-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates the novel finding that the antiangiogenic effect of rosiglitazone is mediated by PPARγ-induced maxi-K channel opening and subsequent apoptosis in HUVECs. Among many cell types involved in the PPARγ-mediated antiangiogenic action, recent investigations supported the importance of endothelial cells in the inhibitory activity of PPARγ ligands with the identification of functionally active PPARγ expression in the tumor endothelium and in the immortalized endothelial cells (9Bishop-Bailey D.

An endogenous ligand, 15-deoxy-Δ-12,14-prostaglandin J-2, and thiazolidinediones inhibited endothelial differentiation into tube-like structures and proliferation, and suppressed VEGF-induced angiogenesis (13Xin X.

Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Similarly, troglitazone and rosiglitazone inhibited VEGF-induced proliferation, migration, and tube formation of bovine choroidal endothelial cells (13Xin X. Yang S. Kowalski J. Gervitsen M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 13: 9116-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (477) Google Scholar), and rosiglitazone directly suppressed growth of a variety of primary tumors and metastatic invasion by antiangiogenic effect (12Panigrahy D. Singer S. Shen L.Q. Butterfield C.E. Freedman D.A. Chen E.J. Moses M.A. Kilroy S. Duensing S. Fletcher C. Fletcher J.A. Hlatky L. Hahnfeldt P. Folkman J. Kaipainen A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Our results confirmed the previous reports (13Xin X. Yang S. Kowalski J. Gervitsen M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 13: 9116-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (477) Google Scholar) that rosiglitazone, a PPARγ agonist, induced a strong concentration-dependent inhibition of neovascularization in response to VEGF165 in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with the reports showing PPARγ-mediated apoptosis in endothelial cells (9Bishop-Bailey D. Hla T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17042-17048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), we also observed that the antiproliferative effects of rosiglitazone were accompanied by DNA fragmentation with decreased Bcl-2 and increased Bax expression. In addition, the apoptotic cell death by rosiglitazone was further confirmed by acridine orange and ethidium bromide staining. Control and VEGF165-treated cells had a uniform green color in nuclei, but rosiglitazone-treated cells had bright orange areas of condensed chromatin in the nucleus. The effects of rosiglitazone were abolished by pretreatment with BADGE, a PPARγ antagonist, suggesting that rosiglitazone-induced anti-angiogenesis via apoptosis is predominantly mediated through PPARγ activation in HUVECs. Maxi-K channels, widely expressed channels in various cell types, regulate membrane action potential, neurotransmitter release, and cell death in neurons (30Poolos N.P. Johnston D. J.

Thus, we postulated that maxi-K channels might be involved in the inhibitory action of rosiglitazone in VEGF165-induced angiogenesis of HUVECs. As confirmed from previous reports (12Panigrahy D. Singer S. Shen L.Q. Butterfield C.E. Freedman D.A. Chen E.J. Moses M.A. Kilroy S. Duensing S. Fletcher C. Fletcher J.A. Hlatky L. Hahnfeldt P. Folkman J. Kaipainen A. J. Clin.

Physiol. 2002; 540: 73-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), maxi-K channels as well as PPARγ were expressed in HUVECs by Western blot in our experiments (data not shown). Several lines of our experiments supported the involvement of maxi-K channels in rosiglitazone-induced anti-angiogenesis in endothelial cells in a PPARγ-dependent manner. First, the antiangiogenic effect by rosiglitazone was reversed by either iberiotoxin, a maxi-K channel blocker, or BADGE, a PPARγ antagonist. Second, NS-1619, a specific maxi-K channel opener exhibited similar antiangiogenic effects, which was reversed by iberiotoxin but not by BADGE. Third and most importantly, knockdown of maxi-K channel expression by RNAi abolished the antiangiogenic effects of rosiglitazone. On the other hand, either clotrimazole, an intermediate conductor of Ca2+-activated K+ channel blocker, or glibenclamide, an ATP-sensitive K+ channel blocker, was ineffective on the action of rosiglitazone, strongly indicating that PPARγ activation induced specifically the maxi-K channel opening, at least in part, resulting in the proapoptotic and antiangiogenic effects in endothelial cells. The reversal of rosiglitazone action by maxi-K channel inhibition (i.e. iberiotoxin and RNAi) could be due to either the suppression of the rosiglitazone-induced activation of PPARγ or the downstream effects of PPARγ activation by rosiglitazone. In the present study, we observed that the effects of rosiglitazone on PPARγ activation were not interfered with by iberiotoxin. Furthermore, we demonstrated that rosiglitazone opened maxi-K channel, as determined by membrane hyperpolarization being reversed in the presence of either iberiotoxin or BADGE. All of these results suggest that rosiglitazone induced maxi-K channel opening via PPARγ activation, subsequently exhibiting antiangiogenic effects in endothelial cells. Maxi-K channels are regulated by various intracellular second messengers, including NO (19Bolotina V.M. Najibi S. Palacino J.J. Pagano P.J. Cohen R.A.

Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 199-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For example, NO appears to stimulate maxi-K channel activity either via indirect cGMP generation or via direct fashion (19Bolotina V.M. Najibi S. Palacino J.J. Pagano P.J. Cohen R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar, 20Fukao M. Mason H.S. Britton F.C. Kenyon J.L. Horowitz B. Keef K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10927-10935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), although the regulatory role of NO in the endothelial maxi-K channel is still controversial (21Brakemeier S. Eichler I. Knorr A. Fassheber T. Kohler R. Hoyer J. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 199-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 33Haburcak M. Wei L. Viana F. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Cell Calcium. 1997; 21: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recently, several studies reported that PPARγ activation increased endothelial NO production (22Cho D.H. Choi Y.J. Jo S.A. Jo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2499-2506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 34Calnek D.S. Mazzella L. Roser S. Roman J. Hart C.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 52-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), possibly via regulation of eNOS phosphorylation at serine 1179 and at threonine 497. In comparison, other studies suggested that eNOS phosphorylation is not involved in the maxi-K channel-mediated NO production (26Kuhlmann C.R. Trumper J.R. Abdallah Y. Wiebke Ludders D. Schaefer C.A. Most A.K. Backenkohler U. Neumann T. Walther S. Piper H.M. Tillmanns H. Erdogan A. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 92: 1099-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, we further elucidated the signaling pathway of rosiglitazone-induced maxi-K channel opening by examination of eNOS phosphorylation and NO production. The eNOS-Ser1179 phosphorylation was significantly and concentration-dependently elevated by rosiglitazone, resulting in the increased NO production, whereas eNOS-Thr497 phosphorylation was not altered. NO production by rosiglitazone was antagonized by BADGE but not antagonized by either iberiotoxin or knockdown of maxi-K channel expression. In addition, l-NMMA blocked rosiglitazone-induced hyperpolarization, implying that NO acts as a mediator of rosiglitazone for maxi-K channel opening. On the other hand, the ineffectiveness of l-NMMA on the NS-1619-induced hyperpolarization is consistent with the previous results (26Kuhlmann C.R. Trumper J.R. Abdallah Y. Wiebke Ludders D. Schaefer C.A. Most A.K. Backenkohler U. Neumann T. Walther S. Piper H.M. Tillmanns H. Erdogan A. Thromb. Haemost. 2004; 92: 1099-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and the previously found NO production downstream of the maxi-K channel opening indicates that NO may also play a role as a downstream mediator. A localized increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration was observed after maxi-K channel opening and then induced apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells (35Krick S. Platoshyn O. Sweeney M. Kim H. Yuan J.X. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C970-C979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Zhang X.F. Gopalakrishnan M. Shieh C.C. Neuroscience. 2003; 122: 1003-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous results (26Kuhlmann C.R. Trumper J.R. Abdallah Y. Wiebke Ludders D. Schaefer C.A. Most A.K. Backenkohler U. Neumann T. Walther S. Piper H.M. Tillmanns H. Erdogan A. Thromb.

Neuroscience. 2003; 122: 1003-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), the present study showed that NS-1619 and rosiglitazone increased cytosolic Ca2+, but this increase was not observed in maxi-K channel RNAi-treated cells, indicating that the increase of intracellular Ca2+ may be the downstream effect of rosiglitazone-induced maxi-K channel activation. Taken together, the present study shows that rosiglitazone significantly inhibited VEGF165-induced angiogenesis in endothelial cells by a proapoptotic mechanism via PPARγ-mediated NO production, followed by maxi-K channel opening. Contrary to the established idea that PPARγ ligand-mediated NO production is linked to the vascular protective effects (22Cho D.H. Choi Y.J. Jo S.A. Jo I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2499-2506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the present study suggests that NO produced by rosiglitazone acts as an important mediator of apoptotic cell death through the pathway involving maxi-K channel activation. We believe that these data represent the first evidence of maxi-K channel activity in the rosiglitazone-induced anti-angiogenesis in endothelial cells. Although in vivo antiangiogenic activity of rosiglitazone seems to be a coordinated phenomenon from the effects on many different cell types, the results of the present study would provide an important insight on the antiangiogenic mechanism of rosiglitazone in the endothelial cells. Furthermore, the novel compounds acting as maxi-K channel openers in endothelial cells would potentially provide a useful approach for antiangiogenic therapy."

Because hK2 activates several factors participating in proteolytic cascades that may mediate metastasis of prostate cancer, modulation of the activity of hK2 is a potential way of preventing tumor growth and metastasis. Furthermore, specific ligands for hK2 are potentially useful for targeting and imaging of prostate cancer and for assay development. We have used enzymatically active recombinant hK2 captured by a monoclonal antibody exposing the active site of the enzyme to screen phage display peptide libraries. Using libraries expressing 10 or 11 amino acids long linear peptides, we identified six different peptides binding to hK2. Three of these were shown to be specific and efficient inhibitors of the enzymatic activity of hK2 toward a peptide substrate. Furthermore, the peptides inhibited the activation of the proform of prostate-specific antigen by hK2. Amino acid substitution analyses revealed that motifs of six amino acids were required for the inhibitory activity.

Screening based on determination of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 3The abbreviations used are: PSA, prostate-specific antigen; hK2, human kallikrein 2; mAb, monoclonal antibody; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; IFMA, immunofluorometric assay; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; pNA, p-nitroanilide; TBTU, 2-(1H-benzotriazol-2-yl)-1,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate. can be used to detect early prostate cancer, which when localized to the prostate is potentially curable by radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy (1Chodak G.W. Thisted R.A. Gerber G.S. Johansson J.E. Adolfsson J. Jones G.W. Chisholm G.D. Moskovitz B. Livne P.M. Warner J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). However, 20-30% of the cancers detected by screening show extraprostatic spread and will eventually develop into advanced disease, which presently cannot be cured. More aggressive screening strategies are needed to catch these tumors at a curable stage (2Catalona W.J. Ramos C.G. Carvalhal G.F. Yan Y. Urology. 2000; 55: 791-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), but this will lead to increased over-diagnosis of slowly growing tumors, only part of which need to be cured. It is, therefore, important to identify new therapeutic agents that could slow down the growth of prostate cancer so that clinical disease would not develop during the lifetime of the patient. Advanced disease can be treated by endocrine therapy, but androgen resistance develops within 2-5 years for which there is no effective treatment (3Stenman U.H. Abrahamsson P.A. Aus G. Lilja H. Bangma C. Hamdy F.C. Boccon-Gibod L. Ekman P. Scand. J. Urol. Nephrol. Suppl. 2005; 216: 64-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, novel pharmaceuticals need to be developed for treating both localized and metastatic prostate cancer. The prostate produces several proteases that are secreted into seminal fluid. Two homologous serine proteases, PSA and hK2, have been shown to be highly prostate-specific (4Wang M.C. Valenzuela L.A. Murphy G.P. Chu T.M. Investig. Urol. 1979; 17: 159-163PubMed Google Scholar, 5Morris B.J. Clin. Exp. Pharmacol. Physiol. 1989; 16: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 6Chapdelaine P. Paradis G. Tremblay R.R. Dube J.Y. FEBS Lett. 1988; 236: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Even though PSA is a sensitive serum marker of prostate cancer, its expression is actually lower in malignant than in normal prostatic epithelium, and it is even lower in poorly differentiated tumors (7Stege R. Grande M. Carlstrom K. Tribukait B. Pousette A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 160-165PubMed Google Scholar, 8Lintula S. Stenman J. Bjartell A. Nordling S. Stenman U.H. Prostate. 2005; 63: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In contrast, the expression of hK2 is higher in aggressive tumors (9Darson M.F. Pacelli A. Roche P. Rittenhouse H.G. Wolfert R.L. Young C.Y. Klee G.G. Tindall D.J. Bostwick D.G. Urology. 1997; 49: 857-862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). hK2 has been shown to activate the proforms of PSA and urokinase type plasminogen activator (10Frenette G. Tremblay R. Lazure C. Dube J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 71: 897-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and to inactivate plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (11Mikolajczyk S. Millar L. Kumar A. Saedi M. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 81: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible role in a proteolytic cascade associated with prostate cancer. Thus, hK2 may promote tumor growth, and metastasis and inhibition of hK2 activity may, therefore, slow down tumor spread. Because hK2 is highly prostate-specific, inhibition of its activity is a potential way of preventing prostate cancer growth and metastasis without side effects outside the prostate. Peptides are a potential alternative to monoclonal antibodies for treatment of cancer (12Pasqualini R. Koivunen E. Ruoslahti E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 542-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) and for diagnostic applications (13Wu P. Zhu L. Stenman U.H. Leinonen J. Clin. Chem. 2004; 50: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Screening of random peptide libraries can be used to develop novel types of enzyme inhibitors, peptide substrates, and ligands binding to the active site of receptors (14Ruoslahti E. Rajotte D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 813-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Recently developed peptide ligands binding specifically to PSA show novel types of binding specificity by reacting only with enzymatically active forms of free PSA (15Wu P. Leinonen J. Koivunen E. Lankinen H. Stenman U.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6212-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Wu P. Stenman U.H. Pakkala M. Narvanen A. Leinonen J. Prostate. 2004; 58: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). By using these peptides a novel type of assay designated immunopeptidometric assay has been established (13Wu P. Zhu L. Stenman U.H. Leinonen J. Clin. Chem. 2004; 50: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, small peptides against prostate-specific proteinases are potentially useful ligands for the development of novel diagnostic assays, but perhaps more importantly, they may be used for targeting of prostatic tumors. Because of their small size, peptides are not immunogenic and show faster tissue penetration than antibodies. They are easy to synthesize chemically and can be derivatized in several ways for labeling with isotopes (17Liu S. Edwards D.S. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 2235-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) or toxins (18Denmeade S.R. Nagy A. Gao J. Lilja H. Schally A.V. Isaacs J.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2537-2540PubMed Google Scholar) or for modification of pharmacokinetics (19Morpurgo M. Monfardini C. Hofland L.J. Sergi M. Orsolini P. Dumont J.M. Veronese F.M. Bioconjugate Chem. 2002; 13: 1238-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Peptides modulating the enzymatic activity of proteases may inhibit the growth of cancer (15Wu P. Leinonen J.

Radioactively labeled peptides are potentially useful for radioimaging, and peptide conjugates with cytotoxic drugs or boron compounds may be used to kill tumor cells (21Boerman O.C. Oyen W.J. Corstens F.H. Semin. Nucl. Med. 2000; 30: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the present study we have identified novel hK2-binding peptides, of which some were efficient and specific inhibitors of hK2. The motifs required for inhibitory activity were characterized by amino acid substitution analysis, which also led to the identification of peptides with improved inhibitory capacity. Materials—The monoclonal anti-PSA antibody (mAb) 5E4 (22Leinonen J. Wu P. Stenman U.-H. Clin. Chem. 2002; 48: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and recombinant wild-type hK2 (23Lovgren J. Tian S. Lundwall A. Karp M. Lilja H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1050-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were produced as described. PSA was purified from human seminal plasma as described (24Zhang W.M. Leinonen J. Kalkkinen N. Dowell B. Stenman U.H. Clin. Chem. 1995; 41: 1567-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). ProPSA was isolated from LNCaP cell culture media (16Wu P. Stenman U.H. Pakkala M. Narvanen A. Leinonen J. Prostate. 2004; 58: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antiserum to M13 bacteriophage coat proteins (ab6188) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). The proteinases bovine trypsin and α-chymotrypsin were obtained from Athens Research and Technology (Athens, GA). Human plasmin, thrombin, and plasma kallikrein were from Sigma. Recombinant human trypsin types 1, 2, 3, and C were produced in-house. The chromogenic substrates S-2586, S-2222 S-2238, S-2403, and S-2302 for chymotrypsin and PSA, trypsin, thrombin, plasmin, and kallikrein, respectively, were from Chromogenix Instrumentation Laboratory (Milano, Italy). Phage Display Library Screening—The phage display libraries were constructed in fUSE-5-phage as previously described (25Koivunen E. Wang B. Dickinson C. Ruoslahti E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 346-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We screened libraries with the structures CX7C, CX8C, X9, X10, X11, CX3CX3CX3C, where C stands for cysteine, and X is any of the 20 randomly occurring natural amino acids. Screening was performed according to Koivunen et al. (26Koivunen E. Wang B. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). We screened each peptide library against hK2, which was captured by mAb 5E4 coated onto microtiter wells (15Wu P. Leinonen J. Koivunen E. Lankinen H. Stenman U.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6212-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). mAb 5E4 binds PSA and hK2 in an equimolar manner and reacts with an epitope, which is remote from the active site of these enzymes (22Leinonen J.

Twenty-four ng of hK2 was incubated in antibody-coated wells for 30 min at 37 °C in 100 μl of 0.05 m Tris buffer, pH 7.7, containing 0.154 m NaCl and 8 mm NaN3 (TBS) followed by washing with TBS to remove unbound hK2. An aliquot of each phage library containing 1010-1011 transducing units was added into the microtiter wells in 100 μl of TBS containing 10 g/liter bovine serum albumin (BSA). Incubation took place at 4 °C with gentle shaking for 16-24 h in the first round and for 1 h for the following three rounds. The wells were washed 10 times with TBS containing 0.5% Tween 20. To elute bound phages 100 μl of 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.2, containing 1 g/liter BSA was added. The eluted phage suspension was neutralized with 1 m Tris buffer, pH 9.0, amplified by infection of kanamycin-resistant Escherichia coli K91 cells and purified by polyethylene glycol precipitation (15Wu P. Leinonen J. Koivunen E. Lankinen H. Stenman U.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6212-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). After four rounds of selection and amplification, single-stranded DNA from individual phage clones was prepared. The sequences encoding peptides were determined after amplification by PCR (28Koivunen E. Ranta T.-M. Annila A. Taube S. Uppala A. Jokinen M. van Willigen G. Ihanus E. Gahmberg C.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 905-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The relevant part of the viral DNA was sequenced with an ABI 310 Genetic analyzer and the Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Core kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using as a primer 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGC AAG CTG ATA AAC CGA TAC AAT-3′. Immunofluorometric Assay (IFMA)—The phage IFMA was performed essentially as described (15Wu P. Leinonen J. Koivunen E. Lankinen H. Stenman U.-H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6212-6220Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The solid phase antibody (5E4) was coated onto microtitration wells at a concentration of 5 mg/liter in TBS for 16 h at 22 °C, the solution was discarded, and the wells were saturated with 10 g/liter BSA in TBS for 3 h at 22 °C. In the assay 50 ng of hK2 in 200 μl of assay buffer (TBS, pH 7.7, containing 2.3 g/liter bovine serum albumin and 0.15 g/liter bovine globulin) was captured onto wells coated with mAb 5E4. After washing, 2.5 μl of phage (108-109 infectious particles) and 200 μl of assay buffer were added to wells. After incubation for 1 h the wells were washed and filled with 200 μl assay buffer containing 100 ng of europium-labeled (29Hemmilä I. Dakubu S. Mukkala V.-M. Siitari H. Lüwgren T. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 335-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar) polyclonal anti-phage antibody recognizing the M13 coat protein of the phage. After incubation for 1 h the wells were washed 4 times, and enhancement solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added. The fluorescence was measured with a Victor 1420 fluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in time-resolved mode. Cross-inhibition Tests—The relative binding sites of the peptides on hK2 were mapped by competition experiments. The protocol was based on the IFMA method described above, except that various cloned phages and various synthetic peptides were reacted together with hK2. Briefly, each of the synthetic peptides at a concentration of 5 μm was added into wells in which hK2 had been captured by mAb 5E4. After incubation for 30 min, phage (1010-1011 units) was added, and after 1 h incubation the wells were washed, and bound phage were detected as described above for phage IFMA. Peptide Synthesis—Peptides hK2p01-hK2p06 (Table 1) were synthesized with an Apex 396 DC multiple peptide synthesizer (Advanced ChemTech, Kentucky) with Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy and TBTU/diisopropylethanolamine as coupling reagents. All peptides were synthesized on Gly-Wang resin (Advanced ChemTech). The side-chain protecting groups used in synthesis were t-butyloxycarbonyl for Trp and Lys, tert-butyl for Ser and Thr, 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofurane-5-sulfonyl for Arg, and trityl for Gln. For Cys both acetamidomethyl and trityl protection groups were used. The peptides were purified by HPLC (Shimadzu, Kioto, Japan) on a C18 reverse phase column with acetonitrile as eluent (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O, 0-60% acetonitrile gradient for 60 min). Alanine replacement experiments were done for peptides hK2p01-hK2p03 by changing each of the amino acids to alanine individually.TABLE 1Amino acid sequences and IC50 values of hK2-binding peptides Purified single-stranded DNA from phage display libraries X10 and X11 was sequenced after four successive rounds of panning.

Lyophilized peptides were dissolved in 50% acetic acid at a concentration of 2 g/liter. 1 m HCl (0.1 ml/mg of peptide) was added followed immediately by 0.1 m iodine solution in 50% acetic acid (molar excess of the iodine/acetamidomethyl group). The solution was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 40 min. The reaction was stopped with 0.1 m sodium thiosulfate. After filtering through a 0.45-μm disposable polypropylene filter (Puradisc, Whatman), the peptides were purified by HPLC as described above. The structure of each peptide was verified by mass spectrometry on a Biflex III matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (Bruker, Germany), and the purity was determined by analytical HPLC with a 240 × 1.4-mm C18 column eluted with 0-60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 30 min. Effect of the Peptides on the Enzymatic Activity of hK2—The effect of the peptides on the enzymatic activity of hK2 was studied by using the chromogenic substrate S-2302 (H-D-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA (H means open primary amine, and D means right-handed (steroisomer)). hK2 (0.17 μm) was incubated with a 100-1000-fold molar excess of synthetic peptide in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. After the addition of the substrate to a final concentration of 0.2 mm, the absorbance at 405 nm was monitored at 5-10-min intervals for 1 h with a Victor 1420 Multilabel fluorometer. Student's t test was used to evaluate the significance of the hK2 inhibition by the peptides. For this, 12 replicates were analyzed. The inhibitory capacity of the peptides was compared also by determining IC50 for hK2 inhibition, determined based on the velocity of S-2302 cleavage at 200 μm concentration by 0.17 μm hK2 in the presence of 0-400 μm peptide. In addition, the Ki value for the most potent inhibitory peptide was determined by a Lineweaver-Burk plot after determining the velocity of the cleavage of 0-400 μm S-2302 substrate by 0.2 μm hK2 in the presence of 4 μm of peptide. The specificity of the peptides was analyzed by studying their effect on the activity of other serine proteases including α-chymotrypsin, bovine trypsin, human trypsin 1, 2, 3, and C, urokinase, thrombin, plasmin, plasma kallikrein, and PSA. The assay was performed as described for hK2, but the substrate for PSA and α-chymotrypsin was S-2586 (MeO-Suc-Arg-Pro-Tyr-pNA), for urokinase it was S-2444 (pyroGlu-Gly-Arg-pNA), for thrombin it was S-2238 (H-D-Phe-pipecolic acid-Arg-pNA), for plasmin it was S-2403 (pyroGlu-Phe-Lys-pNA), for plasma kallikrein it was S-2302 (H-D-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA), and for the various trypsin isoenzymes it was S-2222 (CO-Ile-Glu-(OR)-Gly-Arg-pNA). Cleavage of the Peptides by Trypsin—Cleavage of the peptides by trypsin was studied by incubating 0.1 mm synthetic peptides with 3.9 nm bovine trypsin in 20 mm Tris-buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% BSA for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction mixture was applied on a Nova-Pak C18 column (3.9 × 75 mm, Waters, MA) that was connected to an ÄKTA purifier system (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 0-70% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 30 min. Effect of the Peptides on the Activation of proPSA by hK2—hK2 is known to activate proPSA (31Lovgren J. Rajakoski K. Karp M. Lundwall A. Lilja H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To determine whether the peptides are able to inhibit this activity, the hK2 binding peptides, hK2p01, hK2p02, and hK2p03, were incubated with hK2 for 50 min at room temperature in TBS buffer containing 1 g/liter BSA before the addition of proPSA. Concentrations of peptides, hK2, and proPSA were 0-100 μm, 7.5 nm, and 150 nm, respectively, in a final volume of 50 μl. After incubation for 2 h, 10 μl of 2.4 mm fluorogenic PSA substrate (4-morpholinecarbonyl-HSSKLQ-amidomethylcoumarin (JPT custom peptide (32Denmeade S.R. Lou W. Lovgren J. Malm J. Lilja H. Isaacs J.T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 4924-4930PubMed Google Scholar)) was added. Fluorescence (excitation at 355 nm and emission at 460 nm) was measured after 17.5 h of incubation in a Victor 1420. Similarity Searches—BLAST searches (www.ncbi.nih.gov/BLAST) (33Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) using the Swiss-Prot data base were performed to find if the hK2 binding sequences display sequence similarity with previously identified human peptides or proteins. Isolation and Structure of the Peptides—Screening with six different phage display peptide libraries revealed phages reacting with hK2 in libraries with the structures X10 and X11. Among 24 isolates from the X10 library, four different hK2-binding peptides were identified, designated hK2p01-hK2p04, of which the most prevalent one was hK2p02 (AARRPFPAPS) (Table 1). Three of the peptides were linear (hK2p01-hK2p03), whereas hK2p04 contained two Cys residues, suggesting that it forms a cyclic structure through a disulfide bridge. Among 10 isolates from the X11 library, we identified two peptide sequences (FRTCLRSWACM and CYRMPTCMQRD) containing two Cys residues, suggesting that they also are cyclic. Common motifs can be found among the peptides, i.e. peptides hK2p02 and hK2p03 both contain the motif ARRPFP and when the three cyclic peptides, hK2p04, hK2p05, and hK2p06, are aligned according to the location of the disulfide bridges, they all have an Arg residue as the third residue after the first Cys residue. Furthermore, in peptides hK2p05 and hK2p06, the second Cys residue is followed by a Met residue. The Arg residue, which is present in all peptides, is known to be located in the P1 position of hK2 substrates (34Cloutier S.M. Chagas J.R. Mach J.-P. Gygi C.M. Leisinger H.-J. Deperthes D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2747-5402Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Phage Binding with Synthetic Peptides—The relative binding specificity of the five peptides was studied by inhibition experiments using phage-displayed and synthetic peptides. Synthetic peptides hK2p01, -02, and -03, unlike hK2p04 and -06, inhibited the binding of the phage carrying the corresponding peptide as part of pIII protein showing that the peptides were active without the protein fusion part (Fig. 1). Phage hK2p05 showed weak binding in phage IFMA and was not further studied. In cross-inhibition experiments, synthetic peptides hK2p01-hK2p03 efficiently inhibited the binding of all five phages studied, indicating that they bind to the same region or close to each other on hK2 (Fig. 1). Effect of the Peptides on Enzymatic Activity of hK2—Peptides hK2p01, hK2p02, and hK2p03 caused a significant (p < 0.001) reduction in the enzymatic activity of hK2 (Fig. 2, Table 1), but their inhibitory activities were different (for all p < 0.001), with hK2p01 the most effective. When using 0.17 μm hK2, inhibition was observed with a 100-fold molar excess of peptides, and with a 1000-fold excess inhibition it was 70-80%. Peptides hK2p04 and hK2p06 did not affect the enzymatic activity of hK2 (data not shown). None of the peptides showed inhibition of the other serine proteinases studied. Fractionation of the reaction mixture containing trypsin and the hK2-binding peptides by C18 chromatography showed that the peptides were not degraded by bovine trypsin (data not shown). Effect of the Peptides on the Activation of ProPSA by hK2—Incubation of proPSA with hK2 increased PSA activity (Fig. 3), and this activation was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the peptides hK2p01, hK2p02, and hK2p03, indicating that they inhibit the activity of hK2 toward proPSA. IC50 values were 2.6 ± 0.1 μm for hK2p01, 6.5 ± 0.3 μm for hK2p02, and 18.6 ± 1.0 μm for hK2p03 (mean ± S.E., n = 8, p < 0.001 between all, Student's t test). proPSA or hK2 alone had no enzymatic activity toward the PSA-specific fluorogenic substrate. Amino Acid Substitution and Deletion Analyses—To define the motifs required for inhibitory activity of the peptides, amino acid substitution and deletion analyses were performed for peptides hK2p01-hK2p03. In the deletion analysis, each peptide was shortened one amino acid at a time either from the NH2 or COOH terminus (Table 2). In peptide hK2p01 (SRFKVWWAAG) Ala replacement of Arg-2, Phe-3, Lys-4, Val-5, Trp-6, and Trp-7 strongly reduced inhibition of hK2, suggesting that these residues are key mediators of the activity. Deletion of Ser-1 led to partial loss of activity, whereas replacement of it with Ala increased the inhibitory activity of the peptide, and IC50 decreased from 3.4 to 2.2 μm. This peptide showed the strongest inhibition with a Ki value of 1.41 μm. As determined by Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis, the peptide is a competitive inhibitor. Thus, some mutations in the NH2-terminal amino acid are tolerated, but it is important that a spacer amino acid is included before Arg-2. Deletion of the NH2-terminal SR motif abolished the activity, confirming the essential role of the second residue. Deletion analysis further showed that the AAG motif in the COOH terminus of hK2p01 is not required for inhibition. The RFKXWW motif is required for inhibition of hK2, and maximal inhibition is achieved with the ARFKVWWAAG peptide.TABLE 2Inhibition of hK2 activity by peptide derivatives based on alanine scanning and sequence trimming Molecular weights of the peptides and their hK2 inhibitory effect (% inhibition) at a peptide concentration of 170 μm are shown.SequencesMr% InhibitionhK2p01 derivativesSRFKVWWAAG1207.3579ARFKVWWAAG1191.3594SAFKVWWAAG1122.2427SRAKVWWAAG1131.250SRFAVWWAAG1150.260SRFKAWWAAG1179.3039SRFKVAWAAG1092.2210SRFKVWWAAG1092.2230SRFKVWWAAG1207.3578RFKVWWAAG1120.2722FKVWWAAG964.080WWAAG589.600SRFKVWWAG1136.2780SRFKVWWG1065.1979SRFKVWG878.988SRFKVG692.777SRFKG593.640hK2p02 derivativesGAARRPFPAPSG1183.3477GAAARPFPAPSG1098.230GAARAPFPAPSG1098.230GAARRAFPAPSG1157.300GAARRPAPAPSG1107.2475GAARRPFAAPSG1157.3024GAARRPFPAASG1157.3069GAARRPFPAPAG1167.3478RRPAP595.700RRPFP671.800RRPAG555.600RRPFG631.700GRRPAPG709.740GRRPFPG785.840AARRPAPG794.8836AAARRPAPG865.9651AARRPFPG870.9828AAARRPFPG942.0637hK2p03 derivativesGPARRPFPVTAG1225.4249GAARRPFPVTAG1199.3861GPAARPFPVTAG1140.310GPARAPFPVTAG1140.310GPARRAFPVTAG1199.380GPARRPAPVTAG1149.3249GPARRPFAVTAG1199.3817GPARRPFPATAG1197.3658GPARRPFPVAAG1195.3945GPARRPFPVTG1154.2848GPARRPFPVG1053.1737GPARRPFPG954.0433GPARRPFG856.920GPARRPG709.744GPARRG612.628GPARG456.430GPARRPFPVTAG1225.3658GARRPFPVTAG1128.2427GRRPFPVTAG1057.162GRPFPVTAG900.970GPFPVTAG744.780GFPVTAG647.660GPVTAG500.480GVTAG403.360 Open table in a new tab In peptides hK2p02 (AARRPFPAPS) and hK2p03 (PARRPFPVTA), substitution of Arg-3, Arg-4, Pro-5, and Pro-7 with Ala strongly reduced the inhibitory activity, whereas substitution of Pro-1 or Val-8 in hK2p03 slightly increased activity (Table 2). Deletion of Pro from the NH2 terminus of hK2p02 led to partial reduction in activity, whereas deletion of PA abolished activity. The APS and VTA motifs could be deleted from the COOH terminus of hK2p02 and hK2p03, respectively, without significant reduction of activity. Thus, the ARRPXP motif, which is present in both hK2p02 and hK2p03, is essential for hK2 inhibition. Sequence Similarity by BLAST Searches—In the Swiss-Prot data base 13 proteins containing the ARRPXP sequence, i.e. the sequence in peptides needed for hK2 inhibition, were found. These proteins included serine/threonine protein kinase p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) (GenBank™ accession code O96013), cytokine receptor-like factor 1 precursor (GenBank™ accession code O75462), and substance P part of protachykinin 1 precursor (GenBank™ accession code P20366). The rest of the proteins containing the motif were integral membrane proteins, cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins. There were no exact matches with the other hK2 inhibitory sequence RFKXWW. We isolated several peptides binding to hK2 using phage display peptide libraries. Most of the peptides specifically inhibited the enzymatic activity of hK2.

Hormones such as catecholamines and insulin regulate triacylglycerol metabolism through reversible serine phosphorylation of perilipin A. It was recently shown that perilipin was also located in triacylglycerol-synthesizing caveolae of the plasma membrane. We now report that perilipin at the plasma membrane of primary human adipocytes was phosphorylated on a cluster of threonine residues (299, 301, and 306) within an acidic domain that forms part of the lipid targeting domain. Perilipin B comprised <10% of total perilipin but was the major isoform associated with the plasma membrane of human adipocytes. This association was controlled by insulin and catecholamine: perilipin B was specifically depleted from the plasma membrane in response to the catecholamine isoproterenol, while insulin increased the amount of threonine phosphorylated perilipin at the plasma membrane. The reversible translocation of perilipin B to and from the plasma membrane in response to insulin and isoproterenol, respectively, suggests a specific function for perilipin B to protect newly synthesized triacylglycerol in the plasma membrane.

Adipose tissue is the major site in the body for storage of fatty acids as triacylglycerols. When energy is needed hormones, such as the catecholamine noradrenaline, stimulate hydrolysis of triacylglycerol (lipolysis) to mobilize the stored fatty acids, which are the primary source of energy for different tissues. The storage of triacylglycerol in adipocytes, on the other hand, is favored by insulin stimulation of lipogenesis and inhibition of lipolysis. Catecholamine stimulation of lipolysis is mediated by activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (1Honnor R.C. Dhillon G.S. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15122-15129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) increasing the phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (2Strålfors P. Belfrage P. J. Biol.

The lipolytic activity of hormone-sensitive lipase is additionally regulated by perilipin, which also becomes phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (5Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A.

In the absence of lipolytic stimulation perilipin inhibits lipolysis by acting as a barrier against hydrolysis of the triacylglycerol by lipases, but when phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase perilipin undergoes a conformational change that allows access of hormone-sensitive lipase to the surface of the lipid droplet and enhances the lipase activity (4Clifford G.M.

In adipocytes there are two forms of perilipin, perilipin A and perilipin B, expressed from differentially spliced mRNA. Perilipin A is present at a much higher concentration than perilipin B (9Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

While perilipin A affects both triacylglycerol lipases present in adipocytes, the effect of perilipin B is apparently restricted to hormone-sensitive lipase (10Zhang H.H. Souza S.C. Muliro K.V.

Otherwise no specific function has been attributed to perilipin B. It has recently been shown that perilipin may also be located at the plasma membrane (11Robenek H. Robenek M.J. Buers I.

Moreover, at the plasma membrane perilipin was found associated with caveolae membrane that contained triacylglycerol synthesized from exogenous fatty acids (12Ost A. Ortegren U. Gustavsson J. Nystrom F.H. Strålfors P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).In the present study we identified phosphorylated proteins in the plasma membrane of primary human adipocytes by applying our vectorial proteomics approach and mass spectrometry (13Aboulaich N. Vainonen J.P. Strålfors P. Vener A.V. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We found that perilipin, predominantly perilipin B, at the plasma membrane was phosphorylated on a cluster of three threonine residues (299, 301, and 306). Insulin and β-adrenergic treatment of adipocytes induced a reversible translocation of perilipin B to and from the plasma membrane, suggesting that the hormone-controlled association of perilipin B with the plasma membrane may act to protect the newly formed triacylglycerol in the plasma membrane from hydrolysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of Human Adipocytes and Preparation of Plasma Membrane Fractions—Subcutaneous fat tissue was obtained during elective abdominal surgery on female patients. All participants gave their informed approval, and the Local Ethics Committee approved our study. Adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion (14Strålfors P. Honnor R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and the cells preincubated in Krebs-Ringer solution (0.12 m NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4) containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.40, 3.5% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 100 nm phenylisopropyladenosine, 0.5 unit/ml adenosine deaminase with 2 mm glucose, at 37 °C and then incubated for 10 min with or without 100 nm insulin or with 100 nm isoproterenol. Plasma membrane fractions were obtained by homogenization of the cells at room temperature (22 °C) in 10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose, 25 mm NaF, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 4 mm iodoacetate. A plasma membrane-containing pellet obtained by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min was resuspended in 10 mm Tris/HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm Na3VO4. Plasma membranes were then purified by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation (15Oka Y. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8125-8133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Whole cell lysates were obtained by centrifugation of the cells through dinonylphtalate to remove the incubation medium and the cells were then lysed and boiled in SDS sample buffer containing protease and phosphates inhibitors (14Strålfors P. Honnor R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (9% acrylamide) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were blocked with milk proteins or bovine serum albumin and then incubated with mouse anti-phosphotyrosine PY20 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), rabbit anti-phosphoserine, rabbit anti-phosphothreonine (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), or guinea pig anti-perilipin polyclonal antibodies (Progen Biotechnik, Heidelberg, Germany), as indicated. Detection was done by incubation with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, followed by chemiluminescence detection using ECL plus according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences, Amersham, UK), and evaluated by chemiluminescence imaging (Las 1000; Fuji, Tokyo, Japan).Trypsin Treatment of Plasma Membranes and Phopshopeptide Enrichment—Isolated plasma membranes were washed three times with 25 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8, and the final protein concentration was adjusted to 3 mg/ml. Cysteines were reduced with 2 mm dithiothreitol and alkylated with 6 mm iodoacetamide, and the proteins were digested by trypsin (sequence-grade modified trypsin, Promega, at 1 mg per 50 mg of sample protein for 24 h at 37 °C). The generated peptides were separated from the plasma membranes by centrifugation at 170,000 × g for 1 h.Phosphopeptides were enriched by IMAC 2The abbreviations used are: IMAC, immobilized metal affinity chromatography; SRBC, a protein kinase Cδ-binding protein; SDPR, a protein kinase Cα-binding protein; PTRF, polymerase I and transcript release factor.

The peptides were methyl-esterified by 2 m methanolic HCl and then subjected to IMAC using a microcolumn (GELoader tip; Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) containing 7 μl of chelating Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) loaded with FeCl3. The methyl-esterified peptides were dried and dissolved in 10 μl of methanol/water/acetonitrile (1:1:1, by volume) before loading on the column. Non-specifically bound peptides were removed with 2 × 20 μl of 0.1% acetic acid in water, 2 × 20 μl of 0.1% acetic acid in 20% (v/v) acetonitrile, and 2 × 20 μl of 20% acetonitrile in water. Phosphopeptides were eluted by four washings with 10 μl of 20 mm Na2HPO4 in 20% acetonitrile. The four eluted fractions were separately collected and desalted using a C18 ZipTip (Millipore, Bedford, MA).Mass Spectrometry—The phosphopeptides were analyzed on a hybrid mass spectrometer API Q-STAR Pulsar i (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source (MDS Protana, Odense, Denmark). The desalted peptides (2 μl in 50% acetonitrile in water with 1% formic acid) were loaded into the nanoelectrospray capillaries. Mass spectra of the phosphopeptides fragmented by collision-induced dissociation were acquired with instrument settings recommended by Applied Biosystems with manual control of collision energy.RESULTSIdentification of Phosphorylated Proteins in the Plasma Membrane of Human Adipocytes—To identify phosphoproteins in the plasma membrane we subjected purified plasma membranes to proteolytic treatment with trypsin, which cleaves surface exposed domains of the membrane proteins (13Aboulaich N.

The enriched phosphopeptides were sequenced by nanospray quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We identified 26 phosphorylation sites in 10 proteins in the plasma membrane (Table 1). Serine phosphorylation at residues 5 and 37 of caveolin 1α and 1β isoforms in caveolae has previously been reported by us (17Vainonen J.P. Aboulaich N. Turkina M.V. Strålfors P. Vener A.V. Biochem.

The cytoskeleton-binding proteins talin 2 and spectrin IIβ were phosphorylated on threonine 1843 and serine 2089, respectively. Novel phosphorylation sites were also identified in the signal transduction proteins Cbl-associated protein (CAP), protein kinase Cδ-binding protein (SRBC), and protein kinase Cα-binding protein (SDPR). SDPR was phosphorylated on one threonine and three serine residues located in the same peptide (Table 1). In addition to four previously identified serine phosphorylation sites in polymerase I and transcript release factor (PTRF) (Ser-36, Ser-40, Ser-365, and Ser-366 (13Aboulaich N. Vainonen J.P.

Perilipin A-containing bands after SDS-PAGE have been reported to contain phosphothreonine, but no phosphorylation sites have been mapped earlier (7Mooney R.A. Bordwell K.L. Biochem.

Antibodies against phosphotyrosine identified the insulin receptor β-subunit in cells treated with insulin, but insulin treatment had no detectable effect on serine phosphorylation as examined with anti-phosphoserine antibodies (data not shown). Antibodies against phosphothreonine, on the other hand, identified four proteins that were extensively phosphorylated in the plasma membrane of cells treated with insulin (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Effects of insulin on perilipin at the plasma membrane and in whole cell lysates of human adipocytes.

Immunoblotting analysis with antibodies against PTRF did not match any of the phosphothreonine protein bands in Fig. 2A (data not shown), whereas immunoblotting with anti-perilipin antibodies demonstrated that threonine-phosphorylated bands corresponded to perilipin proteins (Fig. 3). Perilipin B was the major isoform in the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B), while perilipin A was the dominant isoform (>90%) in whole cell lysates of the human adipocytes (Fig. 2B), in agreement with a previous report that more than 85% of total perilipin in rat adipocytes is perilipin A (9Greenberg A.S.

This very marked enrichment of perilipin B at the plasma membrane indicates a specific function of this isoform in the plasma membrane.FIGURE 3Identification of perilipin A and B in the plasma membrane as threonine-phosphorylated proteins. 5 μg of protein of the plasma membrane, isolated from primary human adipocytes incubated with insulin, was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was performed with two antibodies after cutting the lane into two parts. One part was blotted with anti-perilipin and the other with anti-phosphothreonine antibody (P-Thr) as indicated. Perilipin A (Peri A) and perilipin B (Peri B) were identified by their relative electrophoretic mobilities (9Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Adipocytes were incubated with insulin or isoproterenol and the plasma membranes were isolated. Immunoblotting with anti-perilipin antibodies revealed that insulin recruited threonine-phosphorylated perilipin B and perilipin A to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B). The increase of perilipin B was 11.0 ± 5.9-fold and of perilipin A 11.2 ± 4.8-fold (mean ± S.E., n = 3) in the plasma membrane in response to insulin treatment of the intact adipocytes. Isoproterenol, on the other hand, induced a very marked and specific depletion of perilipin B from the plasma membrane, apparently without affecting perilipin A, which remained in the plasma membrane (Fig. 4A). The migration shift of perilipin A in the gel after separation by SDS-PAGE is likely the result of increased serine phosphorylation in response to isoproterenol stimulation, as has been demonstrated in whole cells (5Greenberg A.S.

Also there was no significant effect on the amount of perilipin in the cells by either hormone (Figs. 2B and 4A).DISCUSSIONIn the present study we applied a proteomics approach (13Aboulaich N. Vainonen J.P. Strålfors P. Vener A.V. Biochem. J. 2004; 383: 237-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) to study protein phosphorylation in the plasma membrane of human adipocytes. This allowed us to identify novel phosphorylation sites in a number of different proteins located at the plasma membrane, in particular threonine phosphorylation of perilipin. Key findings of this investigation were: first, that perilipin is triply phosphorylated on a tight cluster of threonine residues; second, that perilipin B is specifically associated with the plasma membrane of human adipocytes; and third, that this association is under insulin and β-adrenergic control.Insulin increased the amount of perilipin A and B at the plasma membrane, while perilipin B was depleted at the plasma membrane in response to β-adrenergic stimulation. Our findings also suggest that the translocation of perilipin to the plasma membrane in response to insulin may be threonine phosphorylation-dependent. It has been shown that a central domain of perilipin consisting of amino acid residues 233–364 is important for targeting of perilipin to the central lipid droplet (19Garcia A. Sekowski A. Subramanian V. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The domain structure of perilipin is outlined in Fig. 5. Mass spectrometry analysis of protein phosphorylation in the plasma membrane revealed three phosphorylated threonine residues (299, 301, and 306) tightly clustered within this central domain of perilipin (Fig. 5). This cluster of phosphorylated threonine residues was also within an acidic domain (amino acids 292–319), which forms part of the lipid droplet targeting domain (19Garcia A. Sekowski A. Subramanian V. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 625-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The acidic character of this domain is further increased by introduction of the negative charges contributed by the threonine phosphorylation identified here. It remains to determine the function of such enhanced negative charge of the acidic domain in controlling perilipin targeting.FIGURE 5Domain structure and phosphorylation sites of perilipin A and B. The numbers below the bars illustrating perilipin A and B correspond to the amino acids in the predicted human protein sequences. Amino acids 233–364 and 292–319 comprise the lipid-targeting domain and the acidic domain, respectively, as reported in Ref. 19Garcia A. Sekowski A. Subramanian V. Brasaemle D.L. J. Biol.

The positions of the predicted cAMP-dependent protein kinase serine phosphorylation sites (9Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The position of the identified threonine phosphorylation cluster is indicated by three vertical lines and T in perilipin B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have recently identified perilipin at the plasma membrane of primary rat adipocytes and demonstrated that perilipin is located to caveolae in insulin-treated adipocytes and that added long-chain fatty acids are rapidly converted to triacylglycerol in the membrane of the perilipin-containing caveolae (12Ost A. Ortegren U. Gustavsson J. Nystrom F.H. Strålfors P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Considering the established function of perilipin A to protect the central lipid droplet triacylglycerol from hydrolysis in the absence of lipolytic stimulation, it is likely that perilipin B is recruited to the plasma membrane in response to insulin to protect the freshly synthesized triacylglycerol (12Ost A. Ortegren U. Gustavsson J. Nystrom F.H. Strålfors P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) from hydrolysis by the hormone-sensitive lipase. This lipase was found to localize to the triacylglycerol-synthesizing caveolae specifically. 3U.Örtegren and P. Strålfors, unpublished data. The finding that lipolytic stimulation with isoproterenol specifically and completely depleted the plasma membrane of perilipin B also indicates such a function of perilipin B. In rat adipocytes almost 85% of the cellular perilipin has been reported to be the A isoform with the reminder constituting perilipin B (9Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Kimmel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 12035-12039Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In the human adipocytes very little perilipin B (<10% of total perilipin) was detected in the whole cell lysates (Figs. 2B and 4A), demonstrating a very strong dominance of the A isoform in the human cells. The exact proportion of perilipin B to perilipin A at the plasma membrane was found to vary somewhat between preparations from different individuals, but perilipin B was invariably highly enriched at the plasma membrane compared with whole cells. With this in mind there is a remarkable preference for perilipin B in the plasma membrane supporting its specific function at the plasma membrane.It is possible that the serine-phosphorylated perilipin A remaining in the plasma membrane after lipolytic activation by isoproterenol reflects a function of serine-phosphorylated perilipin A to support the hydrolysis of triacylglycerol in the plasma membrane, in agreement with a study showing that in perilipin null mice the hormone-sensitive lipase failed to translocate from the cytosol to the lipid"
https://openalex.org/W1999620178,"RecQ helicases are key genome maintenance enzymes that function in DNA replication, recombination, and repair. In contrast to nearly every other identified RecQ family member, the RecQ helicase from the radioresistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans encodes three “Helicase and RNase D C-terminal” (HRDC) domains at its C terminus. HRDC domains have been implicated in structure-specific nucleic acid binding with roles in targeting RecQ proteins to particular DNA structures; however, only RecQ proteins with single HRDC domains have been examined to date. We demonstrate that the HRDC domains can be proteolytically removed from the D. radiodurans RecQ (DrRecQ) C terminus, consistent with each forming a structural domain. Using this observation as a guide, we produced a panel of recombinant DrRecQ variants lacking combinations of its HRDC domains to investigate their biochemical functions. The N-terminal-most HRDC domain is shown to be critical for high affinity DNA binding and for efficient unwinding of DNA in some contexts. In contrast, the more C-terminal HRDC domains attenuate the DNA binding affinity and DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis rate of the enzyme and play more complex roles in structure-specific DNA unwinding. Our results indicate that the multiple DrRecQ HRDC domains have evolved to encode DNA binding and regulatory functions in the enzyme.

Deinococcus radiodurans is an extremophilic bacterial species with an astonishing ability to survive massive levels of DNA-damaging radiation. The D37 dose of ionizing radiation (amount needed to eliminate colony formation by 63% of cells in a population) for D. radiodurans is 6000 Gy. This amount of radiation induces an estimated 275 double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) 3The abbreviations used are: DSB, double-stranded DNA break; ss, single-stranded;HRDC, helicase and RNaseD C-terminal; DrRecQ, D. radiodurans RecQ; EcRecQ, E. coli RecQ; HJ, Holliday junction; 3′-OH, partial duplex DNA with a 3′-single-stranded overhang; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight. and 3,000 single-stranded (ss) DNA breaks per D. radiodurans genome (1Battista J.R.

In contrast, introduction of fewer than 10 DSBs/genome is lethal to Escherichia coli as well as to most other species studied to date (2Cox M.M. Battista J.R. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The robust radioresistance of D. radiodurans makes the bacterium an excellent model system for examining DNA repair mechanisms. Although many well known DNA repair genes are conserved in D. radiodurans, others are conspicuous in their absence (3White O. Eisen J.A. Heidelberg J.F. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Gwinn M.L. Nelson W.C. Richardson D.L. Moffat K.S. Qin H. Jiang L. Pamphile W. Crosby M. Shen M. Vamathevan J.J. Lam P. McDonald L. Utterback T. Zalewski C. Makarova K.S. Aravind L.

Perhaps the most surprising of these omissions are recB and recC, which encode proteins that are essential for the primary recombinational repair pathway in many bacteria. In the RecBCD pathway, DSBs are processed by the RecBCD helicase/nuclease to create 3′-ssDNA ends onto which RecBCD loads the recombinase protein RecA (4Kowalczykowski S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 156-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). RecA, in turn, catalyzes homology-dependent invasion of 3′-ssDNA into double-stranded DNA, which primes recombination-dependent replication and allows for repair of the break. In the absence of an apparent RecBCD pathway, the mechanisms responsible for the remarkable ability to repair DNA damage in D. radiodurans are unclear (3White O. Eisen J.A. Heidelberg J.F. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Gwinn M.L. Nelson W.C. Richardson D.L. Moffat K.S. Qin H. Jiang L. Pamphile W. Crosby M. Shen M. Vamathevan J.J. Lam P. McDonald L. Utterback T.

In recBC-E. coli, the RecF recombinational repair pathway can be activated to initiate homologous recombination, utilizing several proteins to substitute for the intrinsic activities of RecBCD (reviewed in Ref. 4Kowalczykowski S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 156-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). RecF pathway proteins include the RecQ DNA helicase and RecJ 5′-3′-ssDNA exonuclease that are thought to process DSBs, while the RecF, RecO, and RecR proteins mediate RecA loading onto ssDNA (6Hegde S.P. Qin M.H. Li X.H. Atkinson M.A. Clark A.J. Rajagopalan M. Madiraju M.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14468-14473Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 7Morimatsu K.

Activation of the RecF pathway in E. coli requires mutation of the sbcB gene (encoding Exonuclease I, a 3′-5′-ssDNA nuclease) (9Horii Z. Clark A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 327-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), which is thought to be important for preserving the 3′-ssDNA produced by the combined activities of RecQ and RecJ. In contrast to the missing recB and recC, genes encoding RecF pathway proteins are present in D. radiodurans and an sbcB gene is absent (3White O. Eisen J.A. Heidelberg J.F. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D.

Thus, it appears that a RecF-like pathway may perform an expanded role in D. radiodurans DNA repair pathways relative to that in wild-type E. coli. These observations have led to investigations into the structures and functions of D. radiodurans RecF pathway proteins that have thus far focused primarily on RecA (11Kim J.I. Cox M.M. Proc. Natl.

In E. coli RecQ (EcRecQ), the Helicase and RecQ-Ct regions fold as a single structural domain referred to as the “catalytic core”, whereas the HRDC region forms a second structural domain (24Bernstein D.A. Keck J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2778-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Within the catalytic core domain, the Helicase region contains conserved sequence motifs that couple ATP hydrolysis to DNA unwinding and the RecQ-Ct region encodes Zn2+-binding and winged helix subdomains that are thought to be important for structural stability and interactions with DNA and proteins (25Bernstein D.A. Zittel M.C. Keck J.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4910-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 26Liu J.L. Rigolet P. Dou S.X. Wang P.Y. Xi X.G. J. Biol.

A. 2005; 102: 18379-18384Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). HRDC domains have been found in both ribonucleases and helicases, suggesting a broad role in nucleic acid binding (23Morozov V. Mushegian A.R. Koonin E.V. Bork P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 417-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and isolated HRDC domains from EcRecQ, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sgs1, and human WRN all bind DNA, albeit with different structural preferences (28Liu Z.

RecQ proteins in which the HRDC domain has been inactivated can usually function as DNA-dependent ATPases and helicases but often have altered DNA binding activities. For example, removal or mutation of EcRecQ HRDC domain produces variants with normal helicase and ATPase activities but with altered structure-specific DNA binding properties (24Bernstein D.A. Keck J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2778-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 30Bernstein D.A. Keck J.L. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 1173-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Similarly, removal or mutation of the HRDC domain in the human BLM protein greatly weakens its binding to and dissolution of double Holliday Junction (HJ) DNA (31Wu L. Lung Chan K. Ralf C. Bernstein D.A. Garcia P.L. Bohr V.A. Vindigni A. Janscak P. Keck J.L. Hickson I.D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2679-2687Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), although HRDC-lacking BLM protein is still able to able to hydrolyze ATP and unwind simpler DNA structures (32Janscak P. Garcia P.L. Hamburger F. Makuta Y. Shiraishi K. Imai Y. Ikeda H. Bickle T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 29-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). HRDC deletion variants from the S. cerevisiae Sgs1 also retain their basic helicase functions in vitro and, in most contexts, their activity in vivo (33Lu J. Mullen J.R. Brill S.J. Kleff S. Romeo A.M. Sternglanz R. Nature. 1996; 383: 678-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 34Bennett R.J. Sharp J.A. Wang J.C. J. Biol.

DrRecQ contains a domain architecture similar to RecQ helicases from other organisms. However, in contrast to most other RecQ proteins, DrRecQ encodes three HRDC domains (HRDC1, HRDC2, and HRDC3, in order from N- to C-terminal) (Fig. 1). In this report, we have described the structure-specific DNA binding, DNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis, and DNA unwinding properties of DrRecQ and of a panel of deletion variants that lack either individual HRDC domains or combinations of these domains. Our results indicate that each DrRecQ HRDC domain has a distinct effect on these activities. HRDC1 is required for high affinity DNA binding and is critical for unwinding HJ DNA. HRDC2 attenuates DrRecQ ssDNA binding but stimulates HJ binding; interestingly, HRDC2 also inhibits DNA unwinding. HRDC3 attenuates ssDNA and HJ DNA binding but appears to have no effect on DNA unwinding. In addition, successive removal of HRDC domains from the DrRecQ C terminus increases its maximal ssDNA-dependent ATP hydrolysis rates. Based on our findings, we propose a model where D. radiodurans RecQ activity is regulated by its HRDC domains. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of DrRecQ Constructs—D. radiodurans cell culture and genomic DNA isolation were carried out as previously described (37Earl A.M. Mohundro M.M. Mian I.S. Battista J.R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6216-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The recQ gene from D. radiodurans was amplified from strain R1 genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. Products were cloned into the pET28.b bacterial expression vector (Novagen) using NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. Domain variants of DrRecQ were constructed similarly to create pMK102 (encoding residues 1-728, DrRecQ-2HRDC), pMK103 (residues 1-610, DrRecQ-1HRDC), pMK104 (residues 1-519, DrRecQΔC), pMK105 (residues 518-824, 3HRDC), pMK106 (residues 534-610, HRDC1), pMK107 (residues 654-729, HRDC2), pMK108 (residues 751-824, HRDC3), pMK109 (residues 534-729, HRDC1 + 2), and pMK110 (residues 654-824, HRDC2 + 3). Each plasmid encodes a His6 purification tag and thrombin cleavage site on the N terminus of the DrRecQ variant. The fidelity of all D. radiodurans recQ genes was confirmed by DNA sequencing. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with pMK101 (or another DrRecQ variant expression vector) were grown in Luria-Bertani medium (38Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: A2.2Google Scholar) supplemented with 50 mg/ml of kanamycin at 37 °C with orbital shaking. Protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to cells at mid-log phase (A600 = 0.6). Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min at 13,000 × g) after 4 h of induction and frozen overnight at -80 °C. Pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 10 mm imidazole), lysed by sonication on ice, and clarified by centrifugation (30 min at 28,000 × g). Soluble lysate was loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA column and washed with lysis buffer. His-tagged protein was eluted with lysis buffer adjusted to 250 mm imidazole and dialyzed overnight against lysis buffer lacking imidazole. Protein in the dialysate was cleaved with thrombin to remove the His tag (a Gly-Ser-His sequence remains on the N terminus) and passed over an additional Ni2+ -NTA column to remove remaining contaminants. Unbound protein was concentrated and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-100 size exclusion column in 10mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. RecQ fractions were pooled and concentrated to >50 μm, dialyzed against storage buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 40% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mm EDTA), and stored at -20 °C. All protein concentrations were determined by measuring A280 in 6.0 m guanidine-HCl (39Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3009) Google Scholar), and purity was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Limited Proteolysis of D. radiodurans RecQ—Purified DrRecQ was mixed with chymotrypsin at a 100:1 DrRecQ:protease ratio in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA at room temperature. Reactions were quenched at 0, 1, 5, 15, or 30 min by the addition of 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and SDS gel running buffer, stored on dry ice, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Proteolysis fragments were excised from the gel, digested with trypsin, and subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (University of Wisconsin Mass Spectrometry facility) for identification of DrRecQ peptides retained in each band. In separate experiments, proteolysis fragments were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride and subjected to N-terminal sequencing (Medical College of Wisconsin Protein/DNA facility). Synthetic DNA Substrates—Synthetic oligonucleotides dT28, o18 (5′AAGCACAATTACCCACGC-3′), o30 (5′-GCGTGGGTAATTGTGCTTCAATGGACTGAC-3′), oHolliday1 (5′-GCCGTGATCACCAATGCAGATTGACGAACCTTTGCCCACGT-3′), oHolliday2 (5′-GACGTGGGCAAAGGTTCGTCAATGGACTGACAGCTGCATGG-3′), oHolliday3 (5′-GCCATGCAGCTGTCAGTCCATTGTCATGCTAGGCCTACTGC-3′), oHolliday4 (5′-GGCAGTAGGCCTAGCATGACAATCTGCATTGGTGATCACGG-3′), 3′-fluorescein-labeled o18, 3′-fluorescein-labeled o30, and 5′-fluorescein-labeled oHolliday1 were purchased from MWG Biotech. 3′-OH substrate was created by annealing o30-o18 in equimolar amounts, forming an 18-base pair duplex region with a 12-base 3′-single-stranded extension. HJ substrate was created by annealing equimolar amounts oHolliday1, oHolliday2, oHolliday3, and oHolliday4, which forms a structure with four 20-base pair duplex arms extending from a central four-way junction. All substrates were annealed by boiling for 5 min and allowing the mixture to slow cool for 30 min at room temperature. For fluorescence polarization substrates, 3′-fluorescein-labeled o18 and 5′-fluorescein-labeled oHolliday1 oligonucleotides were incorporated into the 3′-OH and HJ structures and 3′-fluorescein-labeled o30 was used as ssDNA. DNA Binding Assays—Purified DrRecQ variants were serially diluted in dilution buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 g/liter of bovine serum albumin, 4% (v/v) glycerol). Diluted proteins were incubated with 1 nm DNA substrate for 20 min at room temperature in a total reaction volume of 100 μl. The fluorescence polarization of each sample was measured at 25 °C using a Panvera Beacon 2000 fluorescence polarization system with 490 and 535 nm excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. The fraction of substrate bound in each sample was calculated by setting the anisotropy value of the fluorescein-labeled substrate in buffer alone (values were ∼45 millianisotropy (mA) units) to zero and setting the anisotropy value at 10 μm protein concentration (values were ∼220 mA) to 100% bound. Reactions were performed in triplicate and are plotted as the average fraction DNA bound in the trials with error bars representing one S.D. Uncertainty in the estimated Kd,app values was calculated by determining the standard deviation of the average Kd,app from three independent trials. DNA-dependent ATPase Assays—ATPase assays were performed as previously described (24Bernstein D.A. Keck J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 2778-2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). 0.001-100 nm (molecules) dT28 was used to stimulate the ATPase activity of the DrRecQ variants. Reactions were performed in triplicate; average specific activities and error bars representing one S.D. of the mean are plotted. Helicase Assays—The 5′-end of oligonucleotides o18 and oHolliday 1 were phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase with [γ-32P]ATP, annealed to their respective complimentary oligonucleotide(s) as described under “Synthetic DNA Substrates” above, resolved by 12% native PAGE, and isolated by electroelution. DNA substrates were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl. DrRecQ variants were incubated with ∼1nm substrate for 30 min at room temperature in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 0.1 g/liter bovine serum albumin, and 4% (v/v) glycerol. Reactions were quenched with the addition of 11% (v/v) glycerol, 0.29% SDS, and 5 ng of unlabeled o18 or oHolliday1. Products were resolved by 12% native PAGE, dried, and imaged using a Amersham Biosciences Storm 820 Phosphorimager. Gel images were quantified using Image-Quant 5.1 software. The percent of DNA unwound is plotted as the average of three trials, and error bars represent one S.D. of the mean. Half-maximal unwinding is defined as the concentration of protein required to unwind 50% of the substrate. Comparison of EcRecQ and DrRecQ HRDC Domains—The prototypical bacterial RecQ domain composition is defined by helicase, RecQ-Ct, and HRDC sequence elements in order from N to C terminus. All but four of the currently identifiable bacterial RecQ protein sequences appear to conform to this general structure (data not shown). The outlying RecQ proteins are differentiated by the presence of multiple HRDC domains at their C termini. These unusual RecQ proteins are found in Rhodobacter sphaeroides (two HRDC domains) as well as in D. radiodurans, Neisseria gonorrhea, and Neisseria meningitidis (three HRDC domains). Although RecQ proteins containing a single HRDC domain appear to use this domain as a DNA substrate specificity determinant, the functions of multiple HRDC domains on RecQ helicases have not been previously investigated. Comparison of the EcRecQ HRDC domain with the three HRDC domains of DrRecQ reveals similarities among the domains that is strongest for the first DrRecQ HRDC domain and somewhat weaker for its more C-terminal domains (Fig. 1). The EcRecQ HRDC domain shares 65% similarity and 40% identity with DrRecQ HRDC1, 64% similarity and 36% identity with DrRecQ HRDC2, and 59% similarity and 33% identity with DrRecQ HRDC3. Of the ∼44 residues connecting HRDC1 and HRDC2 and 21 residues connecting HRDC2 and HRDC3 of DrRecQ, one third are either proline or glycine. A total of 14 residues are invariant among the three DrRecQ and single EcRecQ HRDC domains (Fig. 1b). The side chains from 8 of these residues are non-polar and contribute to the hydrophobic core, and 3 others are glycines that form borders of two α-helices in the EcRecQ HRDC domain structure (30Bernstein D.A. Keck J.L. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 1173-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The remaining 3 invariant residues (2 arginines and 1 glutamic acid) have charged side chains that map to the surface of the EcRecQ HRDC domain. Mutagenesis of the EcRecQ HRDC domain has identified 6 positively charged or aromatic residues that are important for ssDNA binding (30Bernstein D.A. Keck J.L. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 1173-1182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In each of the DrRecQ HRDC domains, only a subset of these residues is conserved (Fig. 1b). Therefore, it appears that the multiple HRDC domains of D. radiodurans RecQ are not simple repetitive copies of the EcRecQ HRDC domain and each has distinguishing sequence characteristics that may confer specialized functions. Limited Proteolysis Defines the Domain Structure of DrRecQ—To examine the low resolution domain structure of DrRecQ, we performed limited proteolysis on purified DrRecQ. The products formed by limited proteolytic treatment were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry to identify proteolytically resistant domains in DrRecQ. Gel analysis of the reaction products revealed four major bands that migrated faster than full-length DrRecQ (Fig. 2a, lanes 5-9). The estimated masses of these fragments were 85 kDa (band 1), 69 kDa (band 2), 57 kDa (band 3), and 51 kDa (band 4). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of trypsin-derived peptide fragments from excised bands 1-4 indicated that successively fewer C-terminal peptides could be detected in the faster migrating bands (Fig. 2b). In addition, the intensity of the C-terminal-most peptides was diminished in the higher mobility bands. These differences were consistent with proteolytic removal of individual HRDC domains from DrRecQ. More definitive N-terminal sequencing attempts failed to identify the specific protease-sensitive sites, perhaps because of heterogeneity of the fragments (data not shown). Based on this analysis, DrRecQ variants with successive truncations of each of the HRDC domains were recombinantly produced and purified. The SDS-PAGE migration of these proteins was strikingly similar to the limited proteolysis products (Fig. 2a, lanes 1-9), consistent with our hypothesis that the DrRecQ fragments differ by removal of one or more HRDC domains. Additional recombinant proteins containing each individual DrRecQ HRDC domain (HRDC1, HRDC2, and HRDC3), each pairwise combination (HRDC1 + 2 and HRDC2 + 3), and the triple HRDC sequence (3HRDC) were also purified for biochemical analysis. Circular dichroic spectra and/or structure determination of the single, double, and triple HRDC constructs indicated that the HRDC constructs were folded and highly α-helical (data not shown). DNA Binding by DrRecQ Variants—The DNA binding properties of each DrRecQ variant was assessed by measuring its equilibrium binding affinity to three different synthetic DNA substrates: ssDNA, 3′-OH DNA, and HJ DNA. Given the many previous reports of HRDC-mediated DNA binding, the effects of removing the DrRecQ HRDC domains on its ssDNA binding affinity were surprising (Fig. 3a). The apparent dissociation constant (Kd, app) measured for DrRecQ binding to ssDNA was 12 ± 2nm. However, DrRecQ-2HRDC, which lacks HRDC3, had an increased ssDNA binding affinity (Kd,app of 2.8 ± 0.4 nm). Furthermore, DrRecQ-1HRDC, which lacks both HRDC2 and HRDC3, had an even greater enhancement of ssDNA binding affinity relative to full-length protein, with a Kd,app of less than 1 ± 0.2 nm for DrRecQ-1HRDC. An upper limit for Kd,app is given because the binding experiment includes 1 nm DNA and the DrRecQ-1HRDC concentration required for half-maximal binding is ∼1nm, making substrate concentration limiting and implying that the true Kd for the binding reaction is below 1 nm. In contrast, removal of all three HRDC domains from DrRecQ (DrRecQΔC) dramatically decreases affinity for ssDNA as is evident by its 380 ± 50 nm Kd, app. Thus, HRDC2 and HRDC3 appear to inhibit high affinity ssDNA binding, whereas HRDC1 forms a critical ssDNA binding element when linked to the DrRecQ catalytic core domain. To test whether the HRDC domains alone are sufficient for ssDNA binding, we measured the binding affinity of a construct comprising just the three HRDC domains (3HRDC). This construct bound ssDNA with a Kd,app of ∼47 ± 1 nm. Interestingly, each of th"

The interaction of flowing magnetospheric plasma with the plume modifies the particle and field environment of Enceladus. The structure of Saturn's magnetosphere, the extended region of space threaded by magnetic-field lines linked to the planet, is shaped by the ion source at Enceladus, and magnetospheric dynamics may be affected by the rate at which fresh ions are created."

The effect is shown to be consistent with combined influence of thermal and gravimetric separation, with the thermal contribution being more important."
https://openalex.org/W2049209778,"The Cassini spacecraft has been touring Saturn's neighborhood since it entered orbit there on 1 July 2004. As well as interrogating the giant planet and its filigree rings, understanding the formation of Saturn's moons is one of the key goals of the mission. Saturn has 35 named moons in its family, as well as a plethora of smaller objects hidden in the rings. The variety of moons is staggering. Some consist of exposed rock; others are enveloped in thick ice. Some are pock-marked with billion-year-old craters; others varnished with fresh snow. Cassini's busy schedule included more than 20 encounters with Saturn's moons in the past year, offering but a sampling of these different worlds.

One of the most curious of all Saturn's moons is Enceladus. The sixth largest saturnian satellite—although at a mere 504 km across, its width is smaller than that of Arizona or Spain—Enceladus rides in the middle of Saturn's E ring, a wide and diffuse blue ring of fine particles. Because this ring lacks the bigger shards characteristic of ancient satellite smash-ups, astronomers have long suspected that the E-ring particles emanate from Enceladus itself.

Earlier Earth-based and Voyager space probe images revealed that Enceladus' surface is icy and complex. Old cratered terrains butt up against newly resurfaced smooth ice flows. So Cassini scientists hoped to see signs of recent activity and possibly ice volcanism. As the papers in this special issue show, their anticipation was rewarded. In three flybys, in February, March, and July 2005, Cassini trained its instruments on Enceladus. The first two cruises descended to about 1000 and 500 km above the moon's equator. Onboard cameras snapped images of lines of folded mountain ridges and cracked white ice plains streaked with dark green organic material. The magnetometer saw signs of ions leaking out from Enceladus'atmosphere, and it localized, in the second flyby, a strong outflow from the south pole. The trajectory of the third flyby on 14 July 2005 was then adjusted to fly through the emergent gas just 168 km above the south pole.

The flybys show that Enceladus' south polar landscape is still active today and is being resurfaced by cryovolcanism and fresh snowfall. Tidal forces have twisted and buckled the surface ice, producing long ridges and fractures. At infrared wavelengths, the south pole actually glows. An underground heat source lies beneath a surface grid of “tiger stripes”: a parallel set of linear trenches stained with dark organic material. From these warm vents, water vapor, ice, and dust particles are lofted in a spectacular plume, like spray from a Yellowstone geyser. Ions are driven further into the atmosphere and out into the magnetosphere of Saturn itself and the E ring. The rate at which water is being blown out is enough to replenish not only the E ring but also oxygen throughout the whole saturnian system.

So is the mystery of Enceladus solved? Not at all. Finding such active geology on such a tiny moon is a big surprise. Neptune's Triton and Jupiter's Io have ice and sulfur volcanoes, respectively, but are larger bodies; Europa has experienced plate tectonics but no current activity is seen there. Yet tiny Enceladus produces a plume large enough to drench the whole Saturn system. The origin of Enceladus' internal heating is also still a major puzzle. To produce the plume, water needs to be boiled off or sublimated. Ammonia could act as antifreeze but was not detected by Cassini. Does liquid water, or locked-up ammonia, lie beneath the surface? We may need to wait for future missions to this enigmatic moon to find out for sure, but Enceladus is definitely on the map."
