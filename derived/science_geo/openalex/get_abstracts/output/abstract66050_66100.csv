The extraneous sound seems to occur during another portion of the sentence without interfering with the intelligibility of any phoneme. If silence replaces a speech sound, the gap is correctly localized and the absence of the speech sound detected."

This inequality is not found by recording the electroretinogram. Thus, orientational effects must arise between the site of origin of the electroretinogram and the evoked cortical response."

Particles that escape estuaries or are discharged by rivers into the shelf region tend to travel longshoreward rather than seaward. Suspended matter farther offshore, chiefly amorphous organic particles, totals 0.1 milligram per liter or less. Soot, fly ash, processed cellulose, and other pollutants are widespread."

Individual chromosmes representing, each set of four of the Hyla versicolor karyotype correspond closely with those of the diploid (2n = 24) Hyla andersonii karyotype."

https://openalex.org/W1970121935,A questionnaire submitted to 1059 students and faculty at Cornell University revealed general agreement (84%) on the desirability of limiting family size although 65% wanted 3 children or more. About half favored the pill over all available means. Voluntary sterilization was favored by only 6% males and 2% of the females. A majority (52% of males and 61% of females) said they would never undergo sterilization. Biologists and nonbiologists graduate students and freshmen were equally uninformed about sexual sterilization.

So far only organic ligands from various litters have been found to be capable of reducing and bleaching ferric compounds in soil during gleying1,2, but the involvement of certain unknown iron reducing bacteria seems to be more likely, for iron reduction has been found to stop in a submerged soil when bacterial inhibitors are added3. Aerobic as well as anaerobic bacteria, capable of reducing ferric oxide, have been abundant in the soils studied, whether gleying was detectable or not4,5. As far as gleying is concerned, the most important iron reducing bacteria are likely to be the anaerobic, nitrogen-fixing clostridia, with properties that would suit them to the poor and anaerobic conditions of gleyed subsoils. If these nitrogen fixers are implicated in gleying, they should be able to reproduce the characteristic features of gleying, even in laboratory conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2032844334,"Retention in the pigeon and in the goldfish was measured 1 day or 2 weeks after the mastery of each of a series of color discrimination. The amount of forgetting in the pigeon increased with the number of prior problems and increased more rapidly at the longer than at the shorter interval. the amount of forgetting in the goldfish was independent, at both intervals, of the number of prior problems. These results point to the operation of different memory mechanisms in the two animals."

https://openalex.org/W2076495309,"IN a recent report1 R. D. Wiffen and M. J. Heard request identification of hollow particles, 0.5 micron in diameter, which were collected in an atmospheric aerosol at Harwell Atomic Energy Research Establishment. These appear to be solid excretory products known as brochosomes, produced by homopterous insects. These structures were first discovered adhering to the wings2 and were later shown to originate in the Malpighian tubules of the gut3, occurring in Golgi vesicles. A special behaviour pattern exists by which the hind legs distribute excrement over the wings5. One configuration is a twenty-sided polyhedron comprising eight hexagons and twelve pentagons4, which is identical to the much larger polyhedra of a radiolarian skeleton (Dorataspis cristata)6. Thompson noted6 that such polyhedra can only exist if there is distortion in either edges or facets. These systems have obvious parallels with the quasi-equivalently related protein subunits in icosahedral virus shells7. The brochosomes consist of lipoprotein and may occur in various other configurations8."

https://openalex.org/W2007885643,"RATES of evolutionary change in the size and shape of hominid cheek teeth were not constant during the Pleistocene1. Because of the widespread interest in the relationship between the use of tools and the evolution of human canine teeth, I now present data for rates of evolutionary change in hominid canines. Evolutionary rates should be rapid at times of strong selective pressure for larger or smaller canines. My data, however, do not support the orthodox view2 that a reduction in size of the canine accompanied the appearance or early development of tool making by the precedessors of man."

In the case of 5-iodouridine (Fig. 1) it is particularly desirable to know the crystal structure in order to compare the effects of ionizing radiation on single crystals of 5-iodouridine with those on 5-iododeoxyuridine, using the technique of electron spin resonance1. Such studies may elucidate the effects of radiation on the nucleic acids themselves."

These structures are brochosomes, bizarre excretory products of the Malpighian tubules of leaf hoppers (Homoptera; Jassidae). They were discovered on wing membranes and elsewhere on the surface of these insects by Tulloch, Shapiro and Cochrane2 and Wilde and Cochrane3, who named these structures to accord with their net-like form. Subsequently it was found4, by examination of thin sections in the electron microscope, that brochosomes are produced intracellularly in the urine-secreting tubules; their eventual distribution over the surface cuticle seems to be achieved by the insect manipulating the excreted pellets with its posterior pair of legs5."
