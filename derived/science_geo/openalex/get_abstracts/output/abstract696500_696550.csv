https://openalex.org/W4284973752,"Studies demonstrating the waning of post-vaccination and post-infection immunity against covid-19 generally analyzed a limited range of vaccines or subsets of populations. Using Czech national health data from the beginning of the covid-19 pandemic till November 20, 2021 we estimated the risks of reinfection, breakthrough infection, hospitalization and death by a Cox regression adjusted for sex, age, vaccine type and vaccination status. Vaccine effectiveness against infection declined from 87% at 0-2 months after the second dose to 53% at 7-8 months for BNT162b2 vaccine, from 90% at 0-2 months to 65% at 7-8 months for mRNA-1273, and from 83% at 0-2 months to 55% at 5-6 months for the ChAdOx1-S. Effectiveness against hospitalization and deaths declined by about 15% and 10%, respectively, during the first 6-8 months. Boosters (third dose) returned the protection to the levels observed shortly after dose 2. In unvaccinated, previously infected individuals the protection against infection declined from 97% after 2 months to 72% at 18 months. Our results confirm the waning of vaccination-induced immunity against infection and a smaller decline in the protection against hospitalization and death. Boosting restores the original vaccine effectiveness. Post-infection immunity also decreases over time."
https://openalex.org/W4284971940,"Vaccine hesitancy is a global health challenge in controlling the virulence of pandemics. The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy will put highly vulnerable groups, such as the elderly or groups with pre-existing health conditions, at a higher risk, as seen with the outbreak of the pandemic Covid-19. Based on the trends of vaccine hesitancy in the state of Sabah, located in East Malaysia, this study seeks to identify several variables that contribute to vaccine hesitancy. In addition to this, this study also determines which groups are affected by vaccine hesitancy based on their demographics. This study is based on a sampling of 1,024 Sabahan population aged 18 and above through an online and face-to-face questionnaire. The raw data was analysed using the K-Means Clustering Analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Mann-Whitney U Test, Kruskal-Wallis Test, and frequency. The K-Means Clustering found that more than half of the total number of respondents (Cluster 2 = 51.9%) tend to demonstrate vaccine hesitancy. Based on the PCA analysis, six main factors were found to cause vaccine hesitancy in Sabah: confidence (var(X) = 21.6%), the influence of local authority (var(X) = 12.1%), ineffectiveness of mainstream media (var(X) = 8.4%), complacency (var(X) = 7.4%), social media (var(X) = 6.4%), and convenience issues (var(X) = 5.8%). Findings from both Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests demonstrate that several factors of group demographics, such as employment status, level of education, religion, gender, and marital status, may explain the indicator of vaccine hesitancy. In particular, specific groups tend to become vaccine hesitancy such as, unemployed, self-employed, students, male, single, level of education, and Muslim. Findings from this empirical study are crucial to inform the relevant local authorities on the level of vulnerability among certain groups in facing the hazards of COVID-19. The main contribution of this study is that it seeks to analyse the factors behind vaccine hesitancy and identifies which groups more likely hesitant toward vaccines based on their demographics."
https://openalex.org/W4284962717,"Due to the fragmentation of protected areas (PA), it is important to build ecological corridors in order to connect scattered PA and form protection networks for biodiversity conservation. We take the Chinese ecological conservation redline (ECR) as an example to study the construction of ecological corridors. China has defined ECR to improve the system of PA in key ecological functional zones, nature reserves, and areas of sensitive and fragile ecological environment. In this study, 187 core areas of ECR were identified using ArcGIS masking and dissolving technology to build corridors, covering 95% of the total ECR areas. Using the Linkage Mapper tool and the Pinchpoint Mapper, we identified 454 ecological corridors 68,794 km long. The results of the line density analysis showed that there are 9 key regional biological corridors connected to the ECR at the national scale, which must focus on protecting and strengthening ecological construction during the implementation of ecological conservation redline policy. Our study will provide references for developing a regional pattern of ecological security, territorial spatial planning, and will promote the implementation of biodiversity conservation policies."
https://openalex.org/W4284977602,"To provide evidence at the micro level for cracking the Solow productivity paradox, this paper deeply studies the impact of enterprise digital transformation on green innovation. In terms of theoretical research, three potential mechanisms are excavated for the first time; considering empirical research, a series of strict causal effect identification strategies are carried out. The results show that enterprise digital transformation can significantly promote green innovation, and it passes a series of robustness tests and endogenous tests. According to the theoretical and empirical results, the policy suggestions mainly include five points: helping enterprises to accelerate digital transformation; strengthening the green innovation ability of enterprises; reducing internal and external costs and promoting the professional division of labor; piloting the digital transformation policy; enhancing corporate social responsibility. It provides a reference of experience and a path for other countries to follow in implementing a digital transformation strategy and green sustainable development strategy."
https://openalex.org/W4284957967,"Midazolam is a widely used short-acting benzodiazepine. However, midazolam is also criticized for its deliriogenic potential. Since delirium is associated with a malfunction of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, midazolam appears to interfere with its proper metabolism, which can be triggered by epigenetic modifications. Consequently, we tested the hypothesis that midazolam indeed changes the expression and activity of cholinergic genes by acetylcholinesterase assay and qPCR. Furthermore, we investigated the occurrence of changes in the epigenetic landscape by methylation specific PCR, ChiP-Assay and histone ELISA. In an in-vitro model containing SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, U343 glioblastoma cells, and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we found that midazolam altered the activity of acetylcholinesterase /buturylcholinesterase (AChE / BChE). Interestingly, the increased expression of the buturylcholinesterase evoked by midazolam was accompanied by a reduced methylation of the BCHE gene and the di-methylation of histone 3 lysine 4 and came along with an increased expression of the lysine specific demethylase KDM1A. Last, inflammatory cytokines were not induced by midazolam. In conclusion, we found a promising mechanistic link between midazolam treatment and delirium, due to a significant disruption in cholinesterase homeostasis. In addition, midazolam seems to provoke profound changes in the epigenetic landscape. Therefore, our results can contribute to a better understanding of the hitherto poorly understood interactions and risk factors of midazolam on delirium."
https://openalex.org/W4284960732,"This paper attempts to introduce central bank digital currency (CBDC) into the analysis framework of monetary policy, and studies the influence mechanism of e-CNY, central bank digital currency in China, on the monetary policy of the central bank from the aspects of money demand, money supply and monetary policy transmission mechanism. The research finds that e-CNY will have significant impact on monetary policy: (1) E-CNY will change the structure of money demand, speed up currency circulation, make central bank reserves more controllable and money supply more intelligent; (2) E-CNY will increase the volatility and expansion effect of currency multiplier to a certain extent; (3) E-CNY will dredge the transmission channel of monetary policy so as to improve the transmission effect of existing monetary policy tools. At the same time, based on the organic combination with structural monetary policy tools, it will achieve precise implementation of medium-term lending facilities (MLF), pledged supplementary lending (PSL), and it may bring new monetary policy tools. (4) E-CNY will make the intermediate target of monetary policy more controllable and reliable, and have a positive impact on the target of monetary policy through the smooth transmission of monetary policy channels. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the research on CBDC, give full play to the positive role of e-CNY in monetary policy, and improve the effectiveness of monetary policy."
https://openalex.org/W4284962651,"Background Physical exercise may support brain health and cognition over the course of typical aging. The goal of this nonrandomized clinical trial was to examine the effect of an acute bout of aerobic exercise on brain blood flow and blood neurotrophic factors associated with exercise response and brain function in older adults with and without possession of the Apolipoprotein epsilon 4 (APOE4) allele, a genetic risk factor for developing Alzheimer’s. We hypothesized that older adult APOE4 carriers would have lower cerebral blood flow regulation and would demonstrate blunted neurotrophic response to exercise compared to noncarriers. Methods Sixty-two older adults (73±5 years old, 41 female [67%]) consented to this prospectively enrolling clinical trial, utilizing a single arm, single visit, experimental design, with post-hoc assessment of difference in outcomes based on APOE4 carriership. All participants completed a single 15-minute bout of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise. The primary outcome measure was change in cortical gray matter cerebral blood flow in cortical gray matter measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) arterial spin labeling (ASL), defined as the total perfusion (area under the curve, AUC) following exercise. Secondary outcomes were changes in blood neurotrophin concentrations of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Results Genotyping failed in one individual (n = 23 APOE4 carriers and n = 38 APOE4 non-carriers) and two participants could not complete primary outcome testing. Cerebral blood flow AUC increased immediately following exercise, regardless of APOE4 carrier status. In an exploratory regional analyses, we found that cerebral blood flow increased in hippocampal brain regions, while showing no change in cerebellum across both groups. Among high inter-individual variability, there were no significant changes in any of the 3 neurotrophic factors for either group immediately following exercise. Conclusions Our findings show that both APOE4 carriers and non-carriers show similar effects of exercise-induced increases in cerebral blood flow and neurotrophic response to acute aerobic exercise. Our results provide further evidence that acute exercise-induced increases in cerebral blood flow may be regional specific, and that exercise-induced neurotrophin release may show a differential effect in the aging cardiovascular system. Results from this study provide an initial characterization of the acute brain blood flow and neurotrophin responses to a bout of exercise in older adults with and without this known risk allele for cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s disease.

https://openalex.org/W4284965498,"Nucleotide Excision Repair is one of the five DNA repair systems. More than 30 proteins are involved in this process, including the seven XP proteins. When mutated, the genes coding for these proteins are provoking the rare disease Xeroderma Pigmentosum, which causes cutaneous defects and a high prevalence of skin cancers in patients. The CSA and CSB proteins are also involved in Nucleotide Excision Repair, and their mutation leads to Cockayne Syndrome, another rare disease, causing dwarfism, neurodegeneration, and ultimately early death, but without high skin cancer incidence. Some mutations of ERCC5, the gene coding for XPG, may give rise to a combined Xeroderma Pigmentosum and Cockayne Syndrome. A defect in Nucleotide Excision Repair alone cannot explain all these phenotypes. XPG has been located in the nucleolus, where ribosome biogenesis happens. This energy-consuming process starts with the transcription of the ribosomal DNA in a long ribosomal RNA, the pre-rRNA 47S, by RNA Polymerase 1. 47S pre-rRNA undergoes several cleavages and modifications to form three mature products: the ribosomal RNAs 18S, 5.8S and 28S. In the cytoplasm, these three products will enter the ribosomes' composition, the producers of protein in our cells. Our work aimed to observe ribosome biogenesis in presence of an unstable XPG protein. By working on Xeroderma Pigmentosum/Cockayne Syndrome cell lines, meaning in the absence of XPG, we uncovered that the binding of UBF, as well as the number of unresolved R-loops, is increased along the ribosomal DNA gene body and flanking regions. Furthermore, ribosomal RNA maturation is impaired, with increased use of alternative pathways of maturation as well as an increase of immature precursors. These defective processes may explain the neurodegeneration observed when the XPG protein is heavily truncated, as ribosomal homeostasis and R-loops resolution are critical for proper neuronal development."
https://openalex.org/W4284966178,"Staphylococcus aureus is the primary cause of bacteremia, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia is associated with a high mortality rate. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus clones are widespread worldwide, and molecular epidemiological studies are important. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the characteristics of patients who died due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia and microbiological characteristics of methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains in a tertiary teaching hospital. This single-center, retrospective study included patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolated from blood bacterial culture performed at Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine Hospital, from October 2016 to May 2019. The data analyzed included patient background, clinical strain characteristics, and molecular epidemiology. Of 41 patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia (median age, 60 [28-70] years; 24 (59%) were men), and 7 (17%) died due to methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia. The median age of those who died in the methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia group was predominantly higher than that of those in the alive group (p = 0.03). The most common cause of methicillin-resistant S. aureus bacteremia was endovascular devices, which occurred in 20 (49%), 18 (53%), and 2 (29%) patients in the total, alive, and died groups, respectively. Bacteriological characteristics showed that type IV Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec genotype was most frequently detected in the total (n = 34 [83%]), alive (n = 29 [85%]), and died (n = 5 [71%]) groups. In the molecular cluster analysis, CC8, ST8, staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome mec type IV, and community-acquired-methicillin-resistant S. aureus formed the largest groups. The diversity of methicillin-resistant S. aureus clones is evident, and it is possible that clones with new virulence factors may still emerge. In the future, it will be crucial to monitor the epidemiological trends of methicillin-resistant S. aureus to respond quickly to changes in pathogenic and clonal factors, to clarify the gene expression network by identifying old and new virulence factors."
https://openalex.org/W4284970600,"Free-living amoebae (FLA) are gaining attention due to the increasing number of related grave central nervous system (CNS) and sight-threatening eye infections and their role as Trojan horses for many bacteria and viruses. This study was conducted in Assiut City, Egypt to detect the presence of FLA in different water sources using morphological and molecular approaches and determine their potential pathogenicity. A total of 188 water samples (100 tap, 80 tank, and 8 swimming pool samples) were collected, cultivated on non-nutrient agar seeded with Escherichia coli, and inspected for FLA. Thermo- and osmo-tolerance assays were performed to determine their pathogenicity. Polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis were performed to confirm the identification and analyze the genotype. Overall, 52 samples (27.7%) were positive for FLA. Of these, 20.7% were identified as Acanthamoeba, 1.6% as Vahlkampfiidae, and 5.3% as mixed Acanthamoeba and Vahlkampfiidae. Seven species of Acanthamoeba were recognized, of which A. triangularis, A. polyphaga, A. lenticulata, and A. culbertsoni are thermo- and osmo-tolerant, and A. astronyxis, A. comandoni, and A. echinulata are non-thermo- and non-osmo-tolerant. The phylogeny analysis revealed T4 and T7 genotypes. Among Vahlkampfiids, 61.5% were identified as thermo- and osmo-tolerant Vahlkampfia, and 30.8% were identified as non-pathogenic Naegleria. One isolate (7.7%) was identified as potentially pathogenic Allovahlkampfia, as confirmed by sequencing. This is the first report documenting the occurrence and phylogeny of waterborne FLA (Acanthamoeba/Vahlkampfiidae) in Assiut, Egypt. The presence of potentially pathogenic FLA highlights the possible health hazards and the need for preventive measures."
https://openalex.org/W4284971790,"The last year of Covid-19 pandemic has been characterized by the continuous chase between the vaccination campaign and the appearance of new variants that puts further obstacles to the possibility of eradicating the virus and returning to normality in a short period. In the present paper we develop a deterministic compartmental model to describe the evolution of the Covid-19 in Italy as a combined effect of vaccination campaign, new variant spreading and mobility restrictions. Particular attention is given to the mechanism of waning immunity, appropriately timed with respect to the effective progress of the vaccination campaign in Italy. We perform a retrospective analysis in order to explore the role that different mechanisms, such as behavioral changes, variation of the population mobility, seasonal variability of the virus infectivity, and spreading of new variants have had in shaping the epidemiological curve. We find that, in the large time window considered, the most relevant mechanism is the seasonal variation in the stability of the virus, followed by the awareness mechanism, that induces individuals to increase/relax self-protective measures when the number of active cases increases/decreases. The appearance of the Delta variant and the mobility variations have had instead only marginal effects. In absence of vaccines the emerging scenario would have been dramatic with a percentage difference in the number of total infections and total deaths, in both cases, larger than fifty per cent. The model also predicts the appearance of a more contagious variant (the Omicron variant) and its becoming dominant in January 2022."
https://openalex.org/W4284972646,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer type among women worldwide with over a million new cases each year. More than 40% of these women will struggle with chronic pain and fatigue after surgery, regardless of surgical procedure. These consequences are detrimental and result in distress and disability, including work disability. Few attempts have been made to prevent chronic pain and fatigue after surgery by applying a psychological approach, despite psychological risk factors being crucial in the development of both chronic pain and fatigue. In this study, we aim to develop and test an easily implementable strategy of preventing chronic pain and fatigue after breast cancer surgery. The intervention strategy involves a pre-operative hypnosis session and a web-based post-operative Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The hypnosis has previously been found effective in alleviating acute post-operative pain and fatigue in breast cancer patients, while ACT is well suited to cancer populations as it offers a model of healthy adaptation to difficult circumstances. Together they form an intervention strategy with both a preventive and a rehabilitative focus.This randomized controlled trial aims to estimate the effects of the pre- and post- operative interventions compared to attentional control and treatment as usual (TAU) and will also include a qualitative process evaluation. Participants will be randomized to receive either a pre-operative brief hypnosis session and a post-operative web-based psychological intervention (iACT) or a pre-operative one-session mindfulness through an audio file and post-operative TAU. Self-reported questionnaire data and biomarker data will be assessed pre-surgery, post-surgery and 3 and 12 months after surgery. In addition, we will assess registry data on sick leave and prescriptions until 2-year follow-up. In the qualitative process evaluation, data will be collected from participants from both study arms (through interviews and a diary) and two different analyses performed (socio-narrative and Grounded Theory) with the objective to describe the development of chronic post-surgical pain and fatigue and the potential influence of the interventions on these processes. The study is set-up to demonstrate a minimum difference in pain of 1 point on NRS (0-10) and 3 points on FACIT-F (0-52) between the groups at 3-months follow-up by including 200 breast cancer patients in total.This trial will be the first study to estimate the effect of a combined pre-operative hypnosis with a post-operative iACT to prevent pain and fatigue after breast cancer surgery. The results from our study might i) help the large group of women affected by chronic pain and fatigue after breast cancer surgery, ii) shed light on the mechanisms involved in chronic pain and fatigue development, and iii) serve as a model for other surgical procedures.Clinicaltrials.gov, registration number NCT04518085.

https://openalex.org/W4284975898,"HIV self-testing (HIVST) is an innovative HIV testing approach that effectively reaches those who do not otherwise test, including key populations (KPs). Despite potential benefits, HIVST is not currently implemented in Pakistan. The high risk of HIV among transgender (TGs) persons is among the highest risk group for HIV in Pakistan, yet knowledge of HIV status remains low in this key population group. We conducted a pilot project to assess the acceptability and feasibility of distributing HIVST to TGs in Larkana.Eligible participants were 18 years or above and self-identified as transgender (""hijra""). One oral fluid HIVST kit per person was distributed free of cost in the community by trained transgender peer outreach workers (ORW). Participants could request a demonstration of the HIVST procedure before performing self-testing which was provided by the trained ORW. Demographic characteristics of participants were collected. The ORW followed up with phone calls two days later to record if HIVST kits were used, the results, and whether assistance was required.Between November 2020 and February 2021, 150 HIVST kits were distributed to eligible TGs. The average age of participants was 25.5 years (standard deviation: 7.0). Over a third (52, 34.7%) had no formal education, while (16, 10.6%) had attended at least five years of schooling. Over one-third (58, 38.6%) of participants were first-time testers. One hundred and thirty-nine (92.7%) participants reported their results within two days. For the remaining 11 participants, ORWs had to contact them. All participants reported using HIVST kits within three days. A majority (141, 94%) used the kit in their homes, and the remaining nine (6%) used it at the community-based organization's office. Overall, a small proportion (11, 7.3%) of participants requested a demonstration of the test procedure before performing HIVST. Four (2.7%) participants who had performed unsupervised self-tests reported reactive HIVST results; all were linked to treatment within five working days once their HIV result was confirmed. The majority (136, 90.6%) of participants felt that self-testing was easy to perform independently, and 143 (95%) reported that they would recommend HIVST to their peers.HIVST is acceptable among TGs and identified by first-time testers as undiagnosed infections. Peer-led distribution appears to be a feasible approach for implementation in this setting. HIVST should be considered for routine implementation and scale up to reduce testing gaps among Pakistan's key population, particularly TGs."
https://openalex.org/W4284975959,"Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly population. It is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid β and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Increasing evidence shows that the disturbance of insulin signalling in the brain may contribute to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. In type 1 diabetes, these disruptions are caused by hypoinsulinemia, but in type 2 diabetes, they are caused by insulin resistance and decreased insulin secretion. Multiple studies have shown that diabetes is connected with an increased risk of acquiring Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of anti-diabetic agents on Alzheimer's disease progression and the levels of Alzheimer's biomarkers in a hyperglycaemic rat model, which was induced by intraperitoneal injection of streptozocin to produce insulin-deficient diabetes.Thirty-six male Wistar albino rats were allocated into six groups of six rats each. Group I was the negative control group. Intraperitoneal injections of streptozocin (42mg/kg) were used once for the five experimental groups. Group II served as the positive control group. The rats in Groups III, IV, V, and VI received metformin (300mg/kg), donepezil (10mg/kg), insulin glargine (3 unit/animal), and glibenclamide (10mg/kg), respectively, for 21 days.Inducing hyperglycaemia in rats significantly increased the levels of serum glucose, haemoglobin A1c, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, interleukin 6, tumour necrosis factor alpha, amyloid β 42, total plasma tau, and neurofilament light. A significant increase was also found in brain amyloid β 42, nitric oxide, acetylcholinesterase, malondialdehyde, β secretase, and phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau. The greatest statistically significant reductions in serum glucose, haemoglobin A1c, triglycerides, amyloid β 42, total plasma tau, brain amyloid β 42, acetylcholinesterase, and malondialdehyde were observed in rats treated with metformin. In contrast, rats treated with donepezil demonstrated the greatest statistically significant reduction in serum tumour necrosis factor alpha, brain nitric oxide, and β secretase. The levels of neurofilament light and phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau in the brains of rats treated with insulin glargine were significantly lower than the other treatment groups. The total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels in rats treated with glibenclamide exhibited the most statistically significant reductions of all the treatment groups.Metformin and donepezil, when administered at appropriate doses, were shown to successfully lower most plasma and brain biomarkers, including glucose, triglycerides, tumour necrosis factor alpha, amyloid β 42, nitric oxide, acetylcholinesterase, malondialdehyde, and β secretase in rats suffering from Diabetes Mellitus. As a result of this research, we suggest that metformin, either alone or in conjunction with donepezil, might be an excellent drug of choice for neuro-regeneration and risk reduction in Alzheimer's like disease."
https://openalex.org/W4284977968,"Previous research demonstrated a close bidirectional relationship between spatial attention and the manual motor system. However, it is unclear whether an explicit hand movement is necessary for this relationship to appear. A novel method with high temporal resolution-bimanual grip force registration-sheds light on this issue. Participants held two grip force sensors while being presented with lateralized stimuli (exogenous attentional shifts, Experiment 1), left- or right-pointing central arrows (endogenous attentional shifts, Experiment 2), or the words ""left"" or ""right"" (endogenous attentional shifts, Experiment 3). There was an early interaction between the presentation side or arrow direction and grip force: lateralized objects and central arrows led to a larger increase of the ipsilateral force and a smaller increase of the contralateral force. Surprisingly, words led to the opposite pattern: larger force increase in the contralateral hand and smaller force increase in the ipsilateral hand. The effect was stronger and appeared earlier for lateralized objects (60 ms after stimulus presentation) than for arrows (100 ms) or words (250 ms). Thus, processing visuospatial information automatically activates the manual motor system, but the timing and direction of this effect vary depending on the type of stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W4284962658,"Healthcare workers (HCW), who are crucial workforce, have experienced stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. They have been learning to fight against and support patients as much as possible. Thus, this study aims to account for the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreaks on the healthcare workers of medical school hospitals in terms of their perceived stress and coping styles.This cross-sectional study was conducted from June to August, 2021. 517 HCWs self-administered the online survey. Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) in Thai-version was used to examine the perceived stress symptoms. Brief-COPE score was used to determine the coping strategies. Independent sample t-test, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and multivariable regression analysis were utilized. The level of significance was set at p-value < 0.05.The prevalence of perceived stress among the HCWs was 41.97%. Coping strategies were used to deal with stress during the outbreak for problem-solving (Mean ± SD = 0.25 ± 0.60) and positive attitude (Mean ± SD = 2.85 ± 0.62). Significant difference was observed in the use of coping strategies among those who differ in marital status (F2, 514 = 7.234, p-value = 0.001), having children (t515 = -4.175, p-value < 0.001), and days off (t515 = -1.992, p-value = 0.047). Multivariable regression analysis reported who those perceived stress symptoms using social support more than those normal stress (AOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.070-2.236, p-value = 0.02). The perceived stress symptoms group used the avoidance strategy 2.03 times more than the other group (AOR 2.03, 95% CI 1.406-2.934, p-value < 0.001). Interestingly, the participants who perceived stress symptoms applied a positive attitude strategy lesser than those who experienced normal stress (57.5%) (AOR 0.42, 95% CI 0.307-0.590, p-value < 0.001).The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental distress remains. The findings of this study suggest further study to assess the HCWs' stress after the pandemic. HCWs should consider merging each of the coping strategies to balance work and lifestyle in pandemic situations."
https://openalex.org/W4284964446,"Background Despite under-reporting, health workers (HWs) accounted for 2 to 30% of the reported COVID-19 cases worldwide. In line with data from other countries, Jordan recorded multiple case surges among HWs. Methods Based on the standardized WHO UNITY case-control study protocol on assessing risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in HWs, HWs with confirmed COVID-19 were recruited as cases from eight hospitals in Jordan. HWs exposed to COVID-19 patients in the same setting but without infection were recruited as controls. The study lasted approximately two months (from early January to early March 2021). Regression models were used to analyse exposure risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection in HWs; conditional logistic regressions were utilized to estimate odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for the confounding variables. Results A total of 358 (102 cases and 256 controls) participants were included in the analysis. The multivariate analysis showed that being exposed to COVID-19 patients within 1 metre for more than 15 minutes increased three-fold the odds of infection (OR 2.92, 95% CI 1.25–6.86). Following IPC standard precautions when in contact with patients was a significant protective factor. The multivariate analysis showed that suboptimal adherence to hand hygiene increased the odds of infection by three times (OR 3.18; 95% CI 1.25–8.08). Conclusion Study findings confirmed the role of hand hygiene as one of the most cost-effective measures to combat the spreading of viral infections. Future studies based on the same protocol will enable additional interpretations and confirmation of the Jordan experience."
https://openalex.org/W4284967438,"Despite the recognized importance of women's participation in agricultural extension services, research continues to show inequalities in women's participation. Emerging capacities for conducting large-scale extension training using information and communication technologies (ICTs) now afford opportunities for generating the rich datasets needed to analyze situational factors that affect women's participation. Data was recorded from 1,070 video-based agricultural extension training events (131,073 farmers) in four Administrative Divisions of Bangladesh (Rangpur, Dhaka, Khulna, and Rajshahi). The study analyzed the effect of gender of the trainer, time of the day, day of the week, month of the year, Bangladesh Administrative Division, and venue type on (1) the expected number of extension event attendees and (2) the odds of females attending the event conditioned on the total number of attendees. The study revealed strong gender specific training preferences. Several factors that increased total participation, decreased female attendance (e.g., male-led training event held after 3:30 pm in Rangpur). These findings highlight the dilemma faced by extension trainers seeking to maximize attendance at training events while avoiding exacerbating gender inequalities. The study concludes with a discussion of ways to mitigate gender exclusion in extension training by extending data collection processes, incorporating machine learning to understand gender preferences, and applying optimization theory to increase total participation while concurrently improving gender inclusivity."

In such areas, management activities such as increasing water productivity in agricultural sector would be a key step towards sustainable development. Therefore, water resources management to improve the allocation of limited water supplies is essential. In this study, a non-linear programming optimization model have been combined with a AquaCrop model to determine the optimal water and land allocation considering the quality issues of both water and soil resources with focusing on enhancing agriculture water productivity. For this purpose, the spatial variations of chemical and physical properties of soil in the Qazvin plain were taken into account. The soil of study site was divided into three salinity classes, and three weather conditions were identified by Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). Moreover, five irrigation strategies were modeled under each weather condition. To understand the response of major crops under cultivation to water and salinity, the AquaCrop model was calibrated and validated (2005-2020) and utilized in the objective function. Accordingly, the production functions of the different products were obtained, and the cultivation area as well as amount of water consumption of the crops were optimized by using the target functions of maximum net income and maximum water use efficiency. The results showed that the model is capable of simulating crop yield in salinity and water deficit conditions. The coefficient of determination (R2) for barley, wheat and maize was equal to 0.86, 0.92, and 0.96, respectively. Findings reveal that total irrigation water could be reduced by 20% on average without profit reduction when compared to the profit of the present situation. Total economic profit could be increased by 18% on average through the optimization of water allocation and cropping pattern with the same water supply amount as that of the current situation. Also, the water productivity increased between 12 to 30% under these conditions. Therefore, the proposed model can efficiently optimize the amount of irrigation water and cultivation area on a regional scale considering salinity conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4284976367,"Socioeconomic inequalities in the detection and treatment of non-communicable diseases represent a challenge for healthcare systems in middle-income countries (MICs) in the context of population ageing. This challenge is particularly pressing regarding hypertension due to its increasing prevalence among older individuals in MICs, especially among those with lower socioeconomic status (SES). Using comparative data for China, Colombia, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia and South Africa, we systematically assess the association between SES, measured in the form of a wealth index, and hypertension detection and control around the years 2007-15. Furthermore, we determine what observable factors, such as socio-demographic and health characteristics, explain existing SES-related inequalities in hypertension detection and control using a Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition. Results show that the prevalence of undetected hypertension is significantly associated with lower SES. For uncontrolled hypertension, there is evidence of a significant gradient in three of the six countries at the time the data were collected. Differences between rural and urban areas as well as lower and higher educated individuals account for the largest proportion of SES-inequalities in hypertension detection and control at the time. Improved access to primary healthcare in MICs since then may have contributed to a reduction in health inequalities in detection and treatment of hypertension. However, whether this indeed has been the case remains to be investigated."
https://openalex.org/W4284977311,"Shared decision-making (SDM) provides patient-centered care. However, the limited consultation time was the main factor hindering the application. Patient education is crucial in the process of SDM. The use of visual aids as health education materials is an effective way to improve patients' health literacy and medication adherence. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of the clinician-created educational video of acne, accessed by patients during the waiting time, including knowledge level and satisfaction. This study was conducted in dermatology outpatient clinics and collected patient responses through electronic devices. During the waiting time, patients with acne would read educational pamphlets and complete the test first. Then, a clinician-created 8-minute educational video, as a patient decision aid (PDA), was accessed by patients using their own mobile smart devices, followed by a test and questionnaire about the satisfaction of the pamphlet and video. We enrolled 50 patients with acne, including 33 males and 17 females. The mean age is 25.55 ± 6.27 years old, ranging from 15 to 47 years old. About the patients' knowledge, the test score improved significantly after watching the video (P < .001). The same findings were observed in the subgroup analysis of gender and different age groups. A higher proportion of patients preferred the educational video over the pamphlet in both genders and different age groups. All patients agreed with the video helped them to understand the educational information and impressed them more than reading pamphlets. The application of clinician-created educational videos in patient education seems to be an efficient solution to implement SDM in the daily clinical work. Besides, we could remind patients to watch the video anytime when they were not sure about the treatment choices, side effects, or the precautions of medications."

The current study examines the changes required in companies' quality systems to enhance intergenerational learning and knowledge retention. Our primary objective was to understand the factors that influence the development of an organizational culture encouraging innovation, knowledge sharing, organizational learning, openness, and providing opportunities to create up-to-date knowledge. We collected the viewpoints and needs of industry professionals by using interviews and a survey. Then, we analyzed the factors that influence knowledge management quality and transfer between workforce generations. The professionals' primary goal is to introduce, integrate, and improve knowledge in their organization. Their second goal is to facilitate knowledge sharing and transfer between workforce generations. Improving transgenerational knowledge sharing and reducing the loss of knowledge are challenges for all industries. A cutting-edge industry such as the defense field deals with sensitive data, and knowledge management is a strategic need in a competitive context. Quality management standards propose guidelines for developing and enhancing the overall knowledge-related processes. However, implementing them requires a shift in the corporate culture team. Organizational knowledge resilience must be developed by involving the workforce in implementing knowledge management systems."

The relationship between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and physical fitness levels has been analyzed in several studies. However, no studies have synthesized evidence on this relationship throughout adulthood. Moreover, in addition to the overall Mediterranean dietary pattern, the associations of individual components of the Mediterranean diet with physical fitness indicators are also unclear.This protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis for Protocols statement and the Cochrane Collaboration Handbook. Systematic literature searches will be performed in the MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus and Cochrane CENTRAL databases to identify studies published up to 31 January 2022. The inclusion criteria will comprise observational studies and randomized controlled trials reporting the associations between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and physical fitness levels on general healthy or unhealthy adults (≥18 years). When at least five studies addressing the same outcome are available, meta-analysis will be carried out to estimate the standardized mean difference of physical fitness according to the adherence to Mediterranean diet. Subgroup analyses will be performed according to the characteristics of the population, the individual dietary components of the Mediterranean diet and physical fitness parameters as long as there are sufficient studies.This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol is designed for updating evidence on the associations between adherence to overall Mediterranean diet (and specific Mediterranean foods) and physical fitness levels in young, middle-aged, and older adults. Findings from this review may have implications for public health. The results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication, conference presentation, and infographics.

https://openalex.org/W4284961970,"Profiling the adaptive immune repertoire using next generation sequencing (NGS) has become common in human medicine, showing promise in characterizing clonal expansion of B cell clones through analysis of B cell receptors (BCRs) in patients with lymphoid malignancies. In contrast, most work evaluating BCR repertoires in dogs has employed traditional PCR-based approaches analyzing the IGH locus only. The objectives of this study were to: (1) describe a novel NGS protocol to evaluate canine BCRs; (2) develop a bioinformatics pipeline for processing canine BCR sequencing data; and (3) apply these methods to derive insights into BCR repertoires of healthy dogs and dogs undergoing treatment for B-cell lymphoma. RNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy dogs (n = 25) and dogs newly diagnosed with intermediate-to-large B-cell lymphoma (n = 18) with intent to pursue chemotherapy was isolated, converted into cDNA and sequenced by NGS. The BCR repertoires were identified and quantified using a novel analysis pipeline. The IGK repertoires of the healthy dogs were far less diverse compared to IGL which, as with IGH, was highly diverse. Strong biases at key positions within the CDR3 sequence were identified within the healthy dog BCR repertoire. For a subset of the dogs with B-cell lymphoma, clonal expansion of specific IGH sequences pre-treatment and reduction post-treatment was observed. The degree of expansion and reduction correlated with the clinical outcome in this subset. Future studies employing these techniques may improve disease monitoring, provide earlier recognition of disease progression, and ultimately lead to more targeted therapeutics."

https://openalex.org/W4284969872,"Staphylococcus aureus (S . aureus) is one of the earliest pathogens involved in human infections, responsible for a large variety of pathologies. Methicillin was the first antibiotic used to treat infections due to S . aureus but infections due to Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) originated from hospital settings. Later, severe infections due to MRSA without any contact with the hospital environment or health care workers arose. Prevalence of MRSA has shown an alarming increase worldover including Cameroon. This Cross-sectional study was designed to evaluate the occurrence of MRSA infections in five different, most frequented Hospitals in northern Cameroon. Socio demographic data was recorded through questionnaire and different clinical specimens were collected for bacterial isolation. Identification of S . aureus was confirmed via 16s rRNA amplification using S . aureus specific primers. Molecular characterisation was performed through mecA gene, Luk PV gene screening and SCCmec typing. A total of 380 S . aureus clinical isolates were obtained of which 202 (53.2%) were nonduplicate multidrug resistant isolates containing, 45.5% MRSA. Higher number of MRSA was isolated from pus (30.4%) followed by blood culture (18.5%), and urine (17.4%). Patients aged 15 to 30 years presented high prevalence of MRSA (30.4%). Majority isolates (97.8%) carried the m ecA gene, PVL toxin screening indicated 53.3% isolates carried the lukPV gene. Based on PVL detection and clinical history, CA-MRSA represented 53.3% of isolates. SCCmec typing showed that the Type IV was most prevalent (29.3%), followed by type I (23.9%). Amongst MRSA isolates high resistance to penicillin (91.1%), cotrimoxazole (86.7%), tetracycline (72.2%), and ofloxacin (70.0%) was detected. Meanwhile, rifampicin, fusidic acid, lincomycin and minocycline presented high efficacy in bacterial control. This study revealed a high prevalence of MRSA among infections due to S . aureus in Northern Cameroon. All MRSA recorded were multidrug resistant and the prevalence of CA MRSA are subsequently increasing, among population."
https://openalex.org/W4284971398,"Background Psychological distress is a common occurrence among women during the perinatal period. Maternal psychological distress (MPS) can also have a negative influence on neonatal outcomes such as infant health, child development or mother-child interaction. Hence, interventions to improve mental wellbeing during this period are vital. Mindfulness based intervention (MBI) has been found to be effective in reducing psychological distress. Delivery of MBI via the internet, making it accessible and inexpensive, is showing a promising positive effect in reducing psychological distress. A randomized control trial with sufficient power is required to confirm its positive effect among pregnant women. The positive effects of MBI have been found to be associated with heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback; however, the efficacy of MBI on HRV has been rarely studied among pregnant women. Also, the potential association of HRV with MBI and psychological wellbeing needs further examination. This research aims to test the effectiveness of guided mobile-based perinatal mindfulness intervention (GMBPMI) among pregnant women experiencing psychological distress during the pre- and post-natal period, as well as examining the efficacy of GMBPMI on HRV. Method This study is a randomized controlled trial that follows a parallel design. Consenting pregnant women in their second trimester (between 12 th and 20 th week gestation) will be randomly assigned to an intervention group (GMBPMI) or a control group (psychoeducation). The intended sample size is 198, with 99 participants in each group. Three levels of outcomes will be measured at baseline, post intervention in both the intervention and control groups, and at 36-week gestation and five-week postpartum. The primary outcomes include maternal psychological stress, mindfulness and positive appraisal HRV. Secondary outcomes are psychological and physical wellbeing. Tertiary outcomes include obstetric and neonatal outcomes, and social support. Analyses will follow an intention-to-treat method and repeated measures MANOVA will be conducted to compare changes in primary and secondary outcomes. A series of mixed-effects models will be fitted to assess the mediation effects. Discussion This trial expects to increase understanding of GMBPMI on HRV and psychological wellbeing for pregnant women, with extended support in both pre-and post-natal periods. The study could also potentially provide evidence for delivery of cost-effective and accessible services to pregnant women.

https://openalex.org/W4284972518,"Fungal agglutinin-like sequence (Als) cell-surface glycoproteins, best characterized in Candida albicans, mediate adhesive and aggregative interactions with host cells, other microbes, and abiotic surfaces. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for each C. albicans Als protein are valuable reagents for gaining insight into Als protein localization and function. This manuscript describes development and validation of MAbs specific for C. albicans Als2, as well as for C. albicans Als9-1 and Als9-2, two protein variants produced from the ALS9 locus. Native C. albicans ALS9 expression levels were not sufficiently high to produce detectable Als9 protein on the wild-type cell surface so MAb validation required production of overexpression strains, each featuring one of the two ALS9 alleles. An anti-Als2 MAb was raised against an N-glycosylated form of the protein immunogen, as well as an Endoglycosidase H-treated immunogen. The MAb raised against the N-glycosylated immunogen proved superior and immunolabeled C. albicans yeast cells and germ tubes, and the surface of Candida dubliniensis and Candida tropicalis yeasts. Als2 was visible on C. albicans yeast cells recovered from a murine model of oral candidiasis, demonstrating Als2 production both in vivo and in vitro. These new MAbs add to the collection of anti-Als MAbs that are powerful tools to better understand the role of Als proteins in C. albicans biology and pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W4284974144,"Models of consumer choice that assume rational decision processes are too simplistic, as they ignore intuitive processes and combinations of intuition and rationality. In dual process theory, System 1 processes are intuitive, fast, require low cognitive effort, and involve autonomous systems, while System 2 processes are deliberative, slower, reflect greater cognitive effort, and involve controlled attention. The dual process framework facilitates understanding of decision processes that may be diverse and complex. Based on response time as an indicator of System 2 use, we fill gaps in the tourism and choice experiment literatures by i) assessing the dimensionality of a decision style scale and its role in predicting System 2 use and ii) assessing whether researcher interventions, such as instructions, can promote System 2 use. The study is based on survey-based choice experiment responses of 483 domestic and international visitors across two Norwegian nature-based tourism destination contexts. Each visitor completed four choice experiment tasks for a total of 1,932 choice occasions. Results indicated diversity in extent of System 2 use. The decision style scale was multidimensional with both the intuitive and rational subscales predicting response time. We encourage inclusion of decision style scales–and specifically multidimensional scales–in future tourism choice and choice experiment applications. Statistically significant coefficients for instructions and unhurriedness suggest potential for researchers to increase System 2 processing in survey tasks. We encourage future use of this intervention, especially when survey tasks are intended to replicate “real world” decisions that rely heavily on System 2 use."
https://openalex.org/W4284976373,"This study demonstrates the functional importance of the Surround context relayed laterally in V1 by the horizontal connectivity, in controlling the latency and the gain of the cortical response to the feedforward visual drive. We report here four main findings: 1) a centripetal apparent motion sequence results in a shortening of the spiking latency of V1 cells, when the orientation of the local inducer and the global motion axis are both co-aligned with the RF orientation preference; 2) this contextual effects grows with visual flow speed, peaking at 150-250°/s when it matches the propagation speed of horizontal connectivity (0.15-0.25 mm/ms); 3) For this speed range, the axial sensitivity of V1 cells is tilted by 90° to become co-aligned with the orientation preference axis; 4) the strength of modulation by the surround context correlates with the spatiotemporal coherence of the apparent motion flow. Our results suggest an internally-generated binding process, linking local (orientation /position) and global (motion/direction) features as early as V1. This long-range diffusion process constitutes a plausible substrate in V1 of the human psychophysical bias in speed estimation for collinear motion. Since it is demonstrated in the anesthetized cat, this novel form of contextual control of the cortical gain and phase is a built-in property in V1, whose expression does not require behavioral attention and top-down control from higher cortical areas. We propose that horizontal connectivity participates in the propagation of an internal ""prediction"" wave, shaped by visual experience, which links contour co-alignment and global axial motion at an apparent speed in the range of saccade-like eye movements."
https://openalex.org/W4284976660,"Background Whether there is difference in kidney disease risk between chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and resolved HCV infection remains inconclusive. Additionally, the impact of different HCV genotypes on kidney disease risk is relatively unknown. Accordingly, we conducted a population-based cross-sectional study to investigate the association of HCV infection status and genotype on kidney disease risk. Methods The study population were adult participants of 1999–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in the United States. Chronic and resolved infection were defined as HCV seropositivity with and without detectable HCV RNA, respectively. HCV genotypes were classified into genotype 1, genotype 2, and other genotypes. Prevalent estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 or urinary albumin creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g was defined as kidney disease. Results The average age of study population (n = 44,998) was 46.7±17.0 years with 49.8% being males. Compared with individuals without HCV infection (n = 44,157), those with resolved (n = 255) or chronic HCV infection (n = 586) had higher prevalence of kidney disease: 14.8%, 23.5%, and 20.1%, respectively ( p &lt;0.001). After adjusting for potential confounders, we found that both resolved (adjusted OR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.02–1.93) and chronic HCV infection (adjusted OR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.01–1.57) correlated to increased kidney disease risk compared with no HCV infection. Additionally, individuals with HCV genotype 1 (adjusted OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.09–1.82) but not genotype 2 or other genotypes had greater kidney disease risk compared with no HCV infection. Furthermore, we observed that genotype 1 had 2-fold higher kidney disease risk (adjusted OR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.07–4.53) compared with non-genotype 1 HCV infection. Conclusion Both resolved and chronic HCV infection, particularly genotype 1, were associated with higher kidney disease risk."
https://openalex.org/W4284976699,"We investigate the accuracy of intensity-based deformable image registration (DIR) for tumor localization in liver stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT). We included 4DCT scans to capture the breathing motion of eight patients receiving SBRT for liver metastases within a retrospective clinical study. Each patient had three fiducial markers implanted. The liver and the tumor were delineated in the mid-ventilation phase, and their positions in the other phases were estimated with deformable image registration. We tested referenced and sequential registrations strategies. The fiducial markers were the gold standard to evaluate registration accuracy. The registration errors related to measured versus estimated fiducial markers showed a mean value less than 1.6mm. The positions of some fiducial markers appeared not stable on the 4DCT throughout the respiratory phases. Markers' center of mass tends to be a more reliable measurement. Distance errors of tumor location based on registration versus markers center of mass were less than 2mm. There were no statistically significant differences between the reference and the sequential registration, i.e., consistency and errors were comparable to resolution errors. We demonstrated that intensity-based DIR is accurate up to resolution level for locating the tumor in the liver during breathing motion."
https://openalex.org/W4284978009,"The increasing uncertainty of our world raises important questions for university students on how they should respond to the employment challenges caused by changing environments. One of the central topics is the development of graduate employability. However, most previous research on graduate employability was undertaken in a stable environment, limiting our understanding of how graduate employability develops in a dynamic context. We have advanced the literature by introducing action theory to investigate the process of personal initiative affecting graduate employability in a period of environmental uncertainty. Using a time-lagged research design, we collected data from a sample of 229 Chinese university students and tested the hypothesized relationships. We find that personal initiative positively affects graduate employability through human and psychological capital. We further show that environmental uncertainty plays a contingent role in the above processes. Specifically, when a high level of environmental uncertainty is perceived, the positive indirect effect of personal initiative on graduate employability through either human capital or psychological capital is more likely to be strengthened. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4284978290,"Background People with axial Spondyloarthritis (axSpA) suffer from lengthy diagnostic delays of ~7 years. The usage of screening tools to identify axSpA patients in primary care can reduce diagnostic delays by facilitating early referral to rheumatologic care. The purpose of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of a potential screening tool for patients with axSpA. Method Content validity was evaluated by soliciting feedback from 7 rheumatologists regarding the relevance and content representativeness of the proposed screening questions. For the test-retest study, participants ≥18 years of age with chronic back pain (≥3 months) without a diagnosis of mechanical or inflammatory back pain (n = 91) were e-recruited through ResearchMatch. Participation included completing identical baseline and follow-up questionnaires ~14 days apart. Weighted quadratic kappa was used to measure test-retest reliability between the two ratings of the ordinal scales. Construct validity was examined using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and items with factor loadings ≥0.6 were extracted. Scale dimensionality and simplified factorial solutions were measured using Kaiser’s criteria (Eigenvalue &gt;1). Cronbach’s alpha was used to measure internal consistency. Results Most participants were women, non-Hispanic white, and had at least some college education, with a mean age of 45 years. On average, the age at onset of back pain was 31 years. Eleven questions yielded test–retest reliabilities ranging from 0.6 to 0.76. Results from EFA extracted two factors relating to: 1) how pain affects daily life functioning and 2) whether pain improves with movement. Internal consistency was high for questions evaluating how pain affects life, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.81. Following assessment for validity and reliability, the questionnaire was revised to create the 6-item screening tool. Conclusions The 6-item SpA-SED screening tool designed to identify potential cases of axSpA was found to have good test–retest reliability and high internal consistency."

Material and methods 36 patients were non-randomly assigned to autogenous lateral alveolar ridge augmentation with either cortical autogenous bone blocks, or healthy autogenous tooth roots or non-preservable teeth. Mucosal inflammation was assessed by probing pocket depth (PD) at all sampling sites and by bleeding on probing (BOP) in a subset of sampling sites, and standardized biofilm samples were obtained from the submucosal peri-implant sulcus and sulcus of a contralateral tooth at two times (t1 after implant placement; t2 after six months). Seven bacterial species were quantified using Taqman PCR. Results Mucosal inflammation did not differ between augmentation groups, but peri-implant sulci showed increased abundance of M . salivarium after augmentation with autogenous tooth roots lasting for at least six months (t1 p = 0.05, t2 p = 0.011). In M . salivarium- positive samples, Tannerella forsythia was correlated with PD (R = 0.25, p = 0.035) This correlation was not observed in M . salivarium- negative samples. Compared to all other samples, PD was deeper in co-detection (i.e., simultaneous M . salivarium and T . forsythia ) positive samples (p = 0.022). No association of single or co-detection of bacteria with BOP was observed. Conclusion Presence of M . salivarium in peri-implant sulci varies with augmentation method and is associated with increased PD but not BOP. A potential causal role of M . salivarium in inflammation through a mechanism involving co-presence of T . forsythia requires further study."
https://openalex.org/W4284964777,"Most synchronization error correction codes deal with random independent insertion and deletion errors without correlation. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic channel model with correlated insertion and deletion (CID) errors to capture the data dependence applicable to the bit-patterned media recording (BPMR) system. We also investigate the error performance and decoding complexity of a concatenated LDPC-marker code over the CID channel. Furthermore, we modify the forward backward decoding algorithm to make it suitable for the CID channel, and elaborate it based on a two-dimensional state transition diagram. Compared with the conventional marker coding scheme dealing with random errors, the concatenated LDPC-marker code takes into account the dependence between synchronization errors, improves the error performance, and reduces the decoding complexity. The BER performance of the concatenated LDPC-marker code is improved by more than 50% on average, and the decoding time is reduced by nearly 35% when the LDPC code (n = 4521, k = 3552) and the marker code (Nm = 2, Nc = 30) are used over the CID channel."

https://openalex.org/W4284965993,"Understanding the grazing process and animal response to sward structures (e.g., sward height) is key to setting targets for efficient grazing management. We hypothesized that the short-term intake rate (STIR) of dry matter (DM) and digestible organic matter (OM) by dairy heifers is maximized with Kikuyu grass (Cenchrus clandestinus-Hochst. ex Chiov.) of intermediate sward heights. The treatments consisted of five pre-grazing sward heights (10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 cm) randomly assigned to two of ten paddocks. The experimental design included two measurements of each paddock at different periods and times of day. Three Holstein heifers (440 ± 42 kg body weight) were used to determine the STIR, which was estimated using the double-weighing technique with correction for insensible weight losses. The bite mass (BM), bite rate (BR), sward structural characteristics, and nutritional value of herbage samples were assessed. The data were analyzed using mixed models with a factorial arrangement of five sward heights, two times of day, and two evaluation periods. The sward height of Kikuyu grass that maximized both STIRs was approximately 20 cm. The STIR of the DM was 30% and 15% lower than the maximum in the shortest and tallest swards tested, respectively. In swards shorter than 20 cm, the STIR was lower because the BM decreased with sward height, whereas in those greater than 20 cm, the lower BM and STIR of DM was explained by a decrease in bulk density and bite volume. The top stratum was composed mainly of highly digestible leaf blades with similar nutrient content across sward heights; therefore the STIR of digestible OM was also maximized at 20 cm. Hence, the optimal pre-grazing sward height of Kikuyu grass should be managed at 20 cm under rotational stocking systems to maximize nutrient intake rate of dairy heifers."

In addition, there are also certain differences between the expansion patterns of provincial capital cities and non-capital cities; (2) The UB areas of YB has steadily expand from 3,500 km 2 in 2000 to 10,600 km 2 in 2018, amongst which the expansion of provincial capital cities is the most obvious 1919 km 2 ; (3) Interestingly it is also discovered that urban expansion in Qinghai Province, the sourceland of the YB, takes place in a diffuse way, with the shifting of the centre of gravity for four types of total area, net increase in area, rate of growth and intensity of expansion followed a ""northwest to southeast"" tendency of development."
https://openalex.org/W4284966994,"Timor-Leste is one of the world's most malnourished nations where micronutrient-deficient diets are a contributing factor to the prevalence of child stunting, currently estimated to be 45.6% of children under five. Fish are an important source of nutrients and one that may assist the country's predominantly rural population of agriculturalists to exit poverty and malnutrition. However, a small national fishing fleet producing low catch volumes places fish out of reach of most inland and upland populations where it is needed most. Fish consumption is very low in rural, inland areas compared to coastal, regional, and global averages. This study is a one-year, partially masked, cluster-randomized controlled trial among families living in rural, inland Timor-Leste. We aim to test and compare the effects of two treatments, alone and in combination, on the frequency and volume of household fish consumption in rural, inland areas as a proxy for improved dietary diversity and micronutrient intake. Treatment 1 is the installation of nearshore, moored fish aggregating devices (FADs) to improve catch rates with existing fishing gears. Treatment 2 is a social and behaviour change (SBC) activity to promote fish consumption. Villages in inland communities will be randomized to receive treatment 1, treatment 2, both treatments, or neither treatment. Data will be collected at baseline (prior to the rollout of the treatments) and endline. Our study will determine the impact of an improved supply of fish, along with nutrition-oriented SBC activities, on the fish purchasing and consumption practices of rural, inland households. Findings from this study are urgently needed by Small Island Developing States to guide policy and investment decisions on how best to improve households' diets using locally available, nutrient-dense foods such as fish. Investments such as these are needed to break the cycle of malnutrition. This trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04729829).

https://openalex.org/W4284968998,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are neuronal, proton-gated, Na+-selective ion channels. They are involved in various physiological and pathological processes such as neurodegeneration after stroke, pain sensation, fear behavior and learning. To obtain information on the activation mechanism of ASIC1a, we attempted in this study to impose distance constraints between paired residues in different channel domains by using cross-linkers reacting with engineered Cys residues, and we measured how this affected channel function. First, the optical tweezer 4'-Bis(maleimido)azobenzene (BMA) was used, whose conformation changes depending on the wavelength of applied light. After exposure of channel mutants to BMA, an activation of the channel by light was only observed with a mutant containing a Cys mutation in the extracellular pore entry, I428C. Western blot analysis indicated that BMA did not cross-link Cys428 residues. Extracellular application of methanethiosulfonate (MTS) cross-linkers of different lengths changed the properties of several Cys mutants, in many cases likely without cross-linking two Cys residues. Our observations suggest that intersubunit cross-linking occurred in the wrist mutant A425C and intrasubunit cross-linking in the acidic pocket mutant D237C/I312C. In these mutants, exposure to cross-linkers favored a non-conducting channel conformation and induced an acidic shift of the pH dependence and a decrease of the maximal current amplitude. Overall, the cross-linking approaches appeared to be inefficient, possibly due to the geometrical requirements for successful reactions of the two ends of the cross-linking compound."
https://openalex.org/W4284970500,"Cryptosporidium spp. is recognized as an opportunistic zoonotic parasite that infects humans as well as wild and domestic animals. This enteric protozoan is a major cause of diarrhea in humans and animals and often result in death due to severe dehydration. The present study was designed to investigate the prevalence, identification of various risk factors and evaluation of sensitivity of the two diagnostic techniques for rapid and correct detection of Cryptosporidium infection in diarrheic sheep in Pakistan.A total of 360 fecal samples were collected and processed for detection of Cryptosporidium infection after proper preservation. These samples were properly stained with modified Ziehl-Neelsen acid staining and then examined under simple microscope at 100x magnification for confirmation of Cryptosporidium oocysts. The same samples were again processed through simple PCR for confirmation of the Cryptosporidium spp.The age wise prevalence was detected through simple microscopy and PCR. We found highest prevalence at the age of ≤1 year followed by 1-2 years of age while the lowest prevalence was recorded at the age of ≥ 2-3 years of sheep and found significant difference between different ages (P<0.05). The sex wise prevalence showed the highest prevalence in male (♂) animals detected compared to female (♀). The overall prevalence was detected 27.08% and 18.80% through PCR and simple microscopy, respectively, and significant difference between two diagnostic techniques were observed (P<0.05). Considering the seasonality, the highest prevalence was recorded through simple microscopy in autumn, summer, and spring, while the lowest in winter. These results were confirmed through PCR.It was concluded that molecular detection is the most efficient, specific and sensitive technique for detection of Cryptosporidium infection than simple microscopy. Moreover sheep is the major potential source of infection to other wild and domestic animals including humans."
https://openalex.org/W4284971007,"Malpighian tubules, the renal organs of mosquitoes, facilitate the rapid dehydration of blood meals through aquaporin-mediated osmosis. We performed phosphoproteomics analysis of three Malpighian tubule protein-libraries (1000 tubules/sample) from unfed female mosquitoes as well as one and 24 hours after a blood meal. We identified 4663 putative phosphorylation sites in 1955 different proteins. Our exploratory dataset reveals blood meal-induced changes in phosphorylation patterns in many subunits of V-ATPase, proteins of the target of rapamycin signaling pathway, vesicle-mediated protein transport proteins, proteins involved in monocarboxylate transport, and aquaporins. Our phosphoproteomics data suggest the involvement of a variety of new pathways including nutrient-signaling, membrane protein shuttling, and paracellular water flow in the regulation of urine excretion. Our results support a model in which aquaporin channels translocate from intracellular vesicles to the cell membrane of stellate cells and the brush border membrane of principal cells upon blood feeding."
https://openalex.org/W4284971683,"The prevalence and intensity of parasitism can have different fitness costs between sexes, and across species and developmental stages. This variation could arise because of species specific sexual and developmental differences in body condition, immunity, and resistance. Theory predicts that the prevalence of parasitism will be greater in individuals with poor body condition and the intensity of parasitism will be greater in individuals with larger body size. These predictions have been tested and verified in vertebrates. In insects, however, contradictory evidence has been found in different taxa. Here, we tested these predictions on two species of Agriocnemis ( Agriocnemis femina and Agriocnemis pygmaea ) damselflies, which are parasitized by Arrenurus water mite ectoparasites. We measured body weight, total body length, abdomen area and thorax area of non-parasitized damselflies and found body condition varied between males and females, between immature females and mature females and between A . femina and A . pygmaea . Then, we calculated the parasite prevalence, i.e., the absence or presence of parasites and intensity, i.e., the number of parasites per infected damselfly in eleven natural populations of both species. In line to our predictions, we observed greater prevalence in immature females than mature females but found no difference in parasite prevalence between males and females. Furthermore, we found that parasite intensity was higher in females than males and in immature females than mature females. Our result also showed that the frequency and intensity of parasitism varied between the two studied species, being higher in A . pygmaea than A . femina . Our study provides evidence that parasitism impacts sexes, developmental stages and species differentially and suggests that variation may occur due to sex, developmental stage, and species-specific resistance and tolerance mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W4284975433,"A huge, unprecedented demand for gelatin coupled with its implications on global sustainability has resulted in the need to discover novel proteins with gelling attributes for applications in the food industry. Currently used gelation assays require large sample volumes and thus the screening for novel gelling proteins is a formidable technical challenge. In this paper, we report the 'Floating Sphere Assay' which is a simple, economical, and miniaturized assay to detect minimum gelling concentration with volumes as low as 50 μl. Results from the Floating Sphere Assay are consistent with currently used methods for gelation tests and accurately estimate the Minimum Gelling Concentrations (MGCs) of gelatin, κ-carrageenan and gellan gum. The assay was also able to differentiate the strengths of strong and weak gellan gum gels prepared at pH 3.5 and pH 7.0 respectively. The Floating Sphere Assay can be utilized in high-throughput screens for gelling proteins and can accelerate the discovery of gelatin substitutes."
https://openalex.org/W4284975768,"Odontoid process fractures are among the most common in elderly cervical spines. Their treatment often requires fixation, which may include use of implants anteriorly or posteriorly. Bone density can significantly affect the outcomes of these procedures. Currently, little is known about bone mineral density (BMD) distributions within cervical spine in elderly. This study documented BMD distribution across various anatomical regions of elderly cervical vertebrae.Twenty-three human cadaveric C1-C5 spine segments (14 males and 9 female, 74±9.3 y.o.) were imaged via quantitative CT-scan. Using an established experimental protocol, the three-dimensional shapes of the vertebrae were reconstructed from CT images and partitioned in bone regions (4 regions for C1, 14 regions for C2 and 12 regions for C3-5). The BMD was calculated from the Hounsfield units via calibration phantom. For each vertebral level, effects of gender and anatomical bone region on BMD distribution were investigated via pertinent statistical tools. Data trends suggested that BMD was higher in female vertebrae when compared to male ones. In C1, the highest BMD was found in the posterior portion of the bone. In C2, BMD at the dens was the highest, followed by lamina and spinous process, and the posterior aspect of the vertebral body. In C3-5, lateral masses, lamina, and spinous processes were characterized by the largest values of BMD, followed by the posterior vertebral body.The higher BMD values characterizing the posterior aspects of vertebrae suggest that, in the elderly, posterior surgical approaches may offer a better fixation quality."
https://openalex.org/W4284976745,"Multilocus Sequence Typing has become a useful tool for the study of the genetic diversity and population structure of different organisms. In this study, a MLST approach with seven loci ( CP47 , MS5 , MS9 , MSC6-7 , TP14 , and gp60 ) was used to analyze the genetic diversity of Cryptosporidium hominis and Cryptosporidium parvum isolated from 28 Colombian patients. Five Cryptosporidium species were identified: C. hominis , C. parvum , Cryptosporidium felis , Cryptosporidium meleagridis , and Cryptosporidium suis . Unilocus gp60 analysis identified four allelic families for C. hominis (Ia, Ib, Id, and Ie) and two for C. parvum (IIa and IIc). There was polymorphic behavior of all markers evaluated for both C. hominis and C. parvum , particularly with the CP47 , MS5 , and gp60 markers. Phylogenetic analysis with consensus sequences (CS) of the markers showed a taxonomic agreement with the results obtained with the 18S rRNA and gp60 gene. Additionally, two monophyletic clades that clustered the species C. hominis and C. parvum were detected, with a higher number of subclades within the monophyletic groups compared to those with the gp60 gene. Thirteen MLG were identified for C. hominis and eight for C. parvum . Haplotypic and nucleotide diversity were detected, but only the latter was affected by the gp60 exclusion from the CS analysis. The gene fixation index showed an evolutionary closeness between the C. hominis samples and a less evolutionary closeness and greater sequence divergence in the C. parvum samples. Data obtained in this work support the implementation of MLST analysis in the study of the genetic diversity of Cryptosporidium , considering the more detailed information that it provides, which may explain some genetic events that with an unilocus approach could not be established. This is the first multilocus analysis of the intra-specific variability of Cryptosporidium from humans in South America."
https://openalex.org/W4284976746,"The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), a primary pest of soybean, poses a severe threat to soybean production. In this study, the 4th instar nymphs were exposed to the LC50 and LC30 of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam from F0 to F4 generations to evaluate the activities of peroxidase, pyruvate kinase, and trehalase using microassay. We found that peroxidase and pyruvate kinase activities in soybean aphids increased rapidly, first to peak and then decreased slowly generation by generation under imidacloprid and thiamethoxam stress. In contrast, the trehalase activity was significantly decreased in F1 to F5 generations when treated with the LC50 and LC30 and imidacloprid and thiamethoxam compared to control. In addition, the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was used to monitor the changes in molting and juvenile hormone expressions of the soybean aphids in each generation (F1-F5). The expression of juvenile hormone in soybean aphids was increased significantly in each generation under continuous stress of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam LC50 imidacloprid and LC50 thiamethoxam inhibited the expression of molting hormones in soybean aphids of each generation. LC30 imidacloprid or LC30 thiamethoxam significantly stimulated the expression of molting hormone in the 1st and 2nd instar nymphs in each generation. In this paper, the differences in antioxidant regulation, energy metabolism intensity, and hormone expression of multi-generation soybean aphids were monitored under continuous stress of imidacloprid and thiamethoxam. Our results revealed the effects of continuous insecticide stress on the main endogenous substances. Further, they clarified the regulation rules of resistance in soybean aphids, providing a reference for efficient control with imidacloprid and thiamethoxam."
