https://openalex.org/W2963969605,"Community detection algorithms have been widely used to study the organization of complex networks like the brain. These techniques provide a partition of brain regions (or nodes) into clusters (or communities), where nodes within a community are densely interconnected with one another. In their simplest application, community detection algorithms are agnostic to the presence of community hierarchies: clusters embedded within clusters of other clusters. To address this limitation, we exercise a multi-scale extension of a common community detection technique, and we apply the tool to synthetic graphs and to graphs derived from human neuroimaging data, including structural and functional imaging data. Our multi-scale community detection algorithm links a graph to copies of itself across neighboring topological scales, thereby becoming sensitive to conserved community organization across levels of the hierarchy. We demonstrate that this method is sensitive to topological inhomogeneities of the graph’s hierarchy by providing a local measure of community stability and inter-scale reliability across topological scales. We compare the brain’s structural and functional network architectures, and we demonstrate that structural graphs display a more prominent hierarchical community organization than functional graphs. Finally, we build an explicitly multimodal multiplex graph that combines both structural and functional connectivity in a single model, and we identify the topological scales where resting state functional connectivity and underlying structural connectivity show similar versus unique hierarchical community architecture. Together, our results demonstrate the advantages of the multi-scale community detection algorithm in studying hierarchical community structure in brain graphs, and they illustrate its utility in modeling multimodal neuroimaging data."
https://openalex.org/W2940673168,"Managing forests to preserve biodiversity requires a good knowledge not only of the factors driving its dynamics but also of the structural elements that actually support biodiversity. Tree-related microhabitats (e.g. cavities, cracks, conks of fungi) are tree-borne features that are reputed to support specific biodiversity for at least a part of species’ life cycles. While several studies have analysed the drivers of microhabitats number and occurrence at the tree scale, they remain limited to a few tree species located in relatively narrow biogeographical ranges. We used a nationwide database of forest reserves where microhabitats were inventoried on more than 22,000 trees. We analysed the effect of tree diameter and living status (alive or dead) on microhabitat number and occurrence per tree, taking into account biogeoclimatic variables and tree genus. We confirmed that larger trees and dead trees bore more microhabitats than their smaller or living counterparts did; we extended these results to a wider range of tree genera and ecological conditions than those studied before. Contrary to our expectations, the total number of microhabitat types per tree barely varied with tree genus–though we did find slightly higher accumulation levels for broadleaves than for conifers–nor did it vary with elevation or soil pH, whatever the living status. We observed the same results for the occurrence of individual microhabitat types. However, accumulation levels with diameter and occurrence on dead trees were higher for microhabitats linked with wood decay processes (e.g. dead branches or woodpecker feeding holes) than for other, epixylic, microhabitats such as epiphytes (ivy, mosses and lichens). Promoting large living and dead trees of several tree species may be a relevant, and nearly universal, way to favour microhabitats and enhance the substrates needed to support specific biodiversity. In the future, a better understanding of microhabitat drivers and dynamics at the tree scale may help to better define their role as biodiversity indicators for large-scale monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2944095947,"Since 1959 with the proposal of Double Agar Layer (DAL) method for phage detection and quantification, many sophisticated methods have emerged meanwhile. However, many of them are either too complex/expensive or insensitive to replace routine utilization of DAL method in clinical, environmental and industrial environments. For that purpose, we have explored an alternative method for the detection and quantification of bacteriophages that fulfills the criteria of being rapid, simple and inexpensive. In this paper we have developed a method based on the analysis of optical density kinetics in bacterial cultures exposed to phage-containing samples. Although the decrease in optical density caused by cell lysis was one of the first observable consequences of the effect of viral infection in bacterial cultures, the potential of the method for the assessment of phage abundance has never been fully exploited. In this work we carry out a detailed study of optical density kinetics in phage-infected bacterial cultures, as a function of both, phage abundance and initial concentration of the host organisms. In total, 90 different combinations of bacteria/phage concentrations have been used. The data obtained provide valuable information about sensitivity ranges, duration of the assay, percentages of inhibition and type of lysing behavior for each phage concentration. The method described can detect, as few as 10 phage particles per assay volume after a phage incubation period of 3.5h. The duration of the assay can be shortened to 45min at the expense of losing sensitivity and increasing the limit of detection to 108 pfu/ml. Despite using non-sophisticated technology, the method described has shown sensitivity and response time comparable to other high-end methods. The simplicity of the technology and of the analytical steps involved, make the system susceptible of miniaturization and automation for high-throughput applications which can be implemented in routine analysis in many environments."
https://openalex.org/W2944469918,"This paper proposes a new quantum-like method for the binary classification applied to classical datasets. Inspired by the quantum Helstrom measurement, this innovative approach has enabled us to define a new classifier, called Helstrom Quantum Centroid (HQC). This binary classifier (inspired by the concept of distinguishability between quantum states) acts on density matrices—called density patterns—that are the quantum encoding of classical patterns of a dataset. In this paper we compare the performance of HQC with respect to twelve standard (linear and non-linear) classifiers over fourteen different datasets. The experimental results show that HQC outperforms the other classifiers when compared to the Balanced Accuracy and other statistical measures. Finally, we show that the performance of our classifier is positively correlated to the increase in the number of “quantum copies” of a pattern and the resulting tensor product thereof."
https://openalex.org/W2944773334,"Evidence suggests that suicide rates can increase following the suicide of a prominent celebrity or peer, sometimes known as 'suicide contagion'. The risk of contagion is especially high when media coverage is detailed and sensational. A recent study reported a 10% increase in U.S. suicides in the months following the suicide of comedian Robin Williams, who died in August 2014. The authors tentatively linked this increase to sensational media coverage; however, no content analysis of U.S. media was performed. As such, the aim of the present study is to formally examine the tone and content of U.S. newspaper coverage of Williams' suicide. The primary objective is to assess adherence to suicide reporting guidelines in U.S. newspapers after his suicide. The secondary objective is to identify common emerging themes discussed in these articles. The tertiary objective is to compare patterns of results in the U.S media with those in the Canadian media. Articles about Williams' suicide were collected from 10 U.S. newspapers in the 30-day period following his death using systematic retrieval software, which were then examined for adherence to suicide reporting recommendations. An inductive thematic analysis was also undertaken. A total of 63 articles were included in the study. We found that 100% of articles did not call it a 'successful' suicide, 96.8% did not use pejorative phrases and 71% did not say 'commit' suicide. However, only 11% included information about help-seeking, 27% tended to romanticize his suicide and 46% went into detail about the method. The most prominent emerging theme was Williams' struggles with mental illness and addiction. These findings suggest that U.S. newspapers moderately adhered to best practice recommendations when reporting Williams' suicide. Key recommendations were underapplied, which may have contributed to suicide contagion. New interventions targeting U.S. journalists and media may be needed to improve suicide reporting."
https://openalex.org/W2944401579,"Life stress is a key determinant of poor mental and physical health, but until recently no instrument existed for efficiently assessing cumulative stress exposure and severity across the entire lifespan. The Stress and Adversity Inventory (STRAIN) is an online, interview-based stress assessment system that was developed to address this need. We examined the concurrent, predictive, and discriminant validity of a German translation of the STRAIN by administering the instrument, along with several other measures of stress and health, to 298 adults (81 men, 217 women, Mage = 30.3 years). The German STRAIN demonstrated excellent concurrent validity, as evidenced by associations with other instruments assessing early adversity (|rs|≥.62, ps≤.001). It also correlated with instruments assessing recent life event exposure in adulthood (|rs|≥.48, ps≤.001), as well as recent perceived stress (|rs|≥ .25, ps≤.001) and recent chronic stress levels (|rs|≥ .19, ps≤.001). Additionally, the German STRAIN showed strong predictive validity in relation to anxiety symptoms (|rs|≥ .22, ps≤.001) and depressive symptoms (|rs|≥ .33, ps≤.001). Finally, the German STRAIN showed good discriminant validity, with lifetime stressor count being unrelated to personality features like neuroticism. These results demonstrate that the German version of the STRAIN is a valid tool for assessing lifetime stress exposure and severity. Additional research is needed to examine how the German STRAIN predicts psychological and biological stress reactivity and physical health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2944445813,"Background Patients with HIV infection suffer from accelerated aging. In this context, frailty could be a relevant problem that aggravates the quality of life (QoL) and morbi-mortality of these patients. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of frailty and pre-frailty in HIV-infected patients in our cohort as well as their risk factors and QoL. Methods This was a prospective cross-sectional study of HIV-infected people aged ≥18 years on a stable antiretroviral regimen (ART) ≥1 year. Frailty was defined by ≥3 of 5 Fried's criteria: weight loss, low physical activity, exhaustion, weak grip strength and slow walking time. Variables related to sociodemographics, HIV infection, comorbidities, polypharmacy, and QoL were evaluated. Independent predictors of frailty were evaluated using collinearity in a multivariate logistic regression analyses (backward stepwise elimination). Results The 248 people studied has a mean age of 49 years, 63.7% were male, and 81% were Caucasian. The prevalence of pre-frailty and fragility was 39.1% and 4.4%, respectively. The main route of HIV acquisition was heterosexual (47.2%). At the inclusion time 26.6% of the patients had AIDS events, 60.9% were anti-HCV negative, and 91.5% had HIV RNA <50 copies/mL (84.3% for ≥1 year); 10.9% had >2 comorbidities, and 13.3% were receiving >5 non-HIV drugs. Frailty patients had a higher age (p 0.006), more sensitive deficits (visual or auditory) (p 0.002), a greater number of falls during the previous year (p 0.0001), a higher Charlson comorbidity index (p 0.001), and a higher VACS index (p 0.001). All comorbidities, excluding bone and liver, were significantly more frequent in fragile patients. The presence of >2 comorbidities and treatment with >5 drugs not related to HIV they were also more frequent in frail patienst (p 0.0001 and p 0.004, respectively). Independent predictors of pre-frailty/frailty in the multivariable analysis differ in men (VACS index, C-reactive protein [CRP], and falls) and women (CRP, AIDS, and menopause). Patients with pre-frailty/frailty had some indicator of a lower QoL. Conclusion Factors associated with pre-frailty/frailty in HIV-infected patients differ by gender, which should be considered when establishing measures for prevention. The role of menopause in the risk of pre-frailty/frailty warrants further investigations."
https://openalex.org/W2944317454,"Objective The study was conducted to determine the epidemiology and clinical profile of individuals with cleft lip and/or palate (CLP) utilizing specialized academic treatment centres in South Africa’s public health sector. Materials and methods The Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg provided ethical approval for the study. We conducted a retrospective record review of all cases of CLP treated at the specialised academic centres for the two-year period from 1 January 2013 until 31 December 2014. We used a structured, pre-tested record review form to obtain demographic, clinical and treatment information on each CLP case. We used Stata 13 to analyse the data and conducted statistical tests at 5% significance level. Results We analysed 699 records of individuals with CLP. The estimated prevalence of CLP in the South African public health sector was 0.3 per 1000 live births, with provincial variation of 0.1/1000 to 1.2/1000. The distribution of clefts was: 35.3% cleft palate; 34.6% cleft lip and palate; 19.0% cleft lip and other cleft anomalies at 2%. Of the total number of CLP, 47.5% were male and 52.5% female, and this difference was statistically significant (p<0.001). The majority of clefts occurred on the left for males (35.5%) and palate for females (43.4%), with a male predominance of unilateral cleft lip and palate (53.3%). Conclusion The study findings should inform the implementation of South Africa’s planned birth defect surveillance system and health service planning for individuals with CLP."
https://openalex.org/W2943954153,"Objective To identify the causes and categories of stillbirth using the Application of ICD-10 to Deaths during the Perinatal Period (ICD-PM). Methods Prospective, observational study in 12 hospitals across Kenya, Malawi, Sierra Leone and Zimbabwe. Healthcare providers (HCPs) assigned cause of stillbirth following perinatal death audit. Cause of death was classified using the ICD-PM classification system. Findings 1267 stillbirths met the inclusion criteria. The stillbirth rate (per 1000 births) was 20.3 in Malawi (95% CI: 15.0–42.8), 34.7 in Zimbabwe (95% CI: 31.8–39.2), 38.8 in Kenya (95% CI: 33.9–43.3) and 118.1 in Sierra Leone (95% CI: 115.0–121.2). Of the included cases, 532 (42.0%) were antepartum deaths, 643 (50.7%) were intrapartum deaths and 92 cases (7.3%) could not be categorised by time of death. Overall, only 16% of stillbirths could be classified by fetal cause of death. Infection (A2 category) was the most commonly identified cause for antepartum stillbirths (8.6%). Acute intrapartum events (I3) accounted for the largest proportion of intrapartum deaths (31.3%). In contrast, for 76% of stillbirths, an associated maternal condition could be identified. The M1 category (complications of placenta, cord and membranes) was the most common category assigned for antepartum deaths (31.1%), while complications of labour and delivery (M3) accounted for the highest proportion of intrapartum deaths (38.4%). Overall, the proportion of cases for which no fetal or maternal cause could be identified was 32.6% for antepartum deaths, 8.1% for intrapartum deaths and 17.4% for cases with unknown time of death. Conclusion Clinical care and documentation of this care require strengthening. Diagnostic protocols and guidelines should be introduced more widely to obtain better data on cause of death, especially antepartum stillbirths. Revision of ICD-PM should consider an additional category to help accommodate stillbirths with unknown time of death."
https://openalex.org/W2944038265,"Background Perioperative infections, particularly surgical site infections pose significant morbidity and mortality. Phagocytosis is a critical step for microbial eradication. We examined the effect of commonly used anesthetics on macrophage phagocytosis and its mechanism. Methods The effect of anesthetics (isoflurane, sevoflurane, propofol) on macrophage phagocytosis was tested using RAW264.7 mouse cells, mouse peritoneal macrophages, and THP-1 human cells. Either opsonized sheep erythrocytes or fluorescent labeled Escherichia coli were used as phagocytic objects. The activation of Rap1, a critical protein in phagocytosis was assessed using the active Rap1 pull-down and detection kit. To examine anesthetic binding site(s) on Rap1, photolabeling experiments were performed using azi-isoflurane and azi-sevoflurane. The alanine scanning mutagenesis of Rap1 was performed to assess the role of anesthetic binding site in Rap1 activation and phagocytosis. Results Macrophage phagocytosis was significantly attenuated by the exposure of isoflurane (50% reduction by 1% isoflurane) and sevoflurane (50% reduction by 1.5% sevoflurane), but not by propofol. Photolabeling experiments showed that sevoflurane directly bound to Rap1. Mutagenesis analysis demonstrated that the sevoflurane binding site affected Rap1 activation and macrophage phagocytosis. Conclusions We showed that isoflurane and sevoflurane attenuated macrophage phagocytosis, but propofol did not. Our study showed for the first time that sevoflurane served as a novel small GTPase Rap1 inhibitor. The finding will further enrich our understanding of yet-to-be determined mechanism of volatile anesthetics and their off-target effects. The sevoflurane binding site was located outside the known Rap1 functional sites, indicating the discovery of a new functional site on Rap1 and this site would serve as a pocket for the development of novel Rap1 inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2944459188,"In this report, using NMR and molecular modeling, we have studied the structure of lysozyme-S100A6 complex and the influence of tranilast [N-(3, 4-dimethoxycinnamoyl) anthranilic acid], an antiallergic drug which binds to lysozyme, on lysozyme-S100A6 and S100A6-RAGE complex formation and, finally, on cell proliferation. We have found that tranilast may block the S100A6-lysozyme interaction and enhance binding of S100A6 to RAGE. Using WST1 assay, we have found that lysozyme, most probably by blocking the interaction between S100A6 and RAGE, inhibits cell proliferation while tranilast may reverse this effect by binding to lysozyme. In conclusion, studies presented in this work, describing the protein-protein/-drug interactions, are of great importance for designing new therapies to treat diseases associated with cell proliferation such as cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2944462128,"Tear film breakup time (TFBUT) is an essential parameter used to diagnose dry eye disease (DED). However, a robust method for examining TFBUT in murine models has yet to be established. We invented an innovative device, namely, the ""Smart Eye Camera"", which addresses several problems associated with existing methods and is capable of evaluating TFBUT in a murine DED model. We compared images taken by existing devices and the Smart Eye Camera in a graft-versus-host disease-related DED murine model. We observed that the quality of the images obtained by the Smart Eye Camera were sufficient for practical use. Moreover, this new technique could be used to obtain measurements for several consecutive ocular phenotypes in a variety of environments. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our new invention in the examination of ocular phenotypes, including TFBUT in a murine model. We highlight the potential for future translational studies adopting the Smart Eye Camera in clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W2943888888,"Sertoli cell-only (SCO) syndrome is a severe form of human male infertility seemingly characterized by the lack all spermatogenic cells. However, tubules of some SCO testes contain small patches of active spermatogenesis and thus spermatogonial stem cells. We hypothesized that these stem cells cannot replicate and seed spermatogenesis in barren areas of tubule because as-of-yet unrecognized deficits in Sertoli cell gene expression disable most stem cell niches. Performing the first thorough comparison of the transcriptomes of human testes exhibiting complete spermatogenesis with the transcriptomes of testes with SCO syndrome, we defined transcripts that are both predominantly expressed by Sertoli cells and expressed at aberrant levels in SCO testes. Some of these transcripts encode proteins required for the proper assembly of adherent and gap junctions at sites of contact with other cells, including spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). Other transcripts encode GDNF, FGF8 and BMP4, known regulators of mouse SSCs. Thus, most SCO Sertoli cells can neither organize junctions at normal sites of cell-cell contact nor stimulate SSCs with adequate levels of growth factors. We propose that the critical deficits in Sertoli cell gene expression we have identified contribute to the inability of spermatogonial stem cells within small patches of spermatogenesis in some SCO testes to seed spermatogenesis to adjacent areas of tubule that are barren of spermatogenesis. Furthermore, we predict that one or more of these deficits in gene expression are primary causes of human SCO syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2944282970,"The atypical antipsychotic agent, clozapine, is used to treat a variety of neurological disorders including schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease and readily crosses the blood brain barrier to interact with a wide range of neuroreceptors including those for dopamine and serotonin. Recent work has shown that clozapine can reduce neuroinflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a neuroinflammatory model of multiple sclerosis (MS) and mediates its effects in the central nervous system. To further characterise the protection provided by clozapine, the cuprizone model of demyelination was used to assess the effect of clozapine treatment on the cellular events surrounding demyelination and remyelination. Using this model of non-immune demyelination, we found that clozapine administration was unable to prevent demyelination, but when administered post demyelination, was able to enhance the rate of functional recovery. The more rapid improvement of clozapine-treated mice correlated with a decreased level of astrocyte and microglial activation but only modestly enhanced remyelination. Together, these studies highlight the potential of clozapine to support enhanced functional recovery after demyelination, such as that occurring during MS."
https://openalex.org/W2944345128,"Although a growing body of literature demonstrates negative effects of internalized weight bias (IWB), the relationships between IWB and relevant social, psychological, and behavioral variables have not yet been evaluated systematically. The purpose of the present study was to create and assess a model of hypothesized risks and outcomes of IWB. In an online survey, 650 adult males and females completed self-report measures of IWB, self-esteem, weight-related stigma experiences, body-related shame, body satisfaction, societal influence on body image, appearance comparisons, binge eating, distress, and weight-related quality of life. The originally hypothesized model did not provide an adequate fit to the data. Iterative modifications were undertaken, and the resulting model, in which social factors were associated with IWB and body image-related constructs which were in turn associated with psychological and behavioral outcomes, provided excellent fit to the data (CFI > .99, SRMR = .02, and RMSEA = .03). Most model paths were similar for underweight or normal weight participants versus participants with overweight or obesity. This study represents an initial effort at constructing a comprehensive model of IWB that can be further refined in future research and used to help guide the development of related interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2944419271,"The development of point-of-care (POC) diagnostic systems has received well-deserved attention in recent years in the scientific literature, and many experimental systems show great promise in real settings. However, in the case of an epidemic emergency (or a natural disaster), the first line of response should be based on commercially available and validated resources. Here, we compare the performance and ease of use of the miniPCR, a recently commercially available compact and portable PCR device, and a conventional thermocycler for the diagnostics of viral nucleic acids. We used both thermocyclers to detect and amplify Ebola and Zika DNA sequences of different lengths (in the range of 91 to 300 nucleotides) at different concentrations (in the range of ~50 to 4.0 x 108 DNA copies). Our results suggest that the performance of both thermocyclers is quite similar. Moreover, the portability, ease of use, and reproducibility of the miniPCR makes it a reliable alternative for point-of-care nucleic acid detection and amplification."
https://openalex.org/W2944314466,"Over the last two decades, camera traps have revolutionised the ability of biologists to undertake faunal surveys and estimate population densities, although identifying individuals of species with subtle markings remains challenging. We conducted a two-year camera-trapping study as part of a long-term study of urban foxes: our objectives were to determine whether red foxes could be identified individually from camera-trap photos, and highlight camera-trapping protocols and techniques to facilitate photo identification of species with few or subtle natural markings. We collected circa 800,000 camera-trap photos over 4945 camera days in suburban gardens in the city of Bristol, UK: 152,134 (19%) included foxes, of which 13,888 (9%) contained more than one fox. These provided 174,063 timestamped capture records of individual foxes; 170,923 were of foxes ≥ 3 months old. Younger foxes were excluded because they have few distinguishing features. We identified the individual (192 different foxes: 110 males, 49 females, 33 of unknown sex) in 168,417 (99%) of these capture records; the remainder could not be identified due to poor image quality or because key identifying feature(s) were not visible. We show that carefully designed survey techniques facilitate individual identification of subtly-marked species. Accuracy is enhanced by camera-trapping techniques that yield large numbers of high resolution, colour images from multiple angles taken under varying environmental conditions. While identifying foxes manually was labour-intensive, currently available automated identification systems are unlikely to achieve the same levels of accuracy, especially since different features were used to identify each fox, the features were often inconspicuous, and their appearance varied with environmental conditions. We discuss how studies based on low numbers of photos, or which fail to identify the individual in a significant proportion of photos, risk losing important biological information, and may come to erroneous conclusions."
https://openalex.org/W2944433872,"Introduction Using factor analysis, several studies reported that higher-order cognitive control involves separable executive functions. However, the number and definition of the purported functions differed between studies. One possible explanation for this discrepancy is that executive functions don’t exhibit a clear factorial structure, i.e., there is no clear dichotomy between executive function tests which are well-correlated (representing a common factor) and those which are poorly correlated (representing distinct factors). We scrutinize this explanation separately in data from young and from older persons. Methods & results Young and older volunteers completed cognitive tests of the purported executive functions shifting, updating, inhibition and dual-tasking (two tests per function). Confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses yielded, for either age group, factorial structures that were within the range reported in literature. More importantly, when correlations between tests were sorted in ascending order, and were then fitted them by piecewise linear regression with a breakpoint, there was no evidence for a distinct breakpoint between low and high correlations in either age group. Correlations between tests were significantly higher in older compared to young participants, and the pattern of test pairs with high and with low correlations differed between age groups. Discussion The absence of a breakpoint indicates that executive function tests don’t segregate into well-correlated and poorly correlated pairs, and therefore are not well suited for factor analyses. We suggest that executive functions are better described as a partly overlapping rather than a factorial structure. The increase of correlations in older participants supports the existence of age-related dedifferentiation, and the dissimilarity of correlations in the two age groups supports the existence of age-related reorganization."
https://openalex.org/W2944697194,"Statins exert pleiotropic and beneficial anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. We have previously reported that macrophages treated with statins increased the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an inducible anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective stress protein, responsible for the degradation of heme. In the present study, we investigated the effects of atorvastatin on inflammation in mice and analyzed its mechanism of action in vivo. Air pouches were established in 8 week-old female C57BL/6J mice. Atorvastatin (5 mg/kg, i.p.) and/or tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPPIX), a heme oxygenase inhibitor (12 mg/kg, i.p.), were administered for 10 days. Zymosan, a cell wall component of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was injected in the air pouch to trigger inflammation. Cell number and levels of inflammatory markers were determined in exudates collected from the pouch 24 hours post zymosan injection by flow cytometry, ELISA and quantitative PCR. Analysis of the mice treated with atorvastatin alone displayed increased expression of HO-1, arginase-1, C-type lectin domain containing 7A, and mannose receptor C-type 1 in the cells of the exudate of the air pouch. Flow cytometry analysis revealed an increase in monocyte/macrophage cells expressing HO-1 and in leukocytes expressing MRC-1 in response to atorvastatin. Mice treated with atorvastatin showed a significant reduction in cell influx in response to zymosan, and in the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as interleukin-1α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and prostaglandin E2. Co-treatment of mice with atorvastatin and tin protoporphyrin IX (SnPPIX), an inhibitor of heme oxygenase, reversed the inhibitory effect of statin on cell influx and proinflammatory markers, suggesting a protective role of HO-1. Flow cytometry analysis of air pouch cell contents revealed prevalence of neutrophils and to a lesser extent of monocytes/macrophages with no significant effect of atorvastatin treatment on the modification of their relative proportion. These findings identify HO-1 as a target for the therapeutic actions of atorvastatin and highlight its potential role as an in vivo anti-inflammatory agent."
https://openalex.org/W2943959383,"Cortical thickness and gyrification abnormalities in anorexia nervosa (AN) have been recently described, but no attempt has been made to explore their organizational patterns to characterize the neurobiology of the disorder in the different stages of its course. The aim of this study was to explore cortical thickness and gyrification patterns by means of graph theory tools in 38 patients with AN, 20 fully recovered patients, and 38 healthy women (HC). All participants underwent high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Connectome properties were compared between: 1) AN patients and HC, 2) fully recovered patients and HC, 3) patients with a full remission at a 3-year follow-up assessment and patients who had not recovered. Small-worldness was greater in patients with acute AN in comparison to HC in both cortical thickness and gyrification networks. In the cortical thickness network, patients with AN also showed increased Local Efficiency, Modularity and Clustering coefficients, whereas integration measures were lower in the same group. Patients with a poor outcome showed higher segregation measures and lower small-worldness in the gyrification network, but no differences emerged for the cortical thickness network. For both cortical thickness and gyrification patterns, regional analyses revealed differences between patients with different outcomes. Different patterns between cortical thickness and gyrification networks are probably due to their peculiar developmental trajectories and sensitivity to environmental influences. The role of gyrification network alterations in predicting the outcome suggests a role of early maturational processes in the prognosis of AN."
https://openalex.org/W2944448645,"Objectives Human papillomavirus-related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPV+ OPSCC) is increasing in incidence. Although HPV+ OPSCC has favorable prognosis, 10 to 25% of HPV+ OPSCCs eventually recur. We sought to evaluate the feasibility of detection of HPV16 E6/E7 expression in Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) and its utility as a prognostic tool in HPV16-associated OPSCC. Materials and methods We developed a highly sensitive RT-qPCR assay for HPV mRNA expression in EpCAM(+) CTCs. In 22 patients with early stage and locally advanced OPSCC we evaluated HPV16 E6/E7 expression in the EpCAM(+) CTC fraction at baseline and at the end of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. HPV status in pre-therapy formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor biopsies was assessed by p16 immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and double positives were subjected to Real-time qPCR assay for detection of HPV16, 18 and 31 types. Results Fourteen of 22 OPSCC (63.6%) were HPV DNA+/p16+. Among HPV+/p16+ patients, 10 patients (71.4%) were HPV16 DNA+. HPV16 E6/E7(+) CTCs were detected in 3 of 10 patients (30%) at baseline and 4 of 9 patients (44.4%) at the end-of-treatment, all of which were p16+/HPV16 DNA+. Survival analysis showed a significantly higher risk for disease relapse (p = 0.001) and death (p = 0.005) in patients with HPV16 E6/E7(+) baseline CTCs. Conclusion Detection of HPV E6/E7(+) CTCs might be a useful noninvasive test in liquid biopsy samples for determination of a clinically relevant HPV infection in HPV+ OPSCC. Combined interpretation of HPV E6/E7(+) CTCs with UICC staging data may lead to alteration of risk definition of patient subsets, with improved risk discrimination in early-stage disease."

However, genetic control of graft compatibility and relationship between these traits are unknown. Here, we analyzed its inheritance in an F1 apricot progeny from a cross between self- and graft- incompatible and self- and graft-compatible cultivars. Hybrid individuals were genotyped for establishing self-incompatibility status and grafted on the plum rootstock ‘Marianna 2624’. Phenotyping of graft incompatibility was done at two time points, one month and one year after grafting. Anatomical (necrotic layer, bark and wood discontinuity for two consecutive years) and cytomorphological (cell proliferation, cell arrangement and cell shape one month after grafting) characteristics related to graft compatibility displayed continuous variation within the progeny, suggesting a polygenic inheritance. Using the Pearson correlation test, strong and significant correlations were detected between anatomical and cytomorphological traits that may reduce the number of characters for screening genotypes or progenies for graft compatibility in segregating crosses. Furthermore, no correlation existed between self- and graft incompatibility traits suggesting that they are independent inheritance traits. Hence, screening an extended hybrid population is required for pyramiding these traits in breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2944214934,"The use of hydrogels in load bearing applications is often limited by insufficient toughness. 2-Hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) based hydrogels are appealing for translational work, as they are affordable and the use of HEMA is FDA approved. Furthermore, HEMA is photopolymerizable, providing spatiotemporal control over mechanical properties. We evaluated the ability of vinyl methacrylate (VM), allyl methacrylate (AM), and 3-(Acryloyloxy)-2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate (AHPM) to tune hydrogel toughness and Young's modulus. The crosslinkers were selected due to their heterobifunctionality (vinyl and methacrylate) and similar size and structure to EGDMA, which was shown previously to increase toughness as compared to longer crosslinkers. Vinyl methacrylate incorporation into HEMA hydrogels gave rise to hydrogels with Young's moduli spanning ranges for ligament to cartilage, with a peak toughness of 519 ± 70 kJ/m3 under physiological conditions. We report toughness (work of extension) as a function of modulus and equilibrium water content for all formulations. The hydrogels exhibited 80%-100% cell viability, which suggests they could be used in tissue engineering applications."

HSV-1 seropositivity was derived from immunoglobulin G measurements and frequent oro-labial HSV reactivation was self-reported. We carried out two cross-sectional studies using logistic regression to investigate childhood social and environmental conditions as risk factors for HSV-1 seropositivity and comorbidities as risk factors for apparent HSV oro-labial reactivation.Of 9,929 participants, 6310 (63.6%) were HSV-1 IgG positive, and 870 (of 4,934 seropositive participants with reactivation data) experienced frequent oro-labial reactivation. Being born outside the UK/Ireland, contemporaneous urban living and having ≥4 siblings were risk factors for HSV-1 seropositivity. Ever diagnosed with kidney disease, but no other comorbidities, was associated with an increased risk of frequent HSV reactivation (adjOR 1.87, 95%CI: 1.02-3.40).Apparent HSV-1 seropositivity and clinical reactivation are common within an ageing UK population. HSV-1 seropositivity is socially patterned while risk factors for oro-labial HSV reactivation are less clear. Further large studies of risk factors are needed to inform HSV-1 control strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2944306902,"Background Hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection in HIV-infected individuals increases the risk of hepatic complications and mortality. Further, the risk of perinatal HBV transmission increases among HBV/HIV co-infected pregnant women. Although HBV is endemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo, there is little data on HBV/HIV co-infection. We aimed to assess the burden and risk factors of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity among HIV-infected pregnant and post-partum women. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted as part of an ongoing trial to assess the effect of data-driven continuous quality improvement interventions (CQI) for optimal prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV (CQI-PMTCT study, NCT03048669). In each of the 35 health zones of Kinshasa province, all HIV-infected pregnant or breastfeeding women (≤1 year post-delivery) presenting for care in one of the three busiest maternal and child health clinics of the health zone were tested for HBsAg using Alere Determine, Japan. We used logistic regression with general estimating equation accounting for within-clinic clustering to assess risk factors of HBsAg positivity. Results Between November 2016 and June 2018, a total of 1377 women, all on antiretroviral therapy, were tested for HBsAg. Overall, 4.7% [95% binomial confidence interval (CI): 3.7%-5.7%] tested positive for HBsAg. HBsAg prevalence was 3.3% (95% CI: 2.1%-4.8%) for women tested during pregnancy, 4.5% (2.5%-7.4%) for those tested at delivery, and 8.5% (5.6%-12.2%) for those tested post-partum (Ptrend = 0.001). In multivariate models including socio-economic status (SES), type of care facility, duration of antiretroviral therapy, HIV viral load, and self-reported intimate partner violence (IPV), lowest tertile of SES, ≤ 6 months of ART, and IPV were all consistently and positively associated with higher prevalence of HBsAg across pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum period while been tested in a health centre or having a viral load ≥ 1000 copies/mL were consistently associated with lower prevalence. However, only the association with IPV (OR = 2.74, 95% CI: 1.10–6.84) and viral load between 40–1000 copies/ml (OR = 4.28, 95% CI: 1.22–15.01) achieved statistical significance among pregnant women. Conclusion This study revealed an overall high prevalence of HBsAg among HIV-infected pregnant and post-partum women in Kinshasa with the latter showing the highest HBsAg prevalence. Among pregnant women, intimate partner violence was independently and statistically associated with HBsAg positivity, requiring further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2944506567,"Purpose To obtain new rapid assessment of avoidable blindness (RAAB) data on the prevalence, causes and trends of blindness, visual impairment and cataract surgery; and compare the new 2018 data with the older RAAB 2009 data. Methodology The second nationwide RAAB used android based mRAAB technique and technology for data collection. Using the compact segment sampling probability proportionate to size, 5,050 participants from 101 clusters of 50 people aged 50 years and older were enrolled through house-to-house visits. Eligible participants received ophthalmic examination and interview by the ophthalmologist-led emuneration team as per the RAAB protocol. Results The age-sex adjusted magnitude of bilateral blindness in Bhutan was 1.0% (95% Confidence Interval, CI 0.5–1.4) with relatively higher prevalence in rural population (Odds Ratio, OR 1.5, p = 0.13) and women (OR 1.6, p = 0.06). Untreated cataract accounted for the most of blindness (53.8%), severe vision impairment (57.1%), and moderate visual impairment (65.3%); uncorrected refractive error was the main cause of early visual impairment (46.7%). Cataract Surgical Coverage was 86.1% with relatively better coverage in men (76.7% men; 73.1% female) and urban population (79.2% urban; 70.2% rural). Good cataract surgical outcome was achieved in 67.3% and leading cause of poor outcome was ocular comorbidity (43.6%). Accessibility was a significant barrier to the uptake of cataract surgical services. Conclusion There is a 33% reduction in blindness from 1.5% to 1.0%, since the first RAAB survey in 2009. In order to further reduce blindness and visual impairment, Bhutan should continue to implement long-term strategic action plan for eye health focused on strengthening primary eye care and comprehensive eye care service."
https://openalex.org/W2943860148,"A father’s involvement in prenatal care engenders health benefits for both mothers and children. While this information can help practitioners improve family health, low paternal involvement in prenatal care remains a challenge. The present study tested a simple, easily scalable intervention to promote father involvement by increasing men’s feelings of comfort and expectations of involvement in prenatal settings through three randomized control trials. Borrowing from social psychological theory on identity safety, the three studies tested whether the inclusion of environmental cues that represent men and fatherhood in prenatal care offices influenced men’s beliefs and behavioral intentions during the perinatal period. Men in studies 1 and 3 viewed online videos of purported prenatal care offices, while men in study 2 visited the office in person. Those who viewed or were immersed in a father-friendly prenatal care office believed that doctors had higher expectations of father involvement compared to treatment-as-usual. This perception predicted greater parenting confidence, comfort, and behavioral intentions to learn about the pregnancy and engage in healthy habits, such as avoiding smoking and alcohol during their partner’s pregnancy. Study 3 replicated these studies with an online sample of expectant fathers. The results suggest that shifting environment office cues can signal fathering norms to men in prenatal settings, with healthier downstream behavior intentions."
https://openalex.org/W2943976894,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) recording have complementary spatiotemporal resolution limitations but can be powerful methods when used together to enable both functional and anatomical modeling, with each neuroimaging procedure used to maximum advantage. We recorded EEGs during event-related fMRI followed by DTI in 15 healthy volunteers and 12 patients with schizophrenia using an omission mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm. Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes were calculated in a region of interest (ROI) analysis, and fractional anisotropy (FA) in the white matter fibers related to each area was compared between groups using tract-specific analysis. Patients with schizophrenia had reduced BOLD activity in the left middle temporal gyrus, and BOLD activity in the right insula and right parahippocampal gyrus significantly correlated with positive symptoms on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and hostility subscores. BOLD activation of Heschl's gyri also correlated with the limbic system, including the insula. FA values in the left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) significantly correlated with changes in the BOLD signal in the right superior temporal gyrus (STG), and FA values in the right ACC significantly correlated with PANSS scores. This is the first study to examine MMN using simultaneous fMRI, EEG, and DTI recording in patients with schizophrenia to investigate the potential implications of abnormalities in the ACC and limbic system, including the insula and parahippocampal gyrus, as well as the STG. Structural changes in the ACC during schizophrenia may represent part of the neural basis for the observed MMN deficits. The deficits seen in the feedback/feedforward connections between the prefrontal cortex and STG modulated by the ACC and insula may specifically contribute to impaired MMN generation and clinical manifestations."
https://openalex.org/W2944217298,"Whiplash-associated disorder (WAD) causes substantial social and economic burden, with ≥70% patients classified as WADII (neck complaint and musculoskeletal sign(s)). Effective management in the acute stage is required to prevent development of chronicity; an issue for 60% of patients. An Active Behavioural Physiotherapy Intervention (ABPI) was developed to address both physical and psychological components of WAD. The ABPI is a novel complex intervention designed through a rigorous sequential multiphase project to prevent transition of acute WAD to chronicity. An external pilot and feasibility cluster randomised double-blind (assessor, participants) parallel two-arm clinical trial was conducted in the UK private sector. The trial compared ABPI versus standard physiotherapy to evaluate trial procedures and feasibility of the ABPI for managing acute WADII in preparation for a future definitive trial. Six private physiotherapy clinics were recruited and cluster randomised using a computer-generated randomisation sequence. Twenty-eight (20 ABPI, 8 standard physiotherapy) participants [median age 38.00 (IQR = 21.50) years] were recruited. Data were analysed descriptively with a priori establishment of success criteria. Ninety-five percent of participants in the ABPI arm fully recovered (Neck Disability Index ≤4, compared to 17% in the standard physiotherapy arm); required fewer treatment sessions; and demonstrated greater improvement in all outcome measures (pain intensity, Cervical Range of Motion, Pressure Pain Threshold, EuroQol-5 Dimensions) except for the Impact of Events Scale and Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire. The findings support the potential value of the ABPI, and that an adequately powered definitive trial to evaluate effectiveness (clinical, cost) is feasible with minor modifications to procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2944779094,"The cardiac diagnostic workup of stroke patients, especially the value of echocardiography and enhanced and prolonged Holter-ECG monitoring, is still a matter of debate. We aimed to analyse the impact of pathologies detected by echocardiography and ECG monitoring on therapeutic decisions and prognosis.Find-AFRANDOMISED was a prospective multicenter study which randomised 398 acute ischemic stroke patients ≥ 60 years to enhanced and prolonged Holter-ECG monitoring or usual stroke unit care. This substudy compared therapeutic consequences of echocardiography and routine Holter-ECG or enhanced and prolonged Holter-ECG monitoring, respectively, and prognosis of patients with or without pathologic findings in echocardiography or Holter-ECG monitoring.50.3% received enhanced and prolonged Holter-ECG monitoring and 49.7% routine ECG monitoring. 82.9% underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), 38.9% transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and 25.6% both procedures. 14/89 TEE pathologies and 1/90 TTE pathology led to a change in therapy, resulting in a number needed to change decision (NNCD) of 12 and 330 (p < 0.001), respectively. In comparison, enhanced and prolonged Holter-ECG monitoring found atrial fibrillation (AF) in 27 of 200 patients, and routine ECG monitoring in twelve of 198 patients, leading to therapeutic changes in all patients (NNCD 8 and 17, respectively, p < 0.001).Most changes in therapeutic decisions were triggered by enhanced and prolonged Holter-ECG monitoring, which should therefore play a more prominent role in future guidelines. Echocardiography identifies a patient group at high cardiovascular risk, but rarely result in therapeutic changes. Whether this patient group requires further cardiovascular workup remains unknown. This should be further investigated by interdisciplinary neurocardiologic teams and in appropriate future trials.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01855035."
https://openalex.org/W2944519062,"Age-stratified serologic surveys provide insight into the gaps of measles-specific immunity as well as estimates of the age-specific seroprevalence. The aim of this study was to describe the measles sero-epidemiology in Vojvodina before the occurrence of outbreak in 2017/18 and to discuss preventive measures for potential future epidemics.A seroprevalence study was conducted from April 2015 to June 2017 on serum bank of 3199 residual samples. Study was performed prior to the last measles outbreak in Vojvodina that occurred between 12th November 2017 and 30th June 2018. Measles-specific IgG antibodies were determined using an indirect chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA).Median age of enrolled participants was 20 years (IQR 11-37). Overall, 86.9% serum samples were seropositive. The highest proportion of measles seronegativity was observed in children aged 12-23 months of age and in adults aged 20-39 years (56.1% and 18.5%, respectively). Prevalence of measles seronegativity above WHO target levels susceptibility was observed in the following age groups: 2, 7, 13, 15, and among all adults aged between 20 and 49 years. Out of total measles outbreak cases (177), there were 91 (51.4%) participants aged 20-39 years. A significant positive correlation was observed between measles seronegativity and the number of reported measles cases aged ≥ 12 months (r = 0.4675, p = 0.0213).In order to prevent new outbreaks and achieve the elimination of measles in Vojvodina, the vaccination coverage of both measles-mumps-rubella (MMR1 and MMR2) vaccines needs to be improved and sustained. Educational campaigns for the improvement of acceptance and timely vaccination with vaccine against measles among doctors and the general population are crucial. Our results indicate possible gap in measles protection in adults born during implementation of one dose of measles vaccine and prioritize supplementary immunization activities targeting adults in Vojvodina, Serbia."
https://openalex.org/W2944039895,"Introduction The reported prevalence rate of violence varies considerably between studies, even when conducted in similar populations. The reasons for this are largely unknown. This article considers the effects of nonresponse bias on the reported prevalence rate of interpersonal violence. We also single out violence perpetrated in intimate relationships and compare our results to previous Swedish studies. The aim was to explore the reasons for the large discrepancies in the prevalence rates found between studies. Material and method This is a cross sectional study of a random population sample. The NorVold Abuse Questionnaire (NorAQ), covering emotional, physical, and sexual violence, was answered by 754 men (response rate 35%) and 749 women (response rate 38%). Nonresponse bias was investigated in six ways, e.g., findings were replicated in two samples and we explored non-responders’ reasons for declining participation. Also, the prevalence rate of intimate partner violence was compared to four previous studies conducted in Sweden, considering the methodological differences. Results and discussion The only evidence of nonresponse bias found was for differences between the sample and the background population concerning the sociodemographic characteristics. However, the magnitude of that effect is bleak in comparison with the large discrepancies found in the prevalence rates between studies concerning intimate partner violence, e.g., emotional violence women: 11–41% and men: 4–37%; sexual and/or physical violence women: 12–27% and men: 2–21%. Some of the reasons behind these differences were obvious and pertained to differences in the definition and operationalization of violence. However, a considerable proportion of the difference could not easily be accounted for. Conclusion It is not reasonable that so little is known about the large discrepancies in the prevalence rate for what is supposedly the same concept, i.e., intimate partner violence. This study is a call for more empirical research on methods to investigate violence."
https://openalex.org/W2944382100,"This study sought to examine the interactive relations of socioeconomic status and race to corticolimbic regions that may play a key role in translating stress to the poor health outcomes overrepresented among those of lower socioeconomic status and African American race. Participants were 200 community-dwelling, self-identified African American and White adults from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span SCAN study. Brain volumes were derived using T1-weighted MP-RAGE images. Socioeconomic status by race interactions were observed for right medial prefrontal cortex (B = .26, p = .014), left medial prefrontal cortex (B = .26, p = .017), left orbital prefrontal cortex (B = .22, p = .037), and left anterior cingulate cortex (B = .27, p = .018), wherein higher socioeconomic status Whites had greater volumes than all other groups. Additionally, higher versus lower socioeconomic status persons had greater right and left hippocampal (B = -.15, p = .030; B = -.19, p = .004, respectively) and amygdalar (B = -.17, p = .015; B = -.21; p = .002, respectively) volumes. Whites had greater right and left hippocampal (B = -.17, p = .012; B = -.20, p = .003, respectively), right orbital prefrontal cortex (B = -.34, p < 0.001), and right anterior cingulate cortex (B = -.18, p = 0.011) volumes than African Americans. Among many factors, the higher levels of lifetime chronic stress associated with lower socioeconomic status and African American race may adversely affect corticolimbic circuitry. These relations may help explain race- and socioeconomic status-related disparities in adverse health outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2943847400,"Odontoblasts are post-mitotic cells responsible for maintenance of the dentin, and are therefore important for dental health. In some cases, irreversible pulpitis leads to necrosis and consequently death of odontoblasts. Regenerative endodontics (RE) uses the concept of tissue engineering to restore the root canals to a healthy state, allowing for continued development of the root and surrounding tissue. Human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs) have been successfully used in RE to restore odontoblast function. Surface microgeometry is one of the most important factors involved in the induction of differentiation of hDPSCs into odontoblast-like cells. Although different authors have demonstrated the importance of a dentin-like surface with accessible dentin tubules to induce differentiation of hDPSCs, the ultrastructural characteristics of the cells and the secreted extracellular matrix have not been studied in depth. Here, we used an acellular dentin scaffold containing dentin tubules in different spatial geometries, which regulated their accessibility to cells. hDPSCs were cultured on the scaffolds for up to 6 weeks. Systematic characterization of differentiated cells was performed using both optical (hematoxylin and eosin, Masson trichrome, and immunohistochemical determination of dentin sialoprotein [DSSP]) and transmission electron microscopy. The results presented here indicated that cells grown on the dentin surface containing accessible dentin tubules developed a characteristic odontoblastic phenotype, with cellular processes similar to native odontoblasts. The cell organization and characteristics of secreted extracellular matrix were also similar to those of native dentin tissue. Cells grown on non-accessible dentin tubule surfaces secreted a more abundant and dense extracellular matrix, and developed a different phenotype consisting of secretory flat cells organized in layers. Cells grown far from the scaffold, i.e., directly on the culture well surface, developed a secretory phenotype probably influenced by biochemical factors released by the dentin scaffold or differentiated cells. The results presented here support the use of hDPSCs to regenerate dentin and show the utility of scaffold microgeometry for determining the differentiation and secretory phenotype of cultured cells."
https://openalex.org/W2944270692,"Background Maternal mortality rates are still unacceptably high in many countries, indicating violation of women´s human right to life and health. Access to adequate information about maternal health rights and available services are essential aspects of realizing women´s right to accessible health care. This study aimed at assessing awareness of the right to access maternal health services among women who had recently given birth, and the association between such awareness and the utilization of maternal health services in two districts in Tanzania. Methods This study was cross sectional in design. Interviews were conducted with women who gave birth within one year prior to the survey in two different district councils (DC) namely Hai DC and Morogoro DC, selected purposively based on the earlier reported rates of maternal mortality. We used a two-stage cluster sampling to select the study sample. Analysis employed Chi-square test and Logistic regression. Results A total of 547 respondents were interviewed. Only a third (34.4%) reported to be aware of their right to access maternal health services. Main sources of information on maternal health rights were the media and health care providers. Occupation and education level showed a statistically significant association with awareness of access rights. Hai DC had higher proportion of women aware of their access rights compared to Morogoro DC. Women who were aware of their right of access were almost 5 times more likely to use skilled birth attendants compared to those who were not (AOR 4.61 95% CI: 2.14–8.57). Conclusion and recommendations Awareness of the right to access maternal health services was low in the studied population. To increase awareness and hence uptake of Pregnancy care and skilled birth attendants at delivery we recommend the government and partners to prioritize provision of information, communication and education on women´s human rights, including the right to access maternal health services, especially to women in rural areas."
https://openalex.org/W2944639932,"Regulatory agencies establish that a broad physicochemical and biological characterization is necessary for the evaluation of comparability between a biosimilar candidate product and a reference commercial drug. Between them, conformational characterization of proteins is of vital importance to determine its folding and biological functions. In this work, the conformational features of a novel monoclonal antibody (called 5G4) were evaluated by means of circular dichroism spectroscopy and fluorescence. Secondary structure and thermal stability of mAbs were determined by circular dichroism in the far ultraviolet, while three-dimensional folding of proteins was analyzed by both circular dichroism in the near ultraviolet and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. In all experiments, Herceptin (Roche) was used as control. Both antibodies showed a composition of secondary structure predominantly of β-sheets (55–56%) and thermal stability of ~ 75°C, suggesting structural similarity. The three-dimensional folding of proteins was also similar due to the absorption spectra of the aromatic residues and the emission wavelength maxima by fluorescence were comparable. The values of the fluorescence attenuation constant (Stern-Volmer constant) for increasing concentrations of acrylamide were also similar, suggesting a degree of exposure of tryptophan residues similar, although it was slightly decreased for Herceptin. Our data permit to consider that 5G4 monoclonal antibody showed similar conformational characteristics when compared with Herceptin."

In this study, we integrated high-throughput transcriptome and proteome sequencing to construct a comprehensive protein database for the byssus of Chinese green mussel (Perna viridis), aiming at providing novel insights into the molecular mechanisms by which the byssus binds to heavy metals. Illumina transcriptome sequencing generated a total of 55,670,668 reads. After filtration, we obtained 53,047,718 clean reads and subjected them to de novo assembly using Trinity software. Finally, we annotated 73,264 unigenes and predicted a total of 34,298 protein coding sequences. Moreover, byssal samples were analyzed by proteome sequencing, with the translated protein database from the foot transcriptome as the reference for further prediction of byssal proteins. We eventually determined 187 protein sequences in the byssus, of which 181 proteins are reported for the first time. Interestingly, we observed that many of these byssal proteins are rich in histidine or cysteine residues, which may contribute to the byssal accumulation of heavy metals. Finally, we picked one representative protein, Pvfp-5-1, for recombinant protein synthesis and experimental verification of its efficient binding to cadmium (Cd2+) ions."
https://openalex.org/W2944513990,"A genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction of Salinibacter ruber DSM13855 is presented here. To our knowledge, this is the first metabolic model of an organism in the phylum Rhodothermaeota. This model, which will be called iMB631, was reconstructed based on genomic and biochemical data available on the strain Salinibacter ruber DSM13855. This network consists of 1459 reactions, 1363 metabolites and 631 genes. Model evaluation was performed based on existing biochemical data in the literature and also by performing laboratory experiments. For growth on different carbon sources, we show that iMB631 is able to correctly predict the growth in 91% of cases where growth has been observed experimentally and 83% of conditions in which S. ruber did not grow. The F-score was 93%, demonstrating a generally acceptable performance of the model. Based on the predicted flux distributions, we found that under certain autotrophic condition, a reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle (rTCA) has fluxes in all necessary reactions to support autotrophic growth. To include special metabolites of the bacterium, salinixanthin biosynthesis pathway was modeled based on the pathway proposed recently. For years, main glucose consumption pathway has been under debates in S. ruber. Using flux balance analysis, iMB631 predicts pentose phosphate pathway, rather than glycolysis, as the active glucose consumption method in the S. ruber."
https://openalex.org/W2944543512,"Background The literature on the relationship between lifestyle behaviors and inflammatory markers is scarce. Methods A birth cohort was followed since birth up to 22 years in Southern Brazil. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP) and adiponectin were measured in nonfasting blood samples drawn at 18 and 22 years of age. Exposures including smoking, alcohol intake, physical inactivity and obesity, were collected at 15, 18 and 22 years. Cross sectional analyses were based on the number of follow-up visits with these exposures and the association with IL-6, CRP and adiponectin at 22 years old. We also carried out a longitudinal Generalized Least Squares (GLS) random-effects analysis with outcomes at 18 and at 22 years old. All analyses were adjusted for several covariates. Results The sample comprised 3,479 cohort members at 22 years. The presence of obesity at ≥ 2 follow-ups showed the highest mean values (SE) for IL-6 [2.45 (1.05)] and CRP [3.74 (1.11)] and the lowest mean value for adiponectin [8.60 (0.37)] (adjusted analyses, females) compared with other exposures; the highest mean of IL-6 [1.65 (1.05)] and CRP [1.78 (1.11)] and the lowest mean of adiponectin [9.98 (0.38)] were for the number of follow-ups with ≥2 exposures compared to those with no exposures at any follow-up (adjusted analyses, females). The longitudinal analysis showed an increase in obesity associated with IL-6 and CRP in both sexes and an inverse association with adiponectin in females; smoking (in males) was associated with IL-6 and CRP, harmful alcohol intake was associated with CRP in males, and increased in physical activity was inversely associated with CRP in men. Conclusion We concluded that obesity is the main exposure positively associated with IL-6 and CRP and inversely associated with adiponectin (mainly in females). Smoking is also associated with these markers in the longitudinal analysis (in males)."
https://openalex.org/W2944631093,"Rising sea levels dramatically alter the vegetation composition and structure of coastal ecosystems. However, the implications of these changes for coastal wildlife are poorly understood. We aimed to quantify responses of avian communities to forest change (i.e., ghost forests) in a low-lying coastal region highly vulnerable to rising sea level. We conducted point counts to sample avian communities at 156 forested points in eastern North Carolina, USA in 2013-2015. We modelled avian community composition using a multi-species hierarchical occupancy model and used metrics of vegetation structure derived from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data as covariates related to variation in bird responses. We used this model to predict occupancy for each bird species in 2001 (using an analogous 2001 LiDAR dataset) and 2014 and used the change in occupancy probability to estimate habitat losses and gains at 3 spatial extents: 1) the entire study area, 2) burned forests only, and 3) unburned, low-lying coastal forests only. Of the 56 bird species we investigated, we observed parameter estimates corresponding to a higher likelihood of occurring in ghost forest for 34 species, but only 9 of those had 95% posterior intervals that did not overlap 0, thus having strong support. Despite the high vulnerability of forests in the region to sea level rise, habitat losses and gains associated with rising sea level were small relative to those resulting from wildfire. Though the extent of habitat changes associated with the development of ghost forest was limited, these changes likely are more permanent and may compound over time as sea level rises at an increasing rate. As such, the proliferation of ghost forests from rising sea level has potential to become an important driver of forest bird habitat change in coastal regions."
https://openalex.org/W2944704748,"The ""Stent retriever Assisted Vacuum-locked Extraction"" (SAVE) technique is a promising embolectomy method for intracranial large vessel occlusion (LVO). We report our experience using a modified SAVE (mSAVE) approach for clot reduction prior to embolectomy in acute ischemic stroke patients with large clots.We retrospectively analyzed 20 consecutive patients undergoing mSAVE in our center due to intracranial LVO. Angiographic data (including first-pass and overall complete reperfusion, defined as an expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) score of 3, rate of successful reperfusion (eTICI ≥2c), number of passes, time from groin puncture to reperfusion) and clinical data (favorable outcome at 90 days, defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) ≤2) were assessed.First-pass and overall eTICI 3 reperfusion was reached in 13/20 (65%) and 14/20 (70%), respectively. The rate of successful reperfusion (eTICI ≥2c) after one pass was 85% and on final angiogram 90% with an average number of 1.1 ± 0.3 attempts. Eight out of 11 (73%) ICA occlusions were reperfused successfully and 5 (46%) completely after a single pass. Median groin to reperfusion time was 33 minutes (IQR 25-46). A favorable clinical outcome was achieved in 9/20 (45%) patients at discharge and after 90 days, respectively.Clot reduction followed by embolectomy (mSAVE) is feasible and may be an important tool in the treatment of large clots."
https://openalex.org/W2949202258,"Under typical daytime light levels, the human pupillary light response (PLR) is driven by the activity of the L, M, and S cones, and melanopsin expressed in the so-called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs). However, the importance of each of these photoreceptive mechanisms in defining pupil size under real-world viewing conditions remains to be established. To address this question, we embedded photoreceptor-specific modulations in a movie displayed using a novel projector-based five-primary spatial stimulation system, which allowed for the precise control of photoreceptor activations in time and space. We measured the pupillary light response in eleven observers, who viewed short cartoon movies which contained hidden low-frequency (0.25 Hz) silent-substitution modulations of the L, M and S cones (no stimulation of melanopsin), melanopsin (no stimulation of L, M and S cones), both L, M, and S cones and melanopsin or no modulation at all. We find that all photoreceptors active at photopic light levels regulate pupil size under this condition. Our data imply that embedding modulations in photoreceptor contrast could provide a method to manipulate key adaptive aspects of the human visual system in everyday, real-world activities such as watching a movie."
https://openalex.org/W2952725397,"Patients experiencing adverse drug events (ADE) in many developing countries are in the best position to report these events to the authorities but need to be empowered to do so. Systematic evaluation of community engagement and patient support especially in rural areas would provide evidence for a program to monitor potential harm from medicines. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of a community dialogue and sensitization (CDS) program on the knowledge, attitude and practises of community members for reporting ADE.This an uncontrolled before-after study was conducted in two eastern Ugandan districts between September 2016 and August 2017.After implementation of the community dialogue and sensitization (CDS) program, there was an overall 20% (95% CI:16% to 25%) increase in knowledge about ADE in the community compared to before the program began. Awareness levels increased by 50% (95% CI: 37% to 63%) among those with little or no education and by41% (95% CI: 31% to 52%) among young people (15-24 years). Furthermore, 5% (95% CI: 3% to 7%) more respondents recognized the need for reporting ADEs compared to before the program. Finally, there was a significant increase of 115% (95% CI:137% to 217%) in respondent recognition and reporting of ADEs compared to the beginning of the CDS program. Overall, this community found the CDS program acceptable and proposed aspects that could be improved for future use.Our evaluation showed that the CDS program increased knowledge and improved attitudes by catalyzing discussions among community members and healthcare professionals on health issues and monitoring safety of medicines compared to before the program. Successful implementation of the program depends on holistic health systems strengthening and adaptation to the community's way of life."
https://openalex.org/W2952732782,"The chive gnat, Bradysia odoriphaga, is a notorious pest of Allium species in China. Colour trapping is an established method for monitoring and control of Bradysia species. In order to clarify the effect of colour preference of B. odoriphaga for the perched substrate, multiple-choice tests were used to assess the response of the chive gnat to different colour hues and brightness levels under different intensities of white illumination and two spectrally different illuminations. Given the choice among four colours differing in hue under different intensities of white illumination and two spectrally different illuminations, chive gnat adults significant preferred the black substrate, a lesser preference to brown and green substrates, and the least preference to orange substrate irrespective of illumination. Given the choice among four levels of brightness under the same illumination conditions as those in the previous experiment (different intensities of white illumination and two spectrally different illuminations), chive gnats preferred black substrate over dark grey, light grey and white substrates. Meanwhile, both virgin and mated adults significantly preferred black over other colour hues and brightness. Based on our results, we conclude that the chive gnat adults significantly prefer black substrates irrespective of colour hues and brightness. This behaviour does not alter with ambient light condition changes. No difference observed between choices of female and male adults. Our results provide new insight for understanding the colour choice behaviour in chive gnat and pave a way to improve monitoring and control of chive gnats and management."
https://openalex.org/W2944167716,"Perioperative chemotherapy (CT) or neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in patients with locally advanced gastric (GC) or gastroesophageal junction cancer (GEJC) has been shown to improve survival compared to an exclusive surgical approach. However, most patients retain a poor prognosis due to important relapse rates. Population pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling may allow identifying at risk-patients. We aimed to develop a mechanistic PK/PD model to characterize the relationship between the type of neoadjuvant therapy, histopathologic response and survival times in locally advanced GC and GEJC patients.Patients with locally advanced GC and GEJC treated with neoadjuvant CT with or without preoperative CRT were analyzed. Clinical response was assessed by CT-scan and EUS. Pathologic response was defined as a reduction on pTNM stage compared to baseline cTNM. Metastasis development risk and overall survival (OS) were described using the population approach with NONMEM 7.3. Model evaluation was performed through predictive checks.A low correlation was observed between clinical and pathologic TNM stage for both T (R = 0.32) and N (R = 0.19) categories. A low correlation between clinical and pathologic response was noticed (R = -0.29). The OS model adequately described the observed survival rates. Disease recurrence, cTNM stage ≥3 and linitis plastica absence, were correlated to a higher risk of death.Our model adequately described clinical response profiles, though pathologic response could not be predicted. Although the risk of disease recurrence and survival were linked, the identification of alternative approaches aimed to tailor therapeutic strategies to the individual patient risk warrants further research."
https://openalex.org/W2943916712,"Biological and bioinspired polymer microparticles have broad biomedical and industrial applications, including drug delivery, tissue engineering, surface modification, environmental remediation, imaging, and sensing. Full realization of the potential of biopolymer microparticles will require methods for rigorous characterization of particle sizes, morphologies, and dynamics, so that researchers may correlate particle characteristics with synthesis methods and desired functions. Toward this end, we evaluated biopolymer microparticles using flow imaging microscopy. This technology is widely used in the biopharmaceutical industry but is not yet well-known among the materials community. Our polymer, a genetically engineered elastin-like polypeptide (ELP), self-assembles into micron-scale coacervates. We performed flow imaging of ELP coacervates using two different instruments, one with a lower size limit of approximately 2 microns, the other with a lower size limit of approximately 300 nanometers. We validated flow imaging results by comparison with dynamic light scattering and atomic force microscopy analyses. We explored the effects of various solvent conditions on ELP coacervate size, morphology, and behavior, such as the dispersion of single particles versus aggregates. We found that flow imaging is a superior tool for rapid and thorough particle analysis of ELP coacervates in solution. We anticipate that researchers studying many types of microscale protein or polymer assemblies will be interested in flow imaging as a tool for quantitative, solution-based characterization."
https://openalex.org/W2944032464,"Background and objective Anorexia nervosa (AN) is one of the most difficult-to-treat psychiatric disorders. AN is associated with individual vulnerability, societal and family factors. There has been limited research in Asia regarding the patients or their families’ perceptions on its treatment. This study explored the perceived treatment outcomes among Chinese families having adolescents with AN. Methods Qualitative interviews were conducted on parents of adolescents with AN recruited through an eating disorder association in Hong Kong to understand their views and experiences regarding the help-seeking and treatment process. Results The parents expressed dissatisfaction towards help-seeking and treatment outcomes, including relationships with health professionals, hospitalization, health professionals’ knowledge of AN, understanding of the treatment model and parents’ role, amount of psychological support, and coordination among health professionals. The parents were unclear about the treatment plan as they received little explanation from the health professionals. The parents perceived that the AN treatment only focused on weight restoration with limited psychological support. Home diet monitoring was seen as a harsh task which worsened the relationship with their children. The parents often needed to take up the coordinator role and search around for different health professionals and integrate their advices by themselves. Conclusions The study shows that limited psychoeducation, communication and coordination in the treatment for AN are major problems in a Chinese context. Open communication between the health professionals and the parents about the expected treatment outcomes and limitations is needed to enhance their mutual trust. Besides, treatment should emphasize not only family involvement but also empower them to fight against AN."
https://openalex.org/W2944303761,"Patients with renal impairment have altered immunity, which might cause vulnerability to specific pathogens and worsen pneumonia-related outcomes. Nonetheless, the microbiological features of pneumonia in patients with decreased renal function remain unknown.Therefore, we conducted a retrospective cohort study enrolling adult patients hospitalized with pneumonia to assess this knowledge gap. The baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and first sputum microbiology during hospitalization were used for statistical analyses.Overall, 1554 patients hospitalized with pneumonia (mean age, 76.1 ± 16.7) were included, and 162 patients had died at the end of hospitalization. The cutoff eGFR value predicting mortality was <55 mL/min/1.73 m2, which defined decreased renal function in this study. Patients with decreased renal function demonstrated a significantly higher risk of fungi and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infection. On the other hand, this group of patients showed significantly higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), which associated with higher mortality. Additionally, patients with S. aureus had a significantly lower eGFR, lymphocyte count and a higher NLR.These findings suggested the altered immunity and vulnerability to S. aureus infection in patients with decreased renal function, which may be the underlying cause of worse outcomes of pneumonia in this group of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2944436597,"With the help of the method of Lagrange multipliers and KKT theory, we investigate the structure and existence of optimal solutions of the continuous-time model of consumption with satiation. We show that the differential equations have no solutions in the C1 class but that solutions exist in a wider space of functions, namely, the space of functions of bounded variation with non-negative Borel measures as controls. We prove our theorems with no additional assumptions about the structure of the control Borel measures. We prove the conjecture made in the earlier literature, that there are only three types of solutions: I-shaped solutions, with a gulp of consumption at the end of the interval and no consumption at the beginning or in the interior; U-shaped solutions, with consumption in the entire interior of the interval and gulps at the beginning and the end; and intermediate (J-shaped) solutions, with an initial interval of abstinence followed by a terminal interval of distributed consumption at rates and a gulp at the end. We also establish the criteria that permit determination of the solution type using the problem's parameters. When the solution structure is known, we reduce the problem of the existence of a solution to algebraic equations and discuss the solvability of these equations. We construct explicit solutions for logarithmic utility and CRRA utility."
