https://openalex.org/W1985477980,"INVESTIGATIONS on the fatty-acid composition of ox fat have revealed the presence of a consecutive series of volatile fatty acids from C2 to C10. Prior to this communication, there appears to be no record of fatty acids with molecular weight lower than that of C10 1 occurring in animal depot fats, with the exception of isovaleric acid in porpoises and dolphins2. The presence in milk fats of C 4–C 10 volatile fatty acids with an even number of carbon atoms has long been known and this knowledge has been supplemented by the identification in 1951 of acetic acid in goat milk fat. In recent times, however, volatile fatty acids have also been reported as occurring in the perienteric fluid of Ascaris lumbricoides from the pig, in rumen contents of sheep, in grass–water slurries, in the fatty substances present in human hair, in the skin secretions (hair grease) of a number of animals, and in the liver lipids of rabbits and rats."

This result was discussed in a symposium of the Ciba Foundation in 1952 on Mammalian Germ Cells2,3."

https://openalex.org/W2011664869,"CERTAIN acids have been found surprisingly effective for the cytological fixation of mitochondria in various tissues from mice. In some cases, 0.1 N hydrochloric acid has proved almost as satisfactory as Altmann's or Helly's fluid (see Fig. 1). Usually, small pieces of tissue are fixed for 18–20 hr. in the acid, washed for two or more hours in water, dehydrated, cleared and embedded in paraffin. The washing does not appear to be essential. Tissues may be dehydrated directly from the acid, starting with 50 per cent ethanol. Sections cut at 3 µ are stained by either Hirschler's haematoxylin or Metzner's acid fuchsin technique. With the latter, differentiation is so rapid that it is preferable to use a reagent containing half the usual amount of picric acid. With the haematoxylin method, staining is not always uniform. After hydrochloric acid fixation, the mitochondria may be demonstrated in the cells of the liver, intestinal epithelium, renal tubules and pancreatic acini. Other tissues have not yet been studied. The best results have been obtained with liver, the least satisfactory with pancreas. Nitric or sulphuric acid may be used in place of hydrochloric, but the fixation is not quite so good. Chromic, phosphoric, formic, acetic, oxalic and citric acids, potassium dihydrogen phosphate and potassium hydrogen phthalate are unsatisfactory. After acid fixation, there appears to be no advantage in postchroming the above tissues except, possibly, the pancreas. In the case of hydrochloric acid at least, the results are not improved by making the solution isotonic."
