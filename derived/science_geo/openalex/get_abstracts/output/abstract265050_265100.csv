https://openalex.org/W2015865850,"Continuous axenic cultures were established of Trichonympha sphaerica, a cellulose-digesting symbiotic protozoon in the gut of a termite. The cultured flagellates harbored no endosymbiotic bacteria and metabolized cellulose to acetate, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. Thus, the cellulolytic activity of this flagellate is an inherent property and is not dependent on endosymbiotic bacteria."

https://openalex.org/W1994804503,"Ash from Mount St. Helens has fallen over a diverse agricultural area, with deposits of up to 30 kilograms per square meter. Crop losses in eastern Washington are estimated at about $100 million in 1980-about 7 percent of the normal crop value in the affected area and less than was expected initially. Production of wheat, potatoes, and apples will be normal or above normal because the favorable conditions for growth of these crops since the ashfall helped offset the losses. Alfalfa hay was severely lodged under the weight of the ash, but ash-contaminated hay is apparently nontoxic when eaten by livestock. The ash as an abrasive is lethal to certain insects, such as bees and grasshoppers, but populations are recovering. The ash has increased crop production costs by necessitating machinery repairs and increased tillage. On soil, the ash reduces water infiltration, increases surface albedo, and may continue to affect water runoff, erosion, evaporation, and soil temperature even when tilled into the soil. Ash on plant leaves reduced photosynthesis by up to 90 percent. Most plants have tended to shed the ash. With the possible exception of sulfur, the elements in the ash are either unavailable or present in very low concentrations; and no significant contribution to the nutrient status of soils is expected."
https://openalex.org/W2049684474,"The Shuttle Experiment conducted between Hawaii and Tahiti from January 1979 to June 1980 was designed to observe the changing equatorial ocean structure and circulation, to study the variations and interactions of the four major equatorial ocean currents, and to develop a scientific basis for their monitoring by simple observations of thermal structure and sea level. Preliminary analyses of the results show that the equatorial thermal structure remains intact during a normal year and that only the positions and intensities of the currents are subject to change. The water transport of the equatorial undercurrent varied from 25 x 10(6) cubic meters per second in January to 51 x 10(6) cubic meters per second in July, but also exhibited strong short-term pulsations. The equatorial surface flow responded strongly to the winds at periods of 1 month and longer. An array of drifter buoys in the equatoral countercurrent was subject to very little dispersion while traveling over 4500 kilometers in 4 months. Low-frequency fluctuations in the North Equatorial Countercurrent can be monitored by means of the difference in sea level between Fanning and Majuro."
https://openalex.org/W1980891565,"Rapid increases in the price of imported crude oil have accelerated a shift in the raw material base for chemical feedstocks from natural gas to crude oil to coal. Widespread use of ethylene as a feedstock has depended on the availability at attractive prices of natural gas and petroleum. As the resource base shifts from natural gas and petroleum to coal, ethylene is being replaced by synthesis gas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide of varying composition), which can be manufactured directly from any of these carbonaceous sources. This trend is expected to accelerate in the 1980's. Organics likely to be produced from synthesis gas include ethanol, ethylene glycol, and vinyl acetate."
https://openalex.org/W2082943961,"Frequently repeated strain measurements near Palmdale, California, during the period from 1971 through 1980 indicate that, in addition to a uniform accumulation of right-lateral shear strain (engineering shear, 0.35 microradian per year) across the San Andreas fault, a 1-microstrain contraction perpendicular to the fault that accumulated gradually during the interval 1974 through 1978 was aseismically released between February and November 1979. Subsequently (November 1979 to March 1980), about half of the contraction was recovered. This sequence of strain changes can be explained in terms of south-southwestward migration of a slip event consisting of the south-southwestward movement of the upper crust on a horizontal detachment surface at a depth of 10 to 30 kilometers. The large strain change in 1979 corresponds to the passage of the slip event beneath the San Andreas fault."

https://openalex.org/W1976810048,The evolution of broadly attached thoracic lobes could have increased the body temperature excess of ancient wingless insects by 55 percent over that of lobeless forms. The subsequent expansion of these thoracic lobes for behavioral thermoregulation could have provided the morphological stage required for the evolution of functional wings.
https://openalex.org/W2028081997,"Round to oval, scalelike siliceous microstructures from cherts in Cambrian limestones of the western Yukon Territory suggest affinity with chrysophycean algae. At least six morphotypes present include porous forms with single branching processes and nonporous oval, ringlike forms. Partially dissolved specimens may indicate a contribution to contemporaneous or early diagenetic chert formation."

https://openalex.org/W2025021693,An unusual stress transient was recorded 15 kilometers from the epicenter of the Lytle Creek earthquake in southern California. It was observed at the recording site as an increased shear stress parallel to the fault surface and with the proper sense of shear to have triggered the earthquake. The anomaly began 2 to 4 weeks before the earthquake and lasted for 3 months.
