Jiang et al. leveraged entropy engineering to synthesize a single-phase high-entropy alloy with attractive thermoelectric properties. By increasing the number of elements in the alloy, the resulting disorder helps to stabilize against breakdown into multiple phases. The disordered and distorted crystal lattice suppresses thermal transport while maintaining the electrical properties, which boosts the heat-conversion efficiency of the material.

The viral protein main protease is required for cleaving precursor polyproteins into functional viral proteins. This essential function makes it a key drug target. Qiao et al. designed 32 inhibitors based on either boceprevir or telaprevir, both of which are protease inhibitors approved to treat hepatitis C virus. Six compounds protected cells from viral infection with high potency, and two of these were selected for in vivo studies based on pharmokinetic experiments. Both showed strong antiviral activity in a mouse model. Science , this issue p. 1374"
https://openalex.org/W3129476455,"A limitation of spatial transcriptomics technologies is that individual measurements may contain contributions from multiple cells, hindering the discovery of cell-type-specific spatial patterns of localization and expression. Here, we develop robust cell type decomposition (RCTD), a computational method that leverages cell type profiles learned from single-cell RNA-seq to decompose cell type mixtures while correcting for differences across sequencing technologies. We demonstrate the ability of RCTD to detect mixtures and identify cell types on simulated datasets. Furthermore, RCTD accurately reproduces known cell type and subtype localization patterns in Slide-seq and Visium datasets of the mouse brain. Finally, we show how RCTD’s recovery of cell type localization enables the discovery of genes within a cell type whose expression depends on spatial environment. Spatial mapping of cell types with RCTD enables the spatial components of cellular identity to be defined, uncovering new principles of cellular organization in biological tissue. RCTD is publicly available as an open-source R package at https://github.com/dmcable/RCTD . Cell type mapping in spatial transcriptomics is enabled by accounting for compositional mixtures and differences in sequencing technologies."

We know less about fresh waters, including large rivers. Su et al. looked across such systems globally, focusing on several key measures of fish biodiversity. They found that half of all river systems have been heavily affected by human activities, with only very large tropical river basins receiving the lowest levels of change. Fragmentation and non-native species have also led to the homogenization of rivers, with many now containing similar species and fewer specialized lineages. Science , this issue p. 835"
https://openalex.org/W3129242605,"Although metabolism plays an active role in antibiotic lethality, antibiotic resistance is generally associated with drug target modification, enzymatic inactivation, and/or transport rather than metabolic processes. Evolution experiments of Escherichia coli rely on growth-dependent selection, which may provide a limited view of the antibiotic resistance landscape. We sequenced and analyzed E. coli adapted to representative antibiotics at increasingly heightened metabolic states. This revealed various underappreciated noncanonical genes, such as those related to central carbon and energy metabolism, which are implicated in antibiotic resistance. These metabolic alterations lead to lower basal respiration, which prevents antibiotic-mediated induction of tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, thus avoiding metabolic toxicity and minimizing drug lethality. Several of the identified metabolism-specific mutations are overrepresented in the genomes of >3500 clinical E. coli pathogens, indicating clinical relevance."

Cholangiocytes are epithelial cells that line bile ducts and modify bile as its transported through the biliary tree. Chronic liver diseases involving cholangiocytes account for a large fraction of liver failure and the need for liver transplantation. Because liver donors are in short supply, Sampaziotis et al. used organoid technology to develop a cell-based therapy using human tissue (see the Perspective by Kurial and Willenbring). Cholangiocyte organoids were transplanted into the intrahepatic ducts of deceased human donor livers undergoing ex vivo normothermic perfusion. The livers could be maintained for up to 100 hours, and the transplanted organoids engrafted, exhibited function, and could repair bile ducts. Science , this issue p. 839 ; see also p. 786"

The masses of black holes in these x-ray binaries are all lower than those detected using gravitational waves, challenging models of black hole formation from massive stars. Miller-Jones et al. used radio astrometry to refine the distance to Cygnus X-1, a well-studied x-ray binary. They found a larger distance than previous estimates, raising the mass of the black hole in the system to 21 solar masses.

https://openalex.org/W3130261739,"A recipe for new genes Most lineages contain evolutionarily novel genes, but their origin is not always clear. Cosby et al. investigated the origin of families of lineage-specific vertebrate genes (see the Perspective by Wacholder and Carvunis). Fusion between transposable elements (TEs) and host gene exons, once incorporated into the host genome, could generate new functional genes. Examination of KARABINER , a bat gene that arose through this process, shows how the retention of part of the TE within this gene allows the transcribed protein to bind throughout the genome and act as a transcriptional regulator. Thus, TEs interacting within their host genome provide the raw material to generate new combinations of functional domains that can be selected upon and incorporated within the hierarchical cellular network.

We leverage the power of de novo computational design coupled with a ""hypothesis, design, and test"" approach to determine TMB design principles, notably, the importance of negative design to slow β-sheet assembly. We design new eight-stranded TMBs, with no homology to known TMBs, that insert and fold reversibly into synthetic lipid membranes and have nuclear magnetic resonance and x-ray crystal structures very similar to the computational models. These advances should enable the custom design of pores for a wide range of applications."

Cooper et al. created a precisely dated radiocarbon record around the time of the Laschamps geomagnetic reversal about 41,000 years ago from the rings of New Zealand swamp kauri trees. This record reveals a substantial increase in the carbon-14 content of the atmosphere culminating during the period of weakening magnetic field strength preceding the polarity switch. The authors modeled the consequences of this event and concluded that the geomagnetic field minimum caused substantial changes in atmospheric ozone concentration that drove synchronous global climate and environmental shifts.

https://openalex.org/W3129867447,"Dynamic activation of a GPCR G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) coordinate a complex information flow between the outside and inside of a cell. An increasing number of GPCR structures provide insight into function. However, the dynamics that link extracellular sensing to intracellular signaling are not completely understood, because GPCRs used in structure determination are generally modified to constrain their dynamics. Josephs et al. succeeded in determining the structures of an unmodified calcitonin gene–related peptide receptor, which is implicated in migraines, both alone and bound to its neuropeptide ligand. Based on the structures and data from complementary biophysical techniques, they show that initial binding of the peptide causes only minor conformational changes of the GPCR, but dynamically causes changes at the intracellular side that facilitate G protein binding and activation.

https://openalex.org/W3133260372,"A key manifestation of superfluidity in liquids and gases is a reduction of the moment of inertia under slow rotations. Non-classical rotational effects have been searched for a long time also for the elusive supersolid phase of matter, in which superfluidity coexists with a lattice structure. Here we show that the recently discovered supersolid phase in dipolar quantum gases features a reduced moment of inertia. We study a peculiar rotational oscillation mode in a harmonic potential, the scissors mode, already employed for superfluids. From the measured moment of inertia, we infer a superfluid fraction that is different from zero and of order of unity, providing direct evidence of the superfluid nature of the dipolar supersolid."
https://openalex.org/W3129445171,"Recurrent breast cancer presents significant challenges with aggressive phenotypes and treatment resistance. Therefore, novel therapeutics are urgently needed. Here, we report that murine recurrent breast tumor cells, when compared with primary tumor cells, are highly sensitive to ferroptosis. Discoidin Domain Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 2 (DDR2), the receptor for collagen I, is highly expressed in ferroptosis-sensitive recurrent tumor cells and human mesenchymal breast cancer cells. EMT regulators, TWIST and SNAIL, significantly induce DDR2 expression and sensitize ferroptosis in a DDR2-dependent manner. Erastin treatment induces DDR2 upregulation and phosphorylation, independent of collagen I. Furthermore, DDR2 knockdown in recurrent tumor cells reduces clonogenic proliferation. Importantly, both the ferroptosis protection and reduced clonogenic growth may be compatible with the compromised YAP/TAZ upon DDR2 inhibition. Collectively, these findings identify the important role of EMT-driven DDR2 upregulation in recurrent tumors in maintaining growth advantage but activating YAP/TAZ-mediated ferroptosis susceptibility, providing potential strategies to eradicate recurrent breast cancer cells with mesenchymal features."

The ability to reprogram proteases to cleave new sequences of our choosing would enable new therapeutic and biotechnological applications. Blum et al. report a laboratory evolution method to rapidly evolve proteases that cut new protein sequences and lose their ability to cut nontarget sequences (see the Perspective by Stenmark). Using this method, they evolved botulinum neurotoxin proteases, an important class of enzymes used in patients, to selectively cleave new targets, including a protein unrelated to those natively cleaved by these proteases.

Although electron distributions of occupied orbitals can be imaged in momentum space by photoemission tomography, it has so far been impossible to follow the momentum-space dynamics of a molecular orbital in time, for example, through an excitation or a chemical reaction. Here, we combined time-resolved photoemission using high laser harmonics and a momentum microscope to establish a tomographic, femtosecond pump-probe experiment of unoccupied molecular orbitals. We measured the full momentum-space distribution of transiently excited electrons, connecting their excited-state dynamics to real-space excitation pathways. Because in molecules this distribution is closely linked to orbital shapes, our experiment may, in the future, offer the possibility of observing ultrafast electron motion in time and space."

https://openalex.org/W3129226110,"Abstract Targeted therapies for gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) are modestly effective, but GIST cannot be cured with single agent tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In this study, we sought to identify new therapeutic targets in GIST by investigating the tumor microenvironment. Here, we identified a paracrine signaling network by which cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) drive GIST growth and metastasis. Specifically, CAFs isolated from human tumors were found to produce high levels of platelet-derived growth factor C (PDGFC), which activated PDGFC-PDGFRA signal transduction in GIST cells that regulated the expression of SLUG , an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) transcription factor and downstream target of PDGFRA signaling. Together, this paracrine induce signal transduction cascade promoted tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Moreover, in metastatic GIST patients, SLUG expression positively correlated with tumor size and mitotic index. Given that CAF paracrine signaling modulated GIST biology, we directly targeted CAFs with a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, which synergized with imatinib to increase tumor cell killing and in vivo disease response. Taken together, we identified a previously unappreciated cellular target for GIST therapy in order to improve disease control and cure rates."
https://openalex.org/W3131404750,"Progressive loss of dopamine inputs in Parkinson's disease leads to imbalances in coordinated signaling of dopamine and acetylcholine (ACh) in the striatum, which is thought to contribute to parkinsonian motor symptoms. As reciprocal interactions between dopamine inputs and cholinergic interneurons (ChIs) control striatal dopamine and ACh transmission, we examined how partial dopamine depletion in an early-stage mouse model for Parkinson's disease alters nigral regulation of cholinergic activity. We found region-specific alterations in how remaining dopamine inputs regulate cholinergic excitability that differ between the dorsomedial (DMS) and dorsolateral (DLS) striatum. Specifically, we found that dopamine depletion downregulates metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1) on DLS ChIs at synapses where dopamine inputs co-release glutamate, abolishing the ability of dopamine inputs to drive burst firing. This loss underlies parkinsonian motor impairments, as viral rescue of mGluR1 signaling in DLS ChIs was sufficient to restore circuit function and attenuate motor deficits in early-stage parkinsonian mice."
https://openalex.org/W3129455777,"Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is associated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the mechanism by which NSAIDs suppress colorectal tumorigenesis remains unclear. We previously showed that NSAIDs selectively kill emerging tumor cells via death receptor (DR) signaling and a synthetic lethal interaction mediated by the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein BID. In this study, we found NSAIDs induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress to activate DR signaling and BID in tumor suppression. Importantly, our results unveiled an ER stress- and BID-dependent immunogenic effect of NSAIDs, which may be critical for tumor suppression. NSAID treatment induced hallmarks of immunogenic cell death (ICD) in CRC cells and colonic epithelial cells upon loss of APC tumor suppressor, and elevated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the polyps of APCMin/+ mice. ER stress inhibition or BID deletion abrogated the antitumor and immunogenic effects of NSAIDs. Furthermore, increased ER stress and TILs were detected in human advanced adenomas from NSAID-treated patients. Together, our results suggest that NSAIDs induce ER stress- and BID-mediated ICD to restore immunosurveillance and suppress colorectal tumor formation."
https://openalex.org/W3129374526,"During a flight, pilots must rigorously monitor their flight instruments since it is one of the critical activities that contribute to update their situation awareness. The monitoring is cognitively demanding, but is necessary for timely intervention in the event of a parameter deviation. Many studies have shown that a large part of commercial aviation accidents involved poor cockpit monitoring from the crew. Research in eye-tracking has developed numerous metrics to examine visual strategies in fields such as art viewing, sports, chess, reading, aviation, and space. In this article, we propose to use both basic and advanced eye metrics to study visual information acquisition, gaze dispersion, and gaze patterning among novices and pilots. The experiment involved a group of sixteen certified professional pilots and a group of sixteen novice during a manual landing task scenario performed in a flight simulator. The two groups landed three times with different levels of difficulty (manipulated via a double task paradigm). Compared to novices, professional pilots had a higher perceptual efficiency (more numerous and shorter dwells), a better distribution of attention, an ambient mode of visual attention, and more complex and elaborate visual scanning patterns. We classified pilot’s profiles (novices—experts) by machine learning based on Cosine KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) using transition matrices. Several eye metrics were also sensitive to the landing difficulty. Our results can benefit the aviation domain by helping to assess the monitoring performance of the crews, improve initial and recurrent training and ultimately reduce incidents, and accidents due to human error."
https://openalex.org/W3129427611,"Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a plasma glycoprotein that circulates noncovalently bound to blood coagulation factor VIII (fVIII). VWF is a population of multimers composed of a variable number of ∼280 kDa monomers that is activated in shear flow to bind collagen and platelet glycoprotein Ibα. Electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, small-angle neutron scattering, and theoretical studies have produced a model in which the conformation of VWF under static conditions is a compact, globular “ball-of-yarn,” implying strong, attractive forces between monomers. We performed sedimentation velocity (SV) analytical ultracentrifugation measurements on unfractionated VWF/fVIII complexes. There was a 20% per mg/ml decrease in the weight-average sedimentation coefficient, sw, in contrast to the ∼1% per mg/ml decrease observed for compact globular proteins. SV and dynamic light scattering measurements were performed on VWF/fVIII complexes fractionated by size-exclusion chromatography to obtain sw values and z-average diffusion coefficients, Dz. Molecular weights estimated using these values in the Svedberg equation ranged from 1.7 to 4.1 MDa. Frictional ratios calculated from Dz and molecular weights ranged from 2.9 to 3.4, in contrast to values of 1.1–1.3 observed for globular proteins.

These results indicate that interactions between monomers are weak or nonexistent and that activation of VWF is intramonomeric. Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a large plasma glycoprotein that participates in platelet adhesion and aggregation and serves as a transport protein for blood coagulation factor VIII (fVIII). The participation of VWF in platelet function and fVIII transport is necessary for normal hemostasis. Decreased levels or dysfunctional VWF collectively produce the disorder von Willebrand disease. In its mild form, von Willebrand disease is the most common congenital bleeding disorder (1Johnsen J. Ginsburg D. von Willebrand disease.in: Kaushansky K. Lichtman M.A. Prchal J.T. Levi M.M.

Severe von Willebrand disease is a life-threatening disorder that, in addition to a marked inability to support platelet function, produces a hemophilia A-like syndrome due to low levels of fVIII. VWF is synthesized in endothelial cells, where it is either secreted constitutively or stored in Weibel–Palade bodies, and in megakaryocytes, where it is stored in α-granules (2Wagner D.D.

VWF is a multimer consisting of a linear chain of covalently linked ∼277 kDa subunits called monomers. It is intrinsically heterogeneous with respect to the number of monomers per multimer (2Wagner D.D. Cell biology of von Willebrand factor.Ann. Rev.

These descriptions suggest that the conformation of VWF/fVIII is a function of strong attractive forces between monomers. The unfolding of the compact state in shear flow is considered an essential feature of the activation of VWF to support platelet function. An alternative conformation is a random coil, or synonymously, a flexible chain, defined as a chain in which one of its elements can have any direction relative to another element if the distance between elements is large enough (20Tanford C. Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY1961Google Scholar). The distinction between globular and flexible conformations can be resolved using hydrodynamic methods. These methods are particularly useful if a homologous series of polymers is available for study and have been applied extensively to the study of the conformation of synthetic polymers, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids (20Tanford C. Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY1961Google Scholar, 21Flory P.J. Principles of Polymer Chemistry.

In this paper, the hydrodynamic properties of unfractionated VWF/FVIII and on a homologous series of fractionated VWF/fVIII multimers were characterized by sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV AUC) in quasi-static flow and by dynamic light scattering (DLS). In contrast to a compact, globular conformation, our results are consistent with a random coil conformation and the absence of intermonomeric interactions. VWF/fVIII complex was purified from the commercial, plasma-derived product, Alphanate, by heparin-Sepharose chromatography as described in Experimental procedures and Supporting information (Fig. S1). The resulting preparation, containing unfractionated VWF/fVIII complexes, was subjected to SV AUC at 45,400g. Absorbance at 280 nm (Fig. 1A) and the interference fringe increment (Fig. 1B) were measured as a function of time and radial position. The data were analyzed using the continuous c(s) distribution model in SEDFIT as described in Experimental procedures and Supporting information. Excellent fits were obtained on the order of the random noise in the data acquisition. Although only a single boundary is evident in Figure 1, A and B, the broad c(s) distributions revealed a polydisperse population of species sedimenting predominantly between 10 and 30 S (Fig. 1C). Diffusion contributes to the shape of the sedimenting boundary for particles that diffuse on a timescale of sedimentation. The continuous c(s) distribution model attempts to deconvolute the contribution of diffusion to the boundary structure. It utilizes the functional relationship between the diffusion coefficient and the frictional ratio for a single species and assumes that a common frictional ratio can be used as a fitted parameter as described in Supporting information (24Schuck P.

Sedimentation Velocity Analytical Ultracentrifugation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2017Google Scholar). For monodisperse systems, the model provides accurate measurements of the sedimentation coefficient, frictional ratio, and diffusion coefficient, as judged by its ability to estimate molecular weights accurately using the Svedberg equation (25Dam J. Schuck P. Calculating sedimentation coefficient distributions by direct modeling of sedimentation velocity concentration profiles.Methods Enzymol. 2004; 384: 185-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In polydisperse systems, the model captures some elements of the diffusion process and returns a single weighted frictional ratio, but molecular weights generally cannot be estimated accurately. Nonetheless, the weight-average sedimentation coefficient, sw, of a polydisperse system can be measured using the continuous c(s) distribution model (27Schuck P. On the analysis of protein self-association by sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation.Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 104-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 28Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P. Modern analytical ultracentrifugation in protein science: A tutorial review.Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). For polydisperse systems consisting of species with variable extinction or fringe coefficients, sw is a signal-average value and not a true weight-average. However, for VWF/fVIII, the extinction coefficient at 280 nm and the fringe extinction coefficient are constant for all multimers and equal to that of the monomer, allowing measurement of true sw values. Integration of the c(s) distributions in Figure 1C and adjusting the resulting sw values to the standard condition, (sw)20,w, of 20 °C in solvent water yielded values of 23.2 S and 23.5 S by absorbance and interference measurements, respectively. The data in Figure 1, A and B were also fitted to the ls-g∗(s) model in SEDFIT, which assumes no diffusion during the centrifugation process (24Schuck P. Size-distribution analysis of macromolecules by sedimentation velocity ultracentrifugation and Lamm equation modeling.Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2945) Google Scholar). Although sw values were produced that were close to the values in the continuous c(s) distribution model, the fits were poorer at the 95% confidence level as judged by F-statistics of the rmsd ratios (29Garland C.W. Nibler J.W. Shoemaker D.P. Experiments in Physical Chemistry.8th Ed. McGraw-Hill, Boston, MA2009Google Scholar) using the variance ratio calculator in SEDFIT. Thus, the continuous c(s) distribution model was used for the remainder of the study. In the absence of self-association, the sedimentation coefficients of macromolecules decrease with increasing concentration, largely due to the effects of solution nonideality on the frictional coefficient (21Flory P.J. Principles of Polymer Chemistry. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY1953Google Scholar). (sw)20,w values of unfractionated VWF/fVIII were measured as a function of loading concentrations from 0.14 to 1.1 mg/ml and decreased by ∼20% per mg/ml (Fig. 1D). In contrast, the sedimentation coefficient of bovine serum albumin decreased by only ∼1% per mg/ml (Fig. 1D) in agreement with the decrease typically observed for compact, globular proteins (30Patel T.R. Winzor D.J. Scott D.J. Allowance for radial dilution in evaluating the concentration dependence of sedimentation coefficients for globular proteins.Eur. Biophys. J. Biophys. Lett. 2018; 47: 291-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), which is close to the theoretical value of 0.5% per mg/ml for a sphere with a density of 1.4 mg/ml (31Batchelor G.K. Sedimentation in a dilute dispersion of spheres.J. Fluid Mech. 1972; 52: 245-268Crossref Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Thus, the concentration-dependent decrease in sw for unfractionated VWF/fVIII is inconsistent with a compact, globular conformation. Additionally, there was no evidence for self-association, which manifests as an increase in sedimentation coefficient with concentration. Sedimentation in the ultracentrifuge produces quasi-static flow in which centrifugal motion of the macromolecule is matched by centripetal flow of displaced solvent. The scans shown in Figure 1, A and B taken over 4 h of centrifugation show that the velocity of VWF/fVIII as revealed by boundary migration is less than 1 cm per hour. The frictional force experienced by a particle during centrifugation is the product of the frictional coefficient and velocity, fv, and because of the low velocity is typically only on the order of fN (32Schuck P. Zhao H. Brautigam C.A. Ghirlando R. Basic Principles of Analytical Ultracentrifugation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL2016Crossref Google Scholar). However, long linear macromolecules can undergo a conformational change due to the frictional forces experienced during ultracentrifugation, which manifests as a decrease in the sedimentation coefficient with increasing rotor speed (33Zimm B.H. Anomalies in sedimentation. IV. Decrease in sedimentation coefficients of chains at high fields.Biophys. Chem. 1974; 1: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, the sw of unfractionated VWF/FVIII complexes was investigated by comparing c(s) distributions at 16,400g (15,000 RPM) and 45,400g (25,000 RPM). Figure 1, E and F show that the c(s) distributions are superimposable at the two rotor speeds. This result indicates that the conformation of VWF/FVIII is not altered by ultracentrifugation and is consistent with the fact that conformational changes during ultracentrifugation have only been observed for particles with molecular weights greater than 100 MDa (33Zimm B.H. Anomalies in sedimentation. IV. Decrease in sedimentation coefficients of chains at high fields.Biophys. Chem. 1974; 1: 279-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). VWF/fVIII multimers are an example of a homologous series of polymers, analogous to synthetic polymers, polysaccharides, and nucleic acids. The hydrodynamic characterization of partially fractionated homologs is a powerful method to assess solution conformation (20Tanford C. Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules. John Wiley & Sons, New York, NY1961Google Scholar, 21Flory P.J. Principles of Polymer Chemistry. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY1953Google Scholar, 22Gillis R.B. Rowe A.J. Adams G.G.

A tutorial mini-review.J. Mol. Biol. 2020; 432: 2930-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). VWF/fVIII was fractionated by Sephacryl S-1000 size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) as described in Experimental procedures. Figure 2 shows the resulting chromatogram, revealing a broad distribution due to the polydispersity of VWF multimers. SEC fractions were pooled to produce samples labeled A through E as indicated. FVIII activity was present across the distribution up to a trailing minor peak containing material that has not been identified. The concentrations of VWF and fVIII activity in the heparin-Sepharose purified starting material were 0.54 mg/ml and 38 U/ml, respectively, yielding a specific fVIII activity of 70 U/mg. Since the specific activity of fVIII in the absence of VWF is ∼5000 U/mg (34Rotblat F. O'Brien D.P. O'Brien F.J. Goodall A.H. Tuddenham E.G.D. Purification of human factor VIII:C and its characterization by Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies.Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4294-4300Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the percentage mass ratio of fVIII to VWF is ∼1%. This approximates the probability that a vWf monomer contains a bound fVIII since the molecular weights of the VWF monomer and fVIII are nearly equal. The median molecular weight of a plasma-derived VWF multimer has been estimated to be 2.2 MDa by EM. Since Figure 2 indicates that fVIII is randomly distributed across the multimer population, a 2.2 MDa 8-mer has only a ∼10% chance of being occupied by fVIII. Thus, the hydrodynamic properties of the multimer population are unlikely to be influenced by fVIII. SEC-fractionated VWF/fVIII complexes were subjected to SV AUC as described in Experimental procedures. Figure 3, A–E shows fits of absorbance data to the continuous c(s) distribution model. The resulting c(s) distributions are shown in Figure 3F, which were integrated to produce (sw)20,w values. As expected, (sw)20,w decreased with increasing elution volume, ranging from 27.7 to 16.8 S (Table 1). In contrast to Samples A–D, in which only a single boundary was discernable, the scans for Sample E revealed at least two boundaries and c(s) distribution analysis identified a minor ∼5 S peak (Fig. 3, E and F). The width of the c(s) distributions in Figure 3F indicates that there is significant polydispersity since the peak width of monodisperse samples typically is less than 1 S at similar loading concentrations. Interference scans were obtained during the same run and yielded (sw)20,w values within 1.0 S of the absorbance data for all samples (Supporting information, Fig. S2 and Table 1). Although still polydisperse, these results indicate that SEC fractionation provides resolution of the sedimentation behavior of VWF/fVIII complexes.Table 1SV and DLS analysis of SEC-fractionated VWF/fVIII complexesSample(sw)20,w (S)(Dz)20,w × 107 (cm2 s−1)PDIRh (nm)MW (MDa)f/foA280IFA280IFA280IFA27.74 (27.52, 27.97)26.81 (27.74, 26.88)0.620 (0.609, 0.631)0.2632.34.103.923.373.42B25.80 (25.63, 26.96)25.65 (25.59, 25.75)0.650 (0.647, 0.653)0.2430.83.663.593.333.36C23.27 (23.11, 23.44)23.24 (23.19, 23.32)0.712 (0.706, 0.718)0.2428.23.042.993.223.26D20.45 (20.37, 20.62)20.70 (20.65, 20.75)0.792 (0.787, 0.797)0.1625.32.432.423.103.15E16.84 (16.73, 16.99)16.80 (16.70, 16.95)0.946 (0.943, 0.949)0.2421.21.711.682.902.98A280, absorbance at 280 nm; IF, interference.Numbers in parentheses represent 95% confidence intervals.(sw)20,w: Weight-average sedimentation coefficient adjusted the standard condition of 20 °C in water.(Dz)20,w: z-average diffusion coefficient adjusted to the standard condition of 20 °C in water.PDI: polydispersity index (Equation 6).Rh: Hydrodynamic radius (Equation 7).f/fo: frictional ratio (Equations 8 and 9).

DLS measurements were made on SEC Samples A–E to obtain estimates of the z-average diffusion coefficients and hydrodynamic radii. Figure 4 shows the fits of the normalized electric field correlation function, g1(τ), to decay times using cumulants analysis. The decay curves shift from right to left from A to E corresponding to increasing SEC elution volume, consistent with faster diffusion and smaller hydrodynamic radii of the eluting species. The z-average diffusion coefficients, (Dz)20,w, obtained from the first moment of the cumulants analysis, ranged from 0.620 × 10−7 to 0.946 10−7 cm2 s−1 (Table 1). The polydispersity indices (PDI) ranged from 0.16 to 0.26 (Table 1). Values below 0.15 are considered consistent with monodispersity (35Brautigam C.A. Applications and complementarity of analytical ultracentrifugation and light scattering.in: Ramesh V. Biomolecular and Bioanalytical Techniques. John Wiley & Sons, Hoboken, NJ2019: 255-278Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, the polydispersity reflects incomplete separation of the VWF multimers, consistent with the SV results in Figure 3. Hydrodynamic radii were calculated using the Stokes–Einstein equation (Equation 7) and ranged from 21.2 to 32.3 nm (Table 1). SEC fractionation of VWF/fVIII complexes provided sufficient resolution to produce distinct sw and Dz values (Table 1). Estimates of sedimentation and diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution, (sw0)20,w and (Dz0)20,w, were made as described in Experimental procedures and used to calculate molecular weights using the Svedberg equation (Equation 14) with the caveat that combining weight- and z-averages produces a molecular weight estimate that is neither a weight- or z-average. Molecular weight estimates ranged from 1.7 to 4.1 MDa (Table 1). Using a molecular weight of 277 kDa for the mature VWF monomer based on amino acid sequence and carbohydrate composition (7Chopek M.W.

https://openalex.org/W3133387640,"Recent years have seen an increasing number of genetically engineered pig models of human diseases including cancer. We previously generated pigs with a modified TP53 allele that carries a Cre-removable transcriptional stop signal in intron 1, and an oncogenic mutation TP53R167H (orthologous to human TP53R175H) in exon 5. Pigs with the unrecombined mutant allele (flTP53R167H) develop mainly osteosarcoma but also nephroblastomas and lymphomas. This observation suggested that TP53 gene dysfunction is itself the key initiator of bone tumorigenesis, but raises the question which aspects of the TP53 regulation lead to the development of such a narrow tumour spectrum. Molecular analysis of p53 revealed the presence of two internal TP53 promoters (Pint and P2) equivalent to those found in human. Consequently, both pig and human express TP53 isoforms. Data presented here strongly suggest that P2-driven expression of the mutant R167H-Δ152p53 isoform (equivalent to the human R175H-Δ160p53 isoform) and its circular counterpart circTP53 determine the tumour spectrum and play a critical role in the malignant transformation in flTP53R167H pigs. The detection of Δ152p53 isoform mRNA in serum is indicative of tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we showed a tissue-specific p53-dependent deregulation of the p63 and p73 isoforms in these tumours. This study highlights important species-specific differences in the transcriptional regulation of TP53. Considering the similarities of TP53 regulation between pig and human, these observations provide useful pointers for further investigation into isoform function including the novel circTP53 in both the pig model and human patients."
https://openalex.org/W3131404057,"Measuring cognitive load is important for surgical education and patient safety. Traditional approaches of measuring cognitive load of surgeons utilise behavioural metrics to measure performance and surveys and questionnaires to collect reports of subjective experience. These have disadvantages such as sporadic data, occasionally intrusive methodologies, subjective or misleading self-reporting. In addition, traditional approaches use subjective metrics that cannot distinguish between skill levels. Functional neuroimaging data was collected using a high density, wireless NIRS device from sixteen surgeons (11 attending surgeons and 5 surgery resident) and 17 students while they performed two laparoscopic tasks (Peg transfer and String pass). Participant’s subjective mental load was assessed using the NASA-TLX survey. Machine learning approaches were used for predicting the subjective experience and skill levels. The Prefrontal cortex (PFC) activations were greater in students who reported higher-than-median task load, as measured by the NASA-TLX survey. However in the case of attending surgeons the opposite tendency was observed, namely higher activations in the lower v higher task loaded subjects. We found that response was greater in the left PFC of students particularly near the dorso- and ventrolateral areas. We quantified the ability of PFC activation to predict the differences in skill and task load using machine learning while focussing on the effects of NIRS channel separation distance on the results. Our results showed that the classification of skill level and subjective task load could be predicted based on PFC activation with an accuracy of nearly 90%. Our finding shows that there is sufficient information available in the optical signals to make accurate predictions about the surgeons’ subjective experiences and skill levels. The high accuracy of results is encouraging and suggest the integration of the strategy developed in this study as a promising approach to design automated, more accurate and objective evaluation methods."
https://openalex.org/W3131074692,"The hypothalamus plays crucial roles in regulating endocrine, autonomic, and behavioral functions via its diverse nuclei and neuronal subtypes. The developmental mechanisms underlying ontogenetic establishment of different hypothalamic nuclei and generation of neuronal diversity remain largely unknown. Here, we show that combinatorial T-box 3 (TBX3), orthopedia homeobox (OTP), and distal-less homeobox (DLX) expression delineates all arcuate nucleus (Arc) neurons and defines four distinct subpopulations, whereas combinatorial NKX2.1/SF1 and OTP/DLX expression identifies ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and tuberal nucleus (TuN) neuronal subpopulations, respectively. Developmental analysis indicates that all four Arc subpopulations are mosaically and simultaneously generated from embryonic Arc progenitors, whereas glutamatergic VMH neurons and GABAergic TuN neurons are sequentially generated from common embryonic VMH progenitors. Moreover, clonal lineage-tracing analysis reveals that diverse lineages from multipotent radial glia progenitors orchestrate Arc and VMH-TuN establishment. Together, our study reveals cellular mechanisms underlying generation and organization of diverse neuronal subtypes and ontogenetic establishment of individual nuclei in the mammalian hypothalamus."
https://openalex.org/W3130313437,"Cytokines and chemokines are important regulators of airway hyper-responsiveness, immune cell infiltration, and inflammation and are produced when mast cells are stimulated with interleukin-33 (IL-33). Here, we establish that the salt-inducible kinases (SIKs) are required for the IL-33-stimulated transcription of il13, gm-csf and tnf and hence the production of these cytokines. The IL-33-stimulated secretion of IL-13, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, and tumor necrosis factor was strongly reduced in fetal liver-derived mast cells from mice expressing a kinase-inactive mutant of SIK3 and abolished in cells expressing kinase-inactive mutants of SIK2 and SIK3. The IL-33-dependent secretion of these cytokines and several chemokines was also abolished in SIK2/3 double knock-out bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMC), reduced in SIK3 KO cells but little affected in BMMC expressing kinase-inactive mutants of SIK1 and SIK2 or lacking SIK2 expression. In SIK2 knock-out BMMC, the expression of SIK3 was greatly increased. Our studies identify essential roles for SIK2 and SIK3 in producing inflammatory mediators that trigger airway inflammation. The effects of SIKs were independent of IκB kinase β, IκB kinase β-mediated NF-κB-dependent gene transcription, and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family members p38α and c-jun N-terminal kinases. Our results suggest that dual inhibitors of SIK2 and SIK3 may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of mast cell-driven diseases."

However, the mechanism by which LIG1 fidelity mediates the faithful substrate–product channeling and ligation of repair intermediates at the final steps of the BER pathway remains unclear. We previously reported that pol β 8-oxo-2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate insertion confounds LIG1, leading to the formation of ligation failure products with a 5'-adenylate block. Here, using reconstituted BER assays in vitro, we report the mutagenic ligation of pol β 8-oxo-2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate insertion products and an inefficient ligation of pol β Watson–Crick–like dG:T mismatch insertion by the LIG1 mutant with a perturbed fidelity (E346A/E592A). Moreover, our results reveal that the substrate discrimination of LIG1 for the nicked repair intermediates with preinserted 3'-8-oxodG or mismatches is governed by mutations at both E346 and E592 residues. Finally, we found that aprataxin and flap endonuclease 1, as compensatory DNA-end processing enzymes, can remove the 5'-adenylate block from the abortive ligation products harboring 3'-8-oxodG or the 12 possible noncanonical base pairs. These findings contribute to the understanding of the role of LIG1 as an important determinant in faithful BER and how a multiprotein complex (LIG1, pol β, aprataxin, and flap endonuclease 1) can coordinate to prevent the formation of mutagenic repair intermediates with damaged or mismatched ends at the downstream steps of the BER pathway.

In the final step, LIG catalyzes a nucleophilic attack of the 3'-OH in the DNA nick on the adenylated 5'-P to form a phosphodiester bond (8Dickson K.S. Burns C.M. Richardson J.P.

Despite the fact that the ligation mechanism is a universally conserved process, we still lack the understanding of how LIG recognizes and processes damaged or mismatched DNA ends. Successful DNA ligation relies on the formation of a Watson–Crick base pair of the nicked DNA that is formed during prior gap-filling DNA synthesis by a DNA polymerase (9Çağlayan M.

BER is a critical process for preventing the mutagenic and lethal consequences of DNA damage that arises from endogenous and environmental agents and underlies disease and aging (17Lindahl T.

Eukaryotic base excision repair: New approaches shine light on mechanism.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2019; 88: 137-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The repair pathway involves a series of sequential enzymatic steps that are tightly coordinated through protein–protein interactions in a process referred to as passing-the-baton or substrate-product channeling (19Wilson S.H. Kunkel T.A. Passing the baton in base excision repair.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 176-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 20Prasad R. Shock D.D. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H.

A review of recent experiments on step-to-step “hand-off” of the DNA intermediates in mammalian base excision repair pathways.Mol. Biol. (Mosk.). 2011; 45: 586-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This mechanism includes hand off of repair intermediates from gap-filling DNA synthesis by pol β to the DNA ligation reaction by LIG1 at the downstream steps of the BER pathway (9Çağlayan M. Interplay between DNA polymerases and DNA ligases: Influence on substrate channeling and the fidelity of DNA ligation.J. Mol. Biol. 2019; 431: 2068-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, how deviations in the functional coordination between pol β and LIG1 affect the BER process remains largely unknown. In particular, abnormalities created due to incorporation of damaged or mismatch nucleotides by pol β could lead to the formation of toxic and mutagenic repair intermediates that can drive genome instability or cell death. For example, endogenous and exogenous oxidative stress can oxidize guanine in the nucleotide pool (dGTP), resulting in the formation of the most abundant form of oxidative DNA damage, that is, the nucleotide triphosphate, 2'-deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphate (8-oxodGTP) (22Ventura I.

The deleterious effect of 8-oxodGTP is mediated through its incorporation into the genome by repair or replication DNA polymerases (24Katafuchi A. Nohmi T. DNA polymerases involved in the incorporation of oxidized nucleotides into DNA: Their efficiency and template base preference.Mutat. Res. 2010; 703: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For example, pol β performs mutagenic repair by inserting 8-oxodGTP opposite adenine within an active site that exhibits a frayed structure because of the lack of base pairing with a template base after the oxidized nucleotide insertion (25Freudenthal B.D. Beard W.A. Perera L. Shock D.D. Kim T. Schlick T. Wilson S.H. Uncovering the polymerase-induced cytotoxicity of an oxidized nucleotide.Nature. 2016; 517: 635-639Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In our prior studies, we demonstrated that pol β 8-oxodGTP insertion confounds the DNA ligation step of the BER pathway and leads to the formation of a ligation failure product with a 5'-adenylate (AMP) block (12Çağlayan M.

DNA ligase I variants fail in the ligation of mutagenic repair intermediates with mismatches and oxidative DNA damage.Mutagenesis. 2020; 35: 391-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). We also reported the effect of pol β mismatch nucleotide insertion on the substrate-product channeling to LIG1 during the final steps of BER and the fidelity of this mechanism in the presence of the epigenetically important 5-methylcytosine base modifications (15Çağlayan M.

Recently, the crystal structures of LIG1 revealed that the enzyme’s high fidelity is mediated by Mg2+-dependent DNA binding (referred as MgHiFi metal site), a strategy that the enzyme uses during the adenyl transfer and nick-sealing steps of the ligation reaction, and is scaffolded by the two conserved amino acid residues (E346 and E592) (32Tumbale P.P. Jurkiw T.J. Schellenberg M.J. Riccio A.A. O'Brien P.J. Williams R.S. Two-tiered enforcement of high-fidelity DNA ligation.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 5431Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutations at these glutamate residues to alanine (E346A/E592A or EE/AA) lead to an LIG1 enzyme with lower fidelity and create an open cavity that accommodates a damaged DNA terminus at the protein active site (32Tumbale P.P. Jurkiw T.J. Schellenberg M.J. Riccio A.A. O'Brien P.J. Williams R.S. Two-tiered enforcement of high-fidelity DNA ligation.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 5431Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, how such a distinct environment, which the staggered LIG1 conformation creates due to mutations at the MgHiFi metal site, affects ligase substrate discrimination and coordination with pol β during substrate–product channeling of repair intermediates with damaged or mismatched DNA ends at the downstream steps of BER remains entirely undefined. Aprataxin (APTX), a member of the histidine triad superfamily, hydrolyzes an adenylate (AMP) moiety from the 5'-end of DNA ligation failure products and allows further attempts at completing repair (33Tumbale P. Schellenberg M.J. Mueller G.A. Fairweather E. Watson M. Little J.N. Krahn J. Waddell I. London R.E. Williams R.S. Mechanism of APTX nicked DNA sensing and pleiotropic inactivation in neurodegenerative disease.EMBO J. 2018; 37e98875Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, we reported a role of flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) for the processing of blocked repair intermediates with 5'-AMP (34Çağlayan M. Batra V.K. Sassa A. Prasad R. Wilson S.H.

Complementation of aprataxin deficiency by base excision repair enzymes in mitochondrial extracts.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 45: 10079-10088Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This compensatory mechanism is important to complement a deficiency in APTX activity, which is associated with mutations in the aptx gene and linked to the autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 1 (AOA1) (37Ahel I. Rass U. El-Khamisy S.F. Katyal S. Clements P.M. McKinnon P.J. Caldecott K.W. West S.C. The neurodegenerative disease protein aprataxin resolves abortive DNA ligation intermediates.Nature. 2006; 443: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Recently, the process by which APTX removes 5'-AMP during the ligation of oxidative DNA damage-containing DNA ends has been suggested as a surveillance mechanism that protects LIG1 from ligation failure (32Tumbale P.P. Jurkiw T.J. Schellenberg M.J. Riccio A.A. O'Brien P.J. Williams R.S. Two-tiered enforcement of high-fidelity DNA ligation.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 5431Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Yet, the specificity of APTX and FEN1 for the repair intermediates including 5'-AMP and 3'-damaged or mismatched ends that mimic the ligation failure products after pol β–mediated mutagenic 8-oxodGTP or mismatch insertion is still unknown. In this study, we examined the importance of LIG1 fidelity for faithful substrate–product channeling and ligation of repair intermediates at the final steps of the BER pathway. For this purpose, we evaluated the LIG1 mutants with lower fidelity (E346A, E592A, and EE/AA) for the ligation of pol β nucleotide insertion products and the nicked DNA substrates with 3'-preinserted damaged or mismatched bases in vitro. Our findings revealed the mutagenic ligation of pol β 8-oxodGTP insertion products and an inefficient DNA ligation after pol β Watson–Crick–like dGTP:T mismatch insertion by the LIG1 EE/AA mutant in a reconstituted BER reaction. Moreover, the ligation efficiency of the nicked repair intermediates with preinserted 3'-8-oxodG or mismatches was found to be dependent on the type of the template base and requires the presence of a double mutation at the E346 and E592 residues that typically ensure high fidelity. Finally, our findings demonstrated the compensatory roles of the DNA-end trimming enzymes, APTX and FEN1, for the processing of the ligation failure products with a 5'-AMP in the presence of 8-oxodG or all 12 possible mismatched bases at the 3'-end of the mutagenic repair intermediate. The findings herein contribute to our understanding of the efficiency and fidelity of substrate–product channeling during the final steps of BER in situations involving aberrant LIG1 fidelity and provide novel insight into the importance of the coordinated repair by a multiprotein complex for faithful BER. We previously demonstrated that the nicked repair product of pol β 8-oxodGTP insertion cannot be used as a DNA substrate by LIG1 during substrate–product channeling at the downstream steps of BER (12Çağlayan M.

In the present study, we first evaluated the effect of low-fidelity LIG1 for the ligation of pol β 8-oxodGTP insertion products in vitro. For this purpose, we used the coupled assay that measures the activities of pol β and LIG1 simultaneously in a reaction mixture that includes LIG1 WT or EE/AA mutant, pol β, 8-oxodGTP, and one-nucleotide-gap DNA substrate with template base A or C (Fig. 1A). For the one-nucleotide-gap DNA substrate with template A, consistent with our previous studies (13Çağlayan M. Horton J.K. Dai D.P. Stefanick D.F. Wilson S.H. Oxidized nucleotide insertion by pol β confounds ligation during base excision repair.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14045Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Çağlayan M. The ligation of pol β mismatch insertion products governs the formation of promutagenic base excision DNA repair intermediates.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48: 3708-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), we observed that WT LIG1 fails after pol β 8-oxodGTP insertion opposite A (Fig. 1B, lanes 2–5). This feature of LIG1 results in ligation failure and accumulation of abortive ligation products with 5'-adenylate (5'-AMP). The observed ligation failure was accompanied by the formation of mutagenic ligation (i.e., sealing of the 3'-damage-containing nick intermediate, in this case, 8-oxodG) over the time of reaction incubation (Fig. 1C). Conversely, there was no ligation failure after pol β oxidized nucleotide insertions in the presence of the LIG1 mutant EE/AA that impairs the ligase fidelity. In this case, we only observed the products of mutagenic ligation after the pol β 8-oxodGTP insertion opposite A (Fig. 1B, lanes 6–9). The amount of this mutagenic ligation product was ∼10-fold higher than that of the product obtained with WT LIG1 (Fig. 1C). For the one-nucleotide-gap DNA substrate with template C, we also obtained the products of mutagenic ligation and ligation failure by WT LIG1 after pol β 8-oxodGTP insertion opposite C (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–8). However, due to the pol β weak insertion efficiency of 8-oxodGTP:C as reported previously (13Çağlayan M. Horton J.K. Dai D.P. Stefanick D.F. Wilson S.H. Oxidized nucleotide insertion by pol β confounds ligation during base excision repair.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14045Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 15Çağlayan M. The ligation of pol β mismatch insertion products governs the formation of promutagenic base excision DNA repair intermediates.Nucleic Acids Res. 2020; 48: 3708-3721Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), the mutagenic ligation and 5'-adenylate products accumulated at later time points of the reaction (2–6 min) compared with the products obtained at earlier time points (10–60 s) in the case of pol β 8-oxodGTP:A insertion (Fig. 1B versus Fig. 2B). Similarly, we observed only the products of mutagenic ligation in the coupled reactions that include the LIG1 low-fidelity mutant EE/AA (Fig. 2A, lanes 9–15). The amount of this mutagenic ligation product was also higher than that of the WT protein (Fig. 2B). Yet, the EE/AA mutant was ∼80-fold more efficient for ligation of the pol β product after 8-oxodGMP insertion opposite A relative to C for the initial time points (30 s and 60 s) that are common to both pol β insertion reactions (Fig. S1). In the control coupled reactions that include pol β, dGTP, and one-nucleotide-gap DNA substrate with template C, we evaluated the ligation of pol β dGTP:C insertion products in the presence of either WT protein or the LIG1 mutant EE/AA (Fig. 3A). The results demonstrated a complete ligation product over the time of reaction for both WT and the low-fidelity LIG1 mutant (Fig. 3B, lanes 2–8 and 9–15, respectively). In this case, we did not observe a significant difference in the amount of ligation products between WT and the EE/AA mutant (Fig. 3C). We then compared the efficiency of pol β nucleotide insertion and its conversion to the ligation products by WT or EE/AA mutant in the insertion (pol β alone) and coupled (pol β and LIG1) reactions separately (Fig. S2). The experiments demonstrated a more efficient conversion of pol β dGTP:C insertions to ligated repair products in the presence of the EE/AA mutant as shown by a faster decrease in the amount of the insertion products at the same time points of both reactions (Fig. S2, A and B). Overall results indicate that (i) the functional coordination between pol β and LIG1 is sensitive to the ligase fidelity and (ii) the cavity that is formed due to the EE/AA mutation at the MgHiFi of the LIG1 active site facilitates sealing of the nicked pol β repair product including an inserted 8-oxodGMP, while showing slight differences in the efficiency of mutagenic ligation depending on the type of template base to which pol β inserts the damaged nucleotide (Scheme S1). The mutations (P529L, E566K, R641L, and R771W) in the LIG1 gene have been identified in the patients with LIG1-deficiency syndrome that exhibit immunodeficiency and cancer predisposition (38Barnes D.E. Tomkinson A.E. Lehmann A.R. Webster A.D. Lindahl T.

These amino acid residues residing in the different domains of the protein are located apart from the MgHiFi (E346 and E592) at the LIG1 active site (Fig. S3). Recently, we reported that the LIG1 variants associated with LIG1-deficiency disease exhibit altered ligation fidelity for pol β–promoted mutagenesis products (14Tang Q. Kamble P. Çağlayan M. DNA ligase I variants fail in the ligation of mutagenic repair intermediates with mismatches and oxidative DNA damage.Mutagenesis. 2020; 35: 391-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In the present study, in addition to the LIG1 low-fidelity mutants, we evaluated the effect of the LIG1 variants for the ligation of pol β 8-oxodGTP insertion products in vitro using the same coupled assay as described above. In contrast to the mutagenic ligation observed with the LIG1 EE/AA mutant (Figs. 1 and 2), we obtained the ligation failure after the pol β 8-oxodGTP insertions by all LIG1 variants tested in this study (Fig. 4). For example, the LIG1 variants P529L, R771W, and R641L fail on the pol β repair product with an inserted 8-oxodGMP opposite C (Fig. 4A, lanes 6–9, 10–13, and 14–17, respectively), which yielded the ligation failure products in a BER reaction as also shown for WT LIG1 (Fig. 4A, lanes 2–5). The amounts of ligation failure products by the variants were higher than that of the WT protein and exhibit slight differences between the disease mutations (Fig. 4B). These findings suggest that the disease-associated LIG1 variants (i.e., P529L, R641L, and R771W) do not interfere with the ligase fidelity and exhibit WT level of ligation efficiency in preventing formation of mutagenic repair intermediates after pol β oxidized nucleotide insertions (Scheme S1).

However, the socioeconomic distribution of alcohol-related violence (violence committed by a person under the influence of alcohol)–and of subtypes such as alcohol-related domestic violence–remains under-examined. To examine this, data are drawn from nationally representative victimisation survey, the Crime Survey for England and Wales, from years 2013/14 to 2017/18. Socioeconomic status specific incidence and prevalence rates for alcohol-related violence (including subtypes domestic, stranger, and acquaintance violence) were created. Binomial logistic regressions were performed to test whether the likelihood of experiencing these incidents was affected by socioeconomic status when controlling for a range of pre-established risk factors associated with violence victimisation. Findings generally show lower socioeconomic groups experience higher prevalence rates of alcohol-related violence overall, and higher incidence and prevalence rates for alcohol-related domestic and acquaintance violence. Binomial logistic regression results show that the likelihood of experiencing these types of violence is affected by a person’s socioeconomic status–even when other risk factors known to be associated with violence are held constant. Along with action to address environmental and economic drivers of socioeconomic inequality, provision of publicly funded domestic violence services should be improved, and alcohol pricing and availability interventions should be investigated for their potential to disproportionately benefit lower socioeconomic groups."
https://openalex.org/W3131901294,"Background Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and statins have been identified as potentially reducing the risk of intracranial aneurysms (IA) rupture. We aim to determine the effect of this drugs on the risk of rupture of IA. Patients and methods We performed a retrospective cohort study from a prospective database of patients with IA treated in our institution between January 2013 and December 2018. Demographics, previous oral treatments, presence of multiple aneurysms, size of aneurysm, lobulation, location and morphology of the aneurysms were recorded. Patients were dichotomized as ruptured and unruptured IA. Results A total of 408 IA were treated, of which 283 (68.6%) were in women. The median age was 53, 194 (47.5%) were ruptured IA. 38 patients (9.3%) were receiving ASA and 84 (20.6%) were receiving statins at the moment of the IA diagnosis. In the multivariable regression analysis, ASA plus statin use and multiple aneurysms were independently associated with unruptured IA (OR 5.01, 95% CI, 1.37–18.33, P = 0.015 and OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.68–4.27, P&lt;0.001, respectively). Whereas, lobulated wall aneurysm and PComA/AComA location were inversely and independently associated with unruptured IA condition (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.21–0.55, P&lt;0.001 and OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.23–0.60, P&lt;0.001, respectively). However, ASA and statins in monotherapy were not independently associated with unruptured IA condition. Conclusions In our study population ASA plus statins treatment is independently associated with unruptured IA. Larger and prospective studies are required to explore this potential protective effect against IA rupture."

In total, 720 pollen grains were studied. They were analysed with respect to seven quantitative features (length of the polar axis ˗ P, equatorial diameter ˗ E, length of the ectoaperture ˗ Le, exine thickness ˗ Ex, and P/E, Ex/P and Le/P ratios) and the following qualitative ones: pollen outline and exine ornamentation. The most important features were exine ornamentation (muri, lumina and margo) characters. The pollen features should be treated as auxiliary because they allowed to distinguish eight individual Salix species, and five groups of species. Statistical analysis of the studied traits indicated a high variability among the tested species. The most variable biometric features were P, E and Le, while lower variability occurred in P/E, Le/P and d/E."
https://openalex.org/W3132862163,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is aggressive, highly metastatic and characterized by a robust desmoplasia. Connexin proteins that form gap junctions have been implicated in tumor suppression for over 30 years. Cx43, the most widely expressed connexin, regulates cell behaviors, including migration and proliferation. Thus, we hypothesized that Cx43 could regulate PDA progression. Phosphorylation of Cx43 by Casein Kinase 1 (CK1) regulates gap junction assembly. We interbred the well-established KrasLSL-G12D/+;p48Cre/+ (KC) mouse model of PDA with homozygous “knock-in” mutant Cx43 mice bearing amino acid substitution at CK1 sites (Cx43CK1A) and found profound and surprising effects on cancer progression. Crossing the Cx43CK1A mouse onto the KC background (termed KC;CxCK1A) led to significant extension of lifespan, from a median of 370 to 486 days (p = 0.03) and a decreased incidence of metastasis (p = 0.045). However, when we examined early stages of disease, we found more rapid onset of tissue remodeling in the KC;CxCK1A mouse followed by divergence to a cystic phenotype. During tumorigenesis, gap junctions are increasingly present in stromal cells of the KC mice but are absent from the KC;Cx43CK1A mice. Tail vein metastasis assays with cells derived from KC or KC;CxCK1A tumors showed that KC;CxCK1A cells could efficiently colonize the lung and downregulate Cx43 expression, arguing that inhibition of metastasis was not occurring at the distal site. Instead, stromal gap junctions, their associated signaling events or other unknown Cx43-dependent events facilitate metastatic capacity in the primary tumor."
https://openalex.org/W3133270999,"Thymus organogenesis and T cell development are coordinated by various soluble and cell-bound molecules. Heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans can interact with and immobilize many soluble mediators, creating fields or gradients of secreted ligands. While the role of HS in the development of many organs has been studied extensively, little is known about its function in the thymus. Here, we examined the distribution of HS in the thymus and the effect of its absence on thymus organogenesis and T cell development. We found that HS was expressed most abundantly on the thymic fibroblasts and at lower levels on endothelial, epithelial, and hematopoietic cells. To study the function of HS in the thymus, we eliminated most of HS in this organ by genetically disrupting the glycosyltransferase Ext1 that is essential for its synthesis. The absence of HS greatly reduced the size of the thymus in fetal thymic organ cultures and in vivo, in mice, and decreased the production of T cells. However, no specific blocks in T cell development were observed. Wild-type thymic fibroblasts were able to physically bind the homeostatic chemokines CCL19, CCL21, and CXCL12 ex vivo. However, this binding was abolished upon HS degradation, disrupting the CCL19/CCL21 chemokine gradients and causing impaired migration of dendritic cells in thymic slices. Thus, our results show that HS plays an essential role in the development and growth of the thymus and in regulating interstitial cell migration.

T cell development in the thymus occurs through a series of well-choreographed steps that result in the generation of major histocompatibility complex-restricted and self-tolerant repertoire of cells that can protect us from pathogen invasion. Successful transition of thymocytes between developmental stages requires input by various supporting cell types such as dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, thymic epithelial cells (TECs), and fibroblasts. For example, the commitment of the most immature progenitors to the T cell lineage requires Notch ligands expressed on epithelial cells (1Radtke F. Wilson A. Stark G. Bauer M. van Meerwijk J.

In addition to these cell-associated signals, thymocytes also need many soluble factors produced, mostly, by nonhematopoietic cells that maintain their viability, such as IL-7 (5Freeden-Jeffry von U.

The bone-marrow-derived precursors are attracted to the thymus by these four chemokines (7Krueger A. Willenzon S. Lyszkiewicz M. Kremmer E. Förster R.

Med. 2003; 198: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). These most immature progenitors do not express the coreceptors CD4 and CD8 and are called double-negative (DN) thymocytes. They are guided to the subcapsular zone of the cortex by CCL25 (11Benz C. Heinzel K. Bleul C.C.

DP thymocytes are the most abundant cell population in the thymus, and they occupy the majority of the cortex. They are thought to be retained there by the action of CXCL12 (12Halkias J. Melichar H.J. Taylor K.T. Ross J.O. Yen B. Cooper S.B. Winoto A. Robey E.A. Opposing chemokine gradients control human thymocyte migration in situ.J. Clin.

Cells that successfully rearrange the TCRα chain and pass positive selection then migrate to the medulla under the influence of CCR7 ligands, CCL19 and CCL21 (14Ueno T. Saito F. Gray D.H.D. Kuse S. Hieshima K. Nakano H. Kakiuchi T. Lipp M. Boyd R.L. Takahama Y. CCR7 signals are essential for cortex-medulla migration of developing thymocytes.J. Exp.

CCR4 promotes medullary entry and thymocyte-dendritic cell interactions required for central tolerance.J. Exp. Med. 2015; 212: 1947-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the process, they downregulate CD4 or CD8 and become lineage-committed CD4+CD8- or CD4-CD8+ single-positive (SP) cells. The importance of chemokines for successful T cell development is best illustrated in mice lacking CCL19 and CCL21 (plt mice) or CCR7-deficient mice, which do not efficiently migrate to the medulla following positive selection and fail to undergo negative selection to tissue-restricted antigens resulting in an autoimmune disease (16Kurobe H.

Fibroblasts are an important, yet relatively poorly understood, component of the thymus. They are cells of mesenchymal origin derived from the neural crest (17Muller S.M. Stolt C.C. Terszowski G.

Fibroblasts, together with epithelial cells, are the first components of the thymus anlage and play important roles in thymus organogenesis. In addition to providing structural foundation by building the capsule and the septae of the organ, they also ensheath the blood vessels (19Odaka C. Localization of mesenchymal cells in adult mouse thymus: Their abnormal distribution in mice with disorganization of thymic medullary epithelium.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2009; 57: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and elaborate growth factors, such as Fgf7, Fgf10, Igf1, and Igf2 and retinoic acid for epithelial cells (20Jenkinson W.E. Jenkinson E.J. Anderson G. Differential requirement for mesenchyme in the proliferation and maturation of thymic epithelial progenitors.J. Exp.

Mesenchymal cells regulate retinoic acid receptor-dependent cortical thymic epithelial cell homeostasis.J. Immunol. 2012; 188: 4801-4809Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Removal of the fibroblasts at embryonic day E12 from the thymus anlage leads to defective expansion of TECs and growth retardation of the whole organ (22Jenkinson W.E. Rossi S.W. Parnell S.M. Jenkinson E.J. Anderson G. PDGFRα-expressing mesenchyme regulates thymus growth and the availability of intrathymic niches.Blood. 2007; 109: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Yet, even under these conditions, the pattern of T cell development was not changed, suggesting that fibroblasts regulate it only indirectly through affecting epithelial cells proliferation. However, recently, fibroblasts were pointed out as an important source of self-antigen for the induction of central tolerance, suggesting that they can directly influence T cell development (23Nitta T. Tsutsumi M. Nitta S. Muro R. Suzuki E.C. Nakano K. Tomofuji Y. Sawa S. Okamura T. Penninger J.M. Takayanagi H. Fibroblasts as a source of self-antigens for central immune tolerance.Nature. 2020; 21: 1172-1180Google Scholar). Unfortunately, few studies have examined the effects on thymocytes of gene disruption, specifically in thymic fibroblasts (23Nitta T. Tsutsumi M. Nitta S. Muro R. Suzuki E.C. Nakano K. Tomofuji Y.

Thus, the role of fibroblast in the thymus is still unclear. Heparan sulfate (HS) is a negatively charged, linear, polysaccharide composed of alternating N-acetylated or N-sulfated glucosamine units and uronic (glucuronic or iduronic) acid. It is a major component of the ECM in all organs, and it is also present on the surface of many cells attached to proteins such as Syndecans and Glypicans (27Gallagher J. Fell-muir Lecture: Heparan sulphate and the art of cell regulation: A polymer chain conducts the protein orchestra.Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2015; 96: 203-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The main enzymes responsible for the HS polymer synthesis are the glycosyltransferases Ext1 and Ext2 (28McCormick C. Duncan G. Goutsos K.T. Tufaro F. The putative tumor suppressors EXT1 and EXT2 form a stable complex that accumulates in the Golgi apparatus and catalyzes the synthesis of heparan sulfate.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 668-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In the absence of Ext1, no HS is produced, and mice lacking Ext1 die during gastrulation (E6.5–8.5) before organs form, underscoring the importance of HS in a variety of developmental processes (29Lin X. Wei G. Shi Z. Dryer L. Esko J.D. Wells D.E. Matzuk M.M. Disruption of gastrulation and heparan sulfate biosynthesis in EXT1-deficient mice.Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The biological importance of HS lies in its ability to interact with more than 300 secreted proteins, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and morphogens. Binding of these ligands modifies their functions through immobilization, protection from degradation, and facilitation of their oligomerization and interaction with other proteins (30Xu D. Esko J.D. Demystifying heparan sulfate–protein interactions.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2014; 83: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Within the immune system, the role of HS has been studied in several different contexts. Many chemokines and cytokines that play important roles for the homeostasis of the immune system or during an immune response, such as CCL19, CCL21, CXCL12, IL-7, IL-2, IFNβ, CXCL2, and CXCL8, have been shown to interact with HS (31Bao X.

Moreover, deficiency of Glucuronyl C5-Epimerase (Glce), an enzyme that controls the flexibility of HS chains, leads to defective development of the lymphoid organs (41Reijmers R.M. Vondenhoff M.F.R.

HS on macrophages regulates IFNβ signaling and protects against obesity and atherosclerosis (35Gordts P.L.S.M. Foley E.M. Lawrence R. Sinha R. Lameda-Diaz C. Deng L. Nock R. Glass C.K. Erbilgin A. Lusis A.J. Witztum J.L. Esko J.D.

Thus, HS regulates many aspects of immune system development and function. However, the role of HS in thymus organogenesis and T cell development has received only limited attention. The only indication that HS might play a role in formation of the thymus comes from studies of Glce-/- mice that revealed defects in thymus positioning and lobulation without impaired T cell development (41Reijmers R.M. Vondenhoff M.F.R. Roozendaal R. Kuil A. Li J.-P. Spaargaren M. Pals S.T. Mebius R.E. Impaired lymphoid organ development in mice lacking the heparan sulfate modifying enzyme glucuronyl C5-epimerase.J. Immunol. 2010; 184: 3656-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, Glce-/- mice die at birth, and these studies could not be extended to adult mice. HS interacts with many of the chemokines and cytokines that are important for T cell development in the thymus, suggesting that it can play a vital role in the process. Intrinsic deficiency of HS modifying enzymes Ndst1 and Ndst2 in T cells does not lead to gross changes in T cell homeostasis (43Garner O.B. Yamaguchi Y. Esko J.D. Videm V. Small changes in lymphocyte development and activation in mice through tissue-specific alteration of heparan sulphate.Immunology. 2008; 125: 420-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, two recent studies showed that mutations in Extl3, another enzyme participating in the synthesis of HS, lead to T cell deficiency, suggesting that HS regulates T cell development in the thymus (44Volpi S. Yamazaki Y. Brauer P.M. van Rooijen E. Hayashida A. Slavotinek A. Sun Kuehn H. Di Rocco M. Rivolta C. Bortolomai I. Du L. Felgentreff K. Ott de Bruin L. Hayashida K.

In this study, we examined the importance of HS for thymus organogenesis and T cell development. The finding that HS expression is primarily restricted to thymic fibroblasts allowed us to devise a genetic strategy to eliminate the majority of HS in the organ. We explored the effects of HS absence using fetal thymic organ cultures (FTOCs) and embryonic thymus transplantation. Both methods showed a significant reduction in the size of the thymus, but a relatively normal developmental pattern of thymocytes. Part of the growth retardation could be attributed to defective interaction of HS with homeostatic chemokines that led to impaired interstitial migration of immune cells within the thymus. Thus, our study demonstrates that HS regulates thymus organogenesis, at least in part through facilitating motility inside the organ. We decided to characterize HS expression on the various cells within the thymus as a first step to understand its role in this organ. We used the 10E4 antibody, which recognizes a common HS epitope (46David G. Bai X.M. Van Der Schueren B. Cassiman J.-J. Van Den Berghe H. Developmental changes in heparan sulfate expression: In situ detection with mAbs.J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), to stain thymus single-cell suspension and examined the binding by flow cytometry (see Fig. S1 for gating strategy). HS was most abundant on CD45-EpCAM-gp38+ thymic fibroblasts (Fig. 1A). CD45-EpCAM+ TECs, CD31+ endothelial cells (ECs), and CD4SP thymocytes had lower HS on their surface. We could not detect HS on F4/80+ macrophages, thymic DCs, DN, immature single-positive cells (ISPs), DP, and CD8SP thymocytes. Confirming the antibody’s specificity, digestion of HS with Heparinase (HSase) completely abolished the staining (Fig. 1, B and C). As the 10E4 antibody does not recognize all possible HS structures, we confirmed our findings with the 3G10 antibody that recognizes all HS chains after digestion with HSase. Staining with 3G10 revealed that all cells in the thymus express HS (Fig. S2, A and B). However, the hierarchy of the expression levels was the same as uncovered with the 10E4 antibody; namely, fibroblasts had the highest HS expression, followed by ECs, and the hematopoietic cells. The fibroblasts’ ability to produce HS was not limited to the thymus, as lymph node (LN) gp38+CD31- fibroblasts and spleen PDGFRα+ fibroblasts were also positive for this glycosaminoglycan (Fig. 1D). When we quantified HS expression levels on different cell types, we found that thymic fibroblasts expressed significantly higher amounts of HS than any other cell type that we have examined (Fig. 1E). To confirm that the glycosyltransferases Ext1 and Ext2, which are responsible for the extension of the HS chain, are highly expressed in fibroblasts, we mined the IMMGEN database (www.immgen.org). In agreement with our flow cytometry data, the catalytic unit, Ext1, was expressed at the highest level in fibroblasts and, in particular, thymic fibroblasts (Fig. S3A). Among thymocytes, CD4SP expressed the highest levels of Ext1. The expression in other thymocyte populations and mTECs was relatively low. The chaperone unit, Ext2, did not vary as much among the different cell types but had the highest expression level in fibroblasts. We also used the RNA-Seq data from a recently published paper that examined different thymus fibroblast populations together with TECs, thymic ECs, and LN fibroblasts (23Nitta T. Tsutsumi M. Nitta S. Muro R. Suzuki E.C. Nakano K. Tomofuji Y. Sawa S. Okamura T. Penninger J.M. Takayanagi H. Fibroblasts as a source of self-antigens for central immune tolerance.Nature. 2020; 21: 1172-1180Google Scholar). This analysis confirmed that Ext1 and Ext2 are most highly expressed in thymus fibroblasts, followed by LN fibroblasts, ECs, and TECs (Fig. S3B). Both capsular and medullary fibroblasts expressed comparable levels of Ext1 and Ext2 mRNA. Based on RNA-Seq data and flow cytometry, we conclude that fibroblasts are the primary producers of HS in the thymus and other lymphoid organs. Immunofluorescent staining for HS revealed a perivascular and capsular staining pattern that colocalized with Laminin (Fig. 2A), a protein enriched in the basement membrane of blood vessels (47Hohenester E. Yurchenco P.D. Laminins in basement membrane assembly.Cell Adhes. Migration. 2014; 7: 56-63Crossref Scopus (252) Google Scholar). This result suggests that HS is enriched around blood vessels, where most fibroblasts are located (19Odaka C. Localization of mesenchymal cells in adult mouse thymus: Their abnormal distribution in mice with disorganization of thymic medullary epithelium.J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2009; 57: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To confirm this, we stained thymic sections with antibodies to HS and PDGFRβ, a marker for fibroblasts (48Sitnik K.M. Wendland K. Weishaupt H. Uronen-Hansson H. White A.J. Anderson G. Kotarsky K. Agace W.W. Context-dependent development of lymphoid stroma from adult CD34(+) Adventitial progenitors.Cell Rep. 2016; 14: 2375-2388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Indeed, HS and PDGFRβ signal colocalized to a great extent (Fig. 2B). In contrast, there was minimal overlap between Keratin 5 (K5), a marker for medullary thymic epithelial cells, and HS (Fig. 2C). Colocalization between HS and ECs was more challenging to measure because of the close apposition between ECs and the fibroblasts that ensheath them. Still, higher magnification images showed that HS staining overlapped better with PDGFRβ+ fibroblasts than with CD31+ ECs (Fig. 2D). Thus, our data show that HS is produced mostly by fibroblasts in the thymus and is localized predominantly around the blood vessels and in the organ’s capsule. To study the importance of HS for T cell development and thymus organogenesis, we wanted to develop a genetic model of HS absence in the thymus. Mice lacking HS die very early during embryogenesis (29Lin X. Wei G. Shi Z. Dryer L. Esko J.D. Wells D.E. Matzuk M.M. Disruption of gastrulation and heparan sulfate biosynthesis in EXT1-deficient mice.Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 299-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), underscoring the importance of this glycosaminoglycan for development. Thus, we decided to take a conditional knockout approach. Because of the highest abundance of HS on fibroblasts in the thymus, we reasoned that if we ablate its production in fibroblasts, the amount of HS in the organ will be greatly reduced, generating, in essence, an HS-deficient thymus. As PDGFRα is expressed on almost all fibroblasts in the thymus (48Sitnik K.M. Wendland K. Weishaupt H. Uronen-Hansson H. White A.J. Anderson G. Kotarsky K. Agace W.W.

https://openalex.org/W3131434665,"Reversible phosphorylation has emerged as an important mechanism for regulating 26S proteasome function in health and disease. Over 100 phospho-tyrosine sites of the human proteasome have been detected, and yet their function and regulation remain poorly understood. Here we show that the 19S subunit Rpt2 is phosphorylated at Tyr439, a strictly conserved residue within the C-terminal HbYX motif of Rpt2 that is essential for 26S proteasome assembly. Unexpectedly, we found that Y439 phosphorylation depends on Rpt2 membrane localization mediated by its N-myristoylation. Multiple receptors tyrosine kinases can trigger Rpt2–Y439 phosphorylation by activating Src, a N-myristoylated tyrosine kinase. Src directly phosphorylates Rpt2–Y439 in vitro and negatively regulates 26S proteasome activity at cellular membranes, which can be reversed by the membrane-associated isoform of protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 2 (PTPN2). In H1975 lung cancer cells with activated Src, blocking Rpt2–Y439 phosphorylation by the Y439F mutation conferred partial resistance to the Src inhibitor saracatinib both in vitro and in a mouse xenograft tumor model, and caused significant changes of cellular responses to saracatinib at the proteome level. Our study has defined a novel mechanism involved in the spatial regulation of proteasome function and provided new insights into tyrosine kinase inhibitor-based anticancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3131543417,"Introduction Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major increasing public health problem worldwide, with clinical and epidemiological differences between men and women. However, contemporary population-level data on incidence and survival are scarce. Aim To evaluate sex-specific contemporary trends in the incidence, prevalence, and long-term survival of non-valvular AF in a real-world setting Methods AF patients diagnosed between 2007–2015, insured by a large, state-mandated health organization in Israel (Maccabi Healthcare Services) were included. AF was diagnosed based on registered diagnoses. Patients with valvular disease, active malignancy, cardiac surgery ≤ 6 months, or recent pregnancy, were excluded. Annual incidence rate, period prevalence, and 5-year survival for each calendar year during the study period, were calculated. Results A total of 15,409 eligible patients (8,288 males, 7,121 females) were identified. Males were more likely to be younger, have higher rates of underlying diseases (ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), but with lower rates of hypertension and chronic kidney diseases as compared to female patients. During the study period, age-adjusted incidence decreased both in men: (-0.020/1,000-person year, p-for trend = 0.033) and, women (-0.025/1,000 person-year p = 0.009). The five-year survival rate was significantly higher among men vs. women (77.1% vs. 71.5%, respectively, p&lt;0.001). Age-adjusted prevalence increased significantly among men (+0.102 per year, p-for trend&lt;0.001) yet decreased among women (-0.082 per year, p-for trend = 0.005). A significant trend toward improved long-term survival was observed in women and not in men. Conclusions The current study shows significant sex-related disparities in the incidence, prevalence, and survival of AF patients between 2007–2015; while the adjusted incidence of both has decreased over-time, prevalence and mortality decreased significantly only in women."
https://openalex.org/W3130966174,"The appropriate regulation of T lymphocyte functions is key to achieve protective immune responses, while at the same time limiting the risks of tissue damage and chronic inflammation. Deciphering the mechanisms underpinning T cell responses in humans may therefore be beneficial for a range of infectious and chronic diseases. Recently, the development of methods based on CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing has greatly expanded the available tool-box for the mechanistic studies of primary human T cell responses. While the deletion of a surface protein has become a relatively straightforward task, as long as an antibody for detection is available, the identification and selection of cells lacking an intracellular protein, a non-coding RNA or a protein for which no antibody is available, remain more problematic. Here, we discuss the options currently available to scientists interested in performing gene-editing in primary human T lymphocytes and we describe the optimization of a workflow for the screening and analysis of lymphocytes following gene-editing with CRISPR-Cas9 based on T cell cloning and T7 endonuclease I cleavage assay."
https://openalex.org/W3132853273,"Bovine Respiratory Syncytial virus (BRSV) is one of the major infectious agents in the etiology of the bovine respiratory disease complex. BRSV causes a respiratory syndrome in calves, which is associated with severe bronchiolitis. In this study we describe the effect of treatment with antiviral fusion protein inhibitor (FPI) and ibuprofen, on gene expression in lung tissue of calves infected with BRSV. Calves infected with BRSV are an excellent model of human RSV in infants: we hypothesized that FPI in combination with ibuprofen would provide the best therapeutic intervention for both species. The following experimental treatment groups of BRSV infected calves were used: 1) ibuprofen day 3–10, 2) ibuprofen day 5–10, 3) placebo, 4) FPI day 5–10, 5) FPI and ibuprofen day 5–10, 6) FPI and ibuprofen day 3–10. All calves were infected with BRSV on day 0. Daily clinical evaluation with monitoring of virus shedding by qRT-PCR was conducted. On day10 lung tissue with lesions (LL) and non-lesional (LN) was collected at necropsy, total RNA extracted, and RNA sequencing performed. Differential gene expression analysis was conducted with Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. The most significant differential gene expression in BRSV infected lung tissues was observed in the comparison of LL with LN; oxidative stress and cell damage was especially noticeable. Innate and adaptive immune functions were reduced in LL. As expected, combined treatment with FPI and Ibuprofen, when started early, made the most difference in gene expression patterns in comparison with placebo, especially in pathways related to the innate and adaptive immune response in both LL and LN. Ibuprofen, when used alone, negatively affected the antiviral response and caused higher virus loads as shown by increased viral shedding. In contrast, when used with FPI Ibuprofen enhanced the specific antiviral effect of FPI, due to its ability to reduce the damaging effect of prostanoids and oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W3129849189,"Background G protein-coupled receptor kinase 6 (GRK6) is part of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase family, whose members act as key regulators of seven-transmembrane receptor signalling. GRK6 seems to play a role in regulation of inflammatory processes, but mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of GRK6 expression in inflammatory cell lines have not been characterized. Protein kinase C (PKC) signalling is also involved in inflammatory regulation and an impact of PKC activation on GRK6 protein expression was described previously. Thus, the aim of this study was to 1) characterize the GRK6 promoter, and 2) investigate a potential influence of PKC on GRK6 expression. Methods Five deletion constructs of the GRK6 promoter were cloned. After transient transfection into a human T cell line, promoter activity was assessed using luciferase reporter gene assays. Putative transcription factor binding sites were identified, mutated, and binding was investigated using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). Following stimulation with a PKC activator, GRK6 expression on mRNA and protein levels was assessed by reverse transcriptase qPCR and Western blots. Results Investigation of the GRK6 promoter revealed a putative cAMP responsive element (CRE), whose mutation led to decreased promoter activity (p = 0.0006). Functionality of the CRE binding protein (CREB) binding site was verified in EMSA blots. Stimulation with a PKC activator resulted in decreased GRK6 promoter activity (p = 0.0027), mRNA (p = 0.04) and protein expression. Conclusion We characterized the human GRK6 promoter and identified promoter activity to be influenced by a CREB binding site. PKC might be one determinant contributing to altered GRK6 expression."

In this study, it was tested whether any of the known human GOF disease mutations in KCNQ1 act by increasing the amount of KCNQ1 that reaches the cell surface—“supertrafficking.” Seven of the 15 GOF mutants tested were seen to surface traffic more efficiently than the WT channel. Among these, we found that the levels of R231C KCNQ1 in the plasma membrane were fivefold higher than the WT channel. This was shown to arise from the combined effects of enhanced efficiency of translocon-mediated membrane integration of the S4 voltage-sensor helix and from enhanced post-translational folding/trafficking related to the energetic linkage of C231 with the V129 and F166 side chains. Whole-cell electrophysiology recordings confirmed that R231C KCNQ1 in complex with the voltage-gated potassium channel-regulatory subfamily E member 1 not only exhibited constitutive conductance but also revealed that the single-channel activity of this mutant is only 20% that of WT. The GOF phenotype associated with R231C therefore reflects the effects of supertrafficking and constitutive channel activation, which together offset reduced channel activity.

LOF mutations cause type 1 long QT syndrome (LQTS) cardiac arrhythmia, a cause of sudden death. GOF mutations are much less common and cause other arrhythmias such as short QT syndrome and atrial fibrillation (AF). We recently conducted a study on 50 different mutant forms of KCNQ1 in which the single-mutation sites were all located in the voltage-sensor domain (VSD) (8Huang H. Kuenze G. Smith J.A. Taylor K.C. Duran A.M. Hadziselimovic A. Meiler J. Vanoye C.G. George Jr., A.L. Sanders C.R. Mechanisms of KCNQ1 channel dysfunction in long QT syndrome involving voltage sensor domain mutations.Sci. Adv. 2018; 4eaar2631Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It was seen that 31 of the mutants exhibited LOF, consistent with their association with LQTS. For a majority of these mutants, reduced cell surface channel levels were observed and documented to result from the combined impact of proteasomal degradation and impaired trafficking to the cell membrane. For the majority of LOF mutants, the most common underlying defect resulting in degradation or mistrafficking was seen to be destabilization of the folded state of the channel. These results provided a well-documented example of what is very likely a general principle regarding disease-promoting LOF mutations in human membrane proteins—that the most common cause of LOF is mutation-induced destabilization of the native conformation (9Marinko J.T. Huang H. Penn W.D. Capra J.A. Schlebach J.P. Sanders C.R. Folding and misfolding of human membrane proteins in health and disease: From single molecules to cellular proteostasis.Chem. Rev. 2019; 119: 5537-5606Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), leading to misfolding and, often, degradation via the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)–associated degradation pathway (10Guerriero C.J.

Biol. 2019; 218: 3171-3187Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The fact that LQTS-linked KCNQ1 LOF is commonly caused by reduced surface channel levels led us to hypothesize that known human disease mutations resulting in aberrant gain of KCNQ1 function might in some cases result from an increase in its cell surface level arising from elevated overall expression, decreased channel degradation, and/or enhanced surface-trafficking efficiency. In this article, we survey the known disease-linked GOF mutant forms of KCNQ1 and report that roughly half do indeed traffic to the cell surface more efficiently than the WT protein. Among these “supertrafficking” mutants, R231C stands out as an extreme example. Follow-up studies of this R231C mutant illuminate the biophysical basis for its supertrafficking trait and provide insight into how this mutation results in a complex disease phenotype in humans.

Each GOF variant was then transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, and the expression of each variant was measured by flow cytometry–based quantification of anti-myc immunostaining. Two distinct fluorescently tagged anti-myc antibodies were used to differentially label cell surface and intracellular KCNQ1 levels (8Huang H. Kuenze G. Smith J.A. Taylor K.C. Duran A.M.

From these measurements, it was possible to calculate the cell surface–trafficking efficiency, which is defined as [(level of KCNQ1 at surface)/(total cellular KCNQ1)] × 100. Results are shown in Figure 1. Panel 1A shows that GOF mutant forms of KCNQ1 exhibit a wide range of surface expression levels relative to WT, ranging from about 10% for G229D to 500% for R231C. Seven of the 15 GOF mutants were seen to traffic more efficiently than the WT KCNQ1. Of these, R231C stood out because of its fivefold more efficient trafficking to the plasma membrane relative to WT. R231C KCNQ1 is a supertrafficker. Because it represents an extreme example, we focused all our subsequent work on investigating R231C. The fivefold increase in surface expression of R231C reflects the combined effects of its 1.7-fold higher level of total expression relative to WT (Fig. 1B) and its threefold greater surface-trafficking efficiency (Fig. 1C). For R231C, the trafficking results shown in Figure 1 were not dependent on the expression system. Similar results were obtained when Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells (Fig. 1D) were used for channel expression instead of HEK293 cells. We also examined whether the coexpression of R231C affected the WT channel surface trafficking. When myc-R231C was cotransfected with myc-WT (same amount of total myc-R231C + myc-WT cDNA as myc-R231C cDNA in the previous experiments), the cell surface–trafficked myc-tagged protein is fourfold higher than when the myc-tagged WT channel is expressed alone (Fig. 1E). This indicates that coassembled WT/R231C KCNQ1 heterotetramers also supertraffic. Figure 2, A and B shows the single-cell trafficking efficiencies for WT and R231C expressing cells as a function of total cellular expression. The average trafficking efficiency of WT KCNQ1 is 15 ± 1% (SEM), whereas the trafficking efficiency of R231C is much higher with an average trafficking efficiency of 43 ± 2%. When these data were binned into ten equally sized cohorts (ranked by total expression in single cells), the single-cell trafficking efficiency of both WT and R231C KCNQ1 was seen to be inversely proportional to total single-cell expression (Fig. 2C). However, while R231C trafficking efficiency does decline with higher expression levels, the drop is not as steep as for WT (Fig. 2D). Figure 2, E and F provides further clarification by showing that as the total expression of both WT and R231C increase, the levels of both surface-trafficked and cell-internal KCNQ1 increase, but that for WT, the internally trapped fraction grows more steeply. This suggests that R231C undergoes forward trafficking through the protein-folding quality control system of the ER more readily than the WT channel. We considered the possibility that supertrafficking could be related to the disulfide bond formation between the introduced Cys231 in S4 and the only native cysteine residue in its general vicinity, C136, located in the S1 transmembrane helix. As shown in Figure 3, the C136A/R231C double mutant exhibits elevated cell surface levels similar to R231C, ruling out intramolecular disulfide bond formation as a causative or contributing factor to supertrafficking of this mutant. We also examined the consequences of mutating G229, I230, F232, or L233 to cysteine (instead of R231). None of these KCNQ1 mutants exhibited supertrafficking (Fig. 3), indicating that the supertrafficking effect of mutation to cysteine is specific to R231C. We next quantitated the expression and trafficking of a series of 13 R231 mutants (Fig. 4). R231C exhibits the highest level of expression as well as the highest surface expression and trafficking efficiency. However, other mutants exhibit supertrafficking to a lesser degree, with trafficking efficiencies on the order of twofold to threefold higher than the WT being observed for R231M, R231V, R231L, and R231Y. Conversely, substitution of R231 to more polar residues (lysine and glutamate) results in lower-than-WT total and surface expression levels. R231 is located within the S4 helix, a key element of the VSD of KCNQ1 and other voltage-gated ion channels. The S4 helix contains positively charged residues (Arg or Lys), which are uncharacteristic for a transmembrane helix (34Krepkiy D. Mihailescu M. Freites J.A. Schow E.V. Worcester D.L. Gawrisch K.

While these Arg and Lys residues are critical to the voltage-sensing function of S4, they potentially compromise the cotranslational membrane integration of this helix into the membrane of the ER (34Krepkiy D.

In the context of the full-length KCNQ1 channel, this would likely result in misfolding of the channel and failure to surface traffic. This is consistent with our observation that WT KCNQ1 traffics to the membrane surface with only roughly 15% efficiency (Fig. 2A). We hypothesized that substituting R231 with more hydrophobic residues would enhance membrane integration of S4 into the membrane of the ER, which in turn would increase the folding and trafficking efficiency of the channel. We first examined this issue by comparing the trafficking results of Figure 4 to the projected effects of these mutations on the membrane integration of S4 as predicted by the Hessa/White/Von Heijne “biological hydrophobicity scale,” a knowledge-based energy scale for the translocon-mediated membrane integration of nascent transmembrane helices (41Hessa T. Kim H. Bihlmaier K. Lundin C. Boekel J. Andersson H. Nilsson I. White S.H. von Heijne G.

Molecular code for transmembrane-helix recognition by the Sec61 translocon.Nature. 2007; 450: 1026-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Figure 5 shows that the surface level, total expression, and surface-trafficking efficiency of R231 variants are highly correlated with the predicted effects of these mutations on the transfer-free energy of the S4 helix. Overall, trafficking of the 13 mutants examined in this work appears to be closely related to mutation impact on the hydrophobicity of S4. However, as shown in Figure 5, A–C, R231C is an outlier that expresses and traffics at even higher levels than would be expected based on the trend for the other mutants. Indeed, its surface expression level is roughly twofold higher than expected based on the best linear fit of the site 231 mutant series expression levels to the Hessa/White/von Heijne predicted ΔΔG values. Based on these observations, it is unclear whether the deviation in expression caused by the R231C mutation stems from its effects on the membrane integration of the S4 helix, its impact on the structural properties of the full-length channel, or some combination of the two. To examine the effects of the R231C mutation on the topological preferences of S4, we experimentally measured the membrane integration of S4 variants bearing mutations at residue 231 in the context of a chimeric leader peptidase (Lep)/S4 helix fusion protein (41Hessa T. Kim H. Bihlmaier K. Lundin C. Boekel J. Andersson H. Nilsson I. White S.H. von Heijne G. Recognition of transmembrane helices by the endoplasmic reticulum translocon.Nature. 2005; 433: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). These Lep/S4 fusion proteins were expressed via in vitro translation in canine rough microsomes, and the membrane integration efficiency of each S4 variant was inferred from the relative abundance of the singly glycosylated Lep (indicating correct membrane integration of S4) and doubly glycosylated Lep (indicating aberrant lumenal translocation of S4) (Fig. 5, D and E). Consistent with observations for other ion channel S4 segments (38Hessa T. White S.H. von Heijne G. Membrane insertion of a potassium-channel voltage sensor.Science. 2005; 307: 1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 40Zhang L. Sato Y. Hessa T. von Heijne G. Lee J.K. Kodama I. Sakaguchi M. Uozumi N. Contribution of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions to the membrane integration of the Shaker K+ channel voltage sensor domain.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8263-8268Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the WT S4 segment of KCNQ1 exhibits a marginal propensity to partition into the membrane (ΔGapp = 0.56 ± 0.03 kcal/mol; Fig. S1A and Fig. 5E). Measured ΔGapp values plateau around a value of ∼0.6 kcal/mol for variants bearing non-native charges at residue 231, and the experimentally measured change in the apparent free energy of membrane integration relative to WT (ΔΔGapp) caused by these mutations is small relative to the predicted values (Fig. S1). This deviation between experiment and prediction for the polar substitutions likely reflects the limited dynamic range of this assay (38Hessa T. White S.H. von Heijne G. Membrane insertion of a potassium-channel voltage sensor.Science. 2005; 307: 1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 43Virkki M.T. Agrawal N. Edsbacker E. Cristobal S. Elofsson A. Kauko A. Folding of Aquaporin 1: Multiple evidence that helix 3 can shift out of the membrane core.Protein Sci. 2014; 23: 981-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the introduction of hydrophobic side chains at R231 clearly increases the efficiency of S4 membrane integration and decreases ΔGapp, as expected (Fig. 5E). With the exception of R231C, measured ΔΔGapp values are inversely correlated with the surface expression, total expression, and trafficking efficiency of full-length KCNQ1 mutants (Fig. 5, F–H). While this general correlation suggests that the KCNQ1 expression is highly sensitive to the topological energetics of S4, the observed deviation of R231C implies that the change in the membrane integration efficiency cannot fully account for its elevated surface trafficking—there must be at least one additional mechanism that contributes to its surface trafficking. We next sought to determine if interactions between the R231C side chain and those of proximal residues in the folded conformation of the KCNQ1 VSD contribute to channel supertrafficking. To identify the structural interactions that influence KCNQ1 trafficking, we quantitated the surface expression of a series of single and double mutants that selectively perturb possible contacts. Our initial strategy was based on the notion that surface expression should be negatively attenuated by single mutations that disrupt a critical interaction but restored or even enhanced by the introduction of the reciprocal (swapped sites) mutation. A positive result in such studies indicates what we refer to as “energetic linkage” of the two sites in a way that promotes folding and surface trafficking. Observation of any such energetic linkage may reflect not only direct physical action of the two sites but also an indirect interaction mediated through an allosteric network. We selected potential interacting sites with R231C using the available experimental structures for the fully activated human KCNQ1 channel (44Sun J. MacKinnon R. Structural basis of human KCNQ1 modulation and gating.Cell. 2020; 180: 340-347.e349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and intermediate-activated VSD (45Taylor K.C.

Upgraded molecular models of the human KCNQ1 potassium channel.PLoS One. 2019; 14e0220415Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Based on these structures, C231 is predicted to be close to or in contact with sites 143, 144, 212, 278, 281, and 299 in the fully activated state, 140, 163, and 209 in the intermediate state, and 129, 133, 166, and 167 in the inactive state (Fig. 6). To eliminate possible disulfide bond formation involving R231C, we sometimes used R231M (which also supertraffics) as the parent mutant, with key results then being validated by repeating measurements using R231C. Figure 7 shows that the reciprocal mutations of the side chain of R231C or R231M with the WT side chains of the following residues led to complete or near-complete loss of supertrafficking: S140, S143, T144, F167, S209, Y278, Y281, and Y299.

https://openalex.org/W3131544895,"Aims Limited causal evidence is available on the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and atrial fibrillation (AF) progression. Sex differences have been noted and may be relevant for AF progression. We investigated the association between the BMI Genetic Risk Score (GRS) and AF progression in men and women of the Groningen Genetic Atrial Fibrillation (GGAF) cohort. Methods and results The GGAF cohort (n = 2207) is a composite of 5 prospective cohorts with individuals of European ancestry. AF patients with genetic information, with at least 12 months follow-up and AF progression data were included. AF progression was defined as progression from paroxysmal to persistent/permanent AF, or persistent to permanent AF. A BMI GRS was constructed of genetic variants associated with BMI. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were performed in the total population and in men and women, separately. During a median follow-up of 34 [interquartile range 19–48] months 630 AF patients (mean age 62±11, 36% women, BMI of 28±5) were analyzed, and men and women developed similar AF progression rates (respectively 6.5% versus 6.1%). The BMI GRS was not associated with AF progression either as a continuous variable or in tertiles in the overall population. However, the BMI GRS was associated with the tertile of the highest BMI GRS in women (n = 225), also after multivariable adjustments of clinical risk factors (Hazard ratio 2.611 (95% confidence interval 1.151–5.924) p = 0.022). Conclusions Genetically-determined BMI is only associated with women at risk of AF progression. The results may be supporting evidence for a causal link between observed BMI and AF progression in women. We emphasize the need for further investigation of genetically determined BMI and observed BMI to optimize AF management in women with increased risk for AF progression."
https://openalex.org/W3133283630,"Abstract Uncovering the mechanisms that underpin how tumor cells adapt to microenvironmental stress is essential to better understand cancer progression. The HACE1 (HECT domain and ankyrin repeat-containing E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase) gene is a tumor suppressor that inhibits the growth, invasive capacity, and metastasis of cancer cells. However, the direct regulatory pathways whereby HACE1 confers this tumor-suppressive effect remain to be fully elucidated. In this report, we establish a link between HACE1 and the major stress factor, hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1α). We find that HACE1 blocks the accumulation of HIF1α during cellular hypoxia through decreased protein stability. This property is dependent on HACE1 E3 ligase activity and loss of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1), an established target of HACE1 mediated ubiquitinylation and degradation. In vivo, genetic deletion of Rac1 reversed the increased HIF1α expression observed in Hace1 –/– mice in murine KRas G12D -driven lung tumors. An inverse relationship was observed between HACE1 and HIF1α levels in tumors compared to patient-matched normal kidney tissues, highlighting the potential pathophysiological significance of our findings. Together, our data uncover a previously unrecognized function for the HACE1 tumor suppressor in blocking HIF1α accumulation under hypoxia in a RAC1-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W3130652792,"In my first undergraduate research position, I imagined I'd design creative experiments, collect interesting data, and engage in thought-provoking discussions about science. Then reality set in. I spent most of my summer washing glassware, making solutions, and completing basic protocols while my postdoc mentor caught up on email. On the rare occasions when I was instructed to do a real experiment, my brief “training” left me feeling woefully unprepared. But although I learned little science, I learned valuable lessons about mentoring.



> “A student's first taste of research can cement their enthusiasm for science.” 

During my college neuroscience classes, I had been captivated by the complexity of the brain and drawn to a field that addressed some of life's big questions: Who am I? What is consciousness? But my summer research experience left me with serious doubts about whether I was cut out for a career in science. One Saturday, I attempted an experiment my mentor had demonstrated a few days earlier—only to realize I had no idea what I was doing. I did the best I could. When I finished, I was mortified to discover I hadn't used one of the treatment tubes my mentor had prepared.

I worked in another lab later in college. The experience wasn't much better and my self-doubts persisted. However, to my surprise, my mentors—along with my teachers—encouraged me to apply to graduate school. I'm grateful, because I might not have had the confidence to carry on otherwise.

I'm also grateful because my former mentors, in demonstrating what not to do, showed me how to be a better mentor myself. When I became a graduate student, I made a point of treating the undergraduates I supervised the way I wish I'd been treated. Here are three keys to my approach:

MAKE IT INDIVIDUAL. My first mentor never asked me about my career goals—and because they never asked, I assumed they didn't care. I've since learned that in order to mentor effectively, it is critical to start with some simple questions: “Why do you want to do this research? What are you most interested in?” Only then can you form a mutually beneficial plan, forging a connection between the students' goals and your project. It's also helpful to pay attention to the conditions under which your students do their best work. For example, some may appreciate real-time support, but others may feel nervous if you're constantly looking over their shoulder.

INVEST TIME. I know it's tempting to relegate tedious tasks to undergraduates and cut corners in training to save valuable time. But investing time up front to explain and demonstrate scientific techniques will benefit everyone: The students will learn more and you'll have more capable assistants. I spend time training my students at the outset. I also supervise them regularly when they first set out to perform experiments on their own, gradually giving them more independence as they grow in ability. This allows me to correct missteps in real time, helping them gain good habits before bad ones develop.

DON'T IGNORE THE BIG PICTURE. Colleagues who view undergraduates as “just a pair of hands” often give their students a series of tasks without explaining the big-picture goals of the research. I think that's a big mistake. Students will get much more out of a research experience if they have “aha!” moments—if they can see their tasks in the context of broad scientific concepts and questions. You also stand to benefit because knowledgeable students will be more invested in your work, and they will be better able to troubleshoot experiments if problems arise. For everyone's sake, treat your students as you'd like to be treated: as a valued scientific colleague, not a pair of hands.

I'm glad I persisted in science despite lackluster early research experiences. But I worry others won't be so lucky. A student's first taste of research can cement their enthusiasm for science or discourage them for good, so it's important to make it rewarding."
